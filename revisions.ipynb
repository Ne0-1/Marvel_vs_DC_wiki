In the 1960s, Marvel decided to test bringing the character back as part of the Avengers, with the premise that the character had been frozen for the two decades since the war, and was \"haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society\".<ref name=\"Wright\" /> Live-action performances of the character in television and film serials began within a few years after its creation, with a [[Captain America (1990 film)|1990 feature film]] resulting in critical and financial failure.<ref name=\"EW92\" />\\n\\nIn the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Captain America. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name=\"BostonApril2012\" /> In 2005, Marvel received a $525&nbsp;million investment from [[Merrill Lynch]], allowing them to independently produce ten films, including \\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'.

Sixty years go by, and who are we today?

He was raised by his mother, a nurse, who died of [[tuberculosis]], leaving Rogers alone at the age of eighteen.{{efn|name=Civil War|As stated in the letter he wrote to Tony Stark at the end of \\'\\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\\'\\'.}} At just {{convert|5|ft|4|in|adj=on}} tall and weighing only {{convert|90|lb}}, Rogers was also afflicted with a number of medical issues including [[asthma]], [[scoliosis]], [[heart arrhythmia]], partial [[deafness]], [[stomach ulcers]], and [[pernicious anemia]].{{efn|name=Winter Soldier|As seen in a museum exhibit shown in \\'\\'[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]\\'\\'.}}\\n\\n===Becoming Captain America and battling Hydra===\\n{{further|Captain America: The First Avenger}}\\nAt the outset of [[World War II]], Rogers attempts to enlist in the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] but is repeatedly rejected due to his numerous health problems. In 1942, while attending the Stark Expo with his best friend, [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Bucky\" Barnes]], Rogers again attempts to enlist. Dr. [[Abraham Erskine (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Abraham Erskine]] overhears Rogers speaking with Barnes, and approves his enlistment due to his continued efforts to serve his country despite his physical handicaps. He is recruited into the [[Strategic Scientific Reserve]] (SSR) as part of a super-soldier experiment under Erskine, U.S. Army [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chester Phillips (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chester Phillips]], and British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peggy Carter]]. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Nazi officer [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Johann Schmidt]], head of the science division called [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]], underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side-effects. Rogers agrees to the treatment nonetheless and is injected with Erskine\\'s serum and doused with vita-rays. After Rogers emerges significantly taller and more muscular, an undercover assassin kills Erskine and flees. Rogers, using his remarkable speed and strength increase, pursues and captures the assassin, who reveals he is a Hydra agent and commits suicide with a [[cyanide]] capsule. With Erskine dead and the formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt takes advantage of the media hype around Rogers\\' actions, and has him tour the nation in a colorful costume with the title of Captain America to promote the sale of [[War Bond|war bonds]]. In 1943, Rogers would lose his virginity to a woman during the USO tour[https://amp.toofab.com/2022/08/18/chris-evans-she-hulk-captain-america-virginity/ .] \\n\\nWhile [[Italian campaign (World War II)|on tour in Italy]], Rogers learns that the 107th unit – Barnes\\' unit – was [[Missing in action|MIA]] in a battle against Schmidt\\'s forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard Stark]] fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the Hydra facility, freeing Barnes and 400 other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who reveals himself to be the \"[[Red Skull]]\" and escapes. Despite disobeying orders, Rogers is rewarded for his heroics and is formally promoted to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]. He recruits Barnes and several other elite soldiers, who were among the prisoners he rescued, to form a team called the [[Howling Commandos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howling Commandos]] to attack other Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a [[Captain America\\'s shield (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|circular shield]] made of [[Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|vibranium]], a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Over the next two years, Rogers and the Howling Commandos help to turn the tide of the war in favor of [[The Allies (WWII)|the Allies]]. The team eventually captures top Hydra scientist Dr. [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]] on a train, but Barnes falls to his presumed death during the battle. Using information extracted from Zola, Rogers leads an attack on the final Hydra stronghold to stop Schmidt from using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] on America’s cities. Rogers infiltrates the final Hydra base with the help of the SSR, including Carter who reveals her mutual romantic feelings toward Rogers and the two share a kiss before Schmidt escapes in an aircraft carrying the weapons and is pursued by Rogers. During the confrontation, the source of Hydra\\'s advanced weapons, the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]], is physically handled by Schmidt causing him to vanish within a bright light. The Tesseract is lost in the ocean and with no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating the bombs, Rogers reluctantly bids farewell to Carter via the plane\\'s communications system and crashes it and himself in the Arctic.\\n\\n===Adjusting to the modern era and the Battle of New York===\\n{{See|The Avengers (2012 film)|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}\\nIn 2011, Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] [[baseball]] radio broadcast that something is wrong, he flees outside and finds himself in present-day [[Times Square]], where [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] informs him that he has been frozen in [[suspended animation]] for nearly 70 years.\\n\\nRogers learns that most of his World War II-era comrades are deceased and he struggles to adjust to the modern world. In 2012, He is approached by Fury, who has activated the \"[[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Initiative]]\", with an assignment to retrieve the stolen Tesseract from [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]. Rogers agrees and is introduced to [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] by Agent [[Phil Coulson]]. In [[Stuttgart]], Rogers and Loki have a brief physical confrontation until [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] arrives, resulting in Loki\\'s surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D. on the [[Quinjet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Quinjet]], his brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. After a confrontation between Thor, Stark, and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helicarrier]].\\n\\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons much like Hydra had in the 1940s. Agents possessed by Loki, including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]], attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers work together to restart. Loki escapes, and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Rogers invites Barton to join the Avengers after he is freed by Romanoff from his mind control. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole in [[New York City]] above [[Stark Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Tower]] to allow the alien species of the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] to invade. However, Rogers successfully leads the Avengers in defending the city and they defeat and capture Loki. Following the battle, Rogers coordinates the search and rescue of injured civilians. Thor returns Loki to [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]] to face justice for his invasion and the Avengers go their separate ways. Rogers, with newfound purpose in the modern world, rides off on his motorcycle.\\n\\nSometime afterwards, Rogers in his Captain America uniform records a number of [[public service announcements]] for high school students, encouraging them to do things like maintain healthy lifestyles, obey rules, and practice patience.<ref>{{cite web |last1=O\\'Connell |first1=Sean |title=The Hilarious Story Behind Spider-Man: Homecoming\\'s Captain America PSAs |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1676730/the-hilarious-story-behind-spider-man-homecomings-captain-america-psas |website=cinemablend.com |publisher=[[Cinema Blend]] |access-date=April 29, 2021 |date=July 3, 2017}}</ref>\\n\\n===Dismantling Hydra and fighting the Winter Soldier===\\n{{See|Captain America: The Winter Soldier}}\\nIn 2014, Rogers works for S.H.I.E.L.D. in [[Washington, D.C.]] under Fury, while continuing to adjust to contemporary society. Rogers and Romanoff are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E.

Rogers and S.T.R.I.K.E successfully rescue the hostages, but Batroc escapes when Rogers discovers Romanoff has her own agenda: to extract data from the ship\\'s computers for Fury. Rogers returns to the [[Triskelion (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Triskelion]], S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites designed to preemptively eliminate threats against America. Rogers, citing his moral issues with such a program, expresses concern that the project will likely result in the deaths of innocent people. He visits an elderly Carter who expresses regret that Rogers never got to live the life he deserved.\\n\\nUnable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official [[Alexander Pierce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alexander Pierce]] to delay the project. Fury, ambushed by assailants led by the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]], escapes and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, but hands Rogers a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing Romanoff\\'s data. Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion, revealing evidence that Fury hired Batroc to hijack the ship as cover to retrieve the data, but when Rogers withholds Fury\\'s information, Pierce brands him a [[fugitive]]. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers escapes capture and meets with Romanoff. Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker below Camp Leigh, Rogers\\' old military training base in [[New Jersey]], where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola reveals that after S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded following World War II, Hydra has secretly operated within its ranks and creating world crisis that will eventually cause humanity to sacrifice freedom for security. A S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and the pair realize that Pierce is Hydra\\'s leader.\\n\\nRogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|USAF pararescueman]] [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], whom Rogers befriended earlier, and acquire his powered \"Falcon\" [[Wingsuit flying|wingpack]]. Deducing that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jasper Sitwell]] is a Hydra [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], they force him to divulge Hydra\\'s plan to use satellite-guided guns to eliminate individuals identified by an algorithm as a threat to Hydra. They are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, whom Rogers recognizes as Bucky Barnes, his friend who he thought had died during World War II. S.H.I.E.L.D. operative [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips. After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers\\' launch, Rogers exposes Hydra\\'s plot causing an internal conflict within S.H.I.E.L.D. Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson\\'s suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown into the [[Potomac River]]. Barnes rescues the unconscious Rogers and disappears into the woods. S.H.I.E.L.D. officially disbands and after Rogers recovers from his injuries, he and Wilson partner together to find Barnes.\\n\\n===Leading the Avengers and combating Ultron===\\n{{See|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}\\nIn 2015, in the [[Eastern Europe]]an country of [[Sokovia]], Rogers leads the Avengers against a Hydra facility to recover [[Loki\\'s scepter]]. They are attacked by the twins [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro Maximoff]], two superpowered experimental volunteers. The Avengers succeed in obtaining the scepter and Rogers captures Hydra leader [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Baron Strucker]]. Returning to the Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner use the scepter to complete Stark\\'s \"[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]\" global defense program. Afterwards, the Avengers host a celebratory party and Ultron reveals himself and attacks the team at the Avengers Tower, before escaping. In [[Johannesburg]], the Avengers confront and battle Ultron, Wanda, and Pietro. Rogers is subdued by Wanda after she produces hallucinatory visions to him of World War II and Peggy Carter. After Maximoff also causes the Hulk to ravage the city before being subdued by Stark, Rogers and the other defeated Avengers take refuge at Barton\\'s secret residence so they can recover. While there, they are encouraged by Fury to assemble and stop Ultron.\\n\\nIn [[Seoul]], Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton attempt to stop Ultron from uploading his network into a synthetic vibranium body powered by the [[Mind Stone]]. Rogers fights Ultron in an attempt to keep him from completing the upload. He is assisted by the Maximoff twins who side with the Avengers after learning Ultron plans to exterminate humanity. They retrieve the synthetic body, but Romanoff is captured. At the Avengers Tower, the Avengers have a dispute over the synthetic body which is activated and becomes [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]. Rogers and the Avengers then return to Sokovia, where they engage in a battle against Ultron and are able to defeat him, but at the cost of Pietro\\'s life and the complete destruction of the city. At the new Avengers Compound in [[Upstate New York]], Rogers and Romanoff begin training new team members Wanda, [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], Vision, and Wilson.\\n\\n===Sokovia Accords===\\n{{further|Captain America: Civil War}}\\nIn 2016, Rogers, Maximoff, Romanoff, and Wilson stop Rumlow, now working as a mercenary, from stealing a [[biological weapon]] from a lab in [[Lagos]]. Rumlow, who was previously a Hydra agent, attempts to kill Rogers with a [[suicide bomb]], but Maximoff saves him. However, she mistakenly kills several [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]n humanitarian workers in the process. This leads to [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]] informing the Avengers that the [[United Nations]]  is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a U.N. panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron\\'s creation and Sokovia\\'s devastation, while Rogers is hesitant to give the government that kind of control over the team.\\n\\n[[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]], seeking to destroy the Avengers as revenge for the death of his family in Sokovia, tracks down and kills Barnes\\' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes\\' Winter Soldier brainwashing. Barnes is framed for the [[Vienna]] bombing that kills King [[T\\'Chaka (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T\\'Chaka]] of Wakanda, and T\\'Chaka\\'s son [[T\\'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T\\'Challa]], the [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]], vows vengeance. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T\\'Challa and the authorities, but are apprehended. Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo sends Barnes on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and hides him. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the [[Siberia]]n Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in cryogenic stasis.\\n\\nRogers and Wilson go rogue; they recruit Barton, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]], and Maximoff to their cause. Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, Rhodes, Vision, T\\'Challa, and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the rogue Avengers. They fight at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] in Germany, until Romanoff helps Rogers and Barnes escape. Stark strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes after finding out about Zemo, but Zemo reveals footage of an automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 that contained Stark\\'s parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them. After an intense fight, Rogers disables Stark\\'s Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Rogers breaks his team out of the [[Raft (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raft]], and heads to Wakanda with Barnes, where Barnes chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. Wanted by the U.N. for breaking the Sokovia Accords, Rogers, Maximoff, Romanoff, and Wilson go into hiding, while Barton and Lang strike a deal with the government for [[house arrest]] so that they can be with their families.\\n\\n===Infinity War===\\n{{See|Avengers: Infinity War}}\\nIn 2018, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson rescue Maximoff and Vision in [[Scotland]] from [[Corvus Glaive (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Corvus Glaive]] and [[Proxima Midnight (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Proxima Midnight]], two of [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]\\' [[Children of Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|children]]. They return to the Avengers Compound, reuniting with Banner and Rhodes. Rhodes refuses Secretary Ross\\'s order to arrest Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, and Maximoff; and Rogers informs Ross they intend to defend the Earth against the incoming threat, with or without permission from the Sokovia Accords. The Avengers travel to Wakanda to have the Mind Stone removed from Vision without destroying him in the process. Rogers orders Maximoff to destroy the stone as soon as it is removed from his head. As Thanos\\' children and the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]] invade, Rogers, Barnes, Romanoff, Wilson, Rhodes, Banner, T\\'Challa, and the Wakandan armies mount a defense and get support when Thor, [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] arrive. Rogers attempts to rally the Avengers against Thanos who successfully destroys Vision, obtains the Mind Stone, and completes the Infinity Gauntlet. Rogers survives [[the Blip]], but is left defeated.\\n\\nReturning to the Avengers Compound, Rogers and Romanoff assess the worldwide casualties and discover that Thanos destroyed half of all living things. They are met by [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]], who arrives answering Nick Fury\\'s pager. After Danvers brings Stark and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]] to the Compound, Rogers leads a team consisting of Rocket, Danvers, Thor, Romanoff, Rhodes, Banner, and Nebula into space to hunt Thanos. They confront and subdue Thanos and are horrified to learn that he destroyed the stones to prevent his mission from ever being undone. Rogers watches an enraged Thor decapitate Thanos.\\n\\n===Avenging the fallen ===\\n{{See|Avengers: Endgame}}\\nIn 2023, Rogers leads a support group for grieving survivors in New York City. Rogers and Romanoff are shocked when Lang arrives at the Avengers Compound and explains that he has been trapped in the [[Quantum Realm]] for five years and suggests using it as a form of [[time travel]]. Rogers, Romanoff, and Lang visit Stark but he refuses to help. They meet Banner at a diner who agrees, however, their initial attempts at time travel are unsuccessful. Stark returns to the Compound, revealing he has unlocked the key to successful time travel, and he and Rogers conclude their nearly decade-long feud, reestablishing their trust in one another with Stark returning Rogers\\' shield. After Barton and Thor return to the Compound, the team formulates a plan and Rogers teams up with Stark, Banner, and Lang to travel to 2012 to retrieve the three Stones present in New York City during Loki\\'s invasion.\\n\\nThey succeed in securing the [[Time Stone]] and the Mind Stone, with Rogers having to fight the 2012 version of himself to facilitate this. However, after the [[Space Stone]] plan goes awry, it necessitates a trip to 1970 so that Stark can recover it from [[Camp Lehigh|a S.H.I.E.L.D. base]] in New Jersey, while Rogers finds [[Pym Particles (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pym Particles]] at the same base for their trip back. While in the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Rogers sees the 1970 version of Peggy Carter through a window. The Avengers return, save for Romanoff who sacrificed herself for the mission, and the original Avengers hold a silent mourning for her. After Rocket, Stark, and Banner create a gauntlet, Banner reverses the Blip. However, the 2014 version of Thanos emerges from the quantum realm and attacks the Avengers Compound.\\n\\nRogers, Stark and Thor engage Thanos and during the fight, Rogers proves worthy to wield Thor\\'s hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]]. Thanos proves too powerful and Rogers, bruised and battered with his shield in tatters, stands up alone to face Thanos and his entire army. However, the restored Avengers, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians]], the Wakandan army, [[Masters of the Mystic Arts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Masters of the Mystic Arts]], [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravagers]], and Asgardians arrive and Rogers rallies them all in a final battle against Thanos. With no other options for victory, Stark steals the Infinity Stones from Thanos and snaps his fingers. Thanos and his army disintegrate, and Stark dies while Rogers looks on in grief.\\n\\nAfter attending Stark\\'s funeral, Rogers reunites with Barnes, Wilson and Banner before returning the Infinity Stones and Mjolnir to their appropriate times and places. However, Rogers also decides to return to 1945 to reunite with Carter,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kandell |first1=Zachary |title=Avengers: Endgame Script Reveals What Year Steve Rogers Reunited With Peggy |url=https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-script-year-steve-rogers-peggy-reunite/ |website=cbr.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] |access-date=May 11, 2021 |date=December 9, 2019}}</ref> where he marries and lives a full life with her.

[[Joaquin Torres (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Joaquin Torres]] mentions to Wilson that discussions about Rogers\\' whereabouts have become an internet [[conspiracy theory]], and a common one is that he is hidden in a secret [[Lunar outpost (NASA)|moonbase]]. The government names [[John Walker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Walker]] as the new Captain America and gives him the shield.\\n\\nBarnes confronts Wilson, who reveals that he did not feel comfortable being Rogers\\' successor. Walker indicates his desire to fill Rogers\\' shoes but comes into conflict with Wilson and Barnes, who refuse to work with him and the [[Global Repatriation Council]] (GRC) in tracking down the [[Flag Smashers]], a group of terrorist super soldiers. Barnes introduces Wilson to [[Isaiah Bradley (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Isaiah Bradley]], an [[African-American]] successor to Rogers that he came into conflict with during the [[Korean War]]. Bradley was kept a secret (even from Rogers), imprisoned for thirty years, and experimented on by the government and Hydra. Wilson and Barnes learn that Bradley\\'s blood was used to create a new variation of the Super Soldier Serum for the [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Broker]] but was stolen and used by the Flag Smashers. [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]] destroys all but one of the remaining vials of the serum, which is secretly retrieved by Walker, who uses it and gains super soldier abilities. Walker murders a Flag Smasher with the shield while a horrified crowd watches and records him. Wilson and Barnes forcibly take the shield from Walker, who has the Captain America title stripped from him by the government. Wilson eventually takes up the mantle as Rogers intended. Wilson, with assistance from Barnes, Walker, and Sharon Carter, defeats the Flag Smashers, and Wilson convinces the GRC to end its forced [[Population transfer|resettlement]] practices. Wilson later has a memorial dedicated to Isaiah Bradley added to the Captain America museum exhibit. \\n\\nWhen the [[Eternals (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eternals]] reconvene, they ponder who will lead the Avengers now that Rogers and Tony Stark are both gone. [[Ikaris (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ikaris]] verbalizes a belief that he could lead the team, but [[Gilgamesh (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gilgamesh]] rebuffs the idea.  \\n\\nIn 2024, the [[Statue of Liberty]] is modified and undergoes construction to replace the torch with Captain America\\'s shield in honor of Rogers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bradley |first1=Bill |title=Marvel Is Replacing The Statue of Liberty With Captain America In Phase 4 |url=https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-captain-america-statue-liberty-replacement/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |access-date=22 November 2021 |date=18 November 2021}}</ref> However, this addition is damaged by [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Norman Osborn]] during a battle involving [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] and two versions of him from alternate realities, (dubbed \"[[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter-Two]]\" and \"[[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter-Three]]\").

After a brief confrontation, 2012-Rogers manages to put 2023-Rogers in a [[chokehold]] but is tricked into releasing him when 2023-Rogers, using his knowledge of future events, mentions Barnes being alive. 2023-Rogers uses Loki\\'s scepter to render 2012-Rogers unconscious.\\n\\n=== \\'\\'What If...?\\'\\' ===\\n{{See also|What If...?

After Carter recovers the Tesseract from Hydra, Howard Stark uses it to build a large [[Iron Man\\'s armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|mechanized suit of armor]] for Rogers. He is subsequently codenamed the \\'\\'\\'Hydra Stomper\\'\\'\\'. He and Carter bond and Rogers encourages her to prove her critics wrong. Rogers joins Carter\\'s Howling Commandos on a mission to assassinate the Red Skull. Rogers is caught off-guard on a train loaded with explosives. They detonate, causing an [[avalanche]] after which Rogers is presumed dead. In a final mission to stop Hydra at their research facility, the Commandos find a captured Rogers and the Hydra Stomper suit. The Commandos use a generator to repower the suit, and Rogers rejoins the fight. The Red Skull opens a portal to another dimension using the Tesseract, and an tentacled creature travels through, killing him. Carter and Rogers fight together against the creature, but Rogers\\' suit runs out of power, and Carter chooses to push the monster back through the portal herself.\\n\\nIn 2014, Carter and Romanoff find Rogers\\' Hydra Stomper armor aboard the \\'\\'Lemurian Star\\'\\', with Romanoff revealing that someone was inside.\\n\\n====Death of the Avengers====\\n{{Further|What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}\\nIn an alternate 2011, most of the original candidates for Fury\\'s Avengers Initiative are killed by a vengeful [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]]. Rogers is the only one to survive as he is still frozen in ice at the time. Following Pym\\'s defeat and Loki\\'s subjugation of Earth, Fury finds and prepares to release Rogers from the ice. Sometime later, Rogers joins Fury, Carol Danvers, and S.H.I.E.L.D. in fighting Loki and his [[Asgardians (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgardian]] army.

Today we have a lot of stretch fabrics and there weren\\'t any \\'technofabrics\\' then\", and called his design \"the most technically difficult\" of the Avengers\\' costumes.<ref name=\"ByrneTFA\" />\\n\\nFor \\'\\'Captain America: The Winter Soldier\\'\\' (2014), Evans trained in [[parkour]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[karate]], [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]], and [[gymnastics]], as the [[Russo brothers]] believed that bringing Rogers into the modern day also meant that he had studied and mastered modern fighting styles and techniques. The filmmakers also looked to make the character\\'s shield, which has traditionally been used for defense, a more offensive weapon.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /> For \\'\\'Avengers: Age of Ultron\\'\\' (2015), Evans said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for \\'\\'The Winter Soldier\\'\\' by working out up to an hour a day.<ref name=\"EvansInquirer\" /> Evans didn\\'t want to take a step back from the skills shown in \\'\\'The Winter Soldier\\'\\', and made sure Rogers\\' fighting style advanced, showing \"a consistent display of strength\" and having Rogers utilizing his environment.<ref name=\"FandangoAoU\" /> Evans\\' training regimen to get in shape for the role included weight lifting, which consisted of \"the classic bodyweight and bodybuilding stuff\", gymnastics and [[plyometrics]], while staying away from cardio-based exercises, along with a high-protein diet.<ref name=\"EvansBodyBuilding\" /> For \\'\\'Civil War\\'\\', his costume in the film received \"subtle changes to all the details and cut\" as well as its color, becoming a combination of the stealth suit from \\'\\'Winter Soldier\\'\\' and the \\'\\'Avengers: Age of Ultron\\'\\' (2015) suit.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /> In \\'\\'Avengers: Infinity War\\'\\' (2018), Rogers receives new vibranium gauntlets from [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]] to replace his traditional shield.<ref name=\"EWIW\" />\\n\\nIn his civilian attire throughout the series, it has been noted that Rogers \"tends to go for a very low key look ... based around very simple pieces that work together\".<ref name=\"TechnoB\" /> In his earliest appearance, designed by Sheppard, \"post-serum Steve was All-American in a devastatingly tight white tee and khaki pants\",<ref name=\"SyfyFashion\" /> while in \\'\\'The Avengers\\'\\' Byrne made him \"sophisticated enough to beautifully blend plaids and stripes.\"<ref name=\"SyfyFashion\" /> Costume designer [[Judianna Makovsky]] described his fashion evolution between \\'\\'Winter Soldier\\'\\' and \\'\\'Captain America: Civil War\\'\\' (2016) as becoming increasingly comfortable in his clothes.<ref name=\"MakovskyCW\" /> A \\'\\'New York\\'\\' magazine article, however, criticized his clothing across the series as being \"bereft of patterns, graphics, imagery or anything you couldn\\'t color in with one singular crayon\".<ref name=\"DworkenVulture\" />\\n\\n[[File:WLA3quarters.JPG|thumb|A restored [[Harley-Davidson WLA]]]]\\n{{anchor|Motorcycle}} In \\'\\'The First Avenger\\'\\', Rogers uses

30, 2021}}</ref>\\n\\n===Personality===\\nIn \\'\\'Captain America: The First Avenger\\'\\' (2011), Steve Rogers begins as a frail, sickly young man who is enhanced to the peak of human ability by an experimental serum in order to aid the United States in World War II.<ref name=\"EvansConfirmed\" /> Regarding the extent of the character\\'s abilities Evans remarked, \"He would crush the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. Any Olympic sport he\\'s gonna dominate. He can jump higher, run faster, lift stronger weight, but he can be injured. He could roll an ankle and be out for the season. He\\'s not perfect, he\\'s not untouchable. So a lot of the effects, if I\\'m going to punch someone they\\'re not going to put them on a cable and fly them back 50&nbsp;feet, but he\\'s going to go down, probably not getting back up, which I think humanizes it. It makes it something that, again, I think everyone can relate to a little bit more, which I really like.\"<ref name=\"SuperheroHypeTFA\" />\\n\\nEvans said that Rogers is much darker in \\'\\'The Avengers\\'\\' (2012): \"It\\'s just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You\\'ve got to imagine, it\\'s enough of a shock to accept the fact that you\\'re in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about ... He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they\\'re all dead. He\\'s just lonely. I think in the beginning it\\'s a fish-out-of-water scene, and it\\'s tough. It\\'s a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world.\"<ref name=\"EWAvengers\" /> Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, \"I think there\\'s certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they\\'re polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it\\'s pretty fun.\"<ref name=\"MTVAvengers\" /> A key moment in \\'\\'The Avengers\\'\\' occurs when Stark, who had been dismissive of Rogers at earlier points in the film, defers to Rogers as leader of the newly formed team to defend New York against a large-scale attack.<ref name=\"AVClubAvengers\" /> Describing his character\\'s continuing adjustment to the modern world in \\'\\'Captain America: The Winter Soldier\\'\\' (2014), Evans said, \"It\\'s not so much about his shock with [technology]... It\\'s more about the societal differences. He\\'s gone from the \\'40s to today; he comes from a world where people were a little more trusting, the threats not as deep. Now, it\\'s harder to tell who\\'s right and wrong. Actions you take to protect people from threats could compromise liberties and privacy. That\\'s tough for Steve to swallow.\"<ref name=\"/FilmTWS\" />\\n\\nIn his next appearance, in \\'\\'Avengers: Age of Ultron\\'\\' (2015), Rogers is the leader of the Avengers.<ref name=\"MTVAoU\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyAoU\" /> Evans stated that since the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers has been left to depend on his Avenger teammates without the structure of military life and is now \"looking to understand where he belongs, not just as a soldier, as Captain America, but as Steve Rogers, as a person.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedAoU\" /> In \\'\\'Captain America: Civil War\\'\\' (2016), Rogers becomes the leader of a faction of the Avengers against regulation.<ref name=\"VarietyCW\" /><ref name=\"FandangoCW\" />  Director Anthony Russo described Captain America\\'s character arc in the film as taking him \"from the most ra-ra company man\" and \"a somewhat willing propagandist\" to \"an insurgent\" at the end of the film.<ref name=\"RussosEmpire\" /> Unlike the comics\\' Civil War, the film was never going to kill Rogers, as the directors thought that was \"an easy ending ... The more difficult and more interesting place to leave a family fight is: can these important relationships ever be repaired? Is this family broken permanently?\"<ref name=\"Empire12Secrets\" />\\n\\nDirector Joe Russo said that after the events of \\'\\'Civil War\\'\\', Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others.<ref name=\"RussosHuffPost\" /> In \\'\\'Avengers: Infinity War\\'\\' (2018), the character embodies the \"spirit\" of his comic alternate identity [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] in the film.<ref name=\"NotNomad\" /> An early draft of the film experimented with Rogers first appearing in the film saving Vision from Corvus Glaive during the third act. Markus and McFeely said they were called \"insane\" for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was \"not [a] satisfying\" approach.<ref name=\"RogersLateEntry\" />\\n\\nIn \\'\\'Avengers: Endgame\\'\\' (2019), Christopher Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest.\" Both he and McFeely knew he was going to get \"the dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in \\'\\'The First Avenger\\'\\', with McFeely saying, \"He\\'s postponed a life in order to fulfill his duty. That\\'s why I didn\\'t think we were ever going to kill him. Because that\\'s not the arc. The arc is, I finally get to put my shield down because I\\'ve earned that.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesEndgame\" />\\n\\n==Differences from the comic books==\\nThe origin story of Captain America follows that of the comic books, particularly [[Ultimate Marvel]] for certain elements like growing up in Brooklyn and Bucky being a childhood best friend rather than being met later, but diverges from there. Rogers is also a founding Avenger, unlike in the comics where he is a later addition to the roster and the formed Avengers are the ones who thaw him out of the ice.<ref name=\"ComicsSR\" /> In the comic books, Steve Rogers is murdered at the event of the \\'\\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\\'\\' storyline, leading to Bucky Barnes becoming the next Captain America. In the MCU, Rogers survives \\'\\'Civil War\\'\\',<ref name=\"ComicsCB\" /> eventually passing the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson in \\'\\'Avengers: Endgame\\'\\'.<ref name=\"EndgameEnding\" /> In the comics, Wilson became Captain America in 2014 after Rogers\\' aging accelerated to be the real age of 90.<ref name=\"CapVol7\" />\\n\\n==Reception==\\n{{see also|Stucky (fandom)}}\\nEvans\\' portrayal of the character has been positively received by fans and critics. Roger Moore of the \\'\\'[[Orlando Sentinel]]\\'\\' positively reviewed Evans\\' performance as Steve Rogers, writing that Evans \"brings a proper earnestness to the character\".<ref name=\"OrlandoSentinel\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] described the character as \"a hero we care about and who has some dimension\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Likewise, in his review of \\'\\'[[Avengers: Endgame]]\\'\\', [[Joe Morgenstern]] of \\'\\'[[The Wall Street Journal]]\\'\\' lauded both actor and character, calling \"Chris Evans\\'s effortlessly likable Steve Rogers/Captain America, the team\\'s natural leader.\"<ref name=\"MorgensternWSJ\" />\\n\\nPeter DeBruge, writing for \\'\\'[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\\'\\', had a more critical take, finding that \"as Marvel heroes go, Captain America must be the most vanilla of the lot\", and that because of his quick healing and fighting abilities, \"there\\'s never the slightest concern that the Nazis might get the better of him\".<ref name=\"DeBrugeVariety\" /> In 2015, \\'\\'[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]\\'\\' named Captain America the 46th greatest film character of all time.<ref name=\"EmpireGreatest\" /> In a December 2017 interview with \\'\\'[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]\\'\\', Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige called Evans \"a great actor\" and \"a reluctant star\". He compared his portrayal of Captain America with [[Christopher Reeve]]\\'s [[Superman (Salkind films)|Superman]] for the strong association between the actors and their respective characters.<ref name=\"FeigeInterviewVanityFair\" />\\n\\nRogers\\' elderly appearance at the end of \\'\\'Avengers: Endgame\\'\\' has been noted to resemble [[U.S. President]] [[Joe Biden]], which Evans acknowledged.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leishman |first=Rachel |date=November 11, 2020 |title=Confirmed: Chris Evans Joked to Me About Old Man Steve Rogers Looking Like Joe Biden |url=https://www.themarysue.com/chris-evans-knows-he-looks-like-joe-biden/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112013621/https://www.themarysue.com/chris-evans-knows-he-looks-like-joe-biden/ |archive-date=November 12, 2020 |access-date=May 24, 2022 |website=[[The Mary Sue]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cavalluzzi |first=Andrew |date=November 18, 2020 |title=Avengers: Endgame Deepfake Casts Joe Biden as Old Captain America |url=https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-deepfake-joe-biden-captain-america/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119051133/https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-deepfake-joe-biden-captain-america/ |archive-date=November 19, 2020 |access-date=May 24, 2022 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> His quote \"No, I don\\'t think I will\" has also become the subject of several [[Internet memes]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Armitage |first=Helen |date=December 5, 2019 |title=What Captain America\\'s \"No, I Don\\'t Think I Will\" Line Means |url=https://screenrant.com/captain-america-dont-think-will-meme-explained/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227173113/https://screenrant.com/captain-america-dont-think-will-meme-explained/ |archive-date=December 27, 2019 |access-date=July 21, 2021 |website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref>\\n\\n===Accolades===\\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\\n|-\\n!

Created by [[cartoonist]]s [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in \\'\\'[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]\\'\\' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics\\' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the \\'\\'Captain America\\'\\' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.\\n\\nThe character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America\\'s shield|nearly-indestructible shield]] that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of \\'\\'\\'Steve Rogers\\'\\'\\', a frail young artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental \"[[Captain America#Super Soldier Serum|super-soldier serum]]\" after joining the military to aid the [[United States]] government\\'s efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure both with the American public and in the superhero community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\\n\\nCaptain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]], \\'\\'[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]\\'\\'.

Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character\\'s stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:\\n\\n{{blockquote|I didn\\'t have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp;... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby\\'s. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new \\'\\'Captain America\\'\\' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. \"You\\'re still number one, Jack,\" I assured him. \"It\\'s just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll make the deadline,\" Jack promised. \"I\\'ll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.\" I hadn\\'t expected this kind of reaction&nbsp;... but I acceded to Kirby\\'s wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby&nbsp;... I wrote the first \\'\\'Captain America\\'\\' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.\"<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}\\n[[File:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|left|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon\\'s original sketch of Captain America]]\\nAl Lieberman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby\\'s regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>\\n\\nSimon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States\\' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: \"The opponents to the war were all quite well organized.

In the \\'\\'Secret Wars\\'\\' title, Captain America goes against Miguel Stone\\'s orders to treat the Defenders as criminals and worked with the Defenders and Avengers to stop Baron Mordo and the Dweller-In-Darkness.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\\n\\nFollowing \\'\\'Secret Wars\\'\\', Roberta is transported to the prime Marvel Universe with hallucinations of her past life. She was a supporting character in the All-New, All-Different Marvel \\'\\'Spider-Man 2099\\'\\' comic, where she was an employee at Parker Industries with Miguel O\\'Hara as her boss. After Roberta\\'s powers resurface again, she becomes a recurring ally for Spider-Man 2099. During the \\'\\'[[Civil War II]]\\'\\' storyline, Roberta goes back to 2099 to find her family, despite Miguel\\'s warnings. The Public Eye attempt to arrest her, until she is rescued by Ravage 2099. In the present, Miguel receives a call from Peter Parker, who tells him of a vision the Inhuman [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses]] had of the future: the death of Roberta Mendez. He goes back to 2099.<ref>\\'\\'Spider-Man 2099\\'\\' (vol. 3) #13</ref> Roberta learns from Ravage about the Anti-Powers Act, a law outlawing superpowers. Roberta and Ravage are taken to the downtown area by Hawkeye 2099, where they meet the remaining heroes. Spider-Man convinces Doctor Strange 2099 to help him out in exchange for his help in eliminating the A.P.A. Meanwhile, the CEO of Alchemax calls on [[Power Pack]] to defeat the heroes. Upon finding Roberta, Strange takes Spider-Man downtown, while Roberta leaves to find her husband upon learning his location. Roberta finds her husband Harry, who claims that she died and that they do not have kids, and gets captured by Power Pack. After Strange reveals that the CEO of Alchemax is [[J. Jonah Jameson]], Spider-Man rallies the heroes to launch an assault on S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ and rescue Roberta. In the process, they discover that \"Jameson\" and \"Power Pack\" are actually Skrull impostors. Spider-Man and Roberta then go back to 2016 to restore the timeline.<ref>\\'\\'Spider-Man 2099\\'\\' (vol. 3) #14-16</ref> In the book\\'s ending, Roberta and Miguel\\'s son save Miguel from death and return to 2099 on New Year\\'s Eve.

Secretly, he is a [[vampire]] along with his version of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], and plots to enter the [[Earth-616|616]] universe for sustenance. To accomplish this, he has already killed his world\\'s version of [[Reed Richards|Mister. Fantastic]]. However, it is revealed that the vampire Captain Ape-Merica was really [[Baron Blood]], who took on Cap\\'s form and increased his strength through the Super-Soldier Serum inside him. The real Captain Ape-Merica was still frozen in ice up to the modern era, and helped the [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]] fight off the vampire [[Namor]]. Afterwards, they stop Baron Blood. This version of Captain Ape-Merica turns out to be nearly as brutal as his impersonator; for example he is willing to kill Spider-Monkey for the \\'crime\\' of helping innocent dimensional travelers.<ref>\\'\\'https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Apes-Evolution-Starts-Here/dp/0785139915\\'\\'</ref>\\n\\nCaptain Ape-Merica is among the Captain America variants recruited by Ghost Rider, his Deathlok companion, and Ant-Man of Earth-818 to help train the Steve Rogers variants in preparation for the war against the Multiversal Masters of Evil.<ref name=\"Avengers: Forever #2\"/>\\n\\n===Marvel Mangaverse===\\nIn the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] reality, the original Captain America is decapitated and killed by Doctor Doom, but [[Carol Danvers]] assumes the identity. This is done mostly out of a desire of self-defense, but she is encouraged to keep it for the foreseeable future by [[Sharon Carter]]. The original Mangaverse Captain America is both the leader of the Avengers and the President of the United States. His costume gives him the power to generate and manipulate energy shields.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\\n\\n===Marvel Zombies===\\nIn the 2005–2006 miniseries \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies]]\\'\\', and the follow-up 2007 \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]\\'\\', Captain America is known as \\'\\'\\'Colonel America\\'\\'\\' and once served as the [[President of the United States]]. He is among the superheroes infected, along with his other fellow Avengers, by the zombified [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]]. Colonel America is responsible for infecting [[Spider-Man]] in \\'\\'Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness\\'\\' by biting him on the shoulder. He is apparently killed by a zombie [[Red Skull]], who rips off his left arm and scoops his exposed brains out before he himself is decapitated by a zombified Spider-Man. Zombie Ant-Man then steps on the [[Red Skull]]. As his intellect was partly retained in the remaining portion of his brain, he was transplanted into [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]\\'s son T\\'Channa\\'s dead body, and given a mechanical left arm. The transplant is successful, but the resulting brain damage turns Colonel America into a battle-crazed zombie leader, manageable but unable to focus on anything that is not related to war, confrontation, and battle. Colonel America (Steve Rogers/T\\'Channa) also has a role in \\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies Return]]\\'\\', where he was transported to Earth-Z.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\\n\\n\\'\\'[[Marvel Zombies 3]]\\'\\' features a zombie version called \"Captain Mexica\", who comes from an alternate universe in which the [[Aztec]] Empire in [[Mexico]] never fell. He is killed after Machine Man cuts him in half.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\\n\\n===MC2===\\nIn the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Captain America leads the original Avengers on a mission to an alternative reality, which claims the majority of the team. He stays behind to aid the rebels in that reality, thus adding to the list of the dead / [[missing in action]]. The next iteration of MC2 Avengers aids him in \\'\\'[[A-Next]]\\'\\' #10-11, at the end of which he gives [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] the shield that had belonged to that universe\\'s Captain America. Captain America and [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Thunderstrike]] return to their home universe to aid in the fight against [[Seth (comics)|Seth]]<ref>\\'\\'[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]\\'\\' #59. Marvel COmics.</ref>\\n\\nIn the 2005 limited series \\'\\'[[Last Hero Standing]]\\'\\', the MC2 Captain America is fatally injured leading a group of young heroes in battle against the Norse god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] uses his power to transform Captain America into a new star. In the sequel, \\'\\'[[Last Planet Standing]]\\'\\', [[Galactus]] states that this new star is the key to his escaping his world-devouring hunger{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.\\n\\n===Mutant X===\\nIn the \\'\\'[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]\\'\\' universe, a mutant succeeds Rogers as Captain America, joining [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]\\'s team of superheroes, \"The Six\", in order to protect mutants from a deranged Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. He has powerful energy manipulating abilities which manifest when America is threatened. Using that power he manages to kill a platoon of Super Soldiers and the Avengers, which consist of Black Widow, Deathlok, Typhoid Mary, Hawkeye and Iron Giant Man ([[Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark]]). He is defeated by Havok and is then drawn below the earth by [[The Beyonder]] who kills him after he finds out what he needs to know.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\\n\\n===Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.===\\nCaptain America is mentioned several times in \\'\\'Nextwave\\'\\', usually by [[Monica Rambeau]] (who constantly talks about her time as an Avenger). At one point, Monica theorizes that Captain America is secretly gay, as he was the only Avenger who never hit on her (Tabitha Smith agrees that it would be cool if that were true and that it would explain why \"people always dress like him at gay pride marches\"){{issue|date=February 2013}}\\n\\nHe appears in a flashback Monica has, when the Avengers are attacked by naked enemies. He tells her to \"cover your eyes, go back to the mansion, and make my dinner\".{{issue|date=February 2013}}\\n\\n===Old Man Logan===\\nIn this [[Old Man Logan|potential future]], all the Marvel Universe superheroes were killed when the supervillains combined forces. The villains then conquer and divide up control of the United States.  Captain America is shown in a flashback as having been killed by the Red Skull in the ruins of the [[U.S. Capitol]]. The Red Skull subsequently takes Cap\\'s costume and wears it as [[President of the United States|President of America]].<ref>\\'\\'Wolverine\\'\\' vol. 3 #72 (June 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>\\n\\n===Peggy Carter===\\n{{main|Peggy Carter#Captain Carter}}\\n\\n===Ruins===\\n[[Warren Ellis]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]\\'\\' limited series explored a version of the Marvel Universe where \"everything went wrong\". In this continuity, Captain America himself makes no physical appearance in the series aside from the cover for issue #1 and in a dream sequence in issue #2. He was a member of the Avengers, a revolutionary cell formed by Tony Stark bent on liberating California from the corrupt rule of President Charles Xavier, but along with many other members of the team, he is killed aboard the Avengers Quinjet. His shield is recovered by soldiers who celebrate the deaths of the Avengers. A part of the Captain\\'s war history is touched upon by the now-psychotic Nick Fury, who was ordered to destroy the Quinjet by the President: \"...I\\'ll give you an anecdote. Back in the war, it was America introduced me to eating human meat.\"<ref>\\'\\'Ruins\\'\\' #1-2 (August 1995 - September 1995)</ref>\\n\\n===Spider-Gwen===\\nCaptain America is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent on [[Spider-Gwen|Earth-65]], who apprehends [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] during her battle with the Lizard (this reality\\'s Peter Parker). This Captain America is an African American woman named \\'\\'\\'Samantha Wilson\\'\\'\\' a genderbent version of [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson/Falcon]].<ref>\\'\\'Radioactive Spider-Gwen\\'\\' #1</ref> During the 1940s, Samantha volunteered for Project: Rebirth after other test subjects were shot and killed or badly injured by Nazis. She became trapped in an alternate dimension after seemingly sacrificing herself to stop [[Arnim Zola]], but later managed to return home to find that 75 years had passed.<ref>\\'\\'Radioactive Spider-Gwen\\'\\' #2</ref> Steve Rogers would go on to become a famous comic creator, who writes stories of Samantha\\'s dimensional journeys that he saw in his dreams, which Sam confirmed as being accurate.<ref>\\'\\'Spider-Gwen Annual\\'\\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===Spider-Island===\\nIn this retelling of \\'\\'Spider-Island\\'\\' as part of the \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline, Captain America and the other heroes are mutated into monster spiders and he is still the Spider Queen\\'s \"Spider King\" in the Battleworld domain of Spider-Island. However, Agent Venom gives Captain America the Godstone and turns him into a Man-Wolf (as an homage to the time when Captain America was a werewolf called Capwolf), releasing Steve from the Spider Queen\\'s control. He uses his new form to fight for the resistance.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\\n\\n===Spider-Man: Life Story===\\n\\'\\'Spider-Man: Life Story\\'\\' takes place in an alternate continuity where characters naturally age after Peter Parker debuts as Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Captain America is pressured by the public to join the efforts in Vietnam and decides to go to see the conflict for himself. A year later, American soldiers label Steve as a traitor when he decides to protect a Vietnamese village. Captain America also gets himself involved in the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Civil War]] in the 2000s. In the 2010s, it is unknown if he is dead or in hiding after Doctor Doom took over the planet.<ref>\\'\\'Spider-Man: Life Story\\'\\' #1-6 (March 2019)</ref>\\n\\n===Truth: Red, White & Black===\\n{{Main|Truth: Red, White & Black}}\\nIn the 2003 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] \\'\\'[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]\\'\\', black soldiers act as test subjects for the WWII Super-Soldier program of 1942. Most of the subjects die, or become deformed with the exception of one, [[Isaiah Bradley]]. Isaiah substitutes for Captain America on an assignment, discovering Jewish concentration camp detainees subjected to experiments.<ref>\\'\\'Truth: Red, White & Black\\'\\' #1-7 (January 2003 - July 2003)</ref>\\n\\nIn \\'\\'Captain America\\'\\' (vol. 4) #28 (August 2004), an [[Isaiah Bradley]] from an alternative Earth became Captain America and never married. Later, he is elected president and serves two terms. He travels back in time, accidentally crossing to [[Earth-616]], and brings the mainstream Captain America and Rebecca Quan forward into his own time to prevent his daughter, Rebecca \"Becky\" Barnes, from traveling to Earth-616.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\\n\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\n{{Main|Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)}}\\n\\nIn addition to the WWII era hero, a 1960s version of Captain America (a.k.a. \"Captain America of the Vietnam War\") exists as an [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe parallel to the [[Grand Director|William Burnside/Captain America of the 1950s]], who succeeded Rogers in the role after he is accidentally frozen. The 1960s Captain America is in fact Frank Simpson, better known in the Earth-616 Marvel Universe as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]]. As scientists were unable to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum, they used cybernetics and steroids to enhance Simpson, which eventually eroded his sanity.<ref>\\'\\'Ultimate Comics Captain America\\'\\' (vol. 1) #1 (Mar 2011)</ref>\\n\\n====Scott Summers====\\nIn an [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Fantastic Four/Ultimate X-Men Annual #1|alternate future of the Ultimate Universe]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] assumes the mantle of Captain America after Steve Rogers dies and leads a small team of [[X-Men]] to fight for mutant justice.<ref>\\'\\'Ultimate Fantastic Four/Ultimate X-Men Annual\\'\\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===Weapon X: Days of Future Now===\\nSteve Rogers is selected for the Weapon X program. He is given a procedure similar to Wolverine\\'s that bonds vibranium to his skeleton. He is given the code name Vibram.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\\n\\n===What If?===\\nAlternative versions of Steve Rogers are seen within several issues of the \\'\\'[[What If (comics)|What If?]]\\'\\' series.\\n\\n* In \"What If Captain America and Bucky Had Both Survived World War Two?\", Steve is able to hold onto the drone plane and deactivate the bomb, allowing both men to survive. Baron Zemo is shot by the Red Skull for failing to kill Captain America and Bucky, but it is later revealed that the Skull shot him with a weapon which put him to sleep for 20 years. Bucky and Cap continue to fight in the 1950s and 1960s against Communists, though tragically Nick Fury is killed in the Korean War.  In the mid-1960s, Bucky goes his own way. Contacted by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the aged Steve is offered the job as the head of the newly created [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but Steve declines and suggests Barnes instead.  S.H.I.E.L.D. and Barnes battle HYDRA, but fail to capture the Supreme Hydra. Joining Steve on one of his missions, the pair run into the Hulk and Rick Jones. Steve is knocked out, forcing Bucky to use Cap\\'s shield and rescue Rick from the Hulk\\'s rampage. Bucky decides to take on the role of Captain America, to which Steve agrees. Overhearing the conversation, Rick light-heartedly blackmails the two for the chance to be the new Bucky. Steve becomes the new leader of S.H.I.E.L.D..  Tracking the final group of HYDRA to an uncharted island, Steve and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter team up with the new Cap and Bucky. The group infiltrate the island\\'s volcano, which turns out to be fake and created as a hideaway for HYDRA forces.  The four are captured, and the Supreme Hydra is revealed to be Baron Zemo, who has not aged for 20 years due to the Red Skull\\'s weapon. Believing that Captain America is still Rogers, he prepares to kill Bucky, but Steve escapes his cuffs and frees the others. A fierce battle ensues, resulting in Zemo\\'s death, but not before a shot from Zemo\\'s gun hits and kills Bucky. The story ends with a distraught Steve mourning the loss of his friend, and the possibility of Rick Jones becoming the new Captain America.<ref>\\'\\'What If?\\'\\' (vol. 1) #5 (Oct 1977)</ref>\\n* \"What If...Captain America Fought in the Civil War?\" features a continuum where Captain America lived during the [[American Civil War]]. In this universe, Steve Rogers is a corporal attached to a Northern regiment called the [[Redlegs]], led by Colonel Buck \"Bucky\" Barnes. Rogers\\'s first mission turns out to be an attack on a group of civilians, and he refuses to follow Barnes\\' orders.  Barnes shoots Rogers, but only wounds him after Barnes is attacked by an eagle.  Rogers passes out while trying to escape, and has visions of We-pi-ahk the Eagle-Chief.  Waking, he is greeted by a black man, [[Falcon (comics)|Private Wilson]], who brought him back to an Indian reserve. Wilson believes Steve\\'s vision of We-pi-ahk means he is destined to be the one that will bring union to all people. Wilson begins a mystical ceremony that he says will make Rogers \"as you are on the inside, so shall you become on the outside.\"  Barnes breaks into the hut as the ceremony is underway.  Rogers is mystically given superhuman strength and a magical shield that can transform into an eagle, while Barnes\\' head is turned into a fleshless skull.  Barnes orders his men to open fire and kill everyone in the camp, and Wilson is fatally shot.  Before the troops can escape, Rogers appears as Captain America, and captures Barnes and his men.  Thanks to Captain America\\'s involvement, the Civil War ends earlier than in our history, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] is never assassinated.  Rogers helps the South rebuild after the war, and suppresses the rise of the [[Ku Klux Klan|K.K.K.]] As a representative of the Indian people, he is able to prevent the [[Indian wars]] of 1870. Unfortunately Barnes, now known as the White Skull, forms a group even more dangerous than the K.K.K. The descendants of both men continue fighting each other up to the present in this alternative universe.<ref>\\'\\'What If: Captain America\\'\\' (vol. 1) #1 (Feb 2006)</ref>\\n* In the 2006 \\'\\'What If [[Age of Apocalypse]]\\'\\' one shot, Captain America is the leader of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] (this reality\\'s version of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]), alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] (not bonded with any [[adamantium]]), [[Captain Britain]] (who uses Iron Man\\'s armor), [[Brother Voodoo]] (this reality\\'s [[Sorcerer Supreme]], after [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]\\'s death), [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (who has a prosthetic arm), the [[Molecule Man]], [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], and [[Nate Grey|Nate Summers]].

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time that the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work in factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to a Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]], after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event that he survived the entire experiment. Rogers stopped him from destroying the experiment, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and other soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]].

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry.

But then the psychological pressure began to wear down on him and after an operation for the Phoenix Program he simply disappeared.<ref name=\"UCCA2\"/>\\n\\nRogers, sensing that Carol told him this in order for him to make it look like he went AWOL, subdued Danvers and left to hunt down Frank Simpson. Once in Vietnam, Rogers\\' search for Simpson results in being told about a secret village deep in the Vietnamese forest.

After a lengthy hand-to-hand fight with an argument about morality, Steve was able to emerge victorious over Simpson. Aware of the fact that he was surrounded by gun toting villagers with Super Soldier Serum flowing in their veins, he warns them that if they persisted in aiming to kill him, he will treat them as enemy combatants and show them no mercy. After the surrender of the villagers, a rescue by S.H.I.E.L.D., and some time to recuperate, Steve is seen having a beer with Hawkeye where he tells Hawkeye that he did not know if he would make it out of that jungle alive and it was God that sent him the cobra.  Hawkeye intimates that the Devil is not a possibility.  Feeling the need to put Frank on the right path and to lead him on the right path, Rogers visits Simpson in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] where he is hospitalized under supervision and begins to read the Bible to him.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Jason Aaron | Artist = Ron Garney | Colorist = Jason Keith | Title = Ultimate Comics: Captain America #4 | Date = April 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\n===Ultimate Comics Ultimates===\\nUltimate Cap is largely absent during the series of events initiated by [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]], leading to the destruction of Washington and death of POTUS [[Barack Obama]].<ref>\\'\\'Ultimate Comics Ultimates\\'\\' 01-12</ref> He returns to assist new President Howard during the events of \"Divided they Fall.\" The US is on the brink of civil war as some States decide to leave the Union, and the legitimacy of President Howard is being put into question.<ref>\\'\\'Ultimate Comics Ultimates\\'\\' 13-14</ref>\\n\\nCaptain America takes on the role of being the President of the United States after being made a [[write-in candidate]] in Issue 16 and reunites the warring states of America.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Matt|title=CAPTAIN AMERICA GETS NEW JOB TITLE: US PRESIDENT|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/captain-america-gets-new-job-title-us-president|publisher=AP|access-date=18 September 2012}}</ref>\\n\\n===Return===\\nWhen Maker collaborated with [[High Evolutionary]] to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality, the Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.<ref>\\'\\'Ultimates 2\\'\\' Vol. 2 #9</ref> When [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Earth-616\\'s version of the Ultimates]] arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker about his actions, he ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack.

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time that the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work in factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to a Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]], after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event that he survived the entire experiment. Rogers stopped him from destroying the experiment, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and other soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission, Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time that the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work in factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to a Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]], after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event that he survived the entire experiment. Rogers stopped him from destroying the experiment, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and other soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission, Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Swept up in nationalistic pride, he attempted to join the United States Army in order to serve overseas, but due to his original physical stature he is rejected. He is then inducted into a secret program similar to that of \"Project: Rebirth\". Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment. Danvers reveals that originally, Simpson was overjoyed about serving his country and amassed a high enemy casualty count. But then the psychological pressure began to wear down on him and after an operation for the Phoenix Program he simply disappeared.<ref name=\"UCCA2\"/>\\n\\nRogers, sensing that Carol told him this in order for him to make it look like he went AWOL, subdued Danvers and left to hunt down Frank Simpson. Once in Vietnam, Rogers\\' search for Simpson results in being told about a secret village deep in the Vietnamese forest.  Unfortunately, the source of this news along with the rest of the village has a synthesis of the Super Soldier Serum via Simpson\\'s blood flowing through them and Steve is captured and taken prisoner.<ref name=\"UCCA2\"/>  Day after day he is physically and psychologically tortured and Simpsons attempts to brainwash him with anti-American diatribes.<ref name=\"UCCA3\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Jason Aaron | Artist = Ron Garney | Colorist = Jason Keith, Matt Milla | Title = Ultimate Comics: Captain America #3 | Date = March 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nOne day two S.H.I.E.L.D. employees sent to rescue Steve are captured and later executed because they are mistaken for assassins.

After a lengthy hand-to-hand fight with an argument about morality, Steve was able to emerge victorious over Simpson. Aware of the fact that he was surrounded by gun toting villagers with Super Soldier Serum flowing in their veins, he warns them that if they persisted in aiming to kill him, he will treat them as enemy combatants and show them no mercy. After the surrender of the villagers, a rescue by S.H.I.E.L.D., and some time to recuperate, Steve is seen having a beer with Hawkeye where he tells Hawkeye that he did not know if he would make it out of that jungle alive and it was God that sent him the cobra.  Hawkeye intimates that the Devil is not a possibility.  Feeling the need to put Frank on the right path and to lead him on the right path, Rogers visits Simpson in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] where he is hospitalized under supervision and begins to read the Bible to him.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Jason Aaron | Artist = Ron Garney | Colorist = Jason Keith | Title = Ultimate Comics: Captain America #4 | Date = April 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\n===Ultimate Comics Ultimates===\\nUltimate Cap is largely absent during the series of events initiated by [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]], leading to the destruction of Washington and death of POTUS [[Barack Obama]].<ref>\\'\\'Ultimate Comics Ultimates\\'\\' 01-12</ref> He returns to assist new President Howard during the events of \"Divided they Fall.\" The US is on the brink of civil war as some States decide to leave the Union, and the legitimacy of President Howard is being put into question.<ref>\\'\\'Ultimate Comics Ultimates\\'\\' 13-14</ref>\\n\\nCaptain America takes on the role of being the President of the United States after being made a [[write-in candidate]] in Issue 16 and reunites the warring states of America.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Matt|title=CAPTAIN AMERICA GETS NEW JOB TITLE: US PRESIDENT|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/captain-america-gets-new-job-title-us-president|publisher=AP|access-date=18 September 2012}}</ref>\\n\\n===Return===\\nWhen Maker collaborated with [[High Evolutionary]] to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality, the Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.<ref>\\'\\'Ultimates 2\\'\\' Vol. 2 #9</ref> When [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Earth-616\\'s version of the Ultimates]] arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker about his actions, he ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack.

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time that the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work in factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to a Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]], after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event that he survived the entire experiment. Rogers stopped him from destroying the experiment, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and other soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission, Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time that the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work in factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to a Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]], after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event that he survived the entire experiment. Rogers stopped him from destroying the experiment, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and other soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission, Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time that the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work in factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to a Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]], after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event that he survived the entire experiment. Rogers stopped him from destroying the experiment, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and other soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]].

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]].

However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]].

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest.

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]].

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

He is an alternative version of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

He is an alternative version of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

He is an alternative version of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered  Doctor Erskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates. As the team\\'s deputy leader, Rogers was uncomfortable with the notion of working with a man that he knew so little about. After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.  Fury lied about the origin of T\\'Challa\\'s scars, and about T\\'Challa\\'s history with the Weapon X Program, while also telling him that everything about the \"Black Panther\" was classified.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jeph Loeb]] | Artist = Marko Djurdjevic | Colorist = Marko Djurdjevic | Title = Ultimate Captain America #1 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nCaptain America eventually established a means of communicating with T\\'Challa and learned of the man\\'s desire to return to [[Wakanda]] to see his father.

He is an alternative version of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Swept up in nationalistic pride, he attempted to join the United States Army in order to serve overseas, but due to his original physical stature he is rejected. He is then inducted into a secret program similar to that of \"Project: Rebirth\". Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

He is an alternative version of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\").

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours. And Cap himself in Ultimates volume 1 says he should be able to heal broken bones in about a day or two.\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]===\\nYears after, the body of Captain America was found in the [[Arctic Ocean]] frozen in a block of ice.

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest.

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours. And Cap himself in Ultimates volume 1 says he should be able to heal broken bones in about a day or two.\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]===\\nYears after, the body of Captain America was found in the [[Arctic Ocean]] frozen in a block of ice.

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours. And Cap himself in Ultimates volume 1 says he should be able to heal broken bones in about a day or two.\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]===\\nYears after, the body of Captain America was found in the [[Arctic Ocean]] frozen in a block of ice.

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with Herr Kleiser, who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours. And Cap himself in Ultimates volume 1 says he should be able to heal broken bones in about a day or two.\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]===\\nYears after, the body of Captain America was found in the [[Arctic Ocean]] frozen in a block of ice.

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with [[Herr Kleiser]], who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.

After Steve alarmingly discovered that T\\'Challa\\'s throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.

The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with [[Herr Kleiser]], who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours. And Cap himself in Ultimates volume 1 says he should be able to heal broken bones in about a day or two.\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]===\\nYears after, the body of Captain America was found in the [[Arctic Ocean]] frozen in a block of ice.

A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest.

Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of [[Captain America]] that appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of books. The character first appeared in \\'\\'[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]\\'\\' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nSteve Rogers grew up in [[Brooklyn]] during the [[Great Depression]], a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|\"Bucky\" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the [[Nazis]] in [[Europe]], Rogers was inspired to enlist in the [[U.S. Army|Army]] around the time the [[United States]] entered [[World War II]]. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when [[Dum Dum Dugan|Military Sergeant Dugan]] recruited him for [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]] after hearing Rogers\\' pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by [[Abraham Erskine|Doctor Erskine]], Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart [[Gail Richards]], becoming \\'\\'\\'Captain America\\'\\'\\'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\\n\\nFor the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James \"Lucky Jim\" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]\\'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed \"Siegsoldat\" (\"Victory soldier\"). The experiment\\'s dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with [[Herr Kleiser]], who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House.

Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America\\'s physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.\\n\\nCaptain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth\\'s, in \"Blade vs the Ultimates\" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours.

Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the \"Marauders\" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola\\'s AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the \"Marauders\" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola\\'s AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the \"Marauders\" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder\\'s camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola\\'s new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\\n\\n===[[The Ultimates 3]]===\\nBefore the events of the Liberators\\' attack, Steve befriended [[T\\'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates.
