    "In this notebook, we will explore the temporal development of Marvel- and DC-Comics. We have used the Wikipedia Revisions api to scrape the Wikipedia pages of 2303 superheroes since the dawn of Wikipedia. We have used these pages to create a directed, temporal graph object that will allow us to understand the development of revisions.\n",

    "We have also webscraped meta data from lists of female, black, latino, and asian superheroes and villains. With this meta data we were able to appoint node attributes to our graph with the help of document similarity (since different websites may call superheroes by different versions of their names).\n",
