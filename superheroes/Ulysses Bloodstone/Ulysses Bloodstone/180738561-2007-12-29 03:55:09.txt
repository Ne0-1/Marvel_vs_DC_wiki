'''Ulysses Bloodstone''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[Immortality|immortal]] monster-hunter in the [[Marvel universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
In the [[Hyborian Age]], a [[meteorite]] landed on [[Earth]] in Northern Vanaheim on the European continent, circa 8250 B.C. It was controlled by an entity called the Hellfire Helix, who wanted to take over the world. To that end, it sent its agent, Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn, to get the meteorite and find a host for it. However, a local human hunter/gatherer found the rock, and fought Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn. In the fight, the meteor was smashed, a part of it (also called the Bloodgem) was imbedded in the human's chest, and the explosion killed the human's tribe. The human vowed revenge on Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn. Because of the gem in his chest, he became immortal, and later became known as Ulysses Bloodstone.

Ulysses Bloodstone was one of the greatest mercenaries in the world. His long life allowed him to assemble a vast fortune, which he used to set up a series of outposts, fully staffed and equipped, in various corners of the world. He gained mastery of most of the world's weaponry, and a large portion of the world's martial arts and languages. 

Over the next 10,000 years, Bloodstone would travel all over the world, looking for Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn. As a result, by the 20th century he had become immensely wealthy, and could speak most of the world's languages. In his hunt for Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn, he had become a mercenary, adventurer, and solider of fortune, proficient with most of the world's weaponry. Because of Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn's ability to summon monsters, Bloodstone gained a reputation as a [[monster]] hunter.

Bloodstone met two of his future allies Brad Carter and P.D.Q. Warner who seeking giant humanoid monsters to battle.<ref>''Marvel Presents'' #1-2</ref> He battled the giant undersea humanoid monster [[Goram (comics)|Goram]] while seeking another Bloodstone fragment.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #1</ref> Goram was subdued by the technology of Bloodstone Island, and then Ulysses Bloodstone fought [[Killer Shrike]].<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #2</ref> Bloodstone met [[Iron Man]], then battled Goram and his master [[Centurius]].<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #3</ref> Bloodstone then met Ullux'l Kwan Tae Syn on the astral plane.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #4</ref>  Bloodstone petitioned the United Nations to recognize the sovereignty of Bloodstone Island, and then battled Sharzan the Elemental.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #6</ref>

Bloodstone's vendetta against the Hellfire Helix ended when the truth came out: the Hellfire Helix had needed a host, and had chosen Bloodstone. As Bloodstone and Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn had fought, the Helix had assembled a group called "[[Conspiracy (comics)|The Conspiracy]]" to reassemble the meteor and gain control of Bloodstone. Bloodstone battled the Conspiracy, but they defeated him. The life-sustaining gem fragment was surgically removed from his chest by Conspiracy member Dr. Juden Bardham.  The Conspiracy thought they would become immortal, but the Helix killed them to reassemble the gem. Bloodstone's body managed to kill the gem-monster Ullux’l Kwan Tae Syn and prevent the Helix from coming to Earth by vanquishing the Hellfire Helix on the astral plane.  His body then withered and died.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #8</ref>

Bloodstone's skeleton was later revealed to be in the possession of the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>''Captain America'' #357</ref> The Hellfire Helix was later revealed to have survived, and possessed the corpse of the first [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]], which disappeared down an inactive volcano in Japan.<ref>''Captain America'' #362</ref>

==Other Versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate future of [[Earth X]], in the afterlife Ulysses joins with dozens of other deceased heroes in attempt to stop the genocidal plans of [[Mephisto]] and [[Thanos]].

==Powers and abilities==
The mystic Bloodstone fragment imbedded in Bloodstone's chest emanates magical energy which increases his physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses to superhuman levels.  The Bloodstone also provides vast regenerative capabilities that enable him to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. The more extensive the injury, the longer it takes for him to fully heal. Bloodstone's healing ability is sufficiently developed to regrow severed limbs, which he has done at least once. On this occasion, Bloodstone enters a state of self-induced hibernation which lasts about 10 years. Aside from his greatly enhanced healing, the Bloodgem renders Bloodstone virtually immortal in the sense that he is immune to the effects of aging and to all known diseases. Bloodstone's life is dependent upon the presence of the fragment. As a result, Bloodstone doesn't require food, water, or air to survive. However, if he is forcefully separated from the gem, he will die. 

Aside from his physical attributes, the Bloodstone provides him certain [[psionic]] abilities. He possesses a kind of invisible third eye on his forehead that allows him to see human auras, which allows him to see people even in total darkness, and the ability to travel onto the [[astral plane]]. Bloodstone also possesses some degree of telekinesis, the limits of which aren't known. He also has the ability to psychokinetically detonate certain explosives.

Bloodstone's greatly extended lifespan has afforded him many lifetimes' worth of time to study virtually anything he wishes to learn. Thus, he has a high degree in expertise in virtually all forms of armed and unarmed combat. In the modern area, he uses a variety of different weapons including high caliber firearms, swords, and knives. He carries a specially-designed sawed-off shotgun whose shells he could detonate mentally, as well as a stainless steel Bowie knife and .45 caliber handguns. He wears a flak jacket with storage pouches for a variety of weapons and ammunition.

==Elsa Bloodstone==
{{main|Elsa Bloodstone}}
The daughter of Ulysses, Elsa was the star of her own mini-series, simply titled ''Bloodstone''. In ''[[Nextwave]]'' #1, the character of Elsa Bloodstone had since joined a team of super-powered heroes. She says she comes from 'a line of near-immortal monster hunters', and has a red gem on a choker collar. She is super-strong and capable of surviving car crashes. She is also British.
