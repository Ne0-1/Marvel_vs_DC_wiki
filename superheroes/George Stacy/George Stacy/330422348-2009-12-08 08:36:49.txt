'''George Stacy''' is a [[supporting character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Spider-Man]] series. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (vol. 1) #56 (1968), and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[John Romita, Sr.]], and [[Don Heck]]. He is [[Gwen Stacy]]'s father and he strongly approves of his daughter's relationship with Peter Parker (Spider-Man). He is also a strong supporter of Spider-Man, often defending him when others accuses him.

During a fight between Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus]], he is crushed by falling debris while saving a child, in the classic ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 1) #90 (Nov. 1970).  As he dies, he reveals to Peter that he had known his identity for some time (something Peter had suspected anyway), and asks Peter to take care of Gwen.  In the film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), he is played by [[James Cromwell]] and is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.

==Fictional character history==
Little did [[Peter Parker]] know, after falling in love with Empire State University classmate [[Gwen Stacy]], that her father was one of the most respected former police officers in the [[NYPD]], Captain George Stacy. But even in retirement, Captain Stacy kept up with the happenings at the department - and had taken a keen interest in Spider-Man. 
It wasn't long before [[John Jameson]] called Captain Stacy out of retirement to assist in the return of a device called the Nullifier - which could render any electrical or mechanical apparatus inoperative - that [[Doctor Octopus]] had tricked an amnesiac Spider-Man into stealing<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #56</ref>. 

After safely securing the weapon, Captain Stacy interviewed Peter Parker, believed to have been held captive with Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man. After the interview, Captain Stacy revealed to Peter that he had spent time studying the career of Spider-Man, and that he was glad to have met Peter, known for photographing the wall-crawler on numerous occasions. 

Identifying himself as a strong supporter of Spider-Man, Captain Stacy wished to see the wall-crawler redeemed in the public eye. He also took an instant liking to Peter, and openly encouraged the growing bond between the youngster and his daughter, Gwen. Shortly thereafter at a dance club which employed [[Mary Jane Watson]], Captain Stacy was put under a hypnotic trance through a rigged camera operated by Mary Jane who took photos of him unaware that her actions were aiding the Kingpin of Crime, [[Wilson Fisk]]. Stacy was compelled into a backroom where he underwent additional brainwashing by the camera's inventor, Dr. Winkler. Despite Spider-Man's efforts, George returned programmed to follow the Kingpin's directions. As such, Captain Stacy later stole police records for the Kingpin while Spider-Man's automatic camera captured the theft. Peter Parker gave the photos to J. Jonah Jameson, hopeful that this apparent betrayal of the Stacy family would actually help expedite a discovery of the captain's innocence. While George and Gwen attempted to flee, they were kidnapped by the Kingpin's men and held captive at one of Norman Osborn's labs where Dr. Winkler worked. The Kingpin intended to eliminate the Stacys once they were used to lure Spider-Man into his crushing hands. While Spider-Man battled the Kingpin, Osborn arrived and tackled on the Kingpin's henchmen holding the Stacy's at gunpoint. Though the Kingpin fled, and Winkler was apparently killed, the Stacy's were rescued. Osborn's testimony to the police exonerated Captain Stacy<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #59-61</ref>. 

Captain Stacy started to suspect the two were one. After a feverish Peter admitted to being Spider-Man before his friends including Captain Stacy, Parker asking the Prowler to imitate Spider-Man so Peter and the web-slinger could be seen together<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #87</ref>. Captain Stacy could not be fooled. Called into action one night, Captain Stacy watched Spider-Man battle [[Doctor Octopus]] on a rooftop high above the city. A crowd had gathered nearby to watch the confrontation. As the two fought fiercely, chunks of concrete began to dislodge from the roof and rain on the spectators below. Spotting a child standing under the falling masonry, Captain Stacy leapt to cover the boy - and paid for his act of heroism with his own life. Abandoning the fight, Spider-Man swung down in time to hear Captain Stacy's final words, "Be good to her, son! Be good to her. She loves you so very much.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #90</ref><ref>http://marvel.com/universe/Stacy%2C_George</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate George Stacy===
In the Ultimate universe, this version of George is known as '''Capt. John Stacy''' and is  much younger than his mainstream counterpart as he does not have white hair, but brown hair. He is also much athletic and carries his own gun. In this version he is not a fan of Spider-Man, but admired his vigilante work. He has trouble handling his teenage daughter, Gwen, and his marriage problems.

He made an appearance in issue 5, arriving at the warehouse where the killer of Ben Parker is hiding out when Spider-Man catches up to him.  He then makes his full debut in issue 15, when he was investigating a house being attacked, which was the work of Doctor Octopus, and heard that his daughter caused trouble by bringing a knife. He has been contacted by Daily Bugle reporter, Ben Urich, about his investigations.

He was killed by the Ultimate version of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], dressed up as Spider-Man (during the "Public Scrutiny" arc), when he robbed an armored truck and threw a bag with a bomb in it on to a near by child, sacrificing his own life to save the boy (exactly the same way his 616 counterpart died).

His death caused a stricken Gwen to have develop a deep hatred for Spider-Man, even when the man who killed her father confessed for his crimes. This eventually lead for Gwen to have been offered by May and Peter to live with them.

===Marvel Adventures Spider-Man===
George Stacy was hinted from Emma Frost from issue 53 by the arrival of his daughter, Gwen, who is a new student of Midtown High. In issue 54, George made his full debut as a slightly younger character with light brown hair. He recently discovered that Peter is Spider-Man when he accidentally yelled a quote that George knows. With his identity now known, George now calls him requesting support on some of his cases, which he later feels he shouldn't use Peter, but Peter instead allowed George to call him if he needs help, pleasing George.

==In other media==
===Television===
====''The Spectacular Spider-Man''====
[[File:The Spectacular Spider-Man 2x04. Shear Strength 016 0001.jpg|thumb|left|George Stacy in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.]]
In ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', George Stacy is voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]. A police captain and father of Gwen Stacy, he often sees Spider-Man in action, or the results of his work, and thus truly believes him to be a hero, albeit one operating outside of the law. This version of George is based on both his mainstream counterpart and his Ultimate counterpart as he has both his admiration and respect for Spider-Man, like his mainstream counterpart, and is younger and athletic and good with firearms, like his Ultimate counterpart.  

When the Chameleon tried to frame Spider-Man by committing crimes while disguised as the webswinger in "Persona", Stacy defended him, pointing out that the robber Spider-Man was taller than the real Spider-Man.  Stacy also warned Spider-Man that as long as he wore a mask, people would wonder.  In "Group Therapy," Stacy was caught in a disbelief when he saw Spider-Man nearly beaten Doctor Octopus to death under the influence of the alien symbiote.  He later joins the Parkers with Gwen for Thanksgiving, thankful that his daughter was saved by Spider-Man.

Captain Stacy is later forced by Doctor Octopus (posing as the Master Planner) to steal secret codes from Homeland Security when the villain kidnaps Gwen. Spider-Man saves his daughter, and later, Stacy joins Midtown High School as an instructor for a criminal justice class in order to get close to his daughter (or rather, to keep a closer eye on her).
 
When both Venom and Chameleon impersonated Spider-Man, George Stacy was unconvinced either was the genuine article.  And he was able to back up the second claim by noting the distinct differences between the black-suit Spider-Man and Venom.
 
Venom attempts to out Spider-Man's secret identity, but Ned Lee 'proves' it can't be true. While everyone else agrees and moves on, Stacy has a private conversation with Peter about Spider-Man's need to keep his identity a secret. It is strongly hinted that he knows the truth and gives his approval in his own way. He often speaks in innuendo and encrypted dialogue to both Parker and Spider-Man that aids him in his endeavors, and provides covers and alibis to aid Peter in slipping away from school activities to do his superhero work.

===Film===
====''Spider-Man 3''====
George Stacy is portrayed by [[James Cromwell]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. George is still Gwen's father and is a Captain in the New York City Police Department. Like his mainstream counterpart, he too is an admirer of Spider-Man.

While an incident involving the Sandman is occurring downtown, he met photographer [[Eddie Brock]], who he reveals is dating his daughter, when his daughter fell from the building, George was relieved when Spider-Man saved her.

George witnessed [[Harry Osborn]]'s funeral.

====''Spider-Man 4''====
James Cromwell is set to reprise his role in the upcoming fourth movie.
