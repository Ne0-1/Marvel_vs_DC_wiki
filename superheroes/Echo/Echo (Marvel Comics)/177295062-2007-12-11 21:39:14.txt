'''Echo''', also known as '''[[Ronin (comics)|Ronin]]''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] superheroine and a supporting character of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. She debuted in ''Daredevil'' Vol. 2, #9 (Dec. 1999), and was created by [[David W. Mack|David Mack]] and [[Joe Quesada]]. She is a [[Latino|Hispanic]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and one of the very few [[deaf]] comic characters.

When she dons her "Echo" guise, she is easily recognizable by a white hand stain which covers most of her face.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:mayalopez1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Maya Lopez. Art by David Mack.]]

When she was a small girl, '''Maya Lopez''''s father was killed by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. As he died, he left a bloody handprint on Maya's face. 

The last wish of Maya's father before dying was that Fisk raise the child well: a wish the Kingpin honored, caring for her as his own.

Believed to be mentally-disabled, Maya was sent to an expensive school for people with learning disabilities. There, she managed to completely replicate a song on the piano. After that, she was sent to another expensive school&mdash;for prodigies. She would soon become a gifted woman.

One day, upon visiting her father's grave with Fisk, she asked how he died. Fisk told her that Daredevil had killed him.

===Echo===
Maya was sent by the Kingpin to Matt Murdock to prove Matt's weakness. He told her that Matt believed he was a bad person, and that she was the only way to prove him wrong. (As Maya believed him, it would not appear to be a lie when she told Matt.)

Matt Murdock and Maya soon fell in love. She later took on the guise of Echo, hunting Daredevil down. On her face she painted a white handprint, similar to how her father left his dying handprint on her when she was young. Having watched videos of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and Daredevil fighting, she proved more than a match for Daredevil. She took him down and nearly killed him, refusing only when she found out Matt and Daredevil were one and the same. Matt managed to correct the Kingpin's lies. In revenge, Maya confronted Fisk and shot him in the face, blinding him and starting the chain of events that would lead to his eventual downfall. (Kingpin would later partially recover his eyesight through reconstructive eye surgery.)

After realizing the horror of her actions and the lies she has grown up with, Maya fled the United States to do some soul-searching. When she came back, she tried reuniting with Matt Murdock, only to find out he was now with a blind woman named [[Milla Donovan]], and that the Kingpin was still alive (despite Maya's attempts to kill him). Leaving Matt, Maya visited the Kingpin in prison, who told her that he didn't blame her for what she did, and that despite all that had happened, he still loved her like a daughter.

Unsatisfied and still needing peace, Maya turned to ''the Chief'', her father's old friend, noted for his wisdom. The Chief sent Maya on a ''Vision Quest'' to calm her soul. On her quest, she met and befriended [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] who helped her recover and passed on his knowledge of Japanese culture and Japanese organized crime. Soon enough, Echo made peace with her past and was back doing performance art.

===Ronin and the Avengers===
[[Image:Roninecho.png|thumb|Echo as Ronin.]]Recently, after being unable to join the [[New Avengers]] due to his refusal to tarnish the reputations of heroes such as [[Captain America]] by working with him, Daredevil recommended Maya to Captain America to aid the Avengers in seizing the [[Silver Samurai]] in [[Japan]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #11</ref> She donned a suit that conceals her identity as well as her gender and rechristened herself as ''Ronin''. The word is Japanese for 'Masterless Samurai'. 

After joining the Avengers, Maya returned to Japan to keep an eye on [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], a dangerous assassin rumored to be leading the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], check on the Silver Samurai from time to time, and hopefully solve the conflict between The Hand and Clan Yashida. As Ronin, around the conclusion of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] between the pro- and anti-registration factions in America, Maya fought Elektra and was killed, but was soon resurrected by the Hand with the same process used to raise Elektra. They took Maya captive with the intent of turning her into an assassin for The Hand. [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and the new [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]] rescue her and escape, leaving a furious Elektra to send the Hand after them. During a brief lull in the fight with the Hand, where Luke Cage tried to negotiate with Elektra to buy time, it was revealed that the Hand had been successful in brainwashing Maya, as she subsequently stabbed Dr. Strange with a sword given to her by one of the Hand<ref>''New Avengers'' #30</ref>. She continues to fight the New Avengers until Dr. Strange is able to release his Astral Form, with [[Wong (comics)|Wong]]'s help, and frees Maya from the brainwashing. Maya then charges straight for Elektra, who is fighting Luke Cage, and brutally stabs and slices her with a sword. It is revealed afterwards that Elektra is a Skrull warrior in disguise.<ref>''New Avengers'' #31</ref>. Having returned to New York (And after Spider-Woman's apparent betrayal of them when she steals the corpse of the Skrull Elektra)<ref>''New Avengers'' #32</ref>, the Avengers hide in a hotel room, (Strange's magic making it appear that Echo is the only person in the room) before returning to Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, Echo officially handing the Ronin identity over to Clint Barton after they arrive<ref>''New Avengers'' #33</ref>. After Strange confirms their identities by casting a spell that shows everyone their true nature- Echo appearing dressed in a female variation of Daredevil's costume- the team head to Stark Tower to stop the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s attack on the building, only to encounter the Mighty Avengers locked in battle with an army of invading [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]], one of which latches on to Echo<ref>''New Avengers'' #34</ref>. 

===World War Hulk===
In ''[[World War Hulk]]'', Echo attempts to defend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] from Hiroim and [[Elloe Kaifi (comics)|Elloe]] of the Hulk's Warbound during their attack on the Sanctum Sanctorum to capture Doctor Strange. She, along with Iron Fist and Ronin, is defeated and captured<ref>''World War Hulk'' #3</ref>.

===The Initiative===
Maya is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''. Her alliance with the New Avengers may make such recruitment extremely unlikely.

==Powers and abilities==
Maya Lopez is an Olympic-level athlete possessing "[[Photographic_reflexes|photographic reflexes]]" or the uncanny ability to perfectly copy other people's movements, similar to the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s photographic reflexes. Just by watching other people, she has become a concert-level pianist, a dangerous boxer, and a gifted ballerina (and on one occasion even piloted a Quinjet for a few minutes). Aside from those, she has also gained Bullseye's uncanny aim and Daredevil's acrobatic abilities after watching tapes of their fights.

Although with great potential, deafness gives Maya Lopez great drawbacks. Her absolute reliance on visual cues renders her helpless in the dark, and her ability to communicate by reading lips prevents her from taking oral commands and communicating with people who are wearing masks or are not in direct visual contact; when she initially met the Avengers, Captain America had to repeat all of Iron Man's questions for her.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=August 2007}}
*The character of Echo as presented in ''Parts of a Hole'' is very similar to that of [[Elektra (comics)| Elektra]] from the Daredevil [[Daredevil (film)| film]], particularly in the belief that Matt Murdock killed their fathers. Some fans believe that she may have been an inspiration but the film's writers have not officially commented. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

*The identity of Ronin was an attempt by ''New Avengers'' writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to create a mystery after the apparently-male character was depicted on several comic book covers, including issues of ''New Avengers'', and one  ''[[Pulse (comics)| Pulse]]'' issue. Fan speculation was high, with the most common guess that Ronin was Daredevil (despite Bendis denying that this was the case). However, ''Avengers: The Ultimate Guide'', a [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Press]] book, revealed Ronin to be Echo weeks before the release of ''New Avengers'' #13, where Ronin's true identity was belatedly revealed. This was due to the chronic lateness of ''New Avengers,'' which plagued the title until the ''Civil War'' crossover issues. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

*Though Maya had the white "hand" marking on her face when she first revealed her identity it has not been used since.

*Maia and Elektra are both stars in the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]].
