'''Echo''', also known as '''Ronin''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] superheroine and a supporting character of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. She debuted in ''Daredevil'' Vol. 2, #9 (Dec. 1999), and was created by [[David Mack]] and [[Joe Quesada]]. She is a [[Latino|Latina]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and one of the very few [[deaf]] comic characters.

When she dons her "Echo" guise, she is easily recognizable by a white hand stain which covers most of her face.

==Character history==
[[Image:mayalopez2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Maya Lopez. Art by David Mack.]]

When she was a small girl, '''Maya Lopez''''s father was killed by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. The last wish of her father before dying was that Fisk raise the child well: a wish the Kingpin honored, caring for her as if she was his own.

Believed to be mentally-disabled, Maya was sent to an expensive school for people with learning disabilities. There, she managed to completely replicate a song on the piano. After that, she was sent to another expensive school--for prodigies. She would soon become a gifted woman.

One day, upon visiting her father's grave with Fisk, she asked how he died. Fisk told her that Daredevil had killed him.

===Echo===
Maya was sent by the Kingpin to Matt Murdock to prove Matt's weakness. He told her that Matt believed he was a bad person, and that she was the only way to prove him wrong. (As Maya believed him, it would not appear to be a lie when she told Matt.)

Matt Murdock and Maya soon fell in love. She later took on the guise of Echo, hunting Daredevil down. Having watched videos of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and Daredevil fighting, she proved more than a match for Daredevil. She took him down and nearly killed him, refusing only when she found out Matt and Daredevil were one and the same. Matt managed to correct the Kingpin's lies. In revenge, Maya confronted Fisk and shot him in the face, blinding him and starting the chain of events that would lead to his eventual downfall. (Kingpin would later partially recover his eyesight through reconstructive eye surgery.)

Art by [[David Mack]].]]After realizing the horror of her actions and the lies she has grown up with, Maya fled the United States to do some soul-searching. When she came back, she tried reuniting with Matt Murdock, only to find out he was now with a blind woman named [[Milla Donovan]], and that the Kingpin was still alive (despite Maya's attempts to kill him). Leaving Matt, Maya visited the Kingpin in prison, who told her that he didn't blame her for what she did, and that despite all that had happened, he still loved her like a daughter.

Unsatisfied and still needing peace, Maya turned to ''the Chief'', her father's old friend, noted for his wisdom. The Chief sent Maya on a ''Vision Quest'' to calm her soul. On her quest, she met and befriended [[Wolverine_(comics)|Wolverine]] who helped her recover and may be attributed to her picking up Japanese values and knowledge of the Japanese underworld. Soon enough, Echo made peace with her past and was back doing performance art.

===Ronin===
[[Image:mayalopez1.jpg|thumb|Maya Lopez. Art by [[David Mack]].]]Recently, after being unable to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for personal reasons, Daredevil recommended Maya to Captain America to aid the Avengers in seizing the [[Silver Samurai]] in [[Japan]]. She donned a suit that conceals her identity as well as her gender and rechristened herself as ''Ronin''.

After joining the Avengers, Maya shortly returned to Japan to keep an eye on [[Elektra_(comics)|Elektra Natchios]], a dangerous assassin rumoured to be leading the [[Hand_(comics)|Hand]], check on the Silver Samurai from time to time, and hopefully solve the conflict between The Hand and Clan Yashida.

==Powers and abilities==
Maya Lopez is an olympic-level athlete possessing [[List of comic book superpowers#Photographic Reflexes|photographic reflexes]] or the uncanny ability to perfectly copy other people's movements, similar to the [[Taskmaster]]'s. Just by watching other people, she has become a concert-level pianist, a dangerous boxer, and a gifted ballerina (and on one occasion even piloted a Quinjet for a few minutes). Aside from those, she has also gained Bullseye's uncanny aim and Daredevil's acrobatic abilities after watching tapes of their fights.

[[Image:NEWAVN011 cov.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to ''New Avengers'' #11, featuring Echo in her "Ronin" guise. Art by David Finch.]]Although with great potentials, deafness gives Maya Lopez great drawbacks: her absolute reliance on visual cues renders her helpless in the dark, and her ability to communicate by reading lips prevents her from taking oral commands and communicating with people who are wearing masks or are not in direct visual contact.

==Trivia==
*The character of Echo as presented in ''Parts of a Hole'' is very similar to that of [[Elektra (comics)| Elektra]] from the [[Daredevil (film)| movie]], particularly in the belief that Matt Murdock killed their fathers. Some fans believe that she may have been an inspiration but the film's writers have not officially commented.

*The identity of Ronin was an attempt by ''New Avengers'' writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to create a mystery after the apparently-male character was depicted on several comicbook covers, including issues of ''New Avengers'', and one  ''[[Pulse (comics)| Pulse]]'' issue. Fan speculation was high, with the most common guess that Ronin was Daredevil (despite Bendis denying that this was the case). However, ''Avengers: The Ultimate Guide'', a [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Press]] book, revealed Ronin to be Echo weeks before ''New Avengers'' #13 -- where Ronin's true identity was belatedly revealed -- was released. This is most likely due to a mixup in publishing schedules, with the ''New Avengers'' issue being released weeks later than originally announced.

*In Japanese, "[[ronin]]" refers to a masterless [[samurai]], a lone warrior.

==Appearances in other media==

===Video games===
*Ronin appears as a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] exclusive playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
