'''Fire''' is a [[fictional]] [[superheroine]] ppublished by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Super Friends]]'' #25, (October 1979), and was created by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and [[Ramona Fradon]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Global Guardians===
[[Image:GreenFury.jpg|left|thumb|110px|Beatriz as the Green Fury]]
'''Beatriz Bonilla da Costa''' had originally been bequeathed with her powers due to Brazilian mysticism and was the President of Wayne Enterprises' Brazilian Branch. After the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', her history was altered so that she had followed an unusual career path, starting as an amateur model on the beaches of Rio, then becoming a showgirl and stage performer before finding herself serving as an undercover secret agent for the Brazilian government. In the course of one of her missions, she was exposed to the accident which granted her super-human powers, prompting her to assume the identity of the '''Green Fury''' and join the international superhero team the [[Global Guardians]].

===Justice League===
[[Image:FireandIce.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Green Flame and Icemaiden]]
Shortly after changing her name to the '''Green Flame''', the Guardians' UN funding was withdrawn in the wake of the formation the [[Justice League|Justice League International]]. Miss da Costa talked her teammate and friend Icemaiden into joining her in approaching the JLI embassy and asking for a job and remarkably, in the wake of [[Black Canary]]'s resignation and the abduction of several members, the short-handed JLI took them on. Eventually, she once again changed her heroic name, this time to "Fire" in affinity with Icemaiden's shortening of her name to simply [[Ice (comics)|Ice]].

She served the longest continuous term of any JLI member, including an extended period of depowerment after an encounter with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], a period which sadly coincided with the death of her best friend, Ice, at the hands of the [[Overmaster]].

She subsequently returned to Brazil, and attempted to establish herself as the country's main superhero. This met with variable success, which she blamed partly on the [[Martian Manhunter]]'s visibility in the Southern hemisphere (as seen in ''Martian Manhunter'' #10).

===Super Buddies===
According to the series ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'', Fire had retired from super-heroing to establish a career as an internet glamour girl when [[Maxwell Lord]] talked her and several other former JLI members into reforming as a group of "heroes for the common man" called the "[[Super Buddies]]". She found herself apartment-sharing with [[Mary Marvel]] and, in a characterization reminiscent of her former interactions with Ice, forced herself into the reluctant role of "babysitter" for the woefully naive teenager. 

Subsequent publications have partly called into question whether or not the "Super Buddies" still count as official continuity, though Fire and Mary Marvel have been shown to continue to interact. When attempting to rescue [[Ice (comics)|Ice]]'s spirit from Hell (or a dimension similar to it), Fire accidentally looked back, causing the spirit to vanish. During the Super Buddies' time in Hell, [[Etrigan]] the Demon suggested that it was Fire who was fated to die instead of Ice.

===OMAC Project===
As depicted in [[The OMAC Project]] #4, it seems that after the dissolution of the [[Super Buddies]] Fire had returned to her work as detective and secret agent. In that role she helped [[Booster Gold]] and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] to find the connection between [[Maxwell Lord]] and [[Blue Beetle]]'s death. She then took part in an assault by her former teammates from [[JLA|Justice League International]] and the [[Super Buddies]] against a group of [[OMACs]]. Badly wounded, she was saved by the sacrifice of [[Rocket Red]].

[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] and [[Booster Gold]] took her to a hospital. After recovering, Fire appears in ''[[OMAC Project|The OMAC Project Special]]'' as an agent of [[Amanda Waller]]. 

===Checkmate===
{{spoiler}}
[[One Year Later]], she has become the Black King's Knight in the new ongoing [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] series. In the first issue of the series, Fire displays a notable change in her character as she is now depicted as a sanctioned [[Black op|Black Ops]] [[Espionage|Intelligence Agent]]. In the ''OMAC Project Special'' [[Amanda Waller]] implies that not only did Beatriz serve an operative for the [[Brazilian Intelligence Agency]], but that she actually enjoyed the violence that was a part of her job. ''Checkmate'' #2, however, indicates that Fire, while she will follow orders to kill, regrets taking part in a Checkmate mission in which as many as 50 Kobra personnel were killed, many immolated by Fire herself.

Fire has also appeared in the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' maxi-series, chronicling the year's events prior to the One Year Later arc. In issue No. 4, she is shown criticizing Booster Gold for his continued self-promotion while the search continues for the missing superheroes. It has not yet been established what, if any, association Fire has with Checkmate at this point.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:FirePower.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Fire blasts green flames.]]
*Originally Beatriz's only power, gained from a saturation by an organic energy source called '''''Pyroplasm''''', was the ability to breathe a jet of green flame from her mouth (this accident also permanently dyed her hair green as well). 
*During the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' cross-over event, the alien [[Dominators]] set off a "metagene bomb" in the upper atmosphere which affected all super-powered DC characters and, after a period of illness, Fire found her powers greatly magnified as an after-effect. The "new" Fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green flame, in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts, similar to the [[Human Torch]]. Unfortunately, it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers, and she often "flamed on" involuntarily when stressed or angry (and sometimes still does), a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts.
*Beatriz is also a skilled investigator and espionage agent.
*She has some resistance to mind control due to the fact that, as a native speaker of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], her mind is resistant to instructions given in English. 
*She is shown to have a marketable fashion sense having at times worked as a [[fashion designer]]. 

==Trivia==
*Her first canonical appearance was in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' #32 (November 1986).

==Other media==
[[Image:FireMovie.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Michelle Hurd as Fire.]]
*Fire appeared in the ''Justice League of America'' television pilot movie. She was played by [[Michelle Hurd]].
*Fire and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] both made several appearances in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[animated series]], although only Fire had any dialogue. Fire's costume in "normal" mode was a vaguely armoured tank top and pants, while she sported light-green hair and a distinct Latino appearance. In "Fire" mode, however, her facial features change drastically along with the rest of her appearance: green luminous hair and skin, with flame-like entities covering her private parts. Fire seemed to be a distinct novice within the League, given her nervousness about contradicting senior members. Although both women were used primarily in group shots, Fire had several action sequences; her first battle was during ''The Return'', where she temporarily got the better of the android [[Amazo]] until he 'learned' her powers and casually swatted her away. She was rescued by the [[Red Tornado (android)|Red Tornado]].
[[Image:FireJLU.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Fire on ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]
*Fire and [[Wally West|Flash]] engaged in a relationship of mutual flirting (although Flash was unusually shy about her). Although she was uncredited for the role, the distinctive voice made it clear that actress [[Maria Canals]] (Hawkgirl) provided Fire's voice for all her appearances.
*In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode ''Grudge Match'', Fire appeared as a member of a female-only fight club. [[Black Canary]] and Fire, both under mind control, were pitted against one another in one of [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette's]] organized cage matches. Black Canary won the fight and Fire was seriously injured. She was seen again at the end of the episode being helped out of the building by other League members after Roulette was defeated. Fire has one speaking line in the episode.
*In the final episode of ''Justice League Unlimited'', Fire appeared in Ice's swimming pool, and they both fly away together to battle the [[Parademon|Parademon invasion]] of Earth.
