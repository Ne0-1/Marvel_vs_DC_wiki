'''Fire''' (real name Beatriz daCosta) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superheroine]] from [[Brazil]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Her first appearance was in ''DC Comics Presents'' #46 in 1982.

==Character biography==
Beatriz daCosta has followed an unusual career path, starting as an amateur model on the beaches of Rio, then becoming a showgirl and stage performer before finding herself serving as an undercover secret agent for the Brazilian government. In the course of one of her missions, she was exposed to the accident which granted her super-human powers, prompting her to assume the identity of the Green Fury and join the international superhero team the [[Global Guardians]].  Shortly after changing her name to the Green Flame, the Guardians' UN funding was withdrawn in the wake of the formation the [[Justice League| Justice League International]]. Miss daCosta talked her teammate and friend Icemaiden into joining her in approaching the JLI embassy and asking for a job and remarkably, in the wake of [[Black Canary]]'s resignation and the abduction of several members, the short-handed JLI took them on. Eventually, she once again changed her heroic name, this time to "Fire" in affinity with Icemaiden's shortening of her name to simply [[Ice (comics)|Ice]].

She served the longest continuous term of any JLI member, including an extended period of depowerment after an encounter with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], a period which sadly coincided with the death of her best friend, Ice, at the hands of the [[Overmaster]].

==Powers & Abilities==
Originally Beatriz's only power, gained from a saturation by the organic energy source Pyroplasm, was the ability to breathe a jet of green flame from her mouth (this accident also permanently dyed her hair green as well). The fact that this wasn't terribly spectacular (the flame wasn't even a foot long) when compared to the abilities of other Justice Leaguers, especially when contrasted against Fire's bold and aggressive personaity, was a minor running gag in early JLI stories. However the character proved popular and eventually earned an upgrade; during the [[Invasion (comics)| Invasion]] cross-over event, the alien [[Dominators (comics)|Dominators]] set off a "metagene bomb" in the upper atmosphere which affected all super-powered DC characters and, after a period of illness, Fire found her powers considerably enhanced as an aftereffect. The "new" Fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green flame, in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts. Unfortunately, it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers, and she often "flamed on" involuntarily when stressed or angry (and sometimes still does), a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts.

Beatriz is also a skilled investigator and something of a natural seductress (or at least she's aware that her physical appearance grants her some degree of easy influence over others). Somewhat less frequently, she is shown to have a marketable fashion sense (having at times worked as a designer) and to have some resistence to mind control due to the fact that, as a native speaker of Portuguese, her mind is resistent to instructions given in English.

==Recent Events==
According to the series ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'', Fire had retired from super-heroing to establish a career as an internet glamour girl when [[Maxwell Lord]] talked her and several other former JLI members into reforming as a group of "heroes for the common man" called the "[[Super Buddies]]". She found herself apartment-sharing with [[Mary Marvel]] and, in a characterization reminiscent of her former interactions with Ice, forced herself into the reluctant role of "babysitter" for the woefully naive teenager. It should be noted that subsequent publications have partly called into question whether or not the "Super Buddies" still count as official continuity, though Fire and Mary Marvel have been shown to continue to interact.

{{spoiler}}
As depicted in [[The OMAC Project]] #4, it seems that after the dissolution of the [[Super Buddies]] Fire had returned to her work as detective and secret agent. In that role she helped [[Booster Gold]] and [[Guy_Gardner_(comics)|Guy Gardner]] to find the connection between [[Maxwell Lord]] and [[Blue Beetle]]'s death. She then took part in an assault by her former teammates from [[JLA|Justice League International]] and the [[Super Buddies]] against a group of [[OMACs]]. Badly wounded, she was saved by the sacrifice of [[Rocket Red|Rocket Red]].
[[Guy_Gardner_(comics)|Guy Gardner]] and [[Booster Gold]] took her to a hospital. As of this writing (October 2005) her further fate is unrevealed.

==Appearances in other media==
Fire appeared in the ''Justice League of America'' TV Pilot movie. She was played by [[Michelle Hurd]].

Fire and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] have both made several appearances in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[animated series]], with Fire having (so far) the only speaking appearance of the two during a main role in the third season premiere, "I Am Legion." Fire seems to be a distinct novice within the League, given her nervousness about contradicting anybody who's a senior member. Also, Fire and [[Wally West|Flash]] have been engaging in a relationship of mutual flirting (although Flash is unusually shy about her, implying perhaps that he is more seriously interested in her than might be expected). However, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] (Wally's wife in the comics) is due to be introduced in ''Flash and Substance'', so Flash may have a few women to contend with soon. It should, however, be noted that [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart (Green Lantern)]]'s relationship with [[Hawkgirl|Shayera Hol (Hawkgirl)]] establishes a DCAU precedent for romantic relationships that have no basis in the comics. No voice actor was credited for her, but it is surmised that [[Maria Canals]], who voices Hawkgirl, supplied Fire's voice.
