==Pre-Crisis fictional character biography==

===Super Friends===
[[File:GreenFury.jpg|left|thumb|110px|Beatriz as the Green Fury]]
'''Beatriz da Costa''', alias '''Green Fury''',  had originally been bequeathed her powers due to Brazilian mysticism and was the president of the Brazilian branch of [[Wayne Enterprises]]. She possessed an array of abilities which included the power to exhale vast quantities of mystical green fire. She could also fly, alter her clothing at will, and displayed a limited capacity to project hallucinations. In her first appearance, she confronted and battled [[Superman]], who was controlled by the "puppet master" Overlord, Sandor Fine. In her next appearance, Green Fury called The [[Super Friends]] to help defeat the villain Green Thumb (Fargo Keyes),<ref>"Super Friends" #42 (March 1981)</ref> and months later revealed her secret origin to them to thwart the demons from a green hell.

===Global Guardians===
Green Fury became a member of the Global Guardians when Superman, recruited by [[Doctor Mist]], asks for assistance in locating one of many ancient artifacts being pursued by a powerful group of evil mystics.<ref name="dc-glob">{{Cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link = Robert Greenberger|contribution = Global Guardians|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 138|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017|postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> They battle a wizard called 'El Dorado' in an ancient, overgrown city deep in the jungle. The two face off against 'spirit jaguars' and seemingly lose the artifact, a crown, to the wizard. Costa then assists Superman and other Guardians in battling the wizards El Dorado included, on [[Easter Island]]. The heroes catch a break when it's learned Superman had faked the artifacts with super-speed. This prevents the rise to power of the entity the wizards followed, Thaumar Dhai. Though not as powerful as planned, Dhai was still a threat. Green Fury's mystical based powers were essential in destroying him.

==Post-Crisis fictional character biography==
After the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', her history was altered so that she had followed an unusual career path.  Renamed '''Beatriz Bonilla da Costa''', she started as an amateur model on the beaches of Rio, then becoming a showgirl and stage performer before finding herself serving as a top secret agent for Brazilian government's SNI (Serviço Nacional de Informações - National Information Service), actually Abin (Agência Brasileira de Inteligência - Brazilian Intelligence Agency). In the course of one of her missions, Beatriz was trapped in a pyroplasmic explosion that endowed her with the unusual power of being able to exhale an eight-inch burst of fire. She assumed the identity of the '''Green Fury''', and then soon changed it again to '''Green Flame.''' She joined the international superhero team the [[Global Guardians]], of which she was a long-standing, loyal member. (''[[Secret Origins]]'' #33)

She first met the American heroes [[Infinity, Inc.]] while on a mission to Canada. (''Infinity, Inc.'' #32)

===Justice League===
[[File:FireandIce.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Green Flame and Icemaiden]]
Shortly after changing her name to Green Flame, the Guardians' [[United Nations]] funding was withdrawn in the wake of the formation the [[Justice League International]]. Beatriz convinced her teammate and best friend Icemaiden into joining her to apply for [[Justice League International]] membership. Remarkably, in the wake of [[Black Canary]]'s resignation and the abduction of several members, the short-handed JLI took them on.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''Justice League International'' #14</ref> Eventually, she once again changed her heroic name, this time to '''Fire''' in affinity with Icemaiden's shortening of her name to simply [[Ice (comics)|Ice]].<ref>''Justice League International'' #19</ref> As a result of the "gene bomb" detonated by the alien [[Dominators]], Fire's powers were dramatically increased, but were less reliable for a time.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''Invasion!'' #3, ''Justice League America'' #28</ref>

Fire always assumed a big sister role with Ice, watching out for her and her interactions with the "real" world. For example, Fire stepped in when Ice did not realize she was being stalked by a delusional fan. However, Fire herself makes mistakes, such as torching the cash she'd just saved while foiling a bank robbery.

Beatriz remained with the Justice League International for the remainder of its existence — in fact she served the longest tenure of any JLI member.  During this time, she was also trained in the arts of battle by [[Big Barda]].

In the battle against [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Bea lost her powers by taxing them to their limits while trying to blast Doomsday, in effect "her fire went out".<ref>''Superman'' vol. 2 #74</ref> She remained with the team but by the time she returned in ''Justice League America'' #88, it was too late to help prevent her best friend's death, as Ice was killed by the [[Overmaster]].<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''[[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]'' #14</ref> As Beatriz tried to cope with this loss, she briefly had a romantic relationship with Ice's former lover, [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], and a longer one with [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]]. When the first [[Icemaiden]], Sigrid Nansen, joined the League Ice's place, Fire befriended her. However, their friendship was tainted by Bea's irrational grief-driven behavior, and Sigrid's romantic attraction to Bea.

When this League collapsed, Beatriz returned to Brazil, and tried to re-establish herself as the country's main protector. This met with varied success, which she blamed partly on the [[Martian Manhunter]]'s prominence in the Southern hemisphere.<ref>''Martian Manhunter'' #10</ref>

===The Super Buddies===
Fire eventually tried to retire from being a superhero and establish a career as an internet glamor girl when [[Maxwell Lord]] talks her and several other former JLI members into reforming as a group of "heroes for the common man" called the "[[Super Buddies]]". She found herself sharing an apartment with [[Mary Marvel]] and, in a characterization reminiscent of her relationship with Ice, became a reluctant "babysitter" for the naive teenager.

In one adventure with the Super Buddies, Fire and the others were given the opportunity to rescue Ice's spirit from Hell (or a similar dimension). Yet like in the Greek myth of [[Myth of Orpheus|Orpheus and Eurydice]], Fire could not resist looking behind her, which caused Ice's spirit to vanish. During the Super Buddies' time in Hell, [[Etrigan the Demon]] suggested that it was Fire who was fated to die instead of Ice.

Later, during her time in the group, she encounters an alternate universe version of Ice.

===Infinite Crisis===
The Super Buddies did not realize that Maxwell Lord was also secretly the Black King of [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]. After the Buddies' dissolution, Bea became an agent of Checkmate as well.<ref name="dc-ency"/> It has not been revealed whether Lord recruited her. Regardless, she helps Booster Gold and Guy Gardner find the connection between Lord and the death of the [[Blue Beetle]]. She joins her former JLI teammates against a group of [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]]. She is badly wounded, but is saved by the sacrifice of [[Dimitri Pushkin]], the Rocket Red.<ref>''[[The OMAC Project]]'' #4</ref>

During the "[[Infinite Crisis]]," created by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]], Beatriz returns to her espionage roots by joining [[Amanda Waller]], who took over Checkmate after Lord's death.<ref name="dc-ency"/> One of Fire's first missions was to retrieve the A.I., Brother Eye, which had crashed down in Southern Saudi Arabia. This plan was thwarted by [[Sasha Bordeaux]], also formerly of Checkmate.<ref name="OMAC Project Special">''OMAC Project Special''</ref>

She appears later, criticizing [[Booster Gold|Booster]] for his shameless self-promotion while the search continues for the missing superheroes.<ref>''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #4</ref> She is also on hand at a memorial for [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny's]] wife, [[Sue Dibny|Sue]].<ref>''52'' #42</ref>

===Checkmate===
{{main|Checkmate (comics)}}

Nearly [[One Year Later|one year later]], after the Crisis, Checkmate was reformed under the supervision of the United Nations and Beatriz became the Black King's Knight.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>''Checkmate'' #1</ref> Though she no longer reported to Waller (who was made White Queen), Waller blackmailed Bea with evidence against her father and forced Bea to perform covert assassinations.<ref>''Checkmate'' #11</ref> Waller had previously implied that Beatriz actually enjoyed the violence and depravity that was a part of her job.<ref name="OMAC Project Special"/> It was revealed that as a girl Bea had been trained to kill by her father.<ref>''Checkmate'' #11-12</ref>

Despite her past as a dutiful soldier and daughter, Bea expressed remorse over taking part in a Checkmate mission that resulted in the deaths of as many as 50 [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]] agents, many of whom were immolated by Fire herself.<ref>''Checkmate'' #2</ref> Waller once again blackmailed Fire into covering up a coup in [[Santa Prisca]]. There, Fire killed Colonel Computron for Waller in order to protect her father, who, in the mid-1970s, under a right wing military dictatorship, had ordered thousands of innocent deaths in [[Operation Condor]], a US-supported <ref>{{cite web|title =Operation Condor: Cable Suggests U.S. Role|publisher =[[National Security Archive]]|date=6 March 2001|url =http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20010306/|accessdate =2006-12-15 }}</ref> South American [[Anticommunism|anti-communist]] program that involved assassinations, [[torture]] and forced disappearances. He was never caught and Beatriz had always kept his secret.

When the murder of Computron was exposed by fellow Knight [[Thomas Jagger|Tommy Jagger]], Fire was jailed. After a visit from her superior, the Black King, Col. Taleb Beni Khalid-Isr, Beatriz agreed to turn over her father to international authorities for war crimes. Khalid had convinced her to act as the superhero that he'd chosen for his Knight.

===Reunited with Ice===
In Checkmate #16, after years of anguish and grief over the loss of her friend and ally Ice, Fire is at last reunited with her after the long-deceased hero is miraculously resurrected in the pages of [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]].<ref>"Birds Of Prey" #107 (August 2007)</ref>

Their renewed relationship, never shown on panel, is referenced again when Ice, accepting a date on Oa with her lover [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], refuses his proposal to cohabit on Oa claiming how she decided to get her life together, on Earth, with some help from Beatriz herself. Gardner claims that Fire is manipulating Ice.<ref>"Green Lantern Corps" vol. 2 #29 (October 2008)</ref>

===Generation Lost===
Fire appears as one of the central characters in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', a maxi-series that takes place during the wider ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event. At the start of the series, Fire is recruited as part of a massive group of superheroes tasked with hunting down the JLI's founder and [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]]'s murderer, [[Maxwell Lord]]. During an encounter with Max at the Justice League's former New York headquarters, Fire is rendered unconscious alongside [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], [[Booster Gold]], and [[Captain Atom]]. The former Justice League members awake to discover that Lord has used his mental abilities to erase his existence from the minds of every single human on the planet, save for those present at the embassy.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> After she tries to tell [[Wonder Woman]] of her killing  of Lord, Wonder Woman refuses to believe it. Fire discovers that Max has mentally influenced the world into believing that Checkmate has dismissed her for failing her psychological evaluation.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (May 2010)</ref>

Afterward, Fire encounters Lord in JLI headquarters.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #8 (August 2010)</ref> After mind-controlling Fire and then Booster Gold to prevent them from stopping him, he ports from the old JLI embassy back to Checkmate.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #9 (September 2010)</ref> Before they can figure out their next move, the base comes under attack by the [[Creature Commandos]]. Caught while powered down, Fire is shown having been shot several times.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #15 (December 2010)</ref> Fire is able to heal by using the bandages of the medic mummy of the Creature Commandos, but is unable to keep Blue Beetle from being kidnapped by Maxwell Lord.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #16 (December 2010)</ref> While the team deals with the apparent loss of Blue Beetle, Fire bonds with Gavril Ivanovich the current [[Rocket Red]] and the two grow close, eventually sharing a passionate kiss.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #21 (March 2011)</ref>

==New 52==
===Justice League International===
Fire appears as part of the [[Justice League International]] team under [[DC Comics]] [[New 52]] reboot.  Fire is injured toward the end of the first story arc and is sidelined for the remainder of the run.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Fire (comics) showing her powers.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Fire blasts green flames.]]
The original Green Fury had magical flame breath powers due to Brazilian mysticism. She could control her flame breath to allow her to fly and land like a rocket.  She was able to mystically alter her clothing when needed and change the color of her eyes from green to black, and vice versa. She was also able to create and cast illusions with her 'dazzle power' and fire blasts with her white-hot flame or super-cold freezing flame. Her green flame had the magical ability to heal and repair her costume after a battle.  Beatriz was also trained by [[Batman]] in hand-to-hand combat. Due to the events of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Green Fury never had any of these magical powers and had a new revised origin.

In her Post-Crisis incarnation, Beatriz's only power, gained from saturation by an organic energy source called '''''Pyroplasm''''', was the ability to breathe a jet of green flame from her mouth.  During the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' crossover event, the alien [[Dominators]] set off a "[[metagene]] bomb" in the upper atmosphere which affected almost all DC characters with superpowers and, after a period of illness, Fire found her powers greatly magnified as an [[wiktionary:after-effect|after-effect]]. The "new" Fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green plasma, in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts]. Solid objects could pass completely through her form without causing injury. Unfortunately, it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers, and she often "flamed on" involuntarily when stressed or angry (and sometimes still does), a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts. The Super Buddies continuity established (and made light of) the fact that flaming on destroyed Bea's clothing, rendering her naked when she stopped using her powers. ''Checkmate'' and other appearances have ignored this. Beatriz is also a skilled investigator and espionage agent, and in the latter context was considered a valuable asset by Checkmate chief Amanda Waller for her ability and willingness to kill in order to complete missions (unlike many of her contemporaries who maintain a no-kill policy).

==In other media==

===Television===
[[File:FireMovie.jpg|right|thumb|125px|[[Michelle Hurd]] as Fire.]]
* Fire appeared in the ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]'' television pilot movie. She was played by [[Michelle Hurd]].

[[File:FireJLU.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Fire on ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]
* Fire and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] both made several appearances in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]], although only Fire had any dialogue where she was voiced by [[María Canals Barrera]]. Fire's costume in "normal" mode was a vaguely armored tank top and pants, while she sported light-green hair and a distinct Latina appearance. In "Fire" mode, however, her facial features change drastically along with the rest of her appearance: green luminous hair and skin, with flame-like entities covering her private parts  (according to producer [[Bruce Timm]], her first appearance while powered up in JLU had to be reshot several times to satisfy the [[censorship|censors]]). Fire seemed to be a distinct novice within the League, given her nervousness about contradicting senior members. Although both she and her friend [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] were used primarily in group shots, Fire had several action sequences; her first battle was during "The Return", where she temporarily got the better of the android [[Amazo]] until he 'learned' her powers and casually swatted her away. She was rescued by the [[Red Tornado]]. In "I Am Legion", Fire and [[Wally West|Flash]] engaged in a relationship of mutual flirting (although Flash was unusually shy about her). In the episode "Grudge Match", Fire appeared as a member of a female-only fight club. [[Black Canary]] and Fire, both under mind control, were pitted against one another in one of [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette's]] organized cage matches. Black Canary won the fight and Fire was seriously injured. She was seen again at the end of the episode being helped out of the building by other League members after Roulette was defeated. Fire has one speaking line in the episode. In the final episode, Fire appeared in a swimming pool in Rio with Ice poolside and they are both teleported away to aid in the battle against [[Darkseid]]'s invasion of Earth. They are shown in the final "run-off" sequence with Justice League International contemporaries [[Elongated Man]] and [[Booster Gold]].

[[File:Firerrrrrrr3.JPG|right|thumb|125px|Fire on ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''.]]
* Fire appears briefly in the second episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. She is first seen in "Terror on Dinosaur Island" helping [[Plastic Man]] and Batman fight [[Gentleman Ghost]]. Her appearance bears some resemblance to the original Green Fury character design: she wears a mask, and though her pyrokinesis is directed through her hands rather than from her mouth, she is not shown to transform into a flaming green entity.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bigshinyrobot.com/reviews/archives/544 |title=Big Shiny Robot! |publisher=Big Shiny Robot! |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> In the second season of the series, she also appears in a non-speaking cameo in the episode "Sidekicks Assemble!", aboard the [[Watchtower (comics)|Watchtower]]. Additionally, Fire appears briefly among the heroes possessed by [[Starro]], in the final prologue short pointing to the two-part episode "The Siege of Starro", contained in the episode "The Power of Shazam!". Fire returns in "Darkseid Descending!" and "Time Out for Vengeance", as a member of the Justice League International. She sports an updated costume without a mask, and also demonstrates the ability to change into her living fire form. Like the comics, she is also shown as being close friends with [[Ice (comics)|Ice]]. In the series' final season, she appears in "Shadow of the Bat!" alongside JLI members [[Blue Beetle]], [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Aquaman]], [[Booster Gold]], and Ice, fighting a vampiric Batman aboard the Watchtower. An alternate version of Fire appears in "Deep Cover for Batman" as a member of the Injustice Syndicate. This version appears with an orange and black costume and blond hair, and is shown to shoot flames from her mouth.

* Fire appears in episode 46 of ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]''. She joins the other superheroes in a musical number that asks Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called "Super Friends."

* On the television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in the episode "Power Outage", Fire's alter ego Bea da Costa is mentioned as one of the people who seemingly died as a result of the particle accelerator accident that gave [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] his powers.

===Video games===
* Fire appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Shawn Sides]].

===Web series===
* Fire is one of the background students of Super Hero High in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]''.
