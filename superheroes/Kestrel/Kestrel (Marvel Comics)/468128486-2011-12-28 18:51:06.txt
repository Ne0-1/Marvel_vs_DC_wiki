'''John Wraith''', also known as '''Kestrel''', is a character in the [[Marvel comics]] fictional universe. In the 2009 superhero movie, ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', Wraith is portrayed by [[will.i.am]].

==Fictional character biography==
Kestrel was a member of [[Team X (comics)|Team X]] and later a test subject of the [[Weapon X]] Program. He was part of Team X along with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Victor Creed|Sabretooth]], [[Christoph Nord|Maverick]], [[Mastodon (comics)|Mastodon]], and [[Silver Fox]]. John Wraith was a powerful teleporter, capable of getting the team out of sticky situations after their job was finished. He had a penchant for explosives, arming himself with shaped charges, explosives that were built to direct the force of their blast in specific directions based on how they are deployed. Like the other members of Team X, he was given an artificial age suppressant so he was likely much older than he looked. His time as a secret agent and a member of the Weapon X program left John somewhat paranoid. His house was a veritable death trap, as was the yard around it - John trusted no one.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

He made a habit of keeping his skill a secret from his compatriots as well as his foes, using it only sparingly, and if no one was looking directly at him - unless it was absolutely vital. The only time when his fellow Team-X members found out about his powers was when they went up against [[Omega Red]]. John was backup on that mission that Wolverine, Maverick, and Sabretooth ran in Germany to collect a carbonadium synthesizer, and when that trio burst out of the target compound with Red in pursuit, John stalled him with his gun until the others got away. Unfazed, Omega went to wrap John up and tear him to pieces, but John teleported to safety at the last second, with only Wolverine and Omega Red seeing this. There was also a certain animosity between him and Sabretooth. He was about as violent as his fellows from the Weapon X program, but a lot more merciful and didn't enjoy killing innocents while on a mission, which put him at odds with people like Sabretooth. Sabretooth once languished for quite a time in John's basement with several shaped charges strapped to his chest. Unless he had a really good reason to, Sabretooth wouldn't lift a finger to help John.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

Years later, John had tracked Wolverine and the rest of his old teammates down because it seemed that there was a problem with the age suppression factors given to them by Weapon X, as one of their number, Mastodon, had suddenly aged quite rapidly and been reduced into a pile of ooze. With their help, John discovered a list of termination candidates from the Weapon X project. They recognized themselves on the list plus a man named Aldo Ferro, who they knew was a big time mafia chief, Il Topo Siciliano. They tracked Ferro to his secluded island where they discovered Maverick guarding him. Maverick soon changed sides when Ferro, aka. Psi-Borg, revealed that he was the one who used his psi-powers to speed the false memory implantation of the Weapon X subjects. After this fiasco, John hung out with Wolverine for a month or two, but then vanished.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

Wraith was later re-recruited into Weapon X by the "[[Malcolm Colcord|Director]]" and his mission was to recruit Maverick as well. However, Maverick fought back and Wraith was shot and then had his neck broken by Sabretooth, who was planning on betraying the Program and couldn't trust Wraith.  He was left for dead, but managed to survive, later becoming a preacher. However, he was the first victim to be killed by a demon-possessed Wolverine, as he was now depowered and could no longer teleport. <ref>''Wolverine'' issue 1 2010</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Wraith had the psionic ability to phase-jump; meaning he could seemingly disappear at will from any point in space and appear at another, with what would appear to be an exceptionally high range. He could move about space at will, appearing and disappearing in a fashion that left no flashy burst of light or sound and he could even take others with him. He also had a life-extending serum in his blood, due to his involvement in the Weapon X program. He liked using "shaped charges," bombs whose blasts are precisely controlled.

Unlike his mainstream mutant counterpart, the Ultimate Marvel version of John Wraith is a white human. Colonel John Wraith was a mutant-hating commando who was sanctioned by S.H.I.E.L.D. to head the barbaric [[Weapon X]] Program. The program was assigned with capturing mutants and forcing them to carry out covert missions for the U.S. Government. The program was co-headed by a Dr. [[Abraham Cornelius]]. He and his men (all who have anti-mutant sentiments as well) managed to capture and subject a [[Canadian]] para-trooper named James "Lucky Jim" Howlett to experiments which wiped his memories clean and bonded his skeleton with adamantium. They christened him Weapon X and gave him the fake name "Logan". He and his men enjoyed tormenting Logan by teasing him with bits and pieces of his lost memories and also caging him and shooting him day and night since he could not die due to his mutant healing factor. This conditioned Logan to become the perfect killing machine, or so they thought. During the [[Gulf War]] they were transporting him in the desert preparing him for deployment, but his transport team was ambushed and Wolverine was accidentally set loose. Stumbling across a younger [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]], who was also taken by surprise by the same ambush, Logan rescued him and brought him back to base camp. Colonel Wraith, who was surprised that Wolverine retained his humanity by not killing Fury, ordered his men to shoot and cage Logan once again. He told Fury not to worry about Wolverine since he was nothing more than a living weapon. A couple of years later, Fury returned the favor to Logan by helping him escape from the Weapon X facility. Wraith sent [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], another one of his mutant agents, after Logan but he came back empty-handed. Wraith then began capturing other mutants to take Wolverine's place, mutants including [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Cain Marko]]. When he received news that Logan was headed back to America (unknown to them as an assassin for [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]), he and his men again attempted to recapture Logan, only to have their plans foiled by the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. Wraith's face was scarred by Logan's claws. In retribution, Wraith ordered the capture of the X-Men, but failed to catch Logan once again. He had Xavier hooked up to machines to harness the Professor's telepathy in order to help him find other potential candidates for the program. The mutants imprisoned at the Weapon X facility were tortured on a daily basis, with Rogue having her arm broken regularly and having molten metal poured on [[Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]] to test his durability. It was also during this time that [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] was mutated even further by Dr. Cornelius. To keep them in line, Wraith had implanted micro explosives into them and if anyone got out of line or tried to escape, it was their friends who would pay the price. The X-Men's first major mission forced them to split up. One team was assigned to free [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] from when he was captured by a foreign country and the other team was assigned with destroying a new bio weapon that was being developed by terrorists. [[Jean Grey]] was given the order to execute one of the scientists they had captured, but she refused. Wraith threatened to detonate [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' implants for her insubordination, at which point she was forced to kill someone for the very first time. When [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] threatened to phase out Weapon X, Wraith used Xavier to dispose of the general with a mental explosion. Wolverine was eventually captured, but unknown to them, he had secretly led the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]] to the facility in an attempt of freeing the imprisoned mutants. When the mutants began to break free, Wraith shot Xavier and attempted to flee in a helicopter. [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] held onto Wraith's helicopter, but eventually he lost his grip. Storm tried to fry Wraith with lightning, but [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] saved the Colonel. As a reward, Wraith tried to kill the teleporter. Nick Fury kills Wraith and declares that all the mutants at the facility were free to go. Canadian government forces save John's life by injecting him with the drug Banshee. He is made leader of [[Alpha Flight]]. He also gains superpowers. Wraith decides to call himself [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Vindicator]]. His team  went to retrieve [[Northstar]], which led the X-Men to find out that Wraith's team all use Banshee. It wasn't until after the Ultimatum wave that Rogue sought out Wraith who found out his identity during a previous battle when some of the X-Men went to rescue Northstar. She convinced him to help her kill Magneto. He needed few more people to help with this mission so he and Rogue went and captured [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] to reform Weapon X.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' episode "Target X," Omega Red references both Maverick and Kestrel to Wolverine, mentioning "Wraith" during a rundown of his Weapon X adversaries.
* In ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', '''Colonel Moss''' (voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]) is based on the Ultimate Marvel version of John Wraith. He heads up the [[Mutant Response Division]] and has some vendetta against Wolverine (Moss has claw marks across his face thanks to Logan at some point in the past). He was a former head of [[Weapon X]]. In the Sentinel-dominated future, he is a [[cyborg]] who handles putting power dampeners on mutants in prisons. Whenever his biological half is compromised by a [[telepath]], his [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] mode would take over.

===Film===
* In the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', John Wraith is portrayed by recording artist [[will.i.am]] (of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]).<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 Reynolds, will.i.am join 'Wolverine' - Entertainment News, Film News, Media - Variety<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Wraith, a teleporting mutant, is a member of Team X, also consisting of [[Wolverine (comics)|James "Logan" Howlett]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Wade Wilson]], [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]], [[Chris Bradley]], and [[Blob (comics)|Fred Dukes]], under the leadership of [[William Stryker]]. While initially loyal to the team, Wraith eventually quits the team due to morality issues (he, like Logan, did not like the killing they did but was forced to follow orders anyway, like abducting fellow mutants, under Stryker's employment) and becomes a boxing manager. He appears to be the one member whom Wolverine fully trusts, being the first whom he pays a visit after so many years. When Wolverine arrives for information about Stryker's base, he tells him to ask Dukes, who is now obese and is boxing to keep in shape. Before giving Logan any information, Dukes challenges Logan to a boxing match. Logan wins thanks to his new adamantium skeleton, and Dukes directs him toward [[Gambit (comics)|Remy LeBeau]], an escaped captive. Wraith goes with Wolverine which leads them to a casino in Louisiana. Wraith guards the back, only to be confronted by Creed. Knowing that he killed Bradley, Wade and apparently Dukes, Wraith fights Creed with the intention of killing him, despite having agreed to leave him for Wolverine. Wraith uses his teleportation ability to his advantage and manages to strike Creed multiple times, but Creed, predicting Wraith's move, eventually grabs Wraith's spine by positioning his hand in exactly the right place to grab it as Wraith appears, mortally wounding him. Creed takes a sample of Wraith's blood and his teleportation ability is used for Weapon XI/Deadpool. <ref>[http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/features/wolverine_characters/wolverinecharacters_JohnWraith.jpg John Wraith as portrayed by will.i.am in X-Men Origins: Wolverine]</ref>

===Video games===
* In the ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' game, Wraith appears voiced by [[Will.i.am]]. His role is more or less the same in the film, save that he first appears when Wolverine is rescuing him from the headquarters of Project: WideAwake with the aid of [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], during which it is implied that he is the father of Wolverine's future X-Man teammate [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. He leads Logan to Team X colleague [[Frederick Dukes]], then leads him to [[Gambit (comics)|Remy LeBeau]], and covers the back of his casino. Victor Creed sneak attacks and kills Wraith.
