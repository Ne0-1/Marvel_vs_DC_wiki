'''Danielle Moonstar''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[Marvel Comics]].  She is a [[mutant]] [[superhero]] with ties to the [[X-Men]].  She first appeared in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #4: ''The New Mutants''.  She has also gone by the codenames '''Psyche''', '''Mirage''' and '''Moonstar'''.

Danielle Moonstar is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (specifically, [[Cheyenne]]), and was raised in [[Colorado]] by her grandfather, Black Eagle.  As with most mutants, Dani's mutant powers manifested during puberty.  The [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] attempted to capture her, and in the melee, her grandfather was killed.  Luckily, he had already contacted [[Professor X]] to take care of Dani.

Danielle's mutant powers allow her to manifest a person's greatest fears and desires in the form of [[psychic]] [[illusion]]s.  In addition, she can communicate telepathically with animals.  

Danielle and her teammates found themselves abducted by Loki and spirited away to Asgard, soon after they had rescued their teammate, Karma, from the Shadow King. While in Asgard, Danielle rescued a flying horse named Brightwind from a trap that would have likely killed him. Her bond that was forged with Brightwind obligated her to assume the mantle of a Valkyrie, even though she was mortal. She reluctantly joined the [[Valkyries]], and obtained the ability to sense the presence of [[death]].  Shortly after becoming a Valkyrie, she and the other [[New Mutants]] attempted to save former teammate [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] from the [[High Evolutionary]]. During the fight, Danielle was thrown into a machine intended to strip mutants of their powers. Instead, the machine enhanced her mutation, giving her the ability to make the telepathic images manifest in reality, becoming solid. This ability was limited in that Danielle could only sustain one illusion at a time. She often carried around a "dream spear", in  order to destroy previous illusions. At a later point, she refined her psychic ability so that she could cast "psychic arrows," which incapacitated their targets. She once had the ability to manipulate quantum energy as concussive blasts, but this power is apparently gone now.

Danielle was a member of the [[New Mutants]] for several years; after that, she joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and infiltrated the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].  Once that ended, she rejoined her old teammates, who were then in [[X-Force]].

She is currently the mentor of the new New Mutants squad at the Xavier Institute (and the legal guardian of [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]), and the Institute's American History teacher. Due to the events that led to her leaving X-Force, the bulk of her powers have reverted to their original form.

{{spoiler}}
In the wake of the House of M crossover, [[The Scarlet Witch]] has caused many mutants to lose their powers. Dani was one of the many who lost their powers, and was asked by [[Emma Frost]] to leave the Xavier Institute, her future remains uncertain.  However, she and 12 other candiates are rumored to become one of Apocalypse's New Horsemen.[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=11&fldAuto=271]
