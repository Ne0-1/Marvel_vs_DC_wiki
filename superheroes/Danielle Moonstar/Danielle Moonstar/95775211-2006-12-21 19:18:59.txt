'''Danielle Moonstar,''' originally codenamed '''Psyche''' and later '''Mirage,''' is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], she first appeared in ''Marvel [[Graphic Novel]]'' #4: ''[[The New Mutants]]'' (1982). 

A [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], Moonstar originally possessed the ability to create [[illusion]]s of her opponents’ fears. She later developed a wide range of [[telepathy|psionic]] and [[energy]] manipulation powers. She was a member of the X-Men’s [[1980s]] junior team The New Mutants and, after a long absence, its reincarnation [[X-Force]]. 

One of the few [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] superheroes, Moonstar is very in touch with her [[Cheyenne]] heritage.



==Fictional character biography==
Danielle Moonstar is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (specifically, [[Cheyenne]]), and was raised in [[Colorado]].  As with most mutants, Dani's mutant powers manifested during puberty. One of her first manifestations was a vision of her parents' death, killed by a demonic bear. Shortly afterwards her parents disappeared and Dani was taken in by her grandfather, Black Eagle. The [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] attempted to capture her, and in the melee, her grandfather was killed.  Luckily, he had already contacted [[Professor X]] to take care of Dani. Xavier, who had been a close friend of Moonstar's father, offered to teach Dani control over her powers. She joined his group of students called the [[New Mutants]] and shortly afterwards became the co-leader of the group together with [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]].

Moonstar started to have nightmares again about the Demon Bear, who until then had been kept from her due to Black Eagle's protective spells. One night she was attacked by it and taken to hospital. The other New Mutants battled the Demon Bear. The New Mutant [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] managed to pierce the Demon Bear with her magical sword and the Demon Bear returned to his original form: William and Peg Lonestar. Dani was reunited with her parents, but decided to stay at the Xavier's school. 

Moonstar and her teammates found themselves abducted by Loki and spirited away to Asgard, soon after they had rescued their teammate, Karma, from the Shadow King. While in Asgard, Moonstar rescued a flying horse named Brightwind from a trap that would have likely killed him. Her bond that was forged with Brightwind obliged her to assume the mantle of a Valkyrie, even though she was mortal. She reluctantly joined the [[Valkyries]], and obtained the ability to sense the presence of [[death]].  

Shortly after becoming a Valkyrie, she and the other [[New Mutants]] attempted to save former teammate [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] from the [[High Evolutionary]]. During the fight, Moonstar was thrown into a machine intended to strip mutants of their powers. Instead, the machine - which had been reset by two other victims of the Evolutionary's plan, enhanced her mutation, giving her the ability to make the telepathic images manifest in reality, becoming solid. This ability was limited in that Danielle could only sustain one illusion at a time. She often carried around a "dream spear", in  order to destroy previous illusions. At a later point, she refined her psychic ability so that she could cast "psychic arrows," which incapacitated their targets. She once had the ability to manipulate quantum energy as concussive blasts, but this power is apparently gone now.

Moonstar was a member of the [[New Mutants]] for several years; after that, she joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and infiltrated the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].  Once that ended, she rejoined her old teammates, who were then in [[X-Force]]. She left X-force when the team contacted [[Pete Wisdom]], hoping that he would help them become more pro-active, a direction she disagreed with. 

After a short time as part-time X-man, Moonstar became the mentor of the new New Mutants squad at the Xavier Institute (and the legal guardian of [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]), and the Institute's American History teacher. The bulk of her powers have reverted to their original form.

{{spoiler}}

In the wake of the [[House of M]] crossover, [[The Scarlet Witch]] has caused many mutants to lose their powers. Moonstar was one of the many who lost their powers, and was asked by [[Emma Frost]] to leave the Xavier Institute. She briefly reappeared in ''[[Generation M (comics)|Generation M]]'' #5, in which she revealed she hadn't dreamt since M-Day.

==Powers and abilities==
Moonstar has an [[empathic]] [[psi]] talent that allows her to manifest people's emotions as realistic illusions. She can even create illusions by channeling residual thought and emotional impressions in an area (such as showing [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] a battle scene between [[Mr. Sinister]] and unknown assailants, simply by entering the area where the battle had recently taken place). She also has the ability to make the telepathic images manifest in reality, becoming solid. This ability was limited in that Danielle could only sustain one illusion at a time. She often carried around a "dream spear", in order to destroy previous illusions.  She can focus her psionic powers into energy arrows which can stun an opponent by disrupting their [[central nervous system]], or force them to relive a traumatic memory. Moonstar has a [[telepathic]] talent that allows her to communicate with animals (an ability that proved to be very valuable, since it enabled her to communicate with [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] when she was trapped in her wolfen form).
For a short time, a young mutant girl with reality warping abilities gave Moonstar the ability to manipulate [[quantum]] energies to affect energy and matter on a [[subatomic]] level and fire powerful energy blasts (but these powers were only temporary).
When Moonstar found Brightwind, she became a Valkyrie. As a Valkyrie, Moonstar could see a dark cloud over people who were in mortal peril. Usually her actions allowed her to prevent their death. She could even battle Death itself to protect these people, but learned that it was often best not to interfere once Death came for them. 
Because of [[Scarlet Witch]]'s powers, Moonstar has been turned into a human and has no powers.

== Alternate versions ==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse, Moonstar became one of Apocalypse's followers and a member of the ''Pale Riders'', one of the Dark Lord's team of assassins, a position she earned due to her sadism and ruthlessness. Due to her origins, she was capable of infiltrating John Proudstar's Ghost Dance, learning that Nightcrawler was seeking a way to reach Avalon.

Apocalypse sent the Pale Riders to follow Nightcrawler and destroy Avalon, however, during the journey, the sadistic Moonstar began to torture ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Dead Man Wade]]'' for fun, as his healing factor would regenerate any kind of wound. This angered [[Damask (comics)#Alternate_versions|Damask]], the Pale Riders leader, who killed Moonstar after she refused to stop.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]], Mirage is a mutant [[sorceress]] and a member of the X-men along with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and formerly [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. In this universe, she apparently has the ability to summon small monsters, and is [[India]]n instead of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].

==In other media==
In the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' [[animated TV series]], Moonstar appeared in the episode, "Ghost of Chance". In the episode, Moonstar repeatedly calls [[Kitty Pryde]] in her dreams to save her after she is lost for almost two years in a cavern. She was voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]]. 

In the film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', Moonstar can be seen sitting between [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] in Professor Xavier's physics class, which Wolverine disrupts.

In the film ''[[X2: X-Men United]]'', her name appears on a list of names [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] scrolls through on [[William Stryker|Stryker's]] computer while looking for [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] file. You can also see her in the deleted Jubilee Museum scene.
