'''Danielle Moonstar''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[Marvel Comics]].  She is a [[mutant]] [[superhero]] with ties to the [[X-Men]].  She first appeared in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #4: ''The New Mutants''.  She has also gone by the codenames '''Psyche''', '''Mirage''' and '''Moonstar'''.

Danielle Moonstar is a [[Native American]] (specifically, [[Cheyenne]]), and was raised in [[Colorado]] by her grandfather, Black Eagle.  Her mutant power manifested itself during puberty.  The [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] attempted to capture her, and in the melee her grandfather was killed.  Luckily, he had already contacted [[Professor X]] to take care of Dani.

Danielle's mutant power allows her to manifest a person's greatest fears in the form of [[psychic]] [[illusion]]s.  She also has a telepathic bond with animals.  She once became a member of the [[Valkyries]], more or less against her will, and obtained from them a flying steed named Brightwind and the ability to sense the presence of [[death]].  At a later point, she refined her psychic ability so that she could cast "psychic arrows", which incapacitate their targets.

Danielle was a member of the [[New Mutants]] for several years; after this point, she joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and infiltrated the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].  Once that ended, she rejoined her old teammates, who were now in [[X-Force]].

She is currently the mentor of the new New Mutants squad at the Xavier Institute (and the legal guardian of [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]), and the Institute's American History teacher. She has discontinued the use of the "arrows," preferring once more to simply cast illusions.
