==Fictional character biography==
Wallace Jackson was a 16-year old, who wore a costume designed by his uncle who worked for NASA. He decided to come to New York City to play fight with his favorite superhero, [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man did his best to outsmart the kid, and they fought until they crashed through a window at the State Street Hospital. Red Nine had a high fever and passed out, so Spider-Man left him there. Red Nine woke up and looked for Spider-Man again, and this time Spider-Man destroyed Red Nine's costume, but Spider-Man later learned that Wallace helped a group of elderly patients against a mean hospital administrator.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #264</ref>
