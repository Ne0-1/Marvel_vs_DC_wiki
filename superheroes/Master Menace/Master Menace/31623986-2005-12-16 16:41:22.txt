'''Master Menace''' is a [[fiction]]al character from [[Marvel Comics]] who appears in two separate but related continuities, [[Squadron Supreme]] and [[Supreme Power]].

==Squadron Supreme==
Master Menace is a [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Doctor Doom]] analogue.
==Supreme Power==
Emil Burbank is a man with many aliases and possibly the greatest intellect on the planet. He has [[Doctoral]] Degrees in [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Metallurgy]], [[Psychology]], [[Economics]] and [[literature]]. From three different universites. As a child he sexually abused his older sister by drugging her unconscious with chemical compounds eventually leaving her in a permanent catatonic state. At 18 his parents died in a car accident, which he arranged and boasts about even while trying to say it was an accident. Emil is noted for pyromaniacal homocidal retribution against those he felt has wronged him. Both of those times, a school bully and a professor that accused him of cheating, ended with the persons caught in a fire Emil started. 

One may note the similarities between Emil Burbank and [[Lex Luthor]]. In DC's Post-Crisis continuity, Luthor was a young genius who did in fact arrange the death of his parents in car crash and began his empire using the life insurance policy that he took out on their lives. In DC's Pre-Crisis continuity, Luthor also had a sister named Lena and used multiple identities in the Superman novels written by [[Elliot S! Maggin]]. Emil Burbank's origin seems to be a combination of both interpretations of Lex Luthor.

It is noted that Emil's intellect may be a result of the retro-virus. Emil denies it, believing that his genius is his own doing. Immense intellect in humans is not unknown in history, such examples being Archimedes, Leonardo Da Vinci and Buckminster Fuller.
