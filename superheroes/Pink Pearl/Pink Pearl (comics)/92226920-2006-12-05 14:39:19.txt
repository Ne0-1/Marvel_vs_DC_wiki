Originally a member of a [[circus]] [[troupe]], Pink Pearl decided to become a terrorist and attempt to take over the circus.  An extremely large woman, her [[obesity]] enables her to have above-average strength and durability.  Her plan was to use a bomb to murder the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and the [[President of the United States]].  However, [[Northstar (comics)|Northstar]] and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] of [[Alpha Flight]] discovered her plans and eventually confronted the woman.  After a battle, Pearl was stabbed in the heart with one of her own ally's, a thin-man named Bones, daggers.  Due to her fat, she was able to survive the encounter, and later joined the villainess [[Superia]] on her cruise ship for female criminals.  As a member of the [[Femizons]], Pink Pearl went head-to-head with [[Captain America]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].  After the group's disbandment, Pink Pearl established herself as a business woman and opened a male [[strip club]] called "Cloisters."  Unfortunately for her, Aurora, [[Vindicator|Guardian]], and [[Diamond Lil]] were all patrons, and started a brawl.  Pink Pearl eventually got the trio of women arrested, and presumably still runs Cloisters.  It is interesting to note that Pink Pearl speaks in [[third-person]], and though comes across as being quite inadequate, she is quite intelligent and a formidable adversary.
