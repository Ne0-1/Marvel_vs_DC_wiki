'''Silhouette''' ('''Silhouette Chord''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]]. Silhouette and her brother [[Midnight's Fire]] are Mutates, their powers are derived from their ability to tap into the extra-dimensional energy of the ''Universal Wellspring'', due to exposure to the mutagenic properties of the "Well of All Things" while in the womb.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
In 1966 during the [[Vietnam War]], an American recon patrol in [[Cambodia]] stumbled upon an ancient, hidden [[temple]] of a cult kown as the Dragon's Breath, which had remained hidden for centuries. It had been built upon a well-spring of raw, primal energy called the "Well of All Things". The inhabitants decided to breed a superior race that would one day unite with the ways of the west. They believed that this union would produce children capable of harnessing the power of the Well. The members of the recon patrol were to be the fathers of these children; one of these men was Andrew Chord the man who would become Silhouette's father.[http://members.fortunecity.com/jsc2593/circle.html]

===Midnight's Fire===
Silhouette and her brother Midnight's Fire are the only children of [[Andrew Chord]], the former guardian of Dwayne Taylor ([[Night Thrasher]]) and his wife Miyami ([[Tai (comics)|Tai]]'s only daughter). Silhouette and Midnight's Fire were operating as independent vigilantes in the streets of [[New York City]], when they met Dwayne (before he had become Night Thrasher), and the three began an organized effort to take down various New York City [[street gangs]].

===Paralyzed===
This partnership ended when Silhouette was shot and [[paraplegic|paralyzed from the legs down]] in a sting gone wrong. Midnight's Fire blamed Dwayne, becoming a [[cop killer]] and [[druglord]] in order to lure Dwayne into a physical confrontation he could not possibly win. Later the partially paralyzed Silhouette reunited with Dwayne, distancing herself from her brother's evil actions.[http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2855/silhouette.html]

===Folding Circle and the Infinity Crusade===
Diego Casseas, one of the other members of the recon patrol, now calling himself the [[Left Hand (comics)|Left Hand]], stole the power of the Well from his own child, then gathered the other children of the pact into a group called the [[Folding Circle]]. The Circle attempted to take control of the Well away from Tai. Members of the Circle, together with the New Warriors, managed to defeat Tai, but the Well was sealed, Cassias and Tai were apparently killed, and the surviving members of the Circle escaped in a stolen Avengers' Quinjet.[http://members.fortunecity.com/jsc2593/circle.html] 

The remaining members of the Folding Circle later crashed in [[Madripoor]] and attempted to usurp the role of local drug-lord ([[Aardwolf (comics)|Aardwolf]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] crime-lord). They succeeded, but were later taken down by Night Thrasher and Silhouette. [http://members.fortunecity.com/jsc2593/circle.html]

It was around this time Silhouette became the brainwashed assistant/bodyguard to the cosmic villain ''Goddess'' in the limited series [[Infinity Crusade]]. She saves most of the cosmos from the power-mad fantasies of [[Pip the Troll]], unfortunately just in time for the homicidal fantasies of the Goddess to prevail. The Goddess ends up defeated by other forces.

===Night Thrasher===
For a time, Silhouette and Night Thrasher were lovers; in fact, Dwayne had been in love with her for a very long time, but his anger and single-minded obsession with his "mission" eventually pushed her away. Silhouette later hooked up with Dwayne's half-brother [[Bandit (comics)|Bandit]], and they both left the team after the events in New Warriors #51.

===Bandit===
Silhouette and Bandit moved to [[Chicago]] together, and for a long time, nothing was heard from either of them until Bandit showed up in [[New Orleans]], attempting to con [[Belladonna (comics)|Belladonna]] into helping him destroy the Thieves Guild. It is during this story that [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] reveals the fact that Bandit and Silhouette are still together, and that he was only manipulating Belladonna. The Guild was destroyed and Bandit left New Orleans and presumably returned to Chicago.

===Universal Wellspring===
Silhouette is a [[Mutate (comics)|Mutate]] like her brother [[Midnight's Fire]]. Her powers come from the ''Universal Wellspring'' as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #107.

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
Silhouette has recently re-emerged as a member of [[Captain America]]'s "Secret Avengers," declaring her stance against the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]]. In ''[[Iron Man]]'' #14; Silhouette is part of the backup team when Iron Man wants to meet Captain America on the field at Yankee Stadium, at night when it is empty. During the meeting, all the stadium's lights turn on at once. While Stature, Spider-Man and Luke Cage attack Iron Man, Silhouette takes Captain America away via the shadows.

Silhouette has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
*Silhouette has the ability to manipulate the [[Darkforce]], but on a more limited level than most other Darkforce wielders in the Marvel Universe. 
*Like [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Silhouette originally had the power to shadow-meld, thereby becoming nearly invisible while under the cover of darkness, as well as the ability to teleport via dimension hop, using any available shadow as a portal. She could also open small portals anywhere shadows existed and use them to attack distant enemies by extending her crutches through them.
*After a disturbance in the Darkforce that affected everyone who used it, she found that her powers had increased to the point where she could now teleport others. She has demonstrated this ability by teleporting small groups of people along with herself, although it is painful and leaves her exhausted. She can also now become 'living darkness', and can cause extreme pain by phasing through the bodies of her enemies. [http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2855/silhouette.html]
*Like her brother Midnight's Fire, Silhouette also has enhanced speed, strength, agility, and sensory perception. She is a capable martial artist.
*After she was paralyzed, Night Thrasher designed and built a special pair of combat-capable [[crutches]] and [[leg braces]] for her. Thrash designed the crutches to include both a hidden electric [[tazer]] and a slim injector that delivered paralytic chemicals. 
*A later design had retractable braces in specially designed open metal gauntlets. 
*She wears a costume made from [[unstable molecules]], because early on, her clothes fell off whenever she shadow-melted.
