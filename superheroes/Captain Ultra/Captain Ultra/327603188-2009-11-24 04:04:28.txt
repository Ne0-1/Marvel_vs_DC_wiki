'''Captain Ultra''' ('''Griffin Gogol''') is a [[fictional character]], a comedic [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].   He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #177 (December 1976) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[George Pérez]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].

Captain Ultra was also one of the aliases used by [[Nextwave]] member The [[Captain (comics)|Captain]].

==Fictional character biography==
When an elderly psychologist couldn't afford to pay plumber Griffin Gogol, he offers to cure Gogol's smoking habit via hypnosis. However, as Gogol later learned, the psychologist was an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]], and the hypnosis unlocks Gogol's innate superhuman potential. Donning a clashing, colorful costume, Gogol became the superhero Captain Ultra; however, it is revealed he suffers from severe [[pyrophobia]] (fear of fire). 

Captain Ultra's first appearance is as an applicant to the [[supervillain]] team called the [[Frightful Four]]; he is at first enthusiastically accepted by the other three villains, ecstatic at his large array of powers. However, when one of them began to light a [[cigarette]] in celebration, Captain Ultra faints in the presence of the [[matchstick|match]]; he is promptly rejected.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #177</ref>

An unauthorized television program informs Gogol of the super-hero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Captain Ultra is one of a large group to investigate by traveling to the Richmond Riding Academy on Long Island. There he works with a small group to stop a crime spree back in New York. Like most of the other applicants, he is not pleased with the Defenders and never really petitions the core group for membership.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-64</ref>

Soon after, he moves to Chicago. He has since had a minor career as a solo superhero, often teaming up with heroes like [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to battle minor villains.<ref>''Thor'' #336</ref>

He eventually overcomes his pathological fear of fire thanks to years of extensive [[psychotherapy|therapy]] under the superpowered psychiatrist, [[Doc Samson]]. Gogol began a new career as a stand-up comedian, and battled Ekl'r, the Demon Without Humor.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #50</ref> His comedy career takes him across the country. Super-heroics interfere with this, such as when the underground dirt creature 'Mud Pi', kidnaps his entire potential audience, the citenzry of 'Wash Basin', [[Texas]]. Captain Ultra manages to safely rescue them all. <ref>''Marvel Holiday Special'' 1993</ref>

===The Initiative===
Griffin then became the leader for the [[Nebraska]] team of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program, part of a government controlled superhero program. After [[Paragon (comics)#Paragon (Cooper Roth)|Paragon]], one of his team, kills fellow teammate Gadget, Griffin briefly fights [[Iron Man]] to protect the rest of his group<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #22</ref> He is seen investigating the circumstances of Paragon and Gadget's tragic deaths with Doc Samson and Iron Man. During the course of their investigation it is revealed that there are two new Initiative recruits in the process of being fast-tracked to the Nebraska team, although Captain Ultra expressed irritation at the prospect of having to "babysit the punks".<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #24</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Ultra's powers were released through hypnosis by an alien, giving him the power of flight, [[superhuman]] strength, endurance, durability, and reflexes. He also gained the psionic ability to become intangible at will, see through substances ([[X-ray]] vision), and the ability to project his breath forward with great concussive force — among others. He can apparently tap his 'ultra-potential', enabling him to manifest a wide variety of mental and physical 'ultra-feats', and once even told an 'ultra-joke'.

==In other media==
===Television===
Captain Ultra made a cameo appearance in the 2006 ''[[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' TV series episode "The Cure."  In that episode, [[Ben Grimm]]'s "condition" had been cured, and the team was auditioning possible replacements. In a scene reminiscent of his introduction with the Frightful Four, Captain Ultra was considered a top candidate for his powers until [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] "lit up" his thumb while giving a thumbs-up gesture, causing Captain Ultra to faint and be summarily rejected.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Cure | episodelink = The Cure (Fantastic Four) | series = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | serieslink = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | airdate = 2007-06-09 | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref>
