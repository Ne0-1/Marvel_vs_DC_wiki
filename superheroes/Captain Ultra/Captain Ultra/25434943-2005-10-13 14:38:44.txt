'''Captain Ultra''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a [[parody]] of [[DC Comics]]' [[Martian Manhunter]].  He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #177 (December, [[1976]]).

Captain Ultra (real name Griffin Gogol) has the power of flight, [[superhuman]] strength and endurance, and [[X-ray]] vision.  He was originally pathologically afraid of [[fire]]; he eventually overcame this limitation thanks to years of extensive [[therapy]] under [[Doc Samson]].

Captain Ultra first appeared as an applicant to the [[supervillain]] team called the [[Frightful Four]]; he was rejected when he fainted in the presence of a lit [[matchstick|match]].  He later applied to the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  He has since had a minor career as a solo superhero, often teaming up with heroes like [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to battle minor villains.
