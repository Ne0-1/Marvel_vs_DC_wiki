'''Captain Ultra''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].   He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #177 (December, [[1976]]).

==Character biography==

Captain Ultra (real name Griffin Gogol) has the power of flight, [[superhuman]] strength and endurance, and [[X-ray]] vision.  He was originally pathologically afraid of [[fire]]; he eventually overcame this limitation thanks to years of extensive [[psychotherapy|therapy]] under [[Doc Samson]].{{cn}}  This marks him as a parody of the [[Martian Manhunter]].{{cn}}

Captain Ultra first appeared as an applicant to the [[supervillain]] team called the [[Frightful Four]]; he was at first enthusiastically accepted by the other three villains, ecstatic at his large array of powers.  However, when one of them began to light a [[cigarette]] in celebration, he fainted in the presence of the [[matchstick|match]]; he was promptly rejected.  He later applied to the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  He has since had a minor career as a solo superhero, often teaming up with heroes like [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to battle minor villains.  He also does [[stand-up comedy]] and once worked as a plumber.
