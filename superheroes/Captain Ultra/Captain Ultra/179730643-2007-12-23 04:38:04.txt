'''Captain Ultra''' ('''Griffin Gogol''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].   He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #177 (December [[1976]]) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[George Perez]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].

Captain Ultra was also one of the aliases used by The [[Captain (comics)|Captain]].

==Fictional character biography==
When an elderly psychologist couldn't afford to pay plumber Griffin Gogol, he offered to cure Gogol's smoking habit via hypnosis. However, as Gogol later learned, the psychologist was an [[extraterrestrial]], and the hypnosis unlocked Gogol's innate superhuman potential. Donning a staggeringly gaudy costume, Gogol became the superhero Captain Ultra; however, he suffered from severe [[pyrophobia]] (fear of fire). 

Captain Ultra's first appearance was as an applicant to the [[supervillain]] team called the [[Frightful Four]]; he was at first enthusiastically accepted by the other three villains, ecstatic at his large array of powers. However, when one of them began to light a [[cigarette]] in celebration, he fainted in the presence of the [[matchstick|match]]; he was promptly rejected.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #177</ref>

An unauthorized television program told of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Captain Ultra was one of a large group to investigate by traveling to the Richmond Riding Academy on Long Island. There he worked with a small group to stop a crime spree back in New York. Like most of the other applicants, he was not pleased with the Defenders and never really petitioned the core group for membership.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-64</ref>

Soon after, he would move to Chicago. He has since had a minor career as a solo superhero, often teaming up with heroes like [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to battle minor villains.<ref>''Thor'' #336</ref>

He eventually overcame his pathological fear of fire thanks to years of extensive [[psychotherapy|therapy]] under [[Doc Samson]]. Gogol began a new career as a stand-up comedian, and battled Ekl'r, the Demon Without Humor.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #50</ref>

===The Initiative===
Griffin was the team leader for the [[Nebraska]] team of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program. After [[Paragon (comics)#Cooper Roth|Paragon]], one of his team, killed fellow teammate [[Gadget (comics)|Gadget]], Griffin briefly fought [[Iron Man]] to protect the remainder of his team. It is unknown whether or not his status as team leader has been changed as a result of this incident.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #22</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Ultra's powers were released through hypnosis by an alien, giving him the power of flight, [[superhuman]] strength, endurance, durability, and reflexes. He also gained the psionic ability to become intangible at will, see through substances ([[X-ray]] vision), and the ability to project his breath forward with great concussive force â€” among others. He can apparently tap his 'ultra-potential', enabling him to manifest a wide variety of mental and physical 'ultra-feats', and once even told an 'ultra-joke'.

==In other media==
===Television===
Captain Ultra made a cameo appearance in the 2006 [[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)|Fantastic Four]] TV series episode "The Cure."  In that episode, [[Ben Grimm]]'s "condition" had been cured, and the team was auditioning possible replacements. In a scene reminiscent of his introduction with the Frightful Four, Captain Ultra was considered a top candidate for his powers until [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] "lit up" his thumb while giving a thumbs-up gesture, causing Captain Ultra to faint and be summarily rejected.<ref name="F4 Youtube">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfh4WRqZU-k YouTube link to the episode in question]</ref>
