'''Nuidis Vulko''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] character and one of the most recurring members of the [[Aquaman]] supporting cast. He was created by [[Bob Haney]] and [[Sal Trapani]] in ''The Brave and the Bold #73'' in 1967. His look was redesigned by [[Nick Cardy]] for ''Aquaman #35''.

==Fictional character biography==

Vulko is the chief scientific adviser of Atlantis and is probably its most notorious political and academic figure (he has been involved in most of the political changes and revolution the city has gone through since he first appeared). He has been called Doctor, professor, commander and he even became king of Atlantis in the Earth-2 continuity. He knew Aquaman's mother and was an advisor to King Trevis. He was present at Aquaman's birth, and argued against leaving Aquaman to die, claiming the curse of Kordax was a silly superstition. 

Chronologically, he later befriends Aquaman when both were held in an Atlantean prison. After Aquaman frees himself and gains his throne, he makes Vulko his regent.<ref>{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-x|page=18}}</ref>
