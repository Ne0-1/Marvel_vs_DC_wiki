'''Gillian B. Loeb''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Batman]]'' #404, as part of the ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' storyarc. 

==History==
Loeb is introduced as the [[police commissioner|commissioner]] of [[Gotham City]]'s [[Gotham City Police Department|Police Department]] at about the time Batman begins his war on crime. He is corrupted under the influence of [[Carmine Falcone]] and immediately considers then-Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]'s honesty a threat. However, he does not immediately share the same opinion about Batman, since the masked [[vigilante]] is targeting only low level criminals, and is popular with the public. One night, however, Batman attacks his house during a dinner party, which includes guests from Gotham's criminal underworld, and publicly announces that he intends to bring them down as well.

Enraged, Loeb orders Gordon to arrest Batman immediately.  However, the vigilante proves frustratingly elusive, until one night in which the police corner him in an abandoned building following an impromptu rescue on the street. Loeb orders a [[bomb]] dropped on the building and a [[SWAT]] unit conducting an armed search of the rubble. As morning breaks, however, Batman escapes, much to Loeb's aggravation.

When Gordon begins surreptitiously helping Batman, Loeb [[blackmail]]s him with evidence of his extramarital affair with Sgt. [[Sarah Essen]].

Eventually, Batman, Gordon, and [[District Attorney]] [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] expose Loeb's ties to the Falcone mob, and he is forced to resign. Another corrupt officer, Jack Grogan, replaces him. Gordon becomes the department's commissioner a few years later.

In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', Loeb returns, hoping to use the [[Hangman (DC Comics)|Hangman]] killings as an excuse to try to get the city council to remove Gordon from his position as commissioner.  His overall goal is to regain his former position, and justifies taking over due to his "experience".  However, before his plans can be fulfilled, he becomes a victim of the Hangman Killer himself.

==Appearances in other media==
Loeb appears in the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and its 2008 sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. He is played by British actor [[Colin McFarlane]] in both films. Though shown to be at odds with Batman—launching a police task force to arrest him—Loeb is portrayed more sympathetically in the films, with no indications that he is corrupt or under the influence of Carmine Falcone. Loeb is killed in ''The Dark Knight'' when he drinks from a [[Joker venom|liquor bottle that actually contains acid planted]] by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. After Loeb's death, Mayor Garcia promotes James Gordon to the vacant post of Police Commissioner. Unlike in the comics, the Loeb in Nolan's universe is an African American.

In ''The Dark Knight'' movie novelization, Loeb's full name is given as Perry Loeb rather than Gillian Loeb. In ''The Dark Knight'' [[viral marketing|viral campaign]], however, he is referred to as Gillian B. Loeb, as in the comics. Loeb's first name is given as "Joseph" in [[Matt Wagner]]'s limited-series comic ''[[Batman and the Monster Men]]'' (2005-2006), a likely reference to writer [[Jeph Loeb]], whose first name is Joseph.
