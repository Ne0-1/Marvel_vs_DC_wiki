'''Gillian B. Loeb''' was the [[fictitious]] [[Gotham City]] [[police commissioner]] in the [[DC Universe]] in the [[story arc]], ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. 

He was ranked above Detective [[Jim Gordon]] and his partner, Flass. He was thoroughly corrupt and found Gordon's honesty most troubling for his operation. However, he did not immediately share the same opinion about the mysterious [[vigilante]], [[Batman]], since he thought the masked man was targeting only low level criminals which he thought was politically advantageous. However, Batman attacked his residence during a dinner party with his criminal and political contacts and publicly announced that he fully intended to bring them down as well.

With that threat, Loeb ordered Gordon to arrest Batman immediately.  However, the vigilante proved frustratingly elusive until a impromptu rescue on the street led to him being cornered in an abandoned building. Although the situation seemed hopeless with the police surrounding the building, the commissioner ordering a [[bomb]] dropped on it and a [[SWAT]] conducting an armed search of the rubble as morning was breaking, Batman still escaped, much to Loeb's aggravation.

Eventually, Batman's investigations, Gordon's resistance to Loeb's attempts to cow him and [[District Attorney]] [[Harvey Dent]]'s prosecution of Flass, who divulged damaging evidence, forced Loeb to resign. Gordon replaced him a few years later.
 
Commissioner Loeb appears in ''[[Batman Begins]]'', played by English actor [[Colin McFarlane]]. The character is [[African-American]] and there is no indication that he is corrupt. Many fans believe that this portrayal is more akin to the current Commissioner in the comic series Commissioner Atkins, due to McFarlane's ethnicity, appearance and manner.
