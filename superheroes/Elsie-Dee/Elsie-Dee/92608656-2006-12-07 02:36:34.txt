'''Elsie-Dee''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]], and an ally of [[Wolverine]]. The character first appeared in ''Wolverine'' Vol. 2, Issue 37 in an inanimate state suspended in tank of gelatin. Elsie-Dee is a [[sentient]] automaton or android. Her name is a pun on [[LCD]], indicating her artificial origins.

==Fictional character biography==
Elsie-Dee was created along with her counterpart, [[Albert (comics)|Albert]] (a robot double of Wolverine), by [[Donald Pierce]]. These [[android]]s were designed to kill Wolverine. The Wolverine double was to act as the bait and Elsie-Dee (who outwardly appears to be a 5 year old girl) was to trap Wolverine in a burning building were she would detonate with sufficient force to kill him. 

The plan failed because one of Pierces' [[Reavers (comics)|henchmen]], Bonebreaker, accidentally gave Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence one of Pierce's automatons was capable of, instead of the intended intellect of a 5 year old. As a result Elsie-Dee eventually found a way to defuse her detonation sequence and enhanced the primitive intelligence of her counterpart, giving him intelligence beyond even hers. Having met Wolverine, she and her counterpart decided that he was a noble person and did not deserve to die and consequently abandoned their mission.

The two robots risked their existences several times for each other and for Wolverine. At some point they travelled in time and had several adventures. Their current whereabouts are unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Though appearing to be a 5 year old girl, Elsie-Dee had abilities far exceeding her appearance. She was very strong, could interface directly with computers, and had an intellect greater than her designer, Donald Pierce, who was himself a genius in the field of robotics.
