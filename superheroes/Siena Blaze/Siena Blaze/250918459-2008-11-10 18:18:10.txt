'''Siena Blaze''' (also spelled '''Sienna Blaze''') is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] villain in the [[Marvel Comic]]'s [[X-Men]] comics series. While she was a villain in the Marvel universe, she became a hero in the [[Ultraverse]].

==Fictional character biography==
Siena Blaze originally started out as a member of the thrillseeking [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a group of mutants who hunted other mutants for sport. She participates in several confrontations with members of the [[X-Men]], such as confronting [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]]. There is a later incident in [[Antarctica]] where she battles a stranded Cyclops, Professor Xavier and Storm<ref>"X-Men Unlimited" #1</ref>. She almost kills the trio with an explosion.

Later she is transported to the Ultraverse along with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]], where she is a member of the heroic [[Exiles (Malibu Comics)|Exiles]] (not to be confused with the current [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|team of reality hopping heroes]]). Surprisingly, Siena adapts to the role of hero quite well. She feels a strong attraction to team leader [[Warstrike (comics)|Warstrike]]. Eventually she, along with Juggernaut and Reaper, are returned to the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]]. Afterwards Siena vanished from sight for years, until she meets her apparent death at the [[Weapon X]] Neverland [[concentration camp]].

==Powers and abilities==
Siena Blaze has the power to fire deadly force blasts of [[electromagnetic]] energy. When she fires these blasts, she literally rips apart large sections of the Earth's magnetic field, and causes localized ecological disasters. Siena does not seem to care that using her blasts could destroy the ecosystems of the entire planet. She also can manipulate magnetic fields to inhibit other mutants from [[Teleportation|teleporting]]. She can surround herself with an aura of magnetic energy with equal polarity to the Earth's [[geomagnetic]] field, causing the Earth to repel her upwards, and enabling her to fly via [[magnetic levitation]]. She can also teleport vast distances by turning herself into magnetic energy, and turning back at a desired location.

==In other media==
===X-Men 2: Gamesmaster's Legacy===
In the [[video game]] ''[[X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy|X-Men 2: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]'' for [[Sega Game Gear]], Siena Blaze appears as a boss in the second level, the Arctic.
