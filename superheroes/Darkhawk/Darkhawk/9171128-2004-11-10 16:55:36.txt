[[Darkhawk]] (Chris Powell) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[universe]].  While spying on his father at an abandoned amusement park, Chris discovered a mysterious [[amulet]] that, with concentration, transformed him into a powerful android.  Suspicious that his father, a policeman, was accepting bribes from a crime boss, Chris vowed to use the amulet as "an edge against crime."  In this role, Darkhawk occasionally worked with the [[New Warriors]] and was a provisional member of the [[West Coast Avengers]].

In his original form, Darkhawk's powers include "darkforce blasts" which emanate from the amulet on his chest; a small energy shield from the same source; a grappling claw on one arm; retractable gliding wings; and night vision.  Darkhawk's face, covered by a [[helmet]], is intensely ugly or terrifying, a feature that can be used to stun enemies.  When the android body was damaged, Chris could heal it almost instantly by transforming into his human form, and then back into his android form again.  (Injuries to Chris's human form could not be healed this way.)

Chris discovered that the source of his powers was a living vessel in deep space, where his and other Darkhawk bodies were stored and repaired; when Chris was Darkhawk, his human body was stored in the ship in the android's place.  Upon making this discovery, Chris obtained a new android form with a variety of new powers, including a more powerful shield that could take any shape and the ability to fly rather than glide.

In recent cameo appearances (since the cancellation of his own series), Darkhawk appears in his original form.
