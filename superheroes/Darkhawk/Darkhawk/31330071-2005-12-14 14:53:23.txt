'''Darkhawk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[universe]].  He was co-created by writer [[Danny Fingeroth]] and artist [[Mike Manley]]. However many claim [[Tom DeFalco]] was also a co-creator.

==Character biography==

While spying on his father at an abandoned amusement park, teenager Chris Powell discovered a mysterious [[amulet]] that, with concentration, transformed him into a powerful [[android]].  Suspicious that his father, a policeman, was accepting bribes from a crime boss, Chris vowed to use the amulet as "an edge against crime."  In this role, Darkhawk occasionally worked with the [[New Warriors]] and was a provisional member of the [[West Coast Avengers]]. Currently, Chris has decided to 'retire' from superheroics and has joined a support group of former teen heroes, under the name [[Excelsior]].  However, Chris has become Darkhawk once more, for a special mission for Excelsior; in which the team are trying to help the teen super-heroes known as the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]. With the completion of this mission, Darkhawk again appears to be an active superhero on the west coast.

In his original form, Darkhawk's powers include "darkforce blasts" which emanate from the amulet on his chest, a small energy shield from the same source, a grappling claw on one arm, retractable gliding wings and night vision.  Darkhawk's face, covered by a [[helmet]], is intensely ugly or terrifying, a feature that can be used to stun enemies.  When the android body was damaged, Chris could heal it almost instantly by transforming into his human form, and then back into his android form again (injuries to Chris's human form could not be healed this way).

Chris discovered that the source of his powers was a living vessel in deep space, where his and other Darkhawk bodies were stored and repaired. When Chris was Darkhawk, his human body was stored in the ship in the android's place (a feature found also in the [[Miracleman]] comic).  Upon making this discovery, Chris obtained a new android form with a variety of new powers, including a more powerful shield that could take any shape and the ability to fly rather than glide.

In recent cameo appearances (since the cancellation of his own series), Darkhawk appears in his original form.

==Excelsior==

{{Spoiler}}

Recently, Chris Powell had joined Excelsior, a group for former teenage heroes who were struggling with their current lot in life. Members of this group included Phil Urich (a former [[Green Goblin]]), [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] from the [[New Warriors]], Julie Power from [[Power Pack]], and Ricochet from the [[Slingers]]. The group was hired by a mysterious benefactor to track down a group of young runaways in Los Angeles. 

Chris displayed trouble controlling his anger in his Darkhawk persona, leading to a short skirmish with Turbo. Dismayed with himself, Chris decided to never turn into Darkhawk again. This decision did not last long however, as shortly thereafter the group battled the notorious [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] villain, [[Ultron]]. Darkhawk delivered the final blow, using a darkforce blast at point blank range to blow Ultron to pieces. 

==Powers and abilities==
As Darkhawk, Christopher Powell has enhanced strength; entailing that he can lift in the range between 900 pounds and 2 tons. His agility and reflexes are similarly enhanced and he is also capable of a flight capacity which is somewhat faster than a natural winged flight limit. He can also glide on air currents simply using the wings of his costume. As Darkhawk, Powell can also regenerate large portions of tissue and even vital organs and limbs. To heal himself Darkhawk must temporarilly revert to his vulnerable human form.

Using his amulet he can project concussive "Darkforce" blasts from his body and can surround himself with an invisible defensive force shield. Darkhawk also has telescopic and infra-red vision.  In human form he has none of these abilities.

Aside from his superhuman powers, Powell is a an expert in the martial art of [[Kendo]]. As Darkhawk he carries a grappling hook on his right hand shaped like a claw, similar to [[Wolverine]].

In the last year of his series, Chris had his mind copied to the android body so he could exist as both beings simultaneously. Darkhawk then has his amulet accidentally reprogrammed, and found himself in a more powerful incarnation with different powers: shapeable energy shield, eyeblasts, access to spaceship computer, teleport hand-guns from the ship, and one expendable claw on each hand. Although Darkhawk could no longer switch with Chris, he could still recover using a self-generated healing pod.  Combining all of his powers, Darkhawk could produce a gigantic hawk construct with devastating power. Later he remerged with his human self. If he retains any of these abilities, or how he reverted to his original form is unknown. However, this reversion to his original form may somehow be connected to a battle Darkhawk was forced to fight in by Morgan Le Fay, who scooped him right out of Chronopolis during a mission which was actually happening in an issue of Darkhawk, and then battled the Avengers. Thus, it may may that there are two Darkhawks running around. In addition, how and when Darkhawk moved to the west coast is unknown, as Darkhawk had lived on the East Coast in New York City throughout the entire 50 issue run, withonly two appearances on the west coast. Once in West Coast avengers, and again in his own book, where he demonstarted the ability to fly cross-country with only a brief stop to 'recharge', meaning he literally flew from New York to California in a single night.
