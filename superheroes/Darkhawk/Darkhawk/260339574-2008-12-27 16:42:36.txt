==Fictional character biography==
Christopher Powell was born in [[Queens, New York]]. While witnessing his policeman father accept a bribe from a crime boss at an abandoned amusement park, teenager Chris Powell discovered a mysterious [[amulet]]. This amulet allowed him to switch places with a powerful [[android]] that his mind controlled. Chris vowed to use the amulet as "an edge against crime."<ref>''Darkhawk'' #1</ref> In this role, he worked with other superheroes and battled a number of costumed villains.

Darkhawk soon encountered his first supervillain, the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]], and battled him alongside [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Darkhawk'' #2-3</ref> He next fought [[Savage Steel]],<ref>''Darkhawk'' #4</ref>  and then [[Portal (comics)|Portal]].<ref>''Darkhawk'' #5</ref> He next battled the [[U-Foes]] alongside [[Captain America]].<ref>''Darkhawk'' #6</ref> He battled the villain [[Lodestone (comics)|Lodestone]], who attempted to remove his amulet.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #8</ref> He battled Savage Steel again, this time alongside the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Darkhawk'' #9</ref> Darkhawk battled the cyborg [[Midnight (Marvel Comics)|Midnight]], [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]], and the [[Secret Empire]] alongside Spider-Man, the Punisher, [[Night Thrasher]], [[Nova (comics)|Nova]], and [[Moon Knight]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #353-358</ref> Darkhawk then battled assassins from the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]]'s 1400 Club.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #10</ref> He battled [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], who successfully removed his amulet from his chest.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #11</ref>

Darkhawk occasionally worked with the [[New Warriors]] and was a provisional member of the [[West Coast Avengers]]. Darkhawk also battled a number of costumed villains, including the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].  

Originally, Darkhawk's powers included force blasts and flat energy shields projected from the amulet in his chest; a set of three claws on his right arm that extended as a grappling hook (often referred to as a 'claw cable'); retractable gliding wings and enhanced vision, including night and telescopic vision. Darkhawk's face, covered by a [[helmet]], is apparently intensely ugly or terrifying. While never revealed to the reader, nearly every character that has seen Darkhawk's face has been horrified by it. When the android body was damaged, Chris could heal it almost instantly by transforming into his human form, and then back into his android form again. Darkhawk originally glided through the air using his wings, but later gained the power of flight, a power which later carried over to his upgraded form.

[[Image:Darkhawk2ndcostume.jpg|170px|thumb|left|Darkhawk's second armor. Art by [[Ron Lim]].]] Chris discovered that the armor was stored and repaired aboard a starship in a dimension called Null Space. When he used the amulet to access the armor, his human body switched places with the armor. The Darkhawk amulet and armor were one of several commissioned by an alien crime lord named [[Evilhawk|Dargin Bokk]]. The scientists who created the technology eventually used it to assault Bokk. After Bokk's defeat, the Darkhawk amulet was sent to Earth for safekeeping.

Later, Chris and Darkhawk were split into two separate beings, each with Chris' memories. The Darkhawk body was then transformed into a new shape when it accidentally downloaded data from the ship.

The new Darkhawk body had a single, extendable blade on each wrist replacing his claw cable, camouflage, the ability to project force blasts from his helmet's visor in addition to his amulet, and a powerful forcefield that could change its shape. The forcefield could be used in tandem with his forceblasts to make constructs similar to the effects of [[Green Lantern]]'s power ring. Darkhawk could also teleport weapons out of the ship's arsenal to himself instantaneously.

Chris and Darkhawk later merged so that Chris could change back and forth between the two without teleporting to Null Space.

===Excelsior (Loners)===
Chris later joined Excelsior, a group for former teenage superheroes who were struggling with their current lot in life. Members of this group included [[Phil Urich]] (a former Green Goblin), [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] from the [[New Warriors]], [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] from [[Power Pack]], and [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] from the [[Slingers]]. The group was hired by a mysterious benefactor - later revealed to be former Avengers sidekick and Captain Marvel partner [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] - to track down a group of young [[Runaways (comics)|runaways]] in Los Angeles. 

Chris displayed trouble controlling his anger in his Darkhawk persona, leading to a short skirmish with Turbo. Dismayed with himself, Chris decided to never turn into Darkhawk again. This decision did not last long however, as shortly thereafter the group battled the notorious [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] villain, [[Ultron]]. Darkhawk delivered the final blow, using a darkforce blast at point blank range to blow Ultron to pieces. Following the battle and the revelation of Jones' involvement, Excelsior opted to remain together and act as a more traditional superhero team.

Recently, Excelsior has decided to become a superhero support group due to the events of the superhuman [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. However, their newest member [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] has convinced Chris to use his powers, in order to help her take down the [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]] dealers that moved to Los Angeles.

===Secret Invasion===
Deciding to register with the government, Darkhawk is assigned to the position of Security Chief at [[Project Pegasus|Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.]]. During the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]], he teams up with his old team-mate [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]<ref>''Nova'' #17</ref>.

===War of Kings===
Darkhawk will be involved within the War of Kings Event, with a two issue miniseries called ''War of Kings: Darkhawk'', focusing upon dealing with his past.[http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=11024][http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=11241]

==Powers and abilities==
The Darkhawk body has enhanced physical abilities, including strength, agility and reflexes, powered by the extraterrestrial amulet he wears. The retractable glider wings under his arms allow him to glide on air currents, and he can also fly at speeds that let him fly from New York to California in only a matter of hours. Even major injuries to his Darkhawk body can be repaired by switching back to his human form; his Darkhawk body teleports back to its holding space on the Darkhawk ship in Null Space, where it can be repaired almost instantly. As the Darkhawk body is no longer separate from Chris and does not teleport to Null Space when not in use, it is questionable whether it can be repaired as quickly as it once was.

Darkhawk can project energy from the amulet in his chest as a focal point, either as concussive force blasts, or as a circular energy shield; (Chris referred to his force blasts as "darkforce blasts," until he encountered the actual [[Darkforce]] Dimension in [[New Warriors]]). Darkhawk also has telescopic and infra-red vision, and a grappling hook claw-cable on his right arm shaped like a claw.

In his human form, Chris Powell has no superhuman abilities, though he has taken some [[karate]] and [[kendo]] classes.

For a time, Darkhawk was upgraded to a new body design, which gave him greatly enhanced powers. His amulet could project force bubbles in various shapes and he could combine his force fields and force blasts into a giant, hawk-shaped construct around his body. He could fire heat beams from his eyes, be healed by generating an energy pod around his body, and had a single extendable claw on each wrist. He could also mentally communicate with the Darkhawk ship, and could teleport weapons from the ship when he was on Earth. At one point, he was outfitted with additional body armor on top of his android body.  

In this body, he was separated from Chris Powell, and also retained Chris' memories. The two were later merged into one being in the final issue of the Darkhawk series, so that Chris could turn into Darkhawk on command. The Darkhawk android body no longer existed and the two separate entities became one.

At some point after the cancellation of his own series, Darkhawk reverted to his original form under unrevealed circumstances, although he can still summon his second armored form. No explanation was given about that fact, causing an inconsistency in Darkhawk's continuity. The reason for the change seems to be for recognition. The popularity of Darkhawk's comic waned prior to the costume change, therefore his original outfit is the one associated with the character.

Darkhawk has two major weaknesses though.  If the continuity is basing itself on his first costume, then if his amulet is separated from his body in Darkhawk mode, then he will perish after the energy housed in his android form is completely released.  His second weakness is that his body is capable of being hacked by technological means.  These flaws were exposed during Darkhawk's first and second major story arcs, their penultimate issues being #25 and #50.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Darkhawk appears as a member of Wolfpack.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref>

===''U.S. War Machine''===
In the mini-series ''U.S. War Machine'', set in an alternate universe, Darkhawk was a psychopathic android, which could only be controlled by running a virtual reality program. The program, a "fiction" within that universe, played out the events where Darkhawk had been a member of the West Coast Avengers within normal Marvel continuity. The program itself also appeared in the final pages of ''US War Machine 2.0'' in which [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s damaged body is placed inside the Darkhawk program in order to keep him alive.

===''[[Marvel Team-Up]]: League of Losers''===
Darkhawk features in an arc of [[Robert Kirkman]]'s ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 3), featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed "The League of Losers". A group of heroes including Darkhawk, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], [[Araña]], [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], [[X-23]], [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]] and [[Terror Inc.|Terror]] (although Araña dies along the way) go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing [[Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]]' time machine, Chronok having come to the present and already having killed all of Marvel's major heroes. 

It's revealed that Chronok is from the same time period as Kirkman's [[Mutant 2099]]; the group stays with him and his mentor Reed Richards to wait for Chronok. The team defeats Chronok, but at the end of the story, Richards reveals they can't go back to their present, due to time-travel and alternate timelines. The group decides to stay in the future, satisfied with the impact they made, however unnoticed. Mutant 2099 suggests reforming the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] or the "Fantastic Nine". Effectively trapped in the future, Chris begins a romantic relationship with Dagger.

Note that due to the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|method for resolving time travel paradoxes]], this story occurred in an alternate universe. 

Over the course of this adventure, Chris acts as the core of the "League", serving as their leader and training the mostly novice heroes for their encounter with Chronok. Reed Richards remarks that while he had never thought of Darkhawk as leader material in the past, he is impressed by Chris' efforts.

During the various battles with Chronok and his army, Chris did not appear prone to irrational violence or uncontrollable anger while in his Darkhawk form, as he had during Excelsior's encounter with the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].

==In other media==
===Television===
Darkhawk made two brief cameos in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' cartoon. In the episode, "To Battle the Living Planet" he is seen with other New Warriors helping civilians. In "Doomsday" he is shown flying with [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]].

===Video games===
In the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]] video game, Spider-Man can be heard mocking the [[Human Torch]] during one of their races, stating "Darkhawk is faster than you!"
