The '''Demon Bear''' is a fictional villain featured in the [[comic book]] series ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'', both published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
An unknown villain created the Demon Bear by demonically mutating William and Peg Lonestar.<ref name="NM1920"/> The Demon Bear haunted the dreams of their daughter [[Danielle Moonstar]], claiming he had killed her parents and would eventually come and kill her.<ref>''New Mutants'' #3 and 17</ref>

Increasingly troubled by her dreams of the Demon Bear, Moonstar (then called Mirage) ran various Danger Room scenarios against bears, and then confronted the demon alone; he mauled her and severely damaged her spine.<ref>''New Mutants'' #18</ref> The New Mutants rushed her to the Mid-County Medical Center. The Demon Bear infiltrated the hospital, transported the team to the Badlands, and turned nurse [[Sharon Friedlander]] and officer [[Tom Corsi]] into demonic Native American warriors under his control. They later reverted to normal humans, but still kept the appearance of Native Americans. Here the New Mutants fought and defeated the Demon Bear, disrupting him with [[Magik (comics)|Magik's]] [[Soulsword]]. Danielle's parents leapt from his body, returning them to normal.<ref name="NM1920">"New Mutants" #19-20</ref>

The Demon Bear reappeared to battle [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], who was on his way to visit his brother's grave. Warpath fought the bear and would have been killed were it not for the intervention of [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], who offered his assistance against the demon. They found out that it is actually the corrupted form of the Apaches' animal spirits, who had been driven mad by [[Eli Bard]], who used a dagger full of black magic to do so.<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' (vol.3) #8</ref>

The Demon Bear later appears in possession of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], before being driven out by [[Psylocke]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' (vol. 2) #4-5</ref> Once Bishop is freed, Psylocke takes on the now docile bear as a companion.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' (vol. 2) 6</ref>
