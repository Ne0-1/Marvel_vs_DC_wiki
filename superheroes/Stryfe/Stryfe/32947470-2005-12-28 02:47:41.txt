'''Stryfe''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain, and a [[cloning|clone]] of Cable.

==Character history==
When [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] infected the infant Cable with a techno-organic virus, a woman from the distant future appeared to [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]], called herself Askani, and told them that she could save the child, but it meant they would never see him again. Reluctantly, they handed him over.

When they arrived in the future, Askani died, and her kin cloned the baby, hoping to salvage something if he died. Fortunately, he did not die, and both infant and clone were healthy, until the forces of Apocalypse attacked and stole the cloned infant.

Apocalypse took the child as his own, and named him Stryfe, after the name of a particularly powerful foe he once faced, and planned to transfer his essence into Stryfe's body. When he was about to do so, a teenage Cable and the time-travelling Cyclops and Jean (as "Slym" and "Redd" respectively) interrupted and prevented Apocalypse from transferring, and his essence discorporated. His second in command, Ch'vayre, raised Stryfe afterward. (Most of this happened in the "The [[Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]" and "Askani'son" miniseries)

Stryfe managed to travel back in time some two thousand years and sow chaos in the ranks of the [[X-Men]], posing as Cable and attacking Professor X, as well as forming a [[mutant]] [[terrorist]] group, the [[Mutant Liberation Front]]. During this time, he also fought Apocalypse and nearly destroyed him. As a final insurance, he gave [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claimed held genetic material from two thousand years' worth of Summers descendants; in truth, it held the deadly [[Legacy Virus]]. (Most of this happened during the "[[X-Cutioner's Song]]" crossover)

Stryfe and Cable battled until Cable opened a temporal rift, and Stryfe's body was destroyed, but his consciousness entered Cable's mind, and he stayed there until he voluntarily left some time later.  Now physically dead, he later attempted to return to life through the body of [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]].  Although he failed, he later returned through different means.  After a brief return to villainy, Stryfe seemingly died once more, battling an extra-terrestrial virus alongside [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].

==Powers==
Stryfe is an alpha-class [[telepath]] and [[telekinetic]], with raw potential surpassing that of [[Professor X]]. Unlike his genetic template [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], he has nothing to hold back his powers, except a lack of formal training.
