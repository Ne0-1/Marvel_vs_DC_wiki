'''Stryfe''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]] and related characters, especially [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[X-Force]]. Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist/co-writer [[Rob Liefeld]], he first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #87 ([[1990#March|March 1990]]).

After the [[Askani]] tribe of the [[39th century]] transported the child of the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and his wife [[Madelyne Pryor]] to their time to cure his [[techno-organic virus]], they created a [[clone (genetics)|clone]] in case the so-called “[[savior]] child” died. The clone was captured by the tyrant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and became '''Stryfe''', while the original became the freedom fighter '''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'''.

After trying to destroy every [[20th century]] person he despised, in the 1992 [[fictional crossover|crossover]] “[[X-Cutioner's Song|X-Cutioner’s Song]],” Stryfe physically died but, due to his vast psychic powers, has re-emerged a few times since.

Stryfe is a very powerful [[telepath]] and [[telekinetic]], with raw potential surpassing that of Professor X. Unlike his genetic antecedent Cable, he has nothing to hold back his powers, except a lack of formal training.

==Fictional character biography==
When [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] impregnates the infant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] with a [[techno-organic]] virus, a woman from the distant future introducing herself as [[Askani]] appears to [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Askani tells them that she could save the child, but it meant they would never see him again. They hand him over. When Askani and the baby arrive in the future, Askani dies, and her kin clone the baby, hoping to salvage something if he dies. 

Fortunately, he did not die, and both infant and clone were healthy, until the forces of Apocalypse attack and stole the cloned infant. Apocalypse takes the child as his own, intending to use him as his next host body, and names him Stryfe, after an opponent that nearly destroyed him in the [[20th century]]. This would turn out to be a [[predestination paradox]]: the child and the enemy would turn out to be one and the same.

When Apocalypse was about to transfer his essence into Stryfe, he discovered that he was a clone, thus unfit to house his essence. A teenage Cable and the time-traveling Cyclops and Jean (as “Slym” and “Redd” respectively) confronted Apocalypse, leaving him unable to transfer into any host body, this causing his essence to discorporate. Apocalypse's second in command, Ch’vayre, raises Stryfe afterward. (Most of this happened in the ''[[Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'' and ''Askani’son'' miniseries).

Stryfe grew up to be an insane madman, wanting vengeance on both what he thought were his real parents (Cyclops and Jean) and his spiritual parent, Apocalypse. He raises an army and became a fierce opponent of both Cable’s [[Clan Chosen]] and the [[New Canaanites]], a despotic regime that replaced Apocalypse’s. During these wars he manages to kill Cable’s wife Jenskot and kidnap and brainwash their son [[Genesis (comics)|Tyler]].

In [[AD]] [[4th millennium|3806]], the New Canaanites took full control of the planet, but Stryfe manages to travel back in time some two thousand years. He sows chaos in the ranks of the X-Men, posing as Cable and attacking [[Professor X]], as well as forming a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] group, the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] along side many powerful mutants including [[Dragoness (comics)|Tamara Kurtz]]. During this time, he fights a freshly awakened Apocalypse and nearly destroys him. As a final insurance, he gives [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claims held genetic material from two thousand years’ worth of Summers descendants; in truth, it held the deadly '''[[Legacy Virus]]'''. (Most of this happened during the ''X-Cutioner’s Song'' crossover.)

Stryfe and Cable battle until Cable opens a temporal rift, and Stryfe’s body was destroyed. His consciousness entered Cable’s mind, and he stays there until he voluntarily left some time later.

Now physically dead, he later attempts to return to life through the body of [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. Although he failed, he later returns through different means. After a brief return to villainy, Stryfe seemingly dies once more, battling an extra-terrestrial creature alongside [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] ''[[Gambit & Bishop: Sons of the Atom]]'', a six-issue limited series released in 2001.

In the end, Stryfe regrets the path and choices he had made in his life, which is why he sacrifices himself to save the Earth from La Bete Noir. This entity is a creature/force trapped within the Earth at the beginnings of the universe by the [[Phoenix Force]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Stryfe===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', Stryfe is also the leader of the Mutant Liberation Front, though no mention of his link either to Apocalypse or Cable is made as of yet. He appears to be a mutant supremacist convinced that Xavier was killed by the United States government and that mutants should fight against it. However when Psylocke scanned his mind she sensed that he had no real conviction in what he said, suggesting that much of his mutant supremacist attitude is an act, meaning his real motives are unknown. At his side is the ultimate version of [[Zero (comics)|Zero]], a young mutant teleporter. It is revealed that Stryfe is actually a con man, working with Fenris to promote mutant unrest so they can sell Sentinels to the government.
