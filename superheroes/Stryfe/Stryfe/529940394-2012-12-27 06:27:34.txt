'''Stryfe''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The character was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Rob Liefeld]], and first appears in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #87 (March 1990). Stryfe is the main [[antagonist]] in the 1990s [[fictional crossover|crossover]], ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' and the 2009 ''[[X-Force]]/[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' crossover, ''[[Messiah War]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Stryfe is the clone of '''[[Cable (comics)|Nathan Christopher Summers]]''', the son of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] (a clone of [[Jean Grey]]); when the immortal mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] infects the infant Nathan with a [[techno-organic virus]], a woman from the distant future introducing herself as [[Askani]] appears to Cyclops and Jean Grey, telling them that she can save the child. Once the infant Nathan arrives in the future, Askani clones the baby, hoping to salvage something if he dies. The clone's growth is greatly accelerated until he is the same age as Nathan himself. The Askani succeed in halting the spread of the techno-organic virus in Nathan's body, thereby saving his life. However, Apocalypse and his forces attack the Askani's hiding place and steal the cloned infant. Apocalypse takes the child as his own, raising him himself and naming him Stryfe, intending to use him as his next host body. As Apocalypse is about to transfer his essence into Stryfe, he discovers that Stryfe is in fact a clone, thus unfit to house his essence. A teenage Nathan and the time-traveling Cyclops and Jean confront Apocalypse, leaving him unable to transfer into any host body, thus causing his essence to discorporate. Apocalypse's second in command, Ch'vayre, raises Stryfe afterwards.<ref>''The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix'' #4</ref>

Stryfe grows up to be an insane madman, wanting vengeance on both what he thought were his real parents (Cyclops and Jean) and his spiritual parent, Apocalypse. He becomes an anarchist and terrorist rebel in the Nor-Am Pact region c.  3783-3806. in his alternate future. He raises an army and became a fierce opponent of both Nathan (now known as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]) and his Clan Chosen, and the [[New Canaanites]], a despotic regime that replaced Apocalypse's. During these wars he kills Cable's wife, Jenskot, as well as kidnapping and brainwashing their son,<ref>''Cable'' #1, (May 1993)</ref>  [[Genesis (comics)|Tyler Dayspring]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

In 3806, the New Canaanites take full control of the planet, but Stryfe manages to travel back in time two-thousand years.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He forms a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] group, the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF), alongside many powerful mutants including [[Dragoness (comics)|Tamara Kurtz]]. Stryfe orders his Mutant Liberation Front to capture [[Rusty Collins]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #87</ref> In Japan, he fought Cable and first clashed with the [[New Mutants]], who thwarted his attempt to poison the water supplies of major cities.<ref>''New Mutants'' #93-94</ref> Before long, his face was revealed to his minions; he looked identical to Cable.<ref>''New Mutants'' #100</ref> Stryfe abandoned his Antarctic Mutant Liberation Front base during an invasion by the new [[X-Force]] team (a reorganized New Mutants lineup).<ref>''X-Force'' #1</ref> Stryfe then had the Mutant Liberation Front free the captive mutants [[Hairbag]] and [[Slab (comics)|Slab]], and turned them over to [[Mister Sinister]] before ordering an MLF attack on a clinic.<ref>''X-Factor'' #77-78</ref> He also confronted and defeated [[Garrison Kane|Kane]] (Weapon X II),<ref>''X-Force'' #9-10</ref> and eventually declared his enmity for Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #13</ref> Stryfe later battled Cable, who learned that Stryfe was actually his double.<ref>''Cable'' #1-2</ref> Stryfe sows chaos in the ranks of the X-Men, posing as Cable and shooting [[Professor X]], as part of an assassination attempt.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #294</ref> He confronts his captives, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]].<ref name="X-Force #16">''X-Force'' #16</ref> He bested the [[Dark Riders]], and confronted Apocalypse on the moon.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #15</ref> Stryfe fights Apocalypse and nearly destroys him, wounding Apocalypse badly, becoming leader of the Dark Riders.<ref>''X-Force'' #17</ref> As a final insurance, Stryfe gives [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claims holds genetic material from two-thousand years worth of Summers's descendants; in truth, it holds the deadly [[Legacy Virus]].<ref>''X-Cutioner’s Song''</ref><ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref> Stryfe battles Cable until the latter opens a temporal rift by detonating a self-destruct system, destroying his body.<ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref> Stryfe's consciousness, however, enters Cable's mind, in which he stays until he voluntarily leaves.<ref>''Cable'' #6-8</ref>

While physically dead, Stryfe attempts to return to life through the body of [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]].<ref>''X-Force'' #73</ref> However his attempt is avoided by the arrival of X-Force and Warpath was sent back to the living by Blackheart <ref>''X-Force'' #74</ref>
Somehow by unknown means Stryfe was revived and together with the Dark Riders began to subjugate Latveria.<ref>''X-Man'' #45</ref> Stryfe was opposed by Cable and Nate Grey, and at first beat them easily, even going as far as to siphon off all of Nate's power. However, in the end, Stryfe was betrayed by Madelyne Pryor, who gave Nate his power back. Stryfe was defeated by Nate.<ref>''X-Man'' #47</ref>

Stryfe then reappeared controlling the activation sequence for the Prime Sentinels. He used them to hunt down Lady Deathstrike, who held the complete codes for all the Sentinels in her cybernetic systems. Deathstrike was forced to turn to the X-Men, and together they defeated Stryfe, who teleported away.<ref>''X-Men Annual 2000'', writer Chris Claremont, artist Scot Eaton</ref>

Later, Stryfe tried to hunt down [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] who was at the time possessed by an entity known as the Bete Noir, whose power rivaled the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] itself and threatened to consume Bishop's body and unleash its evil upon the universe.<ref>''[[Gambit & Bishop: Sons of the Atom]]'' (2001)</ref> However in the end, Stryfe regrets the path and choices he has made in his life, freed Bishop from the entity and sacrifices himself to save the Earth from La Bete Noir. Bishop remembers a proverb from his time - "It doesn't matter how a man lived his life; what matters is how he ends it" - and says he thinks Stryfe ended his life well.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Stryfe made an appearance in the ''Messiah War'' storyline, which is set in an alternate future.{{Issue|date=April 2011}} This was confirmed by the writer Christopher Yost to be the same Stryfe that had previously plagued the X-Men, mentioning in particular his survival of his fight against Nate Grey and Cable.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22472]</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Stryfe was a clone of the mutant Cable and, as a result, possessed Cable's natural mutant abilities of telepathy and telekinesis. However, these abilities are far more powerful than the ones Cable has generally displayed in the main continuity, sufficient to block the use of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]'s superhuman powers. This is due to the fact that Stryfe was never infected with Apocalypse's techno-organic virus like Cable was. Therefore, he does not have to constantly expend his abilities to keep the virus from consuming his body, which apparently was a huge drain on Cable's capabilities. He also possessed other abilities through genetic manipulation similar to those that Cable achieved through cybernetic augmentation, including superhuman strength and durability.

Stryfe wears battle armor of unknown composition that is highly impervious to damage. He has been known to wield a blade capable of harming [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. He has used various advanced weaponry and technology from the 39th century of his alternate future, including his time-vortex field generator.

Stryfe has received extensive training in military combat techniques and the martial arts, and is a master marksman with firearms.  He is a cunning terrorist strategist.

However when [[Psylocke]] scans his mind she senses that he has no real conviction in what he says, suggesting that much of his mutant supremacist attitude is an act, meaning his real motives are unknown.{{Issue|date=March 2012}} At his side is the ultimate version of [[Zero (comics)|Zero]], a young mutant teleporter. It is revealed that Stryfe is actually a con man, working with [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] to promote mutant unrest so they can sell [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] to the government.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #84</ref>
