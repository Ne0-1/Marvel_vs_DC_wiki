'''Volstagg''' is a [[fictional character]], a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]], a trio of [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] adventurers and supporting cast of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. He is not taken from mythology but an original creation, most likely inspired by [[Falstaff]]. Stan Lee admitted his Asgardians spoke an English halfway between Shakespeare and the King James Bible.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early appearances===
Volstagg's origin beyond being a member of the Asgardian race and a friend of Thor has not been revealed. Volstagg is fairly advanced in age for an Asgardian, and it has been alluded to that he was a highly respected and feared warrior in his prime.

In a sense, Volstagg's entire career has been one long origin story. The character was first introduced in a "Tales of Asgard" filler in ''Journey Into Mystery'', the magazine carrying Thor's Asgardian adventures. As originally envisioned by [[Jack Kirby]], Volstagg was a huge, bumbling oaf much given to boasting and bragging: the last into battle and the first to claim victory (usually undeserved). Referring to himself as "The Lion of Asgard," he usually caused more problems than he solved and seemed totally unaware of the chaos that almost always followed in his wake. A flashback revealed in ''Captain Marvel'' #42 tells how a drunken Volstagg incurred the wrath of Odin by spilling the secrets of the first Frost Giants to a younger Thor. Strangely enough, he was considered a trusted and worthy comrade by his closest friends and allies, [[Fandral|Fandral the Dashing]], [[Hogun|Hogun the Grim]], and Marvel's  biggest pinch-hitter, The Mighty Thor.

===As regular cast-member===
As the [[Warriors Three]] made increasingly frequent appearances in ''The Mighty Thor'' and other Marvel titles, a slightly more heroic side to his personality began to emerge. In ''Tales To Astonish'' # 101, Volstagg squared-off with [[The Incredible Hulk]] for two panels (before being dumped contemptuously in a roadside ditch by the green-skinned behemoth); in ''Thor'' # 164, the Lion of Asgard rushed through a tunnel to battle the demonic Mangog (a creature possessed of the power of a billion' 'billion' beings) but was prevented when the passage proved too narrow to accommodate his considerable girth. Even more spectacular examples of his peerless bravery ensued: during a trip to Hades to rescue his comrade-in-arms Thor, Volstagg offered to battle the Arch-Fiend [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in return for his friend's noble soul (despite being aware that the God of Thunder had already bested the Lord of Hell in fair combat some time previously).

A real change to Volstagg's character came in the early seventies, when Thor and the Warriors Three were battling the interstellar parasite Ego-Prime in the streets of New York City: hiding behind a festering heap of garbage, Volstagg saw a group of extra-terrestrial monstrosities preparing to devour a little girl, a sight which drove him to a remarkable (for him) display of courage and resolution. Despite his obvious terror, the Volumous One struck the creatures down with his ''bare hands'' and carried the child to safety (it would be revealed much later that Volstagg was himself a family man and would never stand to see an innocent child harmed in any way).

===Under Walt Simonson===
Following a brief hiatus towards the end of the seventies, Volstagg underwent a renaissance of sorts when [[Walt Simonson]] took over ''The Mighty Thor'' in 1982. Reaching back to Kirby's initial concept, Simonson redefined Volstagg as a big, likeable bear of a man,  a friend to all with a song in their heart (and a glass in their hand). A good-natured old warrior somewhat past his prime, Volstagg is still held in high regard by his comrades, if only for his amusing company and unparalleled drinking ability. Simonson also added another dimension previously unseen in his earlier incarnations - a household full of plump, pampered children he never failed to indulge at every turn. 

This updated persona became a crucial plot device in several of Simonson's classic story arcs: when [[Balder (comics)|Balder the Brave]] returns broken and hopeless from the land of the dead, it is the kind-hearted Volstagg who takes the fallen warrior under his wing (introducing him to the twin joys of gluttony and drunkenness). As he tells his despairing companion, "Many there are who assume that I eat only to escape a nagging shrew of a wife. Nonsense! I eat only because I enjoy it!".

In a later plotline, when Thor's actions indirectly deprive two mortal lads (Kevin and Mick) of their parents, he takes them to Asgard - and to the Hall of Volstagg - where he knows they will be loved and protected by the largest and kindest of all Odin's warriors. When the boys first mistake Volstagg for Santa Claus, he assures them that while he was not that particular time-honored saint, he is "yet a friend to children everywhere" - as indeed he turned out to be, towards the end of Simonson's run on the title.

Simonson elevates Volstagg to the position of reluctant hero once more. When the Frost Giants descend upon a plague-ridden Asgard, Volstagg is the only warrior left to defend the ramparts - a role he fulfills admirably, once he realises he has discovered an enemy even more stupid and cowardly than himself. Saving the day by default as always, the Lion of Asgard accepts the praise and gratitude of his companions with his usual humility - musing on how the poets of later ages will depict his glorious exploits for all time.

===New Mutants===

Volstagg and his family have also encountered the [[New Mutants]]. During the group's first trip to Asgard, Volstagg makes friends with Roberto DaCosta, aka [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], challenging him to feats of strength, including arm-wrestling and the lifting of Volstagg himself.

In the group's second visit, Volstagg's children encounter [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Hrimhari]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], who were on the run from Hela's forces. Hela herself is currently following through with a plan to kill Odin and conquer Asgard. The children switch places with the group so as to emphasize to their elders, when they return, of the seriousness of the situation. They tell the heroes of [[Tiwaz]], a powerful sorcerer who might help them in the fight. Hrimhari, wolf-prince of a far-away tribe of wolf-people, tells the children that tales of Volstagg's children were told to his people and it was a honor to be in their debt. 

Volstagg would later personally participate in the battle against Hela's forces, working with his Warrior's Three comrades and other Asgardian forces; in the end Odin is saved. 

Soon after this point, when Odin is awake and aware, his mind becomes overtaken by the influence of Loki. Persecuted, the Warriors Three are forced to go on the run, gaining a new ally in the form of a heroic, young palace guardsman.

===Volstagg's role===
Volstagg was used primarily as comedy relief, seeming to know more about the raising of the mug (his favorite weapon, evidently) than the raising of the sword (of which he actually knew very little). Ironically, whenever his courage fails (at the slightest sign of danger), Volstagg's innate clumsiness would somehow seize victory from the jaws of defeat. In a typically Kirbyesque touch, Volstagg inadverantly saves his companions' lives on at least two occasions by stumbling onto the one weapon capable of saving the day (and later claiming that his initial cowardly retreat was all part of a vast master plan).

It should be noted that there have been at least two sub stories about Volstagg's past that presented him as exceptionally well built and a capable warrior.  It has also been hinted at on numerous occasions that he ceased his full time warrior's life to be a husband and father.

===Ragnarok===
Eventually, Loki brings about Ragnarok.  Volstagg, alone of the Warriors Three, survives the initial attacks.  He is later discovered by Thor taking refuge in a statue of [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigg]] and having lost considerable weight.  He unites with Thor and eventually fight in the final battle of Ragnarok. There, along with the rest of Asgard, he dies.

As with all Asgardians, he has returned, this time to Midgard, where a new version of Asgard has arisen in the Midwest of the United States.

==Powers and abilities==
Volstagg possesses a number of superhuman attributes conventionally possessed by all Asgardians.

Volstagg possesses superhuman strength. While he is still stronger than most Asgardian males, he is no longer in his physical prime. Aside from his strength, some of Volstagg's other physical capabilities have decreased, mostly due to his obesity. Volstagg's speed, stamina, and agility are now inferior to that of the majority of his race. 

Volstagg is extremely long lived, although not truly immortal, and ages much slower than a human being. The tissues of his body are also superhumanly resistant to physical injury. However, it is possible to injure him but his lifeforce enables him to recover with superhuman speed and efficiency.

In a number of stories, Volstagg is represented as an excellent overall battlefield warrior and is highly proficient in all Asgardian weapons; an excellent swordsman and archer, a superb pugilist and a master of the quarterstaff. Volstagg is also capable of using his sheer bulk to his advantage in combat situations.

==Other versions==
===[[MC2]]===
An older version of Volstagg has appeared in the alternate future series called ''[[Last Planet Standing]]''. 

===Ultimate Volstagg===
Volstagg the Voluminous briefly appears in ''[[Ultimates]] 2'' #1, meeting with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] at the Terrace in the Sky restaurant in Morningside Heights to warn. He is there to warn Thor of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s plot against him. None of the other patrons can see Volstagg, and it was unclear at the time whether this is due to Loki's interference or whether Volstagg is merely a [[delusion]] of Thor. During the discussion, Volstagg states that Loki is rewriting reality even as they speak; Loki then shows up in one panel as one of the restauraunt patrons. At the end of ''Ultimates 2'', Thor was proven to be a god and it is inferred that Loki was indeed interfering.
