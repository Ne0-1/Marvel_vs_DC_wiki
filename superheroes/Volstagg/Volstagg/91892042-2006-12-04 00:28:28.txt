'''Volstagg''' is a [[fictional character]], a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]], a trio of [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] adventurers and supporting cast of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}.

==Character history==
===Early appearances===
Volstagg's origin beyond being a member of the Asgardian race and a friend of Thor has not been revealed. Volstagg is fairly advanced in age for an Asgardian, and it has been alluded to that he was a highly respected and feared warrior in his prime.

In a sense, Volstagg's entire career has been one long origin story. The character was first introduced in a "Tales of Asgard" filler in ''Journey Into Mystery'', the magazine carrying Thor's Asgardian adventures. As originally envisioned by [[Jack Kirby]], Volstagg was a huge, bumbling oaf much given to boasting and bragging: the last into battle and the first to claim victory (usually undeserved). Referring to himself as "The Lion of Asgard," he usually caused more problems than he solved and seemed totally unaware of the chaos that almost always followed in his wake. Strangely enough, he was considered a trusted and worthy comrade by his closest friends and allies, [[Fandral|Fandral the Dashing]], [[Hogun|Hogun the Grim]], and Marvel's  biggest pinch-hitter, The Mighty Thor.

===As regular cast-member===
As the [[Warriors Three]] made increasingly frequent appearances in ''The Mighty Thor'' and other Marvel titles, a slightly more heroic side to his personality began to emerge. In ''Tales To Astonish'' # 101, Volstagg squared-off with [[The Incredible Hulk]] for two panels (before being dumped contemptuously in a roadside ditch by the green-skinned behemoth); in ''Thor'' # 164, the Lion of Asgard rushed through a tunnel to battle the demonic Mangog (a creature possessed of the power of a billion' 'billion' beings) but was prevented when the passage proved too narrow to accommodate his considerable girth. Even more spectacular examples of his peerless bravery ensued: during a trip to Hades to rescue his comrade-in-arms Thor, Volstagg offered to battle the Arch-Fiend [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in return for his friend's noble soul (despite being aware that the God of Thunder had already bested the Lord of Hell in fair combat some time previously).

A real change to Volstagg's character came in the early seventies, when Thor and the Warriors Three were battling the interstellar parasite Ego-Prime in the streets of New York City: hiding behind a festering heap of garbage, Volstagg saw a group of extra-terrestrial monstrosities preparing to devour a little girl, a sight which drove him to a remarkable (for him) display of courage and resolution. Despite his obvious terror, the Volumous One struck the creatures down with his ''bare hands'' and carried the child to safety (it would be revealed much later that Volstagg was himself a family man and would never stand to see an innocent child harmed in any way).

===Under Walt Simonson===
Following a brief hiatus towards the end of the seventies, Volstagg underwent a renaissance of sorts when [[Walt Simonson]] took over ''The Mighty Thor'' in 1982. Reaching back to Kirby's initial concept, Simonson redefined Volstagg as a big, likeable bear of a man,  a friend to all with a song in their heart (and a glass in their hand). A good-natured old warrior somewhat past his prime, Volstagg was still held in high regard by his comrades, if only for his amusing company and unparalleled drinking ability. Simonson also added another dimension previously unseen in his earlier incarnations - a household full of plump, pampered children he never failed to indulge at every turn. 

This updated persona became a crucial plot device in several of Simonson's classic story arcs: when [[Balder (comics)|Balder the Brave]] returned broken and hopeless from the land of the dead, it was the kind-hearted Volstagg who took the fallen warrior under his wing (introducing him to the twin joys of gluttony and drunkenness). As he tells his despairing companion, "Many there are who assume that I eat only to escape a nagging shrew of a wife. Nonsense! I eat only because I enjoy it!" - thus suggesting his reasons for joining the Warriors Three, despite their considerable differences in age and ability.

In a later plotline, when Thor's actions indirectly deprived two mortal lads (Kevin and Mick) of their parents, he takes them to Asgard - and to the Hall of Volstagg - where he knows they will be loved and protected by the largest and kindest of all Odin's warriors. When the boys first mistake Volstagg for Santa Claus, he assures them that while he was not that particular time-honored saint, he is "yet a friend to children everywhere" - as indeed he turned out to be, towards the end of Simonson's run on the title.

In an obvious tribute to Jack Kirby, Simonson elevated Volstagg to the position of reluctant hero once more. When the Frost Giants descend upon a plague-ridden Asgard, Volstagg is the only warrior left to defend the ramparts - a role he fulfills admirably, once he realises he has discovered an enemy even more stupid and cowardly than himself. Saving the day by default as always, the Lion of Asgard accepts the praise and gratitude of his companions with his usual humility - musing on how the poets of later ages will depict his glorious exploits for all time.

===Volstagg's role===
While some people see Volstagg being based on [[Friar Tuck]] from the legends of [[Robin Hood]], he is in fact more similar to Shakespeare's [[Sir John Falstaff]]. Both are rotund cowards who talk a good fight, and are fond of their food and drink. There is also slight similarity between their names.

Volstagg was used primarily as comedy relief, seeming to know more about the raising of the mug (his favorite weapon, evidently) than the raising of the sword (of which he actually knew very little). Ironically, whenever his courage failed (at the slightest sign of danger), Volstagg's innate clumsiness would somehow seize victory from the jaws of defeat, proving that sheer stupidity could triumph where brute force could not. In a typically Kirbyesque touch, Volstagg inadverantly saved his companions' lives on at least two occasions by stumbling onto the one weapon capable of saving the day (and later claiming that his initial cowardly retreat was all part of a vast master plan).

==Ragnorok==

Eventually, Loki brought about Ragnorok.  Volstagg, alone of the Warriors Three, survived the inital attacks.  He was later discovered by Thor taking refuge in a statue of Frigg and having lost considerable weight.  He united with Thor and eventually fought in the final battle of Rangnorok in which he died.  It is unknown if he will be brought back to life.

==Powers and abilities==
According to some sources, Volstagg's skin, bone and muscle is roughly 3 times as dense as a human's, giving him superhuman resistance to injury. Furthermore, Volstagg is (supposedly) twice as strong as the average Asgardian male, as he can lift (press) roughly 50 tons under optimum conditions. In a number of stories, Volstagg is represented as an excellent overall battlefield warrior and is highly proficient in all Asgardian weapons; an excellent swordsman and archer, a superb pugilist and a master of the quarterstaff - although most of the earlier stories appear to contradict this. One thing all of the strip's many writers all agree upon, however, is that Volstagg is highly proficient in using his enormous bulk as a weapon in combat - and usually with hilarious results.

==Alternate universe Volstagg==
Volstagg the Voluminous briefly appeared on-panel in ''Ultimates 2'' #1, meeting with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] at the Terrace in the Sky restaurant in Morningside Heights to warn him of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s plot against him. None of the other patrons could see Volstagg, and it was unclear whether this was due to Loki's interference or whether Volstagg was merely a [[delusion]] of Thor.

Another, older version of Volstagg recently appeared in the [[MC2]] universe miniseries called [[Last Planet Standing]].

Trivia:

Many people have noticed similarities between Volstagg's comic presentation and the Middlebush Giant popularized by P.T. Barnum.
