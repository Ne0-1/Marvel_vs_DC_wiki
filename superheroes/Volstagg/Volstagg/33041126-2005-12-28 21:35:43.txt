'''Volstagg''' is a charter member of the Warriors Three, a trio of Asgardian adventurers and supporting cast of Marvel's Thor comics.


===Origin===
As of yet, Volstagg's origin beyond being a member of the Asgardian race and a friend of Thor has not been revealed. Volstagg is fairly advanced in age for an Asgardian, and it has been alluded to that he was a highly respected and feared warrior in his prime.

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Agardians, Volstagg's skin, bone and muscle is roughly 3 times as dense as a human's, giving him superhuman resistance to injury. Furthermore, Volstagg is twice as strong as the average Asgardian male, as he can lift (press) roughly 50 tons under optimum conditions.

Volstag is an excellent overall battlefield warrior and is highly proficient in all Asgardian weapons. He is an excellent swordsman and archer, a superb pugilist and a master of the quarterstaff. Volstagg is highly proficient in using his enormous bulk as a weapon in combat.
