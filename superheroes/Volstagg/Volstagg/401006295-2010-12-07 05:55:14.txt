'''Volstagg''' is a [[fictional character]], a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]], a trio of [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] adventurers and supporting cast of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. He is not taken from mythology but an original creation, modeled on [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Falstaff]]<ref name="Falstaff">[http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html interview with Stan Lee in Twomorrows.com]</ref> in character and name. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Early appearances===
Volstagg's origin beyond being a member of the Asgardian race, a warrior and adventurer, and a friend of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] has not been revealed. Volstagg is fairly advanced in age for an Asgardian, and it has been suggested that he was a highly respected and feared warrior in his prime.

In a sense, Volstagg's entire career has been one long origin story. The character was first introduced in a "Tales of Asgard" filler in ''Journey Into Mystery'', the magazine carrying Thor's Asgardian adventures.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} As originally envisioned by [[Jack Kirby]], Volstagg was a huge, bumbling oaf much given to boasting and bragging: the last into battle and the first to claim victory (usually undeserved). Referring to himself as "The Lion of Asgard," he usually caused more problems than he solved and seemed totally unaware of the chaos that almost always followed in his wake. A flashback revealed in ''Captain Marvel'' #42 tells how a drunken Volstagg incurred the wrath of Odin by spilling the secrets of the first Frost Giants to a younger Thor. Strangely enough, he was considered a trusted and worthy comrade by his closest friends and allies, [[Fandral|Fandral the Dashing]], [[Hogun|Hogun the Grim]], and Thor.

In his first appearance, Volstagg joined with the Warriors Three in Thor's quest for the power that had cracked the Odinsword of Asgard.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #119</ref> Volstagg then helped repel the attack of the Flying Trolls of Thryheim, although he cowered for a lot of the fight,<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #124-125</ref> helped defeat the forces of Harokin,<ref>''Thor'' #129-131</ref> was lured into a trap by the dragon [[Fafnir (Marvel Comics)|Fafnir]] who used an illusion, and defeated [[Mogul of the Mystic Mountain]].<ref>''Thor'' #137-145</ref>

===As regular cast member===
As the [[Warriors Three]] made increasingly frequent appearances in ''The Mighty Thor'' and other Marvel titles, a slightly more heroic side to his personality began to emerge. In ''Tales To Astonish'' # 101, Volstagg squared-off with [[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]] for two panels (before being dumped contemptuously in a roadside ditch by the green-skinned behemoth);<ref>''Tales To Astonish'' # 101</ref> Volstagg helped defend [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] against the demonic [[Mangog]] (a creature possessed of the power of a billion' 'billion' beings)<ref>''Thor'' #155-157</ref> and in ''Thor'' # 164, the Lion of Asgard rushed through a tunnel to battle Mangog but was prevented when the passage proved too narrow to accommodate his considerable girth.<ref>''Thor'' # 164</ref> Volstagg battled the Thermal Man,<ref>''Thor'' #169-170</ref> was among the forces of Asgard defeated by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]],<ref>''Thor'' #175-176</ref> and helped defend Asgard against [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #177</ref> Even more spectacular examples of his peerless bravery ensued: during a trip to Hades to rescue his comrade-in-arms Thor, Volstagg offered to battle the Arch-Fiend [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in return for his friend's noble soul (despite being aware that the God of Thunder had already bested the Lord of Hell in fair combat some time previously). Ultimately, he helped Thor escape Mephisto.<ref>''Thor'' #180-181</ref> Entranced by [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]], Volstagg was forced to battle Thor, and battled [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]], [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], and the other Asgardians. He was freed from his trance by Loki and [[Karnilla]], and joined his life force to awaken Odin in time to defeat Infinity.<ref>''Thor'' #185-188</ref> Volstagg was sent on a quest by Odin, and returned to help defend Asgard against Mangog again.<ref>''Thor'' #195-198</ref>

A real change to Volstagg's character came in the early seventies, when Thor and the Warriors Three were battling the interstellar parasite Ego-Prime in the streets of New York City: hiding behind a festering heap of garbage, Volstagg saw a group of extraterrestrial monstrosities preparing to devour a little girl, a sight which drove him to a remarkable (for him) display of courage and resolution. Despite his obvious terror, the Volumous One struck the creatures down with his ''bare hands'' and carried the child to safety (it would be revealed much later that Volstagg was himself a family man and would never stand to see an innocent child harmed in any way). However, Volstagg and the other Asgardians battling Ego-Prime were exiled to Earth; Volstagg was abducted by Mephisto, but freed by Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #202-205</ref> He helped Thor battle [[Mercurio (comics)|Mercurio]].<ref>''Thor'' #208</ref> With Thor and company, Volstagg set out on a quest to find the missing Odin. He battled Sssthgar's slavers, Mercurio, and [[Xorr the God-Jewel|Xorr]], and defeated the doppelgangers created by the wizard Igron.<ref>''Thor'' #212-217</ref>

Volstagg later battled [[Zarrko]] the Tomorrow Man.<ref>''Thor'' #242-245</ref> He defeated diamond exchange robbers in New York.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 1 #30</ref> Volstagg helped depose the usurpers Mangog and Igron.<ref>''Thor'' #248-250</ref> He set out again on a quest to find the missing Odin, and battled Spoor, [[Grey Gargoyle]], and the Soul-Survivors.<ref>''Thor'' #255-263</ref> Volstagg defeated the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] and the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and battled the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Thor'' #264-266</ref> Volstagg then helped defend Asgard against Ragnarok,<ref>''Thor'' #274-278</ref> and later battled Fafnir again.<ref>''Thor'' #287-288</ref>

===Under Walt Simonson===
Following a brief hiatus towards the end of the seventies, Volstagg underwent a renaissance of sorts when [[Walt Simonson]] took over ''The Mighty Thor'' in 1982. Reaching back to Kirby's initial concept, Simonson redefined Volstagg as a big, likeable bear of a man, a friend to all with a song in their heart (and a glass in their hand). A good-natured old warrior somewhat past his prime, Volstagg is still held in high regard by his comrades, if only for his amusing company and unparalleled drinking ability. Simonson also added another dimension previously unseen in his earlier incarnations — a household full of plump, pampered children he never failed to indulge at every turn. His children included sons Alaric and Rolfe, and daughters Flosi, Gudrun, and Gunnhild ("Hildy").

This updated persona became a crucial plot device in several of Simonson's classic story arcs: when [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder the Brave]] returns broken and hopeless from the land of the dead, it is the kind-hearted Volstagg who takes the fallen warrior under his wing (introducing him to the twin joys of gluttony and drunkenness). As he tells his despairing companion, "Many there are who assume that I eat only to escape a nagging shrew of a wife. Nonsense! I eat only because I enjoy it!"{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Volstagg rescued Mord.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #13</ref> He then battled the forces of Surtur on Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #249; ''Thor'' #350-352</ref> In a later plotline, when Thor's actions indirectly deprive two mortal lads (Kevin and Mick) of their parents, he takes them to Asgard — and to the Hall of Volstagg — where he knows they will be loved and protected by the largest and kindest of all Odin's warriors. When the boys first mistake Volstagg for Santa Claus, he assures them that while he was not that particular time-honored saint, he is "yet a friend to children everywhere" <ref>''Thor'' (vol. 1) #373-374</ref> — as indeed he turned out to be, towards the end of Simonson's run on the title.

Simonson elevates Volstagg to the position of reluctant hero once more. When the Frost Giants descend upon a plague-ridden Asgard, Volstagg is the only warrior left to defend the ramparts — a role he fulfills admirably, once he realizes he has discovered an enemy even more stupid and cowardly than himself. Saving the day by default as always, the Lion of Asgard accepts the praise and gratitude of his companions with his usual humility — musing on how the poets of later ages will depict his glorious exploits for all time.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

===New Mutants===
Volstagg and his family have also encountered the [[New Mutants]]. During the group's first trip to Asgard, Volstagg makes friends with Roberto DaCosta, aka [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], challenging him to feats of strength, including arm-wrestling and the lifting of Volstagg himself.<ref>"New Mutants Special Edition" #1</ref>

In the group's second visit, Volstagg's children encounter [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Hrimhari]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], who were on the run from Hela's forces. Hela herself is currently following through with a plan to kill Odin and conquer Asgard. The children switch places with the group so as to emphasize to their elders, when they return, of the seriousness of the situation. They tell the heroes of [[Tiwaz]], a powerful sorcerer who might help them in the fight. Hrimhari, wolf-prince of a far-away tribe of wolf-people, tells the children that tales of Volstagg's children were told to his people and it was an honor to be in their debt. Volstagg, the other Warriors and various Asgardians join with the New Mutants; their efforts stop Hela from killing Odin.<ref>"New Mutants" Vol1 #83-87</ref>

Volstagg is later overcome by a mystery plague.<ref>''Thor'' #377-378</ref> He then helped defend Asgard against the forces of [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]].<ref>''Thor'' #393</ref> He went alone on a quest to rescue Mord.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #36</ref> He went on a quest with Thor to seek Ulagg.<ref>''Thor'' #404-406</ref> He helped the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battle [[Blastaar]].<ref>''Avengers'' #310</ref> Volsagg then battled [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] and Surtur.<ref>''Thor'' #421-426</ref> He also attempted to prevent the second [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thor (Eric Masterson)]] from entering Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' #434</ref>

Volstagg would later personally participate in the battle against Hela's forces, working with his Warrior's Three comrades and other Asgardian forces; in the end Odin is saved.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Soon after this point, when Odin is awake and aware, his mind becomes overtaken by the influence of Loki. Persecuted, the Warriors Three are forced to go on the run, gaining a new ally in the form of a young palace guardsman.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

===Volstagg's role===
Volstagg was used primarily as comedy relief in the same way [[Falstaff]], who Volstagg was modeled on, was comedy relief in [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Henry IV]]. Stan Lee admitted his comics were inspired by Shakespeare, his Asgardians speaking in an English halfway between Shakespeare and the King James Bible. Volstagg's name is derived from Falstaff and the [[Volsunga Saga]] of Norse mythology.

Volstagg, like Falstaff, is fat, vain, boastful, and cowardly, but also boon companion to the prince (Hal or Thor). He seems to know more about raising a mug (his favorite weapon, evidently) than raising a sword (of which he actually knew very little). Ironically, whenever his courage fails (at the slightest sign of danger), Volstagg's innate clumsiness would somehow seize victory from the jaws of defeat. In a typically Kirbyesque touch, Volstagg inadvertently saves his companions' lives on at least two occasions by stumbling onto the one weapon capable of saving the day (and later claiming that his initial cowardly retreat was all part of a vast master plan).

It should be noted that there have been at least two sub stories about Volstagg's past that presented him as exceptionally well built and a capable warrior.  On the other hand, in the ''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' series (confirmed to be canonical from Official Handbook files of Asgardians{{Issue|date=April 2010}}), Volstagg is depicted as obese and cowardly even as a young man.<ref>''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' #7 (August 11, 2004)</ref> Oddly enough, while apparently somewhat older than Thor, he does not seem to be considerably older.

It has also been hinted at on numerous occasions that he ceased his full time warrior's life to be a husband and father.

===Ragnarok and re-birth===
Eventually, Loki brings about Ragnarok. Volstagg, alone of the Warriors Three, survives the initial attacks. He is later discovered by Thor taking refuge in a statue of [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigg]] and having lost considerable weight. He unites with Thor and eventually fights in the final battle of Ragnarok. There, along with the rest of Asgard, he dies.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #82-85 (December 2004)</ref>

As with all Asgardians, he has returned, this time to Midgard, where a new version of Asgard has arisen in [[Oklahoma]]. All the Warriors Three were in the forms of three soldiers in Africa, and are the second group to be reborn.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3 #4</ref> During Secret Invasion, Volstagg distracts the Super-Skrull sent to destroy Asgard after it defeats Beta Ray Bill long enough for Blake to turn into Thor.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #1-3</ref>

===''Siege''===
Volstagg is later responsible for setting events in motion that would allow the Siege of Asgard to occur, after he heads to Chicago seeking to have adventures like those of Thor. He stops a robbery but causes a lot of damage. He is attacked by the [[U-Foes]] (who were operating under orders of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and Loki). The incident destroys [[Soldier Field]] in Chicago, killing many, due to Volstagg deflecting the energy blasts using his sword.<ref>''Siege #1''</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24329 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege" #1 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref>

[[Ben Urich]] and Will Stern later encounter Volstagg who is returning to Asgard to turn himself in after what happened at Soldier Field. Ben Urich and Will Stern realize that Norman Osborn is attempting to shift public opinion by stacking the media in his favor. They then convince Volstagg to allow them to accompany him on his way back to Asgard to get his interview and to cover the invasion from another perspective.<ref>"Siege: Embedded" #1</ref>

Ben Urich, Will Stern and Volstagg reach a roadblock as they approach Broxton, Oklahoma and are spotted in their news van by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. Volstagg exits the van and enganges the agents directly while Ben and Will speed off but are caught only moments later.<ref>''Siege Embedded'' #2</ref>

In the Broxton jail, Volstagg is speaking to the sheriff and his deputy as the news reports on the attack on Asgard, showing footage of Thor being beaten down. Realizing that what's going on is wrong, the sheriff releases Volstagg so that he can go help defend his home. Volstagg stops though, when he realizes all the lies that are being spread about him and the other Asgardians. The sheriff sets him up in front of a webcam, and Volstagg sends out a video to the world about what really happened in Chicago. Word quickly spreads, and people everywhere are beginning to question Norman Osborn and H.A.M.M.E.R.'s attack on Asgard. As Volstagg is leaving the police station, Thor lands in front of him and smacks him to the ground. Volstagg realizes that this is not the true Thor; this is the clone, [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]].<ref>''Thor'' #607</ref> He battles the clone in a deserted field to avoid more damage but is beaten.<ref>''Thor'' #608</ref> Finally when Osborn tries to escape after the events, Volstagg stops him.<ref>''Siege'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Volstagg possesses a number of superhuman attributes conventionally possessed by all Asgardians.

Volstagg possesses superhuman strength. While he is still stronger than most Asgardian males, he is no longer in his physical prime. Aside from his strength, some of Volstagg's other physical capabilities have decreased, mostly due to his obesity. Volstagg's speed, stamina, and agility are now inferior to that of the majority of his race.

Volstagg is extremely long lived, although not truly immortal, and ages much slower than a human being. The tissues of his body are also superhumanly resistant to physical injury. However, it is possible to injure him but his life-force enables him to recover with superhuman speed and efficiency.

In a number of stories, Volstagg is represented as an excellent overall battlefield warrior and is highly proficient in all Asgardian weapons; an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, swordsman, horseman, and archer, a superb pugilist and a master of the quarterstaff. Volstagg's battle prowess is somewhat limited by his advanced age and tremendous girth. However, Volstagg is still capable of using his sheer bulk to his advantage in combat situations. It has been suggested on several occasions that Volstagg can increase his mass/weight,{{Issue|date=May 2009}} making himself weigh so much that only the strongest of Asgardians can lift him. He can consume vast quantities of food and drink.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
An older version of Volstagg has appeared in the alternate future series called ''[[Last Planet Standing]]''.

===Ultimate Volstagg===
Volstagg the Voluminous briefly appears in ''[[Ultimates]] 2'' #1, meeting with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] at the Terrace in the Sky restaurant in Morningside Heights. He is there to warn Thor of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s plot against him. None of the other patrons can see Volstagg, and it was unclear at the time whether this is due to Loki's interference or whether Volstagg is merely a [[delusion]] of Thor. During the discussion, Volstagg states that Loki is rewriting reality even as they speak; Loki then shows up in one panel as one of the restaurant patrons. At the end of ''Ultimates 2'', Thor was proven to be a god and it is inferred that Loki was indeed interfering.
