'''The Enchanters''' are [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comic books]] published by 
[[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Enchanters Three first appear in [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] #143-144 (August-September 1967), and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

The group subsequently appears in ''Thor'' #14-20 (August 1999-February 2000).

==Fictional character biography==
The Enchanters are apparently brothers and hail from the realm of Ringsfjord, which exists on the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional]] continent of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]]. The original three Enchanters are Forsung; Brona and Magnir, sorcerers whose power is amplified by the Living Talismans in their possession. They are first encountered by the Asgardian warriors [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]] and [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], who follow the pair and decide to conquer Asgard and then Earth. Balder and Sif escape to Earth to warn the Thunder god Thor of the impending threat, unaware that Brona and Magnir are following. Forsung decides to travel to Asgard and confront Odin directly. Thor and his fellow Asgardians defeat the Enchanters, while after a long and protracted battle Odin slays Forsung and crushes his Living Talisman. Odin then banishes Brona and Magnir to a limbo-like dimension. <ref>''Thor'' #143 - 145 (Aug. - Oct. 1967)</ref>

Years later, Thor discovers he is having difficulty controlling his magical hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]], which veers away when thrown and sometimes won't return, despite its' enchantments. During a battle with the [[Absorbing Man]], Mjolnir becomes lodged in a wall and does not return. Thor reverts back to his current mortal persona of Jake Olsen, who is subsequently given a heart attack by a being that emerges from Mjolnir - Enrakt, the newest Enchanter. Enrakt is the youngest of the brothers and was apparently still in training during the first battle with the Asgardians. Although the [[Warriors Three]] come to Thor's aid, they are defeated by Enrakt, who brags that his now free brothers - Brona and Magnir - are attacking Odin at that very moment. Jake Olsen takes advantage of the melee to reclaim Mjolnir, and as Thor fights Enrakt to standstill, who then escapes to Asgard.

Aided by fellow Avenger the [[Scarlet Witch]], Thor travels to Asgard, where together with Odin the trio are swallowed by a gigantic serpent summoned by Enrakt. After freeing themselves, they confront the Enchanters Three. Odin defeats Brona and crushes his Living Amulet; the Scarlet Witch traps Magnir in solid rock and Thor almost beats Enrakt to death. At the suggestion of Odin, Thor unmasks Enrakt to discover it is actually the corpse of '''Ceranda''', a woman Thor met off-world and once loved. Enrakt had been using her body - and Mjolnir - to hold his spirit. Enrakt's spirit, together with Brona and Magnir, is then banished once again and Ceranda's body is placed in state in a memorial hall in Asgard. <ref>''Thor'' #15 - 20 (vol. 2, Sept. 1999 - Feb. 2000)</ref>

==The Living Talismans==
Each of the Enchanters wears a sentient talisman carved in the image of a stone face on their chests.  Each of these Living Talismans can speak and act of their own volition; absorb energy and enhance the Enchanters' powers. With a Living Amulet, Enrakt was capable of overcoming Odin's enchantments on Mjolnir and used the weapon against Thor. Each Living Talisman can also manifest itself in other forms, such as an elemental storm or as a humanoid creature. All four Living Talismans were presumably destroyed: Forsung and Brona's were destroyed by Odin; Enrakt's was crushed by Thor and Magnir's was apparently disposed of before being banished again.
