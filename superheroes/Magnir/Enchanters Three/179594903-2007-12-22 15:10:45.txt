'''The Enchanters''' are [[fictional character]]s that appear in the 
[[Marvel Universe]]. They first appear in [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] vol. 1, #143 and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
The Enchanters are apparently brothers and hail from the realm of Ringsfjord, which exists on the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional]] continent of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]]. The original three Enchanters were called Forsung; Brona and Magnir. All three are master sorcerers possessed of tremendous power, whose abilities are amplified by their Living Talismans (see below), with the eldest, Forsung, possessing enough power to match [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]. First encountered by the Asgardian warriors [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]] and [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], the three decide to conquer Asgard and then Earth. Balder and Sif escape to Earth to warn the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] of the impending threat, unaware that Brona and Magnir are following. Forsung decides to travel to Asgard and confront Odin directly. Thor and his fellow Asgardians defeat the Enchanters, while after a long and protracted battle Odin slays Forsung and crushes his Living Talisman. Odin then banishes Brona and Magnir to a limbo-like dimension. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #143 - 145</ref>

Years later, Thor discovers that he is having difficulty controlling [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]], which would sometimes veer away when thrown or not return at all. The mystery resolves itself during a battle with the [[Absorbing Man]], when Mjolnir becomes lodged in a wall and refuses to return. Thor reverts back to his Jake Olsen persona, who is subsequently given a heart attack by a being that emerges from Mjolnir - Enrakt, the newest Enchanter. Enrakt is the youngest of the brothers and was apparently still in training during the first bout with the Asgardians. Although the [[Warriors Three]] come to Thor's aid, they are defeated by Enrakt, who brags that his now free brothers - Brona and Magnir - are attacking Odin at that very moment. Jake Olsen takes advantage of the melee to reclaim Mjolnir, and as Thor fights Enrakt to standstill, who then escapes to Asgard.

Aided by fellow Avenger the [[Scarlet Witch]], Thor travels to Asgard, and despite a minor setback (Odin, Thor and the Scarlet Witch are swallowed by a gigantic serpent summoned by Enrakt) confront the Enchanters Three. Odin defeats Brona and crushes his Living Amulet; the Scarlet Witch traps Magnir in solid rock and Thor almost beats Enrakt to death. At the suggestion of Odin, Thor unmasks Enrakt to discover it is actually the corpse of Ceranda, a woman Thor met off-world and once loved. Enrakt had been using her body - and Mjolnir - to hold his spirit. Enrakt's spirit and Brona and Magnir are then banished once more and Ceranda's body is placed in state in a memorial hall in Asgard. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #15 - 20</ref>

==The Living Talismans==

Each of the Enchanters wears a sentient talisman carved in the image of a stone face on their chests.  Each of these Living Talismans can speak and act of their own volition; absorb energy and most importantly enhance the Enchanters' powers, sometimes to an unbelievable degree as Enrakt was capable of overcoming Odin's enchantments on Mjolnir and used the weapon against Thor. Each Living Talisman can also manifest itself in other forms, such as an elemental storm or as an imposing and incredibly strong humanoid creature. All four Living Talismans were presumably destroyed - Odin crushed those belonging to Forsung and Brona; Thor destroyed Enrakt's, and Magnir's was apparently disposed of before being banished again.
