'''Onyxx''' ('''Sidney Green''') is a [[fictional]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #171, and was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Salvador Larroca]].

==Fictional character biography==
Onyxx was passed from various foster homes and orphanages, unable to find acceptance because of his crude behavior<ref name="files">198 Files</ref> and chronic [[bedwetting]].  However, the latter was cured when young Sidney mutated into the huge rock-like form he now possesses, much to his delight.  

Onyxx became a student at the Xavier Institute, assigned to [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit's]] training squad. Onyxx had a romantic interest in a new student at the Institute by the name of Foxx. It was later revealed that Foxx was actually a long time adversary of the [[X-Men]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. She infiltrated the school to destabilize the relationship between Gambit and her foster daughter [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. After having revealed herself to the X-Men, Onyxx attacked Mystique for not returning his affection. Mystique escaped and, with the help of an accomplice, injured Onyxx.

Sidney retained his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and continued residing at the school. Onyxx was critically injured by [[William Stryker|Reverend Stryker]] during his attack on the institute; Onyxx barely survived. Onyxx was later captured alongside his fellow students in [[Otherplace|Limbo]].  

He currently resides at the Xavier Institute in its new location, [[San Francisco]].

==Powers and abilities==
Onyxx has a craggy [[granite]] body which gives him superhuman strength and greater resistance to physical injury. He has also been seen to have a second pair of eyes, but it is unknown if these serve any special purpose.
