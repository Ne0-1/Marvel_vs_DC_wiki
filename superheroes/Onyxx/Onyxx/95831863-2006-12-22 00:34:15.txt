'''Onyxx''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]].  His first appearance was in ''[[X-Men]]'' (2nd series) #171.

==Character biography==

Born '''Sidney Green''', Onyxx was passed from various foster homes and orphanages, unable to find acceptance because of his crude behavior and chronic bed-wetting.  However, the latter was cured when young Sidney mutated into the huge rock-like form he now possesses, much to his delight.  Onyxx currently is a student at the Xavier Institute, assigned to [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit's]] training squad. Onyxx had a romantic interest in a new student at the Institute by the name of Foxx.  It was later revealed that Foxx was actually a long time adversary of the [[X-Men]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].  She infiltrated the school to destabilize the relationship between Gambit and her foster daughter [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].  After having revealed herself to the X-Men, Onyxx attacked Mystique for not returning his affection.  Mystique escaped and, with the help of an accomplice, injured Onyxx.

Sidney retained his powers post [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and is still residing at the school. Onyxx was critically injured by [[William Stryker|Reverend Stryker]] during his attack on the institute; Onyxx barely survived.

== Powers ==
Onyxx has a craggy [[granite]] body which gives him superhuman strength and greater resistance to physical injury.  He has also been seen to have a second pair of eyes, but it is unknown if these serve any special purpose.
