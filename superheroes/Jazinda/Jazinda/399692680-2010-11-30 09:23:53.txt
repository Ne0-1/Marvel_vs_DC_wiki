'''Jazinda''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supporting character. She is the estranged daughter of Kl'rt the [[Super-Skrull]]. Exiled from the Skrull empire under threat of death as a traitor, she currently resides and works on Earth as part of a freelance bounty hunting team with [[She-Hulk]].

==Fictional character biography==
Jazinda was born on Tarnax IV and is the daughter of the Super-Skrull, though grew to adulthood on Zaragz'Na, both worlds within the Skrull empire. As of the beginning of her bounty hunting partnership with Jennifer Walters, the former had been eaten by [[Galactus]], while the latter was destroyed by the [[Annihilation Wave]]. The Annihilation Wave's destruction of the planet also claimed the life of her brother, Kl'rt's favored offspring, who was still living there at the time.

Some years prior to teaming up with Jen, Jazinda was sent on a mission by her Skrull superiors to retrieve the Sy-Torak gem—claiming it as a sacred Skrull artifact—from the Kree. When the mission was compromised, she swallowed the gem with the intention to make it harder for them to retrieve. Instead, it ended up bonding with her body, granting her immortality and the ability to return from the dead. Coming to the realization that any attempt by the Skrull high priests to remove the gem would result in her permanent death, Jazinda instead chose to go on the run and exile herself. As a result, her father—unable to accept Jazinda's resourcefulness and determination to survive where her brother had died—vowed to kill her as a matter of honor. He made a successful attempt to notify her of her impending execution via signal transmission, a message she received prior to the events of ''[[Secret Invasion]]''.

While on Earth, Jazinda saved She-Hulk's life so they could form a business arrangement, confessing to her own fugitive state in the process. During the three months between then and their capture of Rockwell Davis, the two women move into a motor home in Dona Little's Trailer Park which they also use as a mobile base of operations while tracking offenders for Freeman Bonding, Inc. (the only bail bond agency willing to deal with super powered offenders). While living there, she modifies her usual Skrull features into those of a Caucasian female with short brown hair and green eyes(in other words, Jennifer Walters). After bonding somewhat with Roz, the daughter of the park's owner, over their mutual father issues, Jaz uses her shapechanging abilities to make Roz' father realize he needs to express his love for his daughter.

After mistakenly aiding an interstellar mass murderer attempting to escape a bounty hunter, she is killed by him when she discovers the truth and he murders a camper who had the misfortune to encounter him. After She-Hulk rescues the murdered woman's husband, Jazinda resurrects and cold-bloodedly kills the murder in revenge for his actions. She would later attempt to kill the host of the Celtic demigod [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]] in order to stop his benefactors giant-sized rampage but was unwittingly preempted from doing so by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].

===Secret Invasion===
During [[Secret Invasion]], after coming to blows over her foreknowledge of skrull invasion plans, she and Jen manage to capture Nogor—a religious figure known as the Talisman to his people who is on earth masquerading as [[Longshot]] -- with the intention of using him to break the spirit of the invaders. While attempting to transport him to New York, Kl'rt arrives under the cover of the invasion to carry out his daughter's death sentence. Although She-Hulk valiantly tries to stop him, he succeeds in shooting Jazinda in the head in preparation for Noldor to remove the gem. At the last moment however he changes his mind, having been convinced by She-Hulk's arguments that what he was doing was wrong. Forcefully removing Nogor from the scene, he departs asking her to explain Jazinda's reprieve as anything other than his love for her.

Following the resolution of the invasion, Jazinda adopts the guise of a Shi'Ar warrior and joins She-Hulk, [[Thundra]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie II]] and [[Invisible Woman|Sue Richards]] to form the [[Lady Liberators]] in an attempt to redistribute stagnating international relief aid in the corrupt country of Marinmer.

While believing herself about to be killed and dissected by government scientists Jazinda contacts She-Hulk through a device she secretly implanted in She-Hulk's head and tells She-Hulk to leave her to her fate and pretend they never knew one another. Her last words before being knocked out are "I've always l..."

===S.W.O.R.D.===
Jazinda appeared briefly in Marvel's ''[[S.W.O.R.D.]]'' series as one of the aliens being evacuated from Earth and sent back to their home planets.

==Personality==
After fleeing the Skrulls, Jazinda focused on the pragmatic concerns of her own survival, working in disguise as a bounty hunter. However, after strategically teaming up with She-Hulk as part of a business arrangement, something changed. The two women became friends, and living amongst humans combined with Jen's past heroic endeavors started Jazinda considering notions of altruism as a guiding principle. That, however, does not prevent her from killing, quite possibly in cold blood and certainly out of a sense of revenge: as she points out, she isn't a hero.

Though strained on occasion, the strength of the bond that had developed between Jazinda and Jen—whom she considers her only friend in the galaxy—is demonstrated through her repeatedly expressing concern for Jen's mental well being and sense of identity following events surrounding the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], and when she confesses her immortality and the fact that she's betrayed her people in acquiring the ability. 

She has repeatedly demonstrated a sarcastic streak, and sometimes uses her shapeshifting abilities to drive a point home.

===Familiar shape===
While working with She-Hulk, Jaz has been known to repeatedly assume the human form of Jennifer Walters. Though she seems to do so in order to confuse their quarry, she also has been seen adopting her friend's human form in times of stress. Whether any deeper significance to this action exists has yet to be revealed, though she has expressed amusement that she considers herself better at being human than her friend is.

===Sexuality===
As a Skrull, Jazinda finds the disparity in Terran cultures towards the sexual activities of men and women to be strange. Her statement, along with the behavior of fellow exile [[Xavin]], carries the implication of a similar attitude towards sexual orientation; she at one point jokes that she and Jen met through an interstellar [[lesbian]] [[dating service]]. By her own admission Jazinda's had 37 sexual partners, 5 of whom she's slept with simultaneously. It is also implied that she has a crush on She-Hulk and may have sought her out as a partner for that reason.

==Powers and abilities==
In addition to her natural shape-shifting abilities as a Skrull, Jazinda's bonding with the Sy-Torak gem has gifted her with immortality and a phenomenal regenerative ability that allows her to resurrect herself when she is killed or otherwise dies. One such incident in which she was killed by having her neck broken saw her return to life and capture a bounty before reconnecting her severed cervical vertebrae. Another saw her body eject a [[bullet]] from her forehead some minutes 'after' she'd resurrected.
