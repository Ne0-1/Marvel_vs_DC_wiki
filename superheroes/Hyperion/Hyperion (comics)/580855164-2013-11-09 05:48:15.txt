'''Hyperion''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] that appear in publications published by Marvel Comics. The first character debuted in ''The Avengers'' #69 (Oct. 1969), with five notable versions to date - two supervillains belonging to the team [[Squadron Sinister]] (from Earth-616) two heroes from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]], and a zombified clone.

==Publication history== <!-- Needs to be split into "Publication history" and "Fictional character biography" sections -->

===Squadron Sinister (Earth-616)===
The first Hyperion in Marvel Comics debuted in the title the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''.<ref>''Avengers'' #69 (Oct. 1969)</ref> This story arc introduced the [[supervillain]] team the Squadron Sinister, whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]], with Hyperion based on [[Superman]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72â€“73</ref>

The Squadron Sinister are assembled by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]] - the superhero team the Avengers. The Avengers defeat the Squadron and thwart the Grandmaster, with the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] miniaturizing Hyperion and trapping him in a glass sphere.<ref>''Avengers'' #69 - 71 (Oct. - Dec. 1969)</ref> The Squadron reappear in the title [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]]. The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] to melt the [[polar ice caps]], thereby covering the entirety of the Earth's surface in water. The superhero team the Defenders prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon), with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] overpowering Hyperion.<ref>''Defenders'' #13 - 14 (May - July 1974)</ref>

After this defeat Hyperion and his two remaining team mates are teleported off world by Nebulon, and later return to Earth. Acquiring an energy-draining weapon, the villains plan to threaten the Earth once again but are defeated by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref>

Hyperion has another brief encounter with several members of the Avengers, who seek a way to separate the Power Prism of [[Doctor Spectrum]] from fellow Avenger the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref> The character battles Thor once again and encounters the Earth-712 version of Hyperion from the [[Squadron Supreme]].<ref name=Thor280>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref> Hyperion is also involved with the warrior woman [[Thundra]], with the relationship ending when she discovers a means of returning to her own dimension.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #67 (Sep. 1980)</ref> In the Earth-712 universe Hyperion is told by the villain [[Master Menace]] that he is an inorganic duplicate created by the Grandmaster modeled on the Hyperion from that universe. A bitter Hyperion then impersonates the Squadron Supreme's version of Hyperion for several weeks before dying in battle against the original.<ref name="Squadron Supreme' 1986">''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (Apr. 1986)</ref> The Grandmaster briefly resurrects the character as part of the [[Legion of the Unliving]], a group created to combat the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #16 (Dec. 1987)</ref>

A new Hyperion is made when the Grandmaster later reappears and reforms the Squadron Sinister. Hyperion is joined by a new Doctor Spectrum ('''Alice Nugent''', former lab assistant of Henry Pym); the [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] (now called [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]]) and Nighthawk. This Hyperion originated from the Microverse, like the original Sinister Hyperion claimed before learning his origins were a lie. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the '''Wellspring of Power''' - an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities - the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they battle the New Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts team leader [[Baron Zemo]] defeats the Grandmaster, and in the ensuing chaos Hyperion and the members of the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15 - 16 (Jan. - Feb. 2006) & ''Thunderbolts'' #102 - 108 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref>

===Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme}}
Thomas and penciller John Buscema also created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] team of heroes called the Squadron Supreme in the title ''Avengers'',<ref>''Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971)</ref> using characters that shared names with those of the Squadron Sinister (this caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) claimed the issues featured appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues). The last known [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] left on Earth-712,<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref> the character is a founding member of the Squadron Supreme and has a civilian identity, Mark Milton.

The Earth-712 Hyperion appears on every occasion with the Squadron Supreme, and the group first encounter beings from the [[Earth-616]] universe when four Avengers - the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]]; [[Scarlet Witch]]; [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the second [[Hawkeye (comics)|Goliath]] - accidentally arrive. The Avengers first battle and then assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant [[Brain-Child]], before returning to their own universe.<ref>''Avengers'' #85 - 86 (Feb. - Mar. 1971)</ref>

Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme fall under control of the artifact the [[Serpent Crown]] and battle the Avengers in the Earth-616 universe before being freed;<ref>''Avengers'' #141 -144 (Nov. 1975 - Feb. 1976)</ref> encounter Thor when he battles the evil Hyperion <ref name=Thor280/> and enlists the aid of the Defenders against the villain the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] and his ally [[Null, the Living Darkness]] when they threaten the Earth-712 universe.<ref>''Defenders'' #112 - 115 (Oct. 1982 - Jan. 1983)</ref>

In the 12-issue ''Squadron Supreme'' miniseries (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) [[Mark Gruenwald]] picked up from where Earth-712 was last seen in ''Defenders'' #114 and revealed Hyperion's origin. In the miniseries, Hyperion and other Squadron members resolve - against the advice of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk]] - to assume control of the government of the [[United States]] on Earth-712. Hyperion helps establish the behavior modification program;<ref>''Squadron Supreme''  #2 (Oct. 1985)</ref> defeats and [[Brainwashing|brainwashes]] the [[Institute of Evil]];<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5 - 6 (Jan. - Feb. 1986)</ref> and is trapped in an inter-dimensional zone by the evil (Zhib-Ran) Hyperion. Forced to ally himself with Master Menace to escape, Hyperion battles Zhib-Ran to death and while victorious is blinded.<ref name="Squadron Supreme' 1986"/> After a battle to the death with Nighthawk and the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]], a team formed to stop the domineering Squadron, Hyperion relents and relinquishes power.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #12 (Aug. 1986)</ref>

The character and the surviving members of the Squadron Supreme travel into space to protect their planet from the expanding [[Nth Man]], and are exiled to the Earth-616 universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (June 1989)</ref> The team encounters the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], and take up residence at the government facility [[Project Pegasus]].<ref>''Quasar'' #13 (Aug. 1990)</ref> Quasar and the Eternal [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] rescue the Squadron when the team becomes captured by the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]. It is at this time that Makkari identifies Hyperion as an Eternal and teaches him how to restore his eyesight.<ref>''Quasar'' #14 - 16 (Sep. - Nov. 1990)</ref> Aided by team mates the [[Whizzer (comics)#Stanley Stewart|Whizzer]] and [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], the character battles the entity [[Deathurge]],<ref>''Quasar'' #25</ref> with the entire Squadron then assisting the Avengers against the villain Imus Champion before finding the means to return to their universe.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #5 - 6 (June - July 1998) & Annual 1998</ref> The team then disband but are reunited by Hyperion once learning a corrupt government has filled the power vacuum left by the Squadron.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (Sep. 1998)</ref> With the aid of inter-dimensional adventurers the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], Hyperion and the Squadron expose the government to a global audience.<ref>''Exiles'' #77 - 78 (Apr. - May 2006)</ref>

===Supreme Power (Earth-31916)===
{{see also|Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)}}
The mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Squadron Supreme. This Mark Milton was sent to Earth in a spacecraft, and seized shortly after by U.S. government agents who raised him in a tightly controlled, isolated environment and exposed him to frequent propaganda.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #1</ref> As an adult, he became a covert agent used in strict secrecy, but eventually a reporter came too close to the truth, and the decision was made to go public,<ref>''Supreme Power'' #3</ref> largely so he could be used as a distraction from the government's even more closely guarded secret super-operative, [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Joe Ledger]]<ref>''Supreme Power'' #4</ref> He briefly teams with [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-31916)|Nighthawk]] and [[Blur (comics)|Blur]] to find and defeat the super-powered [[serial killer]] [[Redstone (comics)#Supreme Power|Michael Redstone]].<ref>''Supreme Power'' #12-14</ref> As Hyperion discovers that he has been systematically lied to,<ref>''Supreme Power #2-9</ref> he becomes disillusioned with his government and finally openly rebels.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #9</ref> When the government attempts to blackmail him into returning by revealing his alien status to the public, he responds by smashing into the [[South Pole]] from space, creating a [[Richter scale|10.5]] seismic event.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #18</ref><ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #1</ref>

In the ''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' miniseries, a hastily-assembled team of superhumans is sent by the government to retrieve him, and the resulting battleâ€”through an interaction of Hyperion's "flash vision" eye-beams, [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)#Supreme Power|Nuke]]'s radiation blast, and [[Arcanna#Squadron Supreme (Earth-31916)|Arcanna]]'s reality manipulationâ€”sends the combatants into a (seeming) [[alternate timeline]]<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #2</ref> where Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme (consisting of several retrieval team members plus several previously unseen superhumans) rule a [[dystopian]] world, causing Hyperion on the advice of his otherworld counterpart<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #4</ref> to rethink his ideas about power, humanity, and teamwork, leading him to surrender to the Squadron from his world.<ref>''Supreme Power: Hyperion'' #5</ref> It is only afterwards that [[Master Menace#Supreme Power|Emil Burbank]] deduces that it was not an alternate world they travelled to, but their own future; Burbank tells no one of his discovery.

===King Hyperion (Earth-4023)===
Another Hyperion, King Hyperion from the ''Exiles'' series (see below), was later seen in Russia battling the [[Winter Guard]] and the [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]].<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3 (Sept. 2010)</ref> He was nominated for the Thunderbolts program by [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Thunderbolts ''#151 (Feb. 2011)</ref> King Hyperion tells the team he is the heroic version, and that the Hyperion who fought Blue Marvel had switched their places upon defeat. This turns out to be a lie, and he turns on the Thunderbolts during their first mission together.{{Issue|date=March 2011}} After briefly battling Juggernaut, he is brought down by Ghost, who uses the nanites in King Hyperion's spine to dose him with Argonite. Moonstone, Juggernaut and Man Thing savagely beat the weakened King Hyperion.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #153 (Apr. 2011)</ref>

===Zombie Hyperion (Earth-616)===
Another Hyperion appeared on Earth-616 as a member of the Zombie Squadron Supreme. Like his teammates, this Hyperion is a zombified clone of the hero of Earth-712 and is created by scientists who are attempting to give Earth its own Squadron Supreme.  They graft the DNA of the Earth-712 team (allegedly obtained the last time the team crossed into Earth-616) to corpses of normal humans and zap them with space radiation known as the Z-wave.  This animates the super-powered team to life, but with the unforeseen consequence that they are flesh-craving zombies.  Believing themselves to be the original Squadron Supreme and with no memory of how they got into the underground lab facility, the team goes on a rampage before being quarantined, apparently carrying the same virus present in the majority of [[Marvel Zombies (series)|Marvel Zombies]] books.  Hyperion is the only one to escape while his teammates stay behind to try to escape their own way.  He goes on an eating frenzy in the surrounding Kansas countryside before dying of Mad Cow disease which he contracted while eating a group of cattle.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Supreme'' #1-2</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
Another Hyperion joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s ''The Avengers'' vol. 5, #1 (December 2012). Hickman described the decision to use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:
<blockquote>"This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald's Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose. He comes out of what the big story is behind the whole Avengers three-year plan that I have. He's very important, very pivotal, and I think people are really going to dig where we go with that. He's not going to be our poor analogue for Superman."<ref name="HickmanAvengers">{{Cite web| last=Ching |first=Albert |title=Jonathan Hickman Brings the World to Marvel NOW! AVENGERS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/jonathan-hickman-marvel-now-avengers.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=December 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ClMMUMZ6 |archivedate=December 8, 2012 deadurl=no}}</ref></blockquote>

His origin is that he came to Earth as a baby sent as the only survivor of a race of Eternals from a dying world. He was raised by a man named "Father" who named him Marcus Milton and taught him the morals of society. As an adult, he became the superhero named Hyperion and protected the world alongside the Squadron Supreme. When his reality collided with another reality, Hyperion was the only survivor where he floated around in the void that used to be his reality until a group of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Scientists pulled him into the Earth-616 reality. Hyperion was in the captivity of A.I.M. until he was freed by the Avengers and offered a place amongst them.<ref name="Avengers #4">''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> Hyperion is among the superheroes that joined the Avengers due to the threat of [[Ex Nihilo (comics)|Ex Nihilo]] on Mars.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> Hyperion was with the Avengers when A.I.M. was sighted in the [[Savage Land]] trying to extract the formula from one of the Garden's evolution pods.<ref name="Avengers #4"/>

==Powers and abilities==
All versions of Hyperion possess [[superhuman strength]], [[endurance|stamina]], [[speed]], flight, and [[wikt:durability|durability]]. Each also has greatly enhanced sensory perceptions, which extends to being able to perceive the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and "atomic vision" - the equivalent of [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Energy blasts|heat vision]]. The heroic Earth-712 version of Hyperion also possesses the ability to use [[cosmic energy]] to augment his life force granting him great longevity and regenerative abilities, courtesy of his Eternal heritage.  The Earth-712 Hyperion's powers and vitality are diminished when he is exposed to [[argonite]] [[radiation]]. The Earth-712 Hyperion also has a [[college degree]] in [[journalism]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

==Other versions==
In various alternate universe stories published by Marvel, Hyperion often appears in group shots. The following are versions that each had a notable story presence.

===Paradise X===
In the [[Earth-9997]] universe, a version of Hyperion is recruited by the robot [[Machine Man|X-51]] for his squadron of interdimensional heralds. He stems from a world in which almost all superheroes perished in a nuclear attack by the governments of Earth, leaving him as the only survivor. This Hyperion kills the master villain [[Kulan Gath]] who is responsible for the deaths of many of Earth's heroes on yet another alternate world.<ref>'Heralds' #1-3 and ''Paradise X'' #0 - 12 (Apr. - 2002 - Aug. 2003)</ref>

===''Exiles''===
The alternate universe title ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' features a version of Hyperion referred to as "King Hyperion", who is a member of a team known as [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]. Although initially aiding the team to travel between dimensions to repair the time/space continuum, the character is revealed to be [[psychopathic]] and commits mass [[genocide]] on several worlds before finally being stopped and banished to his original dimension.<ref>''Exiles'' #38 - 40 (Feb. - Apr. 2004) & 63 - 65 (June - Aug. 2005)</ref> However, King Hyperion somehow escaped this dimension and found his way to Earth 616 where he battled and was defeated by the [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]].<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3</ref>

==In other media==
