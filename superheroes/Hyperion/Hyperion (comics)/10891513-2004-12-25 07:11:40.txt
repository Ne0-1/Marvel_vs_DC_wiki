'''Hyperion''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[Squadron Supreme]].  There are actually three different Marvel incarnations of Hyperion, one of whom was a [[supervillain]].  All incarnations are essentially based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]].

==Squadron Sinister==

Hyperion first appeared in ''[[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #70 (November [[1969]]) as a member of the Squadron Sinister, a group of supervillains assembled by the alien [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to fight the Avengers.  This Hyperion was an alien from a [[subatomic]] [[parallel world|parallel universe]] pulled from his world by the Grandmaster for his own purposes, though later comics suggested that the Grandmaster simply created this Hyperion from whole cloth.

This Hyperion was created by [[Roy Thomas]] as part of an homage to the [[Justice League]].

He later fell in love with the heroine [[Thundra]].  For his final fate, see the next section.

==Squadron Supreme==

In ''Avengers'' #85-86 (March-April [[1971]]), Thomas created the Squadron Supreme, a parallel world group of heroes, even more broadly based on the Justice League.  This group had its own version of Hyperion, also an alien, with a human secret identity of Mark Milton.

Hyperion was nominally the group's leader, and was a driving force behing the Utopia Project which the Squadron implemented in the wake of their world being devastated by the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]].

During this period, Hyperion was trapped in limbo by an enemy, and the villainous Hyperion replaced him, forming a romance with [[Power Princess]].  When the heroic Hyperion escaped, he fought the villain to the death of the latter.  The hero was blinded and had to wear special glasses to simulate sight until his sight was eventually restored.

At last note, Hyperion and a reformed Squadron were fighting to free their world from a global dictatorship which had taken it over while the team was stranded in the main Marvel Universe.

==Supreme Power==

In August [[2003]], ''[[Supreme Power]]'' began to chronicle a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]]ed version of the Squadron Supreme.  In this version, Hyperion is an [[alien]] sent to earth as a baby and raised in secret by agents of the [[United States]] government.  As a young man, he revealed himself to humanity as a hero, but remained a government operative.
