'''Hyperion''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[Squadron Supreme]].  There are actually several different Marvel incarnations of Hyperion, at least two of which were [[supervillain]]s. Hyperion was created by [[Roy Thomas]] as part of an homage to the [[Justice League]], with [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[J. Michael Straczynski]] each crafting iconic versions of the character. All incarnations are essentially based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]].

==Various incarnations of Hyperion==
There are four versions of Hyperion from four different dimensions in the Marvel Universe, none of which come from the normal [[Earth 616|("616")]] Marvel universe, though they have interacted with it. The first version, a superhero, was a member of the [[Squadron Supreme]] (Hyperion I). The version of Hyperion in the "[[Supreme Power]]" comic (Hyperion III) is a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]]ed and modernized version of this character, though his status as strict hero or villain is ambiguous. There are two strictly evil versions of Hyperion: one was a member of the Squadron Sinister (Hyperion II), and the other came from an unknown dimension in which he had conquered the Earth and murdered everyone on it, before joining the dimension-displaced [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]] (Hyperion IV).

{{spoiler}}
===Hyperion I (Squadron Supreme)===

In ''Avengers'' #85&ndash;86 (March&ndash;April [[1971]]), Roy Thomas created the Squadron Supreme, a parallel world group of heroes that were the opposites of the Squadron Sinister, and even more broadly based on the Justice League.  One of their members was Hyperion, with a human secret identity of Mark Milton, a cartoonist.  He was thought to be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] for years, but in the comic series ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'', he was revealed to be the sole surviving member of his dimension's race of [[Eternals]].

The character was highlighted in the ''[[Squadron Supreme]]'' limited series by Mark Gruenwald which began in [[1985]].  In this series, the Squadron decides that they have the knowledge, wisdom, and power to make the world a better place, and decide to implement a project to turn their world into a utopia.  Hyperion was nominally the group's leader and was a driving force behind the Utopia Project.  The battle to change the world was hard-fought and ended only after significant loss. ''See below'' for this Hyperion's history with his [[clone]].

In the aftermath of the wars fought to take over their worlds, Hyperion and the Squadron were stranded on Earth-616.  Freed by the Avengers, a reformed Squadron were last seen fighting to free their world from a global dictatorship which had taken it over in the team's absence.

===Hyperion II (Squadron Sinister)===

Hyperion first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #70 (November [[1969]]) as a member of the Squadron Sinister, a group of supervillains assembled by the alien [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to fight the Avengers.  This Hyperion was an alien from a [[subatomic]] [[parallel world|parallel universe]], pulled from his world by the Grandmaster for his own purposes, though later comics suggested that the Grandmaster simply created this Hyperion.

After his initial clash with the Avengers, he had repeated clashes with the [[Defenders]].  Eventually he later fell in love with the heroine [[Thundra (comics)|Thundra]], although this was a brief love affair. Finally, he met the original Hyperion through the machinations of Emil Burbank (a.k.a.[[Master Menace]]) on Earth-Squadron.  On this occasion Burbank battled Hyperion while holding captive the visiting [[Thor (comics)|Thor]].  Suffering defeat once more, Hyperion was taken captive on Earth-S but later found himself in an interdimensional vacuum as he attempted to escape confinement.

During the Squadron's dominance on the world scene, Master Menace pulled Hyperion back through the interdimensional gulf and revealed his true origins. He was actually an inorganic duplicate created by the Grandmaster based on Hyperion I's physique.  As such, he was revealed to be Marvel's version of [[Bizarro]], although retaining sufficient, though uninspired, intellect.
Master Menace caused the two Hyperions to swap places for several weeks, with the good version in the interdimensional void.  The evil Hyperion proceeded to quickly fall in love with Zarda, (a.k.a. [[Power Princess]]), who reminded him of Thundra. The evil Hyperion secretly murdered Zarda's husband, the death appearing to result from natural causes. Forming a romance with the distraught heroine, this caused her confusion as the heroic version returned to Earth-S to battle his counterpart. During an epic struggle, with both emitting full intensity of their atomic vision, the evil version began to degrade rapidly, revealing his true nature.  After Hyperion II's death, however, his counterpart Hyperion I resumed the romance with Zarda.

Although this "evil" version of Hyperion preceded the "good" version in his appearance, he is considered Hyperion (II), while the former is considered Hyperion (I).

===Hyperion III (''Supreme Power'')===

:''Main article: [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)]]''

In August [[2003]], Marvel's mature-readers imprint [[MAX Comics]] started ''[[Supreme Power]]'' by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], ostensibly chronicling a rebooted version of the Squadron Supreme (though the group has yet to form).  In this version, Hyperion is an alien sent to Earth as a baby and raised by agents of the [[United States]] government in a secret government compound by a pseudo-family, under the auspices of a normal childhood. His powers began developing early on and he and the scientists observing him discovered that he had vast superhuman strength, resistance to injury, and speed. Government agents began to manipulate him into becoming a weapon for the U.S. government, and he is publicly revealed to be a hero, dubbed as Hyperion.  Eventually Mark questions his role, and seeks out proof of his origin hidden by the government.  This leads to his attempted murder by the government and his current alienation from humanity.

===Hyperion IV (Exiles)===
[[Image:EXILES 63image big.jpg|120px|Cover to ''Exiles'' #63, by James Calafiore.|thumb|right]]
In [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]], Hyperion was a member of Weapon X (a team like the Exiles not to be confused with the Weapon X program). This was a group of superheroes and supervillains who traversed between dimensions to repair the time/space continuum. However this psychopathic version of Hyperion, instead of performing his mission as dictated by the Tallus, tried to take over Earth. 

Hyperion later decides not to take over that reality's Earth and waits, instead, to move on to new realities and take over several worlds. In the next reality Hyperion is in the middle of taking over Earth when the Exiles appear. The Tallus says the mission is to kill off six members of the interdimensional travelers (the Exiles and Weapon X). In the end, Hyperion is killed by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] in a sacrificial attempt to complete the mission and save that reality. Hyperion's lifeless body is placed in a [[stasis]] gallery, where his body slowly regenerates itself, reviving him. Hyperion gains control of the dimensional teleporting technology responsible for sending the Exiles on their missions, and he tries sending the Exiles on several missions that will kill them. The Exiles managed to track him down, but he killed the team members [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] and [[Namora]]. Another member, [[Beak (comics)|Beak]], managed to retrieve two versions of the heroic Hyperion to incapacitate their evil counterpart. After being defeated, the evil Hyperion was left marooned on the dead Earth of his own dimension.  

This character can be distinguished from the other versions of Hyperion in that he is completely bald. During the story it is mentioned that he was not from Earth, suggesting that he is not an Eternal, as other versions, but an alien.  He also adopted a different costume than the earlier variants.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of Hyperion have roughly the same abilities, which mirror that of the DC character Superman in nearly every respect.  He has very similar powers to Marvel Universe characters [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]] and the [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]], as they too are based on Superman.

He has vast superhuman strength that rivals that of such notable powerhouses such as Thor and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], meaning he can lift ''far'' in excess of 100 tons. He has superhuman speed and reflexes. He can shoot intense plasma beams ("atomic vision") from his eyes and can see outside the normal visible spectrum. He is vulnerable to argonite radiation, but is otherwise essentially invincible to all injury, save his own death rays. He can fly at faster than escape velocity speeds. His senses are superhumanly acute. 

In previous versions, in the event that he is actually killed, his corpse enters a state of suspended animation and if his bodily mass is left alone long enough, it will eventually reconstitute itself and he will return to life. He has a superhuman regenerative healing ability similar to that of the Earth-616 Eternals, who are capable of controlling their own molecular structure. 

Aside from his superhuman advantages, it is worth noting that Hyperion I was highly intelligent and a talented professional artist.
