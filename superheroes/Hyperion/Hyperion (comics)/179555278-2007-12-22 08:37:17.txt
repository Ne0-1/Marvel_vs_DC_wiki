'''Hyperion''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] characters in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Comics Multiverse|"multiverse"]], the first of which debuted in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969). There have been four versions of the character to date - two supervillains belonging to the team [[Squadron Sinister]] (from Earth-616) and two heroes from [[alternate universes]]. (See sidebar)

==Publication history==
===Original Hyperion===
The first Hyperion in Marvel Comics debuted in the final panel of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), part one of a three-issue story by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]]. This story arc introduced the [[supervillain]] team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]]. Hyperion was based on [[Superman]]. <ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72–73</ref> He returned with the Squadron Sinister, minus a reforming [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] in ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #12-13 (Feb. & May 1974).

===Subsequent versions===
Thomas and penciler [[John Buscema]] had meanwhile created an [[alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]] in ''The Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971), using characters that shared names with those of the Squadron Sinister. This caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) cover-blurbed appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact the Squadron Supreme appeared in both issues. This Squadron Supreme starred in an eponymous, 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and successive pencilers Bob Hall, Buscema, and Paul Ryan. ''Squadron Supreme'' focused on the exploits of the team in its home reality. Gruenwald, Ryan, and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]] returned to the characters in the [[graphic-novel]] sequel ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989). The team later featured in a two-part story across ''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'' and the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (both Sept. 1998).

Five years, under the mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint, the 18-issue series ''[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]'' (Oct. 2003 - Oct. 2005), set in a different alternate universe, incorporated yet another version of Hyperion.

==Fictional character biography==
''To avoid confusion, the biography is separated into two sections that describe both the villainous and heroic versions of Hyperion.''

===Hyperion - the supervillains===
====Zhib-Ran====
The first Hyperion appears as a member of the Squadron Sinister, a group of supervillains assembled by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]] - the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Several years later the Squadron Sinister is reunited when Hyperion encounters the alien [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]], and in exchange for freedom - Hyperion was miniaturized and imprisoned in a glass sphere by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] - promises him the Earth. The team then create a giant laser cannon in the Arctic and plan to melt the polar ice caps, thereby covering the entirety of the Earth's surface in water. The Squadron Sinister, however, are stopped by the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. <ref>''The Defenders'' #12-13</ref> After this defeat the Squadron Sinister are teleported off world by Nebulon, but are later returned to Earth. Having acquired an energy-draining weapon, the Squadron Sinister plan to threaten the Earth once more but are defeated by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Yellowjacket (comics)|Yellowjacket]]. <ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref>

Hyperion later has another brief encounter with several members of the Avengers, who at the time are seeking out a way to separate the Power Prism of [[Doctor Spectrum|Dr. Spectrum]] from fellow Avenger the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. <ref>''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref> At this time it was revealed that Hyperion was also involved with the warrior woman [[Thundra]]. <ref>The relationship ends when she discovers a means of returning to her own dimension in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #67</ref> Soon after this Hyperion battles Thor once again and encounters the Earth-712 version of Hyperion from the Squadron Supreme <ref>''Thor'' #280</ref> Hyperion is then imprisoned in the Earth-712 universe, but after being freed by the villain [[Master Menace]] discovers he is actually an inorganic duplicate created by the Grandmaster modeled on the Hyperion from that universe. A bitter Hyperion then impersonates the Squadron Supreme's version of Hyperion for several weeks before finally dying in battle against the original.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (of 12) (1986)</ref>

====Zhib-Ran Reborn?====
Years later a new Hyperion mysteriously appears and at the request of the Grandmaster begins to reform the Squadron Sinister to "save the world". Hyperion and the new Dr. Spectrum (Alice Nugent, former lab assistant of [[Henry Pym]]) find and try and coerce [[Speed Demon]] (the new alias of the Whizzer) and [[Nighthawk (comics)|Nighthawk]] into joining, but both are initially reluctant. Hyperion explains he was the elected leader of a world that existed in the sub-atomic dimensional space known as the [[Microverse]]. When his planet's axis is disrupted by the effects of multiple incursions into the Microverse by [[Genis-Vell|Photon]], a member of the superhero team the [[New Thunderbolts]]. As a result the planet explodes, leaving Hyperion the only survivor. <ref>This story is a variation on the origin that the Grandmaster imprinted on the first Hyperion when first forming the Squadron Sinister. The first Hyperion relates his "false" origin in ''The Defenders'' #14</ref> Hyperion is now determined that no other world suffer his home planet's fate, even if extreme measures are "necessary".

Ironically, the superhero team the [[New Thunderbolts]] become responsible for the pair rejoining the Squadron Sinister. Speed Demon is ejected from the New Thunderbolts for committing robberies, while Nighthawk, who had begun working with the team, quits in protest when [[Baron Zemo]] joins and also learns that he was simply being used to finance their activities. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the Wellspring of Power - an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities - the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they then battle the New Thunderbolts, as Baron Zemo also wishes to have control of the Wellspring. Zemo manages to defeat the Grandmaster, but in the ensuing chaos the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape. Hyperion has yet to reappear.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15-16 and ''Thunderbolts'' #102 - 108</ref>

===Hyperion - the superheroes===
====Mark Milton (Earth-712)====<!-- This section is linked from [[America Redeemers]] -->
This version of Hyperion is the last known [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] left on his Earth, and poses in a civilian identity as cartoonist Mark Milton. He was raised by adopted parents who instilled in him values that led towards his heroic career and proactive approach towards human affairs. <ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1</ref>  Hyperion makes one serious error early in his heroic career by inadvertently creating his own arch-foe - an encounter with criminal scientist Emil Burbank (later known as Master Menace) accidentally causes Burbank's facial hair to grow continually, creating a long standing enmity. 

Hyperion later encounters several other metahumans and together they form the Squadron Supreme, with Hyperion becoming the perennial leader. Hyperion and the other members of his team are first encountered by four Avengers, who accidentally cross into the Earth-712 universe. The Avengers first battle and then assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant [[Brain-Child]], before returning to their own universe. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #85 - 86</ref> Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme later battle the Avengers once again, who help to free the Squadron's Earth from the influence of the artifact the [[Serpent Crown]]. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #141 - 144 + 147 - 149</ref> These and future battles with the Avengers revealed the susceptibility of all Squadron members, including Hyperion, towards mental control. <ref>''Avengers'' Annual 1998</ref>

It is soon after the Serpent Crown affair that Hyperion has his first significant encounter with the villainous Earth-616 version of himself, who crosses into the Earth-712 universe with the aid of a visiting Thor. <ref>''Thor'' v1. #280</ref> After ridding the world of the manipulations of the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] - who usurps the Presidency of the [[United States of America]] and creates world domination - Hyperion goes on to play a major role in the Squadron Supreme decision to take over their Earth and fashion it into a [[utopia]]. After several crisises leading to a deadly battle with several dissenting team members, Hyperion learns the error of his ways. <ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1 - 12 (1985 - 1986)</ref>

He and the surviving members of the Squadron Supreme later travel into space to protect their planet from the [[Nth Man (comics)|Nth Man]], at the cost of being exiled to the Earth-616 universe. <ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989)</ref> Hyperion and the Squadron Supreme reside at the government facility [[Project Pegasus]] for a time, before assisting the Avengers against the villain Imus Champion and then finding the means to return to their universe. <ref>''Quasar'' #13 - 16 + 19 and ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #5 - 6 + Annual 1998</ref> The team disband on returning home, and are then reunited by Hyperion upon learning of a new government assuming the vacuum of power left behind after the Squadron's exile. <ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (1998)</ref> 

Hyperion and the team then briefly aid the team the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]], after the two teams are able to expose the corrupt government to a global audience. <ref>''Exiles'' #77 - 78</ref>

====Mark Milton (Earth-31916)====
{{main|Hyperion (Supreme Power)}}

==Alternate versions==
===Paradise X===
In [[Paradise X]], a version of Hyperion is recruited by the robot [[Machine Man|X-51]] for his squadron of interdimensional heralds. This Hyperion kills the master villain [[Kulan Gath]], who was responsible for the deaths of many superheroes. <ref>''Paradise X:Heralds'' #1 - 3 (2001 - 2002) + ''Paradise X'' #1 - 12 (2002 - 2003)</ref>

===''Exiles''===
This version of Hyperion is a member of a team known as [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]], who travel between dimensions to repair the time/space continuum. Unfortunately, this Hyperion is revealed to be psychopathic and commits mass genocide on several worlds, before finally being stopped and banished to his original dimension - now a lifeless void as he had killed every living thing. <ref>See ''Exiles'' #38 - 40, 63 - 65</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
All versions of Hyperion possess superhuman strength, stamina, speed and durability. Each also has greatly enhanced sensory perceptions, which extends to being able to perceive the entire electro-magnetic spectrum and "atomic vision" - the equivalent of heat vision. The heroic Earth-712 version of Hyperion also possesses a greatly enhanced healing factor courtesy of his Eternal heritage but has yet to exhibit the other racial characteristics of Eternals such as near immortality, molecular manipulation, teleportation, and telepathy.
