'''Stinger''' (real name '''Wendy''') is a fictional [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] [[super villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe.

==Character Biography==
A young [[valley girl]] with electrical-based mutant powers, Stinger is a member of the [[Alliance of Evil]], [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s original strike force.  Because of her youth, Stinger often handles situations recklessly, as seen when she accidentally kills [[Michael Nowlan]]'s girlfriend, Susan.  During their battles with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], Stinger often flirts with [[Angel (comics)|Angel]], much to his annoyance.  Stinger stays with the Alliance of Evil when they defy the [[Mutant Registration Act]], and later battles the [[New Mutants]] with the team.  Her current whereabouts are unknown.

==Powers==
Stinger can build static energy around her hands and discharge it as [[bioelectricity]] bolts.

==Alternate Universes==
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline, there is a young woman named Wendy that resides on [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]] who has a look and powers very similar to Stinger's.  Though it is unconfirmed, it is safe to assume that this is an alternate version of Stinger, which would make Wendy her real name.

==Notes==
* This Stinger (III) should not be confused with Stinger I (Ms. Marvel enemy), Stinger II (Avengers foe), or Stinger IV (Heroes for Hire villain).
