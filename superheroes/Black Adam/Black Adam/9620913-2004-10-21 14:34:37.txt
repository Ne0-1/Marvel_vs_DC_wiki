'''Black Adam''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], often a rival of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].

== Powers ==

When he speaks the word of power "Shazam," Theo Adam is gifted with the stamina of [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]], the swiftness of Heru ([[Horus]]), the strength of [[Ammon]], the wisdom of Zehuti ([[Thoth]]), the power of [[Aten]], and the courage of [[Mehen]].

== History ==

In ancient [[Egypt]], the time of the [[pharaoh]] [[Rameses the Great]], the wizard Shazam chose Teth-Adam to become the land's protector. He told him that "Shazam" would be his word of power, granting him great powers, derived from the attributes of Egypt's gods. While Teth-Adam served as a hero for many years, until the time of the pharaoh [[Hawkman|Khufu Kha-Tar]], he was eventually corrupted by power. Acounts vary, but he was either seduced by the demoness [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]] or became overly brutal in an attempt to protect his homeland of Khandaq, a kingdom near Egypt. In any event, he seized control of Egypt, and became known as Khem-Adam (Black Adam). Shazam revoked his power and Teth-Adam died.

Centuries later, Theo Adam, a descendant or [[reincarnation]] of Khem-Adam, was on an archeological dig with Billy Batson's parents. He murdered the Batsons for a mystic scarab found in Khem-Adam's tomb. He discovered its secrets, and by saying "Shazam," Theo received the power of his ancestor, and used it to battle Shazam's latest champion, Captain Marvel (who wore a red version of Black Adam's outfit with a white cape). Theo Adam later gained Teth-Adam's memories.

Through various plot twists, Black Adam joined the [[Justice Society of America]] (under Captain Marvel's watchful eye), turned on the JSA, joined the [[Injustice Society]], turned on ''them'', and eventually took control of the [[Middle East]]ern nation of Khandaq.

The original [[Fawcett Comics]] version of the character had a broadly similar history, except that, instead of Adam's powers being transeferred through the scarab, the mummified body of Mighty Adam was ressurected.
