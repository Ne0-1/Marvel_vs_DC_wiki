'''Black Adam''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character whose morally ambiguous nature has his character fall between the lines of [[heroism]] and [[villain]]y; as a result, he has associated himself with both [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s in the past. 

The character was originally created in [[1945]] for the premiere issue of [[Fawcett Comics]]' ''[[The Marvel Family]]'' comic book by [[Otto Binder]] and [[C.C. Beck]] as an "evil" version of Fawcett's popular  [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] character. Adam was later revived by [[DC Comics]] in the [[1970s]] ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' comic book, becoming Captain Marvel's most powerful foe in terms of physical abilities. Originally called '''Teth-Adam (Mighty Adam)''' in [[ancient Egypt]], Black Adam was a previous appointee of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], but soon used his power for his own corrupt ends, which forced the wizard to punish him. Generally, that punishment was to remove Adam from that time, only to appear in modern times to challenge Shazam's current appointee, Billy Batson, in his Captain Marvel form. 

By the early 21st century, Adam had been redefined by DC writers [[Jerry Ordway]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[David S. Goyer]] as a corrupted [[anti-hero]] attempting to clear his name, but unable to fully rid himself of his evil influences. Adam's personal goal is to enforce justice; however, his ideals of justice, often involving hostile action or execution, are considered extreme by many of the heroes who have attempted to give the former supervillain a second chance. This current version of Black Adam is the ruler of [[Kahndaq]], a fictional [[Middle Eastern]] nation in the [[DC Universe]]. Featured roles in comic books series such as ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'', ''[[Villains United]]'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' have elevated the character to a level of prominence in DC Comics nearly surpassing that of Captain Marvel.

Adam is depicted as a powerful [[Arabic|Arab]] man wearing a costume similar to Captain Marvel's, except that the red portions are instead black, and Adam does not usually wear a [[cape]] (recent depictions of the character give him a black cape similar to the other Marvels'). Some artists, following C.C. Beck's original design, also depict Adam with pointed, [[elf]]in ears.

==Fawcett Comics==

The original [[Fawcett Comics]] version of Black Adam, which appeared only once during the original Fawcett run of Captain Marvel comics, was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian prince named "Teth-Adam", who was chosen by the wizard Shazam to be his successor.

When Adam said the magic word "Shazam", he was transformed into a black-clad super-powered being, Mighty Adam (literally translating into 'Mighty Human'). Possessing the same powers that Captain Marvel would later be granted, Adam was soon corrupted by the vastness of his powers. No mention was made of the fact that the wizard Shazam seemed to be giving an ancient Egyptian character powers from Greco-Roman deities, a fact which would seem unpalatable to  later writers who would change (twice) the deities whose names made up the acronym "Shazam" for Black Adam.

Deciding that he should rule the world, Adam overthrew the [[pharaoh]] and assumed the throne. An angry Shazam gives his errant champion a new name -- "Black Adam" -- and banishes him to the most distant star in the universe.

Adam spends the next 5000 years flying back to Earth; by the time he makes it back, in [[1945]], Shazam has appointed three new champions to take his place: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Mary Marvel]], and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]]. Adam does battle with the trio, known as the [[Marvel Family]], but since all are equally invulnerable, the fight goes on and on without resolution. At the suggestion of the wizard Shazam, [[Uncle Marvel]] tricks Black Adam into saying the wizard's name, transforming him back into his mortal form. Adam's natural aging process takes hold, and he withers away into a skeleton within moments.

==DC Comics==
===Pre-Crisis and ''Shazam!: The New Beginning''===
While he was defeated in the same story in which he debuted, Adam was resurrected nearly thirty years later (by [[Dr. Sivana]]) in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' revival of the Marvel Family characters. In issue #28 of this series, we find out that Black Adam gets his powers from [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] (stamina), Hershef (strength), [[Amun|Amon]] (power), Zehuti ([[Thoth]]) (wisdom), [[Anpu]] (speed), and [[Menthu]] (courage). After several more defeats at Captain Marvel's hand, Adam joined [[Mister Mind]]'s final [[pre-Crisis]] version of the [[Monster Society Of Evil]]. Adam's origin was revised for the [[1987]] miniseries ''Shazam! The New Beginning'', in which the need for Captain Marvel to oppose him is made an integeral reason of why Billy Batson is recruited. Soon after that call, the corrupted champion is drawn from the netherworld by an interdimensional transport device created by [[Dr. Sivana]], whom Adam attempts to make his slave.

===''The Power of Shazam!''===

Black Adam was reintroduced to the DC Universe in ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' graphic novel by [[Jerry Ordway]] in [[1994]]. In that story and the subsequent ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series, Adam was a deadly and evil adversary for Captain Marvel.
[[Jerry Ordway]], the writer of ''The Power of Shazam!'', redefined Black Adam's origin for the Modern Age of comic books.

====Revised origin of Mighty Adam====
In this revised origin (told in ''Power of Shazam!'' #10), Teth-Adam was the son of the [[ancient Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]] [[Rameses II]], and impressed one of the high priests, the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], with his good deeds. The wizard had the young prince brought before him, and ordered him to speak his name. Teth-Adam did so, and was transformed into Mighty-Adam, a superhero possessing the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru ([[Horus]]), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of [[Aton]], and the courage of [[Mehen]]. 

Mighty-Adam served as Egypt's champion for many centuries, but became corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]] in disguise. Bewitched by Blaze, Adam became convinced that he and his mistress should rule the Egyptian kingdom, so he killed the Pharaoh and appointed himself ruler. Shazam was made aware of this treachery, and resultantly unleashed a powerful spell on Adam. The wizard extracted Mighty Adam's magic powers and encased them in a mystical scarab necklace, rendering Adam's depowered body, now several hundred years old, into a withered corpse.

Shazam then buried both the body and the scarab in the tomb of [[Rameses II]], where he had planned for it to remain for all eternity. In death, the former hero was referred to as "Khem-Adam" ("Black Adam"). Disillusioned by what he perceived as Adam's betrayal, Shazam went several millennia before appointing a second champion to fight evil in his name.

====Revised origin of Black Adam====
The original ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel (which predated the publication of the series by a year) explained how Black Adam was revived and introduced into the modern world. In this story, an unscrupulous archaeological aide named Theo Adam finds himself assigned to the Malcom Expedition, an archaeological dig financed by the [[Dr. Sivana|Sivana]] Foundation to excavate the tomb of Rameses II. Adam uncovers Khem-Adam's tomb in a secret passageway, and leads his superiors, C.C. Batson and his wife Marilyn, to the discovery. Upon first sight of Khem-Adam's scarab, Theo Adam became obsessed with the artifact, and killed both Batsons in order to steal it. Escaping [[Egypt]], Theo Adam soon made his way back to America.

The Batsons' son, Billy, had been left behind in the [[United States]], and was soon appointed to become Captain Marvel, the second champion of the wizard Shazam. When Theo Adam first encountered Captain Marvel, he noted both Marvel's identical appearance to C.C. Batson and the lightning-bolt insignia on Marvel's chest that had also  decorated Khem-Adam's tomb. Adam therefore had a revelation, and realized that he was a reincarnation of Khem-Adam. Grasping his stolen scarab, Adam spoke the wizard's Shazam's name and was transformed into the super-powered Black Adam. Black Adam revealed himself to Captain Marvel as the Batsons' killer, and the two battled. Captain Marvel emerged victorious by snatching Adam's scarab, and therefore his power, away from him. Marvel brought Theo Adam to Shazam, who wiped Adam's memory and took away his voice, so that he could not access his powers.

===''JSA'' series===
====Black Adam reforms====
[[Image:Cap_adam.jpg|thumb|Shazam's champions, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and Black Adam, on the cover of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' # 41 ([[2003]]). Art by [[Rags Morales]].]] Although Adam appeared during the ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series' first year of publication as a villain, towards the end of the series' run, Adam returned and announced that Black Adam and Theo Adam were separate personalities. Black Adam went on trial again for the murders of the Batsons, and was acquitted when it was revealed that his fingerprints did not match those of Theo Adam's.

The reformed Black Adam was still vulnerable to his murderous host's influence, and he attacked the [[Justice Society of America]] under Theo Adam's control in ''JSA'' #6 (1999). In subsequent issues, Adam joins supervillain [[Johnny Sorrow]]'s [[Injustice Society]] after Sorrow removed a malignant brain tumor from Adam's brain. Adam soon betrayed Sorrow, and he and the JSA defeated the Injustice Society. Claiming to be free of Theo's evil influence again, a redemptive Black Adam requested membership in the Justice Society, and was granted a probationary membership in ''JSA'' #21 (2002).

During his tenure in ''JSA'', writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[David S. Goyer]] redefined Adam's personality and background, focusing on the character's old-fashioned and militant ideals of justice, and his officious and strongly opinionated attitude. Several of the other JSA character were shown to be skeptical of Adam's reformation; primary among them was [[Atom Smasher]], who later became Adam's close friend. The writers also created added tension in the book by having Captain Marvel, who was wholly unconvinced that Adam had reformed, join the team. One ''JSA'' story arc (issues 39 through 44) features Marvel, [[Hawkgirl]], and [[Mr. Terrific]] venturing back in time to ancient Egypt, where they meet Mighty Adam before his corruption.

Johns and Goyer used this story arc to slightly alter Adam's origin. The hero now hailed from the fictional Arabian nation of [[Kahndaq]], not Egypt, although he served mightily for the Egyptian prince Khufu (who would later be reincarnated as JSA member [[Hawkman]]). The character of Blaze was completely removed from the origin story, and Adam's rage was described as having resulted from the conquering of Kahndaq (and the murder of his wife and children) at the hands of a magically powered supervillain named Ahk-ton. Mighty Adam killed Ahk-ton, and returned to Kahndaq to re-claim it by any means necessary, including murder. The wizard Shazam did not agree with Adam's actions, and robbed Adam of his powers and killed him.

====''Black Reign''====
[[Image:Jsablackreign.jpg|thumb|right|Kahndaq's rulers: Black Adam's vigilante group, on the cover art for JSA #56. Art by John Watson.]]
In ''JSA'' #45 (2003), Black Adam and his teammate [[Atom Smasher]] both defected from the Justice Society. During the next few issues, Adam formed his own organization, which would administer justice the way Adam wanted it: "an eye for an eye". His roster included a mix of DC heroes and villains, including Atom Smasher, [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]] (who was possessed by [[Mister Mind]]), former [[Infinity, Inc.]] member [[Northwind (comics)|Northwind]] and the rest of the society of Feithera, [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]], and the JSA's former museum curator Alex Montez, who had made himself the human host for the demon [[Eclipso]] after figuring out how to control the demon's power. Adam's collective executed Kobra, a villain who had been acquitted by the legal justice system. Adam then turned his attentions to his old homeland of Kahndaq.

Late 2003 began the publication of a ''JSA''/''Hawkman'' crossover story arc titled "Black Reign", written by Geoff Johns alone, which featured Adam and his militia's hostile takeover of Kahndaq (with obvious references to the [[United States]]' concurrent takeover of [[Iraq]]). A war soon broke out, with Adam, his comrades, and the Kahndaqi people on one side; and the Justice Society on the other. By the end of the arc, the JSA left Adam in control of Kahndaq, provided that he did not leave its borders. Only Northwind and Atom Smasher remained at his side. Brainwave had been saved by the JSA, Mister Mind was apprehended, and Nemesis and Alex were both killed during the war when Alex lost control of Eclipso, resulting in Nemesis beng killed by the demon and Alex killing himself so the demon couldn't continue to use him.

===''Infinite Crisis''===
As Kahndaq's ruler, Adam was depicted as fiercely working to protect his people and his nation. Black Adam was featured heavily in DC's 2005 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, primarily in the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] (which he only joined to protect Kahndaq from the Society). Concurrently, in ''JSA'', Atom Smasher left Adam's side to return to the JSA.

The Society was run by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from the alternate world [[Earth-3]], who disguised himself as the [[Lex Luthor]] of the post-Crisis Earth. The ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series centered around Alexander Luthor's plan to restore the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Multiverse]]. Needing a member of the Marvel Family to power the apparatus he'd designed to recreate the alternate earths of the Multiverse, Luthor has the Society betray and capture Black Adam. With the help of the mind-controlling powers of the [[Psycho-Pirate]], Luthor was able to control Adam and have him call down the magic Shazam lightning bolt to fuel the apparatus. By the end of the miniseries, Black Adam was freed by [[Kon-El|Superboy]] and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]. Adam then [[:Image:Deathpp.PNG|killed the Psycho-Pirate]] and, after a failed attempt to defeat [[Superboy-Prime]] (Where it was revealed that magic no longer affects Superboy-Prime due to him having changed at his very core), joined the heroes in the [[Battle of Metropolis]], destroying [[Amazo]] shortly after his arrival.

===''52''===
{{seealso|52 (comics)}}

{{spoilers}}

Black Adam currently appears as a featured character in DC's weekly ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' comic book. Depicted as the violent protector of the nation of Khandaq, Adam has killed several super-villains in public and on television to demonstrate his views. As a result, he is distrusted by several of the superheroes he claims a place beside, including [[Power Girl]] and [[Green Lantern]]s [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] and [[Hal Jordan]].

In the stories printed during the first ten weeks of the ''52'' series, Black Adam created a coalition, based on metahumans from [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Sonar (comics)|Modora]], [[Brother Blood|Zandia]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Russia]], against the perceived metahuman supremacy of the United States of America. He is actively increasing membership. In ''52'', DC introduced Adrianna Tomaz, a slave offered to Adam by [[Intergang]] as a token to curry his favor. Although Adam dealt harshly with the slavers, Adrianna becomes Adam's love interest, and her counsel proves wise to him. In week 12 of the series, Adam uses the magical Amulet of Isis, hidden on the scarab in which Shazam imprisoned him, for her to become the superheroine [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]]. Weeks later he proposes, and the two are married under the auspice of Captain Marvel and the rest of the Marvel Family.

In ''52'' Week 23, Black Adam and Isis, with the assistance of the Question and Renee Montoya, find Isis' brother Amon. Due to a failed esacape attempt, Amon suffers near-fatal wounds. In order to save his life Black Adam bestows a portion of his own power on the boy, as Captain Marvel did for [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]]. Isis' brother then becomes a new addition to the Marvel Family under the name [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Osiris,_Amon_Tomaz|Osiris]].

Osiris has since been accepted into the Teen Titans.  Upon returning from a mission, he and the rest of the Black Marvel family are attacked by the Suicide Squad.  Black Adam and his new family successfully defeat the Squad, but not before footage of them in battle is captured by Amanda Waller, who will surely use it to ruin the Black Marvel's reputations.

==Powers and abilities==
When Theo Adam says the magic word "Shazam" and is transformed into Black Adam, he is granted the following powers (which are derived not from the same Greco/Roman/Biblical figures as Captain Marvel, but from more ancient Egyptian gods):

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''S''' ||for the stamina of [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|'''S'''hu]] ||Using Shu's endurance, Black Adam can withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults. Additionally, he does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe and can survive unaided in space.

|-
|'''H''' ||for the swiftness of [[Horus|'''H'''eru]] ||By channeling Heru's speed, Black Adam can fly and move at supersonic speeds, and, in space, at faster than light speeds.

|-
|'''A''' ||for the strength of [[Amun|'''A'''mon]] ||Black Adam has a phenomonal level of super strength, able to easily bend steel, punch through walls and lift massive objects. Adam's strength is enough that he can hold his own against beings such as [[Superman]] or [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].
|-
|'''Z''' ||for the wisdom of [[Thoth|'''Z'''ehuti]] ||Black Adam has instant access to a vast level of scholarly knowledge. The wisdom of Zehuti also provides him with counsel and advice in times of need.
|-
|'''A''' ||for the power of [[Aton|'''A'''ton]]||Aton's power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Adam, also enhances Adam's other physical abilities, provides physical invulnerability and magic resistance against most magic spells and attacks, as well as allowing for interdimensional travel. Adam can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target.
|-
|'''M''' ||for the courage of [[Mehen|'''M'''ehen]] ||This aspect is primarily psychological, and gives Adam superhuman amounts of inner strength from which to draw.
|}

Additionally, Adam's senses are acutely sharpened (though not to the extent of Superman's).

Saying the magic word again will change Black Adam back into Theo Adam, although when the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] stripped him of his powers during the Black Vengeance affair, he reverted to Teth Adam, the ancient Khandaqi farmer who was Mighty Adam. However, Black Adam very rarely changes back to his non-powered form. Also, as Captain Marvel shares his powers with the rest of the Marvel Family, Adam's unshared powers are often depicted as rendering him somewhat stronger than the Captain.

==Other media==
Adam appeared as in a few episodes of the 1981 ''Shazam!'' Saturday morning cartoon, aired as one-half of ''[[The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam!]]''. Although he has not appeared in any other television programs or films, he was briefly mentioned by his alter-ego's name, Teth-Adam, during a flashback in the "Ancient History" episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.
