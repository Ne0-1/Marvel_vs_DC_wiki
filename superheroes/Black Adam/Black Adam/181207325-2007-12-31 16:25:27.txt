'''Black Adam''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character whose morally ambiguous nature has his character fall between the lines of [[hero]]ism and [[villain]]y; as a result, he has associated himself with both [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s at different times.  The character was originally created in [[1945]] for the premiere issue of [[Fawcett Comics]]' ''[[Marvel Family]]'' comic book by [[Otto Binder]] and [[C. C. Beck]] as an "evil" version of Fawcett's popular  [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] character. ''Marvel Family'' #1 was Adam's only appearance during Captain Marvel's Fawcett Comics run. Adam was later revived by [[DC Comics]] in the [[1970s]] ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' comic book, becoming Captain Marvel's most physically powerful foe. Originally called '''Teth-Adam''' (or '''Mighty Adam''') in [[ancient Egypt]], Black Adam is a previous appointee of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], but soon uses his power for his own corrupt ends, which forces the wizard to punish him. Generally, that punishment is to remove Adam from that time, only to appear in modern times to challenge Shazam's current appointee, Billy Batson, in his Captain Marvel form. 

By the early 21st century, Adam has been redefined by DC writers [[Jerry Ordway]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[David S. Goyer]] as a corrupted [[anti-hero]] attempting to clear his name. Adam's personal goal is to enforce justice; however, his ideals of justice, often involving hostile action or execution, are considered extreme by many of the heroes who have attempted to give the former supervillain a second chance. This current version of Black Adam is the former ruler of [[Kahndaq]], a fictional [[Middle East]]ern nation in the [[DC Universe]]. Featured roles in comic books series such as ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'', ''[[Villains United]]'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' have elevated the character to a level of prominence in DC Comics nearly surpassing that of Captain Marvel.

Adam is depicted as a powerful [[Arab world|Arab]] man wearing a costume similar to Captain Marvel's, except that the red portions are black, and Adam does not wear a [[cape]], although recent depictions of the character give him a black cape similar to the ones worn by the Marvel Family. Some artists, following C. C. Beck's original design, also depict Adam with pointed ears.

==Publication history==
===Fawcett Comics===
The original [[Fawcett Comics]] version of Black Adam, which appeared only once during the original Fawcett run of Captain Marvel comics, is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian prince named "Teth-Adam", who is chosen by the wizard Shazam to be his successor.
[[Image:Blackadamorigin.png|200px|Black Adam's origin. ''The Marvel Family'' # 1 (1945). Art by C. C. Beck and Pete Costanza.|thumb|left]]
When Adam says the magic word "Shazam", he is transformed into a super-powered being, Teth Adam (literally translating into "Mighty Human"). Possessing the same powers that Captain Marvel would later be granted, Adam is soon corrupted by the vastness of his powers. The wizard Shazam originally gives him ancient powers derived from Greco-Roman deities (Later stories establish that the names of gods from the Egyptian pantheon make up the the acronym ''Shazam'' for Black Adam).

Deciding that he should rule the world, Adam overthrows the [[pharaoh]] and assumes the throne. An angry Shazam gives his errant champion a new name -- "Black Adam" -- and banishes him to the most distant star in the universe.

Adam spends the next 5000 years flying back to Earth. By the time he makes it back, in [[1945]], Shazam has appointed three new champions to take his place: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Mary Marvel]], and [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] Adam does battle with the trio, known as the [[Marvel Family]], but since all are equally invulnerable, the fight goes on and on without resolution. At the suggestion of the wizard Shazam, [[Marvel Family#Marvel Family Allies|Uncle Marvel]] tricks Black Adam into saying the wizard's name, transforming him back into his mortal form. Adam's natural aging process takes hold, and he withers away into a skeleton within moments.

===DC Comics===
====Pre-Crisis and ''Shazam!: The New Beginning''====
While he is defeated in the same story in which he debuted, Adam is resurrected nearly thirty years later (by [[Doctor Sivana]]) in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' revival of the Marvel Family characters.  According to ''Shazam!'' #28, Black Adam gets his powers from [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] (stamina), Hershef (strength), [[Amun|Amon]] (power), Zehuti ([[Thoth]]) (wisdom), [[Anubis|Anpu]] (speed), and [[Menthu]] (courage). After several more defeats at Captain Marvel's hand, Adam joins [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]]'s final [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] version of the [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Monster Society Of Evil]]. Adam's origin is revised for the [[1987]] miniseries ''Shazam! The New Beginning'', in which the need for Captain Marvel to oppose him is made an integral reason of why Billy Batson is recruited. Soon after that call, the corrupted champion is drawn from the netherworld by an interdimensional transport device created by [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Sivana]], whom Adam attempts to make his slave.

==Fictional character biography==
===''The Power of Shazam!'': revised origin===
[[Image:Power-shazam-10-1995.jpg|right|thumb|180px|(Left to right) [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]], [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], and Black Adam, on the cover of ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' #10 (1995). Art by [[Jerry Ordway]].]]
Black Adam is reintroduced to the DC Universe in ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' graphic novel by [[Jerry Ordway]] in [[1994]]. In that story and the subsequent ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series, Adam is a deadly and evil adversary for Captain Marvel.

In this revised origin, Teth-Adam is the son of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]], and impresses one of the high priests, the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], with his good deeds. The wizard gives Teth-Adam the power to become the superhero Mighty-Adam by speaking the name "Shazam", an acronym for Mighty Adam's powers: the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru ([[Horus]]), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of [[Aten|Aton]], and the courage of [[Mehen]]. 

Mighty Adam serves as Egypt's champion for many centuries, but becomes corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]] in disguise. The bewitched Adam is convinced that he and his mistress should rule Egypt, so he  kills the Pharaoh and appoint himself ruler. Shazam learns of this treachery and strips Adam of his powers, encasing them in a mystical scarab necklace. Adam's depowered body rapidly experiences the aging process that the magic had staved off, and the former hero withers away into a dried [[wiktionary:cadaver|cadaver]] in seconds.  

Shazam buries both the body and the scarab in the tomb of [[Ramesses II]], where he plans for it to remain for all eternity. In death, the former hero is referred to as "Khem-Adam" ("Black Adam"). Disillusioned by what he perceived as Adam's betrayal, Shazam waits several millennia before appointing a second champion to fight evil in his name.

Thousands of years later, during the late 20th century, an unscrupulous archaeological aide named Theo Adam finds himself assigned to the Malcom Expedition, financed by the Sivana Foundation to excavate the tomb of Ramesses II. Adam uncovers Khem-Adam's tomb in a secret passageway, and leads his superiors, C. C. Batson and his wife Marilyn, to the discovery. Upon first sight of Khem-Adam's scarab, Theo Adam becomes obsessed with the artifact, and kills both Batsons in order to steal it. Escaping [[Egypt]], Theo Adam soon made his way back to America.

The Batsons' son, Billy, has been left behind in the [[United States]], and is drafted by Shazam to become the wizard's second champion, Captain Marvel. When Theo Adam first encounters Captain Marvel, he notes both Marvel's identical appearance to C. C. Batson and the lightning-bolt insignia on Marvel's chest that had also decorated Khem-Adam's tomb. Adam therefore has a revelation, and realizes that he is a reincarnation of Khem-Adam. Grasping his stolen scarab, Adam speaks Shazam's name and is transformed into the super-powered Black Adam. Black Adam reveals himself to Captain Marvel as the Batsons' killer, and the two battle. Captain Marvel emerges victorious by snatching Adam's scarab, and therefore his power, away from him. Marvel brings Theo Adam to Shazam, who wipes Adam's memory and takes away his voice, so that he can not access his powers. This solution proves temporary, as Blaze re-enters her former lover's life and helps restore his voice, his memory, and access to his powers.

===''JSA'' series: Black Adam reforms===
[[Image:Cap adam.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Artwork for the cover of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' # 41 ([[2003]]) featuring Shazam's champions, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and Black Adam. Art by [[Rags Morales]].]]
Although Adam appears during the ''Power of Shazam!'' ongoing series' first year of publication as a villain, towards the end of the series' run, Adam returns and announces that Black Adam and Theo Adam are separate personalities. Black Adam stands trial again for the murders of the Batsons, and is acquitted when it is revealed that his fingerprints do not match those of Theo Adam's.

The reformed Black Adam is still vulnerable to his murderous host's influence, and he attacks the [[Justice Society of America]] under Theo Adam's control in ''JSA'' #6 (1999). In subsequent issues, Adam joins supervillain [[Johnny Sorrow]]'s [[Injustice Society]] after Sorrow removes a malignant brain tumor from Adam's brain. Adam soon betrays Sorrow, and he and the JSA defeat the Injustice Society. Claiming to be free of Theo's evil influence again, a repentant Black Adam requests membership in the Justice Society, and is granted a probationary membership in ''JSA'' #21 (2002).

During his tenure in ''JSA'', writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[David S. Goyer]] redefined Adam's personality and background, focusing on the character's old-fashioned and militant ideals of justice, and his officious and strongly opinionated attitude. Despite this, he has stated on many occasions that he respects the Justice Society, particularly members such as [[Jay Garrick]]. Several other JSA members are shown to be skeptical of Adam's reformation; primary among them is [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], who later becomes Adam's close friend. The writers also created added tension in the book by having Captain Marvel, who is wholly unconvinced that Adam has reformed, join the team. One ''JSA'' story arc (issues 39 through 44) features Marvel, [[Hawkgirl]], and [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] venturing back in time to ancient Egypt, where they meet Mighty Adam before his corruption. During this visit, Mighty Adam is grateful to meet Captain Marvel, as Marvel's presence demonstrates that his legacy will survive him even with his children gone, and, when Marvel transformes back into Billy Batson, Adam expresses admiration for the young man's ability to handle the power of Shazam at such a young age, something he doubts he could have achieved himself.

Johns and Goyer used this story arc to slightly alter Adam's origin. The hero now hails from the fictional Arabian nation of [[Kahndaq]], not Egypt, although he serves for the Egyptian prince Khufu (who is later reincarnated as JSA member [[Hawkman]]). The character of Blaze is completely removed from the origin story, and Adam's rage is described as having resulted from the conquering of Kahndaq (and the murder of his wife and children) at the hands of a magically powered supervillain named Ahk-ton (whose powers resemble future hero [[Metamorpho]]), who is working with the notorious DC immortal [[Vandal Savage]]. Mighty Adam kills Ahk-ton during the struggle, and returns to Kahndaq to reclaim it by any means necessary, including murder. The wizard Shazam does not agree with Adam's actions, and robs Adam of his powers and kills him.

===''JSA: Black Reign''===
[[Image:Jsablackreign.jpg|180px|thumb|right|[[Kahndaq]]'s rulers: Black Adam's vigilante group, on the cover art for ''JSA'' #56.<br>Art by [[John Watson (comic book artist)|John Watson]].]]
In ''JSA'' #45 (2003), Black Adam and his teammate [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] both defect from the Justice Society. During the next few issues, Adam forms his own organization, which administers justice the way Adam wants it: "an eye for an eye". His roster includes a mix of DC heroes and villains, including Atom Smasher, [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]] (who is possessed by [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]]), [[Northwind (comics)|Northwind]] and the rest of the society of Feithera, [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]], and former JSA museum curator Alex Montez, the human host of the demon [[Eclipso]]. Adam's collective executes Kobra, a villain who has been acquitted by the legal justice system. Adam then turns his attentions to his old homeland of Kahndaq, now ruled by a militant dictator whose actions had long been ignored by the United Nations.

Late 2003 began the publication of a ''JSA''/''Hawkman'' crossover story arc titled "Black Reign", written by Geoff Johns alone, which features Adam and his militia's hostile takeover of Kahndaq. A war soon breaks out, with Adam, his comrades, and the Kahndaqi people on one side, and the Justice Society on the other. By the end of the arc, the JSA leaves Adam in control of Kahndaq, provided that he does not leave its borders, convincing him that he can't enforce his rule on the world or he is no better than the dictator he'd defeated. Brainwave is saved by the JSA, Mister Mind is apprehended thanks to the actions of [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|the Atom]], and Nemesis and Alex both die during the battle when Alex loses control of Eclipso. Only Northwind and Atom Smasher remain at Adam's side. As Kahndaq's ruler, Adam is depicted as fiercely working to protect his people and his nation. 

===''Infinite Crisis''===
Black Adam is featured heavily in DC's 2005 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover, primarily in the ''[[Villains United]]'' miniseries as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] (which he only joins to protect Kahndaq from the Society). Concurrently, in ''JSA'', Atom Smasher leaves Adam's side to return to the JSA.

The Society is run by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], a character from the alternate world [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], who disguises himself as the [[Lex Luthor]] of the post-Crisis Earth. The ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series centers around Alexander Luthor's plan to restore the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]. Needing a member of the Marvel Family to power the apparatus he has designed to recreate the alternate earths of the Multiverse, Luthor has the Society betray and capture Black Adam. With the help of the mind-controlling powers of the [[Psycho-Pirate]], Luthor is able to control Adam and have him call down the magic Shazam lightning bolt to fuel the apparatus; the Spectre's rampage during the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' storyline has reverted all magic in the DC Universe to a raw, chaotic structure, and the death of the wizard Shazam has transformed him into a tether that can be used to harness the magic and use it to power his equipment. By the end of the miniseries, Black Adam is freed by [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]. Adam, following a failed attempt to defeat [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]] (which reveals that magic does not affect Superboy-Prime, as Adam's blows allegedly only 'tickled'), joins the heroes- although he is generally regarded as being on his own side by the other combatants- in the Battle of Metropolis, destroying [[Amazo]] shortly after his arrival.

===''52''===
{{seealso|52 (comic book)}}
[[Image:52twelve.jpg|180px|left|Artwork for the cover of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' Week Twelve featuring Adam and [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]].<br>Art by [[J. G. Jones]].|thumb]]

Black Adam appears as a featured character in DC's weekly ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' comic book. Depicted as the violent protector of the nation of Khandaq, Adam kills several super-villains in public and on television to demonstrate his views. As a result, he is distrusted by the superhuman community. He creates an international metahuman coalition against the perceived metahuman supremacy of the United States. In ''52'', DC introduces Adrianna Tomaz, a slave offered to Adam by [[Intergang]] as a token to curry his favor. After Adam deals harshly with the slavers, Adrianna becomes Adam's love interest, and her counsel proves wise to him. In week 12 of the series, Adam uses a magical amulet, hidden on the scarab in which Shazam imprisoned him, to transform Adrianna into the superheroine [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]]. Weeks later he proposes, and the two are married under the auspice of Captain Marvel and the rest of the Marvel Family.

In ''52'' Week 23, Black Adam and Isis, with the assistance of [[Question (comics)|the Question]] and [[Renee Montoya]], find Isis' brother Amon. Due to a failed escape attempt, Amon suffers near-fatal wounds. In order to save his life Black Adam bestows a portion of his own power on the boy, as Captain Marvel did for [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] Isis' brother then becomes a new addition to the Marvel Family under the name [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Osiris, Amon Tomaz|Osiris]].

Osiris is accepted into the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Upon returning from a mission, he and the rest of the Black Marvel family are attacked by the [[Suicide Squad]]. The Black Marvels successfully defeat the Squad, but not before footage of them in battle (including Osiris' accidental killing of a Squad member) is captured by [[Amanda Waller]], who uses it to further ruin the Black Marvel Family's reputation. Meanwhile, Khandaq is struck with a number of natural disasters, which seem to have a supernatural origin.

Wracked with guilt over the death of the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]], Osiris ventures to the Rock of Eternity and pleads with Captain Marvel to have his powers removed, as he fears Black Adam's influence (and those of his gods) has tainted him with evil. Black Adam arrives and the two battle until subdued by Isis and the Marvels. Osiris relents and accompanies the Black Marvel Family back home, only to be betrayed and brutally devoured by his friend, the talking crocodile [[Sobek (comics)|Sobek]], while in his mortal form.

Isis and Adam confront Sobek, who reveals that he is Famine, the Fourth Horseman of [[Apokolips]], one of four creatures created by Intergang to attack Black Adam. Adam swiftly disposes of Sobek, and does battle with the other three Horsemen. One of them, Pestilence, infects Isis with a deadly disease before Adam kills him and his partner War. A gravely ill Isis saves Adam from Death using her powers, and tells Adam with her dying breaths that she was wrong to try to change his views on justice, and that he should avenge both her and Osiris.

====[[World War III (comics)|''World War III'']]====
[[Image:52weekfifty.jpg|180px|Cover to ''52'' Week Fifty. Art by J.G. Jones.|thumb]]
Seething with fury, Adam flies to the neighboring nation of [[Bialya]], where Death has taken refuge. Adam slaughters everyone within Bialya - the government, the army, and the citizens - while hunting for Death, whom he defeats in battle, then tortures the creature into revealing the whereabouts of its masters. Intent on revenge, Black Adam flies to Oolong Island, hideout of a coalition of evil DC Universe scientists who created the Horsemen. However, the scientists subdue him and he suffers weeks of torture at the hands of Dr. Sivana. The "[[52 (comic book)#The Science Squad|Science Squad]]" then announce to the world that they plan to sell Black Adam as a living weapon to the highest bidder. The Justice Society assaults the island, freeing Adam. It is revealed that [[Chang Tzu]] had built the Horsemen under orders of China, who wanted Adam and his family to be assassinated after Adam left the Freedom of Power Treaty. Adam refuses to be taken into custody and once more flies off, seeking revenge for the death of his family

Enraged to the point of madness, and with his gods' blessings, Black Adam flies to China, causing massive civilian casualties and billions of dollars in property damage when various superhumans get in his way. He tears through the ranks of the world's superhumans, killing [[Young Frankenstein (comics)|Young Frankenstein]] and [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], and seriously injuring several others. He attacks China, continuing the destruction until the decimated [[Great Ten]] allows the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] and a coalition of other metahumans onto Chinese soil. Captain Marvel, though unable to take away Black Adam's powers, works with a group of mystics, including [[Zatanna]] and the [[Phantom Stranger]], to transform Black Adam into the mortal Teth-Adam. Using his abilities as the new guardian of the Rock of Eternity, Marvel changes Adam's magic word from "Shazam" to an unknown one to prevent him from ever changing back. Despite his defeat, Teth-Adam escapes thanks to the intervention of his one-time ally [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]]. He is left a mortal wandering the Middle East, unsuccessfully guessing at the word that will restore his power.

===Black Adam: The Dark Age===
{{future comic}}
In this six-issue mini-series, which begins sometime after his defeat in World War III, the still-powerless Teth-Adam orders his remaining loyal minions to savagely beat his face in order to alter his physical appearance. Effectively disguised, he leads the group to Kahndaq to retrieve the bones of Isis, while the JSA is in Bialya searching for him. Adam and his men are attacked by unidentified soldiers (who are also searching for Teth-Adam) while leaving the tomb of Isis and Osiris. Adam's followers sacrifice their lives so that he can escape with his wife's remains. Adam then travels to the frozen Himalays, where he cannibalizes the corpse of his last henchman after running out of food. The text indicates that his henchman voluntarily sacrifices his body to keep Black Adam alive. This serves to indicate both Black Adam's undying dedication to resurrecting Isis as well as the equally powerful loyalty that his remaining followers had for him. 

Finally reaching a secluded cave, Teth Adam resurrects Isis using a [[Lazarus Pit]]. The process is imperfect however, and Isis' new skin decays and her body literally falls apart. Adam returns her to death to end her suffering. Teth-Adam then journeys to [[Doctor Fate]]'s tower, hoping to retrieve Isis' amulet. He encounters [[Felix Faust]], who offers his assistance in return for being freed from the tower, which he was trapped in by [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] during ''52''. It is also revealed here that Teth Adam's previous attempt at bringing Isis back at the Lazarus Pit failed because one of Isis's fingers was missing; an individual's remains must be fully intact for a [[Lazarus Pit]] to work properly. 

With Faust's help, Black Adam's power source is changed from his six patron gods to the residual mystic energy contained in Isis' corpse. "Isis" now works as his new magic word of transformation. Once again in his superhuman form, he sets off to retrieve the scattered pieces of Isis' amulet. Faust warns Adam that this is only a temporary solution, as every time he draws power from Isis' bones, they become more fragile and less able to sustain her resurrection.

In retrieving the first part of the amulet, Teth Adam encounters Hawkman. The two have a savage battle in the sky, leading to Hawkman's serious injury. After the fight, the [[Justice League]] is notified and the team begins trying to find Black Adam. Meanwhile, while resting at a riverbank and contemplating his mission to bring back his wife, Teth Adam is shot down and badly wounded by members of the same organization that attacked him in issue one. He is, however, strong enough to speak the magic word "Isis" and transform into Black Adam. After promptly dispatching the assassins with extreme prejudice, he visits a veterinary hospital to have his wounds repaired. 

After leaving the hospital, the doctors who save Teth Adam's life are attacked by the assassins. Teth Adam sees this happening, saves the two doctors, and kidnaps the two assassins. He kills them both, one by striking him with lightning and one by flying him up into the [[thermosphere]], after getting information from them. The [[Justice League]] talk to the two doctors as part of their hunt for Teth Adam, and learn about his heroic act of saving them from the assassins. This further develops Teth Adam's [[anti-hero]] character, as it is one of his first acts of heroism since the events of World War III.

===''Countdown''===
In ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #49 Adam appears with his powers restored, having secretly taken up residence in the abandoned Khandaq embassy in Gotham City. A depowered [[Mary Marvel]] stumbles upon him at the embassy and finds that he has killed several others that have had the misfortune to find their way into the building. It appears that Adam is about to harm Mary as well, but instead he utters the word "Shazam", transferring all of his powers to her (including those he inherited from Isis). He departs in his mortal form, telling her to tell Billy Batson "Sorry".

==Powers and abilities==
Previously, when Theo Adam says the magic word "Shazam" he is transformed into Black Adam and granted the following powers derived from ancient Egyptian gods. After his magic word is changed, [[Felix Faust]] allows him to leech power from Isis' remains for the same abilities. He has also gained the power of Isis, to unknown effect.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''S''' ||for the stamina of [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|'''S'''hu]] ||Using Shu's endurance, Black Adam can withstand and survive most types of extreme physical assaults. Additionally, he does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe and can survive unaided in space.

|}

Additionally, Adam's senses are acutely sharpened (though not to the extent of Superman's).

Black Adam has repeatedly been described as a warrior who had proven himself to be highly skilled even before he was given the power of SHAZAM.

Saying the magic word again initially changes Black Adam back into Theo Adam, although when the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] strips him of his powers during the Black Vengeance affair, he reverts to Teth Adam, the ancient Khandaqi farmer who was Mighty Adam. Subsequent depictions in the ''52'' series also show Teth Adam as Black Adam's default mortal identity. However, Black Adam very rarely voluntarily changes back to his non-powered form. 

Black Adam has been treated as slightly superior to Superman, as indicated by the Four Horsemen of Apokolips.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = 52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen|Issue = 2|Date = (September, 2007)|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref>.

==In other media==
Adam appeared in the "Black Adam's Return" episode of episode of the 1981 ''Shazam!'' Saturday morning cartoon, which aired as one-half of the ''[[Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam!]]''.  As in his original comic book appearance, he is tricked into saying "Shazam!", and turns to dust, presumably killing him. However, he returns in a later episode; this time, he is tricked into saying "Shazam" and is sent back to the days of ancient Egypt. He was voiced by [[Lou Scheimer]].

Although he has not appeared in any other television programs or films, the character is briefly mentioned by his alter-ego's name, Teth-Adam, during a flashback in the "Ancient History" episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. [[DC Direct]] has released two action figures of Black Adam, the most recent based on the work of artist [[Alex Ross]].

[[New Line Cinema]] is currently developing a ''Shazam!'' live-action feature film, with [[Peter Segal]] (''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]],'' ''[[50 First Dates]]'') as director and [[Michael Uslan]] as producer. Actor and former wrestler [[The Rock (entertainer)|Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]] has agreed to appear in the film as Black Adam <ref>Lee, Patrick.
