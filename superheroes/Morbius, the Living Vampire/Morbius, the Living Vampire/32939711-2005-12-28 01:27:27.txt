'''Morbius the Living Vampire''', full name Michael Morbius, is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], intended as a tragic [[anti-hero]] with vampire-like powers that actually had a biochemical origin.  Self-tormented over his nature but wanting to live, he has appeared as both as a villain and an ally in various [[Spider-Man]] titles, in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', and in his own self-titled comic book.  

Morbius first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #101 (October, 1971), teamed up with the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] against Spider-Man.  A [[flashback]] in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #102 revealed that Morbius was actually a [[Nobel prize]]-winning [[biochemist]] who attempted to cure himself of a rare blood disease with an experimental treatment involving [[vampire bat]]s and [[electroshock therapy]].  However, he instead became afflicted with a far worse condition that mimicked the powers and bloodthirst of legendary [[Vampires (Marvel Comics)|vampirism]].  Morbius now had to digest blood in order to survive and had a strong aversion to light.  He gained the ability to fly, as well as superhuman strength and healing abilities.  His appearance became hideous&mdash;his canine teeth extended into fangs, his nose flattened to appear more like a bat's, and his skin became chalk-white.  He also gained the ability to turn others into similar "living vampires" by biting them.  Though he managed at one point to cure himself of his pseudo-vampirism, he eventually reverted back to his altered form.

He gained his own series with ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #20 in 1975, and was the lead feature of that title for the rest of its thirty-one issue run.  He later received his own self-titled comic book series (as well as somewhat of a costume update) in 1992 as part of the "[[Rise of the Midnight Sons]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event between Marvel's supernatural/horror themed comics.  These later stories revealed that he also had a power to hypnotize others, and that his ability to fly is also psionic in nature.

Michael Morbius possesses a variety of superhuman powers similar to those possessed by "true", [[supernatural]] vampires in the Marvel Universe.  He possesses superhuman strength that varies with his feeding.  Under normal circumstances, Morbius is strong enough to lift roughly 1 ton.  If he has fed well, Morbius' strength has proven to be roughly equal to that of Spider-Man, who has been described in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' as capable of lifting approximately 10 tons.

Morbius possesses an accelerated healing ability and can recover from mild to moderate injuries at a rate beyond that of ordinary humans.  While not nearly as efficient as the healing powers possessed by the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Morbius has proven able to heal from multiple gunshot wounds in less than an hour.  More severe injuries, such as broken bones or severe burns, might take several days to heal, but once was shown to take minutes even though it left him as a near-mindless creature who must feed to replenish the energy that was used to do so, and he is unable to [[regeneration|regenerate]] missing limbs or organs, but Slaughter, another living vampire, has shown that a living vampire can reattach cut off parts of their body and survive a beheading if they have gained enough vitality from blood consumption.

Due to his vampire-like condition, Morbius is forced to ingest fresh blood on a regular basis to maintain his life and vitality.  How much blood he requires and how often he must feed has not been specified in the comics.  Those he bites also turn into "living vampires", and in more recent comics these transformed victims also gain the same full powers as Morbius possesses. Although not truly immortal like a true vampire, a living vampire may perhaps have a much longer life-span then a normal human, since blood is like an elixir to them.

Morbius does not possess any of the mystical vulnerabilities that supernatural vampires are subject to, such as to [[garlic]], [[holy water]], or [[silver]].  He is sensitive to sunlight, thanks to his photo-sensitive skin which prevents any protection from major sun burn, in contrast to "true" vampires that are incinerated by it.  Morbius also lacks the shapeshifting and weather control powers of vampires, and the ability to control animals.

However, like "true" vampires, Morbius does possess the ability to hyponotize others and bring them under his control, which can only be resisted by those possessing an extremely strong will.  Morbius can also fly through the air as a result of his psionic powers.
