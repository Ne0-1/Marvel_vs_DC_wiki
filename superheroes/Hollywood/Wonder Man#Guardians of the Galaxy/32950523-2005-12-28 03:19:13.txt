''This article is on the Marvel Comics character. For the DC character, see [[Wonder Man (DC Comics)]]''.  

'''Wonder Man''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and is a member in long standing of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''Avengers'' #9 (October 1964). The 1st penciler to draw him in a published comic was Don Heck.

==Character Biography==
Simon Williams was born the son of a rich family, and inherited the family's company and fortune.  Despite this, he embezzled money from the company and was caught.  The supervillain [[Baron Zemo]] found the desperate Williams and offered him a chance to escape by transforming him into the [[ionically|ion]]-powered Wonder Man.  

Wonder Man joined the Avengers on Zemo's behalf, but ultimately turned on Zemo and was apparently killed in doing so.  He actually remained in a deathlike state of [[suspended animation]] for years, during which time the [[android]] [[Ultron]] based the brain of an android of his own, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], upon that of Wonder Man. 

William's brother, Eric Williams, became the supervillain called the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], and the process that had empowered Simon was also used to empower the villain [[Count Nefaria]], among others.

Wonder Man was eventually revived as a zombie by Black Talon, by voodoo, and attacked the Avengers again. His body being made of ionic energy, or in the way to be so, was probably the factor why he was able to regain his own free will, and for his consciousness to finally re-emerge. He finally joined the Avengers full-time, becoming close friends with his teammate, the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and changed his costume including a period where he had a distinctive look with a turtleneck sweater under a short red [[trenchcoat]] with [[sunglasses]]. 

For some time after his "resurrection," Wonder Man suffered from two psychological problems. One--slight claustrophobia--was minor. The other was the far more serious fear of death; though he was not a coward, the thought of again being cut off from life was often crippling to him in battle. This fear made his Avengers service somewhat traumatic for him. In an attempt to find a less hazardous occupation, he sought work as an actor. In New York (where the Avengers are based), his career seemed forever stalled; he occasionally found work in stage plays, but more frequently found himself working on cable access shows. When he met Avengers reservist Hercules (during a time when the Avengers were reorganizing their membership rolls), the son of Zeus convinced him he had made many contacts in Hollywood who could help Williams to realize his dream; Wonder Man then travelled to Los Angeles with his new comrade. While Hercules was unable to help Wonder Man find acting work right away, Simon did find work as a stunt man, a job his invulnerability made him ideally suited for. Ironically, this work--undertaken to help him avoid danger--helped Wonder Man overcome his crippling fear, as repeated triumphs on the movie set allowed him to build up his confidence. The change in venue also led to Wonder Man become a founding and core member of the West Coast Avengers team, and eventually to greater success as an actor.

Wonder Man eventually came to accept the Vision as his "brother".  However, the Vision was dismantled and rebuilt as an emotionless machine, his memory erased by several governmental powers worldwide which were afraid of all the information contained in Vision's brain. Vision's marriage to Wanda Maximoff, the [[Scarlet Witch]], was annulled.

The Scarlet Witch asked Wonder Man for him to lend his brainwaves again for her lover to be reborn, but Wonder Man refused, having feelings for her which he could never really voice, and hoping this was his chance. She became mad at his refusal, and used her powers to throw a mountain at him which did not hurt anything but his feelings, sending him hurling and screaming into the airless space in which he is able to survive.

Wonder Man became romantically involved with the Scarlet Witch when she "resurrected" him (see below).

When the Avengers West Coast disbanded Williams became a founder member of its successor group - [[Force Works]], along with the Scarlet Witch. However, Wonder Man was disintegrated in a battle with the alien [[Kree]] in an early mission with the group.

The Scarlet Witch was eventually able to restore Williams to life with her [[chaos magic]], and love, and in the process brought back the Grim Reaper, who at the time had been a [[ghost]].  

Although Williams and Maximoff resumed their relationship, they eventually drifted apart and Wonder Man has recently been romantically linked with [[Carol Danvers]].

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Wonder Man possessed [[superhuman]] strength and endurance that were comparable with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. After his first "death", his powers increased significantly while in stasis, placing him in the "Class 100" strength range, equivalent to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]; entailing that he can lift far in excess of 100 tons. Wonder Man also possesses superhuman speed but initially could not fly of his own power. After his revival, he gained a belt that featured a pair of rockets that tapped into his ionic power to give him the ability of flight.  Without the belt, he could not fly, but eventually learned to leap great distances like the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. After he was exposed to the energies of a Nega-Bomb in "[[Operation Galactic Storm]]", his powers entered a state of flux that lasted until his second "death" in combat with the Kree. At one point during this state of flux, energy erupted from his body and temporarily empowered a group of his non-superpowered friends and associates, who were briefly known as the "[[Crazy Eight (comics)|Crazy Eight]]". During an epic battle against Mephisto, the devil, he learned that his body made of ionic energy was able to do far more than he first fathomed. Among other things, he learned that he could fly by himself by projecting energy from his lower body. After that, he was "killed" by the Kree (see bio above and trivia below), and his atoms were dispersed worldwide. His body was later reformed by the Scarlet Witch, by her love and her chaos magic, and was now clearly in its natural state : a form of energy, allegedly ionic energy.

==Trivia==
Even though Wonder Man has seemingly "died" numerous times, he is actually immortal because his body is made of ionic energy and no longer ages. When he was shot and "killed" the second time, by the Kree, all they succeeded in doing was to disperse his atoms worldwide. Also, he doesn't need to breathe, drink or eat, or maybe even sleep, but does so out of habit, not having known for a number of years that his body was made of ionic energy, or does so for general enjoyment of the pleasures of life. Because his body is made of ionic energy, Wonder Man's eyes glow bright red. He can consciously revert his eyes back to human-looking state through concentration (Simon's human eye color is grey), but only temporarily. We can assume his current natural form to be his "energized" one, and his "human" form to be "worn" out of habit of his human life.

In a future world of the millenium 3000, possibly ours, possibly another parallel reality, there is a Wonder Man now calling himself only Hollywood. There was a war, on earth, some centuries before, the Martians invaded, and Wonder Man was teleported by Vision away from earth so he could not help against the Martian invasion. Wonder Man insisted Vision teleported him back on earth which he did, but it was too late, the earth had lost, and Hollywood would share the weight of this fact with a way too rational Vision for centuries to come.
