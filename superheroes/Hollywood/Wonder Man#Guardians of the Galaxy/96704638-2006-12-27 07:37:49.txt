'''Wonder Man''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] and a long-time member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  Wonder Man was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #9 (October 1964).  

==Fictional character biography==

Simon Williams was the son of a rich industrialist and the owner of Williams Innovations. Over time the company's profits fell due to its biggest competitor, [[Tony Stark]]. On the advice of his brother Eric, Williams tries to embezzle funds from his company but is caught and incarcerated. Williams blames Stark for his failure, and readily accepts the proposition of master villain [[Baron Zemo]], who requires a pawn to infiltrate the Avengers. The desperate Williams agrees, and after being freed is transformed into an [[ion]] - powered being. Called Wonder Man by Zemo, Williams is then sent to meet and join the Avengers, with instructions to betray them at a critical moment. Zemo ensures Wonder Man's loyalty by advising him that as a result of the treatment his body now requires periodic doses of a serum to surive - a serum that only Zemo can provide. 

The plan fails when Wonder Man decides to save the Avengers, apparently at the cost of his own life. [[Iron Man]] - Tony Stark's alter ego - records Wonder Man's brain patterns in the hope that one day he can be revived. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #3</ref> Unknown to the Avengers, Wonder Man's body has simply entered a catatonic state as it adjusts to the effects of the treatment. Eric Williams becomes distraught over the apparent death of his sibling, and blaming the Avengers assumes the identity of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] in an effort to destroy them. The Grim Reaper attacks the Avengers three times before Wonder Man finally returns. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #52, 79, 102 + 107 - 108</ref>

== Resurrection ==

Wonder Man remains in [[suspended animation]] for years, and it is during this period that [[Ultron]], the evil robot creation of [[Henry Pym]], steals the brain patterns recorded by the Avengers for use as a template for the synthezoid [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #57 - 58</ref> (the Vision is eventually revealed to be [[Human Torch (Jim Hammond)|the original Human Torch]], an android created by Professor [[Phineas Horton]]. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #134 - 135</ref> This, however, only happened in mainstream continuity and other origins were possible courtesy of the Forever Crystal of [[Immortus]]). <ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1 - 12 (1998 - 1999)</ref>

During this vulnerable time, Wonder Man is used as pawn on three occasions. Wonder man is briefly revived by [[Kang the Conqueror]] to battle the Avengers as part of his [[Legion of the Unliving]], <ref>''Avengers'' Vol.1, #131 - 132</ref> and later ressurrected as a zombie by [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] and the Grim Reaper to attack the Avengers once more. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #152</ref> On the final occasion the Living Laser hypnotises a now awake but still very weak Wonder Man in an unsuccessful attack on the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, Annual #6 </ref> After this encounter Wonder Man chooses to remain with the Avengers, and soon after defeats the Grim Reaper, who was intent on destroying the Vision as he was "artificial" and a "mockery" of his brother. <ref>Avengers Vol. 1, #160</ref>

== Avenging Days ==
[[Image:WonderMan.jpg|left|thumb|The first appearance of Wonder Man in ''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #9. Art by [[Jack Kirby]]]]
Wonder Man eventually joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity, and becomes close friends with his teammate, the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. For several months after his resurrection, Wonder Man suffers from slight [[claustrophobia]] and a fear of dying in battle, as he did once before. Wonder Man finally overcomes his fear of death during the final battle with [[Korvac]]. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #177</ref> Developing an interest in acting, Wonder Man started in minor roles before moving to Hollywood, where fellow Avenger [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] used his contacts to establish Wonder man's career. <ref>The beginning of this relationship is seen in ''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #211</ref> Wonder Man also worked for a time as a stuntman, a vocation considered ideal as he is invulnerable. <ref>Mentioned by the Vision at the conclusion of ''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #250</ref>

Wonder Man joins the [[West Coast Avengers]], and his new-found confidence begins to become arrogance. He develops a serious rivalry with Iron Man, but sees the error of his ways after a brutal battle with the [[Abomination]]. <ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 1, #25</ref> Wonder Man eventually accepts the Vision as his "brother", there is a setback when the Vision is dismantled and rebuilt as an emotionless machine by a global conglomeration. The [[Scarlet Witch]] - the Vision's wife - asks Wonder Man to provide his brainwaves once again, but Wonder Man refuses, having feelings for her himself. <ref>''Avengers West Coast'' Vol. 1, #42 - 45</ref>

== Dead Again ==

When Avengers West Coast (renamed) disbands after a dispute, Wonder Man becomes a founder member of its successor group - [[Force Works]]. <ref>''Force Works'' Vol. 1, #1</ref> Soon after this an accident in space changes Wonder Man into a being of pure ionic energy,  <ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 2, #9</ref> and during a related mission against the alien [[Kree]] Wonder Man is disintegrated in an explosion. 

== Another resurrection ==

Many months later the Scarlet Witch accidentally resurrects Wonder Man in ionic form, who appears when she is in need. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 3, #3</ref> Several months later the Scarlet Witch is able to fully revive Wonder Man and he now exists in an independent, more human form. It is also discovered later that the Grim Reaper - dead at the time - is also revived. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 3, #10 - 11</ref> Wonder Man becomes romantically involved with the Scarlet Witch, but end their affair during a global war against Kang. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 3, #45 - 55</ref> Wonder Man at present being blackmailed into working for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to support the Superhuman Registration Act. <ref>Civil War  #1 - 6 (2006)</ref> 

Wonder Man also currently features in a mini-series written by [[Peter David]]. Wonder Man will also feature in the upcoming title [[Mighty Avengers]], a New Avengers spin-off team debuting early in 2007.

==Powers and abilities==

While Zemo's initial aim was to use ionic energy treatments to make Wonder Man at least as strong as [[Henry Pym |Giant Man]], the treatment surpassed Zemo's expectations as it gave Wonder Man strength comparable to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Wonder Man also acquires "instantaneous reflexes", superhuman speed <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #211</ref> and extreme durability. Although Wonder Man initially used a short range rocket belt provided by Zemo to fly, he later acquired the ability to fly through ionic propulsion.

In ionic form Wonder Man has in addition to strength, speed and flight. Wonder Man existed in this form as a "wraith" once revived by the Scarlet Witch, and would appear whenever needed. The Scarlet Witch was later capable of restoring Wonder Man to his more human form, although he is still capable of shifting into ionic form if necessary.

== Alternate Version ==
==MC2==

In the [[MC2]] Universe, Wonder Man was never revived after initially dying to save the Avengers, with robotic copies being utilised instead. <ref>''A-Next'' Vol. 1, #1 - 12</ref>

== Other Media ==

Wonder Man appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' animated series, voiced by Hamish McEwan.
