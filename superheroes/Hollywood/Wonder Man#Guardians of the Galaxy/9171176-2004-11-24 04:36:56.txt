'''Wonder Man''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and is a member in long standing of [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].

Simon Williams was born the son of a rich family, and inherited the family's company and fortune.  Despite this, he embezzled money from the company and was caught.  The supervillain [[Baron Zemo]] found the desperate Williams and offered him a chance to escape, by transforming him into the [[ion]]ically-powered Wonder Man.  Wonder Man joined the Avengers on Zemo's behalf, but ultimately turned on Zemo and was apparently killed in doing so.  He actually remained in a deathlike state of [[suspended animation]] for years, during which time the [[android]] [[Ultron]] based the brain of an android of his own, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], upon that of Wonder Man.  Simon's brother, Eric, became the supervillain called the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], and the process that had empowered Simon was also used to empower the villain [[Count Nefaria]].

Wonder Man was eventually revived and finally joined the Avengers full-time, becoming close friends with his teammate, the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].  With his zest for life, he became an [[actor]] in addition to a superhero, and was one of the major members of the West Coast Avengers team.  Wonder Man eventually came to accept the Vision as his "brother".  However, the Vision was dismantled and rebuilt as an emotionless machine, and his marriage to Wanda Maximoff, the [[Scarlet Witch]], was annulled.  Wonder Man later became romantically involved with the Witch.  However, the West Coast Avengers soon disbanded, and Simon was subsequently disintegrated in battle with the alien [[Kree]].  The Scarlet Witch was eventually able to restore Simon to life with her [[chaos magic]], and in the process brought back the Grim Reaper, who at the time had been a [[ghost]].  Simon and Wanda resumed their relationship.

{{spoiler}}

The relationship between Wonder Man and the Scarlet Witch recently ended as she went insane, apparently killing the Vision and several other Avengers.
