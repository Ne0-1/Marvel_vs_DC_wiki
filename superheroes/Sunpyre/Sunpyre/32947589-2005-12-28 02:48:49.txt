'''Sunpyre''' (real name '''Leyu Yoshida''') is a [[fictional character]] of the [[Marvel Universe]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. She is the sister of [[Sunfire]].

==Character biography==
Leyu Yoshida and her brother Shiro were born to a mother who suffered [[radiation poisoning]] due to exposure to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. As a result, she and her brother were born [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]], possessing identical powers. Her brother would go on to be the well-known Japanese superhero Sunfire.

Leyu first appeared, during the [[Eve of Destruction (comics)|Eve of Destruction]] storyline, when she joined the [[X-Men]] for a single mission, to help fight [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. She went in place of her brother, who was unavailable at the time.

[[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] later requested her to join his [[X-Corps]] (again replacng Sunfire, who didn't want to join). She served with the team until she was apparently killed when members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] hijacked the group. However, she reappeared alive and well in '''[[Alpha Flight]]''' vol. 3 #9 (January, 2005).  She had even replaced her brother among the [[Big Hero Six]]. No explanation has been offered of her apparent [[resurrection]].

She addressed her new teammate [[Honey Lemon]] as her "beloved". The implication being that the two women are romantically involved.
