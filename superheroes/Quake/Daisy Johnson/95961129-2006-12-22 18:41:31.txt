'''Daisy Johnson''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], superpowered [[secret agent]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A member of the international [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], she was created by [[writer]] [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[artist]] [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]], and [[first appeared]] in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #1 (April 2004).

Her look was modelled after [[actress]] [[Angelina Jolie]] in the [[film]] ''[[Foxfire (1996 film)|Foxfire]]''.<ref>Notes. ''Secret War'' collected hardcover edition.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Although she is often thought to be a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with seismic ([[earthquake]]-producing) ability, her powers come from her status as the illegitimate daughter of Calvin Zabo, the [[supervillain]] known as [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mr. Hyde]] (like certain other progeny of Marvel mutants, her genetics changed post-conception). Taken in by S.H.I.E.L.D. she is under the direct supervision of its longtime executive director, [[Nick Fury]], even after the latter's defection from the agency during the events of the "Secret War" intracompany crossover event. She possesses a "Level 10" security clearance, the only known agent aside from Fury to do so.

In her most visible action, Johnson has helped to defeat the powerful mutant rebel leader [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] by inducing a vibration in his brain that made him lose consciousness. She states in this appearance that if the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] let her join, she would adopt the moniker "'''Quake'''".
