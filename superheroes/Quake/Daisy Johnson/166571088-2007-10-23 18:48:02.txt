'''Daisy Johnson''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], superpowered [[secret agent]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A member of the international [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], she was created by [[writer]] [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[artist]] [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]], and [[first appeared]] in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #1 (April 2004).

Her look was modelled after [[actress]] [[Angelina Jolie]] in the [[film]] ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]''.<ref>Notes. ''Secret War'' collected hardcover edition.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Although she is often thought to be a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with seismic ([[earthquake]]-producing) ability, her powers come from her status as the illegitimate daughter of Calvin Zabo, the [[supervillain]] known as [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] (like certain other progeny of Marvel mutants, her genetics changed post-conception). Taken in by S.H.I.E.L.D. she is under the direct supervision of its longtime executive director, [[Nick Fury]], even after the latter's defection from the agency during the events of the "Secret War" intracompany crossover event. She possesses a "Level 10" security clearance, the only known agent aside from Fury and the Black Widow (Natasha Romanova) to do so.

In her most visible action, Johnson has helped to defeat the powerful mutant rebel leader [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] by inducing a vibration in his brain that made him lose consciousness. She states in this appearance that if the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] let her join, she would adopt the moniker "'''Quake'''".
