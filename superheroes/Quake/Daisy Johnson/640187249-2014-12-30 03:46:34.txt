==Fictional character biography==
Johnson, a superhuman with seismic ([[earthquake]]-producing) powers, is the illegitimate daughter of Calvin Zabo, the [[supervillain]] known as [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]]. She possesses a "Level 10" security clearance, the only known agent aside from Fury and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanova) to do so. Taken in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], she is under the careful eye of its longtime executive director, [[Nick Fury]], even after the latter's defection from the agency during the events of the ''Secret War'' series. Daisy herself was a participant in this incident, where Fury used trickery, lies and outright brainwashing in order to secure a superhero team to overthrow the legitimate government of [[Latveria]]. This later resulted in a terror attack on American soil; Daisy destroys the cyborg leader.<ref>"Secret Wars" #1-5 (Feb. 2004 - Dec. 2005)</ref>

In her most visible action, Johnson has helped to defeat the powerful mutant leader [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] by inducing a vibration in his brain that made him lose consciousness. This was during a three way confrontation with the X-Men, Avengers and the "Collective" a powered being carrying thousands of mutant energy signatures. Daisy states in this appearance that if she were to join the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], she would adopt the moniker "Quake".<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #20 (August 2006)</ref>

The Avengers had splintered due to the events of [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], and she is later seen reunited with Nick Fury, in disguise, who gives her new orders to recruit the descendants of various villains and heroes in order to assist him with the threat against the [[Skrull]]s in their [[Secret Invasion]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #13</ref> Taking on the name Quake, she and her teammates attack the Skrulls during their invasion of Manhattan.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #4</ref> The team becomes a part of Fury's [[Secret Warriors]], with Daisy acting as field leader of the Caterpillars.

While investigating [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s escape from the Raft, Johnson is drafted by [[Captain America]] into the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] under her superhero name Quake. She is tasked with tracking down how Osborn appeared via hologram in the middle of a supposedly secure press conference.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #19 (Jan. 2012)</ref> Daisy takes over as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when Nick Fury fully retires and his [[Nick Fury, Jr.|son]] joins as an agent.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #6 (June 2012)</ref> [[Maria Hill]] is the Acting Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #1 (Nov 2012)</ref><ref>''New Avengers'' #31 (October 2012)</ref> while Johnson is still considered Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #1 (February 2013)</ref> Johnson was indefinitely suspended after launching an unsanctioned operation to assassinate [[Andrew Forson]], the Scientist Supreme, leader of the supposedly legitimate [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M. Island]]. Hill is promoted to Director in her place.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 1 #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Daisy generates powerful waves of vibrations which can produce effects resembling those of earthquakes. She is immune to any harmful effects of the vibrations. She also has or was given a form of psychic shielding.

She's also a superb hand-to-hand combatant, skilled all-around athlete, and excellent marksman. She was a leading espionage agent, adept at undercover assignments.

Her training under Fury enables her to target her seismic waves with pinpoint accuracy, causing targeted objects to vibrate themselves apart, from the inside out. This is shown in her being able to prevent the detonation of an antimatter bomb implanted in the body of Lucia von Bardas by destroying its power supply, and exploding the heart of Wolverine while in his chest, to halt an enraged attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury.
