'''She-Hulk''' ('''Jennifer Walters-Jameson''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[Superhero|superheroine]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Savage She-Hulk'' #1 ([[1980#February|February 1980]]).

She-Hulk has been a member of both the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].  A highly skilled lawyer, she has served as legal counsel to various superheroes on numerous occasions.

==Publication history==
At the one-year anniversary of the character, She-Hulk made a guest appearance in ''Spidey Super Stories'' # 50 (January 1981). ''Spidey Super Stories'' was a Spider-Man title marketed to children just learning to read. She-Hulk later met Spider-Man for the first time in the regular Marvel Universe in a ''Marvel Team-Up'' #107 (July 1981) in a story that seems to fit between issues #16 and 17 of the ''Savage She-Hulk'' series (published in May and June of 1981). That chronology is suggested by the behavior of Jennifer Walters' nemesis Assistant District Attorney Buck Bukowski, in spite of the fact the ''Savage She-Hulk'' issues in question were published right before the ''Marvel Team-Up'' issue.  

The ''Savage She-Hulk'' series lasted until 1982 where it ended with #25 (March 1982). A few months later, the She-Hulk appeared in ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #88 (June 1982), in which she tried to seduce the Thing and helped him stop a supervillain who attacked a power plant. She also appeared in a three-issue limited series, [[Contest of Champions|''Marvel Super Heroes Contest of Champions'']] (June to August 1982), in which numerous superheroes were kidnapped from Earth to fight in [[outer space|space]]. That miniseries was sort of a low-rent predecessor of the more expansive, 12-issue ''Secret Wars'' miniseries a few years later. She-Hulk's main participation in ''Contest of Champions'' was a fight in issue #2 (July 1982). 

Shortly after her post- ''Savage She-Hulk'' guest appearances, the She-Hulk became a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], in ''Avengers'' #221 (July 1982). Although ''Contest of Champions'' continued until August of that year, it was obvious that She-Hulk was not yet an Avenger during that miniseries' storyline. 

She-Hulk joined the Avengers at the same time that Hawkeye rejoined. She also made occasional guest appearances in ''The Incredible Hulk'', such as ''Incredible Hulk'' #282 (April 1983). Then, at the conclusion of the first ''Secret Wars'' miniseries, she joined the Fantastic Four in ''Fantastic Four'' #265 (April 1984). Avengers #243 (May 1984) also records the She-Hulk's return to Earth as a member of the Fantastic Four at the conclusion of the Secret Wars.

During She-Hulk's tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18 in November 1985.

She regained a solo series in 1989, ''The Sensational She-Hulk''. Two issues from that run have generated controversy. Issue 34 of that run is a spoof of the Demi Moore Vanity Fair cover from 1991. Further controversy was generated in issue 40. She-Hulk stars in a nude jump-rope issue. 
It has lead to that issue being one of the hardest to find comics of the modern era.

In 1990 she appeared in the two-issue ''She-Hulk: Ceremony''. ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' lasted until issue #60 in February 1994, making it the longest-running She-Hulk series so far, and in fact the longest-running solo title of any female Marvel character up to that point, which lasted until [[Spider-Girl]] #61 in 2003.  The She-Hulk retained her membership with the Avengers throughout the run of ''Sensational She-Hulk'', 

After the cancellation of her second solo series, the She-Hulk continued making backup and one-shot appearances -- such as in ''Marvel Fanfare'' (December 1989) and ''Avengers Unplugged'' #4 (April 1996) -- and made appearances in ''The Incredible Hulk'' (including December 1993) and ''The Avengers'', plus a guest-starring role in a 1996 miniseries, ''[[Doc Samson]]''. Her next major appearance was in May 2002, a one-shot called ''Thing and She-Hulk: The Long Night''.

In 2004 ''She-Hulk'' was given a new title and launched in a wave of six new Marvel books. Despite favorable critical notices the new series could not escape the low sales numbers that both it and other titles received from their initial cluster-style launch. Marvel decided to give the book a second chance to find an audience.  With a relaunch planned 8 months later, Marvel brought the series to a close with #12 and promised a relaunch of the title (as a "second season") eight months later.  The eight month gap was alluded to in the body of the story itself.

Eight months later, like clockwork, the book returned as promised in October 2005, with the original creative team (Dan Slott and Juan Bobillo) from the previous series. The third issue was billed as the 100th issue of a She-Hulk comic book, and it had story art by numerous artists who sported their own interpretations of the character's looks. Among them was seminal She-Hulk artist, Mike Vosburg (who drew "Savage She-Hulk" #2 through #25). There was no new artwork by '80s and '90s She-Hulk legend John Byrne, but he was represented by featuring a complete reprint of his first solo issue of "Sensational She-Hulk."  A reprint of "Savage She-Hulk" #1 was also included, featuring the story by Stan Lee and art of John Buscema.

==Fictional character biography==
Jennifer Walters, the [[cousin]] of [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner (The Incredible Hulk)]], is the small and somewhat shy daughter of Los Angeles County [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff]] Morris Walters.  Agents of Nicholas Trask, a [[mafioso|crime boss]] who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on a day that Bruce Banner happened to be in town for a visit.  Since no donors of her [[blood type]] were available, Banner provided blood for a transfusion; his [[radioactive]] blood transformed Jennifer into the green-skinned She-Hulk.  

As She-Hulk, Jennifer possessed [[metahuman|powers]] similar to those of her cousin, though at a reduced level.  She also possessed a less monstrous, more [[Amazons|amazonian]] appearance. Jennifer's early adventures were chronicled in the [[1980]] Marvel Comics series ''The Savage She-Hulk'' which, following the first issue, were written by [[David Anthony Kraft]].

Although initially uncontrolled while in her form as She-Hulk, she eventually gained the same levels of intelligence she possessed as Jennifer Walters. By the time of the character's first anniversary, she had made a guest appearance in ''Spidey Super Stories'',  and was lucid enough to encourage the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to seek a fair trial for an alleged crime he had committed. Jennifer Walters quickly came to appreciate the confidence and assertiveness that came with being She-Hulk. At this point in her character development, she felt more comfortable in her form as She-Hulk than in her "normal" form as Jennifer.  After a brief solo career, she joined [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and temporarily replaced the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in the [[Fantastic Four]].  

[[Image:She-hulk.jpg|left|thumb|Cover to ''Fantastic Four'' #275, featuring She-Hulk.]]

During her tenure with the Fantastic Four, the She-Hulk had to prevent a radiation leak in a downed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Helicarrier. This radiation exposure had a drastic effect on Jennifer: she could no longer transform back into her original form. However, this was an agreeable turn of events for her, since she preferred being She-Hulk, and it was revealed much later that the block was purely psychological.

After her Fantastic Four years, She-Hulk rejoined the Avengers and began working for [[district attorney (county)|District Attorney]] Blake Tower.  Here she met Louise "Weezi" Mason, formerly the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroine called the [[Blonde Phantom]].  She-Hulk later discovered that Mason had manipulated Towers into hiring her, so that Mason might again star in a comic book (and thus avoid dying of old age). Later, while doing legal work for [[Heroes for Hire]], She-Hulk spent some time dating [[Luke Cage]].

She-Hulk currently practices law in the Superhuman Law division of the New York firm of [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]] (GLK&H).  (The law firm's name incorporates the names of the founding fathers of Marvel Comics: publisher Martin Goodman; publisher, writer, and creator Stan Lee, [whose original surname was Lieber]; and artist Jack Kirby, [whose original surname was Kurtzberg].)  While practicing at GLK&H, Jennifer gradually became comfortable as both She-Hulk and Jennifer Walters, realizing that she has much to offer the world in both forms.

She-Hulk has registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, and is a supporter of Tony Stark (Iron Man). However, as an attorney, she has advised individuals on both sides of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. She agreed to file suit against Peter Parker for fraud on behalf of her father-in-law, ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her intention is to keep the suit tied up in the courts indefinitely. She is also the lawyer for [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]] in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]''.

In ''She-Hulk'' #14 (2006),[[Clay Quartermain]], a [[SHIELD]] Agent, shows up in Jennifer's apartment to inform her that she has been drafted as a [[SHIELD]] agent as a result of her registration.

==Powers and abilities==
In her She-Hulk form, Jennifer possesses [[superhuman]] strength. When she transforms back and forth, she gains/loses considerable mass (much of it muscle).

As She-Hulk, Walters is proportionally stronger than she is in her Jennifer Walters form.  This means that any extra strength gained as Jennifer Walters through intense physical training will be amplified, making her She-Hulk form exponentially stronger. She used this exponential strength and training to her advantage when she fought the [[Champion of the Universe]] on an alien world (where court cases were decided through [[boxing]] matches).  While Jennifer Walters' training resulted in her becoming a bit more toned, She-Hulk's musculature, in contrast, became much more pronounced.  As a result, she donned a special strength-controlling bodysuit to replace her business clothes, which no longer fit her frame.  Walters subsequently shed some of that muscle mass during a work hiatus, but since first becoming She-Hulk, her strength has increased.  During the Avengers story arc "The Search For She-Hulk", it was established that fear also increases her strength. The upper limits of her strength are unknown but are still believed to be well below that of the Hulk's.

Thanks to training by the [[Ovoid (comics)|Ovoid]] alien race, She-Hulk can exchange her physical characteristics and powers with the physical characteristics and powers of another being by simply focusing on a mental image of the person and willing the transfer to take place. The actual intent of the Ovoid skill is to exchange the ''minds'' of the user and another being, but it was theorized by the Ovoid who trained the She-Hulk that some factor of her gamma-mutated physiology causes her use of this talent to manifest in a different way.  She rarely uses this power; unless she initiates this exchange with another superhuman being, she will become basically human in ability, but still green-skinned and generally recognizable as She-Hulk, and thus vulnerable to attack (a fact that the super-villainess [[Titania (comics)|Titania]] took advantage of the one time She-Hulk did use this ability).

She-Hulk's legal practice requires her to spend extended periods of time as Jennifer Walters.   The [[Scarlet Witch]] cast a spell for her which rendered anyone intending to harm the She-Hulk incapable of recognizing her as Jennifer Walters.  However, the spell actually rendered Jennifer Walters completely undetectable to these individuals.  While this had its advantages, it also left Jennifer unable to communicate with certain people whose knowledge or information it was vital for her to acquire.  The spell was eventually removed by Dr. Stephen Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme of the Marvel Universe.

===Skills===
[[image:She hulk 7 cover.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Promotional art for ''She-Hulk'' #7. Art by Mike Mayhew.]]

She-Hulk is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by [[Captain America]] and [[Gamora]]. Even in her Jennifer Walters form, she possesses sufficient skill in the [[martial arts]] to dispatch several would-be muggers much larger than she is.

Jennifer Walters is a skilled pilot, as has been shown in multiple issues of ''Avengers'' and ''Fantastic Four''.

Extremely intelligent, She-Hulk is a skilled and experienced attorney. In spite of the character's party-girl image, she is a bona fide intellectual, being one of the few superheroines to have attained an advanced post-baccalaureate degree.  Jennifer attended [[UCLA School of Law]], where she was a member of the Order of the Coif, a national merit society for top legal scholars.  It is revealed in the ''Savage She-Hulk'' that Walters has also attended Harvard Law School; though details are not provided, it is probable that she earned a master of laws (LL.M.) degree at Harvard to complement her juris doctor (J.D.) degree from UCLA.  She has shown great versatility in her legal practice, representing criminal defendants, corporations, and even [[domestic violence]] victims.  

She-Hulk is not above using her looks and sex appeal to her tactical advantage in a fight; she did so against a then-single Hawkeye during a conflict in their early appearances together in ''Avengers''.  It is revealed in ''The She-Hulk'' #100 that she once distracted and destroyed a cadre of alien villains by staging a [[wardrobe malfunction]].  In that issue, court testimony also reveals that her bosom is the largest of any heroine in the Marvel Universe.

In addition to her considerable strengths, She-Hulk does have a habit of appearing late for appointments &mdash; such as on the splash page of ''Avengers Unplugged'' #4 (April 1996). Due to lateness she missed the opportunity to appear on the David Letterman talk show with the other Avengers (''Avengers'' #239).

==Breaking the fourth wall==
[[image:ssh31.png|right|150px|thumb|Cover to ''Sensational She-Hulk'' #31, showing She-Hulk interacting with writer/artist John Byrne and editor Renée Witterstaetter.]]

She-Hulk apparently possesses a form of "cross-dimensional" or [[metafiction]]al awareness, as she is capable of breaking through the so-called [[fourth wall]]. In some stories she has revealed an awareness that she is a comic book character, which has allowed her to tear through the page or run over a page of advertisements in order to reach an enemy's control center.  On several occasions when the comic's writer ([[John Byrne]]) appeared to be out of control, she engaged in arguments with him, or appealed directly to the comic's editor, Renée Witterstaetter.

In the latest She-Hulk series written by [[Dan Slott]], Marvel Comics actually exist as licensed publications chronicling the adventures of the world's superheroes; they bear the seal of the [[Comics Code Authority]] of America, which is deemed to be a federal agency in the Marvel Universe.  Comics bearing the seal are considered legal documents, which lawyers in the books are able to cite as evidence in legal cases.  (This applies only to comics published until 2001; after that year Marvel established its own [[Marvel Rating System|in-house rating system]] &mdash; a fact noted in Slott's stories.) 

In She-Hulk's world comic readers inhabit the same universe as do the characters in the book. For example, while doing research for a case against the [[Roxxon]] corporation, Jennifer Walters recently discovered her origin issue, ''The Savage She-Hulk'' #1.  When the building housing her law office was destroyed and Jennifer needed information on [[Infinity Gems]], she was able to get the information she needed at a local comic book store.  

Several characters are aware that their likenesses appear in comic books, particularly members of teams such as the Fantastic Four and the Avengers &mdash;  both of which have included She-Hulk as a member.  Those teams actually sanction the publications about them.  As another example, [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] (Captain America) was once the writer and artist of his own comic book.  Other Marvel characters aware that they are characters in comic books include She-Hulk's friend Louise Mason (the [[Blonde Phantom]]); [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], (on occasion); [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]; [[Squirrel Girl]]; [[Howard The Duck]]; and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]].

John Byrne makes a brief cameo appearance in the main story of issue #3, volume 2 (issue #100 following the series' original numbering), complaining about the title's continuity problems. The issue features a coda in which one of the characters asks Jennifer if she really can interact with the readers. She coyly replies "No," while her face and eyes are drawn in such a way as to convey an awareness of the reader.

==Relationships==
She-Hulk's relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance. These needs were evident in her often tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters. A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental. In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.

Sheriff Walters felt that the best way for Jennifer to live was for her to follow his values. However, Jennifer grew up perceiving the gray areas of law enforcement.  (For example, she interpreted the events leading up to riots which occurred during her childhood differently from her father.)  Although Jennifer saw her decision to become a criminal defense attorney as a kind of homage to her father, Sheriff Walters instead interpreted her choice (to defend criminals) as a rejection of his values.

Jennifer worked at nurturing a supportive relationship with her father, and remained close to a childhood friend, Zapper, with whom she ultimately became romantically involved.  Being She-Hulk allowed Jennifer to express emotions which she was not otherwise comfortable revealing.  For example, although Jennifer Walters was restrained from dating a younger man, as the She-Hulk she felt free to express her affection for Zapper.  During that same time, Jennifer pursued a problematic relationship with the affable ne'er-do-well [[Richard Rory]] ([[Man-Thing]]), who actually valued her for who she really was.

Ultimately, She-Hulk's relationship with Zapper fell apart, primarily due to her insistence on permanently remaining in her She-Hulk form, eschewing the Jennifer Walters persona that Zapper had grown up with.  Zapper believed that Jennifer's preference represented a rejection of the character's true self. Although in actuality She-Hulk liberated much of Jennifer Walters' repressed personality, the She-Hulk persona also repressed certain aspects of Jennifer Walters' personality which She-Hulk found distasteful. 

During her time as an Avenger, She-Hulk engaged in a relationship with  [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] (''Avengers'' #234, August 1983). However, this encounter was later retold in flashback (''She-Hulk'' volume 2 #7 [June 2006)]), and in that storyline, Starfox was on trial, charged with sexually assaulting a married woman.  The alleged victim testified that Starfox's euphoria power had forced her to be sexually forward &mdash; as forward as She-Hulk herself had been during her own encounter with Starfox.  Upon hearing this testimony Jennifer concluded that her interaction with Starfox had not been consensual.  The extent to which Starfox mis-used his power to facilitate his relationship with Jennifer has been left unresolved. 

She-Hulk was briefly engaged to the younger [[Wyatt Wingfoot]], whom she first met during her tenure with the Fantastic Four (''Fantastic Four'' #269 [August 1984]).  She let her guard down with Wyatt, expressing her vulnerabilities as Wyatt supported her during a series of traumatic events.   (A paparazzi took photos of her sunbathing topless in ''Fantastic Four'' 275, and some agents of S.H.I.E.L.D sexually harassed her in ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18.)  Although She-Hulk put forward a brave exterior during those incidents, she appreciated Wyatt's support.

Although She-Hulk deeply values close emotional ties with family, friends and lovers, she seldom admits the depth of her need for these attachments. For example, years after her mother died, Jennifer could not move on from the family home. Even when her father moved out, Jennifer would not leave her family memories behind. The Avengers and Fantastic Four became surrogate families for her; she forged strong bonds with them. 

She-Hulk also had a one-night stand with the unstoppable [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], Cain Marko, in Uncanny X-Men #435 which got everyone on the internet in an uproar. The She-Hulk has been seen in other issues together with the Juggernaut but only as a lawyer.

She-Hulk is presently married to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], whom she first met while he was the Man-Wolf in a Microverse adventure in ''Savage She-Hulk''.  (The two precipitously eloped in Las Vegas [''She Hulk'' #9].)  However, the two share an apartment with She-Hulk's colleague, Augustus "Pug" Pugliese, who holds an unspoken (but obvious) crush on her. Pug correctly deduced that the suddeness of She-Hulk's strengthened feelings for Jameson, and the pair's marriage, were the result of manipulation by Starfox. Due to his efforts to prove this, She-Hulk and John became aware of Pug's crush just as John was forced to become the Man-Wolf once more. 

In the past John has stated a preference for She-Hulk in her human form and this may drive a wedge in their marriage.  In addition, She-Hulk's initial reaction to John's Man-Wolf/Stargod form has not been positive.

==Personality and costumes==
Due to her affiliation with different [[supergroups]] over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous [[costumes]]. She-Hulk's [[personality]] has  also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious. 

Because of her various outfit changes, no single costume can be considered [[iconic]] (compared to, for example, [[Superman]]'s blue and red 'tights', or [[Spider-Man]]'s red and blue costume and [[mask]]).  However, She-Hulk is immediately recognizable due to her size, her green skin and her long green hair.

In her first appearance, She-Hulk was a massive, towering [[amazons|amazon]], with wild, untamed, nearly waist-length [[hair]].  She wore a ragged white dress (the dress ripping and tearing as Walters turned into her giant [[alter-ego]]), and always went [[barefoot]]. By some miracle, that white garment, which was often only the blouse that Walters had on before her transformation, always hid  her unmentionables, in the same way that enough of the Incredible Hulk's pants always survived to hide his privates after his transformations.  When she was asked about this in an early issue of the second series, in response she simply revealed that her clothes carry the label of the Comics Code. 

During one of her 'savage' appearances, She-Hulk visited a high-priced dress shop and shredded a small outfit to make it fit her large frame: she was credited with starting the "ripped look," in which fashionistas sported strategically torn shirts, jackets and jeans.

After her 'Savage era', She-Hulk joined the Avengers and began dressing in a one-piece [[aerobics]] outfit, complemented with leg warmers and [[sneakers]]. During the Avengers era she wore a purple, one-piece [[bathing suit]], with a white belt and black boots. 

After the first of the Secret Wars, She-Hulk took the place of The Thing and became a full-fledged member of the [[Fantastic Four]].  Her costume kept the sleeveless/legless bathing suit design, incorporating the colors and style of the FF costumes, with white gloves and boots. After leaving the Fantastic Four, she rejoined the Avengers, donning a white one-piece costume with the blue Avengers [[insignia]] emblazoned on it.

More recently, She-Hulk has worn a purple and white one-piece outfit similar to a swimsuit, complemented by fingerless gloves and boots or athletic shoes. Her hair is long and straight, as opposed to the thick, curly tresses she sported in the past.

Her personality has also changed over the years: originally ill-tempered and violent, she's now a fun-loving, gentle woman who frequently deploys humor when fighting.  She even stated in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #27 that she prefers not to kill her foes, especially ones that she has already subdued.

==Appearances in other media==
===Animated series adaptations===
She-Hulk first appearance on television was in the 1982 animated ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' series broadcast on [[NBC]], where she was voiced by [[Victoria Carroll]].  This occurred in the eleventh episode entitled, "Enter: She-Hulk."  This episode briefly dealt with She-Hulk's origin (an emergency blood transfusion), while had Bruce Banner seeking She-Hulk's help in retaining his mind when he transforms into the Hulk. Matching the comic styling of the character at time, this She-Hulk was based on the Savage era.

She-Hulk appeared in the 1996 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series. She was voiced by [[Lisa Zane]] in season one and [[Cree Summer]] in season two. The series followed the comic book origins, having Jennifer Walters be Bruce Banner's cousin who receives a blood transfusion in a life and death situation, triggering a virtual one way transformation into a Sensational style She-Hulk who pretty much becomes the Hulk's constant companion. She only appeared in two episodes in season one, but practically pushed Hulk aside for center stage in season two, going from a fun and interesting character to an over the top yet comical [[femme fatale]] in season two.

She-Hulk will appear in an episode of Cartoon Network's [[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)|new ''Fantastic Four'' series]].[http://marvel.toonzone.net/fantasticfour/guides/]

===Live-Action adaptation===
[[Image:LiveSheHulk.jpg|thumb|right|Actress [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as She-Hulk.<br>Property of Marvel Comics.]]
A [[live-action]] motion picture was planned in the late 1980s with Carl Gottlieb as writer and production by Tamara Asseyez. Marvel Comics had been interested in producing the film for several years due to the prior success of the [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|Hulk television series]]. At the time Marvel Comics did not yet have the self-sustaining finances they have today to generate big budget films for their characters. Thus, they often sought out outside financial backers for various projects. The now bankrupt [[New World Communications|New World Pictures]] was one of the main studios used. Knowing that female characters were a harder sell on the big screen, Marvel Comics hired statuesque actress [[Brigitte Nielsen]] to pose for photos dressed in She-Hulk garb in order to give potential investors a visual idea of what can be done with the character. Brigitte had previously filmed a movie for Marvel Comics in 1985 (''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'') and they felt she was the best candidate for the role. Not finding success with U.S. investors, Marvel took the photos to pitch the idea overseas to find little interest there as well. Alas the only real interest found were in comic book readers who discovered the photos printed in various magazines at the time.

===Other live action appearances===
The British comedy ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' once featured a character similar to She-Hulk in a brief sketch. A young woman sexually harassed at a bus stop gets angrier and angrier until she transforms into a savage creature that exacts revenge on her harassers.

Actress [[Jenny McCarthy]] provided a similar skit for her cancelled television series ''The Jenny McCarthy Show'', in which she increasingly becomes angry in a restaurant until she becomes a blonde She-Hulk.

===Video Game appearances===
To date, She-Hulk's only playable appearance was in the [[1997]] [[Fantastic Four (PlayStation game)|Fantastic Four Playstation game]], a [[side-scrolling]] [[Beat 'em up]] that featured her along with the rest of the [[Fantastic Four]], a nod to her time with the group.

Evil clones of She-Hulk appeared  as enemies in [[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems]].</p>

She-Hulk appeared as a non-playable character in [[Capcom]]'s [[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]] (Arcade, Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation). She-Hulk can be seen in the background of the final level, having been turned to stone along with other heroes. In the ending video (after defeating Thanos) she and the others are shown returning to normal.

==Merchandise==
There have been numerous She-Hulk toys over the years, most frequently appearing in lines covering large numbers of Marvel characters such as [[Heroclix]] with other "minor" characters. Due to the previous perception of the She-Hulk as only a second tier group character, many of these actions figures were just [[Redeco]]'s of existing female figures that only broadly resembled the character. Her appearance in the 90's Incredible Hulk animated series and the revival of the character thanks to the recent solo series has finally lead to more care being given.

The first unique She-Hulk action figure was released among the later waves of toys produced for the ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series. This figure was later released as an exclusive toy for the [[magazine]] [[ToyFare]] with a [[Redeco]] to give it [[Fantastic Four]] costume.

The [[magazine]] [[ToyFare]] and Diamond Select Toys held a poll to decide to upon an exclusive [[Marvel Select]] figure for the Wizard World 2005 conventions, She-Hulk the clear winner of the five options. The figure was based upon the cover for She-Hulk #2 (2004 series), replacing the car with a dune buggy roughly similar to what Zapper drove, three pillars of dust assisting the illusion of the figure lifting the vehicle. Formerly sold only to atendees of the conventions, six per customer, the figure was eventually offered for sale to specialty retailers.

After a long wait and frequent fan requests, a [[Marvel Legends]] She-Hulk figure is finally slated for release in Wave 2 of the line under [[Hasbro]].
