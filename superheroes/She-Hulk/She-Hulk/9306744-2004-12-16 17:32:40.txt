'''She-Hulk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She first appeared in ''Savage She-Hulk'' #1.

The She-Hulk was created when Dr. Bruce Banner ([[the Incredible Hulk]]) gave his seriously injured cousin, Jennifer Walters, an emergency blood transfusion.  Due to this transfusion, Jennifer Walters became the She-Hulk.  She was initially a savage creature not unlike her cousin, although instead of transforming into a monster she became a tall, [[green]]-[[skin]]ned woman of [[Amazon]]ian stature.  She later came to relish the freedom that her new form gave her, and her savage persona became a more confident and extroverted version of her normal personality, although she would revert to savagery on occasion in the years to come.  In her more confident persona, she became a member of [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] and later the [[Fantastic Four]].

==Superhuman powers==

The She-Hulk possesses vast superhuman strength derived from a body-wide mutagenic change triggered by a transfusion of the gamma-irradiated blood of the Hulk. Jennifer Walters's close genetic resemblance to her cousin, Bruce Banner, enabled her body to transform without the direct exposure to the gamma radiation that affected the Hulk's body, and to transform into a being similar to the Hulk. (Intense gamma radiation would either kill most other people or induce harmful mutations in them). Because the catalyst for her transformation was indirect, the She-Hulk's superhuman form is not nearly as powerful as the Hulk's. 

Originally, as with the Hulk, the She-Hulk could transform back and forth between her human and superhuman forms. As with the Hulk, an increase in the level of epinephrine (known as adrenaline) due to stress triggered a chemical/extra physical process that added, in some unknown way, in the She-Hulk's case 540 pounds of bone, marrow, and tissue to her body. The total transformation took from 15 seconds to as long as three minutes, determined by the degree of stimulation achieved by the initial surge of epinephrine. Shortly after the transformation, the amount of epinephrine declines to normal, reduced levels. The She-Hulk could trigger her transformations back and forth by an act of will far more easily than the Hulk could. However, due to the mutagenic effect of further exposure to intense radiation, the She-Hulk is now unable to change back to her ''normal'' human form. 

Unlike the Hulk, the She-Hulk retained and retains her normal intelligence and personality in her superhuman form. (However, her enjoyment in being the She-Hulk has caused Walters to become more uninhibited in her behavior in the time since she first became the She-Hulk). Because she retains her normal intelligence, the She-Hulk is incapable of the primal rages that trigger increased levels of strength and body efficiency in the Hulk. 

The She-Hulk's powerful leg muscles enable her to leap straight up to a height of 600 feet (180 m), or to jump a distance of 1000 feet (300 m)

The  She-Hulk's body possesses a high degree of imperviousness to injury, pain, and disease. The She-Hulk's skin is capable of withstanding extremes of temperature, from -190 to 3000 °F (-120 to 1,600 °C), and great stresses and impacts without puncture wounds or lacerations (she can withstand direct hits by field-artillery cannon shells). The She-Hulk's highly efficient physiology renders her immune to all terrestrial diseases. 

The She-Hulk's mind has been altered by a member of the Ovoid alien race to permit her to exchange her physical characteristics and powers with the physical characteristics and powers of another being by simply focusing on a  mental image of the person and willing the transfer to take place. Presumably, the She-Hulk could gain different superhuman abilities if she exchanged forms with another superhuman being. To date, the maximum effective range of this ability remains unknown.  It should be noted that she rarely uses this power. 

==Special skills==

The She-Hulk is a good hand to hand combatant, having been trained by Captain America in the past.  She is also an extremely intelligent and highly skilled attorney. She apparently also has some form of "cross-dimensional" awareness, as some stories have revealed that she knows that she is a comic book character, a situation virtually unique among mainstream Marvel superheroes.
