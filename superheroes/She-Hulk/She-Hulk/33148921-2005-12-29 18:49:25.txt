'''She-Hulk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superheroine]] in [[Marvel Comics]].  She first appeared in ''Savage She-Hulk'' #1 (February [[1980]]).

==Publication history==
She-Hulk was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]] in ''Savage She-Hulk'' #1. This series lasted until 1982 where it ended with #25. Afterwards she appeared in ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18 in November, 1985. She regained a solo series in 1989, ''The Sensational She-Hulk''. In 1990 she appeared in the 2-issue ''She-Hulk: Ceremony''. ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' lasted until #60 in February 1994, making it the longest-running She-Hulk series so far. Her next appearence was not to be until May 2002, with the ''Thing and She-Hulk: The Long Night'' one-shot. She regained her own book, ''She-Hulk'', two years later. Despite favorable critical notices, the new series was not a commercial success. Marvel cancelled the book with issue #12 in April 2005 and announced plans to relaunch it Oct. 2005 with a new #1 issue. It will retain writer [[Dan Slott]] and the legal setting. Marvel further noted that the new series' third issue will be billed as the 100th solo She-Hulk story.

==Biography==

Jennifer Walters, the meek and mousy lawyer [[cousin]] of Bruce Banner ([[The Incredible Hulk]]), was the daughter of Sheriff Morris Walters.  Agents of Nicholas Trask, a crime boss who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on a day when her cousin was in town.  Bruce gave her a [[blood transfusion]], as no other donors of her [[blood type]] were available; the [[radioactive]] [[blood]] [[mutate]]d Jennifer as it had her cousin, transforming her into the [[green]]-[[skin]]ned She-Hulk.  As the She-Hulk, she possessed powers similar to her cousin, though at a reduced level and with a less monstrous, more [[Amazons|Amazonian]] appearance.  Jennifer's early adventures were chronicled in the [[1980]] [[Marvel Comics]] series ''The Savage She-Hulk'', written by [[David A. Kraft]].

Although she was at first savage while in her form as She-Hulk, she quickly came to appreciate the confidence and assertiveness that had come with it.  She now feels more comfortable in her form as She-Hulk than in her "normal" form as Jennifer.  After a brief solo career, she joined [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] and later replaced the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in the [[Fantastic Four]].

She later joined the staff of [[district attorney (county)|District Attorney]] Blake Tower, where she met Louise "Weezi" Mason, formerly the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroine called the [[Blonde Phantom]]; during this period, she discovered that Mason had manipulated Towers into hiring She-Hulk so that Mason could again star in a [[comic book]] and thus avoid dying of old age. Mason's husband, also a former comic book character, had passed away three years ago, but other, more popular characters from the era, such as [[Captain America]] and [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], were still around and full of youthful vigor.

While preventing a radiation leak in a downed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Helicarrier, Jennifer was apparently mutated to the point that she could not transform back into her original form, an agreeable turn of events for her since she preferred her She-Hulk form anyway, although it was recently revealed that the "genetic block" was in fact purely psychological, shortly before a similar block locked her in '''non'''-Hulk form. It is expected that this should be temporary.

She currently works as a lawyer for the Superhuman Law division of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg, & Holliway.

==Powers and abilities==

In her She-Hulk form, Jennifer possesses vast superhuman strength. On first becoming She-Hulk, she had the ability to lift 50 tons. Since then, she has increased her strength-level through training to the point where she can lift over 100 tons, she is now thought to be nearly as strong as her cousin, The Incredible Hulk. When she transforms back and forth, she gains/loses considerable mass (much of it muscle) by an unknown means.

In addition, thanks to training by the [[Ovoid (comics)|Ovoid]] alien race, She-Hulk can exchange her physical characteristics and powers with the physical characteristics and powers of another being by simply focusing on a mental image of the person and willing the transfer to take place. It should be noted that she rarely uses this power.

She has also discovered that as She-Hulk, she is exponentially stronger than her Jennifer Walters form.  This means that any extra strength gained as Jennifer Walters through intense physical training will be amplified, making her She-Hulk form that much stronger. This has been shown recently, when she single handidly lifted the Thing's heaviest training weight (somewhwere in the region of 100 tons) and successfully arm wrestled the Demi God Hercules. It should also be noted that Hercules still does not have his full "godly" powers since it was removed by his father Zeus of Olympus.  She used this to her advantage when she fought the [[Champion of the Universe]] on an alien world where court cases are decided in boxing arenas.

===Skills===

The She-Hulk is a good hand to hand combatant, having been trained by [[Captain America]] and [[Gamora]] in the past.  She is also an extremely intelligent and highly skilled attorney.

===Breaking the [[fourth wall]]===

[[image:ssh31.png|right|150px|thumb|Cover to '''Sensational She-Hulk #31''', showing She-Hulk interacting with writer/artist John Byrne and editor Renée Witterstaetter.]]

One interesting quirk is that she apparently also has some form of "cross-dimensional" awareness, as Jennifer is capable of breaking through the so-called [[fourth wall]]. Some stories have revealed that she knows that she is a comic book character, a situation virtually unique among mainstream Marvel superheroes, and has allowed her to perform such oddities as tearing through the page and running over a page of advertisements in order to reach the otherwise inaccessible control center of an enemy. On numerous instances, she even ended up arguing with the author of her comic, [[John Byrne]], or appealed to the comic's editor at the time, [[Renée Witterstaetter]], when Byrne appeared to be out of control.

It's worth noting that this awareness is dependent on circumstances beyond the fictional events in the [[Marvel Universe]], and comes and goes on the whim of writers and editors. As a rule of thumb, it can be assumed that in any story that does not specifically mention or feature said ability, she is not aware of being a comic book character.  Other characters write her off as delusional on this point.

More recently, in the 2004 ''She-Hulk'' series written by [[Dan Slott]], where she is a lawyer specializing in superhuman law, actual Marvel comic books are considered legal documents, which the characters cite for legal cases. In one issue, while doing research for a case against the [[Roxxon]] corporation, she discovers her origin issue, ''Savage She-Hulk'' #1. This conceit also proved handy when the law office was destroyed and she needed to find information on [[Infinity Gems]] — so she went into a comic-book store.

==Appearences in other media==

She-hulk appeared in The Incredible Hulk animated series. She was voiced by [[Lisa Zane]] in season one and [[Cree Summer]] in season two.
