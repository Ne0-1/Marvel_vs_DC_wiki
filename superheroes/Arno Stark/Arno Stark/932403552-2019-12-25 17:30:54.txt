An alternate equivalent of Arno Stark has since been seen in the mainstream [[Earth-616]] continuity as the previously unknown brother of [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark). He is revealed to have been genetically altered by the [[Recorder (comics)|Recorder]] known as 451, intending for the child to grow up to pilot a suit of armor known as the Godkiller. Upon learning this, [[Howard Stark]] sabotaged the experiment which rendered Arno crippled and unable to speak without the use of machines.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 5 #9â€“12</ref> His existence was purposefully kept a mystery until decades later when he was discovered by Tony at the [[Maria Stark]] Foundation.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #17</ref> He and Tony began transforming the decrepit Mandarin City into a futuristic utopia called Troy.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> Tony and Arno's plan soon found opposition in the form of the Rings of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] who started searching for hosts to destroy Tony and Troy.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #20</ref> The Mandarin-One named Lord Remaker bombed the Troy Central Control and Arno was seemingly killed.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #21</ref> However, Arno had deployed his [[Iron Man's armor|own suit]] of Iron Man's armor with which he later helped Iron Man and the Trojan Guard fight the enemy forces.

==Powers and abilities==
Iron Man 2020 wears a suit of highly sophisticated [[armor]], similar in appearance to the classic Iron Man armor (circa Model 5), with the exception of the faceplate and shoulders. Beam weapons are fitted in the gauntlets of the suit, as well as the chest beam and shoulder epaulets. The user no longer requires a [[cybernetic]] link in the helmet to control the armor; the helmet can also be hidden via cloaking technology, which was presumably developed based on the Chameleon mode of the Silver Centurion armor. Iron Man 2020's systems are built for [[warfare]], not super heroics like the original Iron Man. Iron Man 2020's repulsors (and an arsenal of other weapons) always fire at maximum power for the most lethal effects.  Curiously, Iron Man 2020 also has the original Iron Man's 1970s-era rollerskates (updated to a "roller blade" style{{issue|date=April 2013}}) built into the boots of the suit.
