'''Postman (David)''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character. He has the ability to permanently erase people's memories, usually specified by naming whatever he wants that person to forget.

==Fictional character biography==
Living life aboveground, the bespectacled David had everything society expected of him: a good job working at the post office and a wonderful wife, Erica. But all expectations evaporated the moment his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers activated and he found he had accidentally erased his wife's mind. Panicked, Postman sought refuge with the [[Morlocks (comics)|Chicago-area Morlocks]], whom he quickly became the leader to. As a group, the Morlocks decided that each of them should get a "last wish" before they disappear into the tunnels forever, and that the rest of the team would help each member achieve their wish.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

While robbing a [[convenience store]] for food, the group happened to stumble upon an injured young mutant named [[Cell (comics)|Cell]] who had just realized his mutation. The Morlocks fought off the policemen and offered Cell a place with them, which he accepted. The group then started fulfilling wishes and first on the list was [[Shatter (comics)|Shatter]], who wanted to liberate his best friend. Postman accompanied the Morlocks as they rescued Shatter's dog, Hank, from the pound, then followed as they went to make [[Electric Eve]]'s "wish" come true, unaware that wish was murder. They arrived to find Electric Eve having fried her ex-[[pimp]]. Postman and Eve argued about what she had done—making the rest of the Morlocks an accessory to murder. Eve retorted that Postman had put no limitations on what the wishes should be, Trader confessing that he wished to murder his co-worker who had "outed" him as a mutant and got him fired. However the argument was short-lived as the Sentinels arrived, blasting Shatter's arm off.{{issue|date=January 2013}}
 
The Morlocks fled back to their [[subway station]] home, and Postman helped [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]] care for the wounded Shatter. As Postman and Eve began to argue again, the police arrived, killing [[Trader (comics)|Trader]] as he tried to protect Electric Eve. As the others fought, Angel Dust tried to shield Shatter, trying to protect him, and begged the police not to hurt him (but they apparently had worse plans for her). Thankfully, Electric Eve leapt to her defense and fried the cops. Enraged at the destruction around him and the injury of his loved ones, Postman erased everything in the surviving police officer's minds, leaving them complete vegetables.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

They then left to make Postman's wish come true. Angel and [[Litterbug (comics)|Litterbug]] tore down a steel [[hospital]] door so that he could see his wife one last time. To make penance for Erica's accident, Postman penned a farewell note to her, which he placed on her bedside stand—unable to do anything for his [[coma]]tose wife. Postman then led them to the sewer junction beneath Washington and Chestnut, where Angel's parents lived, remarking that it was on his route. Angel was afraid to face them, fearing rejection, but Shatter explained that they all deserved closure. Angel went to her home and found her worried parents surrounded by missing posters. She explained that she was a mutant, and ran away to protect them. She didn't get to enjoy her reunion, as once more she had to flee as the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] homed in on her position. Eve comforted her as she cried, wishing there was some way that they could live free of the Sentinels. Litterbug explained that there was a way to disable the Sentinel Central Control. He then admitted he had helped design them.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Enraged, Angel Dust attacked Litterbug, pounding him down until Shatter convinced her to stop, that they all needed to work together. The Morlocks lured out and captured a Sentinel. Angel ripped it open, and then reprogrammed it following instructions from Litterbug. They sent a false message to Sentinel [[Headquarters|HQ]] stating that they'd been killed, and then used the giant robot as a [[Trojan Horse]] to get inside the control center. After the Morlocks ripped their way out, Angel tried to reprogram the computers, but had to save Cell from a [[guided missile]]. Electric Eve and Litterbug destroyed the main computer, sending the Sentinels out of control, and they Morlocks fled, but Cell ran back in, determined not to let the Project Director, Dr. Metellus, have another chance to harm his friends. Angel tried to convince him to run, but Cell was killed along with the doctor. As the others [[hot-wire]]d a stolen van, Angel decided to stay, like Cell, she was tired of running, and just wanted to go home to her parents. As the others left, Shatter asked Postman what would happen to Angel when the Sentinels got back on line. No one answered.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

In the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]—an event in which a [[mentally ill]] [[Scarlet Witch]] depowered over 90% of the mutant population—Postman was one of the many who lost his powers.<ref>revealed in ''New Avengers #18''</ref>
