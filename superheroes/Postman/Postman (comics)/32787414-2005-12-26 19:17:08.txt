Living life aboveground, the bespectacled David had everything society expected of him: a good gob working at the post office and a wonderful wife, Erica. But all expectations evaporated the moment his mutant powers activated and he found he had accidentally ereased his wife's mind. Panicked, Postman sought refuge with the Chicago-area Morlocks. To make penance for Erica's accident, Postman penned a farewell note to her. With the help of the Morlocks, Postman delivered his heart felt letter to his comatose wife in her hospital room but could do nothing to save her from her vegetative state.
