'''Philip Benjamin "Phil" Urich''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who once wore the infamous [[Green Goblin]] identity, but as a [[superhero]] instead of a [[supervillain]]. His first appearance was in ''Web of Spiderman'' #125.

==Biography==
Phil Urich, nephew of [[Ben Urich]] of the [[Daily Bugle]], tried to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]] following the death of [[Harry Osborn]], son of the original Green Goblin. However he was sometimes seen as being as maniacal as his villainous predecessors.  When his equipment is damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crossover, Phil is unable to repair or replace it and the fourth Green Goblin thereafter retires.  He later forms the support group called [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]], in order to prevent teenagers from becoming supeheroes and aiding young former ones.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] timeline, Phil Urich marries his girlfriend Meredith and becomes a [[Forensics|forensic scientist]] and friends with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].  He is aware of both Peter and [[Spider-Girl]]'s identities.  Phil Urich resumes the Goblin identity, first under the name of the Golden Goblin, then as the Green Goblin with the assistance of Normie Osborn (III).  After Phil lost a long series of battles, Normie recreates Phil's original mask, which grants him superhuman strength and other abilities, greatly enhancing his effectiveness.  He is also a founding member of the New [[New Warriors]].<!--not a redundant "new"! --><ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/mc2/greengoblin5.html Green Goblin VI]</ref>
