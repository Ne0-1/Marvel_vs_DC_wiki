'''Philip Benjamin "Phil" Urich''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who once wore the infamous [[Green Goblin]] identity, but as a [[superhero]] instead of a [[supervillain]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #125. Recently, he has become the latest individual to assume the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] identity, and he now operates as a supervillain.

==Fictional character biography==
Phil Urich, nephew of [[Ben Urich]] of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', stumbled upon one of Norman Osborn's old Green Goblin hideouts. Ingesting the "Goblin formula", he gained enhanced strength and endurance.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #1 (1995)</ref> He tried to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]] following the death of [[Harry Osborn]], son of the original Green Goblin. However he was sometimes seen as being as maniacal as his villainous predecessors. His equipment was damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crossover.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #12 (1995)</ref> Phil was unable to repair or replace it and retired as the fourth Green Goblin thereafter.<ref>''Green Goblin'' #13 (1995)</ref>

He later formed a [[Loners (comics)|superhero self-help group]] in order to prevent teenagers from becoming superheroes and aiding young former ones.<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #1-6</ref> After a mental meltdown, Phil attacked Mickey Musashi ([[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]]) and Chris Powell ([[Darkhawk]]), stealing the Darkhawk amulet and giving in to his psychosis. Afterwards, Phil was depowered, but escaped with [[Penance (X-Men)|Hollow]].<ref>''The Loners'' #5-6</ref>

He is next seen in New York helping out his uncle at the new [[Front Line (comics)|Front Line]] offices.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #648 (2010)</ref>  Gaining a crush on co-worker [[Norah Winters]], who is looking into "Goblin gangs" for a story, Phil goes to one of the old Goblin hideouts, hoping to find something there to impress her with. While there, he encounters Roderick Kingsley, the original [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], whom he kills. Phil then assumes the Hobgoblin identity for himself. Now operating as a supervillain, he attacks a local [[think tank]], and is confronted by [[Spider-Man]]. Catching the hero off-guard with his Goblin laugh, Phil tries to decapitate him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #649 (2010)</ref> One of the workers at the think tank is able to disrupt the sonics to save Spider-Man, but Phil is able to escape with the experimental metal he came to steal. He delivers the metal to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and becomes one of his operatives.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #650 (2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
===As Green Goblin===
Due to ingestion of a modified version of Norman Osborn's "Goblin Formula," Phil Urich gained superhuman strength (able to lift upwards of 9 tons), stamina, durability, speed and reflexes; however, he was unable to access these abilities without the unknown catalyst provided by the Goblin mask he wore. He also possessed a so-called "Lunatic Laugh" capable of creating sound waves disorienting to most people. It seems possible that the formula had also increased his intelligence since he had shown to have an unusual cleverness when it came to strategy and modifying his equipment, as the Goblin formula had done for other users such as [[Roderick Kingsley]] and [[Norman Osborn]]. Whether or not he needed the mask for this was unknown.

As the Green Goblin, Phil wore an alternate/spare Goblin costume composed of a chainmail mesh capable of deflecting small arms fire. He traveled on a bat-shaped, one-man, rocket-propelled "[[Green Goblin#Goblin Glider|Goblin Glider]]." Like other Goblins' gliders, it was armed with heat-seeking missiles, machine guns and retractible blades. Other weapons Phil typically used were incendiary Pumpkin Bombs capable of melting through {{convert|3|in|mm}} of steel, smoke and gas-emitting bombs with an appearance like a ghost, razor-edged bat-shaped boomerangs and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity capable of discharging nearly 1,000 volts of electricity. Most of this equipment was completely destroyed or rendered inoperable during Phil's final battle with the Sentinel.

===As Hobgoblin===
With his takeover as the Hobgoblin, Urich steals Osborn's new Green Goblin equipment from his secret lair, which Kingsley planned to take for himself, made up of similar weaponry. He also adds a large, flaming sword and a pair of mechanical wings to his repertoire, while changing the coloring to fit the Hobgoblin persona and taking Kingsley's mask as his own.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #684-650 (2010)</ref>

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] timeline, Phil Urich marries his girlfriend Meredith and becomes a [[Forensics|forensic scientist]] and friends with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. He is aware of both Peter and [[Spider-Girl]]'s identities. Phil Urich resumes the Goblin identity, first under the name of the Golden Goblin, then as the Green Goblin with the assistance of Normie Osborn III. After Phil lost a long series of battles, Normie recreates Phil's original mask, which grants him superhuman strength and other abilities, greatly enhancing his effectiveness. He is also a founding member of the New [[New Warriors]].<!--not a redundant "new"! --><ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/mc2/greengoblin5.html Green Goblin VI]</ref>

While Phil originally required the technology in the Goblin mask to enhance his physical abilities and no longer has access to it, he retained one power that he is able to activate without the mask. Phil is capable of using his laughter as a sonic weapon of sorts. His "lunatic laugh" has been shown to disorient opponents and even shatter their eardrums. He once used the laugh while out of costume to defeat the Venom symbiote after it had taken possession of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].{{Issue|date=December 2010}}
