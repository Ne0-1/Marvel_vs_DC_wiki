'''Philip Benjamin "Phil" Urich''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who once wore the infamous [[Green Goblin]] identity, but as a [[superhero]] instead of a [[supervillain]]. His first appearance was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #125.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Expand|date=March 2008}}
Phil Urich, nephew of [[Ben Urich]] of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', tried to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]] following the death of [[Harry Osborn]], son of the original Green Goblin. However he was sometimes seen as being as maniacal as his villainous predecessors.  When his equipment is damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crossover, Phil is unable to repair or replace it and the fourth Green Goblin thereafter retires.  He later forms a [[Loners (comics)|superhero self-help group]] in order to prevent teenagers from becoming superheroes and aiding young former ones.

After a mental meltdown, Phil attacked Mickey Musashi (Turbo) and Chris Powell (Darkhawk), stealing the Darkhawk amulet and giving in to his psychosis.  Afterwards, Phil is depowered, but escapes with Penance.  He has not been seen since.

==Powers and Abilities==
Due to ingestion of a modified version of Norman Osborn's "Goblin Forumula," Phil Urich gained superhuman strength (able to lift upwards of 9 tons), stamina, durability, speed and reflexes; however, he was unable to access these abilities without the unknown catalyst provided by the Goblin mask he wore. He also possessed a so-called "Lunatic Laugh" capable of creating sound waves disorienting to most people.

As the Green Goblin, Phil wore a alternate/spare Goblin costume composed of a chainmail mesh capable of deflecting small arms fire. He traveled on a bat-shaped one-man, rocket-propelled "[[Goblin Glider]]." Like other Goblins' gliders, it was armed with heat-seeking missiles, machine guns and retractible blades. Other weapons Phil typically used were incendiary Pumpkin Bombs capable of melting through 3 inches of steel, smoke and gas-emitting bombs with an appearance like a ghost, razor-edged bat-shaped boomerangs and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity capable of discharging nearly 1,000 volts of electricity. Most of this equipment was completely destroyed or rendered inoperable during Phil's final battle with the Sentinal.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] timeline, Phil Urich marries his girlfriend Meredith and becomes a [[Forensics|forensic scientist]] and friends with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].  He is aware of both Peter and [[Spider-Girl]]'s identities.  Phil Urich resumes the Goblin identity, first under the name of the Golden Goblin, then as the Green Goblin with the assistance of Normie Osborn III.  After Phil lost a long series of battles, Normie recreates Phil's original mask, which grants him superhuman strength and other abilities, greatly enhancing his effectiveness.  He is also a founding member of the New [[New Warriors]].<!--not a redundant "new"! --><ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/mc2/greengoblin5.html Green Goblin VI]</ref>

While Phil originally required the technology in the Goblin mask to enhance his physical abilities and no longer has access to it, he retained one power that he is able to activate without the mask. Phil is capable of using his laughter as a sonic weapon of sorts. His "lunatic laugh" has been shown to disorient opponents and even shatter their eardrums. He once used the laugh while out of costume to defeat the Venom symbiote after it had taken possession of [[Peter Benjamin Parker|Peter Parker]].
