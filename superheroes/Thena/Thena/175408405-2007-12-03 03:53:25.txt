'''Thena''' (born '''Azura''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She is a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Originally born under the name Azura, but her father [[Zuras]] had her name changed to resemble that of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' daughter [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] to seal the treaty between their two peoples.  Due to this, she has often been mistaken for Athena.  The city of [[Athens]] was apparently built for her, not the goddess, although Thena later allowed it to be conquered by the [[Sparta]]ns in 404 B.C.

Encountered [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] in [[Babylon]] 2,500 years ago. He had a chance to slay her, but did not; as the years passed, the two of them grew closer together.  Thena and Kro made love during the [[Vietnam War]], resulting in Thena becoming pregnant with twins.  She placed them inside of Ms. Ritter, an infertile woman, who raised them as her own twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter|Donald and Deborah]].

When Kro led his armies in an attack on [[New York]], Thena opposed him.  After Kro called a truce, he showed her [[Ransak the Reject]], a genetically stable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]]. Thena was convinced by the Deviant [[Karkas]] to grant both of them sanctuary.  After Zuras' death & the subsequent departure of most of Earth's Eternals, Thena became [[Prime Eternal]], but she was traumatized by her father's death & was being subtly influenced by a Brain-Mine Kro had placed upon her.  She turned against [[Ikaris]] to help save Kro's life, but later relinquished her title to Ikaris.  When she learned of the Brain-Mine, she was furious with Kro, but has since forgiven him.

=== The Eternals (2006) ===

In the 2006 Eternals title, Thena is married to Thomas Eliot, with a son, and is a researcher at [[Stark Enterprises]].  Like [[Sersi]] and [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], she was affected by [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite's]] reality warping to have no memory of her past as an Eternal. 

Recently, she was released from a hostage situation by [[Iron Man]] in relation to the recent [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] Comics Event.  Afterwards, she began to suffer terrible Nightmares in which she was indeed Immortal, and fought off various multicoloured Deviants with ease.  When she awoke from one of these dreams, she found she had gained back her costume and powers.  She is then enlisted by [[Ikaris]] to help stop 'The [[Dreaming Celestial]]' from awaking in his sleeping place beneath Los Angeles. 

By the end of the story, she remains one of the Eternals, keeping her child with her in their home after a heated argument with Zuras.

== Alternate versions ==

In [[A-Next|Avengers-Next]] issue #2, It is revealed that Thor had a daughter in the alternate timeline, who is also called [[Thena (MC2)|Thena]], and possesses her father's storm god powers.
