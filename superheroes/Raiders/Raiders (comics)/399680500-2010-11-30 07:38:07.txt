The '''Raiders''' are a team of three [[fictional characters]] that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Raiders first appear in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #145 (Apr. 1981) and was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Bob Layton]].

== Publication history ==
The Raiders first feature in the title ''[[Iron Man]]'',<ref>''Iron Man'' #145 (Apr. 1981)</ref> and suddenly appearing during a [[technology]] [[trade show]] and causing property damage until the arrival of the hero Iron Man. The trio skirmish with Iron Man for a moment, with one of the Raiders using [[acid]] to damage hero's armor. During a second battle at a live [[boxing match]], Iron Man defeats the all three Raiders. The trio are revealed to be the employees of [[Edwin Cord]], a [[corporate]] rival of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (Iron Man's alter ego). Cord knew that Iron Man, as Stark's [[bodyguard]], would follow him to the trade show, and used this opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the Raider suits for covert organisation [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The character, however, is [[arrested]] by S.H.I.E.L.D agents for his irresponsible actions.

The Raiders reappear, with upgraded suits, during the [[Armor Wars]] storyline in the title ''Iron Man''. Tony Stark discovers his armor designs have been stolen and decides to retrieve or neutralize the technology, leading to a brief confrontation with the Raiders, in which their suits are rendered [[defunct]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #225 (Jan. 1988)</ref>

The Raiders were later part of an army of armor-wearing mercenaries hired to attack Stark Enterprises. <ref>''Avengers West Coast'' annual #7 (1992)</ref>

The characters reappear in the second volume of ''The Invincible Iron Man'' and confront Iron Man once again.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' vol. 2, #3 (Sep. 2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Each of the Raider suits provide the wearer with greater durability and [[flight]], and offer varying weapons systems. "Raider 1" is equipped with wristbands that can generate [[bullet]]s; [[acid]] and [[laser]]s; "Raider 2" is equipped with a [[net (device)|net]] capable of [[syphon]]ing energy and a protective shield that absorbs energy attacks and "Raider 3" has two wrist weapons that project and amplify [[sonic wave]]s in concentrated form.
