She teamed up with [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] (secretly Spider-Man in disguise) in attempt at revenge before being hospitalised by [[Bloodscream]].

During her career, she had a role in the rebirth of two of Spider-Man's old foes during the Rose's efforts to gain extra muscle: she was the one who threw the switch of the [[electric chair]] which gave [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] his powers back, and helped set up the theft of [[Doctor Octopus]]' corpse for re-animation from [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]].
