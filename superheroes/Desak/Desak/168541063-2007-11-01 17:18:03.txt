'''Desak Sterixian''', more commonly known as '''Desak the God Slayer''', is a [[fictional character]] and a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. 

==Fictional character history==

Desak comes from an unnamed world where the inhabitants worship a god called Kronnitt. Kronnitt demands the sacrifice of Desak's daughter, and it was during the sacrifice that an apparition visits Desak and offers him a magic gem that will save his daughter. Desak thinks he is hallucinating, and refuses. When Kronnitt punishes Desak's people - despite the sacrifice - the apparition returns and this time Desak accepts the gem. The gem empowers Desak and enables him to detect gods and absorb and redirect energy attacks, in addition to making him near indestructible. This makes it seems like he is in fact immune to the powers of gods. Most importantly, once Desak kills a god he is able to - courtesy of the gem - absorb their power and become even stronger. Equipped with a huge sword, axe, dagger and shield, Desak then confronts and kills Kronnitt. His course of action clear, Desak travels from world to world and slays pantheon after pantheon of gods.

It is during this time that Desak encounters [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Beta Ray Bill]], and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], who try to defend a pair of gods called Pennsu and Tae that Desak is hunting. When Pennsu and Tae attempt to destroy their own people the heroes intervene, giving Desak time to slay them both. After a terse verbal encounter with Thor, Desak departs. <ref>''Thor'' Annual vol. 2, 2001</ref>

Desak then goes on to slay almost all the [[Dark Gods (comics)|Dark Gods]] - the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]]' old enemies - with the exception of [[Perrikus]] and Adva, who escape. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, 41</ref> Desak is then contacted by [[Zarrko|Zarrko the Tomorrow Man]], who warns him of the threat that Thor - now Lord of Asgard with the death of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] - poses to Earth. After easily dispatching the [[Grey Gargoyle]], who at the time had deluded notions of godhood, Desak fights and almost kills Thor. Having absorbed the Odinforce after a futile attack by Thor, Desak is about to decapitate Thor when a fellow Asgardian, Thialfi, provides Thor with the [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]], which Thor uses to kill Desak. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, 47 - 50</ref>

Unknown to Thor, the apparition rescues Desak and allows him to heal in hiding. Desak returns during the events of the Reigning, and kills many of Thor's closest Asgardian comrades. It is at this moment that the apparition is revealed to be [[Tarene]], the Designate, who had traveled back in time to try and stop The Reigning from ever occurring. Merging with the Destroyer, Desak becomes even more powerful, but now faces an enlightened Thor who realizes that his actions were wrong. Thor then hurls Mjolnir with such force that it completely decapitates the Destroyer, killing Desak instantly. Desak has not been seen since, even after Thor resets the timeline so that the Reigning never happened. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, 75 - 79</ref>
