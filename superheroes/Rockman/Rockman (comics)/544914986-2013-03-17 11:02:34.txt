==Fictional character biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
In his historical origin, Rockman was the leader of an underground race of beings who were the descendants of the first white colonists of North America.  Their kingdom was known as Abyssmia, and was located underneath the country.  Noticing the effects of [[World War II|war]] overhead, Rockman leaves Abyssmia to assist the United States in its war effort.  He is disturbed and unable to comprehend the fact that anyone would despoil the aboveground realms with warfare.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===The Twelve===
{{Main|The Twelve (comics)}}
Some time after his official introduction as a superhero, Rockman joins [[Captain America]], the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and a cadre of second-tier superheroes in the [[Battle of Berlin]].  There he is ambushed and captured along with [[Blue Blade]], [[Black Widow (Claire Voyant)|The Black Widow]] (unrelated to [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|the modern character]] of that name), [[Captain Wonder (Timely Comics)|Captain Wonder]], [[Dynamic Man (Timely Comics)|Dynamic Man]], [[Fiery Mask]], [[Laughing Mask]], the original [[Master Mind Excello]], [[Mister E (Timely Comics)|Mister E]], [[Phantom Reporter]], the [[Witness (comics)|Witness]] and the telepathically controlled robot [[Electro (comics)#Electro (Timely Comics)|Electro]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

As Electro is deactivated and unable to help the other heroes, they are doused with sleeping gas and placed in cryogenic stasis by [[Nazi]] scientists, who hope to dissect them and discover the secret of their superhuman abilities. Rockman, along with the others, is "lost" when the scientists are killed during the fall of Berlin.  Years later in 2008, the heroes are found.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

He and his teammates are brought to live in a luxurious mansion, while adjusting to modern life; a task in which he fails miserably.  Still pining for his lost kingdom, Rockman never moves from the basement, futilely slamming his hands on the ground in an attempt to contact any Abyssmians.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

It is strongly hinted that Rockman's historical origin has simply been a delusional fantasy when Danielle Rose, a young girl from West Virginia, tells the military caretakers of Rockman that the hero may be her lost great-uncle Daniel Rose.  Apparently, Rose was a miner who lived in Tarleton, West Virginia, and became well known for being the first miner to advocate unionizing. Rose lived there with his wife and daughter (whom he referred to as his "little princess"), until Boss Clete, the corrupt head of the Lufton Fuel Company, hired some thugs to silence the growing [[trade union]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Rose accepted the fight, and brought his trade union down into the mine to confront Clete's men. At the last moment, Boss Clete attempted to flee, while exploding behind himself a hidden [[dynamite]] charge that was intended to seal off the mine and kill Daniel Rose and his men.  However, Boss Clete forgot to take in account the eventual [[methane]] chain reactions.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

As a result, the mine collapsed around the men, killing everyone except for Rose.  Exposure to hidden pockets of an "unknown mutagenic gas" gave him extended reserves of strength and durability, along with making him impervious to harm. When Rose returned to the surface, after two days of constant digging, he discovered that the resulting sinkhole had swallowed the whole Tarleton, killing everyone he held dear, included his beloved wife and his "little princess".{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Daniel Rose snapped, and in his stupor was left pounding the ground, calling his lost family to him.  Exhausted and utterly unbalanced, Rose abandoned his town only to resurface later as "Rockman, King of Abyssmia", which may have been a psychological coping mechanism to deal with the shattered figments of his former life.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Danielle presents proof of her findings, and shows the caretakers a [[photograph]] of Daniel Rose.   However, they lie to Danielle and send her away, acknowledging that the hope of being reunited with his lost family is the only thing holding Rockman's remaining shreds of sanity together.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Besides having access to advanced Abyssmian technology, including a "digger car" for transport and advanced monitoring equipment, Rockman has the powers of superspeed, super toughness, super strength, and super hand-to-hand combat skills.  He does not need air and can withstand the extreme pressures of the bottom of the sea.

After his revival in ''The Twelve'' he has not demonstrated his super-speed powers, and his physical prowess, nigh-invulnerability and durability are explained as the exposure to a still unknown underground gas{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. As Rockman is revealed to be a citizen of the U.S.A. named Daniel Rose, his Abyssmian technology is now [[retcon]]ned, or explained as enhanced digging instruments, as Daniel Rose was a professional miner.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

His mental state, precarious after the tragic loss of his family, continues to erode as he is brought into modern times.  Rockman is in a state of constant mourning, waiting for his dead loved ones to return.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
