The [[comic book]] character '''Ace the Bat-Hound''' was the canine crime-fighting partner of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in [[DC Comics]] of the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]]. Ace debuted in ''Batman'' #92 (cover-dated June [[1955]]). Ace's creation was likely inspired by the success of [[Krypto]]'s debut in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #210 (March [[1955]]). He was created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Sheldon Moldoff]], who said the character was inspired by [[Rin Tin Tin]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ace was a [[German Shepherd Dog]] originally owned by an engraver named John Wilker. He was found by Batman and Robin after his master was kidnapped by a gang of counterfeiters. Batman used Ace to try to locate Wilker. Because he had already placed a large number of "lost dog" announcements for Ace in his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne, he was concerned that anyone recognizing Ace (who had a prominent star-shaped marking on his forehead) might make the connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. To forestall that problem, he hastily improvised a hood-like mask for the dog that incorporated the bat emblem as a [[dog tag]] dangling from Ace's collar. Ace was subsequently christened "The Bat-Hound" by a criminal he helped Batman to apprehend.

Wilker later took a new job that made it difficult for him to take care of Ace, so he left the dog to Bruce Wayne. Wilker was never aware that Ace was the Bat-Hound or that Bruce Wayne was Batman.

Ace disappeared from the ''Batman'' comics after [[Julius Schwartz]] took over as editor in [[1964]], and made only very occasional comic book appearances (such as in ''[[Ambush Bug]]'' #3, [[1984]], which looked at what were considered some of the sillier areas of the DC universe) in the years afterward. 

A modern-day version of Ace was reintroduced in ''Batman'' #462 ([[1991]]), although he has been little seen in recent years. This version originally belonged to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[shaman]] and had a distinctive bat-shaped patch on his shoulder. He didn't wear a mask, nor was he referred to as Bat-Hound.  The dog at times helped Batman on cases, but disappeared after the events of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline in the late [[1990s]].

==Other versions of Ace the Bat-Hound==
In [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]' [[Kingdom Come]] miniseries, Ace is portrayed as the giant winged steed of the [[Fourth World]] Batwoman.  Ace is also mentioned in [[Howard Chaykin]]'s  Batman/Houdini crossover.  During a seance attended by Bruce Wayne and mystic debunker [[Harry Houdini]], Ace was referred to as Bruce Wayne's childhood pet. In the [[Frankenstein]] pastiche ''Castle of the Bat'', Dr Bruce Wayne tests his theories by creating a literal Bat-Hound; a dog with some of the attributes of a bat.

Pre-Crisis, [[Superman]]'s Batman-like identity of [[Nightwing]] included a [[Kandor]]ian counterpart to the Bat-Hound, a telepathic dog named "Nighthound".

==Ace in other media==
===Batman Beyond===
In the late [[1990s]] [[animated series]] ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', an aged Bruce Wayne had a pet/guard dog named Ace, a [[Great Dane]], but there were no indications that he'd ever used that incarnation of Ace as a crime-fighting assistant. However, one episode revealed Ace, as a puppy, was bought from a pet store by Mr. Boxer, the leader of an illegal dog-fighting ring. Ace escaped this abusive, violent life. He soon found Bruce, a fellow tormented soul, and the two got along well. Ace did not like young [[Terry McGinnis]], Wayne's assistant and protegee, at first. After he and Terry were able to help eachother on several missions, including stopping Mr. Boxer's attempt to use synthetic growth hormones to turn his dogs into monsters, Terry earned Ace's affection, a fact that, in Terry's opinion, was one of the small rewards being Batman had brought him.

Ace then went on to play a role in defeating the Joker in [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]] in the climax of the movie, attacking the Joker and damaging the controls for the Joker's new satellite weapon system.

It is vaguely suggested in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode, ''[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]'' that Bruce may have named the dog after the original [[Ace (comics)|Ace]] (whom he was close to, and who died in his arms) of the [[Royal Flush Gang]].

===Krypto the Superdog===

In the [[2005]] [[Cartoon Network]] animated series ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'' (that stars [[Krypto]], [[Superman]]'s childhood dog), Ace makes occasional appearances and is once again a crimefighting ally of Batman, though the Dark Knight himself has not, to date, appeared on the show. In this series, Ace, much like Batman, is equipped with various gadgets and equipment as an aid in his crimefighting efforts. In one episode, he met the [[Dog Star Patrol]] and helped them find Hot Dog. His enemies include The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s hyenas Bud and Lou, The [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s trained birds (Artie the Puffin, Griff the Vulture, Waddles the Penguin), and [[Catwoman]]'s cat Isis.  Ace is voiced by [[Scott McNeil]].

----

In the new ''[[The Batman]]'' animated series [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] remarks, upon [[Batgirl]]'s introduction, "Should I have a doggie door installed in case Bathound would like to join the team?" A similar remark appears in ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]''.
