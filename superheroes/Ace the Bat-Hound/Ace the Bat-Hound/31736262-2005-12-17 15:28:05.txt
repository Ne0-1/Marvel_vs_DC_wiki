The [[comic book]] character '''Ace the Bat-Hound''' was the canine crime-fighting partner of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in [[DC Comics]] of the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]]. Ace debuted in ''Batman'' #92 (cover-dated [[June]] [[1955]]). Ace's creation was likely inspired by the success of [[Krypto]]'s debut in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #210 (March [[1955]]). He was created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Sheldon Moldoff]], who said the character was inspired by [[Rin Tin Tin]].

Ace was a [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd]] originally owned by an engraver named John Wilker. He was found by Batman and Robin after his master was kidnapped by a gang of counterfeiters. Batman used Ace to try to locate Wilker. Because he had already placed a large number of "lost dog" announcements for Ace in his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne, he was concerned that anyone recognizing Ace (who had a prominent star-shaped marking on his forehead) might make the connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. To forestall that problem, he hastily improvised a hood-like mask for the dog that incorporated the bat emblem as a [[dog tag]] dangling from Ace's collar. Ace was subsequently christened "The Bat-Hound" by a criminal he helped Batman to apprehend.

Wilker later took a new job that made it difficult for him to take care of Ace, so he left the dog to Bruce Wayne. Wilker was never aware that Ace was the Bat-Hound or that Bruce Wayne was Batman.

Ace disappeared from the ''Batman'' comics after [[Julius Schwartz]] took over as editor in [[1964]], and made only very occasional comic book appearances (such as in ''[[Ambush Bug]]'' #3, [[1984]], which looked at what were considered some of the sillier areas of the DC universe) in the years afterward. 

A modern-day version of Ace was reintroduced in ''Batman'' #462 ([[1991]]), although he has been little seen in recent years. This version originally belonged to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[shaman]] and had a distinctive bat-shaped patch on his shoulder. He didn't wear a mask, nor was he referred to as Bat-Hound.  The dog at times helped Batman on cases, but disappeared after the events of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline in the late [[1990s]].

===Batman Beyond===
In the late [[1990s]] [[animated series]] ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', an aged Bruce Wayne had a pet/guard dog named Ace, a [[Great Dane]], but there were no indications that he'd ever used that incarnation of Ace as a crime-fighting assistant. However, one episode revealed Ace, as a puppy, was bought from a pet store by a cruel man who forced dogs to fight one another gladiator style for the amusement of paying crowds. Ace escaped this abusive, violent life. He soon found Bruce, a fellow tormented soul, and the two got on well. Young [[Terry McGinnis]], Wayne's assistant and protegee, seemed to be the only other person Ace ever connected to.

It is vaguely suggested in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode, ''[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]'' that Bruce may have named the dog after Ace (whom he was close to, and who died in his arms) of the [[Royal Flush Gang]].

===Krypto the Superdog===

In the [[2005]] [[Cartoon Network]] animated series ''[[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]]'', Ace makes occasional appearances, and is once again a crimefighting ally of Batman. In this series, Ace is equipped with various gadgets and equipment as an aid in his crimefighting efforts. In one episode, he met the [[Dog Star Patrol]] and helped them find Hot Dog. His enemies include The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s hyenas Bud and Lou, The [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s trained birds (Artie the Puffin, Griff the Vulture, Waddles the Penguin), and [[Catwoman]]'s cat Isis.  Ace is voiced by [[Scott McNeil]].
