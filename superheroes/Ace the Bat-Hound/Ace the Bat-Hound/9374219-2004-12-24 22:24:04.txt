The [[comic book]] character '''Ace the Bat-Hound''' was the canine crime-fighting partner of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (Batman)|Robin]] in [[DC Comics]] of the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]]. Inspired by the success of [[Krypto]] in the ''[[Superman]]'' comics of the same period, Ace debuted in ''Batman'' #92 (cover-dated June [[1955]]). He was created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Sheldon Moldoff]], who said the character was inspired by [[Rin Tin Tin]].

Ace was a [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd]] originally owned by an engraver named '''John Wilker'''. He was found by Batman and Robin after his master was kidnapped by a gang of counterfeiters. Batman used Ace to try to locate Wilker. Because he had already placed a large number of "lost dog" announcements for Ace in his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne, he was concerned that anyone recognizing Ace (who had a prominent star-shaped marking on his forehead) might make the connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. To forestall that problem, he hastily improvised a hood-like mask for the dog that also incorporated the bat emblem as a dog tag depending from Ace's collar. Ace was subsequently christened "The Bat-hound" by a criminal he helped Batman to apprehend.

Wilker later took a new job that made it difficult for him to take care of Ace, so he left the dog to Bruce Wayne. Wilker was never aware that Ace was the Bat-Hound or that Bruce Wayne was Batman.

Ace disappeared from the ''Batman'' series after [[Julius Schwartz]] took over as editor in [[1964]], making only very occasional comic book appearances (e.g., ''Ambush Bug'' #3, 1984). 

A modern-day version of Ace was reintroduced in ''Batman'' #462 ([[1991]]), although he has been little seen in recent years.
In the [[animated series]] ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Bruce Wayne had a pet/guard dog named Ace, a [[Great Dane]], but there were no indications that he'd ever used that incarnation of Ace as a crime-fighting assistant.
