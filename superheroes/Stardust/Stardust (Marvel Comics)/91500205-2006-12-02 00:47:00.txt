'''Stardust''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics Universe]], and one of the many [[Herald of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]].

==History==

When it first revealed its existence, Stardust claimed that it existed as pure cosmic energy, making it hard to say whether Stardust is a "he" or "she". It also claims to have seen many worlds being created out of nothing. After his last Herald was taken away from him, [[Galactus]] found a new recruit in Stardust and gave it enhanced powers. The first planet Stardust fed to Galactus was New Korbin, after he slaughtered most of the planet's inhabitants. 

This led to the confrontation with [[Beta Ray Bill]], who was busy attempting to rescue the Korbinites. The two fought each other, and after the first confrontation, Stardust sought out Bill after he obtained the Meta-Orb. Planning on crushing Bill with it, the two fought each other until Stardust opened a portal to a dimension filled with the most evil beings of the [[universe]] hoping to trap Bill in there. Bill managed to escape, but a being named Asteroth escaped and began devouring universes. Stardust and Bill joined forces, with Stardust using his powers to open a [[black hole]] behind Asteroth hoping to lock her in it. However, Asteroth resisted and the hole instead sucked both Stardust and Bill to a near death. 

As the two recovered, Stardust had earlier found Galactus' former Herald, Alpha Ray. Galactus had empowered Ray once again to help Stardust take down his opponent. With the black hole still open, Ray managed to do this, but in return was together with Asteroth sucked into the hole, ending both of their lives.

==Annihilation wave==
In the Annhilation Silver Surfer mini Stardust is sent by Galactus to ask the Silver Surfer to meet with Galactus. Stardust meanwhile is under orders to help the other remaining heralds Red Shift and Firelord as they combat the Annhilation fleet. Later the three heralds join with Nova's United Front and defeat and capture one of Annhilus' queens. With the Silver Surfer and Galactus now captured and Firelord half-dead, Stardust and Red Shift are the only two active heralds.

As of Annihilation issue 3, Stardust and Redshift are both presumed dead after holding back a massive energy blast from Galactus absorbing device.

==Trivia==
*This Stardust has nothing to do with the former Marvel Character known as Stardust, a former enemy of [[Rom the Spaceknight]].
*When discussing the aftermath of the [[Annihilation_(comics)|Annihilation]] event, writer Keith Giffen announced a special oneshot starring two Heralds of Galactus, Firelord and 'the gay one'. Whe asked to clarify, he responded 'Stardust, I meant Stardust'.{{fact}}
