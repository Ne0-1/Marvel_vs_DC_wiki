'''Stardust''' ('''Lambda-Zero''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] and existing in that company's [[Marvel Universe]]. Stardust is one of the many [[Herald of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]]. Unlike most of Galactus's Heralds, Stardust seeks to kill all who attempt to escape the planets that Galactus feeds upon, an action that Galactus neither requires nor forbids.

This Stardust should not be confused with the other Marvel Character known as Stardust, a former enemy of [[Rom the Spaceknight]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Ethereal Lambda-Zero, who later became known as Stardust, the Herald of Galactus, was first introduced in the comics series ''[[Stormbreaker]]: The Saga of [[Beta Ray Bill]]''. The first planet Stardust fed to Galactus was New Korbin, after he slaughtered most of the planet's inhabitants.

This led to the confrontation with Beta Ray Bill, who was busy attempting to rescue the Korbinites. The two fought each other, and after the first confrontation, Stardust sought out Bill after he obtained the Meta-Orb. Planning on crushing Bill with it, the two fought each other until Stardust opened a portal to a dimension filled with the most evil beings of the [[universe]] hoping to trap Bill in there. Bill managed to escape, but a being named Asteroth escaped and began devouring galaxies. Stardust and Bill joined forces, with Stardust using his powers to open a [[black hole]] behind Asteroth hoping to lock Asteroth in it. However, Asteroth resisted and the hole instead sucked both Stardust and Bill to a near death.

As the two recovered, Stardust had earlier fought Alpha Ray. Galactus had empowered Ray to help Stardust take down his opponent. With the black hole still open, Ray managed to do this, but in return was together with Asteroth sucked into the hole. Stardust has returned off-panel through unknown means, evident by his presence in Annihilation.

===Annihilation===
Stardust is sent by Galactus to ask the Silver Surfer to meet with Galactus<ref>''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' miniseries</ref>. Stardust meanwhile is under orders to help the other remaining former heralds Red Shift and Firelord as they combat the Annihilation wave fleet. Later the three heralds join with Nova's United Front and defeat and capture one of [[Annihilus]]' queens. With the Silver Surfer and Galactus now captured and Firelord half-dead, Stardust and Red Shift are the only two active heralds.

Stardust and [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]] were presumed dead after holding back a massive energy blast from Galactus' absorbing device. Stardust has since returned.<ref name="Annihilation1"/><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #547 (May 2007)</ref>

It is later revealed that Stardust is an Ethereal, a race of beings of pure energy, and that being imbued with the Power Cosmic, in effect, made Stardust indestructible, allowing him to reconstitute himself if "destroyed"<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds Of Galactus – Terrax/Stardust'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]</ref>. He was then confronted by the few remaining members of his race, who were nearly made extinct by the Annihilation Wave.  Accusing Stardust of treason for leaving them, they attacked Stardust, and in the ensuing battle Stardust "kills" the remaining members of his race in self-defense, and then absorbs the remainder of their living energies.  However, he then finds Galactus and, distraught that he has been replaced as Herald by the Silver Surfer, he gives up the remains of his race to feed Galactus, against their protests; an act that surprises Galactus, as no herald has ever willingly given up their race to Galactus. Stardust is then named Galactus's second herald, as Galactus's now increased hunger requires more worlds to devour. It is also then revealed that Galactus is the only creature that Stardust will ever love.

===Gender clarification===
When it first revealed its existence, Stardust claimed that it existed as pure cosmic energy, making it hard to say whether Stardust is a "he" or "she". Though a particular reference to Stardust in ''Fantastic Four'' makes the character appear to be female,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Stardust has been most repeatedly referred to as "he" by other Heralds, Ethereals, and Galactus himself. Stardust was also referred to as "he" in Stormbreaker, his first appearance.
