'''Tempo''', a [[fictional]] character, is an [[African-American]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She was first introduced as a member of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] in ''[[New Mutants]]''.

==Publication history==
Tempo first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #86, though in this cameo appearance she is incorrectly referred to as "[[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]]", the name of one of her teammates. Her first full appearance is in ''New Mutants'' #87.

==Fictional character biography==
===Mutant Liberation Front===
====Stryfe's leadership====
Tempo was a founding member of the [[terrorist]] organization known as the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF). One of their first missions under the leadership of [[Stryfe]] was to liberate the incarcerated mutants, [[Rusty (comics)|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. The MLF broke Rusty and Skids out of prison, after which the pair joined the MLF. Later, it was discovered that neural implants kept them from leaving that organization. Tempo was a mainstay in the team's adventures, including fighting [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and others in the name of mutant rights.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

In the battle with X-Factor, Tempo used her time-bending powers against the super-speedster known as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], however, Tempo and her teammates were defeated and Stryfe was almost captured.<ref>''X-Factor'' #77 (April 1992)</ref> Following that unsuccessful battle, the MLF decided to destroy the Tucker Clinic: an institute for pregnant mothers to undergo [[prenatal]] [[DNA]] testing to determine whether or not their babies would be mutants. X-Factor, acting on an anonymous tip, was able to arrive in time to thwart their attempted destruction, but failed to prevent the death of Dr. Tucker. The MLF retreated, not knowing it was Tempo who gave the tip to X-Factor. Tempo's last name is also Tucker, and the story hints that she might have been related to him, possibly his daughter.<ref>''X-Factor'' #78 (May 1992)</ref>

====Reignfire's leadership====
Soon after, a tyrannical despot named [[Reignfire]] reformed the MLF. One of his first actions was to break Tempo, [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]], [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]], and [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] out of prison, after which he gave them their first mission: kill [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. The MLF also picked up new members [[Locus (comics)|Locus]] and [[Danielle Moonstar|Moonstar]].  The [[assassination]] attempt on Gyrich was foiled by X-Force. Locus and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] are lost, but [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] defected to the MLF after a heated discussion with Gyrich. After Feral's defection, he attacks Gyrich, but Tempo intervenes and stops the attack, after which she was exiled from the MLF by Reignfire. With no other place to go, Tempo leaves with X-Force.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===On her own===
After leaving the MLF, Tempo was invited by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] to join X-Force, which she declined, saying she wanted to go to college and put aside the super-powered lifestyle.{{issue|date=January 2013}} She was again briefly affiliated with the MLF during ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]''.{{issue|date=January 2013}} During this operation, Tempo, Dragoness, [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]], Forearm and [[Danielle Moonstar]] investigated the Wakeman Center, which they suspected of constructing a new strain of the [[Legacy Virus]]. During the mission, a disagreement arose between Wildside and Locus, after which Locus left, stranding Tempo and the others. The stranded MLF members worked with X-Force to escape but only Forearm and Danielle were successful.<ref>''X-Force'' #67 (June 1997)</ref>

===After M-Day===
[[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] was when [[Scarlet Witch]] removed the mutant [[genome]] from over 90% of the world's mutant population.  After that event, Tempo was one of the few to retain her powers. She became a member of the Acolytes, who joined Mr. Sinister's Marauders. During the Marauders' raid on the X-Mansion and in the final battle on Muir Isle, she is knocked out by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. However, even though they were defeated, Tempo's ability to slow time was used to allow the Marauders and Acolytes to escape.<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #1 (3rd series)</ref> After the escape, [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] reformed the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], and Tempo became a member.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===''X-Men: Legacy''===
Professor X was able to enter the Acolytes' secret compound and convinced Exodus to consider joining the X-Men to prepare the mutants for the return of the "messiah child" (Hope Summers) and to prevent events like M-Day from ever happening again. The Acolytes disbanded, with several joining the X-Men, but Tempo remained undecided.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} After Utopia forms, Tempo became part of it, and began to work with the X-Men, fighting against both Emplate and Selene's Army.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===Age of X===
[[Age of X|X]] is a rogue personality of the mutant known as [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]. When reality was warped due to his machinations, Tempo, like all residents of Utopia, was transformed into a soldier of Fortress X.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32903 X-POSITION: MIKE CAREY ON THE "AGE OF X" AFTERMATH], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 22, 2011</ref> A squad leader, she is injured in battle when she attempted to use her powers to slow down the treads of an enemy tank, and she was hit by shrapnel. Though she was successful in stopping the tank, her injuries were fatal, but before she died, her memories were absorbed by [[Rogue (comics)|Legacy]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #245</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tempo can manipulate time.  She is able to slow or stop her opponents, or conversely, speeds up either herself or her teammates. She has prevented a number of grenades from exploding by keeping them in suspended motion, and was also able to successfully attack [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] by amplifying Rogue's speed, causing her to crash into a wall while flying.

Strain limits how long Tempo can maintain a major time manipulation. While it was never established how long that limit is, she was able to completely freeze the X-Men for several minutes while she and the Acolytes conducted a thorough search of the X-Men mansion.<ref>''X-Men'' #202 (Oct. 2007)</ref> Tempo can also levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds.{{Issue|date=January 2013}}

Besides physical protection, Tempo's helmet contains electronics equipment providing her with resistance to Cable's telepathic probes. <ref>''X-Factor'' #78 (May 1992)</ref>
