'''Tempo''' is a fictional, [[African-American]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She was first introduced as a member of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] in the ''[[New Mutants]]'' comic title.

==Fictional character biography==
===Mutant Liberation Front===
====Stryfe's leadership====
Tempo was one of the founding members of the [[terrorist]] organization known as the Mutant Liberation Front (or MLF). One of their first missions under the leadership of [[Stryfe]] was to liberate the incarcerated [[New Mutants]] members [[Rusty (comics)|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. The MLF broke Rusty and Skids out of prison and the pair joined the MLF out of confusion. However, later evidence showed that neural implants kept them there. Tempo continued to be a mainstay in the team's adventures, including fighting [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and other heroes and causing mayhem in the name of mutant rights.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

In the battle with X-Factor, Tempo attempted to use her time-bending powers against the super-speedster known as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. Tempo and her teammates were defeated and Stryfe was almost captured.<ref>''X-Factor'' #77 (April 1992)</ref> Following the unsuccessful battle, the MLF decided to blow up the Tucker Clinic — a place where pregnant mothers can have [[prenatal]] [[DNA]] testing to see whether or not they would have mutant babies. X-Factor showed up in time to stop the clinic from destruction, but they failed to prevent the death of Dr. Tucker. The MLF left, not knowing that it was Tempo who gave the anonymous tip to X-Factor about their plans. As Tempo has the same last name as Dr. Tucker, the story hints that she is related to him, possibly his daughter.<ref>''X-Factor'' #78 (May 1992)</ref>

After a series of supposedly unconnected [[art theft]]s by various strike teams (all of which are related to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]), the members of the MLF approach [[Mister Sinister]] and propose a trade. In exchange for a genetic matrix (none other than the [[Legacy Virus]]) which Stryfe owned, Sinister would hand over the captive [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. These events begin the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' crossover. In the end, all of the MLF members are taken into custody.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

====Reignfire's leadership====
Soon after, a tyrannical despot named [[Reignfire]] decides to restart the MLF. He breaks Tempo, [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]], [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]], and [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] out of prison and gives them their first mission: kill [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. The MLF also picks up new members [[Locus (comics)|Locus]] and [[Danielle Moonstar|Moonstar]], but their [[assassination]] attempt is foiled by X-Force. Locus and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] become lost, but [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] defects to the MLF after having a heated discussion with Gyrich. Tempo intervenes in an attack on Gyrich by Feral, and she is denounced and exiled from the MLF by Reignfire. Having no place to go, Tempo leaves with X-Force.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===On her own===
After leaving the MLF, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] offers Tempo membership to X-Force, which she declines. Instead, she says that she wants to go to college and put aside the super-powered lifestyle.{{issue|date=January 2013}} She was briefly affiliated with the MLF during ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]''.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Tempo, Dragoness, [[Wildside (comics)|Wildslide]], Forearm and [[Danielle Moonstar]] investigate the Wakeman Center and the possibility they are constructing a new strain of the [[Legacy Virus]]. Wildside irrationally hits Locus, who leaves, stranding Tempo and the others. They work with X-Force to escape but the only MLF members who do are Forearm and Danielle.<ref>''X-Force'' #67 (June 1997)</ref>

===After M-Day===
When the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] occurred, where the [[Scarlet Witch]] removed the mutant [[genome]] from over 90% of the world's mutant population, Tempo was one of the few to retain her powers. In the events leading up to Messiah Complex, she was among the Acolytes who joined Mr. Sinister's Marauders. She participates in the Marauders' raid on the X-Mansion and in the final battle on Muir Isle, where she is knocked out by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Tempo's ability to slow time was used to give the Marauders and Acolytes an escape after their defeat and the shooting of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], who was taken with them.<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #1 (3rd series)</ref> After the escape, Tempo becomes a member of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] as recreated by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===X-Men Legacy===
Professor X is able to enter the Acolytes' secret compound and convinced Exodus to consider joining the X-Men to prepare the mutants for the return of the "messiah child" (Hope Summers), and also to prevent events like M-Day from ever happening again. The Acolytes disband, with several joining the X-Men, but Tempo is undecided.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

After Utopia forms, Tempo moves into it, and begins to work with the X-Men, fighting both Emplate and Selene's Army.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===Age of X===
When reality is warped due the machinations of [[Age of X|X]], a rogue personality of the mutant known as [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]], Tempo, like all residents of Utopia, is transformed into a soldier of Fortress X. A squad leader, she is injured in battle when her attempts to use her powers to slow down the treads of an enemy tank backfired and she was struck by the resulting shrapnel. Though she is successful in stopping the tank, her injuries were fatal and before she dies, her memories were absorbed by [[Rogue (comics)|Legacy]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #245</ref> Due to the nature of the reality warp, all of the residents of Fortress X are the actual residents of Utopia transformed in mind and body by Legion’s power.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32903 X-POSITION: MIKE CAREY ON THE "AGE OF X" AFTERMATH], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 22, 2011</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tempo can manipulate time.  Most often she slows or stops her opponents or speeds herself or her teammates. She has been able to prevent a number of grenades from exploding by keeping them in suspended motion, and she was also able to successfully attack [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] by amplifying her own personal speed to cause her to crash into a wall while flying.

Strain provides a time limit on how long Tempo can maintain a major time manipulation. It is not established how long that limit is, but she was able to completely freeze the X-Men and surrounding Sentinels for several minutes while she and the Acolytes conducted a thorough search of the X-Men mansion.<ref>''X-Men'' #202 (Oct. 2007)</ref> Tempo can also levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds.{{Issue|date=January 2013}}

Besides physical protection, Tempo's helmet contains communications equipment which has provided her with resistance to Cable's telepathic probes. Tempo displays an emotional connection to Dr. Tucker of the ''Tucker Clinic'', warning him when she believes the MLF are planning an attack. It is hinted that Dr. Tucker may be her father.<ref>''X-Factor'' #78 (May 1992)</ref>
