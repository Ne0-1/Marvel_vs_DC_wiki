'''Tempo''' is a fictional, [[African-American]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] villainess in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She was first introduced as a member of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] in the comic title ''[[New Mutants]]'', when [[Rob Liefeld]] took over as the penciller of that series. Although she was first allied with villains, she was able to see the error of her ways and retire to a normal life.

==Fictional character biography==
===Mutant Liberation Front===
====Stryfe's leadership====
Tempo was one of the founding members of the [[terrorist]] organization known as the Mutant Liberation Front (or MLF). One of their first missions under the leadership of [[Stryfe]] was to liberate the incarcerated [[New Mutants]] members [[Rusty (comics)|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. They broke them out of prison and the pair joined the MLF out of confusion (and, as later evidence showed, neural implants kept them there). Tempo continued to be a mainstay in the team's ventures, including fighting [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Sunfire]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and other heroes while causing mayhem in the name of mutant rights.

In the battle with X-Factor, Tempo attempts to use her time-bending powers against the super-speedster known as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], but she—along with her teammates—discover that X-Factor is a much tougher foe than X-Force when they are defeated and Stryfe is almost captured.

Following the unsuccessful battle, the MLF decides to blow up the Tucker Clinic—a place where pregnant mothers can have [[prenatal]] [[DNA]] testing to see whether or not they would have mutant babies. X-Factor shows up in time to stop the clinic from destructing, but they fail to prevent the death of Dr. Tucker. The MLF leaves, not knowing that it was Tempo who had given an anonymous tip to X-Factor about their plans.

After a series of supposedly unconnected art thefts by various strike teams (all of which are related to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]), the members of the MLF approach [[Mister Sinister]] and propose a trade. In exchange for a genetic matrix (none other than the [[Legacy Virus]]) which Stryfe owned, Sinister would hand over the captive [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. These events begin the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' crossover. In the end, all of the MLF members are taken into custody.

====Reignfire's leadership====
Soon after, a tyrannical despot named [[Reignfire]] decides to restart the MLF. He breaks Tempo, [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]], [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]], and [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] out of prison and gives them their first mission: kill [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. The MLF also picks up new members [[Locus (comics)|Locus]] and [[Danielle Moonstar|Moonstar]]. Their [[assassination]] attempt is foiled by X-Force, Locus and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] become lost, but [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] defects to the MLF after having a heated discussion with Gyrich. Tempo intervenes in an attack on Gyrich by Feral and is denounced and exiled from the MLF by Stryfe. Having no place to go, Tempo leaves with X-Force. 

===On her own===
After leaving the MLF, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] offers Tempo membership to X-Force, which she declines. Instead, she says that she wants to go off to college and put aside the super-powered lifestyle.

Whether she made it to school or not is a mystery, but when the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] occurred--where the [[Scarlet Witch]] removed the mutant [[genome]] from over 90% of the world's mutant population--Tempo was one of the few to retain her powers. It is unknown if she continued in her clandestine life or if she will soon be seen again.

==Powers==
Tempo's mutant ability allows her to psychically manipulate others perceptions of time, giving the illusion that time has slowed, or that she and anyone else unaffected are moving at high speeds. Those she affects may be tired or drained afterward, and extended exposure puts great stress on the subject's body. She can also fly.

==Notes==
Although it was never fully established, it was presumed that Tempo was related to Dr. Tucker of the Tucker clinic (presumably her father).
