'''Tempo''' is a fictional, [[African-American]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] villain in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She was first introduced as a member of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] in the comic title ''[[New Mutants]]'', when [[Rob Liefeld]] took over as the penciller of that series. Although she was first allied with villains, she once seemed to see error in those ways and retire to a normal life.

==Fictional character biography==
===Mutant Liberation Front===
====Stryfe's leadership====
Tempo was one of the founding members of the [[terrorist]] organization known as the Mutant Liberation Front (or MLF). One of their first missions under the leadership of [[Stryfe]] was to liberate the incarcerated [[New Mutants]] members [[Rusty (comics)|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. They broke them out of prison and the pair joined the MLF out of confusion (and, as later evidence showed, neural implants kept them there). Tempo continued to be a mainstay in the team's ventures, including fighting [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and other heroes while causing mayhem in the name of mutant rights.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

In the battle with X-Factor, Tempo attempts to use her time-bending powers against the super-speedster known as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], but she—along with her teammates—discover that X-Factor is a much tougher foe than X-Force when they are defeated and Stryfe is almost captured.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Following the unsuccessful battle, the MLF decides to blow up the Tucker Clinic—a place where pregnant mothers can have [[prenatal]] [[DNA]] testing to see whether or not they would have mutant babies. X-Factor shows up in time to stop the clinic from destructing, but they fail to prevent the death of Dr. Tucker. The MLF leaves, not knowing that it was Tempo who had given an anonymous tip to X-Factor about their plans. Due to Tempo having the same last name as Dr. Tucker, it is heavily hinted that she is related to him, or possibly his daughter.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

After a series of supposedly unconnected [[art theft]]s by various strike teams (all of which are related to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]), the members of the MLF approach [[Mister Sinister]] and propose a trade. In exchange for a genetic matrix (none other than the [[Legacy Virus]]) which Stryfe owned, Sinister would hand over the captive [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. These events begin the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' crossover. In the end, all of the MLF members are taken into custody.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

====Reignfire's leadership====
Soon after, a tyrannical despot named [[Reignfire]] decides to restart the MLF. He breaks Tempo, [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]], [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]], and [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] out of prison and gives them their first mission: kill [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. The MLF also picks up new members [[Locus (comics)|Locus]] and [[Danielle Moonstar|Moonstar]]. Their [[assassination]] attempt is foiled by X-Force, Locus and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] become lost, but [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] defects to the MLF after having a heated discussion with Gyrich. Tempo intervenes in an attack on Gyrich by Feral and is denounced and exiled from the MLF by Reignfire. Having no place to go, Tempo leaves with X-Force.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===On her own===
After leaving the MLF, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] offers Tempo membership to X-Force, which she declines. Instead, she says that she wants to go off to college and put aside the super-powered lifestyle. She was briefly affiliated with the MLF during ''[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]''. In ''X-Force Vol 1'' #67, Tempo, Dragoness, [[Wildside (comics)|Wildslide]], Forearm and [[Danielle Moonstar]] investigate the Wakeman Center and the possibility they are constructing a new strain of the [[Legacy Virus]]. Wildside irrationally hits Locus, who leaves, stranding Tempo and the others. They work with X-Force to escape but the only MLF members who do are Forearm and Danielle.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===After M-Day===
When the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] occurred, where the [[Scarlet Witch]] removed the mutant [[genome]] from over 90% of the world's mutant population, Tempo was one of the few to retain her powers. She is now a member of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] as re-created by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

She participates in the Acolytes' raid on the X-Mansion and in the final battle on Muir Isle, where she is knocked out by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Tempo's ability to slow time was used to give the Acolytes an escape after their defeat and the shooting of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], who was taken with them.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===X-Men Legacy===
Professor X was able to enter the Acolytes secret compound and convinced Exodus to consider joining the X-Men to prepare the mutants for the return of the "messiah child" (Hope Summers), and also to prevent things like M-Day from ever happening again.  The Acolytes disbanded, with several joining the X-Men, but Tempo was undecided.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

After Utopia was formed, Tempo moved into it, and began to work with the X-Men, fighting both Emplate and Selene's Army.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===Age of X and possible death===

When reality was warped due the machinations of [[Age of X|X]], a rogue personality of the mutant known as [[Legion (comics)|Legion]], Tempo, like all residents of Utopia, was transformed into a soldier of Fortress X. A squad leader, she was injured in battle when her attempts to use her powers to slow down the treads of an enemy tank backfired and she was struck by the resulting shrapnel. Though she was successful in stopping the tank, her injuries were fatal and before she died, her memories were absorbed by [[Rogue (comics)|Legacy]].{{Issue|date=May 2011}} Due to the nature of the reality warp, all of the residents of Fortress X were the actual residents of Utopia transformed in mind and body by Legion’s power and as such, when Tempo died in the altered reality, it's possible that her death carried over into the true, corrected reality. <ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32903 X-POSITION: MIKE CAREY ON THE "AGE OF X" AFTERMATH],  [[Comic Book Resources]], June 22, 2011</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tempo can manipulate time.  Most often she slows or stops her opponents or speeds herself or her teammates.  She has been able to prevent a number of grenades from exploding by keeping them in suspended motion, and she was also able to successfully attack [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] by amplifying her own personal speed to cause her to crash into a wall while flying.

Strain provides a time limit on how long Tempo can maintain a major time manipulation.  It is not established how long that limit is, but she was able to completely freeze the X-Men and surrounding Sentinels for several minutes while she and the Acolytes conducted a thorough search of the X-Men mansion.<ref>''X-Men'' #202</ref>

Tempo can also levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds.

== Notes ==
Besides physical protection, Tempo's helmet contains communications equipment and it has provided her with resistance to Cable's telepathic probes.  Tempo displays an emotional connection to Dr. Tucker of the ''Tucker Clinic'', warning him when she believes the MLF are planning an attack.  It is hinted that he may be her father.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}
