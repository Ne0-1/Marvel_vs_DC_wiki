'''T'Challa''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Chadwick Boseman]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]]—based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Black Panther (character)|of the same name]]—commonly known by his [[Pseudonym|alias]], the [[title|appointed title]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Koch |first1=Andrew |title=Wakanda Forever: The Black Panther Family Tree |url=https://www.familytreemagazine.com/entertainment/black-panther-family-tree/ |website=familytreemagazine.com |publisher=[[Family Tree (magazine)|Family Tree]] |access-date=30 September 2021}}</ref> of '''Black Panther'''. He is depicted as the king of the fictional [[Africa|African]] nation of [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]. He initially comes into conflict with some of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] but later allies with them against [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]. 

T'Challa made his first appearance in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), and appeared in four films, making his final [[live action]] appearance in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). After Boseman died of [[colon cancer]] in August 2020,<ref name="apnews.com"/> [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that the character would not be recast nor would a [[digital double]] be used, and he will not appear in the [[Black Panther: Wakanda Forever|upcoming sequel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/10/entertainment/black-panther-chadwick-boseman/index.html|title=Black Panther will not be recast following Chadwick Boseman's death|first1=Sandra|last1=Gonzalez|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=December 10, 2020|access-date=December 12, 2020|archive-date=December 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201211030748/https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/10/entertainment/black-panther-chadwick-boseman/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> This decision was met with some controversy, and in 2021 a [[Change.org]] petition was started calling on Marvel Studios to recast T'Challa, and Boseman's brother commented that he would want the role recast.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fashingbauer Cooper |first1=Gael |title=Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman would want T'Challa role recast, brother says |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/black-panthers-chadwick-boseman-would-want-his-tchalla-role-recast-brother-says/ |website=cnet.com |publisher=[[CNET]] |access-date=21 December 2021 |date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

Boseman's performance as T'Challa is notable as one of the first [[black people|black]] superheroes in a big-budget film, receiving critical acclaim, and his [[Black Panther (2018 film)|titular film]] became the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth-<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

[[#Alternate variants|Alternate variants]] of T'Challa appear in the animated series, ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021–present), with Boseman posthumously reprising the role. Most notable is a depiction of T'Challa as '''Star-Lord''', based on the Marvel Comics character [[Star-Lord|of the same name]]. In October 2021, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series centered on the [[#Star-Lord|Star-Lord T'Challa variant]] was revealed to be in [[development hell]] due to Boseman's death.<ref name="VarietyOct2021">{{Cite web |last=Vary |first=Adam B. |date=October 6, 2021 |title=Inside Marvel's 'What If…?'

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
===Comics origin===
[[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] created Black Panther due to Lee's desire in the mid-60s to include more African and African-American characters in Marvel Comics. In a 1998 interview, Lee explained his motivation: "I wasn't thinking of civil rights. I had a lot of friends who were black and we had artists who were black. So it occurred to me... why aren't there any black heroes?"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brodsky |first1=Bob |title=Stan the Man Lee: Maestro of the Marvel Mythos |journal=Comic Book Marketplace |date=July 1998 |issue=61 |pages=28–36, 45–54}}</ref> The name, Black Panther, was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a [[black panther]] as a helper.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 38–39|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/coaltigergatherers.htm COAL Tiger] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224161826/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/coaltigergatherers.htm |date=February 24, 2020 }}, marvunapp.com</ref> Influences on the character included historical figures such as 14th-century [[Mali Empire]] sultan [[Mansa Musa]] and 20th-century Jamaican activist [[Marcus Garvey]], as well as [[Biblical]] figures such as [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morrow|first1=John|last2=Kirby|first2=Jack|title=Collected Jack Kirby Collector|date=2004|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|isbn=9781893905009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KI-et-e206EC&pg=PA216|language=en}}</ref>

There was some internal debate at Marvel about how far to go with the commercially risky introduction of a black superhero. In the first version of the cover for ''Fantastic Four'' #52, the Black Panther wore a cowl that exposed his face. In the published version, the cowl became a full face-mask. Previews in other comics didn't show the cover at all, indicating that Marvel was unsure how much to reveal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Sean |title=Marvel Comics: The Untold Story |date=2013 |publisher=Harper Perennial |isbn=978-0061992117 |chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref> Following his debut in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52–53 (July–Aug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967) and with [[Captain America]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #97–100 (Jan.– April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda]] to [[New York City]] to join the titular American superhero team in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years.

===Adaptation to film===
In 2004, David Maisel was hired as chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance movies.<ref name="fortune1">{{Cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100034246/index2.htm |title=Marvel goes Hollywood |last=Leonard |first=Devin |date=May 23, 2007 |work=Fortune |access-date=December 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113165739/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100034246/index2.htm |archive-date=November 13, 2013 |page=2}}</ref> Marvel entered into a [[non-recourse debt]] structure with [[Merrill Lynch]], under which Marvel got $525&nbsp;million to make a maximum of 10 movies based on the company's properties over eight years, collateralized by certain movie rights to a total of 10 characters, including Black Panther.<ref name="lat">{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |title=Marvel to Make Movies Based on Comic Books |last=Vincent |first=Roger |date=September 6, 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ory848wW?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |archive-date=April 16, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

During the events of ''Civil War'', motivated by revenge for [[T'Chaka (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|his father]]'s death during the UN signing of the [[Sokovia Accords]] in the aftermath of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', T'Challa joins [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s faction to oppose [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] as he is protecting the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]] who was implicated for the attack. However, T'Challa learns the bombing attack was actually arranged by [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]] to orchestrate his own revenge on the Avengers for inadvertently creating the [[Battle of Sokovia|Sokovia crisis]] which killed his family. After hearing Zemo's confession as he succeeded in turning Stark and Rogers against each other, T'Challa renounces his revenge while preventing Zemo's suicide and handing him over to [[Everett K. Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Everett K. Ross]]. T'Challa grants Rogers and Barnes sanctuary in Wakanda while also aiding in the latter's recovery from his [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] brainwashing.

T'Challa is a prince of the African nation of [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]], who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb,<ref name="HeartShapedHerb">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/black-panther-powers-herb-explained/|title=Black Panther Director Explains T'Challa's Powers|last=Donn|first=Emily|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=June 9, 2017|access-date=June 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610180314/http://screenrant.com/black-panther-powers-herb-explained/|archive-date=June 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> allied with Stark.<ref name="VarietyAug2015">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/captain-america-civil-war-concept-art-hawkeye-black-widow-1201579801/ |title='Captain America: Civil War' Concept Art Shows Where Each Avenger's Loyalties Lie |last=Kroll |first=Justin |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 27, 2015 |access-date=August 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828060055/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/captain-america-civil-war-concept-art-hawkeye-black-widow-1201579801/ |archive-date=August 28, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="FandangoMarch2016">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/captain-america-civil-war-set-visit-this-is-the-godfather-of-superhero-movies-750571 |title='Captain America: Civil War' Set Visit: "This Is the 'Godfather' of Superhero Movies" |last=Davis |first=Erik |work=Fandango.com |date=March 7, 2016 |access-date=March 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310050903/http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/captain-america-civil-war-set-visit-this-is-the-godfather-of-superhero-movies-750571 |archive-date=March 10, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Oct2014EventQA">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-phase-3-kevin-feige/ |title=Watch: All Of Your Marvel Phase 3 Questions Answered By Marvel Head Kevin Feige |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |website=[[/Film]] |date=October 28, 2014 |access-date=October 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031302/http://www.slashfilm.com/marvel-phase-3-kevin-feige/ |archive-date=October 29, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Boseman" /><ref name="EWBlackPantherDec2015">{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/02/black-panther-captain-america-civil-war |title=Black Panther: Meet Marvel's fearsome warrior from Captain America: Civil War |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=December 2, 2015 |access-date=December 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203085900/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/02/black-panther-captain-america-civil-war |archive-date=December 3, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Producer Kevin Feige explained that the character was included "because we needed a third party.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pursuit of Bucky Barnes===
{{further|Captain America: Civil War}}
At a conference in [[Vienna]] where the [[Sokovia Accords]] governing superhero activity are to be ratified, a bomb kills T'Challa's father, King [[T'Chaka (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Chaka]] of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], whom T'Challa vows to kill. [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]]. Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]] recites the trigger words to activate Barnes' brainwashing, and sends Barnes on a rampage to cover his own escape. Barnes briefly fights T'Challa while fleeing the building, where Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away, recruiting several other Avengers to help him go after Zemo. [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] assembles his own team composed of T'Challa, [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], Rhodes, [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they fight (including personal confrontations against Barnes, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang as Giant-Man]], and [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]]), until Romanoff shocks T'Challa to allow Rogers and Barnes to escape. T'Challa tracks Rogers and Barnes to a Siberian Hydra facility, discovering that Zemo is the true perpetrator. While Rogers and Barnes are fighting Stark, T'Challa stops Zemo from committing suicide and takes him to the authorities. T'Challa grants Barnes asylum in Wakanda, where Barnes chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found.

===King of Wakanda===
{{further|Black Panther (film)}}
With T'Chaka having died, T'Challa assumes the throne. He and [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], the leader of the [[Dora Milaje (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dora Milaje]] regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover [[Nakia (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nakia]] from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother [[Ramonda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ramonda]] and younger sister [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]]. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]] challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. Although M'Baku initially has the upper hand, T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.

When [[Ulysses Klaue (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ulysses Klaue]] and his accomplice [[Killmonger (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Erik Stevens]] steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover [[W'Kabi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|W'Kabi]] urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to [[CIA]] agent [[Everett K. Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Everett K. Ross]]. A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue; Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him. As Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts [[Zuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Zuri]] about [[N'Jobu]]. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. [[black ops]] soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first.

Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated. T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the [[United Nations]] to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world.

===Infinity War and resurrection===
{{further|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}
In 2018, T'Challa brings a new robotic arm to Barnes. He then welcomes Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, Rhodes, [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], Maximoff, and Vision when they arrive in Wakanda, so Shuri can work on Vision. He along with the Wakandan army, Barnes, Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, Rhodes, and Banner fight off the oncoming onslaught of [[Species of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Outriders|Outriders]] and witnesses the arrival of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. However, [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] arrives in Wakanda and completes and activates the Infinity Gauntlet, killing half of all life in the universe. As a result, T’Challa disintegrates.

In 2023, T'Challa is restored to life when the surviving Avengers recreate the [[Infinity Gauntlet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Infinity Gauntlet]]. He and the Wakandan army are brought by [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] to the destroyed [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]] to join in the final battle against a past version of Thanos. After Tony Stark's sacrifice and Thanos' defeat, T'Challa attends Stark's funeral.

In an alternate 1988, the [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravagers]] are sent to Earth by the Celestial [[Ego (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ego]] to retrieve his son [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]]. However, they mistakenly abduct a young T'Challa who agrees to join them in exploring the galaxy.

20 years later, T'Challa becomes a famous galactic outlaw mercenary known as "[[Star-Lord]]". After acquiring the Orb containing the [[Power Stone (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Stone]] on Morag, T'Challa and the Ravagers are approached by [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], who proposes a heist to steal the Embers of Genesis, a cosmic dust form capable of terraforming ecosystems. Nebula and [[Yondu Udonta (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yondu Udonta]] meet with [[Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taneleer Tivan]] on [[Knowhere (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Knowhere]], while T'Challa infiltrates his collection to find the Embers.

He discovers a Wakandan spacecraft containing a message from his father, T'Chaka. Nebula seemingly betrays the Ravagers, leading to T'Challa being captured and put on display for Tivan's assessment. She later rescues the Ravagers, revealing that she and T'Challa planned a ruse so she could acquire the Embers. T'Challa manages to escape his confinement and battles Tivan with Udonta's help. The two trap Tivan in his own display before handing over control to his assistant Carina. Afterwards, the Ravagers head to Earth, where T'Challa reunites with his parents and younger sister on Wakanda.

T'Challa leads the Ravagers to battle [[Ego (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ego]] on Earth and save Peter Quill before the [[Watcher (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Watcher]] emerges and recruits him to join the [[Guardians of the Multiverse]] with the mission to defeat a variant of [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] who is attempting to destroy reality. T'Challa joins [[Doctor Strange Supreme]], [[Captain Carter]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], and [[Killmonger (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Killmonger]] in a battle against Ultron. During the fight, T'Challa steals the [[Soul Stone]] in order to reduce Ultron's powers, but the Guardians are still overwhelmed. They eventually succeed after Natasha Romanoff injects [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]]'s analog consciousness into Ultron's AI, shutting him down. T'Challa returns to his universe and teaches Quill how to shoot a blaster.

===Zombie outbreak===
{{Main|What If... Zombies?!}}
In an alternate 2018, T'Challa accompanies the Avengers to [[San Francisco]] in an attempt to contain a quantum virus unintentionally released by [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] and [[Janet van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Janet van Dyne]]. As the Avengers are attacked and turned into [[zombies]], T'Challa is rescued by Vision, but he soon learns that Vision only saved him so he could harvest T'Challa's body for the infected [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]]. When the remaining survivors arrive at Vision's base, [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] finds T'Challa missing his right leg. As most of the heroes sacrifice themselves to fend off Maximoff and the rest of the zombies, T'Challa, [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] take the Quadjet to Wakanda, hoping to use Vision's Mind Stone to find a way to cure the population. Unbeknownst to them, Wakanda has been infected and taken over by a zombified Thanos.

However, he is lured into a trap by Killmonger, who proceeds to kill both T'Challa and Rhodes, sparking a conflict between the United States and Wakanda. As a funeral for T'Challa is held in Wakanda, Killmonger convinces the Wakandans that T'Challa was killed by Rhodes and earns their trust.
