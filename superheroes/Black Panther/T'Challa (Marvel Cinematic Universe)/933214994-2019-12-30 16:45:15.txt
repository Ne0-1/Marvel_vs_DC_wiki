As of [[Black Panther (film)|the 2018 film ''Black Panther'']], he wears a new variant of the suit that can absorb kinetic energy (represented as purple highlights) and release it as a light purple shockwave after enough energy has been amassed. It can also fold into a silver necklace.
* During the events of ''Civil War'', motivated by revenge for his father's death during the UN signing of the Sokovian Accords in the aftermath of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', T'Challa joins Iron Man's faction to oppose Captain America as he is protecting the Winter Soldier who was implicated for the attack. But T'Challa learns the bombing attack was actually arranged by Helmut Zemo to orchestrate his own revenge on the Avengers for inadvertently creating the [[Avengers: Age of Ultron|Sokovia crisis]] which killed his family. After hearing Zemo's confession as he succeeded in turning Stark and Rogers against each other, T'Challa renounces his revenge while preventing Zemo's suicide and handing him over to [[Everett K. Ross]]. T'Challa grants Rogers and Barnes sanctuary in Wakanda while also aiding in the latter's recovery from his [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] brainwashing.
