The '''Black Panther''' ('''T'Challa''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and penciller and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], he [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #52 (July 1966). He is the first [[Black people|black]] superhero in mainstream American comics, debuting several years before such early [[African-American]] superheroes as Marvel Comics' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Luke Cage]], and [[DC Comics]]' [[Tyroc]], [[Black Lightning]], and [[Green Lantern]] [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]. The Black Panther was ranked the 79th greatest comic-book character by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine. [[IGN]] ranked the character the 51st greatest comic-book hero.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/51, ''IGN's Top 100 Super Heroes''] May 6, 2011</ref> [[Chadwick Boseman]] will play the Black Panther in several scheduled films as a part of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

==Concept and creation==

===Name===
The Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|Black Panthers]] Tank Battalion.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183 |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |last= Cronin|first= Brian |date= December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |work= H.K. Yuen Social Movement Archive }}</ref> He is the first black <!--rather than "African" since Western Lobo is not African but African-American; "Black" is capitalized per AP Stylebook--> superhero in mainstream [[comic book]]s; virtually no black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution ''[[All-Negro Comics]]'' #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title ''[[Jungle Tales]]'', from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]; and the [[Dell Comics]] [[Western comics|Western]] character [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-[[caricature]]d Black supporting characters in comics include [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[infantry]] private [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]] of ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]''.

===Publication history<!--subhead per WikiProject Comics style-->===
Following his debut in ''Fantastic Four'' #52-53 (July-Aug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967) and with [[Captain America]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #97-99 (Jan.-March 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] to [[New York City]], [[New York]] to join the titular American superhero team in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'',<!--Note to researchers--#s 52, 69, 92; 56 was a cameo, and 99 was with Avengers, as were his ''Hulk'' and ''Sub-Mariner'' appearances--> and fought [[Doctor Doom]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6-7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that [[supervillain]]'s short-lived starring feature. He later returned in a guest-appearance capacity in ''Fantastic Four'' #119 (Feb. 1972) during which he briefly tried using the name '''Black Leopard''' to avoid connotations invoking the Black-militant [[political party]] the Black Panthers.<ref>When Fantastic Four member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] asked about the name change, T'Challa responded, "I contemplate a return to ''your'' country, Ben Grimm, where the latter term has —''political'' connotations. I neither condemn nor condone those who have taken up the name, but ''T'Challa'' is a law unto ''himself''. Hence, the ''new'' name—a ''minor'' point, at best, since the panther ''is'' a leopard."</ref>

He received his first starring feature with ''[[Jungle Action]]'' #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in ''The Avengers'' #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by [[Don McGregor]], with art by [[pencilers]] [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gil Kane]], and [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]], and which gave inkers [[Klaus Janson]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]] some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed<ref name=dmd>{{cite web|authorlink=Dwayne McDuffie| last=McDuffie|first= Dwayne|url=http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/TBC3.html |title=To Be Continued|publisher= (column #3), Dwayne McDuffie official site|date=n.d.|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5npmJ5djk | archivedate= February 26, 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref> series ran in ''Jungle Action'' #6-24 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1976).<ref name=gcd2>[http://www.comics.org/series/2053/ ''Jungle Action'', Marvel, 1973 Series], at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

One now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.<ref name="sacks">{{cite web|last=Sacks|first=Jason|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/columns/693/panthers-rage/ |title=Panther's Rage|publisher=ComicsBulletin.com| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704142442/http://www.fanboyplanet.com/comics/js-panthersrage.php | archivedate= July 4, 2008}} Additional [http://www.webcitation.org/5nplRLNpI WebCitation archive].</ref> The first, "Panther's Rage", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc "Marvel's first [[graphic novel]]":
{{quote|text=[T]here were real character arcs in [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] [comics] over time. But ... 'Panther's Rage' is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of ''Jungle Action'' (#s 6 through 18), 'Panther's Rage' is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.<ref name="sacks" />}}

The second and final arc, "Panther vs. the Klan", ran as mostly 17-page stories in ''Jungle Action'' #19-24 (Jan.-Nov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of ''Daredevil'' #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.<ref name=gcd2 /> The subject matter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.<ref>McGregor, Don. "Panther's Chronicles" (introduction), ''Marvel Masterworks: The Black Panther Vol. 1'' (Marvel Worldwide, 2010), pp. xii-xii (unnumbered).</ref>

African-American writer-editor [[Dwayne McDuffie]] said of the ''Jungle Action'' "Black Panther" feature:
{{quote|text=This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.<ref name=dmd />}}

Though popular with college students, the overall sales of ''Jungle Action'' were low,<ref name="Back27">{{cite journal|last= Stewart|first= Tom|date= April 2008|title= The Blackest Panther: Don McGregor in the Jungles of Wakanda|journal= [[Back Issue!]]| issue= 27|pages= 57–61|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> and Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character's co-creator [[Jack Kirby]]—newly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival [[DC Comics]] for a time— as writer, penciler, and editor.

Writer [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]'s and penciller [[Mark Texeira]]'s 1998 series ''The Black Panther'' vol. 3 utilized [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Venomm]],<!--spelled correctly with double M--> and other characters introduced in "Panther's Rage", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protégé, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. "I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to," adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.<ref>{{Cite news| first=Ethan|last= Sacks| url= | title=The unsung heroes: Blade & Co. help to close racial divide| publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]]| date=2002-03-19 }}</ref>

The last 13 issues (#50-62) saw the main character replaced by a [[multiracial]] [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officer]] named [[Kasper Cole]], with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], was placed in the series ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]'', running concurrently with the final few ''Black Panther'' issues. ''The Crew'' was canceled with issue #7.

==Fictional character biography==
{{In-universe|section|date=February 2015}}

===Early life and background===
[[File:Avengers52.jpg|thumb|left|Cover detail, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968): Debut of the short-lived cowl mask. Art by [[John Buscema]].]]
The Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one still must earn it.

In the distant past, a [[meteorite]] made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, '''King T'Chaka''', like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with '''T'Challa''', and his second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of [[South Africa]], so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #13-37 (February - December 1989)</ref> T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]] in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering his right hand and forcing him to flee.<ref name="FF53">''Fantastic Four'' #53 (August 1966)</ref>

T'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan [[walkabout]] [[rite of passage]], T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (Dec. 1980), revised in ''Storm'' vol. 2, #1-6 (2006)</ref> The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.

T'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zeraze—the Wakandan [[secret police]]—and its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = Richard S an Comicraft Letters|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = The Price|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #4|date = February 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.<ref name="FF53"/> Later, to keep peace, he picked ''dora milaje'' ("adored ones") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time <!--Under "Powers & abilities, it says his Ph.D. is from Oxford University, in Oxford, England. Here the phrase says: in [[New York City]]--> before returning to his kingship.

In his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and neutralizes them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #52-53 (July-Aug. 1966)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/#more-60191 |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 262 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=September 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 4, 2015}}</ref> After the ruler makes proper amends to the superhero team, the four befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967)</ref> T'Challa later joins the Avengers,<ref>''The Avengers'' #52 (May 1968)</ref> beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the [[Man-Ape]] while with the group,<ref>''Avengers'' #62 (March 1969)</ref> and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,<ref>''The Avengers'' #73 (Feb. 1970)</ref> with whom he becomes romantically involved.

===Return to Wakanda===
The Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,<ref>''[[Jungle Action]]'' #6-18 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1975)</ref> the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #19-22 & 24 (Jan.-July & Nov. 1976)</ref> He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as [[King Solomon's Frogs]].<ref>''Black Panther'' #1-4 (Jan. - July 1977)</ref> These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, [[telepathy|telepathic]] Panther with a terminal [[cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]], whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.

Later, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during [[Apartheid]].<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #13-37 (Late Feb. - December 1989)</ref> T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #1-4 (May-Oct. 1991)</ref> though the couple never marry.

Years later, the Panther accepts a [[Washington, D.C.]] envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is 'Xcon', an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol.3) #1-12 (November 1998 - October 1999)</ref> Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to [[nationalize]] foreign companies.<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol.3) #13-19 (December 1999 - June 2000)</ref> Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol.3) #20 (July 2000)</ref> but falls into a [[coma]] upon eating the heart-shaped herb—poisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol.3) #24 (November 2000)</ref> T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.

Later, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol.3) #49 (November 2002)</ref> and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.

As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #8</ref> He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5, #9-10">''Black Panther'' vol. 5, #9-10</ref> which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.<ref>''Doomwar'' #5</ref>

===The Man Without Fear===
After the events of "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]", Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of [[Foggy Nelson]], T'Challa assumes the identity of '''Mr. Okonkwo''', an immigrant from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Congo]] and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle">{{Cite book|title=Black Panther: The Man Without Fear ''Urban Jungle'' |first=David |last=Liss |isbn=978-0-7851-4523-3 |year=2011}}</ref>

T'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself "The Impaler". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

T'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of children - Gabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

===Wakanda again===
Shortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]|penciller=Camuncoli, Giuseppe|inker=[[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|story=City of the Dead|title=Fantastic Four|volume=1|issue=#608|date=July 18, 2012|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}</ref> Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller=[[Adam Kubert|Kubert, Adam]]|inker=Dell, John|story=Avengers Vs.

==Powers and abilities==
The title "Black Panther" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special Heart-Shaped Herb which, in addition to his mystical connection with the Wakandan Panther God, grants him superhumanly acute senses and increases his strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, and agility to [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-levels. He has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5, #9-10"/> His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/> In addition to the resurgence of his abilities, he is anointed "King of the Dead", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the [[Marvel Zombies (series)|undead]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Johnathan Hickman|Hickman, Johnathan]]||title=Secret Wars|volume=1|issue=#7|date=November 11, 2015|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}</ref>

As king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, as well as the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.

He is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and [[scientist]]. He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Physics]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. Considered one of the eight smartest people on the planet,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #601</ref> he is a genius in physics and advanced technology, and is a brilliant inventor. He also has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/>

T'Challa is a rigorously trained gymnast and acrobat and is a master in various African martial arts as well as contemporary martial arts and fighting styles that belong to no known disciplines.

The chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, though financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite book|title= Superheroes!:Capes cowls and the creation of comic book culture|first=Glen |last=Weldon|first2=Michael |last2=Kantor|page=170}}</ref>

===Volume 3===
Journalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer "turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it". Gross applauded the title's "endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels".<ref>{{Cite news| first=Joe|last= Gross |first2= Jeff |last2=Salamon | url= | title=Five comic books you (or your kids)* should be reading | publisher=[[Austin American-Statesman]] | date=2002-05-30 }}</ref>

Comics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. "Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the ''Spider-Man'' comics, I want to like ''Black Panther'', but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?"<ref>{{Cite news| first=Mike |last=Sangiacomo | url= | title=Tips on what to buy, avoid with budget in mind | work=[[The Plain Dealer]] | date=2000-04-01 }}</ref>

Reporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. "I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching '[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]' in rewind. My head is exploding.'"<ref>{{Cite news| first=Bill |last=Radford| url= | title=Marvel Knights books put new spin on classic heroes| work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] | location = [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]| date=1998-11-05 }}</ref>

===Volume 4===
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave a negative review to the first arc, "Who Is The Black Panther?", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, "Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing".<ref>{{Cite news| url= | title=Black Panther: Who Is the Black Panther?| work=[[Publishers Weekly]]| date=2005-10-17 }}</ref>

Journalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a "fairly unimpressive launch". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. "He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough".<ref>{{Cite news| first=Shawn |last=Jeffords | url= | title=Is the Black Panther back?| publisher=[[Sarnia Observer]]| date=2005-02-03 }}</ref>

T'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the "Trial of the Panther" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa’s life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.

To save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like [[Adamantium]] claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular "favorite son", and he implores M'Baku to return.

Fury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the [[Ultimates]]. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T'Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.<ref>''Ultimate Captain America Annual'' #1 (Dec. 2008), written by [[Jeph Loeb]]: Chapters "Favorite Son" and "Training Day"</ref>

He rejoins the team in the episode "Behold...The Vision!" after a battle with [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. He was thought dead in the episode "Operation Galactic Storm" when he drove a Kree ship into the sun. However, just as the ship is about to crash, Panther uses its teleporter to take him to a Kree ship on the other side of the wormhole. On the Kree ship, he steals a smaller ship, and follows the Avengers down to Hala. Panther rescued Iron Man, Vision, Hawkeye, and Thor from a monster, and helped them free the others. He then travels back to Earth with them.
