The '''Black Panther''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #52.  He was one of the first major non-[[caricature]]d black comic book characters, and was the first major black superhero.  His name predates the use of the term by the [[Black Panther Party]].

The Black Panther is the title given to the ruler of the fictional [[Africa]]n nation of '''Wakanda''' and to the chief of the various tribes that comprise the nation's population.  The costume worn is a symbol of office and is used even during diplomatic missions.  The Black Panther is entitled to the use of a heart-shaped herb that grants the person who consumes it enhanced strength, agility, and perception.  The current bearer of the Black Panther mantle is '''T'Challa''', who has had a lengthy career as a superhero, including a long-standing membership in [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].

T'Challa is the son of T'Chaka, who was the Black Panther before him.  At some point in the distant past, a massive [[meteorite]] comprised of the sound-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was only recently unearthed.  Knowing that other, more powerful nations would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka concealed Wakanda from the outside world.  He would sell off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending Wakanda's best scholars to university abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the most technologically advanced nations in the world.  However, eventually the explorer [[Klaw|Ulysses Klaw]] found his way to Wakanda, and using lies and subterfuge covered up his work on a vibranium-powered sound-based weapon.  When he was exposed, Klaw killed T'Chaka and many other Wakandans, only for his "sound blaster" to be turned on him by a grieving T'Challa, who was then barely a teenager.  Klaw's right hand was destroyed by the overloaded sonic weapon, and he and his men fled.

T'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the tribes of Wakanda.  He would then go on to study abroad in [[New York City]] before returning to his kingship.  T'Challa revealed himself to the Fantastic Four, defeating them in individual combat before teaming up with them to battle the returning Klaw, who would soon return as a being made entirely of living sound.  T'Challa went on to become romantically involved with the American singer Monica Lynne and to begin a long association with the Avengers.  The role of Black Panther briefly fell into the hands of T'Challa's rival Erik Killmonger when he defeated T'Challa in ritual combat, only for Killmonger to die upon eating the heart-shaped herb.

The Black Panther had his first starring role in the pages of ''[[Jungle Action]]''.  That series was eventually replaced with the first ''Black Panther'' series, which was written and illustrated by Jack Kirby.  He appeared in two subsequent miniseries in the [[1980s]] before being revamped by [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Christopher Priest]] and [[Mark Texeira]] in the award-winning ''Black Panther'' ongoing series in the "[[Marvel Knights]]" imprint, which was eventually restarted as ''[[The Crew]]'' before being cancelled due to low sales.  In February [[2005]], a new ''Black Panther'' series will be published under Marvel Comics, written by filmmaker [[Reginald Hudlin]] and drawn by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]]
