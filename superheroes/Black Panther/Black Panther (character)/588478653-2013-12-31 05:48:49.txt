The '''Black Panther''' ('''T'Challa''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and penciller-co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], he [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #52 (July 1966). He is the first [[Black people|black]] [[superhero]] in mainstream American comics,<!--Note: He is not African nor American--> debuting several years before such early [[African-American]] superheroes as Marvel Comics' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Luke Cage]], and [[DC Comics]]' [[Tyroc]], [[Black Lightning]] and [[Green Lantern]] [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]].

==Concept and creation==

===Name===
The Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|Black Panthers]] Tank Battalion.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183 |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |author= Cronin, Brian |date= December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |work= H.K. Yuen Social Movement Archive }}</ref> He is the first Black <!--rather than "African" since Western Lobo is not African but African-American; "Black" is capitalized per AP Stylebook--> superhero in mainstream [[comic book]]s; virtually no Black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution ''[[All-Negro Comics]]'' #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title ''[[Jungle Tales]]'', from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]; and the [[Dell Comics]] [[Western comics|Western]] character [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], the first Black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-[[caricature]]d Black supporting characters in comics include [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[infantry]] private [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]] of ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]''.

===Publication history<!--subhead per WikiProject Comics style-->===
Following his debut in ''Fantastic Four'' #52-53 (July-Aug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967) and with [[Captain America]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #97-99 (Jan.-March 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] to [[New York City]], [[New York]] to join the titular American superhero team in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'',<!--Note to researchers--#s 52, 69, 92; 56 was a cameo, and 99 was with Avengers, as were his ''Hulk'' and ''Sub-Mariner'' appearances--> and fought [[Doctor Doom]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6-7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that [[supervillain]]'s short-lived starring feature. He later returned in a guest-appearance capacity in ''Fantastic Four'' #119 (Feb. 1972) during which he briefly tried using the name '''Black Leopard''' to avoid connotations invoking the Black-militant [[political party]] the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]].<ref>When Fantastic Four member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] asked about the name change, T'Challa responded, "I contemplate a return to ''your'' country, Ben Grimm, where the latter term has —''political'' connotations. I neither condemn nor condone those who have taken up the name, but ''T'Challa'' is a law unto ''himself''. Hence, the ''new'' name—a ''minor'' point, at best, since the panther ''is'' a leopard."</ref>

He received his first starring feature with ''Jungle Action'' #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in ''The Avengers'' #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by [[Don McGregor]], with art by [[pencilers]] [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gil Kane]], and [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]], and which gave inkers [[Klaus Janson]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]] some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed<ref name=dmd>{{cite web|authorlink=Dwayne McDuffie| last=McDuffie|first= Dwayne|url=http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/TBC3.html |title=To Be Continued|publisher= (column #3), Dwayne McDuffie official site|date=undated|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5npmJ5djk | archivedate= February 26, 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}</ref> series ran in ''Jungle Action'' #6-24 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1976).<ref name=gcd2>[http://www.comics.org/series/2053/ ''Jungle Action'', Marvel, 1973 Series], at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

One now-common innovation McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.<ref name="sacks">{{cite web|last=Sacks|first=Jason|url=http://www.fanboyplanet.com/comics/js-panthersrage.php |title=Panther's Rage: Marvel's First Graphic Novel|publisher=FanboyPlanet.com| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704142442/http://www.fanboyplanet.com/comics/js-panthersrage.php | archivedate= July 4, 2008}} Additional [http://www.webcitation.org/5nplRLNpI WebCitation archive].</ref> The first, "Panther's Rage", ran through the first 13 issues, initially as 13- to 15-page stories. Starting with ''Jungle Action'' #14, they were expanded to 18- to 19-page stories; there was additionally a 17-page epilogue. Two decades later, writer [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Christopher Priest]]'s 1998 series ''The Black Panther'' utilized [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Venomm]], <!--sp OK--> and other characters introduced in this arc.

Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc "Marvel's first [[graphic novel]]":
{{bquote|[T]here were real character arcs in [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] [comics] over time. But ... 'Panther's Rage' is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of ''Jungle Action'' (#s 6 through 18), 'Panther's Rage' is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.<ref name="sacks" />}}

The second and final arc, "Panther vs. the Klan", ran as mostly 17-page stories in ''Jungle Action'' #19-24 (Jan.-Nov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.<ref name=gcd2 /> The subject matter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.<ref>McGregor, Don. "Panther's Chronicles" (introduction), ''Marvel Masterworks: The Black Panther Vol. 1'' (Marvel Worldwide, 2010), pp. xii-xii (unnumbered).</ref> The arc ended mid-story and ''Jungle Action'' folded, with [[Jack Kirby]]—newly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival [[DC Comics]] for a time—immediately writing and drawing the new series ''Black Panther'', which ran 15 issues (Jan. 1977 - May 1979).<ref name=gcdbp>[http://www.comics.org/series/2387/ ''Black Panther'', Marvel, 1977 Series] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

African-American writer-editor [[Dwayne McDuffie]] said of the ''Jungle Action'' "Black Panther" feature:
{{bquote|This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.<ref name=dmd />}}

Writer [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]'s and penciller [[Mark Texeira]]'s 1998 series ''The Black Panther'' vol. 3 utilized [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Venomm]],<!--spelled correctly with double M--> and other characters introduced in "Panther's Rage", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross, the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter, and Panther's protégé, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. "I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to," adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.<ref>{{Cite news| author=Ethan Sacks| url= | title=The unsung heroes: Blade & Co. help to close racial divide| publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]]| date=2002-03-19 }}</ref>

The last 13 issues (#50-62) saw the main character replaced by a [[multiracial]] [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officer]] named [[Kasper Cole]], with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], was placed in the series ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]'', running concurrently with the final few ''Black Panther'' issues. ''The Crew'' was canceled with issue #7.

==Fictional character biography==
{{In-universe|section|date=July 2010}}

===Early life and background===
[[File:Avengers52.jpg|thumb|left|Cover detail, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968): Debut of the short-lived cowl mask. Art by [[John Buscema]]]]
The Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one still must earn it.

In the distant past, a [[meteorite]] made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler at the time, King T'Chaka, like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife, T'Challa's birth mother N'Yami, died while in labor with T'Challa, so T'Challa would be raised by his father and his father's second wife Ramonda, at least until T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]]. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on him, gravely injuring him and forcing him to flee. Around the same time, his stepmother Ramonda visited her old home in [[South Africa]]. While on this trip she was kidnapped and taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius (T'Challa would not learn of this until years later).

T'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan, T'Chaka's younger brother, successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan [[walkabout]] [[rite of passage]], T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the [[X-Men]] member Storm.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (Dec. 1980), revised in ''Storm'' vol. 2, #1-6 (2006)</ref> The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.

T'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zeraze—the Wakandan [[secret police]]—and its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf. Later, to keep peace, he picked ''dora milaje'' ("adored ones") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time <!--Under "Powers & abilities, it says his Ph.D. is from Oxford University, in Oxford, England. Here the phrase says: in [[New York City]]--> before returning to his kingship. T'Challa next invited the American superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]] to Wakanda, then attacked and neutralized them individually in order to prove himself worthy as his people's defender and to test the team to see if it could be an effective ally against Klaw, who had become a [[supervillain]] made of living sound.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #52-53 (July-Aug. 1966)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-262/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 262 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=September 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 29, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> After the ruler made proper amends to the superhero team, the four befriended and helped T'Challa, and he in turn aided the heroes against the supervillain the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967)</ref>

T'Challa later joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''The Avengers'' #52 (May 1968)</ref> beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battled the [[Man-Ape]] while with the group,<ref>''Avengers'' #62 (March 1969)</ref> and then met the American singer Monica Lynne,<ref>''The Avengers'' #73 (Feb. 1970)</ref> with whom he became romantically involved. He helped the Avengers defeat the second [[Sons of the Serpent]], and then revealed his true identity on American television.<ref>''The Avengers'' #74 (March 1970)</ref> He encountered Daredevil, and revealed to him that he had deduced Daredevil's secret identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #69 (Oct. 1970)</ref>

===Return to Wakanda===
The Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of Civil War, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper [[Erik Killmonger]] and his minions,<ref>''[[Jungle Action]]'' #6-18 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1975)</ref> the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref>''Jungle Action'' #19-22 & 24 (Jan.-July & Nov. 1976)</ref> He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s Frogs.<ref>Story arc beginning ''Black Panther'' #1 (Jan. 1977)</ref> These produced an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, [[telepathy|telepathic]] Panther with a terminal [[cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]], whom T'Challa placed in cryogenic stasis.

Later, while searching for and finding his mother, the Panther contends with [[South Africa]]n authorities during [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]].<ref>The omnibus series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #13-37 (Late Feb. - 1December [week 2] 1989)</ref> T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #1-4 (May-Oct. 1991)</ref> though the couple never married.

Years later, the Panther accepts a [[Washington, D.C.]] envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats, often fighting side by side (or attempting to). In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first main threat to Wakandan sovereignty he and Ross encounter is 'Xcon'—an alliance of rogue intelligence agents—backs a coup led by the sorcerer Reverend Achebe. Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to [[nationalization|nationalize]] foreign companies. Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther, but falls into a [[coma]] upon eating the Heart-Shaped Herb—poisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects. T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.

Later, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.

===Marriage and superhero Civil War===

T'Challa then helps [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]] (alias Storm), with whom he had a brief romance during his teens,<ref>''Black Panther'' #24 (December 2006)</ref> reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.{{issue|date=November 2012}} He shortly afterward proposes,{{issue|date=November 2012}} and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.{{issue|date=November 2012}} However, he failed to reunite both Captain America and [[Iron Man]] because of their opposing views on the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #18</ref>

===Passing the mantle===
Upon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from [[Monica Rambeau]] (a.k.a. Pulsar).<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #35-37</ref> Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the [[Skrulls]], who had infiltrated as part of their "[[Secret Invasion]]" plan to conquer Earth.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #38-41</ref> Prince [[Namor]], the Sub-Mariner, attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains.

After he was tricked and ambushed by Doom and the passing of the Panther mantle, T'Challa lost all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he has been working with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #8</ref> He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5, #9-10">''Black Panther'' vol. 5, #9-10</ref> which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.<ref>''Doomwar'' #5</ref>

===The Man Without Fear===
{{Plot|section|date=October 2011}}
After the events of [[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] (the costumed adventurer, Daredevil) asked T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, giving T'Challa a chance to discover himself.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle">{{Cite book|title=Black Panther: The Man Without Fear ''Urban Jungle'' |first=David |last=Liss |isbn=978-0-7851-4523-3 |year=2011}}</ref>

With the help of [[Foggy Nelson]], T'Challa assumed the identity of '''Mr. Okonkwo''', an immigrant from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Congo]] and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen. He chose this identity so that he could blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man, like Murdock did as a lawyer. He learned quickly and got on well with two of the Kitchen's staff—Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also got to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block—Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

T'Challa soon found himself up against an ambitious new crime lord—an ethnic Romanian, Vlad Dinu, who styled himself "The Impaler". He also sought an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. Luke Cage and Spider-Man kept an eye on T'Challa and helped despite the latter's rejection of their assistance. Meanwhile, a serial-killer ran loose seemingly to target victims at random.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

Vlad turned out to be a survivor of an earlier Romanian program which sought to produce their own super-soldier. Feigning the treatment he received failed, Vlad managed to escape to USA and became a henchman of the Kingpin. He successfully kept a low profile while observing Wilson Fisk in his dealings, and vowed not to make the same mistakes. Vlad had his own powers which allowed him to transmute matter into energy briefly. He also successfully created a facade of a well-to-do businessman residing in [[Greenwich Village]] with his older son Nicolae from his deceased Romanian wife, and Gabe from a beautiful American wife, Angela.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, as T'Challa came to be known in his new disguise, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen was seriously injured after suffering an energy blast from Vlad, and was shortly reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther became more intense and personal, especially after Vlad arrived home and discovered the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

It was revealed in the end that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of children - Gabe was apparently abused secretly by Angela. Brian was actually still alive and kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

The Panther managed to obtain evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turned the evidence over to Kurtz. In the final showdown, Vlad killed his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe had injected the serum on himself but was too new to his powers and was arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe revealed to the Panther Brian's fate.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

Despite being aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promised to keep silent. In the epilogue, Dr. Holman was shown hiring [[Kraven the Hunter]] to hunt down Brian to avoid exposure of her culpability.<ref name="TMWF-Urban Jungle"/>

===Wakanda Again===
Shortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608">Fantastic Four #608</ref> Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #8</ref> Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her he has annulled their marriage.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The title "Black Panther" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special Heart-Shaped Herb which, in addition to his mystical connection with the Wakandan Panther God, grants him superhumanly acute senses and increases his strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, and agility to [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-levels. He has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.<ref name="Black Panther vol. 5, #9-10"/> His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/> 

As king of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, as well as the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred [[vibranium]] costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.

He is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and [[scientist]]. He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Physics]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. Considered one of the eight smartest people on the planet,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #601</ref> he is a genius in physics and advanced technology, and is a brilliant inventor. He also has been granted the knowledge of every past Black Panther.<ref name="Fantastic Four #608"/>

T'Challa is a rigorously trained gymnast and acrobat and is a master in various African martial arts as well as contemporary martial arts and fighting styles that belong to no known disciplines.

In Volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an "energy dagger", a [[vibranium]]-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the "Kimoyo card." In Volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as "thrice-blessed armor" and "light armor" for specific tasks, and for a short while outfitted him with the [[Ebony Blade]] of the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].

==Reception==
Black Panther was ranked the 71st greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 | title=Wizard's top 200 characters. External link consists of a forum site summing up the top 200 characters of Wizard Magazine since the real site that contains the list is broken. | publisher=[[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]]. | accessdate=May 17, 2011}}</ref> [[IGN]] also ranked the Black Panther as the 51st greatest comic book hero stating that Black Panther could be called Marvel's [[Batman]]. Not because they have the same silhouette, but because he too is a man of immense resources and a fierce will that pushes him to be the best at what he does; IGN also stated that readers are reminded that T'Challa is a hero and a force to be reckoned with regardless of his technology and resources.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/51 | title=Black Panther is number 51 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 17, 2011}}</ref> 

===Volume 3===
Journalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer "turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it". Gross applauded the title's "endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels".<ref>{{Cite news| author=Joe Gross and Jeff Salamon | url= | title=Five comic books you (or your kids)* should be reading | publisher=[[Austin American-Statesman]] | date=2002-05-30 }}</ref>

Comics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. "Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the ''Spider-Man'' comics, I want to like ''Black Panther'', but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?"<ref>{{Cite news| author=Mike Sangiacomo | url= | title=Tips on what to buy, avoid with budget in mind | work=[[The Plain Dealer]] | date=2000-04-01 }}</ref>

Reporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. "I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching '[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]' in rewind. My head is exploding.'"<ref>{{Cite news| author=Bill Radford| url= | title=Marvel Knights books put new spin on classic heroes| publisher=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]] | date=1998-11-05 }}</ref>

===Volume 4===
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave a negative review to the first arc, "Who Is The Black Panther?", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, "Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing".<ref>{{Cite news| url= | title=Black Panther: Who Is the Black Panther?| work=[[Publishers Weekly]]| date=2005-10-17 }}</ref>

Journalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a "fairly unimpressive launch". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. "He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough".<ref>{{Cite news| author=Shawn Jeffords | url= | title=Is the Black Panther back?| publisher=[[Sarnia Observer]]| date=2005-02-03 }}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-reality]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint]], the Black Panther is '''T'Challa Udaku''', a mutant who is experimented on in [[Weapon X]] program of [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #5</ref>

T'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the "Trial of the Panther" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother [[Man-Ape|M'Baku]] finds T'Challa bloodied and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa’s life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.

To save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like [[Adamantium]] claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D. now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently contacts M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular "favorite son", and he implores M'Baku to return.

Fury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the [[Ultimates]]. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T'Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.<ref>''Ultimate Captain America Annual'' #1 (Dec. 2008), written by [[Jeph Loeb]]: Chapters "Favorite Son" and "Training Day"</ref>
