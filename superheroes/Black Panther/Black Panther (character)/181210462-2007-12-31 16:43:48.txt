The '''Black Panther''' ('''T'Challa''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is the first modern [[Black people|Black]] <!--Note: He is African, not African-American--> [[superhero]]. Created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciller]]-co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], he [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #52 (July 1966). Although there have been numerous men who have used the Black Panther identity during the history of the Marvel Universe, this article refers solely to the modern-day Black Panther, also known by his birth name, T'Challa.

The Black Panther, whose name predates the use of the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], is not the first Black <!--rather than "African" since Western Lobo is not African but African-American; "Black" is capitalized per AP Stylebook-->hero in mainstream comic books. That distinction is split between Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the multiple-character omnibus series ''[[Jungle Tales]]'', from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]; and the [[Dell Comics]] [[Western fiction|Western]] character [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], the first Black and the first character of [[Africa]]n descent to star in his own comic book. Previous non-[[caricature]]d Black supporting characters in comics include ''Daily Bugle'' managing editor [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|Joe Robertson]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[infantry]] private [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]] of ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]''.

==Publication history<!--subhead per WikiProject Comics style-->==
Following his debut in ''Fantastic Four'' #52-53 (July-Aug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967) and with [[Captain America]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #97-99 (Jan.-March 1968), the Black Panther sojourned from the fictional [[African]] nation of [[Wakanda]] to [[New York City]], [[New York]] to join the titular [[United States|American]] [[superhero]] team in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comics for the next few years — including a few issues during which he briefly tried the name '''Black Leopard''' to avoid connotations invoking the Black-militant [[political party]] the [[Black Panthers]]. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'',<!--Note to researchers--#s 52, 69, 92; 56 was a cameo, and 99 was with Avengers, as were his ''Hulk'' and ''Sub-Mariner'' appearances--> and fought [[Doctor Doom]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6-7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that [[supervillain]]'s short-lived starring feature. He reunited with his original superhero comrades in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #119 (Feb. 1972).

The Black Panther's first starring series was in ''[[Jungle Action]]'' vol. 2, #6-24 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1976), [[writer|written]] by [[Don McGregor]] with art by [[penciller]]s [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gil Kane]], and [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]]. One now-common innovation it pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.
[[Image:Fantasticfour52.jpg|thumb|left|''Fantastic Four'' #52 (July 1966), the Black Panther's debut. Art by [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
McGregor's first arc, "Panther's Rage", ran from ''Jungle Action'' vol. 2, #6 (Sept. 1973) through #18 (Nov. 1975). A second arc, "Panther vs. the Klan", was truncated when the series was canceled with issue #24. ''Jungle Action'' #5 and #23 reprinted, respectively, ''The Avengers'' #62 (March 1969), which featured the Black Panther, and ''Daredevil'' #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Panther guest-starred.

Immediately following the initial series was ''Black Panther'', written and illustrated by Jack Kirby for 12 of its 15 issues (Jan. 1977 - March 1979), with a corresponding shift in tone from McGregor's lyrical [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] to Kirby's trademark high adventure. A four-issue [[miniseries]], also titled ''Black Panther'', appeared in 1988, written by [[Peter B. Gillis]] and pencilled by [[Denys Cowan]].

McGregor revisited his Panther saga with [[Gene Colan]] in "Panther's Quest", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly [[anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' (issues #13-37, Feb.-Dec. 1989). He later teamed with artist [[Dwayne Turner]] in the square-bound miniseries ''Panther's Prey'' (Sept. 1990 - March 1991).

Writer [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Christopher Priest]]'s and penciller [[Mark Texeira]]'s 1998 series ''The Black Panther'' utilized [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Venomm]],<!--spelled correctly with double M--> and other characters introduced in "Panther's Rage", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross, the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter, and Panther's protégé, Queen Divine Justice.  The Priest-Texeira series, which was under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint its first year, earned critical plaudits,{{Fact|date=September 2007}} but sales of the comic were never high.

The last 13 issues (#50-62) saw the main character replaced by an [[African American]] [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officer]] named [[Kasper Cole]], with T'Challa relegated to a background character. This Black Panther, who became the [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], was placed in the series ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]'', running concurrently with the final few ''Black Panther'' issues. ''The Crew'' was canceled with issue #7.

In February 2005, Marvel began publishing a new ongoing ''Black Panther'' series, written by filmmaker [[Reginald Hudlin]] and penciled by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and background===
The Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]]. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther uniform is a symbol of office and is used even during diplomatic missions.

The Black Panther is entitled to the use of a heart-shaped herb that grants the person who consumes it enhanced strength, agility, and perception. The present-day bearer of the Black Panther mantle is T'Challa, who has had a lengthy career as a superhero, including a longstanding membership in [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]. For a brief time upon joining the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #52-55, May-Aug. 1968)</ref> the Black Panther wore a cowled half-mask, similar to that of [[Batman]]. In stories published in the 2000s, it came to light that the Panther originally joined the Avengers with the intention of spying on them. This drove a temporary wedge between T'Challa and his teammates.

T'Challa is the son of '''T'Chaka''', who was the Black Panther before him. In the distant past, a massive [[meteorite]] comprised of the sound-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed a generation before the events of the present day. Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka concealed his country from the outside world. He would sell off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country's best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer [[Klaw|Ulysses Klaw]] found his way to Wakanda to covertly create a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaw killed T'Chaka and other Wakandans, only to see his "sound blaster" turned on him by a grieving T'Challa, then barely a teenager. Klaw's right hand was destroyed, and he and his men fled.

During his youth, T'Challa also met and fell in love with apparent orphaned child [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the [[X-Men]] member Storm; the two broke up over T'Challa's need to avenge his father's death.

T'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zeraze — the Wakandan [[secret police]] — and its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf; later, to keep the peace, he picked "dora milaje" ("adored ones") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad <!--Under "Powers & abilities, it says his Ph.D. is from Oxford University, in Oxford, England. Here the phrase says: in [[New York City]]--> before returning to his kingship. To prove himself worthy as the defender of his people, T'Challa attacked the [[Fantastic Four]], also wishing to test the team and see if they could be as valuable allies against Klaw as he hoped they could be. He more than held his own against each member in individual combat, before being cornered by the assembled Fantastic Four. He then revealed his reasons to the team.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #52</ref>

After making up to the team with a sumptuous welcome, he persuaded the Fantastic Four to help him battle the returning Klaw, who had become a being made entirely of living sound.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #53</ref> T'Challa next aided the heroes against the [[supervillain]] the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967)</ref>

T'Challa later joined the superhero team the Avengers,<ref>''The Avengers'' #52</ref> beginning a long association with the team. He first battled the [[Man-Ape]] while with the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #61</ref> and then met the American singer Monica Lynne,<ref>''The Avengers'' #73</ref> with whom he became romantically involved. He helped the Avengers defeat the second [[Sons of the Serpent]], and then revealed his true identity on American television.<ref>''The Avengers'' #74</ref> He encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and revealed to him that he had deduced Daredevil's secret identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #69</ref>

===Return to Wakanda===
[[Image:blackpanther1.jpg|thumb|left|Black Panther: The Client TPB.<br>Art by [[Mark Texeira]].]]
The Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper [[Erik Killmonger]] and his minions,<ref>''[[Jungle Action]]'' #6-17</ref> the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and Dragon Circle.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #19-24; ''Marvel Premiere'' #51-53</ref> He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s Frogs.<ref>''Black Panther'' #12-13</ref> These produced an alternate version of T'Challa from a future ten years hence, a merry, [[telepathy|telepathic]] Panther with a terminal [[cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]], whom T'Challa placed in cryogenic stasis.

Sometime later, [[Iron Man]] aids the Panther in defeating Killmonger.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #5</ref> Then, while searching for and finding his mother, the Panther contends with [[South Africa]]n authorities during [[Apartheid]].<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #13-37</ref> T'Challa eventually proposes becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #1-4</ref> though the couple never married.

Years later, the Panther accepts a [[Washington, D.C.]] envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. First Xcon — an alliance of rogue intelligence agents — backs a coup led by the sorcerer Reverend Achebe. Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to [[nationalization|nationalise]] foreign companies.  Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther, but falls into a [[coma]] upon eating the heart-shaped herb — poisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects. T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.

Later, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.

===Marriage and superhero Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comic book)}}
[[Image:Stormbpmarriage.PNG|The marriage of Storm and the Black Panther: Promotional art for ''Black Panther'' #18 cover (Sept. 2006) by [[Frank Cho]].|thumb]]
T'Challa then helps [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], with whom he had a brief romance during his teens, reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S. He shortly afterward proposes, and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.

One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the [[Inhumans]], [[Doctor Doom]], the [[President of the United States]], and [[Namor]], with only that last ending well. After the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]], the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces. During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan [[embassy]] in [[Manhattan]] is heavily damaged, and the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing [[Fantastic Four]] members [[Reed Richards|Reed]] and [[Sue Richards]].

==Powers and abilities==
The title "Black Panther" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special heart-shaped herb, as well as his mystical connection with the Wakandan Panther God, that grants him superhumanly acute senses (especially eyesight, night vision, and sense of smell) and increases his strength, speed, stamina, and agility to the peak of human development. T'Challa is a rigorously trained gymnast and acrobat, proficient in various African martial arts as well as contemporary ones and fighting styles that belong to no known disciplines. He is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, and [[scientist]] — he has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[physics]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. He is a genius in physics and advanced technology, and is a brilliant inventor. His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. 

As king of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, as well as the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.

In Volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an "energy dagger", a [[vibranium]]-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the "Kimoyo card."  In Volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as "thrice-blessed armor" and "light armor" for specific tasks, and also outfitted him with the [[Ebony Blade]].

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate universe of ''[[Earth X]]'', T'Challa has been affected by the mutative event that drives the plot. Like most of humanity, he is mutated; in this case to become a humanoid black panther. He is entrusted with the [[Cosmic Cube]] by [[Captain America]], who knows that T'Challa would be the only one to resist using it and to never give it back if asked. In fact, Captain America does ask for it back and T'Challa is forced to refuse. 

===Fox Kids===
The Black Panther appears in issues #1 and #6-7 of Marvel Comics/[[Fox Kids]] comic-book series based on the [[TV show]] ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]''.

===Marvel Zombies===
Black Panther is one of the few uninfected superheroes in the alternate-universe series ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', where he is kept as a food supply for the Zombie [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]]. Despite having lost most of his right arm and left leg, the Black Panther escapes with the aid of the head of [[Wasp (comics)#Marvel Zombies|the Wasp]], joining forces with the mutant group the [[Acolytes (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Acolytes]]. Many years later, an older T'Challa is fatally wounded in his sleep by an agent of the Acolytes, as a civil war is unfolding in New Wakanda between the militaristic Acolytes and the more peaceful Black Panther's followers. Wasp is forced to zombify him, reasoning that some week of isolation could be enough to beat their "hunger".

===Mangaverse===
T'challa appears in the Marvel Mangaverse as a man, with a pet panther. When summoning the spirits, T'challa and his panther combine to become the Black Panther. He also became The Falcon. This Black Panther was romantically attracted to [[Tigra]] .

===Ultimate Panther===
The Black Panther appears on the wraparound cover of the alternate-universe [[Ultimate Marvel]] series ''Ultimates 3''.<ref>[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/808/808189p1.html IGN.com UK (July 26, 2007): "Exclusive: ''Ultimates 3'' Debut Part Two", by Richard George]</ref>. He is shown briefly in the first issue, but not much is known about him except for the fact that Captain America vouched for his inclusion into the team.

==Quotes==
*'''[[Dwayne McDuffie]]''' on the 1970s "Black Panther" series : "This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it (and where's that [[trade paperback]] collection, Marvel?), sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don McGregor and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/TBC3.html Dwayne McDuffie official site: "To Be Continued" #3 (column; no date)]</ref>
