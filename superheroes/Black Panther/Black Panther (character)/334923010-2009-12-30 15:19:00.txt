The '''Black Panther''' ('''T'Challa''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and penciller-co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], he [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #52 (July 1966). He is the first [[Black people|black]] [[superhero]] in mainstream American comics,<!--Note: He is not African nor American--> debuting several years before such early [[African-American]] superheroes as the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Tyroc]], [[Black Lightning]] or the [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] [[Green Lantern]].

Although there have been numerous men who have used the Black Panther identity during the history of the Marvel Universe, this article refers primarily to the modern-day Black Panther, also known by his birth name, T'Challa.

==Concept and creation==
===Name===
The Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|Black Panthers]] Tank Battalion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183 |accessdate=13 December 2008 |author= Cronin, Brian |date= 05 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |accessdate=13 December 2008 |work= H.K. Yuen Social Movement Archive }}</ref> He is not the first Black <!--rather than "African" since Western Lobo is not African but African-American; "Black" is capitalized per AP Stylebook-->hero in mainstream [[comic book]]s; that distinction is split between Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus series ''[[Jungle Tales]]'', from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], and the [[Dell Comics]] [[Western fiction|Western]] character [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], the first [[Black man]] to star in his own comic book. Previous non-[[caricature]]d Black supporting characters in comics include ''Daily Bugle'' managing editor [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|Joe Robertson]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[infantry]] private [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel Jones]] of ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]''.

===Publication history<!--subhead per WikiProject Comics style-->===
Following his debut in ''Fantastic Four'' #52-53 (July-Aug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967) and with [[Captain America]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #97-99 (Jan.-March 1968), the Black Panther sojourned from the fictional [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]] to [[New York City]], [[New York]] to join the titular American superhero team in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years.  During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'',<!--Note to researchers--#s 52, 69, 92; 56 was a cameo, and 99 was with Avengers, as were his ''Hulk'' and ''Sub-Mariner'' appearances--> and fought [[Doctor Doom]] in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6-7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that [[supervillain]]'s short-lived starring feature.  He later returned in a guest-appearance capacity in ''Fantastic Four'' #119 (Feb. 1972) during which he briefly tried the name '''Black Leopard''' to avoid connotations invoking the Black-militant [[political party]] the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]].  When the Thing asked about the name change, he responded "I contemplate a return to ''your'' country, Ben Grimm, where the latter term has -- ''political'' connotations. I neither condemn nor condone those who have taken up the name, but ''T'Challa'' is a law unto ''himself''. Hence, the ''new'' name --a ''minor'' point, at best, since the panther ''is'' a leopard."

The Black Panther's first starring series was in ''[[Jungle Action]]'' vol. 2, #6-24 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1976), [[writer|written]] by [[Don McGregor]] with art by [[penciller]]s [[Rich Buckler]], [[Gil Kane]], and [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]]. One now-common innovation it pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.

[[Image:Fantasticfour52.jpg|thumb|left|''Fantastic Four'' #52 (July 1966), the Black Panther's debut. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Joe Sinnott]].]]

McGregor's first arc, "Panther's Rage", ran in ''Jungle Action'' vol. 2, #6-18 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1975). A second arc, "Panther vs. the Klan", was truncated when the series was canceled with issue #24. ''Jungle Action'' #5 and #23 reprinted, respectively, ''The Avengers'' #62 (March 1969), which featured the Black Panther, and ''Daredevil'' #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Panther guest-starred.

Immediately following the initial series came the first volume of ''Black Panther'' written and illustrated by Jack Kirby for 12 of its 15 issues (Jan. 1977 - March 1979), with a corresponding shift in tone from McGregor's lyrical [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] to Kirby's trademark high adventure. Comics writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], co-founder of the black-oriented comics publisher [[Milestone Media]], said regarding the 1970s "Black Panther" series:
{{cquote|This overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it (and where's that [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collection, Marvel?), sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don McGregor and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/TBC3.html Dwayne McDuffie official site: "To Be Continued" #3 (column; no date)]</ref>}}

The four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Black Panther'', appeared in 1988, written by [[Peter B. Gillis]] and penciled by [[Denys Cowan]].  McGregor revisited his Panther saga with [[Gene Colan]] in "Panther's Quest", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly [[anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' (issues #13-37, Feb.-Dec. 1989). He later teamed with artist [[Dwayne Turner]] in the square-bound miniseries ''Panther's Prey'' (Sept. 1990 - March 1991).

Writer [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]'s and penciller [[Mark Texeira]]'s 1998 series ''The Black Panther'' vol. 3 utilized [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Venomm]],<!--spelled correctly with double M--> and other characters introduced in "Panther's Rage", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross, the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter, and Panther's protégé, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series, which was under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint in its first year, earned critical plaudits,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} but sales of the comic were never high.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. "I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to," adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.<ref>{{cite news | author=Ethan Sacks| url= | title=The unsung heroes: Blade & Co. help to close racial divide| publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]]| date=2002-03-19 | accessdate=2008-06-12 }}</ref> 

The last 13 issues (#50-62) saw the main character replaced by an [[African American]] [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officer]] named [[Kasper Cole]], with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], was placed in the series ''[[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]'', running concurrently with the final few ''Black Panther'' issues. ''The Crew'' was canceled with issue #7.

In 2005, Marvel began publishing the ongoing series ''Black Panther'' vol. 4, initially written by filmmaker [[Reginald Hudlin]] (through issue #38) and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr.]] (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add "[[credibility|street cred]]" to the title, although he noted that the book is not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.<ref name="Reinvented">{{cite news | author=Misha Davenport| url= | title=A superhero reinvented for hip-hop generation| publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| date=2005-02-02 | accessdate=2008-06-12 }}</ref>  As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character [[Batman]], film director [[Spike Lee]], and music artist [[Sean Combs]].<ref name="Reinvented" /> This volume ran 41 issues (April 2005 - Nov. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and background===
The Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the [[Africa]]n nation of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]]. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther uniform is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions.
[[File:Avengers52.jpg|thumb|Cover detail, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #52 (May 1968): Debut of the short-lived cowl mask. Art by [[John Buscema]]]]
The Black Panther is entitled to the use of a heart-shaped herb that grants the person who consumes it enhanced strength, agility, and perception. The present-day bearer of the Black Panther mantle is '''T'Challa''', who has had a lengthy career as a superhero, including a longstanding membership in the Avengers. For a brief time upon joining the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #52-55, May-Aug. 1968)</ref> the Black Panther wore a cowled half-mask, similar to that of [[Batman]]. In stories published in the 2000s, it came to light that the Panther originally joined the Avengers with the intention of spying on them. This drove a temporary wedge between T'Challa and his teammates.

T'Challa is the son of '''T'Chaka''', who was the Black Panther before him. In the distant past, a massive [[meteorite]] made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka concealed his country from the outside world. He would sell off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country's best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer [[Klaw|Ulysses Klaw]] found his way to Wakanda to covertly create a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaw killed T'Chaka and other Wakandans, only to see his "sound blaster" turned on him by a grieving T'Challa, then barely a teenager. Klaw's right hand was destroyed, and he and his men fled.

During his youth, T'Challa also met and fell in love with apparent orphaned child [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the [[X-Men]] member Storm;<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 1 #100 (Dec. 1980), revised in ''Storm'' vol. 2 #1-6 (2006)</ref> the two broke up over T'Challa's need to avenge his father's death.

T'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zeraze — the Wakandan [[secret police]] — and its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf; later, to keep the peace, he picked ''dora milaje'' ("adored ones") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad <!--Under "Powers & abilities, it says his Ph.D. is from Oxford University, in Oxford, England. Here the phrase says: in [[New York City]]--> before returning to his kingship. T'Challa invited the American superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]] to Wakanda, then attacked and neutralized them individually in order to prove himself worthy as his people's defender and to test the team to see if it could be an effective ally against Klaw, who had become a being made of living sound.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #52-53 (July-August 1966)</ref> After the ruler made proper amends to the superhero team for the incident, they befriended and helped T'Challa, and he in turn aided the heroes against the [[supervillain]] the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (1967)</ref>

T'Challa later joined the Avengers,<ref>''The Avengers'' #52 (May 1968)</ref> beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battled the [[Man-Ape]] while with the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #62 (March 1969)</ref> and then met the American singer Monica Lynne,<ref>''The Avengers'' #73 (Feb. 1970)</ref> with whom he became romantically involved. He helped the Avengers defeat the second [[Sons of the Serpent]], and then revealed his true identity on American television.<ref>''The Avengers'' #74 (March 1970)</ref> He encountered Daredevil, and revealed to him that he had deduced Daredevil's secret identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #69 (October 1970)</ref>

===Return to Wakanda===
The Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper [[Erik Killmonger]] and his minions,<ref>''[[Jungle Action]]'' #6-18 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1975)</ref> the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref>''Jungle Action'' #19-22 & 24 (Jan.-July & Nov. 1976)</ref> He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s Frogs.<ref>Story arc beginning ''Black Panther'' #1 (Jan. 1977)</ref> These produced an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, [[telepathy|telepathic]] Panther with a terminal [[cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]], whom T'Challa placed in cryogenic stasis.

Later, while searching for and finding his mother, the Panther contends with [[South Africa]]n authorities during [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]].<ref>The omnibus series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #13-37 (Late Feb. - 1December [week 2] 1989)</ref> T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #1-4 (May-Oct. 1991)</ref> though the couple never married.

Years later, the Panther accepts a [[Washington, D.C.]] envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats, often fighting side by side (or attempting to). In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first main threat to Wakandan soveriengty he and Ross encounter is 'Xcon' — an alliance of rogue intelligence agents — backs a coup led by the sorcerer Reverend Achebe. Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to [[nationalization|nationalize]] foreign companies.  Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther, but falls into a [[coma]] upon eating the heart-shaped herb — poisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects. T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.

Later, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.

==Powers and abilities==
The title "Black Panther" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special heart-shaped herb, as well as his mystical connection with the Wakandan Panther god, that grants him superhumanly acute senses and increases his strength, speed, stamina, and agility to the peak of human development. His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones.  T'Challa is a rigorously trained gymnast and acrobat, proficient in various African martial arts as well as contemporary ones and fighting styles that belong to no known disciplines. He is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, and [[scientist]] — he has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[physics]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. Considered one of the 8 smartest people on the planet,<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #601</ref> he is a genius in physics and advanced technology, and is a brilliant inventor.  

As king of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, as well as the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.

In Volume 2, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an "energy dagger", a [[vibranium]]-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the "Kimoyo card."  In Volume 3, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as "thrice-blessed armor" and "light armor" for specific tasks, and also outfitted him with the [[Ebony Blade]], however the Ebony Blade was recently returned to the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] by T'Challa's wife, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Captain Britain and MI-13'' #10, Feb. 2009</ref>

==Reception==
===Volume 3===
Journalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer "turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it". Gross applauded the title's "endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels".<ref>{{cite news | author=Joe Gross and Jeff Salamon | url= | title=Five comic books you (or your kids)* should be reading | publisher=[[Austin American-Statesman]] | date=2002-05-30 | accessdate=2008-06-12 }}</ref> 

Comics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. "Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the ''Spider-Man'' comics, I want to like ''Black Panther'', but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?"<ref>{{cite news | author=Mike Sangiacomo | url= | title=Tips on what to buy, avoid with budget in mind | publisher=[[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)|The Plain Dealer]] | date=2000-04-01 | accessdate=2008-06-12 }}</ref> 

Reporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. "I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching '[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]' in rewind. My head is exploding.'"<ref>{{cite news | author=Bill Radford| url= | title=Marvel Knights books put new spin on classic heroes| publisher=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]] | date=1998-11-05 | accessdate=2008-06-12 }}</ref>

===Volume 4===
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave a negative review to the first arc, "Who Is The Black Panther?", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, "Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing".<ref>{{cite news | author= | url= | title=Black Panther: Who Is the Black Panther?| publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]| date=2005-10-17 | accessdate=2008-06-12 }}</ref> 

Journalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a "fairly unimpressive launch". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. "He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough".<ref>{{cite news | author=Shawn Jeffords | url= | title=Is the Black Panther back?| publisher=[[Sarnia Observer]]| date=2005-02-03 | accessdate=2008-06-12 }}</ref>

===Ultimate Black Panther===

A young African boy named '''T'Challa Udaku''', with metal spikes coming out of his knuckles like the Ultimate Black Panther, is a mutant being experimented on in [[Weapon X]] who is rescued by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], right before they destroy the facility.<ref>Ultimate Origins #5</ref>

In Ultimate Captain America Annual 01 (written by Jeph Loeb) the origins of the Black Panther are divulged in a two part story. The first entitled “Favorite Son” and the second “Training Day”.<ref name="Ultimate Captain America Annual #1">Ultimate Captain America Annual #1</ref>
 
T’Challa is the younger son of King T’Chaka of Wakanda. T’Challa is severely injured during the “Trial of the Panther” from which the protector of the nation is selected. The trial is to physically defeat an actual black panther in battle unarmed. T’Challa fails and is severely injured in his fight with the ferocious panther.
 
His older brother M’Baku, finds T’Challa bloodied and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Despite these statements, M'Baku tells their father that he does indeed love his brother. He is angry however that his father has decided to share Wakanda’s technology in exchange for America’s help in saving T’Challa’s life. It is stated that M'Baku left the kingdom shortly after this.

To save T’Challa, T'Chaka turned him over the Weapon X program. Over a year later a healed and healthy T’Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, is seen talking to a man, possibly a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist, who mentions that he has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like [[Adamantium]] claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. Despite all these enhancements, SHIELD claims they were unable to repair the damage the panther attack did to his vocal cords, thus leaving him a mute.

When King T’Chaka contacts Weapon X to check on the status of his son he learns from Nick Fury that they now have T’Challa and consider him an asset of the United States and S.H.I.E.L.D. T'Chaka is shocked and cries out that SHIELD's actions are "an outrage!"

Afterword, he writes M'Baku a letter, claiming that M’Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular "Favorite Son". He implores M'Baku to return, even going so far as to say that he could endure loosing T’Challa, but not M’Baku.
  
The second part of the book entitled “Training Day” opens with Captain America and Black Panther engaged in a violent sparing session at the Triskelion in which Black Panther holds his own against Captain America for an extended period of time. Despite Black Panther’s somewhat impressive skills after three hours Captain America is able to gain the upper hand at which point Nick Fury ends the session. The sparring session ends with Captain America saying "I'm better," in a two page spread with Captain America grinning over the Black Panther with his shield positioned at the Panther's throat. Fury reveals later that the reason he had the two spar was to see if Cap thought the Black Panther would be a good fit in the [[Ultimates]]. He also reveals that he believes that Black Panther can possibly be just as good as Cap himself if he would mentor him.
 
Captain America apparently agrees to train and mentor him and weeks later Black Panther displays his skills as he quickly dispatches a super powered criminal named [[Thunderball (comics)#Ultimate Thunderball|Thunderball]]. After the fight however Captain America confronts Black Panther’s apparent secrecy and silence. After a moment of contemplation Black Panther removes his mask for the first time in the presence of Captain America who is shocked to see the damage to his throat.

After returning to the Triskelion Cap confronts Fury and demands to know his past. Fury lies and tells Cap that Black Panther is a mutant like Wolverine. He also says that Black Panther probably received the scars on his throat from his father.
When Cap goes to get Black Panther for another training session he finds him on the Internet looking at articles about his father. Black Panther types on the computer that his father is a king and that he misses him. Cap then instructs him to give him the truth of whom he is and where he is from and who says he can’t return home. T’Challa types Fury.

A week later Cap tells Fury that Black Panther is ready to join the [[Ultimates]]. He takes him to [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Pym]] who now leads the [[Ultimates]] where Black Panther displays his athleticism, agility, and fighting abilities. Pym agrees to let Black Panther join the team. It is then revealed that Cap dons a mock Black Panther outfit with gloves armed with Adamintium claws designed by Tony Stark to fool Fury and the other members of the [[Ultimates]] and allow T’Challa to return home to Wakanda.
 
The two board a stealth helicopter and fly into Wakandan airspace. After Cap explains his rationale for helping T’Challa, the young man leaps from the helicopter and is last seen standing in front of the Wakanda kingdom.<ref name="Ultimate Captain America Annual #1"/>

Following this, Cap impersonates Black Panther during the [[Ultimate Marvel]] series ''[[Ultimates]] 3''. The truth is later revealed when the Juggernaut literally beats the black costume off of the Black Panther, revealing Steve Rogers underneath.<ref>Ultimates 3 #1-5</ref>
