The '''Foolkiller''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[vigilante]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and first appeared in the pages of [[1974]]'s ''[[Man-Thing]]''. He also had a ten-issue [[limited series]] that ran from [[1990]] to [[1991]]. There have been three different individuals to adopt the mantle of the Foolkiller.

==Foolkiller I (Ross G. Everbest) ==

The first Foolkiller was Ross G. Everbest. As a child, Everbest was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down. His father, a [[soldier]], and his mother, an army [[nurse]], were both killed during the [[Korean War]]. Everbest idolized his parents and was frustrated that he, himself, could not enter the service due to his paralysis, often falling into deep [[clinical depression|depression]]. One evening, Everbest's grandmother takes him to a travelling revival show starring "The Reverend Mike Pike," who cures Everbest's paralysis through [[faith healer|faith healing]]. As a result, he becomes the Reverend's proteg√© and a popular [[preacher]] in his own right during the revival tour.

As Everbest grew to adulthood during the late [[1960s]], he became increasingly concerned about what he saw as the deterioration of [[morality]] and [[decency]]. Everbest was particularly upset by the anti-[[Vietnam War]] protests and the counterculture movements. He interpreted these events as signs from the [[Devil]] and developed a [[philosophy]] that [[sin|sinners]], [[dissident]]s, and [[criminal]]s alike were "fools" who must be eliminated by an acting agent of [[God]]. He chooses himself to become this agent, the Foolkiller.

Everbest wants Reverend Mike to be the first to know of his plans, but choses an inopportune moment. He accidentally catches Mike in a hotel room, [[drunk]] and having an [[orgy]] with several young parishoners. Angry and hurt, Everbest kills Mike and preserves his body in [[formaldehyde]], as a shrine to the god-fearing man Mike had once been. Feeling that the financial success of the revival tour had corrupted his mentor, Everbest decides to use the remaining funds towards his Foolkiller mission, thus outfitting himself with a [[costume]] and trademark "purification gun," a [[pistol]] that [[disintegration|disintegrates]] its victims.

The Foolkiller embarks on a murder spree, killing [[biker]]s, [[hippie]]s, and [[Satanism|Satanists]]. He eventually goes to the [[Florida Everglades]], where he targets [[industrialist]] F.A. Shist, whose project would disrupt the [[ecology]] of that region. Everbest also targets [[Florida]] [[disk jockey]] Richard Rory, who has denounced the Foolkiller on [[radio]]. Cornering both men in the Everglades, the Foolkiller intended to execute both men in front of the glass tank containing Reverend Mike's body. The Man-Thing, sensing Everbest's violent intentions, intervenes and, after a brief struggle, the tank is accidentally shattered and Everbest is fatally impaled through heart by a shard of glass. The Foolkiller's body and equipment were impounded by Florida authorities.

== Foolkiller II (Greg Salinger) ==

Richard Rory later served jail time for a minor offence. During his brief incarceration, he befriends fellow inmate, Greg Salinger, with whom he shared his recent experiences. Rory was unaware of Salinger's mental instability as he told him the tale of the Foolkiller. Salinger, upon being released, steals the Foolkiller's equipment and undergoes a brief period of physical training. Some time later, Salinger, after killing serveral "fools" in [[New York]], tracks Rory down to thank him for inspiring his new purpose in life. One of the first "fools" that Salinger kills is the [[superhuman]], Blockbuster.

Salinger, who did not share Everbest's religious beliefs, decides that he can improve on the Foolkiller's mission by secularizing it. He felt that "fools" nurtured [[materialism]] and mediocrity. Thus, he defines ''fools'' as those who "lack a poetic nature". In keeping with his poetic theme, Greg Salinger's [[catch phrase]] as the Foolkiller becomes "Live a poem or die a fool!"

Rory, out of a sense of [[guilt]] and concern for his friend, feels that Salinger might get hurt or even killed if he was ever perceived as a dangerous "[[supervillain]]." With that in mind, he and fellow DJ, [[Dollar Bill (comics)|Dollar Bill]], hatch a plan to take Salinger to meet the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in the interest of joining them. Their real hope was that the Defenders would have heard of the Foolkiller and be able to peacefully subdue him. Salinger, however, has his own plans for the Defenders. Perceiving them as "fools" after their failure to capture the supervillain, [[Lunatik]], he goes along with Rory and Bill only to attack [[Valkyrie (comics)|Valkyrie]] and [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]] at first chance. The Defenders beat the outnumbered Salinger, but not before his purification gun set fire to the Defenders' headquarters. The defeated Salinger is loaded into an ambulance which accidentally runs off the road due to heavy rain. Salinger escapes and resumes his "Foolkilling" career.

Greg Salinger is seen again as a student at [[New York City]]'s Empire State University. At the time, graduate-student Peter Parker, ([[Spider-Man]]), is a [[teaching assistant]] at ESU. Parker befriends Salinger but, as Spider Man, eventually comes into conflict with the Foolkiller, who has appeared on campus killing a pair of [[FBI]] agents and attempts to kill the campus registrar. When a witness suggests that only a fool would fight Spider Man, Foolkiller attempts to shoot himself, but is prevented from doing so by Spider-Man. The court finds Salinger [[criminally insane]] and has him institutionalized in [[Indiana]].

Peter Parker's Spider-Sense usually gives him early warning of dangerous situations and persons, but he fails to sense that Greg Salinger is the Foolkiller. His Spider-Sense had triggered on two occasions in Salinger's presence but subsided while having a conversation with him each time. In both cases, Salinger was initially alone before encountering Parker, and Parker misinterpreted the danger as being directed at Salinger instead of coming from him. However, when he defeated and unmasked the Foolkiller in battle, he realized that Salinger's feelings of friendship towards Parker caused his [[psychopathic]] tendencies to subside. This was the reason why his Spider-Sense switched off when Salinger encountered him.

Years later, Greg Salinger is haunted by dreams of his life as the Foolkiller and feels the need to talk about it. He suggests to his therapist, Dr. Mears, that he would like to write about these feelings. With Mears' approval, Salinger is given access to a [[word processor]] with which he writes letters to various [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s. Meeting only with rejection, he decides to write to [[TV]] [[talk show]]s instead. The controversial Runyan Moody Show {{ref|Moody}} expresses interest in interviewing Salinger on site and the interview is televised nationwide. Among those watching the broadcast was Kurt Gerhardt.

== Foolkiller III (Kurt Gerhardt) ==

Kurt Gerhardt writes a letter to Salinger expressing his feelings of the world approaching a new age of [[barbarism]]. A year ago, his father was killed by [[mugger]]s who found only six dollars in his pocket. Apparently, they left the six dollars there as the killing alone was more fun. Gerhardt was then laid off from his job as a bank loan officer due to downsizing{{ref|S&L}}. This lead to divorce from his wife and unsuccessful job hunting until being forced to take work at a [[fast food restaurant]]. During his first week there, the restaurant was robbed and a fellow employee held at knifepoint. Gerhardt, still traumatized by his father's death, attacked the robbers only to be beaten bloody by them. It was during his recuperation at home that he saw the TV broadcast and decided to write to Salinger. Salinger, seeing potential in Gerhardt secretly calls him at his home and arranges to meet on an online [[BBS]] (Salinger had secretly found a way to access the modem on the computer that he was being allowed to use for writing purposes).

Using the secret BBS messages, Salinger directs Gerhardt to his old confidant, Merle Singer. We find out that Singer had been mutilated by an abusive boyfriend who threw [[acid]] into her face. This boyfriend was apparently killed by Salinger, who left the remainder of the acid in a vial in Singer's possession as a memento. Singer gives Gerhardt the Foolkiller costume and purification gun with the promise of help when he needed it.

Initially, Gerhardt kills [[rapist]]s, muggers, [[drug dealer]]s, [[gang]] members, abusive husbands, and even [[drug addiction|drug addicted]] negligent mothers. He is almost killed in an unsuccessful attempt to kill a narcotics supplier known as Backhand. Upon the advice of Salinger, Gerhardt briefly takes a hiatus from his mission while he undergoes to intensive physical and mental training. Also, during this time, he familiarizes himself with the ways and habits of street gangs and criminals. Finished with training, he retires the original, more flamboyant, [[Zorro]]-like, Foolkiller costume and adopts a more [[utilitarian]] outfit with a [[bondage]]-style mask. Also, Gerhardt would also adopt a variety of discreet disguises during his killing spree.

At first, Gerhardt's [[crusade]] is hailed by the public as the poor man's answer to [[The Punisher]]. However, his killing spree hits a major climax when he massacres all of the inhabitants of a crackhouse, including the children. This causes Gerhardt not only emotional [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], but it also forces him to reevaluate the definition of the word "fool". A revelation comes when Gerhardt is shown a misspelled auto repair sign and realizes that people willingly trust their car to someone who can't even be bothered to correctly spell what they do for a living. From this, Gerhardt suggests a laziness on the part of people to realize a [[common good]] as well as a predisposition towards momentary gratification at the expense of the bigger picture.

With his newly realized definition of "fool," Gerhardt decies to go after greedy merchants, racist cops, hypocritical war-protesters and war supporters alike, and even the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Empire State University (ESU) who, while at a press conference, patronizingly danced around the issue of [[misogyny|misogynistic]] language on campus. Gerhardt also kills [[industrialist]], Darren Waite, who had planned to strip acres of [[Amazon rain forest]] in order to raise [[cattle]] for [[beef]]. He also kills Runyan Moody on live television. As a result of these killings, the public turns hostile to the Foolkiller. 

Gerhardt comes to the realization that his death was approaching and cuts off correspondence with a saddened Greg Salinger. However, police eventually discovered the correspondence between the two and Gerhardt becomes a wanted man. Deciding to go out in glory, Gerhardt attemps once more to eliminate the elusive Backhand as well as Waite's right hand man, Emilio Mendoza. While successfully arranging Mendoza's death, Backhand escapes, though with serious injuries. As a result, Gerhardt realizes that, were he to continue living, he would have to change his appearance. With this in mind, he persuades Merle to splash his face with acid. 

Gerhardt eventually relocates to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], where he checks himself into a [[hospital]] for [[reconstructive surgery]]. His new identity, according to his falsified [[Nevada]] [[driver's license]], was "Gregory Ross Curtis" - a combination of the names of all three Foolkillers' first names. The picture seen on his driver's licence resembles Richard Rory.

==Powers and abilities ==

All three Foolkillers carried a pistol which they called their "Purification Gun". The exact nature of this weapon and it's manufacturer are unknown. It shoots a silent, white, [[laser]]-like beam that is capable of instantly incinerating a human being. 
The first two Foolkillers also used an armored truck containing surveillance equipment and a computer database. The first Foolkiller kept the glass tank containing Reverend Mike's preserved body in this truck.

==Calling card==
Ross G. Everbest and Greg Salinger (Foolkiller I & II) sent notices to their intended victims which read:

:Foolkiller

:[[e pluribus unum]]

:You have 24 hours to live.
:Use them to repent or be
:forever damned to the pits 
:of [[hell]] where goeth all fools.
:Today is the last day of the
:rest of your life. Use it wisely
:Or die a fool.

Kurt Gerhardt left a card at the scene of his kills which simply said:

:Foolkiller

:e pluribus unum

:Actions have consequences.


== Memorable Quotes ==

===Kurt Gerhardt===

*"The joke used to be that 'If a [[conservative]] is a [[liberal]] who's been mugged, then a liberal is a conservative who loses his job during the most sustained economic boom in history'. What does this make a person who's been mugged and lost his job?"

*"The way we live today, diligence in never rewarded. The prize goes not to the most qualifed but to the one who presents himself in the slickest possible manner and who makes the most minimal demand on the limited attention span of his audience. The principle is as true in executive suites as it is in movie theaters. The trick seems to be: tell them what they want to know, especially about themselves, and dress appropriately when doing so."

*"Thinking demands effort. Principle presupposes thinking. [[Conscience]] presupposes principle. Restraint presupposes concience. Ordinary civility presupposes restraint. Recognition of a common good presupposes at least a minimal level of civility. Without belief in the common good, the link between actions and all but their immediate personal consequences is severed. Devalue effort and it all collapses."

*"The underdog wins through the exertion of effort, which makes him by current standards, not a winner but a sucker. The winner is someone who never has to try. Once you grasp that, the world makes a horrifying kind of sense."

*''(on the [[Gulf War]])'' "War may bring out something noble in the men and women whose lives are truly at stake &mdash; I don't know. At home however, in this new age of barbarism, it seems to bring out the fools."

===Greg Salinger===

*"Let us agree from the outset that most of humanity is not [[insane]]. Madmen cannot be held accountable for their actions. If lunatics had fashioned the world we inhabit &mdash; its culture, its [[law]]s, its [[politics]], its [[economics]] &mdash; there would be no one to blame for its condition or ours."

*"I didn't share Everbest's religious beliefs. I was more inclined to think in literary rather than theological terms but it was clear to me that something had gone dreadfully wrong with our society. We were adopting an ethic of mindless hedonism and a short run mentality. You could hear it as clearly in the music ([[Disco]] back then) as you could in the testimonials during the [[Watergate]] hearings."

*"The [[poetry]] had gone out of living, the cognizance that things of beauty &mdash; acts of beauty &mdash; were essential to human existence. We were living only to consume &mdash; treating our lives, our values, our friends and lovers as nothing more than mere products."

*(''to the Defenders'')"Can't you see that it's mediocrity like yours that's an excuse for fools everywhere? That's why my mission is so important. I draw the line!"

*"I wasn't mad in the beginning. And my assessment of the human condition wasn't wrong. What drove me past the brink was my failure to change anything. The fools are still running the planet and now their senselessness has spread to the common man."

*"I was irrelevant, Everbest was irrelevant. The guy in [[New York]] is too. When the world begets too many fools, nature always provides a Foolkiller."

===Darren Waite===

*''(on the Foolkiller)'' "This is a man who hates success and hides his fear and envy behind a mask and some idiot notion that he's on a holy crusade."

===Reverend Mal Flapton{{ref|MalFlapton}} ===

* "Who are you calling a [[racism|racist]]? Racism is the tool by which the powerful exploit, exclude, and oppress the powerless. See my skin? I'm powerless. By definition, I can't be racist!"

: ''(reply)'' Kurt Gerhardt: "By definition, you're a fool."

===Dean of ESU===

*"We certainly wish to safeguard the rights of women. However, students who pursue alternative lifestyles are most apt to suffer damage to their self esteem as a result of insensitive language." 

: ''(reply)'' Kurt Gerhardt: "Would your self esteem suffer, Dean &mdash; if I called you a fool?"

==Notes==

1. {{note|Moody}} The Runyan Moody show has intentional parrallels to the late [[1980s]]' ''The [[Morton Downey Jr.]] Show''.

2. {{note|S&L}} Gerhardt lost his job during the [[savings and loan crisis]] that plagued the 1980s.

3. {{note|MalFlapton}} Reverend Mal Flapton is noticeably inspired by Reverend [[Al Sharpton]].
