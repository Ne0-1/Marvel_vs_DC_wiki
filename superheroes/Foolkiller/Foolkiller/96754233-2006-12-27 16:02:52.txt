The '''Foolkiller''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[vigilante]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and first appeared in the pages of 1974's ''[[Man-Thing]]''. He also had a ten-issue [[limited series]] that ran from 1990 to 1991. There have been three different individuals to adopt the mantle of the Foolkiller.

==Ross G. Everbest==
The original Foolkiller, introduced in ''Man-Thing'' #3 and killed in the next issue, was more of a [[reactionary]] crusader than subsequent versions of the character. Upset by anti-[[Vietnam War]] protests and [[counterculture]] movements, he decided that sinners, dissidents, and criminals alike were "fools" who must be eliminated, and that he had been chosen by [[God]] to do so. He was inspired by a [[faith healer]], Reverend Mike Pike, who cured his childhood paralysis; but after catching Reverend Mike in a drunken orgy, he killed his former hero, preserved the corpse in [[formaldehyde]], and used the preacher's money to fund his vigilante activities. He donned a flamboyant costume and acquired (by unknown means) his "purification gun", a [[raygun]] which disintegrated people instantly. Some of his victims were given a 24-hour warning in the form of a calling card: "Foolkiller / [[e pluribus unum]] / You have 24 hours to live. Use them to repent or be forever damned to the pits of hell where goeth all fools. Today is the last day of the rest of your life. Use it wisely or die a fool."

In his brief ''Man-Thing'' appearance, the Foolkiller attempted to kill two major characters in the series: F.A. Schist, a real estate developer whose projects threatened the ecology of the [[Florida Everglades]], and Richard Rory, a disk jockey who had denounced the Foolkiller's activities. During a struggle with the monstrous Man-Thing, the Foolkiller died in a freak accident, impaled by a shard of glass from the tank containing Reverend Mike.

His real name was not given until a later flashback in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #225, which stated that it was Ross G. Everbest (a variant of Gerber's Reg Everbest pseudonym with his middle name attached to it).

==Greg Salinger==
Gerber created the second version of the character in ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'' #9 (plus a one-panel cameo in #8, which was written by [[Roger Stern]]), in which Greg Salinger, imprisoned for [[disorderly conduct]], heard the story of the first Foolkiller from his cellmate, [[Richard Rory]], incarcerated on a trumped-up [[kidnapping]] charge since ''[[Man-Thing]]'' #20. After being released, he stole the Foolkiller's equipment and assumed his identity, using the "purification gun" to kill a number of people in New York including the [[supervillain]] [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]]. Unlike his religiously inspired predecessor, Salinger defined "fools" as those guilty of [[materialism]] and mediocrity, or anyone who lacked "a poetic nature".

In issues #73-75 of ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', written by [[Ed Hannigan]], Rory, feeling responsible for Salinger's breakdown and crimes, tried to help the Defenders arrest Salinger, by persuading him that he could join them as a [[superhero]]. However, Salinger had decided the Defenders were "fools" after their failure to capture another supervillain; he burned down their headquarters and was captured, but escaped in a road accident. He reappeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' 58-60 and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #225-226, written by Roger Stern, studying at Empire State University, where teaching assistant Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]) befriended him, then stopped him in the midst of another killing spree. When a witness suggested that only a fool would fight Spider-Man, Salinger attempted to shoot himself, but was stopped, arrested, found [[criminally insane]] and institutionalized for good. He appeared briefly as a mental patient in ''[[Captain America]]'' #319 (Stern) and in the ''Foolkiller'' miniseries (Gerber).

==Kurt Gerhardt==
Gerber's ''Foolkiller'' miniseries, illustrated by [[JJ Birch]], was published from October 1990 to October 1991. It focused on a new character, Kurt Gerhardt, who reached a state of homicidal despair after the random murder of his father, a divorce, the loss of his bank job (part of the [[savings and loan crisis]]), and being brutally robbed at his new job in a fast-food restaurant. After Gerhardt saw a televised interview with Greg Salinger, they began to correspond about what they both saw as the depraved state of the world. Salinger directed Gerhardt to an old confidant who provided him with the Foolkiller costume and "purification gun". He eventually abandoned the gaudy costume, substituting a simple leather mask and vest (or appearing in a variety of disguises), and created a simpler calling card: "Foolkiller / e pluribus unum / Actions have consequences."

Salinger was granted access by his therapist to a computer's [[word processor]] so that he could write his memoirs. Because his mail was subject to being screened by institutional staff, Salinger secretly used the modem on the computer (which his therapist was unaware of) to communicate with Gerhardt through a [[Bulletin board system|BBS]].

Initially, Gerhardt directed his vigilante campaign at violent criminals, garnering some praise from the public, but his anger at abuse and neglect in general led him to kill drug-addicted negligent mothers and even their children in a series of escalating massacres. His ever broader definition of "fools" who deserved death eventually included everyone he considered guilty of laziness or hypocrisy of any kind. At the end of the series, after escaping the police (his online communications with Salinger discovered) and failing to kill his drug-lord nemesis, Gerhardt had his face altered and left [[New York]] to assume a new identity in [[Arizona]].

Gerhardt appeared recently in ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' as a Raft inmate, after [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] organized a massive breakout, and was seen attacking Spider-Man with many other villains, after which he escaped.

==Marvel MAX==
{{future comic}} 
Marvel have recently announced that a new Foolkiller limited series, written by [[Gregg Hurwitz]], will be released under their [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] adult imprint beginning February 2007.

== 2099 Continuity ==
A cabal of fundamentalist super soldiers modelled themselves after the Foolkillers of the 20th Century. One of their number was encountered by the [[X-Men 2099|X-Men]] of 2099 after he embarked on a mission to assassinate all former members of [[Xi'an_(comics)|Xi'an Chi Xan]]'s original team, "The Lawless."
