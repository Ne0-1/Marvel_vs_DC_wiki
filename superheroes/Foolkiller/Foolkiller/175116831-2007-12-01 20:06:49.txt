The '''Foolkiller''' is a fictional character appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and first appeared in the pages of 1974's ''[[Man-Thing]]''. He also had a ten-issue [[limited series]] that ran from 1990 to 1991. There have been three different individuals to adopt the mantle of the Foolkiller. The character was inspired by a [[Southern United States|Southern]] legend that was the basis for a short story by [[O. Henry]]. This in turn was the inspiration for a later novel by [[Helen Eustis]]. The novel was made into a film featuring [[Anthony Perkins]]. A character of the same name also appeared in [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Enchanted Island of Yew]]''.

==Ross G. Everbest==
[[Image:FoolkillerMarvel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Everbest as the first Foolkiller.]]
The original Foolkiller, introduced in ''Man-Thing'' #3 and killed in the next issue, was more of a [[reactionary]] crusader than subsequent versions of the character. Upset by anti-[[Vietnam War]] protests and [[counterculture]] movements, he decided that sinners, dissidents, and criminals alike were "fools" who must be eliminated, and that he had been chosen by [[God]] to do so. He was inspired by a [[faith healer]], Reverend Mike Pike, who cured his childhood paralysis. As a result, he became an evangelist with Reverend Mike as his mentor and soon became as popular as the Reverend. But after catching Reverend Mike in a drunken orgy, he killed his former hero, preserved the corpse in [[formaldehyde]], and used the preacher's money to fund his vigilante activities. He donned a flamboyant [[Zorro]]-like costume and acquired (by unknown means) his "purification gun", a [[raygun]] which disintegrated people instantly. Some of his victims were given a 24-hour warning in the form of a calling card: "Foolkiller / [[e pluribus unum]] / You have 24 hours to live. Use them to repent or be forever damned to the pits of hell where goeth all fools. Today is the last day of the rest of your life. Use it wisely or die a fool."

In his brief ''Man-Thing'' appearance, the Foolkiller attempted to kill two major characters in the series: F.A. Schist, a real estate developer whose projects threatened the ecology of the [[Florida Everglades]], and Richard Rory, a disk jockey who had denounced the Foolkiller's activities. During a struggle with the monstrous Man-Thing, the Foolkiller died in a freak accident, impaled by a shard of glass from the tank containing Reverend Mike.<ref>Man-Thing #4</ref>

His real name was not given until a later flashback in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #225, which stated that it was Ross G. Everbest (a variant of Gerber's Reg Everbest pseudonym with his middle name attached to it).

==Greg Salinger==
Gerber created the second version of the character in ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'' #9 (plus a one-panel cameo in #8, which was written by [[Roger Stern]]), in which Greg Salinger, imprisoned for [[disorderly conduct]], heard the story of the first Foolkiller from his cellmate, [[Richard Rory]], incarcerated on a trumped-up [[kidnapping]] charge since ''[[Man-Thing]]'' #20. After being released, he stole the Foolkiller's equipment and assumed his identity, using the "purification gun" to kill a number of people in New York including the [[supervillain]] [[Blockbuster (Man-Brute)|Blockbuster]]. Unlike his religiously inspired predecessor, Salinger defined "fools" as those guilty of [[materialism]] and mediocrity, or anyone who lacked "a poetic nature".

In issues #73-75 of ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', written by [[Ed Hannigan]], Rory, feeling responsible for Salinger's breakdown and crimes, tried to help the Defenders arrest Salinger, by persuading him that he could join them as a [[superhero]]. However, Salinger had decided the Defenders were "fools" after their failure to capture another supervillain; he burned down their headquarters and was captured, but escaped in a road accident. He reappeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #58-60 and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #225-226, written by Roger Stern, studying at [[Empire State University]], where [[teaching assistant]] Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]) befriended him, then stopped him in the midst of another killing spree. When a witness suggested that only a fool would fight Spider-Man, Salinger attempted to shoot himself, but was stopped, arrested, found [[criminally insane]] and institutionalized for good. He appeared briefly as a mental patient in ''[[Captain America]]'' #319 (Stern) where he was questioned by Captain America concerning a possible connection with the vigilante known as [[Scourge of the Underworld]]. He also appeared as a seemingly much saner inmate in the ''Foolkiller'' miniseries (Gerber).

==Kurt Gerhardt==
Gerber's ''Foolkiller'' miniseries, illustrated by [[JJ Birch]], was published from October 1990 to October 1991. It focused on a new character, Kurt Gerhardt, who reached a state of homicidal despair after the random murder of his father, a divorce, the loss of his bank job (part of the [[savings and loan crisis]]), and being brutally robbed at his new job in a fast-food restaurant. 

The first issue shows much of Salinger's life in the mental hospital. He details nightmares and guilt to his doctor. He expresses a desire to write out his feelings, believing it will make him feel better. The doctor points out that the last time Salinger was given a pencil, he drove it into his own neck. Salinger promises it won't happen again. The therapist allows Salinger to use one of the institution's computers' word processors so that he can write letters. He decides to send his memoirs and thoughts to media and publication centers. No reply comes back. 

Salinger is noted by popular talk show host, Runyan Moody, who browbeats his way into an interview with Salinger. Gerhardt sees this and via Salinger's secret use of the modem in his therapist's computer, they set up a correpsondence via a [[computer bulletin board]]. 

Salinger directs Gerhardt to an old confidant who provides him with the Foolkiller costume and "purification gun". He eventually abandoned the gaudy costume, substituting a [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]-style leather mask and outfit (or appearing in a variety of disguises), and created a simpler calling card: "Foolkiller / e pluribus unum / Actions have consequences."

Initially, Gerhardt directed his vigilante campaign at violent criminals, garnering some praise from the public, but his anger at abuse and neglect in general led him to kill drug-addicted negligent mothers and even their (albeit violent) children in a series of escalating massacres. His ever broader definition of "fools" who deserved death broadened to include those guilty of what Gerhardt believed to be rank hypocrisy or stupidity. 

At Burger Clown, Gerhardt he develops a promising romantic relationship with a fellow coworker, Linda Klein. He becomes a popular man in his neighborhood. Acting heroically, even without the gun, Gerhardt saves an acquantice from being run down by a drunk. Gerhardt, however, must be stopped from beating on the driver.

In a move celebrated by his friends at the restaurant, he gains a job at a credit agency. His work-neighbor is a crass, older man who enjoys using his power for thrills and cheap revenge. In a moment of weakness, Gerhardt even considers using his gun on this man, along with others who are guilty of only being annoying. This includes the new man in Linda Klein's life.

Gerhardt was especially frustrated at the public's thoughtless pursuit of instant or momentary gratification and this became the centralizing theme of his killing spree. His ever-increasing kills become more violent, taking place in front of, and traumatizing, many innocent people. Once such incident is viewed by his love interest. He even goes after 'foolish' celebrities. His final major kill was an industrialist who was stripping [[Amazon rain forest]] land to raise cattle for beef and this turned the public hostile towards the Foolkiller. At the end of the series, after escaping the police (his online communications with Salinger discovered) and failing to kill his drug-lord nemesis, Gerhardt had his face altered with the assistance of his predecessor's friend. She carefully uses acid to mar his face. He leaves [[New York]] to assume a new identity in [[Arizona]].

Gerhardt appeared in ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' as a Raft inmate, although the circumstances surrounding his capture have not been revealed. After [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] organizes a massive breakout, he was seen attacking Spider-Man with many other villains, after which he escaped.

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.

==Marvel MAX==
{{future comic}} 
Marvel have recently announced that a new Foolkiller limited series, written by [[Gregg Hurwitz]], will be released under their [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] adult imprint.  Hurwitz, in [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=120557 a 2007 Newsarama.com interview], had this to say:

{{cquote|I’m a Punisher guy. What Garth Ennis has done with Frank Castle really is what made me realize what comic books could do. The Foolkiller is obviously different in a number of ways from the Punisher, but he’s also perhaps the closest thing the Marvel Universe has to him.}}

Similarly, [[Axel Alonso]], [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=120373 on the same site]:

{{cquote|He was interested in writing a crime thriller and Punisher was off the table.}}

Foolkiller MAX, debuted with issue #1 in October 2007.

== 2099 Continuity ==
A cabal of fundamentalist super soldiers modelled themselves after the Foolkillers of the 20th Century. One of their number was encountered by the [[X-Men 2099|X-Men]] of 2099 after he embarked on a mission to assassinate all former members of [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an Chi Xan]]'s original team, "The Lawless."

== Misc ==
*In the New Avengers: Most Wanted Files, Spider-Man recalls that he found it unusual that during the Raft breakout, Gerhardt called him out along with other inmates who had a vendetta against Spider Man. Although Spider-Man does make an appearance in Foolkiller issue #8 he does not encounter Gerhardt. He also recalls hearing that Salinger was briefly released by a government agent to go on a killing spree in order to frame [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]. This was briefly seen in [[Marvel Team-Up]] #172 where the framing scheme was a failure.

* New Avengers Most Wanted Files also incorrectly states that Foolkiller killed his drug dealer nemesis, Backhand. The man instead escaped, though seriously crippled by Gerhardt's attack.
