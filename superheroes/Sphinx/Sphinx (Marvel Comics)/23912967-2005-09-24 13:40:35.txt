The '''Sphinx''' is the name of two [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Both Sphinxes are [[Ancient Egypt]]ians who have repeatedly fought [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and the other members of the [[New Warriors]].

The first Sphinx, '''Anath-Na Mut''', was kidnapped and given psychic powers by the alien Caretaker of Arcturus, who wished to create an army of superhumans.  He escaped from the Caretakers and returned to Egypt.  There, he styled himself as a magician and entered the court of the [[Pharaoh]].  He fought and was defeated by [[Moses]] in the Marvel Universe version of the [[Exodus]], and was exiled into the desert for his failure.  He discovered the alien Ka Stone, which granted him immortality and the power to reshape reality.  He became the Sphinx and wandered the Earth for thousands of years, becoming bored with his immortality as time passed.  Using his psychic powers to read minds while searching for a way to end his life, he scanned the mind of Nova (Richard Rider), a human empowered by the aliens of Xandar.  Nova had been given subconscious knowledge of Xandar's Living Computer, a computer connected to the still-living brains of deceased Xandarans.  The Sphinx theorized that the Living Computer might be able to tell him how to die.  The Sphinx fought Nova and several of Nova's foes, but was unable to learn what he wished to know.  The android [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] directed the Sphinx to Xandar, where he fought the [[Fantastic Four]] and Nova.  He connected with the Living Computer, and then attempted to do the same with the ship of the world-eater [[Galactus]].  Galactus punished him by destroying the Ka Stone and then sending the Sphinx back in time to inhabit his own body at the moment that he received the Ka Stone.

However, he instead travelled back in time psychically and met himself.  The future self warned the younger of what would happen, and the two built a machine that would reform the shattered Ka Stone in the future after Galactus destroyed it.  In order to not alter the future, the past Sphinx was hypnotized to forget what he had just learned and done, and the future Sphinx entered suspended animation, awakening after the point at which he had been sent back in time.  He activated the machine to rebuild the Ka Stone, only for the machine to be destroyed by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], fomerly of the Fantastic Four.  The Sphinx attempted to kill the Thing in retaliation, but the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]], who was secrerly observing and assisting the Thing, used his mystic puppets to take control of the Sphinx's body.  The Sphinx was forced to crush the partially regenerated Ka Stone, and as a result he immediately succumbed to five thousands years of aging and crumbled to dust.

The second Sphinx, '''Meryet Karim''', was Anath-Na Mut's lover while he was exiled in the desert.  Residual energies from the Ka Stone granted her a fraction of his power, and upon her death, she found herself perpetually recincarnated into new bodies, retaining the knowledge of her previous lives with each new birth.  In one life, she was a man who became a pharaoh's pyramid architect, and was given a burial pyramid by means of recompense.  She used this pyramid as a place to store the riches that she had accumulated over the years.  In the modern day, she used this wealth to become a powerful businesswoman, and was able to reconstruct the machine that had reconstituted the Ka Stone.  She the remade Ka Stone, becoming the new Sphinx in the process.  She used the Ka Stone to alter history so that Anath-Na Mut had killed Moses; as a result, Egypt had come under the leadership of the Sphinxes and conquered the world.  However, even this power was not enough to restore Anath-Na Mut to life, although a portion of his soul lived on in their cat.  The [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (led by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], combining the roles of the [[X-Men]] and the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]) were the only real opposition to her rule, and many of them were killed by her enforcers, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  When Nova, formerly one of her newest Avengers, threatened to kill the Sphinx-empowered cat, she relented and restored the world to normal.  However, in the normal world, the cat immediately disintegrated, as the cat had only been empowered in the Sphinx's altered world.  She flew away, vowing revenge.

Later, Anath-Na Mut was resurrected by the Ka Stone, and the two Sphinxes merged into the much more powerful "Omni-Sphinx".  However, when next seen, the original Sphinx was active without the female Sphinx, having presumably returned to his original body.
