'''Red Ronin''' is a gigantic [[robot]]ic construct (a [[mecha]]) in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Originally created by writer [[Doug Moench]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]] as a foil for [[Godzilla]], the robot went on to be a menace to other Marvel characters such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  

Red Ronin's design was influenced by those of the [[super robots]] that were the staple of [[anime]] during the [[1970s]].  Super robots first came into the notice of American pop culture in the form of the [[Gigantor]] ([[Tetsujin 28]]) anime series that was imported into the [[United States]] from [[Japan]] during the [[1960s]].  [[Mattel]]'s line of imported [[Shogun Warriors]] toys became popular in the United States during the late [[1970s]], the same time period that Red Ronin first appeared in Marvel Comics.  Indeed, then Marvel Editor-In-Chief [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] admitted that Red Ronin's basic design was inspired by the super robots of anime.  

==History==

Red Ronin was developed with the assistance of [[Stark International]] by engineers and scientists Tamara Hashioka and Yuriko Takiguchi. It was intended to be used by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] against the monster [[Godzilla]]. Before it could be utilized for this purpose, the robot was stolen by Takiguchi's twelve year old grandson Rob. Originally referred to as SJ3RX, the robot was named Red Ronin by the youngster.

After an initial attempt to control the robot failed, Rob succeeded in piloting Red Ronin into battle with Godzilla, in an attempt to drive the beast off. Rob wished to prevent the radioactive creature from being harmed and his attempts to ward the monster off were designed to actually preserve his life. He succeeded in doing so and it was discovered that Ronin had been imprinted with Rob's brain patterns, making the robot useless without him to pilot it.

Rob used Ronin a few more times, aiding Godzilla in battles against creatures such as [[Yetrigar]], [[Krollar]], [[Rhian]], and [[Triax]]. During one such battle, Rhian decapitated Ronin, leaving the robot inactive.

S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually rebuilt the robot with the aid of Stark technicians. One such technician, Earl Cowan, altered the robot so it would only respond to his brain patterns, similarly to how it had previously been linked to Rob Takaguchi. Cowan intended to use Ronin to orchestrate a series of events that would set off [[World War III]]. Fortunately, Cowan was completely ignorant of the shortest aerial route to the [[USSR]] and went eastward instead of going north and passed over [[New York City]].  This allowed the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to intercept and defeat Red Ronin, and the robot's remains were carried off by S.H.I.E.L.D.

[[Stane International]] eventually gained possession of the remains. A scientist named Karaguchi Inoyawa rebuilt the robot, hoping to use it as a force for good. The robot was displayed by Stane at a trade show at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]]. While there it was commandeered by vengeful ex-Stane employee Joe Kilman who caused it to go on a rampage. This time Inoyawa guided the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] in deactivating Ronin.

Ronin eventually wound up in the hands of [[Fujikawa Electronics]]. It was altered to look more like a samurai in appearance. Numerous military and criminal organizations such as [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]] attempted to gain possession of the mechanoid, but were foiled by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Sunfire]].

When Red Ronin next appeared, it was used by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] to lure the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] into a battle with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. 

Red Ronin appeared in the [[Mega Morphs]] mini-series, when [[Doctor Doom]] had [[Doctor Octopus]] reprogram it, so Doom could control it remotely. After easily taking down the Mega Morphs of [[Captain America]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine]], and [[Ghost Rider]], it is defeated by the [[Incredible Hulk]], whom Doom took over to assist in the prison break of Doc Ock, previously.

Red Ronin has since "joined" the [[Thunderbolts]] during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] series. [[Tony Stark]] mentioned in the "Civil War Files" one-shot working on that version and that the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] is likely all over it.

==Abilities==

Red Ronin is over 100 ft. tall and weighs in excess of 23 tons.

Red Ronin possesses immense strength and is highly durable. The robot can [[flight|fly]] at subsonic speed and is armed with a solar powered sword and pulsating shield that doubles as a [[laser]] [[gatling gun]]. The gatling gun was capable of firing blasts that generated concussive force equivalent to 100 tons of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]].  Additionally, the shield was capable of firing missiles, which Red Ronin used during its battle against Yetrigar in the [[Grand Canyon]]. The shield can also be used as a detachable weapon and contains a homing device that enables it to return to the robot. Red Ronin's left hand has the ability to convert to an energy cannon.   

Ronin later gained the ability to detach its hands from its body and retain control of them while detached.

==Alternate versions==

A version of Red Ronin appeared on an Earth visited by the time-hopping heroes known as the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. On this Earth it was the chief weapon of a group of monster hunters known as the Science Squad and was invented by one of the Squad's members, [[Bolivar Trask]]. This version of Ronin was destroyed by this reality's version of [[Fin Fang Foom]].
