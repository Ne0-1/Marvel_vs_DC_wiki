==Character Biography==
[[Image:RockPythonSS.jpg|thumb|90px|left|Rock Python.]]
Rock Python has skin that is rock-hard, much like a rock python [[snake]], and he also uses little eggs which, upon impact, release "snake wrap", metallic coils that wrap up and immobilize his opponents.  He first joined the Serpent Society when the villainous [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] invaded, and after she abandoned them, he took a test to prove his worthiness of being in the Society.  He also later battled the [[X-Men]]'s [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] with the rest of the Serpent Society, but quickly when he realized his opponents were much more powerful than him.  His greatest accomplishment was nearly killing [[Captain America]] after he, [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], and [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]] were attacked.  He dropped him from a rooftop, but was ordered by [[King Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]] to flee as to not have their base revealed.  He continues to serve with the Society.
