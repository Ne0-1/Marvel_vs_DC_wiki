==Powers and abilities==
Rock Python has skin, muscle, and bones that are rock-hard, much like a rock python [[snake]]. He is impervious to high caliber arms fire, powerful explosions, intense heat, and deadly impacts. He carries little gimmick "snake eggs" which, upon impact, release various substances such as smoke bombs, acids, plastic explosives, and "snake wrap": explosive-launched inch wide, razor-sharp steel alloy metallic ribbons designed to ensnare opponents like bolas and immobilize them, and are approximately {{convert|25|ft|m}} in length.
