'''Rock Python''' ('''M'Gula''') is a fictional [[super villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]], and is a member of the [[Serpent Society]].  He first appeared in ''Captain America'' vol. 1 #341 in May 1988.

==Fictional character biography==
Rock Python first joined the Serpent Society when the villainous [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] invaded, and after she abandoned them, he took a test to prove his worthiness of being in the Society.  He also later battled the [[X-Men]]'s [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] with the rest of the Serpent Society, but quickly surrendered when he realized his opponents were much more powerful than him.  His greatest accomplishment was nearly killing [[Captain America]] after he, [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], and [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]] were attacked.  He dropped him from a rooftop, but was ordered by [[King Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]] to flee as to not have their base revealed.  He continues to serve with the Society.

He's recently appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar.
