==Character developments==
In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Nico was called Rachel Messina. Her parents were still magicians, but posed as wealthy antique dealers; this cover story was ultimately used for Gert's time travelling parents.<ref name="original">Runaways Vol. 1 Hardcover</ref> Nico's source of power wasn't originally going to be her mother's Staff, but Robert Minoru's spellbook.<ref name="original"/>

==Fictional character biography==
===The Pride===
The daughter of Robert and Tina Minoru, Nico is first heard searching for her black nail polish; at the Wilder's supposed charity organization, Nico witnesses her father speaking an enchantment, and after witnessing the murder of an innocent girl by their parents ("the Pride"), Nico screams, prompting the Pride to worry if their children had seen the murder. Nico remains shocked through the ordeal, and agrees with Alex and Gert's wish of phoning the police.<ref name="Vol1#2"/> Nico joins the rest of the team in the massive ransack away from their parents; while at the Steins' laboratory, Nico enounters her parents. Her mother, wielding a large staff with a ball at the end, reveals that her parents are dark wizards; she then attempts to jam the staff into Nico's chest. Nico's body, curiously, absorbs it, and her shocked mother identifies it as the Staff of One.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> Later, Nico's wrist is cut by Mr. Yorkes' [[Samurai]] battle-axe, and the Staff subsequently emerges from her chest, prompting Nico to use the phrase "Freeze", to freeze Mrs. Yorkes. Nico is revealed to be a witch.<ref name="Vol1#5">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #5</ref> After running off, Nico takes on the name Sister Grimm, to match her AIM handle.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> Out of all of the Runaways, Nico is the first to drop her nickname, telling the vampire, Topher, she thinks it's weird she is being called Sister by people she isn't being related to.<ref name="Vol1#2">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #2</ref> After Alex outs himself as the mole and is defeated along with the Pride, Nico is generally accepted as the [[de facto]] leader.<ref name="Vol1#18">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #18</ref>

===Mystic Arcana===
In 2007, the magic-related crossover event [[Mystic Arcana]]<ref name="mysticarcana">{{Comic book reference | Writer = C.B. Cebulski | Artist = Phil Noto | Story = Book Four: Fire | Title = [[Mystic Arcana]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 4 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> fills the gap between ''Runaways'' volume 1 #17 and #18, during Nico's brief time at Father Flanagan's Home for Unwanted Goth Kids.<ref name="mysticarcana"/> The story begins with Nico dressed in plain clothing, stating that it's perhaps time to let go of the goth trend. She is soon talked into going to a [[nightclub]] with her friends, where she meets her parents' old rival [[Marie Laveau]];<ref name="mysticarcana"/> Laveau seeks revenge on Nico's parents for stealing the Black Mirror, one of the four Cornerstones of Creation. After Laveau explains that she needs Nico's blood to activate the Black Mirror, the two fight, and Nico easily wins. Nico attempts to bring back Alex Wilder using the Mirror, however the spell fails, the Mirror shatters and the last page of the Darkhold is revealed behind the glass.<ref name="mysticarcana"/> Laveau takes it and flees, while Nico accepts her place as an outcast and with the Runaways.<ref name="mysticarcana"/>

===As a fugitive===
After being warned of a future threat named Victor Mancha, Nico and the Runaways find and abduct Victor to question him. After Victor's mother is murdered and father, [[Ultron]], is destroyed, Nico invites Victor to become a part of the team, much to the anger of some members, notably Chase. Nico reassures them that she is willing to "rip [Victor's] damn heart out" if necessary.<ref name="Vol2#1"/> After Chase ties Nico up before he attempts to sacrifice himself to the Gibborim, Nico interprets it as a cry for help and leads the Runaways to intervene Chase's self-sacrifice. The Gibborim instead attempt to take Nico, revealing that Nico's soul is innocent, thus, suitable for the Gibborim's consumption. After defeating the Gibborim, Nico leads the Runaways in a cross-country escape from [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref name="Vol2#25">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #25</ref>

===The Witchbreaker===
When the Runaways are time-displaced in 1907 New York, Nico is kidnapped and brought to a woman, named the Witchbreaker, who claims that she is her ancestor and says she is her great-grandmother.<ref name="Vol2#29">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #29</ref> The Witchbreaker states that she will teach Nico how to withstand more pain and, therefore, wield more magic with better proficiency. She wields a weapon similar to the Staff of One, with more adornments. When reunited with her comrades, a significant development to Nico's abilities is evident, where she is freely able to float, displays more proficiency and confidence in casting spells and able to use a spell with an effect more complicated than most of her others thus far.<ref name="Vol2#30">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #30</ref> It is revealed that Nico had obtained the Witchbreaker's Staff.<ref name="Vol2#30"/>

==Attributes==
===Powers and abilities===
[[Image:NicoMinoruSuperheroV2.jpg|110px|thumb|left|The Staff of One.<ref name="Vol1#5"/>]]
Nico, being a witch, uses magic as her weapon. In the early issues, her sole weapon had been the Staff of One, a magical staff that can cast any spell imaginable.<ref name="Vol1#7">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #7</ref> The Staff, however, comes with two limitations; first, and more importantly, Nico cannot cast the same spell twice, or the spell will misfire and a random effect will occur; for example, the second time she tried to cast "Freeze," she produced [[pelicans]], and the second time she attempted to cast a "Fumigation" spell, the staff teleported Nico and Karolina miles in the Los Angeles desert.<ref name="Vol2#7">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #7</ref> The second limitation of the Staff of One is that it cannot be used to bring people back from the dead.<ref name="Vol2#2">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #2</ref> Nico discovered this limitation when she tried to resurrect her Alex Wilder, and explained why she could not magically revive the deceased future version of [[Gertrude Yorkes]].<ref name="Vol2#2"/> Tina Minoru had early mentioned the Staff even made [[Dormammu]] tremble, implying that Nico was only scratching the surface of the Staff's true power.<ref name="comicvine"/> Tina is also able to do spells without saying them, as evident when she turns herself, Robert Minoru, and [[The Steins|the Steins]] into their villain costumes.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> In ''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'', Nico cast a tunneling spell using a [[Latin]] phrase supplied to her by [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|the Vision]].<ref name="cw">''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways</ref>

Only Nico can summon the Staff, but anyone can cast spells with it. When not in use, the Staff retreats into her body, which Nico describes as "feel[ing] like I have something in my eye, but instead of my eye, it's... it's my soul."<ref name="Vol1#7"/> To summon the Staff, Nico sheds blood and unintentionally recites "When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge."<ref name="Vol1#5"/> Early in volume one, Nico would cut herself to release the Staff, often using Chase's [[switchblade]].<ref name="Vol1#8">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #8</ref> As the series progressed, Nico found alternative ways to make herself bleed, including brushing her gums for extended periods of time<ref name="Vol2#16">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #16</ref> and having Gert's [[deinonychus]] [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] bite her arm,<ref name="Vol1#14">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #14</ref>; during her monthly [[menstrual cycle]], Nico does not need to cut herself to evoke the Staff.<ref name="Vol2#1">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #1</ref> The Staff always emerges from the center of her chest, and passes through any clothing she is wearing without damaging it or Nico. However the Staff will damage anyone or anything directly in its way when ejected from Nico's body. For example, the Staff emerges after the vampire Topher begins to drain Nico's blood and pierces directly through the center of his chest.<ref name="Vol1#10"/>

Nico's time with the Witchbreaker has granted her a newer version of the Staff of One called "The Witchbreaker's Staff." Nico can now wield its powers and cast spells with greater proficiency than before.<ref name="Vol2#30"/> Nico can now cast spells without using her Staff, bringing her closer to her parents' abilities.<ref name="Vol3#1">''Runaways'': Volume 3, #1</ref>

===Personality===
[[Image:Staffofone.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Nico summons the Staff of One for the first time.<ref name="Vol1#5"/>]]
Nico is shown to be a very emotional person. She expresses feelings for Alex Wilder during their original getaway, but is hesitant to start a romance.<ref name="Vol1#6">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #6</ref> After Alex saves her from a vampire attack some time later, she impulsively agrees to date him.<ref name="Vol1#14">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #14</ref> This pattern of clinging to people during stressful and/or intense situations follows Nico throughout the remainder of the series.<ref name="Vol2#19">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #19</ref> Despite this, Nico proves her loyalty to the Runaways when Alex betrays the group and offers her a seat in the new world promised by the Pride's [[Holy Bible|Biblical]] benefactors, the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]].<ref name="Vol1#17">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #17</ref> She refuses Alex's offer brutally and helps usher her friends to safety.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Nico is sent to Father Flanagan's Home for Unwanted Goth Kids. However, the group organizes a mass escape from their homes to begin life as full-time [[vigilantes]]; Nico is generally accepted as de facto team leader.<ref name="Vol1#18"/>

When Nico takes leadership position, it proves she has the intelligence and courage to make difficult decision, more notably a risky decision in leaving [[Xavin]] to battle a resurrected Geoffrey Wilder herself saying "Xavin knew the risks".<ref name="Vol2#1">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #1</ref> Nico also kisses Chase after he negotiates their way out of a potentially fatal situation with an interdimensional drug-dealer; this causes a falling out between Nico and Chase's girlfriend Gert, almost dissolving the team from the inside.<ref name="Vol2#17">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #17</ref> Gert's untimely death sends Nico into the arms of Victor Mancha, with whom she reveals she has a habit of running to people when distressed.<ref name="Vol2#19"/> She suffered [[survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] regarding Gert's death. Nico confronts her insecurities of the fact she couldn't be a steady girlfriend in a dream involving her deceased parents berating Nico for acting like a "slut" (for kissing Alex, Topher, Chase, and Victor).<ref name="Vol2#23">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #23</ref> She kills her parents in the dream, a symbol of overcoming her insecurities.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> She begins a relationship with Victor, but it breaks apart after Victor falls for another girl.

==Relationships with other Runaways==
Nico is a very emotional person and has repeatedly expressed difficulty with knowing precisely what she is feeling.<ref name="Vol1#7"/> Nico admits to Victor that she has a tendency to seek comfort after highly emotional situations or periods of stress.<ref name="Vol2#19">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #19</ref> Nonetheless, she is typically very open when trying to express her feelings and has thus been able to connect with many of the Runaways on an emotional level and maintain many close friendships throughout the series. 

In the first volume, Nico and Alex share a brief relationship. She kisses him for the first time during the runaways' attempted rescue of [[Molly Hayes]];<ref name="Vol1#5"/> it's later revealed Alex was Nico's first kiss.<ref name="Vol2#22">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #22</ref> She kisses and expresses love for Alex after he saves her from the vampire Topher; it is generally accepted that Nico and Alex are a couple at this point.<ref name="Vol1#10">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #10</ref> Despite her professed love for Alex, Nico chooses to side with the Runaways after Alex reveals his plan to bring her to the Gibborim's new world with her parents, firmly establishing her dedication to the team and her strength of character. However, despite the betrayal, Nico demonstrates willingness to forgive when she unsuccessfully tries to resurrect Alex, and states that even though Alex was a traitor, he did not deserve death.<ref name="Vol2#2"/>

Karolina's feelings for Nico were hinted at throughout volume 1, ending with Karolina sheepishly blushing when Nico says she has sworn off boys.<ref name="Vol1#18"/> However, Karolina's feelings were not explicitly expressed until she attempted to kiss Nico.<ref name="Vol2#7"/> Nico immediately turned Karolina down; however, when Karolina decides to travel to her home planet Majesdane with [[Xavin]], Nico is distraught and seems to react the strongest to Karolina's departure. Chase stops Nico from casting a spell to bring Karolina back to Earth, and later catches Nico strewing Karolina's clothes about her floor for remembrance's sake. After Karolina returns, Nico becomes overjoyed and hugs her, saying that she felt all alone with Karolina gone. Their friendship is an occasionally strained one, due to Nico's ambiguous feelings towards Karolina and strong dislike of Karolina's fiance, Xavin.<ref name="Vol2#25">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #25</ref>

Nico admits she provides a motherly role to Chase's rule-breaking persona.<ref name="Vol2#9">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #9</ref> The pair maintain a strong respect for each other despite often disagreeing over major group decisions, including Gert's burial site and allowing [[Victor Mancha|Victor]] to join the team.<ref name="Vol2#6">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #6</ref> Chase cares for Nico's safety and well-being, as evidenced from when he comforted Nico after Karolina's departure, and when he took the Staff of One from Nico to destroy it to give her a normal life.<ref name="Vol2#24">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #24</ref> After Chase bluffed their way out of a fatal enounter with the drug lord, Pusher-Man, Nico kisses him. This causes a rift in their friendship, and into Gert and Chase's relationship.<ref name="Vol2#11">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #11</ref> Nico is also the only person that Chase bids farewell before leaving to sacrifice himself for the Gibborim, which Nico interprets as a cry for help.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> At this point, Chase and Nico's friendship appears more stable now that Chase moved past grieving for Gert.<ref name="Vol2#30"/>

Gert and Nico had been close friends since birth.<ref name="Vol2#19"/> After Gert's death, Nico tells Victor (while crying) that Gert had set her [[My Little Pony]] dolls in the forest because Gert thought they should be free, and Nico had knit a purple scarf for Gert's thirteenth birthday, prompting Gert to dye her hair that colour.<ref name="Vol2#19"/> Nico also told Gert that should Nico get hurt, Gert would be leader. The pair's friendship briefly breaks after Gert discovered Nico's kiss with Chase after their encounter with the Pusher Man.<ref name="Vol2#17"/> Their falling out caused much friction in the group. Nico and Gert finally resolved their differences with a short bout of tossing insults. Despite Gert's cynical attitude, she rarely argued with Nico's decisions and was usually prepared to stand by her friend. Nico experiences [[survivor's guilt]] after Gert dies,<ref name="Vol2#19"/> knowing that Gert's murderer [[Geoffrey Wilder]] had initially meant to kill Nico.<ref name="Vol2#18">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #18</ref>

Nico explains that she seeks physical comfort after periods of stress.<ref name="Vol2#19"/> While Victor expresses feelings for Nico, she asks for time alone to clear her head and figure her feelings out, much like how she initially dealt with Alex and Karolina after each expressed feelings for Nico.<ref name="Vol2#19"/> However, Nico admits that Victor is genuinely a good guy and wouldn't mind being in a relationship with him. Victor calls Nico his girlfriend when he attempts to save her from Chase, and although she is in a hostage situation, Nico still lightly scolds Victor for calling her such.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> By the end of [[Brian K. Vaughan|Brian K. Vaughan's]] run on the title, they are a couple.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> [[Joss Whedon]]'s arc, however, introduces a new love interest for Victor, Lillie, a carefree girl from 1907. Trying to become a better person, Nico, seeing that Victor and Lillie are in love, steps aside.<ref name="Vol2#30"/>
