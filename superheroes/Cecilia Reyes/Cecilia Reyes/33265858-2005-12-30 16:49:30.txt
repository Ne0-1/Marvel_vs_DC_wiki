Cecilia Reyes decided to become a doctor when her father was gunned down in front of her as a child, and she was unable to do anything to help him. The X-Men tried recruiting her when it was discovered that she was a mutant, but Reyes had no interest in being a superhero. However, when [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]], a government-backed anti-mutant task force, targeted her, she was forced to join forces with the X-Man [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and other mutants to escape [[New York City]] and track down [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], Operation Zero Tolerance's leader.

Afterwards, Reyes reluctantly joined the X-Men but did not find costumed adventuring suitable for her, and left to set up her own medical practice.

Later, she was caught up in the X-Men's battle with the [[Neo (comics)|Neo]], a villainous group of mutants who claimed to have evolved beyond the level of other mutants. Reyes was trapped in the Neo's fortress below New York City and used a street drug called Rave to make her mutant powers more destructive, ensuring her survival. The X-Men rescued her, and the [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[Professor X]] helped her kick her addiction to Rave.

Later, she was briefly seen as a prisoner at a mutant [[concentration camp]] run by the [[Weapon X]] program, where she attempted to use her medical expertise to help out the other prisoners. She was killed when a brainwashed [[Agent Zero]] destroyed the camp, and her death was later confirmed in the letter column of ''New Excalibur'' #1.
