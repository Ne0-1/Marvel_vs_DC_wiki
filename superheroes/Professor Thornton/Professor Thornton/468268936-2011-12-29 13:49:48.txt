'''Professor Thornton''' is a villain in Wolverine comics whom died at the hands of [[Silver-Fox]]. In 1972 nearly twenty years ago before Logan was romantically involved and abducted with Silver-Fox at Windsor snow lodge.  Thornton experimented on numerous mutants including Sabretooth and [[Mastodon (comics)]]. He hired Carol Hines as his assistant and the scientist Abraham Cornelius. He experiments on wolverine and is responsible for his admantium laced skeleton. He is also connected to the creation of [[Alpha-Flight]] on to developing super-soldiers for the US government. During the process, the pain of past memories wakes wolverine up and enables him to break through the chamber right after it was completed.  Wolverine ends up cutting the professor's hand off and supposedly killing him in a mad rage.  This ending scene clarifies to the reader that the virtual reality simulation of him killing hundreds of personal was indeed hallucinatory and an escape attempt. 

Sometime later Professor Thornton and Hines lure Wolverine into an abandoned warehouse in Canada which was once the secret location for the Weapon X program.  Codenamed Project X, Wolverine soon discovers Weapon X was funded by the CIA and sheltered in Canada.  Thornton's secret weapon, a robotic android named Shiva, is activated to destroy him.  Wolverine discovers the apartment complex is not a Pest control outlet but a trap for revenge. Silver Fox whom works for another secret organization, Hydra is revealed to be behind the entire plan. In the end, the missing character and cohort, [[Silver Fox]], surprises them amidst the fighting thereby killing the professor.<ref>''Wolverine'' #50</ref>
