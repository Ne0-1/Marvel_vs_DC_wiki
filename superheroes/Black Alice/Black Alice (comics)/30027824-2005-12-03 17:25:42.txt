'''Black Alice''' is a [[DC Comics]] character introduced in ''[[Birds of Prey]]'' #76 (January 2005). She is a magically powered anti-hero who uses her powers to prey on drug dealers in her hometown of [[Dayton, Ohio]], and has more recently become a member of the magical superhero group, [[Shadowpact]].

==Origin==

'''Lori Zechlin''' was a [[goth]] teen who lived with her father and her mother, a [[drug addiction|drug addict]]. Neither Lori nor her father suspected Mrs. Zechlin's addiction because she abused stolen prescription pharmaceuticals supplied by local drug dealers. One day, overwhelmed by shame, Mrs. Zechlin put on her best dress, took an overdose of drugs, and drowned herself in the pool.  Lori discovered the body when she came home from school.  She discovered that same night that she could "borrow" the magical powers of others, including [[Zatanna]], [[Black Adam]], [[Dr. Fate]], and others.  Despite her lack of control over these powers (she could wield them as well as their owners, but had no control over the times or duration that the powers would be available to her), she formulated a plan to avenge her mother and punish the prescription drug traffickers whom she saw as above the law.

Lori's father, shattered and slipping into depression, became a recluse.  He tried to pretend for Lori's sake that nothing was wrong. Lori was also distressed by her mother's death, but was aware of the change in her father and assigned herself the role of caregiver. Her grades started to slip, and she became alienated from her peers.  Her primary social group, a [[Wicca|Wiccan]] circle, expelled her because she was emitting "black energy" since her mother's death (in actuality, the circle's leader -- her best friend, Dawn -- was jealous of Lori's real and growing powers).

Having recently left Gotham City following the destruction of their clock tower headquarters, the Birds of Prey were traveling the country by jet in order to identify and help previously unknown [[metahuman]]s.  [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] had become aware of Lori's power, but not her specific abilities.  She sent [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], disguised as a school teacher, to keep an eye on Lori and offer counseling, while [[Black Canary]] was tasked with keeping surveillance on all of Lori's activities. The goal was to determine the specific nature and strength of Lori's powers. While being watched by Black Canary, Lori abruptly left her boyfriend, Kyle, when [[Doctor Fate]]'s power manifested. She decided to use it before its subsidance, and sought out a trio of suspected drug dealers.  When Lori seemed intent to use lethal force, Black Canary intervened to save the lives of the three men.  Doctor Fate's power faded, and Lori fled the scene, tailed by Black Canary.  Suddenly manifesting Zatanna's powers, Lori waylaid Canary and escaped.  Black Canary and Huntress united to tail Kyle in the hopes of rediscovering Lori, and instead found that Kyle was two-timing Lori with Dawn.  Lori discovered the same thing shortly afterwards and prepared to destroy a shopping mall with the powers of Black Adam in her efforts to avenge herself on Kyle.  Black Canary was able to bring her down in an all-out brawl, but it was Huntress who brought a stop to Lori's rampage by presenting a contrite Dawn.  All Lori had needed was for someone to be sorry for the pain and loss she had suffered.  

Oracle turned Lori over to the care of the real Doctor Fate, where she would receive guidance in the use of her powers.

==''Day of Vengeance''==

Black Alice made her second appearance in the ''[[Infinite Crisis|Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries.  While the rest of [[Shadowpact]] were struggling against the combined might of [[Eclipso]] and the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], [[Detective Chimp]] and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]] sought out "the most powerful teenager in the universe" to entice her to join them as their "secret weapon" against the Spectre (''Day of Vengeance'' #4, September 2005).  

After heated discussion with Lori's father, he relented and Lori was allowed to leave with them, only to find that the rest of the Shadowpact had been able to defeat the Spectre and Eclipso by channeling all the power of all magical heroes everywhere through [[Enchantress_(DC_Comics)|The Enchantress]] and into [[Captain Marvel]].  Eclipso and the Spectre survived and escaped, however.  [[Nightmaster]] formulated a new plan wherein Lori would steal the Spectre's powers and use them to destroy the Spectre (''Day of Vengeance'' #5, October 2005).  The plan had an unforeseen flaw: once Lori had taken the Spectre's powers, the Spectre was nothing more than an immaterial spirit, and she could not affect him in any way.  

Eventually (''Day of Vengeance'' #6, November 2005), her grasp of the Spectre's power subsided, but her actions had bought valuable time for Nightshade.  Nightshade was able to neutralize Eclipso by placing her in a permanent undecaying orbit of the sun, where Eclipso's powers could not function.  The Spectre, his powers now restored, turned his attention to the Rock of Eternity, eternal fortress of the wizard, [[Shazam]].  Defeating first Captain Marvel and then Shazam in a protracted struggle, the Spectre apparently killed them both while absorbing their power and adding it to his own.  The death of Shazam and subsequent destruction of the Rock of Eternity released "ancient evils" long contained and caused considerable physical destruction to Earth, especially [[Gotham City]] (above which the Rock finally disintegrated).  

Joined by the previously incapacitated [[Phantom Stranger]], the Shadowpact rededicated themselves to defeating The Spectre and containing the evils that he released (perhaps in the [[Infinite Crisis]] miniseries?).  It remains to be seen what role Black Alice, who asked to be returned to her father, will take in the ongoing struggle.

==Observations==

Black Alice's appearance is that of a teenage girl goth, except when she is manifesting her powers.  Then her clothing transforms into an all-black combination of her own gothic attire and the costume of the person whose powers she is channeling.

Her origin as an alienated teen and her ability to temporarily absorb the abilities of others make her similar to the [[Marvel Comics]] character, [[Rogue_(comics)|Rogue]].
