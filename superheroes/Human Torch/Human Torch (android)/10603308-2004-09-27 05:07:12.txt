The original '''Human Torch''' is a [[fictional character]] who was created in [[1938]] by [[Carl Burgos]] for [[Atlas Comics]]' first [[comic book]], titled ''[[Marvel Comics]]''.

Not to be confused with the [[Human Torch|more modern version]] (a member of the [[Fantastic Four]]), this Human Torch was an [[android]], a mechanical being created by Professor Phineas T. Horton in hopes of creating a more perfect human. He failed in his efforts. Not only did his creation burst into flame when exposed to [[oxygen]], but he rebelled against his [[creator]], not wanting to become a [[slave]] to someone who cared about recognition more than his "child's" own well-being. The public, fearing that he would escape, sealed the Torch in concrete. He escaped due to a convenient crack that let oxygen seep in. New York burned. It was a long while before the Torch learned to control his flame, but when he did, he vowed to never use it to do evil.

The Human Torch was one half of the first major [[fictional crossover|crossover]] in comic book history, a two-issue battle between the Torch and [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] that appeared in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #8-9.

He would join other heroes as war broke out in Europe, and later in the Pacific, to fight the [[Axis powers]]. Within a year, he'd acquired a young partner, Thomas "Toro" Raymond. Toro was the [[mutant]] son of two nuclear scientists whose exposure to radiation gave him the ability to control [[fire]]. He'd also joined the police force as part of his "human cover" under the name Jim Hammond. He would later drop the human name and serve the police force outright as the Human Torch, fighting villians and his off-and-on-again foe, the Sub-Mariner.

After appearing in a wide variety of comics during the [[1940s]], the Human Torch fell victim to a general slump in the superhero market and disappeared for most of the [[1950s]].

In the [[1950s]], the Human Torch was revived and killed off in a short span of time as an atomic bomb test awoke him from his deactivation sleep in the [[Mojave Desert]], only to find that Toro had been captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and brainwashed. He was able to bring Toro back around, but the nuclear bomb had affected his powers. They were far more powerful than they once had been, and much more unstable. Fearing that he would become a danger to those around him, the Torch flew back out into the desert and went nova, using up all his reserve energy and effectively deactivating himself.

He was found once by the [[Fantastic Four]], reactivated, then shut down once again by the crazed android [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]]'s "Destructo-Eye" when he refused to kill the heroes.  A copy of his body was created by the [[time travel]]er [[Immortus]]; this copy was obtained by the villainous android [[Ultron]], who used it to create the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], an android who went on to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

He would be revived one final time in [[John Byrne]]'s ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'' by the [[Scarlet Witch]], who was searching for answers about her husband, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], and Ann Raymond, Tom "Toro" Raymond's wife. He served the Avengers for many issues before losing his powers to save the former superheroine, [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]], in the pages of ''Namor''. His powers gone, he decided to settle down with Ann Raymond.

He would appear later as the CEO of Oracle, Inc., a company run by Prince Namor. From there, he served as "boss" to the mercenary group [[Heroes for Hire]]. When the group disbanded, he went off on his own, reappearing again as the head of another superteam, the [[V Battalion]].
