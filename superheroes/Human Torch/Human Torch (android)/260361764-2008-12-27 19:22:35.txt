The '''Human Torch''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]]-owned [[superhero]]. Created by writer-artist [[Carl Burgos]], he [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 ([[1939#October|October 1939]]), published by Marvel's predecessor, [[Timely Comics]].

The "Human" Torch was actually an [[android]] created by [[scientist]] [[Phineas Horton]]. He possessed the ability to surround himself with fire and control flames. In his earliest appearances, he was portrayed as a [[science fiction]] monstrosity, but quickly became a hero. 

The Human Torch was one of Timely Comics' three signature characters, along with [[Captain America]] and [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner. Like many superheroes, the Human Torch fell into obscurity by the 1950s. In 1961, Marvel recycled his name and powers into a [[Human Torch|new, unrelated Human Torch]], a member of the [[Fantastic Four]] (who, among other things, actually was human). Unlike Captain America and the Sub-Mariner, the original Human Torch has had only a small presence in the post-1950s Marvel [[comic books]] and is closely associated with the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]].

==Publication history==
Following his debut in the hit ''Marvel Comics'' #1,<ref>Per researcher Keif Fromm in ''Alter Ego'' #49, p. 4 (caption), that initial comic, cover-dated October 1939, quickly sold out 80,000 copies. Goodman immediately produced a second printing, cover-dated November 1939 and identical except for a black bar in the inside-front-cover indicia over the October date, and the November date added at the end. That sold approximately 800,000 copies.</ref> the Human Torch proved popular enough that he soon became one of the first superheroes to headline a solo title. Through the 1940s, the Torch starred or was featured in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' (the book's title beginning with issue #2), ''The Human Torch'' (premiering with issue #2, Fall 1940, having taken over the numbering of the defunct ''[[Red Raven|Red Raven Comics]]''), and ''[[Captain America|Captain America Comics]]'' #19, 21-67, 69, 76 & 77, as well as appearing in several issues of ''[[All Select Comics]]'', ''[[All Winners Comics]]'',  ''[[Daring Comics]]'', ''[[Mystic Comics]]'', and ''[[Young Allies|Young Allies Comics]]''.

Seeing a natural "fire and water" theme, Timely was responsible for comic books' first major [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], with a two-issue battle between the Human Torch and the [[Sub-Mariner]] that spanned ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #8-9 — telling the same story from the two characters' different perspectives.

''Marvel Mystery Comics'' ended its run with #92 (June 1949), and ''The Human Torch'' with #35 (March 1949), as superheroes in general faded in popularity. Timely Comics publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] — who by the early 1950s had transitioned the company to its next iteration, as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] — attempted to revive superheroes with the [[anthology]] comic ''Young Men'' #24-28 (Dec. 1953 - June 1954), starring the Human Torch (art by [[Syd Shores]] and [[Dick Ayers]], variously, with covers and initially some panels featuring the Torch redrawn by Burgos for style consistency), along with the Sub-Mariner and [[Captain America]]. The solo title ''The Human Torch'' returned for issues #36-38 (April-Aug. 1954) before again being canceled. The Torch also appeared in stories in the briefly revived ''Captain America Comics'' and ''Sub-Mariner Comics'', and in the anthology ''Men's Adventures'' #28 (July 1954).

The original Human Torch debuted in present-day Marvel Comics continuity in [[Fantastic Four|''Fantastic Four Annual'']] #4 (Nov. 1966).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
The  Human Torch was an [[android]] created by Professor [[Phineas Horton|Phineas T. Horton]] in his lab in [[Brooklyn, New York]] for scientific purposes. At a press-conference unveiling, however, Horton's creation burst into flames when exposed to [[oxygen]], and, with human-like sentience, personality, and awareness, rebelled against his creator. Public outcry led to the Torch being sealed in concrete, though he escaped due to a crack that let oxygen seep in.  While the Torch then inadvertently caused parts of [[New York City]] to burn, he eventually learned to control his flame and vowed to help humanity.<ref>''Marvel Comics'' #1</ref>

The Torch later first encountered and battled [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]].<ref>''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #8-10</ref>

He would join other heroes as war broke out in Europe, and later in the Pacific, to fight the [[Axis powers]]. In his solo title's debut issue, he acquired a young partner, Thomas "[[Toro (comics)|Toro]]" Raymond, the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of two nuclear scientists whose exposure to [[radiation]] gave him the ability to control fire.<ref>''Human Torch'' #1</ref> The Human Torch also joined the New York City police force as part of his "human cover" under the name James "Jim" Hammond. He would later drop the human name and serve the police force outright as the Human Torch, fighting villains and his off-and-on foe, the Sub-Mariner.

Both the Torch and the Sub-Mariner joined with Captain America and his partner [[Bucky]] as the core of the superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], fighting [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]] (in [[retcon]] stories that premiered in 1970s comics).<ref>''Giant-Size Invaders'' #1</ref> With the Invaders, he was soon brainwashed by the [[Red Skull]] and battled the [[Liberty Legion]].<ref>''Invaders'' Vol. 1 #5-6; ''Marvel Premiere'' #30</ref> He later gave a blood transfusion to Jacqueline Falsworth, giving her superhuman powers to become [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]].<ref>''Invaders'' Vol. 1 #11</ref>

The Torch, the Sub-Mariner, Captain America, and Bucky banded together with the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], and [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] in post-war America in a subsequent super-team, the [[All-Winners Squad]] (the original Captain America and Bucky's membership were later retconned as having been the second [[Spirit of '76 (comics)#Marvel Comics|Captain America]] and [[Bucky#Fred Davis - Late-WWII and post-war Bucky|Bucky]]).<ref>''All-Winners'' #19</ref> In Marvel continuity, the Human Torch was responsible for the death of Adolf Hitler. When the Russians were invading Berlin, the Torch and Toro broke into Hitler's bunker just as he was about to commit suicide, to offer him the chance to surrender himself to the Americans, rather than the Russians.  Hitler turned his pistol and opened fire. In return, the Human Torch blasted fire at Hitler, burning him alive.{{issue}}

Sometime afterward, the Torch was placed in deactivation sleep in the [[Mojave Desert]]; an [[atomic testing|atomic bomb test]] awoke him. Learning that Toro had been captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and brainwashed, the Torch rescued his old partner and learned that the nuclear bomb's radiation had made his powers both much stronger and more unstable.{{issue}}

In order to keep Toro a young boy, the writers [[retcon]]ned the character slightly, claiming the Torch met Toro after World War II rather than at the beginning.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} The revival lasted five issues. Later writers explained how fearing he would become a danger to those around him, the Torch flew back out into the desert and went nova, using up his energy reserve and effectively deactivating himself.{{issue}}

===Present-day===
In modern-day continuity, the supervillain the [[Mad Thinker]] reactivated the Torch to have him battle the [[Fantastic Four]], deactivating him <!--not destroyed; body was shown to be intact-->when the Torch refused to kill the heroes.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #4</ref> A storyline in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], dealing with the secret background of its [[android]] member, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], gradually revealed that the Torch's body had been found by a renegade robot named [[Ultron|Ultron 5]] and modified to become the Vision, his mind wiped of past memories and his powers altered with the coerced help of the Human Torch's original creator, Phineas Horton. The seed of this idea was planted by artist [[Neal Adams]] and worked out in detail in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #133-135 by writer [[Steve Englehart]].

A later story by [[Roy Thomas]] in ''What If?'' Vol. 1, #4 (Aug. 1977), planted the suggestion that the Vision was actually made from a second android created by Horton, named [[Adam II]]. This freed up the Human Torch for a possible revival. This was followed up by [[John Byrne]], who had the [[Scarlet Witch]] revive the Torch in ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'', seeking answers about her husband, the Vision, and to help Ann Raymond, wife of Tom "[[Toro (comics)|Toro]]" Raymond. The Torch served the Avengers for many issues before losing his powers to save the former superheroine [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] in the 1990s series ''[[Namor]]''. His powers gone, the Torch settled down with Ann Raymond.

He became the Chief of Security for Oracle, Inc., and would appear later as the CEO of Oracle, Inc., a company run by Namor. There he ran the mercenary team [[Heroes for Hire]], and his mysterious connection to the Vision was furthered when [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] (Scott Lang) discovered that his internal mechanisms were not merely similar, but ''identical'' to the Vision's. During a time-travel adventure, the Avengers subsequently discovered [[Immortus]], the custodian of Limbo, had used a device called the Forever Crystal to  diverge the Torch's personal timeline while keeping the two outcomes concurrent. Hence, the Human Torch ''is'' the Vision, but also continues to exist as himself.

When Oracle Inc. was closed down and Heroes for Hire disbanded, Hammond was soon asked to head [[Citizen V]]'s V-Battalion upon the retirement of [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Roger Aubrey]], the [[Destroyer (Golden Age)|Destroyer]]. While on leave from the V-Battalion as field leader of the [[Invaders (comics)|New Invaders]], he became attached to [[Tara (comics)|Tara]], a female android based on him, whom he came to regard as a daughter of sorts. He also renewed acquaintances with Spitfire, to the dismay of her beau, [[Union Jack (comics)#Union Jack III|Union Jack]] (Joey Chapman). Tara was revealed to have been created by the [[Red Skull]]; overrides on her developing personality allowed the Invaders' enemies, the Axis Mundi, to use her as a weapon against the team. As Tara heated toward overload to kill the Invaders, the Torch channeled her heat in order to prevent her meltdown. With his own systems then overloading, he flew high into the atmosphere, away from where he could cause harm, and detonated.

The superhuman training camp created in the aftermath of the Civil War is named Camp Hammond, in the Torch's honor. A statue of Hammond on the grounds bears the inscription "JIM HAMMOND, THE FIRST OF THE MARVELS: He showed us that heroes can be made".<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 (June 2007)</ref>

===Avengers/Invaders===
The original Human Torch appears in the ''Avengers/Invaders'' maxi-series alongside his fellow Invaders when an incident takes them from the battlefields of [[World War II]] to the present [[Marvel Universe]], where they encounter both the [[New Avengers (comics)|New]] and [[Mighty Avengers]]<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=8652 AVENGERS/INVADERS #1 - Marvel Comics Publishing Catalog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

==Physiology==
Earlier writers portrayed the Torch's body as anatomically identical to human, but made out of synthetic materials (such as ceramic bone).  Correspondingly, the Torch was shown to have human needs and human weaknesses; he has been felled by drugs, poison gas, and telepathic attacks in both Golden-Age stories and the [[Invaders]] series from the 1970s.  The Torch has also been shown sleeping, eating, and drinking on more than one occasion.

After the Mad Thinker's reactivation of the Torch, writers began to portray him as clearly mechanical, containing circuits, relays, and motors, much like a traditional robot.  The reconciliation of these two different interpretations of the Torch's physiology remains an unresolved issue. 

Of particular note is the Torch's synthetic blood, which in addition to being a [[Blood type#Universal donors and universal recipients|universal blood type]] has been shown to have remarkable restorative properties:

* A [[blood transfusion|"blood" transfusion]] gave [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] her superspeed powers, and a second transfusion decades later saved her life and restored her youth.  Aware of this transformation, the [[Hyena (Marvel Comics)|Hyena]] obtained a blood specimen from the Torch in the hopes of creating an army of Nazi speedsters.  A similar transfusion to [[Warrior Woman]] reversed much of her brain damage and restored her health and power. 
* While traveling inside The Human Torch in miniaturized form, [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] temporarily gained a version of the Torch's powers after coming in contact with one of the cells that powers the Torch (a homage to a similar incident in which [[Henry Pym]] entered the Vision's body and was temporarily rendered intangible).
* The [[Pyronano]]s, a type of [[nanomachine]]-based artificial beings, were created using cells secretly extracted from Jim Hammond.

==Powers and abilities==
The Human Torch is a synthetic being designed and constructed of artificial materials.  He has the capacity for creative intelligence, unlimited self-motivated activity, and human-like emotions. The Torch has the ability to envelop his body in fiery plasma without harm to himself and to utilize this heat energy for various effects, including flight, formation of fiery shapes, energy releases in the form of heat blasts, "nova flame bursts" (highest intensity heat blasts, similar to the heat-pulse of a nuclear warhead), and concussive force blasts. He is also immune to the effects of heat and flames not of his own creation. The Torch has the ability to control ambient heat energy in his immediate environment, allowing him to take control of flames not of his own generation and to absorb heat from outside sources. The Torch's flame can be extinguished by lack of oxygen, or by smothering materials such as water, sand, fire-fighting foam, or heat-resistant blankets unless his flame is at such intensity that it immediately vaporizes such materials on contact.

While in flame form, the original Human Torch has engaged in hand to hand combat with Namor the Sub-Mariner. He has also dug underground and through vessels like a human missile.

The upper limit of his resistance has been undefined over the years, having once walked out stronger when he was considered destroyed by a nuclear blast, in the last issue of New Invaders.

The Torch has received some training in unarmed combat by [[Captain America]], and is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers. The Torch is also an accomplished street fighter.

==Other media==
===''Fantastic Four'' TV Series===

This Human Torch was mentioned in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "When Calls Galactus" when [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] found out why [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Frankie]] had Johnny Storm's powers.
