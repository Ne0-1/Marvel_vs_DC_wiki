The original '''Human Torch''' is a [[fictional character]] who was created in  by [[Carl Burgos]] for ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 (Oct. 1939), the first comic book from [[Timely Comics]], the 1940s predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]].

==In the Golden Age of comics==
Not to be confused with the later Human Torch ([[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], a member of the [[Fantastic Four]]), this Human Torch was an [[android]] created by Professor Phineas T. Horton for scientific purposes. At a press-conference unveiling, however, Horton's creation burst into flames when exposed to [[oxygen]], and, with human-like sentience, personality, and awareness, rebelled against his creator. Public outcry led to the Torch's being sealed in concrete, though he escaped due to a crack that let oxygen seep in.  While the Torch then inadverently caused parts of [[New York City]] to burn, he eventually learned to control his flame and vowed to help humanity.

The Human Torch was part of the first major [[fictional crossover|crossover]] in comic book history, a two-issue battle between the Torch and [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] that appeared in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #8-9.

He would join other heroes as war broke out in Europe, and later in the Pacific, to fight the [[Axis powers]]. Continuing to be featured in ''Marvel Mystery'', the Torch was also quickly spun-off into his own title, ''Human Torch Comics'' (no cover date, but premiering Fall 1940 with issue #2, having taken over the numbering of the unsuccessful ''Red Raven'' #1). In his first issue, he acquired a young partner, Thomas "[[Toro (comics)|Toro]]" Raymond. Toro was the [[mutant]] son of two nuclear scientists whose exposure to [[radiation]] gave him the ability to control fire. The Human Torch also joined the police force as part of his "human cover" under the name Jim Hammond. He would later drop the human name and serve the police force outright as the Human Torch, fighting villains and his off-and-on foe, the Sub-Mariner.

==1950s revival==
After appearing in a wide variety of comics during the 1940s, the Human Torch fell victim to a general slump in the superhero market and disappeared for most of the 1950s. He was revived during a short-lived attempt by [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], Marvel's 1950s predecessor, beginning with ''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953), which also brought back [[Captain America]] and the Sub-Mariner. 

Here, it was revealed that the Torch had been placed in deactivation sleep in the [[Mojave Desert]]; an [[atomic testing|atomic bomb test]] awoke him. Learning that Toro had been captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and brainwashed, the Torch rescued his old parnter and learned that the nuclear bomb's radiation had made his powers both much stronger and more unstable. After five issues, fearing he would become a danger to those around him, the Torch flew back out into the desert and went nova, using up his energy reserve and effectively deactivating himself. 

The Torch's stories during this period were mostly drawn by [[Dick Ayers]], though initially some panels featuring the Torch were redrawn by Burgos for style consistency.

==Present-day continuity==

The Torch was found by the [[Fantastic Four]] in ''The Fantastic Four Annual'' #4 (1966), having been reactivated by the [[Mad Thinker]] and then destroyed at his command when the Torch refused to kill the heroes.  A copy of his body was created by the [[time travel]]er [[Immortus]]; this copy was obtained by the villainous android [[Ultron]], who used it to create the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], an android who went on to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

The Torch would be revived one final time in [[John Byrne]]'s ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'' by the [[Scarlet Witch]] — who was searching for answers about her husband, the Vision — and Ann Raymond, wife of Tom "Toro" Raymond. He served the Avengers for many issues before losing his powers to save the former superheroine [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] in the pages of the 1990s series ''Namor''. His powers gone, he decided to settle down with Ann Raymond.

[[Image:newinvaders9.jpg|thumb|Cover to '''New Invaders #9'''. Art by C. P. Smith.]] He would appear later as the CEO of Oracle, Inc., a company run by Prince Namor. From there, he served as "boss" to the mercenary group [[Heroes for Hire]]. When the group disbanded, he went off on his own, before being asked to become the head of [[Citizen V]]'s [[V-Battalion]] upon the retirement of Roger Aubrey, the [[Destroyer (Golden Age)|Destroyer]].

{{spoiler}}

Recently, while on leave from the V-Battalion as field leader of the [[New Invaders]], he became attached to [[Tara (comics)|Tara]] a recently-constructed female android based on him, whom he came to regard as a daughter of sorts, and struck up a renewed acquaintance with Spitfire to the dismay of her beau (the current [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]), while beginning to show signs that his powers were regenerating.

Unfortunately, Tara was revealed to be a plant, created by the [[Red Skull]], with overrides on her developing personality allowing the Invaders' enemies, the [[Axis Mundi]], to use her as a weapon against the team. Refusing to believe that she was truly gone, he found himself able to flame on again, and tried to channel the heat from her system to shut her down before she overloaded and killed all the Invaders, herself included. While he was able to stop her meltdown, his own systems could not handle the sheer heat, and he flew high into the atmosphere before detonating.

==Amazing physiology==
Various parts of the Human Torch's anatomy have been used for some amazing things:

* A [[blood transfusion]] gave Spitfire her powers, and a second transfusion decades later saved her life and restored her youth
* When Travelling inside The Human Torch in miniturized form, [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] temporarily gained a version of the Torch's powers after coming in contact with one of the cells that powers the Torch (a homage to a similar incident where [[Henry Pym]] entered the Vision's body and was temporarily rendered intangible)
* The [[Pyronano]]s, a type of [[nanomachine]]-based [[robots]], were created using cells secretly extracted from Jim Hammond
