The '''Stranger''' is a [[Cosmic Beings|cosmic being]] in the fictional [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  He first appeared in ''[[X-Men|Uncanny X-Men]]'' #11 (May [[1965]]), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

Although he most often appears as a white-haired man and appears at various [[height]]s, he wields vast energy-manipulating powers and can travel through [[outer space|space]] unaided.  

==History==

All that is known about the Stranger has been related by the being himself.  He has in the past claimed to be the sole survivor of ''Gigantus'', a world or race comprised of a "billion billion" beings, but has since said that this wasn't true.

In his initial appearance, he was disgusted by the behavior of [[humanity]], but curious about human potential exemplified in [[mutant]]s.  He took [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] to his world, "Stranger's World", for further study.  They later escaped, and the Stranger's subsequent encounter with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and his [[alter ego]], Bruce Banner, convinced him that humanity had great potential for good and evil.  While continuing his cosmic studies, the Stranger has often intervened to protect humanity from various threats.

The Stranger's first act to benefit the people of [[Earth]] was his defeat of the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]], the [[gestalt]] of the Eternals, by compressing him into a lifeless [[microverse]].  Since then, he has largely conducted his own studies of the [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and intervenes whenever the subjects of that research are threatened.  In recent years, the Earth of the [[New Universe]] has been placed in orbit around the [[Stranger's Labworld]] by the [[Living Tribunal]].
