The '''Stranger''' is a [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] that appears in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]].  The Stranger first appears in ''[[X-Men|Uncanny X-Men]]'' #11 (vol. 1, May 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Stranger first visits Earth out of curiosity, and after an encounter with the mutant [[X-Men]] departs, taking the supervillain [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his servant [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] off-world for further study. <ref name="Uncanny X-Men vol. 1, #11">''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1, #11</ref> Soon after, Magneto escapes and returns to Earth, although is then recaptured by the Stranger. <ref>''Uncanny X-men'' vol. 1, #18</ref> Almost nothing is learned about the entity's motivations, which would become his trademark. The Stranger then becomes convinced that mankind is dangerous and sets out to destroy the Earth, but is dissuaded from this course of action by [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] and his alter-ego the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], <ref>''Tales To Astonish'' vol. 1, #89 - 90</ref> and later the cosmic being [[Silver Surfer]]. <ref name="Silver Surfer vol. 1, #4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 1, #4</ref>

The Stranger returns several years later to aid the [[Fantastic Four]] against the villain the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]]. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #113 - 116</ref>  He is later impersonated by the Toad, who battles the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #137 - 138</ref> The true Stranger encounters the [[Kree]] warrior [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]] <ref name="Captain Marvel vol. 1, #42">''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1, #42</ref> and later [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Gardener (comics)|Gardener]] when trying to obtain the [[Infinity Gems|Soul Gem]] from the corpse of [[Adam Warlock]]. The Stranger, however, recovers the [[Infinity Gem|Reality Gem]]. <ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 1, #55</ref> The Stranger then aids superhero team the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]] to contain a Null-Life bomb he left on Earth during the first encounter with the Silver Surfer. <ref>''Champions'' vol. 1, #12 - 13</ref> After enlisting the aid of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to fight against the threat of the Olympian god [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]], <ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #5 </ref> the Stranger is not seen for some time.

The Silver Surfer eventually encounters the Stranger once again, and questions him about his motivations and origins. The entity the [[Living Tribunal]] manifests, and claims that the Stranger could have represented its fourth face (each face signifies a different aspect of its being).<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31</ref>

The only other fact known about the Stranger is that he acquires sentient beings - unwillingly - from across the universe for his collection on "Labworld." Past specimens have included the sentient island [[Krakoa]], Magneto and the Toad, and the villains the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and [[Mercurio the 4-D Man]]. The hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] later frees many of the specimens. <ref>''Quasar'' #14-16 (Sep. 1990 - Nov. 1990))</ref>

The Stranger recently posed as the entity [[The Beyonder]] in the series ''[[Beyond!]]'' and captured several heroes and villains who were then manipulated into fighting each other for the purpose of study. <ref name="Beyond! #1 - 6 2006">''Beyond!'' #1 - 6 (2006)</ref>
