The '''Stranger''' is a [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] in the fictional [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  He first appeared in ''[[X-Men|Uncanny X-Men]]'' #11 (May [[1965]]), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

Although he most often appears as a white-haired middle-aged man and assumes various [[height]]s, he wields vast energy-manipulating powers and can travel through [[outer space|space]] unaided.  

==History==

All that is known about the Stranger has been related by the being himself.  He has in the past claimed to be the sole survivor of ''Gigantus'', a world or race composed of a "billion billion" beings, but has since said that this wasn't true. However, it is possible that the Stranger is in actuality a composite being, somehow composed of a 'billion billion beings'. This is substantiated by an incident occurring in the '[[Infinity Gauntlet]]' saga in which a panel depicts the Stranger being defeated by [[Thanos]] wielding the Infinity Gauntlet. When the Stranger is struck by a bolt of energy, the panel depicts him separating into a collection of different beings, akin to a [[wicker man]]. The same thing happened in ''What If? - v1. #32'', only here it was [[Korvac]] who did the same thing to the Stranger, with the same result.  It has also been claimed that he was offered the opportunity to become the fourth face of the [[Living Tribunal]] but refused.

In his initial appearance, the Stranger was disgusted by the behavior of [[humanity]], but curious about human potential exemplified in [[mutant]]s.  He took [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] to his world, "Stranger's World", for further study.  They later escaped, and the Stranger's subsequent encounter with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and his [[alter ego]], Bruce Banner, convinced him that humanity had great potential for good and evil.  While continuing his cosmic studies, the Stranger has often intervened to protect humanity from various threats.

The Stranger's first act to benefit the people of [[Earth]] was his defeat of the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]], the [[gestalt]] of the Eternals of another world, by compressing him into a lifeless [[microverse]].  Since then, he has largely conducted his own studies of the [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and intervenes whenever the subjects of that research are threatened.  In recent years, the Stranger became embroiled in conflict with [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] over the possession of the extradimensional [[Star Brand]], which ultimately resulted in the Earth of the [[New Universe]] being placed in orbit around his Labworld and sealed away from all contact by the [[Living Tribunal]].

===Beyond!===

The Stranger has since appeared in the ''Beyond!'' Miniseries, posing as [[The Beyonder]], kidnapping a small group of heroes and villains, and attempting to study them ander the facade of battle.

==Labworld==
The Stranger's Labworld is a large planet where The Stranger conducts his many experiments. Most of these experiments use unwilling sentients as test subjects.

Labworld's one known moon is the Earth of the New Universe.
