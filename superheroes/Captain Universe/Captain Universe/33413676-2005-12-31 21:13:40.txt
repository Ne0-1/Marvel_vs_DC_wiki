'''Captain Universe''' is a disembodied [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who was created by [[Bill Mantlo]], and first appeared in [[Micronauts]] #8.

The Uni-Power is an extra-dimensional force that possesses an individual (or on one occasion, twins) in a time of crisis, transforming that person into Captain Universe.  As Captain Universe, the transformed person typically retains his or her original personality and appearance, though with Captain Universe's costume and heroic traits superimposed over the original.  Captain Universe generally possesses [[superhuman]] strength, flight, [[X-ray]] vision, [[telekinesis]], enhanced senses, and a psychic awareness of imminent danger; when a person already possessing one or more of these abilities was transformed into Captain Universe, those abilities were amplified by a factor of fifty. Some manifesters of the Uni-Power have demonstrated other, less common abilities as well as failing to exhibit some of the more 'usual' powers. Possessing its own sentience, the Uni-Power can and will abandon a host if necessary, or if said host uses the granted abilities in a detrimental or criminal fashion.

The Uni-Power itself emanates from the Enigma Force, the exact nature of which, naturally, remains an enigma. It is believed, however, to be connected to the [[Microverse]], home of the [[Micronauts]]. The first Captain Universe was an astronaut, Captain Ray Coffin.  Although the Uni-Power typically empowers normal, non-super-powered humans, it has in the past empowered [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Man]], Commander Arcturus Rann of the Micronauts, a member of the alien [[Badoon]] race, and a [[dog]], among others.  Its counterparts in various [[alternate timeline]]s have also possessed [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Mar-Vell]] and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. At one time, there was a behind-the-scenes subplot involving The Uni-Power and the criminal known as The Psyco-Man, who was desperate to gather its power and defeat his old enemies, The Fantastic Four. Recently the character took a break from appearances in the [[Marvel Universe]] after the Fantastic Four Annual 2001, and cameos in the Universe X and Paradise X series (although during the break he appeared as various cards for the current Marvel VS. Trading Card Games). But in 2005 he returned, and a series of Captain Universe specials were published, in which the Uni-Power possesses various Marvel heroes: the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[X-23]], [[Daredevil]] (who regains his sight while possessed); the [[Invisible Woman]], [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]], Krosakis, the energy-consuming warlord; the [[Silver Surfer]], and finally, paraplegic War Veteran Gabriel Vargas, who will serve as Captain Universe to verify the identity of the Uni-Power's phantom assailant, who was responsible for its recent power loss.
