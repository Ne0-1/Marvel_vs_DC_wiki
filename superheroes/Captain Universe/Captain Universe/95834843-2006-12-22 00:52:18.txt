'''Captain Universe''' is a disembodied [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who was created by [[Bill Mantlo]], and first appeared in ''[[Micronauts]]'' #8.

==Fictional character history==
The Uni-Power is an extra-dimensional force that possesses an individual (or on one occasion, twins) in a time of crisis, transforming that person into Captain Universe.  As Captain Universe, the transformed person typically retains his or her original personality and appearance, though with Captain Universe's costume and heroic traits superimposed over the original.  Captain Universe generally possesses [[superhuman]] strength, flight, [[X-ray]] vision, [[telekinesis]], enhanced senses, and a psychic awareness of imminent danger; when a person already possessing one or more of these abilities was transformed into Captain Universe, those abilities were amplified by vast amounts.  Some manifesters of the Uni-Power have demonstrated other, less common abilities as well as failing to exhibit some of the more 'usual' powers.  Possessing its own sentience, the Uni-Power can and will abandon a host if necessary, or if said host uses the granted abilities in a detrimental or criminal fashion.

The Uni-Power itself emanates from the Enigma Force, the exact nature of which, naturally, remains an enigma.  It is believed, however, to be connected to the [[Microverse]], home of the [[Micronauts]].  The first Human Captain Universe was an astronaut, Captain Ray Coffin.  Although the Uni-Power typically empowers normal, non-super-powered humans, it has in the past empowered [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Man]], Commander Arcturus Rann of the Micronauts, a member of the alien [[Badoon]] race, a toddler, and a [[dog]], among others.  Its counterparts in various [[alternate timeline]]s have also possessed [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Mar-Vell]], a Doombot and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. Because of its never-ending supply of energy it has been the target of many individuals, terrorist groups and peacekeeping agencies such as [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], the [[Psycho-Man]], [[Doctor Doom]] and even S.H.I.E.L.D. In 2005, after a four year break from comic appearances, Captain Universe returned, and a series of Captain Universe specials were published, in which the Uni-Power possesses various Marvel heroes (the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]; [[X-23]]; [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who regained his sight while possessed; the [[Invisible Woman]]; [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]]; and the [[Silver Surfer]]); all in a mission to restore its power which has been severely weakend from a mysterious force eminating from the darkest corners of the Microverse. Using the copied powers of each hero, it took paraplegic war veteran Gabriel Vargas as its host to face the one responsible for its weakening.

Because of his ambiguous nature, Captain Universe was used in a promotion in the mid-1990s, with the claim that readers could have a comic about themselves made for a fee.  The comics were generally stock stories, with minor details (such as skin or hair color, key names or phrases, etc.) altered based on information provided by the reader. 

==Alternate versions==
===Captain Universe/Death's Head 3.0===
In one possible future of the Marvel Universe, AIM has examined the Uni-Power and attempted to duplicate it.  The duplicate, referred to as the 'Alias-Power', has the ability to animate the [[Death's Head]] 3.0 robot.  While resident in Death's Head, it took the form of a conscience.  On one occasion, when asked to rescue an evil scientist from a jail, it instead rescued a human rights activist.  When the robot killed a UN researcher, the Alias-Power brought him back to life.  The researcher then confronted the robot, forcing it to acknowledge the conscience.  Afterwards, Death's Head began working for the UN as an anti-terrorist hitman.

===Captain Universe of Earth-Set===
After finally freeing himself of a circular orbit in an imploding dimension the superhero known as Quasar returned to the site of a major battle between himself, Doctor Strange, The Thing, Thor and the evil Elder God Set. Shocked to find his comrades dead, Quasar screamed into the Heavens as a glowing red light consumed him. It changed him and infused him with the powers of Captain Universe. After merging the Uni-Power with his own Quantum Bands Quasar took Strange's Eye of Agamotto and left the imploding dimension. 

When he arrived most of the remaining human heroes had been murdered by either Set's fearsome power or the hands of his seven mind controlled brides. Quasar found The Silver Surfer attempting to keep the creature at bay but was knocked out in the process. Filled with an immeasurable amount of rage Quasar/Captain Universe summoned the Eye and pulled himself and Set into another dimension where they would do battle for all Eternity. Later on Quasar of Earth-616 viewed his counterpart facing Set.

===Captain Universe of Earth-What If Spider-Man had kept his Cosmic Powers?===
In one Alternate Universe; Peter Parker remained bounded to the Uni-Power after his battle with the Tri-Sentinel. After a series of "domino-effect" type events involving Doctor Doom, The Avengers and others; Captain Universe sacrificed itself to unify the world in perfect harmony. Nine Months Later, Captain Universe was reborn as this Earth's May Parker.

===Captain Universe of Earth-Law Enforcement Squad===
During the Abraxas Saga<ref>[[Fantastic Four]] Annual 2001</ref><ref>Fantastic Four vol. 3 #49</ref>, a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]-esque super heroes called the Law Enforcement Squad appeared in [[Earth 616]].  They were headed by a smart version of the [[Incredible Hulk|Hulk]] who was not Bruce Banner. Joining this strange version of the behemoth were the WWII-era heroes [[Red Raven]], [[Bucky|Bucky Barnes]], [[Namora]] and The [[Whizzer]] (Bob Frank).  Other members included a good version of the [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Richard Fisk|The Rose]], [[Doctor Druid]], [[Living Lightning]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] and surprisingly a Captain Universe. 

The details of this Captain Universe's identity were never revealed.  It is possible that The Uni-Power had reanimated a dead body to use for itself or had created its own so that it did not have to employ the services of others anymore.  During the battle that ensues between the L.E.S. and the Fantastic Four, Captain Universe and Dr. Druid gang up on Reed Richards, trying to defeat him quickly since he is the leader and the smartest. With only seconds to spare, Reed convinces Captain Universe that something is out of place. Captain Universe reveals to Druid that Reed is telling the truth, but before he can finish his sentence, Captain Universe is struck down by Nova.

Reed and Druid travel into a portal left by Captain Universe's "death" only to reveal that he is alive and well in the strange "in-between" that the two have entered.  Captain Universe takes the two heroes on a tour through the creation of the Mult-Eternity that ensures a boundless [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Captain Universe and the others enter 616's [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] where they find themselves transported away. Captain Universe has vanished and standing before them is a valley of dead [[Galactus]] beings with Abraxas standing in the center.  When Reed and Druid return, Captain Universe is nowhere to be found, but they are unable to learn anything as the L.E.S. vanish back to their native universe.  The mystery surrounding the whereabouts of this other Captain Universe was never revealed.  It is possible that he was simultaneously returned to his Earth behind the scenes just as the rest of his team was.

===Captain Universe of [[Earth X]]===
Captain Universe's history was relatively the same as it had been on Earth-616 up until the ''Infinity Gauntlet Saga'', where an unknown Captain Universe fought alongside Kismet, the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Comet Man]], [[Carol Danvers]], [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and [[Starlord]]. Years later Arcturus Rann died in a battle against the Psycho Man thus taking the Enigma Force with him. Captain Universe was transferred into the Kree superhero Mar-Vell and eventually became part of a completed Cosmic Conscience thus reviving the Perfect Knowledge from the Perfect Universe which had been destroyed billions of centuries earlier by The Celestials.
