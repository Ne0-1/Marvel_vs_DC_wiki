'''Captain Universe''' is a disembodied [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who was created by [[Bill Mantlo]], and first appeared in ''[[Micronauts]]'' vol. 1 #8.

==Publication history==
Captain Universe hosts have appeared in either special one-shots or short stories throughout the years initially in the first series of the ''Micronauts'' in 1979.
Appearing sporadically in the 1980s in lesser titles such as ''Marvel Spotlight'', ''Marvel Fanfare'', the Uni-Power/Captain Universes appeared infrequently in other titles, even appearing in the first Contest of Champions.
Their appearances became even scarcer in the 1990s, appearing in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''What If?'', ''Amazing Spider-Man'', ''Marvel Comics Presents'' and ''Cosmic Powers Unlimited''.  

Though in 1994 Captain Universe finally gained its first one-shot, coinciding with a promotion, with the claim that readers could have a comic about themselves made for a fee.  The comics were generally stock stories, with minor details (such as skin or hair color, key names or phrases, etc.) altered based on information provided by the reader.  Veterinary student Jeff Christiansen, who would later become the force behind the resurgence of the ''Official Handbooks of the Marvel Universe'' in the mid-2000s was made the official Captain Universe of the comic so that it could be considered an in-continuity comic.  The one-shot was titled ''X-Men/Captain Universe: Sleeping Giants''

In 2005, after a four year break from comic appearances, Captain Universe returned in the second series of ''Amazing Fantasy.''  Also in 2005, a series of one-shot specials linked together by the Uni-Power/Captain Universe were released featuring different characters from the Marvel Universe as the Uni-Power each imbues them with power of Captain Universe.  These titles were ''Captain Universe/Hulk'', ''Captain Universe/Daredevil'', ''Captain Universe/X-23'', ''Captain Universe/Invisible Woman'' and ''Captain Universe/Silver Surfer''.  The Uni-Power made a brief appearance in ''Nextwave'', he also made a "cameo" as Cosmic Spider-Man for the variant cover of ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #3 and played an important part in the [[Death's Head 3.0]] saga chronicled in Amazing Fantasy.

Captain Universe made his return alongside [[Star-Lord]], Bug from the [[Micronauts]], [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], [[Groot]], [[Rocket Raccoon]] and [[Deathcry]] in [[Annihilation Conquest]]: Star-Lord. In the series, he accidentally killed Deathcry when she attempted to kill him after he stole her kill.

==Fictional character biography==
The Uni-Power is an extra-dimensional force that possesses an individual (or on one occasion, twins) in a time of crisis, transforming that person into Captain Universe.  As Captain Universe, the transformed person typically retains his or her original personality and appearance, though with Captain Universe's costume and heroic traits superimposed over the original.  The Uni-Power itself emanates from the Enigma Force, the exact nature of which, naturally, remains an enigma.  It is believed, however, to be connected to the [[Microverse]], home of the [[Micronauts]].  Although the Uni-Power typically empowers normal, non-super-powered humans, it has in the past empowered [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Man]], Commander Arcturus Rann of the Micronauts, a toddler, and a dog, among others.  Its counterparts in various [[alternate timeline]]s have also possessed [[Mar-Vell]], [[Mr. Fantastic]], a member of the alien [[Badoon]] race, a Doombot and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. Because of its never-ending supply of energy it has been the target of many individuals, terrorist groups and peacekeeping agencies such as [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], the [[Psycho-Man]], [[Doctor Doom]] and even S.H.I.E.L.D. 

The first human Captain Universe was an astronaut, Captain Ray Coffin.  He battled [[Baron Karza]] and sealed the Prometheus Pit between the Microverse and Earth.<ref>''Micronauts'' Vol. 1 #8</ref> The Uni-Power next possessed his son Steve Coffin to battle Mister E and his shadow slaves.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 2 #10</ref> It next possessed Ann Stafford and Clare Dodgson to capture Nemesis,<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 2 #10</ref>and then possessed Monty Walsh to capture Guido Carboni.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 2 #11</ref> It then possessed Doctor Strange and Commander [[Arcturus Rann]] to reinforce the space-wall between the Microverse and the Macroverse.<ref>''Micronauts'' Vol. 1 #35</ref> It then possessed [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] for the first time, to defuse a nuclear missile, and wound up battling the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #10</ref> Captain Universe was then next among the heroes summoned by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] for the [[Contest of Champions]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Hero Contest of Champions'' #1</ref> The Captain Universe power next possessed Delayne Masters to defeat schoolyard bullies.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #25</ref> It then possessed Evan Swann to stop the [[Quantum Mechanic]] from destroying the Earth.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #5</ref>

When the Captain Universe power next appeared, it possessed Spider-Man in order to stop the [[Tri-Sentinel]].  The cosmic powered Spider-Man battled the [[Trapster]], [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Brothers Grimm (comics)#Second pair|Brothers Grimm]], [[Erik Josten|Goliath]], Hulk, [[TESS-One]], [[Dragon Man]], and the Tri-Sentinel itself.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #158-160; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #59-61; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #327-329; ''Quasar'' #7</ref> It next possessed Eddie Price to battle Gart and Rath.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #6</ref>

Captain Universe later returned, and the Uni-Power possesses various heroes (the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]; [[X-23]]; [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who regained his sight while possessed; the [[Invisible Woman]]; [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]; and the [[Silver Surfer]]); all in a mission to restore its power which has been severely weakened from a mysterious force emanating from the darkest corners of the Microverse. Using the copied powers of each hero, it took paraplegic war veteran Gabriel Vargas as its host to face the one responsible for its weakening. 

Recently the hero known as The Captain was drawn into a dark vision created by the Forbush Man. In this vision he had become Captain Universe but was catapulted to the other side of the Universe where another Earth existed. He learned that on this Earth everything that had ever gone right on our Earth had gone wrong here creating a world of chaos, anarchy, destruction and despair. The Heroes who lived here had become cold, cynical and hateful of Captain Universe because he was the only one who remembered what it was like to smile. Of course during his time on this Earth he became desperate to get home but found that getting from this Earth to his own would be impossible due to the sheer distance separating the two.

At some unknown point Captain Universe (Gabriel Vargas) is arrested by the Kree Government for accidentally attacking a group of Kree who were killing people who he thought were innocents but were actually sympathetic to the genocidal actions of the Annihilation Wave. For months he was studied by the Kree who, despite their highly advanced technology, could not learn much about the Uni-Power other than that the suit given to all users is actually a molecular shell and not spandex as was previously believed. Eventually Gabriel is released from prison and put into a highly aggressive session of training by the Kree Military as he and several other prisoners prepare for a mission that will halt the Phalanx's technophage virus from spreading further. It is not known if Gabriel and the Uni-Power ever determined the source of the Uni-Power's memory and power loss.

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Universe generally possesses [[superhuman]] strength, flight, Uni-Vision (microscopic vision, [[X-ray]] vision, and telescopic vision), [[telekinesis]], enhanced senses, and a psychic awareness of imminent danger; when a person already possessing one or more of these abilities was transformed into Captain Universe, those abilities were amplified by vast amounts.  Some manifestations of the Uni-Power have demonstrated other, less common abilities as well as failing to exhibit some of the more 'usual' powers, which vary in intensity with each wielder according to the strength and imagination of each.  Captain Universe usually possesses the ability of molecular rearrangement of organic and inorganic matter, transmutation of elements, the ability to fire bursts of energy and concussive force, hypnosis (using the Uni-Vision energy). Possessing its own sentience, the Uni-Power can and will abandon a host if necessary, or if said host uses the granted abilities in a detrimental or criminal fashion.

==Enemies==
Over the years the various incarnations of Captain Universe have faced many enemies from across the Marvel Universe. The most formidable of them have proven to be Baron Karza, Magneto, the Gray Hulk, Terminus, the Tri-Sentinel, Division U, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]]. 

==Other versions==
{{Citations missing|section|date=May 2007}}
===Captain Universe/Death's Head 3.0===
In one possible future of the Marvel Universe, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] has examined the Uni-Power and attempted to duplicate it.  The duplicate, referred to as the 'Alias-Power' or 'Uni-Alias', has the ability to animate the [[Death's Head]] 3.0 robot.  While resident in Death's Head, it took the form of a conscience.  On one occasion, when asked to rescue an evil scientist from a jail, it instead rescued a human rights activist.  When the robot killed a UN researcher, the power brought him back to life.  The researcher then confronted the robot, forcing it to acknowledge the conscience.  Afterwards, Death's Head began working for the UN as an anti-terrorist hit-man.<ref>''Amazing Fantasy'' #16-20</ref>

===The Captain Universe-Quasar composite entity of Earth-Set===
After finally freeing himself of a circular orbit in an imploding dimension the superhero known as Quasar returned to the site of a major battle between himself, Doctor Strange, The Thing, Thor and the evil Elder God Set. Shocked to find his comrades dead, Quasar screamed into the Heavens as a glowing red light consumed him. It changed him and infused him with the powers of Captain Universe. After merging the Uni-Power with his own Quantum Bands; Quasar took Doctor Strange's Eye of Agamotto and left the imploding dimension. 

When he arrived most of the remaining heroes had been murdered by either Set's fearsome power or at the hands of his seven mind controlled brides. Quasar found The Silver Surfer attempting to keep the creature at bay. Filled with an immeasurable amount of rage the Quasar/Captain Universe entity summoned the Eye of Agamotto and pulled himself and Set into the Eye's pocket dimension where they would do battle for all Eternity. Later on Quasar of Earth-616 viewed his counterpart facing Set.

===[[Spider-Ham]] becomes Captain Zooniverse===
Note: This is a real comic story not a prank and did actually happen in Marvel Tales #236. In the Larval Zooniverse, Peter Porker (who was secretly the superhero Spider-Ham) was working on an experiment that went awry and bestowed upon him the cosmic power of Captain Zooniverse. With this new power he defeated all of his enemies and trapped them in orbit around Earth. He returned home a bit later and began a new villain-free life with his girlfriend Mary Jane Waterbuffalo.

===What If Spider-Man had kept his Cosmic Powers?===
After his epic confrontation with the Tri-Sentinel; Peter Parker found that the Uni-Power had decided to remain with him. Essentially he had been chosen to become the permanent Captain Universe. After three hours of trying to figure out his situation he returned home to a startled Mary Jane who, after a lengthy explanation, came to terms with her husband having the power of a god. Days later he single-handedly thwarted [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]'s attempt to take hold of a near-infinite power source when he teamed up with The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. But nevertheless they still had their concerns as to whether or not the power of Captain Universe was corrupting his mind. Later on the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] attempted an assassination on [[Joe Robertson]] however he was confronted by Spider-Man who had found that his face had been given a demonic makeover. 

Deciding to fix the Hobgoblin's face, Spider-Man accidentally altered his face to that of his own, however thanks to a spell secretly unleashed onto the Hobgoblin by Doctor Strange he saw only the face of a demon. Horrified, the Hobgoblin ran off exclaiming that he would one day get revenge. After a party in Joe's honor Mary Jane warned Peter that the power of Captain Universe might be consuming him but Peter reassured her that Captain Universe was nothing like the [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]], who had attempted to take hold of his body not too long ago. Days later Venom issued a challenge to Spider-Man in Central Park. After flying around for a while Venom sneaked up on the cosmic-superhero and attempted to suffocate him under the symbiote's tendrils.

However Spider-Man was easily able to bring Venom up into space where unless he stopped his attack he would end up suffocating in orbit. Venom agreed and they returned to the park where Venom exclaimed that the symbiote upon feeling the mind of Captain Universe knew that Peter was no longer what he used to be and that only a trace of the man it once knew remained. Nevertheless Spider-Man decided to give Venom the chance to reform and take Spider-Man's place. Venom accepted and weeks later engaged the Hobgoblin in combat. During this time Spider-Man went on a "world tour" by cleaning up spilt oil from a [[Roxxon]] Tanker, saving a woman and her child from an earthquake, tossed nuclear waste into the Sun all the while Mary Jane felt neglected by her husband.

After his world tour ended he and Mary Jane visited Aunt May, however, Spider-Man sensed trouble within the Persian Gulf and descended upon the Middle East where he halted a massive war and disposed of a Middle Eastern tyrant. However because of his quick transformation into Captain Universe he caused Aunt May to collapse in utter shock. Mary Jane of course was furious with him for what he'd done but with his mind now one with Captain Universe he no longer cared for the well-being of either Aunt May or Mary Jane. Knowing it was over, Mary Jane left for her sisters all the while Spider-Man journeyed to the Avengers Headquarters.

Upon a short misunderstanding battle with Captain America and Thor; Spider-Man was able to convince Thor to come with him to Africa where they would re-enrich the land with nutrients and rain. Thor blatantly refused stating that Gods were not supposed to interfere with the daily affairs of humanity. Spider-Man became enraged and knocked Thor into space where shortly after another battle ensued. The two went at it for minutes until Spider-Man finally gained an upper hand on Thor and began to subdue him until an energy beam from another source knocked Thor out cold.

Wondering who fired that shot Spider-Man turned to see Doctor Doom holding a hostage who happened to be Captain Ray Coffin, the original Captain Universe. Doom announced that he would spare Coffin's life if Spider-Man rescinded the powers of Captain Universe to him. Spider-Man refused and attempted to stop Doom but the villain was able to fire his energy absorbing weapon and kill Coffin at the same time. Within seconds Spider-Man and Captain Universe split and appeared in the form of astral projections in Peter's mind where they had an ethical debate concerning Ray Coffin, Aunt May and Mary Jane. Captain Universe justified his means of sacrifice by announcing that The Needs of the Universe outweighed the Needs of the Few. Spider-Man rebutted with Uncle Ben's famous quote "That with Great Power comes Great Responsibility" but Captain Universe then bit back with "With Absolute Power one must take Absolute Responsibility for the World." Angered by this Spider-Man compared Captain Universe's cold, dispassionate view of the world with that of Dr. Doom's. 

In that instant while still vulnerable Captain Universe was captured by Dr. Doom and was transformed into what he had always hoped of being, a god. However he could not retain the power and it returned to Spider-Man who quickly realized that this Doom was an impostor, a Doombot. Making quick disposal of the robot Spider-Man realized that he could not be the only one to retain the powers of Captain Universe. Taking the weapon he poured its energy unto himself and almost immediately afterwards the whole world was unified by Captain Universe. Spider-Man awoke later powerless.

Months later, Peter and Mary Jane repaired their relationship and had a daughter who possessed both the powers of Spider-Man and Captain Universe.

===Captain Universe of the Law Enforcement Squad===
During the Abraxas Saga,<ref>[[Fantastic Four]] Annual 2001</ref><ref>Fantastic Four vol. 3 #49</ref> a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]-esque super heroes called the Law Enforcement Squad appeared in [[Earth 616]].  They were headed by an intelligent version of the [[Incredible Hulk|Hulk]] who was not Bruce Banner. Joining this strange version of the behemoth were the World War II-era heroes [[Red Raven]], [[Bucky|Bucky Barnes]], [[Namora]] and The [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer (Bob Frank)]].  Other members included a heroic version of the [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Richard Fisk|The Rose]], [[Doctor Druid]], [[Living Lightning]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] and a male Captain Universe.  (It should be noted that the membership of the Law Enforcement Squad paralleled the membership of [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice Society of America]].  Captain Universe was the equivalent of DC's [[Starman (comics)|Starman]]).

The true identity of this Captain Universe was never revealed but the host had more than likely had the Uni-Power for several years. During the battle that ensued between the Law Enforcement Squad and the Fantastic Four; Captain Universe and Dr. Druid ganged up on Reed Richards in order to destabilize the Fantastic Four's cohesion as a team. With only seconds to spare, Reed convinces Captain Universe that something is out of place and that the Fantastic Four are not his enemies. Captain Universe reveals to Druid that Reed is telling the truth, but before he can convince the others to stop fighting, he is struck down by Nova (Frankie Raye.)

Reed and Druid travel into a portal left by Captain Universe's "death" only to find him alive and well within the body of Earth 616's [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]. Captain Universe explains to the two superheroes of the creation of the Multi-Eternity that ensures a boundless [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Afterwards Captain Universe vanishes without a trace while Reed and Druid return to their respective realities after a confrontation with Abraxas, the antithesis of Eternity and Galactus.

===Captain Universe of [[Earth X]]===
Captain Universe's history was relatively the same as it had been on Earth-616 up until the ''Infinity Gauntlet Saga'', where an unknown Captain Universe fought alongside [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Comet Man]], [[Carol Danvers]], [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and [[Star-Lord]]. Years later Arcturus Rann died in a battle against the Psycho Man and took the Enigma Force with him to the afterlife. Captain Universe was transferred into the Kree superhero Mar-Vell and eventually became part of a completed Cosmic Conscience which revived the Perfect Knowledge of the Perfect Universe which had been destroyed countless millennia ago by The Celestials. Captain Universe later joined with Reed Richards to form the new Eternity. They were last seen preparing to save Franklin from The Celestials and The Elders of the Universe.

===Captain Universe of the 26th Century===
When The Guardians of the Galaxy traveled to the 26th century in order to stop the Badoon they had a large falling out. Vance Astro left the team and traveled to the 20th century where he trained with Captain America. Meanwhile Charlie-27, Nikki and Talon were forced to deal with The Badoon Emperor who challenged them to a "fair" fight. Nikki attempted to beam down and face the champion chosen by the Emperor but she was stopped by Charlie who took it upon himself to face the Badoon. However he was not prepared for the villain he was to face. Earlier on a Badoon worker named L'Matto was infused with the powers of the 26th Century counterpart to Captain Universe. 

With his immense power the villainous Captain Universe was able to overpower Charlie much to the dismay of his teammates. However the Badoon's winning streak was quickly circumvented by Vance, Dr. Strange (who had arrived from the 20th century) and Aleta who had become the new Starhawk. 
With L'Matto defeated by Aleta and Dr. Strange, Captain Universe was easily exorcised by the Doctor. To avoid returning to his time through the Dark Dimension of Dormammu, Dr. Strange used a modicum of Captain Universe's extra-dimensional abilities to travel through a series of ripples created by the Infinity War.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #30-33</ref>
