'''Captain Universe''' is a disembodied [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] created by [[Steve Ditko]].

The Uni-Power is an extra-dimensional force that possesses an individual in a time of crisis, transforming that person into Captain Universe.  As Captain Universe, the transformed person typically retains their original personality and appearance, though with Captain Universe's costume and heroic traits superimposed over the original.  Captain Universe possesses [[superhuman]] strength, flight, [[X-ray]] vision, [[telekinesis]], and a psychic awareness of imminent danger; when a person already possesing one or more of these abilities was transformed into Captain Universe, those abilities were greatly amplified.

The Uni-Power itself emenates from the Enigma Force, the exact nature of which, naturally, remains an enigma. It is believed, however to be connected to the [[Microverse]], home of the [[Micronauts]]. The first Captain Universe was an astronaut, Captain Ray Coffin.  Although the Uni-Power typically empowers normal, non-super-powered humans, it has in the past empowered [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Man]], Commander Arcturus Rann of the Micronauts, a member of the alien [[Badoon]] race, and a [[dog]], among others.  Its counterparts in various [[alternate timeline]]s have also possessed [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Mar-Vell]] and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].
