'''The Inferior Five''' (or I5) are a [[parody|parodical]] [[superhero]] team who premiered in the [[DC Comics]] test book ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]] Comics'' #62 ([[1966]].)  Created by E. Nelson Bridwell (writer), Joe Orlando and Mike Esposito (artists), they were intended not only as a parody of the [[Fantastic Four]], but of all the superhero teams whose members had such great powers that they could have solved any of the crimes put before them singlehandedly. The Five ''had'' to work as a team; none of them could have fought crime on their own.

The group consisted of the children of members of the [[Freedom Brigade]], a 40's and 50's hero group.

* '''Merry Man''' (Myron Victor), the son of The Patriot and Lady Liberty. He is a descendant of Yellowjacket and the Crimson Chrysanthemum (obvious takeoffs on the [[Green Hornet]] and the [[Scarlet Pimpernel]]).  He is a weakling in a [[jester]] outfit and leader of the group.
* '''Awkward Man''' (Leander Brent), son of Mr. Might and the Mermaid.  He is super-strong and able to live underwater but is also very clumsy.
* '''The Blimp''' (Herman Cramer), the overweight son of Captain Swift who could fly like his father but, as he lacked his father's speed powers, could only fly at super slow speeds.
* '''White Feather''' (William King), son of The Bowman and an unidentified woman. He was a superb archer when he didn't think anyone was watching; people made him nervous.
* '''Dumb Bunny''' (Athena Tremor), the stupid but super-strong daughter of Princess Power and related to Angel of the ''[[Angel and the Ape]]'' comic.

All the characters were sons or daughters of previous generations of heroes, and some of their names were takeoffs on those of popular DC characters. Merryman's appearance was specifically modeled on [[Woody Allen]]. 

Their own title lasted twelve issues. The first ten had new material and were published in the [[1960s]]. Eleven and twelve were published in the early [[1970s]] and were all reprints, except for new covers. In one memorable adventure, they met a group of what appeared to be Marvel superheroes, slightly changed to avoid copyright problems, and fought alongside them to repel an invasion of aliens with hypnotic eyes and garlic breath.

The Inferior Five changed its title to ''The New Inferior 5'' (using the number 5 rather than spelling out the word).  Nothing changed with the alteration of the title.  Afterwards they appeared sporadically after their own series was cancelled, most notably in ''Showcase Comics'' #100, one or two panels in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', and in a [[super hero]] [[limbo]] in the [[Grant Morrison]] written ''[[Animal Man]]'' series.

==Superior Five==

In the mini-series [[Villains United]] the Inferior Five were paid homage as a group of supervillains who are tentatively known as the Superior Five.  Each member has the abilities of an I5 member but, aside from being evil, are serious and modernly styled characters.  They consist of:

* '''Tremor''' (Awkward Man)
* '''Hindenburg''' (The Blimp)
* '''Splitshot''' (White Feather)
* '''Lagomorph''' (Dumb Bunny)
* '''Jongleur''' (Merry Man)

Little has been seen of these characters except for one panel in Villains United #4 and a few shots of them in the background in the same issue.  How they'll be used is not known but some speculate that their appearance will herald a return of the Inferior Five in one form or another.  

==Awards==
The series and characters have been recognized in the field, being awarded a 1966 Alley Award for Best Humor Title: Costumed.
