'''Wundarr the Aquarian''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Val Mayerik]] in [[Adventure into Fear]] #17. His first appearance is thought of as a [[parody]] of the origin of [[Superman]].

==Publication history==
Wundarr first appeared in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'', and before long he became a frequent [[supporting character]] in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]''.  After Gerber's run, he mostly disappeared until the [[Project Pegasus]] saga (written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]]),  in which he became "The Aquarian."

===Relaunch candidate===
In 2005, Marvel.com presented four characters to be relaunched.  The Aquarian was one of these choices and took second place to [[Death's Head]].  Steve Gerber asked his fans on the [[Howard the Duck]] [[Yahoo! Group]] to vote against a revival of the character, since he would have neither creative control nor receive financial compensation from such a relaunch.

== Fictional character biography ==
===Early years===
On a distant planet called Dakkam, a [[scientist]] named Hektu had come to believe that the sun going [[nova]] would destroy his world. In a last effort to save his family, he and his wife, Soja, had an infant son named Wundarr, whom they planned to save from their world's destruction.  They placed him aboard a ship that would maintain his [[Life support (aviation)|life support]] as long as necessary, and launched him into outer space.  Hektu and Soja later made flight and were captured and executed by the Internal Security Force to prevent them from alarming the populace. It would later be found out that Hektu's apocalyptic prediction was incorrect, and that he sent his son away for nothing.

In July, 1951, Wundarr's ship was caught by Earth's gravitational pull, and passed through a layer of [[cosmic rays]] before entering Earth's atmosphere, and crashing in a [[Florida]] [[swamp]].  An elderly couple known only as Maw and Paw observed the crash from their car.  Paw considered checking out the crash site, but Maw insisted that it might've contained [[Martian]]s or [[Communist]]s and demanded that he ignore it.(Maw and Paw being possible parodies of the couple that found the crashed Superman). He therefore stayed in the ship for a number of years, growing to physical maturity, though keeping the mind of a child.  Twenty years later, Wundarr was released, and the first creature he sees is [[Man-Thing]], which he is convinced is his mother.  He learns very quickly of his amazing strength, and bests Man-Thing in battle. Man-Thing's continued attempts to be left alone result in Wundarr eventually deciding that Man-Thing is not his mother.<ref>''Adventure into Fear'' #17</ref>

With his great leaping ability, he eventually reaches [[Hydro-Base|the base that once belonged to]] Dr. Hydro, where [[Namor]] and [[Namorita]] are trying to rehabilitate the population of [[Hydro-Men|transformed humans]].  Namor believes that he is a malicious intruder, and quickly scares him off.  Two Dakkam officials, Tuumar and Zeneg, despite their belief that Wundarr is stupid, believe that Wundarr may seek to avenge his father, and send a Mortoid robot to assassinate him.  Wundarr's leaps bring him down in [[New York City]], where he encounters [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] walking home from a screening of ''[[Five Fingers of Death]]''. Landing in the middle of traffic, Wundarr is hurt, and lashes back childishly, throwing the cars around.  Ben pulls no punches trying to stop him, but quickly realizes he is not dealing with a supervillain.  Namor and Namorita, having followed Wundarr, try to restrain Ben, which leads to [[fisticuffs]] between Namor and Ben.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #2, 4</ref>  Wundarr also found himself menaced by the [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]].<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #58</ref>

Tuumar and Zeneg use this as the opportunity to kill Wundarr "for tranquility".  When Ben and Namor team up and destroy the Mortoid, Tuumar and Zeneg flee, and Ben is left to be "Unca Benjy" to Wundarr, whom [[Reed Richards]] determines to be of high intellect, but with the knowledge and experience of a child. Reed built Wundarr a containment suit that enabled his body to expel small amounts of energy so that his body would not overload.

===The Aquarian===
Wundarr was captured by the [[Project Pegasus]] leaders in order to test his abilities. During these tests, the project leaders decided to use his energy-dampening abilities to probe the [[Cosmic Cube]], a device of great cosmic power. While probing, the Cosmic Cube overloaded Wundarr's mind and body, sending him into an autistic coma (though his energy-dampening field still functioned).<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #42</ref> This overload of energy greatly boosted his abilities, both mental and physical, giving him his power "dampening" ability.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #53</ref> Being in communication with the Cube, though for but a short time, he was granted great knowledge and a sense of purpose. He awoke from his coma, and was further transformed by the Cosmic Cube. In light of his new knowledge, renamed himself The Aquarian.  His new power allowed him to defeat the [[Nth Man (comics)|Nth Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #55-58</ref> Since then, he roams somewhat aimlessly, seeking to bring peace and enlightenment to the Earth.  For a time, he led the Water-Children, a philosophical cult dedicated to pacifism and awaiting the coming of the Celestial Messiah.

Aquarian served as a psychic "nesting place" for the Cosmic Cube, just before it awoke to sentience.<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #7</ref> Aquarian was attacked by fellow Dakkamite [[Quantum (comics)|Quantum]], but was saved by the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #4</ref> Aquarian also aided [[Doctor Strange]] in preventing planet-wide disasters on Earth.<ref>''Quasar'' #25, 28</ref>

===The Initiative===
Wundarr is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.

==Powers and abilities==
Exposure to cosmic rays granted superhuman powers to Wundarr, and radiation from the Earth's sun causes all Dakkamites to undergo further mutagenic effects.

Initially, Wundarr could absorb energy directly into his body. This energy was converted into kinetic energy which could be used to increase his physical strength (allowing him to bench up to 15 tons), in leaping, or in energy projection. To keep him from building up more energy than his body could handle, Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four built him a suit that would allow him to "drain" the energy in his body.

After the exposure to the energies of the Cosmic Cube, the Aquarian could create a field around his body that nullified nearly all forms of energy (kinetic, electrical, magnetic, gamma, gravitational, etc.) that are higher than a certain preset level, which he called his "null field". For example, a bullet contains a level of kinetic energy higher than what his Null field will allow for, so once the bullet enters his field, its energy is nullified. His own body is subject to this field, and he cannot move any faster than it will allow. This field naturally resides five feet from his body, and he can never disable it. With concentration, however, he can contract this field to within five inches, or expand it to 500 feet.

*Physical strength - He has a great deal of physical strength, as shown in his besting of Man-Thing in battle. After his confrontation with the Cosmic Cube, his strength was lowered to the point of benching 1 ton.

*Leaping/flying - Wundarr has the ability to leap great distances. After his contact with The Cosmic Cube, however, his Null field negated any energy from leaping. However, since his Null field can negate gravity and wind, he can literally walk on air, via directed motion hovering.

*Knowledge - After being in contact with the Cosmic Cube, he is left with an unimaginable knowledge which he calls "Everything and Nothing". He appears to have strong grasp on the properties of life and death, as well as peace and discourse. He is sometimes shown transmitting (through touch) this knowledge to other beings, often in order to create harmony.
