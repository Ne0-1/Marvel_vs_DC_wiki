'''Wundarr the Aquarian''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Val Mayerik]] in [[Adventure into Fear]] #17.

His first appearance [[parody|parodied]] the origin of [[Superman]].  Hektu, a [[scientist]] on the planet Dakkam, believed that their world was going to be destroyed by their sun going [[nova]].  He and his wife, Soja, have an infant son named Wundarr.  They placed him aboard a ship that would maintain his [[Life support (aviation)|life support]] as long as necessary and launched him into outer space.  Hektu and Soja later made flight and were captured and executed by the Internal Security Force to prevent them from alarming the populace.

In July, 1951, the ship crashed in a [[Florida]] [[swamp]].  An elderly couple known only as Maw and Paw observed the crash from their car.  Paw considers checking out the crash site, but Maw insists that it may contain [[Martian]]s or [[Communist]]s, so he had better ignore it, so he does.  Twenty years later, Wundarr is released, and the first creature he sees is [[Man-Thing]], which he is convinced is his mother.  He learns very quickly he has amazing strength and can best Man-Thing in battle, and Man-Thing's continued attempts to be left alone result in Wundarr eventually deciding that Man-Thing is not his mother.

With his great leaping ability, he eventually reaches the base that once belonged to [[Dr. Hydro]], where [[Namor]] and [[Namorita]] are trying to rehabilitate the population of transformed humans.  Namor believes that he is a malicious intruder, and quickly scares him off.  Two Dakkam officials, Tuumar and Zeneg, despite their belief that Wundarr is stupid, believe that Wundarr may seek to avenge his father, and send a Mortoid robot to assassinate him.  Wundarr's leaps bring him down in [[New York City]], where he encounters [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], walking home from a screening of ''[[Five Fingers of Death]]'' after being abandoned by [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] choosing to fly home while Ben contemplates his own first meeting with Man-Thing, as well as his [[alter ego]], the man Ted Sallis.  Landing in the middle of traffic, Wundarr is hurt, and lashes back as a child, throwing the cars around.  Ben pulls no punches trying to stop him, but quickly realizes he is not dealing with a supervillain.  Namor and Namorita have followed Wundarr and try to restrain Ben, which leads to [[fisticuffs]] between Namor and Ben.

Tuumar and Zeneg use this as the opportunity to kill Wundarr "for tranquility".  When Ben and Namor team up and destroy the Mortoid, Tuumar and Zeneg flee, and Ben is left to be "Unca Benjy" to Wundarr, whom [[Reed Richards]] determines to be of high intellect, but with the knowledge and experience of a child.

==The Aquarian==
Wundarr became the Aquarian during the [[Project Pegasus]] saga (written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]]), in which he was captured by the project in order to test his abilities.  He became the Aquarian in issue #58 of ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', the comic in which he had frequently been a [[supporting character]].

==Relaunch candidate==
In 2005, [[Marvel.com]] presented four characters to be relaunched.  The Aquarian was one of these choices and took second place to [[Death's Head]].  Steve Gerber asked his fans on the [[Howard the Duck]] [[Yahoo! Group]] to vote against a revival of the character, since he would have neither [[creative control]] nor receive [[financial compensation]] from such a relaunch.
