==Fictional character biography==
Howard Anthony Walter Stark was a brilliant inventor throughout his life. He and his father '''Howard Stark Sr.''' worked on various projects, and later founded [[Stark Industries]]. Throughout his young adulthood, Stark worked on various government projects dating back to the [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] era, like the World War I [[Captain America]] project with John Crowe Ransom, which came to completion during World War II; the World War II [[Manhattan Project]]; and the "[[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]]" robots, hidden in a subbasement in his mansion. The robots were only supposed to be activated if the US was overrun during a presumed [[Cold War]] conflict (but both known models have been accidentally awakened and stopped by [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]]). During the 1950s, Howard Stark was an agent of the secret science organization known as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|The Shield]], partnered with [[Nathaniel Richards]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Howard married [[Maria Collins Carbonell]] and together they had a son: Anthony "Tony" Stark. He constantly pushed Tony to be the best, telling him that someone must have "iron in their backbone" to be successful. Behind his heroic facade, however, he was an [[alcoholic]] who had a strained relationship with his son; in ''Iron Man 2'', Tony says, "My father never told me he loved me &mdash; he never even told me he ''liked'' me." Due to his power as a businessman, he was offered membership to the exclusive [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], but it seems Stark was uninterested in anything other than the lavish parties the club threw. It is believed Stark was also a member of the [[V-Battalion]]. He was targeted by the [[Red Skull]] (Johann Schmidt), and is rumored to have met the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], [[Uatu]]. Stark also prevented [[Obadiah Stane]] from taking control of Stark Industries at least once.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

On the [[Ides of March]], Howard and Maria were killed in a plane accident. It has been hinted that the incident was not random and possibly arranged by the V-Battalion, but this has never been confirmed. Tony ran his father's company, started a charity in his mother's name, and later became [[Iron Man]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the [[House of M]], Howard was alive while Maria's status is unknown. Howard turned over control of the company to Tony when he turned sixteen. Although officially listed as retired, he worked with Tony to build an armor capable of taking on the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and powerful [[mutants]] during the conflict.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

They began to work on Sentinels with Forge and [[Beast (comics)|Henry McCoy]] after being awarded them an exclusive contract. They planned to incorporate a "Vision Project", although there were problems with the control scheme. The two also competed on the wildly popular 'Sapien Deathmatch' television show.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

When Tony investigated a resistance group as Iron Man, Sentinels attacked. One, remotely controlled by Howard, scolded him for getting involved. Howard was secretly plotting against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] with Hank Pym.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

"Genome bomb" locations were discovered by Tony as Iron Man and the House was notified. Howard had programmed the Visions and Sentinels to serve him. He said this had all been part of a plan to make the mutants respect Tony for saving them. Tony would then use that as a chance to directly strike against Magneto. Tony refused to go along. Magneto suddenly appeared and personally dealt with Howard, killing him.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Ultimate Howard Stark===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Howard Stark starts off with [[Maria Cerrera]] (his second wife), a brilliant scientist suffered a genetic accident while she was pregnant. After Maria died during childbirth, Howard uses a newly invented biological armor to save the life of their son: [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Antonio "Tony" Stark]]. A few years later, [[Zebediah Stane]] (Stark's business rival) kidnaps and tortures young Tony to attempt to learn how to manufacture the bio-armor for his own personal gain. Not long afterwards, Howard arrives with a SWAT team and arrests Zebediah. After the incident, a transparent version of the armor is developed, and Tony begins attending a prep school. Fast forward to an older Tony who develops a prototype power-armor and befriends [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], a fellow student.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After finding out that bullies were ordered from an unknown individual to kill Tony, Howard decides to enroll Tony, Rhodes, and Nifara, who witnessed the attack, into the Baxter Building also enrolled [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] (Zebediah Stane's son) in the school. Shortly after their arrival, Tony and Howard witness Obadiah murder a pair of students and make it look like an accident. Howard witnesses Tony makes his first "Iron Man" armor with the intent to punish Obadiah.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Sometime later, Stark was arrested, based on planted evidence, (by Obadiah) for the gruesome murder of Zebediah Stane. While the elder Stark was wrongly imprisoned for the murder of Zebediah Stane, the teenage Stark is forced to run Stark Enterprises. Obadiah drugs a prison guard with a "hypnotizing bio-drug", and the guard tries to kill Howard. He fails, but Howard was shot in the process and ends up in ICU.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

While his son Tony is trying to fix all of his current problems, Howard is recovered enough to go to prison, but the guards sent to escort him were not sent by the Police Department. Howard fights them off and escapes. Tony meets with him, and says that he thinks [[Loni Stark/Loni Stane|Loni]] (Howard's first wife and Obadiah's mother) is the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them all. Iron Man, War Machine, Nifara, Howard, and Obadiah set off to Utah to find Loni. They arrive and their chopper explodes injuring War Machine. Obadiah falls off a cliff, but Iron Man catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Iron man flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni and their hideout. Iron Man breaks into the compound and Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Iron Man saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After Loni shoots and kills Nifara, she confesses that all she ever wanted was power, hence why she married Howard, divorced Howard, remarried with Zebediah, had Obadiah, AND later had Zebediah killed.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Iron Man shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. Tony takes off his armor, and Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to his father. Obadiah, mad that his mom abandoned him for dead with the poison gas, enters the room and kills her. Tony, Obadiah, and Howard are all picked up by the feds and go home.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Ultimate Howard Stark's true history has yet to be revealed as facts about his life which were depicted in the ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' series have been [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] as an in-universe fictional TV show about Iron Man's life.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The real history of Howard Stark is told in Ultimate Comics: Iron Man. Here is seen as the founder of Stark Enterprises. While Tony is trying to start a company of his own along with his then girlfriend, Howard continually tries to persuade to take his place as the CEO, which he eventually does.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

====Howard Stark Sr.====
The retconned Ultimate Marvel shows '''Howard Stark Sr.''' in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]''. He is the one who hired [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|a thief named "The Ghost"]] to steal [[Stark Industries]]'s covert tech piece "Remnant 242".<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #1</ref> He sends his [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|ARSENAL cyborgs]] to kidnap [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]] and his cohort [[Justine Hammer]] to his base "Project Tomorrow", a former military area which specialized in Man/Machine fusion tech, were he reveals himself to be Tony's grandfather that was believed to be dead in his grandson's youth. The grandfather Stark's been trying to use his Grandson's armor tech to upgrade his rusted green, body armor to achieve immortality. Ghost gives the elderly Stark "Remnant 242", where it's revealed to be an alternate version of Tony, found dead in a barren wasteland (Earth-242) during Tony's research with [[Reed Richards]]. Tony explains that the head has advanced armor failsafes that kills technology, which sends out a massive pulse that kills Howard, Ghost, the ARSENAL drones, and unfortunately Justine.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars #4''</ref>

In his first (and only) appearance within any continuity of Marvel, the Man/Machine fusion appearance of Howard Sr. is a hybrid of [[Iron Monger]] and [[Titanium Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #3</ref>

In the [[Marvel Noir]] miniseries ''Iron Man Noir'', set in the 1930s, Howard Stark is believed to have been killed by Nazi agents.  It is eventually revealed that he was subjected to chemical brainwashing by the Nazis, and became [[Baron Zemo]].
