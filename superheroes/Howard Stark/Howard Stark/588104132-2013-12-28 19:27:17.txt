==Fictional character biography==
Howard Anthony Walter Stark was a brilliant inventor throughout his life. He and his father Howard Stark Sr. worked on various projects, and later founded [[Stark Industries]]. Throughout his young adulthood, Stark worked on various government projects dating back to the [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] era, like the World War I [[Captain America]] project with John Crowe Ransom, which came to completion during World War II; the World War II [[Manhattan Project]]; and the "[[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]]" robots, hidden in a subbasement in his mansion. The robots were only supposed to be activated if the US was overrun during a presumed [[Cold War]] conflict (but both known models have been accidentally awakened and stopped by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]). During the 1950s, Stark was an agent of the secret science organization known as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|The Shield]], partnered with [[Nathaniel Richards]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Stark married [[Maria Stark|Maria Collins Carbonell]] and together they had a son: [[Iron Man|Anthony "Tony" Stark]]. He constantly pushed Tony to be the best, telling him that someone must have "iron in their backbone" to be successful. Behind his heroic facade, however, he was an [[alcoholic]] who had a strained relationship with his son. Due to his power as a businessman, Howard was offered membership to the exclusive [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], but it seems Stark was uninterested in anything other than the lavish parties the club threw. It is believed Howard was also a member of the [[V-Battalion]]. He was targeted by the [[Red Skull]] (Johann Schmidt), and is rumored to have met the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], [[Uatu]]. Stark also prevented [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] from taking control of Stark Industries at least once.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

On the [[Ides of March]], Howard and Maria were killed in a car accident. It has been hinted that the incident was not random and possibly arranged by the V-Battalion, but this has never been confirmed; earlier indications were that the accident was caused by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Republic Oil]], but this is also unconfirmed.<ref>''Iron Man: The Iron Age'' #1-2 (Augustâ€“September 1998)</ref> Tony ran his father's company, started a charity in his mother's name, and later became [[Iron Man]].<ref>Tales of Suspense #39</ref>

When Iron Man was briefly trapped in Hell by [[Doctor Doom]],<ref>''Iron Man: Legacy of Doom'' #1</ref> Iron Man faced what appeared to be Howard Stark as one of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s torments with the spirit 'wearing' a demonic version of Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor|armor]] and taunting Iron Man about his emotional weaknesses, but rejected the spirit's reality when it claimed that he had been a disappointment to his mother as well, as whatever problems he had with his father, Iron Man knew that his mother loved him unconditionally.<ref>''Iron Man: Legacy of Doom'' #2</ref>

==Other versions==

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'', Howard Stark was alive while Maria Stark's status is unknown. Howard turned over control of the company to Tony Stark when he turned sixteen. Although officially listed as retired, he worked with Tony to build an armor capable of taking on the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and powerful [[mutants]] during the conflict.<ref name="House of M: Iron Man #1">''House of M: Iron Man'' #1</ref>

Howard and son Tony began to work on Sentinels with Forge and [[Beast (comics)|Henry McCoy]] after being awarded them an exclusive contract. They planned to incorporate a "Vision Project", although there were problems with the control scheme. The two also competed on the wildly popular 'Sapien Deathmatch' television show.<ref name="House of M: Iron Man #1"/>

When Tony investigated a resistance group as Iron Man, Sentinels attacked. One, remotely controlled by Howard Stark, scolded him for getting involved. Howard was secretly plotting against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] with Hank Pym.<ref>''House of M: Iron Man'' #2</ref>

"Genome bomb" locations were discovered by Tony as Iron Man and the House was notified. Howard had programmed the Visions and Sentinels to serve him. He said this had all been part of a plan to make the mutants respect Tony for saving them. Tony would then use that as a chance to directly strike against Magneto. Tony refused to go along. Magneto suddenly appeared and personally dealt with Howard, killing him.<ref>''House of M: Iron Man'' #3</ref>

===Ultimate Howard Stark===

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Howard Stark is shown dealing with his second wife [[Maria Stark|Maria Cerrera]] (a brilliant scientist) suffering a genetic accident while she was pregnant. After Maria died during childbirth, Howard uses a newly invented biological armor to save the life of their son: Antonio "Tony" Stark. A few years later, his business rival [[Zebediah Stane]] kidnaps and tortures Tony to attempt to learn how to manufacture the bio-armor for his own personal gain. Not long afterwards, Howard arrives with a SWAT team and arrests Zebediah. After the incident, a transparent version of the armor is developed, and Tony begins attending a prep school. Fast forward to Tony developing a prototype power-armor and befriends fellow student [[War Machine|James Rhodes]].<ref name="Ultimate Iron Man #2">''Ultimate Iron Man'' #2</ref>

After finding out that bullies were ordered from an unknown individual to kill Tony, Howard decides to enroll his son Tony, Rhodes, and Nifara into the Baxter Building also enrolled [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] (Zebediah Stane's son) in the school. Shortly after their arrival, Tony and Howard witness Obadiah murder a pair of students and make it look like an accident. Howard witnesses Tony makes his first Iron Man armor with the intent to punish Obadiah.<ref name="Ultimate Iron Man #2"/>

Sometime later, Howard was arrested based on planted evidence (by Obadiah) for Zebediah's murder. While the elder Stark was wrongly imprisoned for Zebediah's murder, his teenage son is forced to run Stark Enterprises. When Obadiah drugs a prison guard with a "hypnotizing bio-drug", the guard tries to kill Howard but fails albeit Howard was shot in the process and ends up in ICU.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #1</ref>

While his son Tony is trying to fix all of his current problems, Howard recovered enough to go to prison, but the guards sent to escort him were not sent by the Police Department. Howard fights them off and escapes. Tony meets with him and thinks [[Loni (Ultimate Iron Man)|Loni]] (Howard's first wife and Obadiah's mother) is the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them all. Tony, Rhodes, Nifara, Howard, and Obadiah set off to Utah to find Loni. They arrive and their chopper explodes injuring Rhodes. Obadiah falls off a cliff, but Tony catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Tony flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni Stark and their hideout. Tony breaks into the compound and Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Tony saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After Loni kills Nifara, she confesses to Howard that all she ever wanted was power, hence why she married Howard, divorced him, remarried with Zebediah, had Obadiah, and later had Zebediah killed.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #3</ref>

Tony shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. Tony takes off his Iron Man armor, and Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing that his entire body is a brain and will heal itself. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to his father. Obadiah, mad that his mom abandoned him for dead with the poison gas, enters the room and kills her. Tony, Obadiah and Howard are all picked up by the feds and go home.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man 2'' #5</ref>
