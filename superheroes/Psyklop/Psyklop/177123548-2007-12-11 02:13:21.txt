'''Psyklop''' is a fictional character created by [[Marvel Comics]] and a recurring foe of the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]].

== Fictional character biography ==

Psyklop was a member of an intelligent insectoid-humanoid race which evolved from insects and existed on Earth and dominated the planet in prehistoric times; during their time, Psyklop's race prospered, but they soon fell out of favor with their "Dark Gods", who they worshipped and were put into a state of hibernation. <ref> ''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #88 </ref>

Eons later, Psyklop was awakened by the Dark Gods, who charged him with the responsibility of finding a power source for them, if Psyklop did so, his race would be awakened and allowed to conquer the Earth. After covertly creating a voodoo-based cult in New Orleans, Psyklop discovered that the Hulk possessed the power he needed to energize the Dark Gods. Transporting the Hulk to his lair, Psyklop, explaining his origin and intentions to him, began the process of shrinking the Hulk to a size where his molecular structure could be examined better. Unfortunately, Psyklop lost track of the Hulk when he was distracted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who appeared, having traced Psyklop to his base. Battling the Avengers, Psyklop managed to blast them with a device that erased their memories and teleported them to a subway platform in New York.

Afterwards, Psyklop, after searching for the Hulk, found him in the sub-atomic world of [[K'ai]]. Still wanting to harness the power of the Hulk, Psyklop shrunk himself in size to capture him. Successfully obtaining the Hulk, Psyklop returned to his base with him, only to be violently pummeled by the Hulk. As the Hulk prepared to kill Psyklop, Psyklop himself was quickly transported away by the Dark Gods, who had decided to abandon him as an agent of theirs.

It was later revealed that Psyklop had been simply dumped on K'ai by the Dark Gods and was left with no way to return to his regular size.

While on K'ai, Psyklop began to form a plan, inspired by an incident caused by the Hulk, who had accidentally kicked K'ai while leaving the planet, causing chaotic earthquakes. Creating a large drilling device, Psyklop began to create catastrophic earthquakes on K'ai, telling the planet's inhabitants he would only stop his destruction if they worshipped him as a God; Psyklop also captured the spirits of those who died in his earthquakes, planning on giving the spirits to the Dark Gods as a power source, wanting to regain their favor.

The Hulk, wanting to face this "angry God" who threatened the inhabitants of K'ai, ventured to Psyklop's headquarters with [[Jarella]] to confront the God. After destroying a robotic sentinel at Psyklop's base, the Hulk was knocked unconscious by Psyklop, who blasted him with a large projectile weapon.

Restraining the Hulk, Psyklop began to taunt Jarella, only for the Hulk to escape. Having all his weaponry destroyed by the Hulk, Psyklop resorted to using his hypnotic powers against the Hulk, managing to brainwash him. Psyklop then sent the Hulk out to attack the inhabitants of K'ai who had begun to storm Psyklop's base. Unfortunately for Psyklop, the Hulk was returned to normal by several K'ai sorcerers and began to advance on Psyklop. Taking Jarella hostage, Psyklop panicked and began trying to hypnotize the Hulk again, only to fail. Advancing on Psyklop, Hulk smashed the ground hard enough to break the urn in which Psyklop kept the spirits he captured. Before he could react, Psyklop was consumed by the spirits freed from the urn; all that remained of Psyklop was a pile of ash on the ground. <ref> ''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2, #203 </ref>
