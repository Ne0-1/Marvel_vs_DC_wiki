'''Kiden Nixon''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Having witnessed the murder of her police officer father at a young age, Kiden Nixon grew to be a rebellious teenager, attending rave parties, taking drugs, and stealing to support her smoking habit.

Kiden has the ability to realign herself into a faster personal timestream, so as everyone else appears to be moving at such an incredible slow pace they seem virtually motionless. Her mutant power first manifested itself at school after she confronted student gang leader Hector. During their interaction, when Kiden shouted "Stop!" time stopped; when she tapped him, time was re-started, and his arm was broken. Seeking revenge, Hector later attempted to shoot Kiden, but she used her powers to evade the attack (and her teacher was wounded instead). 

Her mutant nature now publicly revealed, Kiden fled. For the next six months she lived [[barefoot]] on the streets while exploring her powers. At one point she spent four months in "no-time" during which only three days passed in the real world.

After seeing visions of her deceased father, whom she believed was trying to communicate with her, Kiden became involved with fellow runaway [[Catiana]] and the young [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] clone [[X-23]] in opposing pimp Zebra Daddy and his forces.

==Powers and abilities==
Kiden is a mutant who can realign herself into a faster timestream, altering her [[perception]]s so that events occurring in real time appear to be moving in slow motion and allowing her to move with relatively much greater velocity and force. She doesn't tire or require [[sustenance]] in this state.  She can spend months in what she terms "no time", while only a few days or more have passed in real time.

The power is usually verbally activated, when Kiden says "stop".  However, she is capable of exerting this power by sheer will alone. Sometimes, under stress, it happens without her control.

The only way Kiden knows how to return to the normal timestream is to make [[skin]]-to-skin contact with another person. Kiden can't come back to the normal timestream if she touches someone's clothing; she has to touch someone's skin or she's stuck in the faster timestream.  The person she touches is affected by the speeding time; an extreme amount of force is applied to him or her. For example, when she touches someone's arm, the speeding time causes it to break.
