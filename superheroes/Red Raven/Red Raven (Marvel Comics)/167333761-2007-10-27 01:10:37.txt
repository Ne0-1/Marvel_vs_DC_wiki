'''Red Raven''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Louis Cazeneuve]] in ''Red Raven Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1940), published by Marvel's predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

He is the first Timely/Marvel character to star in his own self-titled series, predating by several months ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #1 (March 1941).

==Publication history==
''Red Raven Comics'' was canceled after its premiere issue. Following his [[first appearance]], the character remained unused until for more than two decades before being revived in the modern day as an [[antagonist]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #44 (May 1968). The Red Raven then battled [[Namor, the Sub-Mariner]] in ''Sub-Mariner'' vol. 1, #26 (June 1970). Presumed dead, he returned in ''[[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'' vol. 3, #4 & 6, and guest-starred in ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #6-7 (Aug. - Sept. 2001) and ''The Order'' #2 (May 2002).

In ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #29 (April 1976), Red Raven was [[retconned]] to have been a member of the stateside [[World War II]]-era superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]]. In that capacity he and his teammates guest-starred in ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]] Annual'' #1 (1976) and ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #6 (May 1976). He appeared in flashback cameos and the like in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Annual'' #12 (1984), ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #405 (Oct. 1995).

==Fictional character biography==
The boy who would become Red Raven was a child from [[Europe]] and the only survivor of a [[Atlantic Ocean|trans-Atlantic]] [[airplane]] crash. As an infant, he was adopted by a civilization of winged people who lived on a floating island in the sky, one kept aloft by [[antigravity]] drives and hidden from human civilization by artificial clouds. As he grew, he learned they were a tribe of avian [[Inhumans]] who had left the hidden Inhuman city [[Attilan]], built their own abode, and learned to stabilize their genetics to reproduce only in this winged form. Calling themselves both The Bird-People and The Winged Ones, they made their adopted son a uniform outfitted with anti-[[gravitons]] for flight and metal wings for navigation. During [[World War II]], fearing an escalation of [[Nazi Germany]]'s efforts that would encompasses his adopted people, the now-grown human wore a costume with large metal wings that enabled him to fly, and called himself Red Raven and joined the [[United States]] superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]].

The Bird-People, however, planned to invade human civilization after the war. Red Raven foiled their plot by using gas to place the tribe, including himself, in [[suspended animation]], and sank their domed island to the bottom of the ocean, setting a timer to return them to the surface and reawaken them after several years. When the island eventually resurfaced near the end of the suspended-animation cycle the [[X-Men]] superhero [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] stumbled upon the island. Angel and Red Raven clashed when the latter was startled by the former. Angel believed it would be more humane to revive the Bird-People, but Red Raven disagreed. He again sank the island, continuing the suspended animation process, and set Angel adrift on a raft.

Sometime later, following an undersea [[earthquake]], the Red Raven's suspended-animation capsule broke loose. It floated to the surface, where Red Raven was found by his old wartime ally the [[Sub-Mariner]]. The imperfect suspended-animation technology that he had used, however, had begun to drive Red Raven insane, a condition that worsened when he discovered that the Bird-People all were dead. In a mad rage, he accidentally caused an explosion that engulfed him and the entire island.<ref>Sub-Mariner #26</ref>

Sometime throughout all this, Red Raven had a daughter who, under the same name, became a superhero.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes'' vol. 3, #8 (Jan. 1992).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Red Raven flew with benefit of artificial wings. He was armed with the birdmen's advanced weaponry, including a [[raygun]] and an [[anti-gravity]] gun.
