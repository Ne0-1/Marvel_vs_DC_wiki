'''Red Raven''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Louis Cazeneuve]] in ''Red Raven Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1940), published by Marvel's predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

He is the first Timely/Marvel character to star in his own self-titled series, predating by several months ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #1 (March 1941).

==Publication history==
''Red Raven Comics'' was canceled after its premiere issue. Following his [[first appearance]], the character remained unused for more than two decades before being revived in the modern day as an [[antagonist]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #44 (May 1968). The Red Raven then battled [[Namor, the Sub-Mariner]] in ''Sub-Mariner'' #26 (June 1970). Although presumed dead for years, he eventually returned in ''[[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'' vol. 3, #4-5 (Aug.-Sept. 1999), and guest-starred in ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #6-7 (Aug. - Sept. 2001) and ''The Order'' #2 (May 2002).

In ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #29 (April 1976), Red Raven was [[retconned]] to have been a member of the stateside [[World War II]]-era superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]]. In that capacity he and his teammates guest-starred in ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]] Annual'' #1 (1976) and ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #6 (May 1976). He appeared in flashback [[cameo appearance|cameos]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Annual'' #12 (1984) and  ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #405 (Oct. 1995).

==Fictional character biography==
The boy who would become Red Raven was a child from [[Europe]], and the only survivor of a [[Atlantic Ocean|trans-Atlantic]] [[airplane]] crash. As an infant, he was adopted by a civilization of winged people who lived on a floating island in the sky, the Aerie, one kept aloft by [[antigravity]] drives and hidden from human civilization by artificial clouds. As he grew, he learned they were an [[avian]] offshoot of a human-alien hybrid race known as the [[Inhumans]], who had long ago left the hidden Inhuman city [[Attilan]], built their own abode, and learned to stabilize their genetics to reproduce only in this winged form.<ref>''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Annual'' #12 (1984)</ref> Calling themselves both The [[Bird people|Bird-People]] and The Winged Ones, they made their adopted son a uniform outfitted with anti-[[gravitons]] for flight and metal wings for navigation. During [[World War II]], fearing an escalation of [[Nazi Germany]]'s efforts that would encompasses his adopted people, the now-grown human wore a costume with large metal wings that enabled him to fly, and called himself Red Raven and joined the [[United States]] superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]], battling foes such as the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #29-30 (April-June 1976)</ref>

The Bird-People, however, planned to invade human civilization after the war. Red Raven foiled their plot by using gas to place the tribe, including himself, in [[suspended animation]], and sank their domed island to the bottom of the ocean, setting a timer to return them to the surface and reawaken them after several years. When the island eventually resurfaced near the end of the suspended-animation cycle, the superhero [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] of the [[X-Men]] stumbled upon the island. Angel and Red Raven clashed when the latter was startled by the former. Angel believed it would be more humane to revive the Bird-People, but Red Raven disagreed. He again sank the island to protect the secret of the Bird-People, continuing the suspended animation process, and set Angel adrift on a raft.<ref>''X-Men'' #44 (May 1968)</ref>

Sometime later, following an undersea [[earthquake]], the Red Raven's suspended-animation capsule broke loose. It floated to the surface, where Red Raven was found by his old wartime ally the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]. The imperfect suspended-animation technology that he had used, however, had begun to drive Red Raven insane. He tried to awaken the Bird-People to join their crusade against humanity, but was thwarted by Namor. His condition worsened when he discovered that the Bird-People had all died. In a mad rage, he accidentally caused an explosion that engulfed him and the entire island.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #26 (June 1970)</ref>

Sometime throughout all this, Red Raven had a daughter who, under the same name, became a superhero.<ref>''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 3, #8 (Jan. 1992), in the Sub-Mariner story "Leftovers" by writer Scott Lobdell and pencilers Ken Lopez and Chris Wozniak.</ref>

Red Raven eventually reappeared alive, and revealed that he'd faked his own death, that of the Bird People, and the sinking of the island.<ref>''Nova'' #4-5 (Aug.-Sept. 1999)</ref> The [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] are later brought to the Red Raven's sky-island and clash with the Raven.<ref>''Defenders'' #6-7 (Aug. - Sept. 2001)</ref> The Red Raven also encounters [[The Order (comics)#Defenders offshoot|The Order]] on his island.<ref>''The Order'' #2 (May 2002)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Red Raven costume was reinforced synthetic stretch fabric containing miniature anti-gravity mechanisms, as well as large artificial wings which allowed the Red Raven to fly. He was armed with the birdmen's advanced weaponry, including a [[raygun]] and an [[anti-gravity]] gun. He was proficient in basic hand-to-hand combat techniques uniquely styled to make use of his advantage of flight.
