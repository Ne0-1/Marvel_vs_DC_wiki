'''Red Raven''' is an obscure [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[comic book]] character who was briefly revived during the 1960s in the pages of ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]''.

==Character biography==
Red Raven was a normal human child from Europe and the only survivor of a trans-Atlantic plane crash. He was raised by a civilization of birdmen (reminiscent of the Hawk Men from [[Flash Gordon]] stories) who lived on island in the sky that was hidden from human civilization by artificial clouds. When the birdmen concocted a plan to invade human civilization, Red Raven foiled their plot by using gas to place the birdmen under [[suspended animation]] and sinking their island to the bottom of the ocean. Red Raven remained to guard their bodies.

After twenty years, the island rose to the surface and the suspended animation cycle neared its end. [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] stumbled upon the island when he was crossing the Atlantic to seek the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in rescuing the [[X-Men]] from [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Angel and Red Raven clashed when the latter was startled by the former's arrival. Angel believed it would be more humane to revive the birdmen, but Red Raven disagreed. He sank the island, continued the suspended animation process, and set Angel adrift on a raft.

==Powers and abilities==
Red Raven flew with benefit of artificial wings. He was armed with the birdmen's advanced weaponry, including a [[raygun]] and an [[anti-gravity]] gun.
