'''Harry Leland''', also known as the '''Black Bishop''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], and an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #132 ([[1980#April|April 1980]]).

A [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], Leland possesses the ability to increase the mass of an object or person, making it extremely heavy. Thanks to his allegiance to [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], he attained the rank of "'''Black Bishop,'''" of the Lords Cardinal of the New York branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|The Hellfire Club]], an exclusive [[secret society]] bent on world domination. In civilian life, he was a corporate lawyer.

==Biography==
Leland first encountered the X-Men when the X-Men invaded the New York headquarters of the Hellfire Club. Leland caused [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] to become super-heavy and fall through the floor into a sub-basement. After Wolverine returned and attacked Leland, he implied that he had slain Leland. But Leland was later revealed to have survived.

Alongside the Hellfire Club, Leland later battled the X-Men in New York's [[Central Park]]. Leland used his power to sink [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] hundreds of feet underground. When [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] attacked the assembled mutants, the X-Men and the Club joined forces to battle Nimrod. Against considerable resistance by the robot, Leland increased Nimrod's mass to move it towards the ground and thus vulnerable to attack. Overweight and in poor health, the effort caused Leland to have a heart attack. Then, at [[Storm (comics)|Storm]]'s urging, Leland increased the mass of Sebastian Shaw (who had been sent hurtling towards outer space by Nimrod), causing Shaw to crash into Nimrod's body on the ground. Leland succumbed to his heart condition and died.

But this was not the last to be seen of the Black Bishop. The supervillain [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] revived Leland's body, as well as the bodies of three other deceased mutants, as a zombie; his motives for doing such were unspecified. After [[She-Hulk]]'s defeat of the Talon, Leland was reburied. Precautions were taken to ensure that he never come back, among them filling his mouth with salt and sewing his lips together.

==Powers and abilities==
Leland possessed the ability to increase the mass of an object or person, making it extremely heavy. Leland's power could affect both people and inanimate objects, but resistance by the object made it more difficult to assert Leland's power. Leland was overweight and in poor health, and thus he was a poor hand-to-hand combatant.

==Trivia==
Artist John Byrne based Leland's appearance on actor-director [[Orson Welles]], and the name refers to two characters in Welles' films: Harry Lime from ''[[The Third Man]]'', and Jed Leland from ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.

[[Shinobi Shaw]] has speculated that Leland is Shinobi's biological father, but this has not been confirmed in canon.
