'''Wild Dog''' is a [[fictional]] [[vigilante]] based in the [[Quad Cities]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Wild Dog'' #1 (September 1987), and was created by [[Max Allan Collins]] and [[Terry Beatty]].

==Publication history==
Wild Dog first appeared in a four issue mini-series (issue #1, cover date September 1987). The series is credited to [[Max Allan Collins]], [[Terry Beatty]] and [[Dick Giordano]]. Shortly thereafter, the character appeared in ''[[Action Comics#Action Comics Weekly|Action Comics Weekly]]''. Normally a Superman title, at the time ''Action Comics'' was going through an incarnation as a high page count weekly anthology title with serialized episodes of various characters' ongoing stories appearing in each issue. There were three major Wild Dog story arcs in ''Action Comics Weekly''; after the third, the character appeared in his own one-shot ''Wild Dog Special''. Wild Dog's final appearance in ''Action Comics Weekly'' was issue #641 (cover date March 7, 1989). The last issue of ''Action Comics Weekly'' was #642, after which the book went back to its standard format of monthly Superman stories.

==Fictional character biography==
Jack Wheeler went to college on a football scholarship. He dropped out due to an injury and spent some time in the Marines. He quit that after most of his squad was killed by a terrorist bomb. He returned to the Quad Cities and began taking night classes. His new girlfriend was targeted and slain by hitmen as she was secretly the daughter of a Chicago crime boss.

Armed with a [[Jatimatic|Jatimatic GG-95 PDW]] and a pair of electrified "shock gloves", his costume consists of camouflage pants, combat boots, a local college football jersey emblazoned with a snarling red dog (hiding his protective body armor), and a hockey mask to conceal his identity. 

In the first issue of his limited series, he barges in on a hostage situation and kills all the criminals. He successfully rescues the endangered reporter.<ref>"Wild Dog" #1 (1987)</ref> His actions in the beginning are mainly directed against domestic American terrorists led by the "Committee for Social Change". He faces other threats, like a social group, the National Legion for Morality, willing to use arson to destroy pornographic material.<ref>"Action Comics Weekly" #603 (1988)</ref> 

Wild Dog changes opponents when he becomes a small part of the effort to resist an earth-wide alien invasion.<ref>"Invasion!" #2 (1988)</ref> Later, the alien [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] is sent to New York to kill the comic book editor [[Mike Carlin]]. Wild Dog is one of many recruited to stop Lobo. This group includes Black Condor, El Diablo, [[Garryn Bek]], Human Flea, Strata, Velvet Tiger and Wotan.<ref>"Lobo" Vol 2 #62 (May, 1999)</ref>

===Infinite Crisis===

Wild Dog was recently seen, alongside the current [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and the current [[Crimson Avenger]] on a Metropolis rooftop. This group, joining in on a hundreds-strong effort to protect the city from the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]], is seen raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and other villains in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7.

In an alternate timeline accidentally created by [[Booster Gold]] in ''Booster Gold'' #6 Wild Dog is part of a resistance cell against [[Maxwell Lord]], being one of the only heroes still alive or uncaptured. Lord forces Wild Dog to shoot himself.
