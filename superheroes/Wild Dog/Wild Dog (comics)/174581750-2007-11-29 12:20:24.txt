'''Wild Dog''' is a [[fictional]] [[vigilante]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Wild Dog'' #1 (September 1987), and was created by [[Max Allan Collins]] and [[Terry Beatty]]. 
 
==Publication History==
Wild Dog first appeared in a four issue mini-series (issue #1, cover date September 1987). The series is credited to [[Max Allan Collins]], [[Terry Beatty]] and [[Dick Giordano]]. Shortly thereafter, the character appeared in ''[[Action Comics#Action Comics Weekly|Action Comics Weekly]]''. There were three major Wild Dog story arcs in ''Action Comics Weekly''; in-between the second and third, the character appeared in his own one-shot ''Wild Dog Special''. Wild Dog's final appearance in ''Action Comics Weekly'' was issue #641 (cover date March 7 1989). The last issue of ''Action Comics Weekly'' was #642, after which the book went back to Superman stories, a normal page count, and normal monthly schedule.

==Fictional Character Biography==
Wild Dog was an auto mechanic named Jack Wheeler from the [[Quad Cities]] dedicated to fighting terrorism and urban crime. His actions in the beginning were mainly directed against domestic American terrorists led by the "Committee for Social Change". Wild Dog was quite willing to use deadly force.

Armed with a [[Jatimatic GG-95 SMG PDW]] and a pair of electrified "shock gloves", his costume consisted of camouflage pants, combat boots, college football jersey emblazoned with a snarling dog (hiding protective body armor) and a hockey mask to conceal his identity. 

The series was an attempt to bring a very down-to-earth vigilante into DC's stable of characters, one who didn't wear superhero-style spandex or battle high-tech international mercenaries - a street-level adventurer in a small town. The character was not a success and soon faded into obscurity. 

===Infinite Crisis===

Wild Dog was recently seen, alongside the current [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and the current [[Crimson Avenger]], on a rooftop in the great [[Battle of Metropolis]], raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]] and other villains in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7.
