'''Jonathan Powers''' was the first of several costumed criminals to use the identity of the Jester. He was primarily an enemy of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].

===Fictional character biography===
Jonathan Powers was born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He was a struggling actor of huge ego who finally got his lead break as the leading character in an off-Broadway revival of ''Cyrano de Bergerac''. Panned by critics, jeered by the audience, and disdained by his fellow performers, Powers was fired after one performance. Obsessively, he continued to study the various arts and crafts that he thought would make him a great actor, things like gymnastics and body building. He took everythingâ€”except acting classes. Still, Powers was able to find employment as a stooge in a children's television show taped in New York.

Finally getting fed up with having pies thrown in his face, Powers decided that if the audience wanted laughter, he would give it to them. Contracting the criminal weapons-maker known as the [[Tinkerer]] to make him a number of gimmicks, Powers fashioned himself a goofy harlequin-like disguise and called himself the Jester. Becoming a professional criminal, the Jester was hired by Richard Raleigh to kill [[Foggy Nelson]]. The Jester was opposed by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #42</ref> The Jester then framed Daredevil for the "murder" of Jonathan Powers, and battled Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #46</ref> Alongside the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]] and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], he battled Daredevil once more.<ref>''Daredevil'' #61</ref>

The Jester later broadcast false news reports smearing Foggy Nelson's political campaign and undermining public trust in the government and the media. He battled Daredevil once more.<ref>''Daredevil'' #124, 129, 131, 133-137</ref> The Jester was later employed by the [[Purple Man]]; alongside Cobra, Mister Hyde, and [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], he battled Daredevil and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #154</ref> He later battled [[Moon Knight]] and Daredevil as well.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #13</ref> 

For a time, the Jester tried to improve his life and restart his career as an actor.  As Jonathan Powers, he portrayed Cyrano de Bergerac on television, presumably abandoning the Jester identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #218</ref> However, his attempt to reform failed miserably. Late in [[Brian Michael Bendis|Brian Bendis]]' run on Daredevil (''Decalogue'' story-arc), it is revealed that Powers allowed himself to be host to a demon (one conjured up by a would-be Ninja), gaining great strength in the process. When the demon leaves him, Powers is apparently left comatose.<ref>''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) #71-75</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Jonathan Powers is an athletic man with no superhuman abilities. His main weapons are a set of various joke gimmicks converted into deadly weapons, designed by the [[Tinkerer]]. He used a variety of modified toys and gimmicks, including a yo-yo with a weighted knob and steel cable which emits earsplitting sounds when whirled at high speed; ball bearing marbles; exploding gas-filled "popcorn"; plastic flying discs which squirt an anesthetic drug; rubber balls containing plastic explosives; an extendible artificial hand equipped with an electrical charge; an artificial hand that can be fired from a small air-cannon; and other devices.

Powers also employed {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} miniature robots, equipped with items such as laser weaponry and diamond drill-bits, which were remotely controlled by a radio-linked microprocessor. He also employed a specially designed one-man submarine.

Powers is a well-trained hand-to-hand combatant, acrobat and fencer. He is trained in gymnastics, swordsmanship and unarmed combat. He is also a minimally talented actor.

===Fictional character biography===
This Jester was given his weaponry by [[Doctor Doom]]. Among the arsenal granted to him by Doom, the "long-lived" [[Hulk Robot]] created years prior by a pair of college students and the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] [[Uni-Mind]]. Jester recruited a team of villains made up of himself, the Hulk Robot, The [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] twins, [[Hydro-Man]], and [[Rock (Marvel comics)|Rock]] of The [[Hulkbusters]] to form the [[Assembly of Evil]]. The team was defeated by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] and several intervening [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Cloak & Dagger'' (vol. 3) #9</ref>

This '''Jester''' appeared during the super-hero [[Civil War (comic book)|''Civil War'']] as a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts Army]]. As part of the Thunderbolts Army, Jester was among the supervillains who helped capture unregistered heroes. Jester did this due to nanobots in his system which would electrocute him if he didn't do as he was told.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>

The Jester and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] are sent to bring in [[Spider-Man]]. They pursue the hero through the sewers. Spider-Man ends up badly injured and subdued as the two move in for the kill. Both Jack and Jester are then shot dead by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> This fight and these deaths are also detailed in the ''Punisher: War Journal'' title. <ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal#Volume Two|Punisher War Journal]]'' #2-3 (Feb.-March 2007)</ref> 

[[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mr Hyde]] later exhumed the body to find a way around the nanotechnlogy.<ref>Thunderbolts - Reason in Madness one-shot</ref>
