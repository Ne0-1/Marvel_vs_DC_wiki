'''Jester''' is the name of three [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillains]].

==Jonathan Powers==
===Fictional character biography===
Jonathan Powers was born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He was a struggling actor of huge ego who finally got his lead break as the leading character in an off-Broadway revival of Cyrano de Bergerac. Panned by critics, jeered by the audience, and disdained by his fellow performers, Powers was fired after one performance. Obsessively, he continued to study the various arts and crafts that he thought would make him a great actor, things like gymnastics and body building. He took everythingâ€”except acting classes. Still, Powers was able to find employment as a stooge in a children's television show taped in New York.

Finally getting fed up with having pies thrown in his face, Powers decided that if the audience wanted laughter, he would give it to them. Contracting the criminal weapons-maker known as the Tinkerer to make him a number of gimmicks, Powers fashioned himself a goofy harlequin-like disguise and called himself the Jester. Committing several crimes, the Jester was eventually opposed by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] who put the Jester behind bars. 

Since then, the Jester escaped jail various times and continued to fight Daredevil, only to lose at every turn. For a time, the Jester tried to improve his life and restart his life as an actor, but this once again failed miserably.  Late in Brian Bendis' run on Daredevil (Decalogue story-arc), Powers is revealed to have allowed himself to act as host to a demon (one conjured up by a would-be Ninja), gaining great strength in the process. When the demon leaves him, Powers is apparently left comatose. 

Recently, during the super-hero [[Civil War (comic book)|''Civil War'']], the Jester appeared, although it isn't stated if it's Powers or someone else.  

The Jester and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] are sent to bring in [[Spider-Man]]. They pursue the hero through the sewers. Spider-Man ends up badly injured and subdued as the two move in for the kill. Both Jack and Jester are then shot dead by the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]]

===Powers and abilities===
Jonathan Powers has no super-human abilities. He is a well-trained hand-to-hand combatant, acrobat and fencer. His main weapons are a set of various joke gimmicks converted into deadly weapons: explosive balls, extendable scissor-hands capable of delivering electric shocks or bombs, weighted [[yo-yo]]s which can be used as clubbing weapons, etc.

==Acts of Vengeance==
===Fictional character biography===
A successor of Powers appeared during the [[Acts of Vengeance]] which took place during the original's failed retirement from super-villainy. This Jester was given his weaponry by [[Doctor Doom]]. Among the arsenal granted to him by Doom, the "long-lived" [[Hulk Robot]] created years prior by a pair of college students and the [[Eternal]] [[Uni-Mind]]. Jester recruited a team of villains made up of himself, the Hulk robot, The [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] twins, [[Hydro-Man]], and ''[[Rock (Marvel Comics)|Rock]]'' of ''The [[Hulkbusters]]'' to form the [[Assembly of Evil]]. The team was defeated by [[Cloak and Dagger]] and several intervening [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

===Personality and traits===
This Jester's personality and appearance bore similarities to those of [[Paul Reubens|Pee-Wee Herman]] and [[Ed Grimley]] (both popular media figures at the time of the character's introduction).
