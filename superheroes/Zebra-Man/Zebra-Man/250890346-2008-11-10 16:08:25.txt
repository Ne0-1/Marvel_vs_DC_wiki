The first Zebra-Man was a high-tech scientist whose machinery has irradiated his entire body. It also gave him superpowers that enabled him to attract and repel anything besides metal (referred to in "the real world" as Diamagnetism). With his body covered by black and white stripes and highlighted by a glowing aura, he became Zebra-Man. He went on a crime spree before he was defeated by [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

===Zebra-Man II===

When [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] was creating a strike-force called [[Strikeforce Kobra]] to ursurp Stagg Enterprises in his goal of World Domination, one of the villains he created was patterned after the original Zebra-Man. This new Zebra-Man alongside the other Strikeforce Kobra members fought the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] to a draw, but Zebra-Man escaped. When Strikeforce Kobra was reassembled, Zebra-Man was not seen. He has been sighted in [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].
