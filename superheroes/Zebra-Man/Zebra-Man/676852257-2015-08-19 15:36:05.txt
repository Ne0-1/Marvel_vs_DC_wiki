The first Zebra-Man was a high-tech scientist whose machinery irradiated his entire body. It also gave him superpowers that enabled him to attract and repel anything besides metal (referred to within the story as "Diamagnetism"). With his body covered by black and white stripes and highlighted by a glowing aura, he became Zebra-Man. He went on a crime spree before where he encountered [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

During the first fight, Batman was accidentally irradiated by the same energy. Without an inhibitor belt, Batman was out of control with his diamagnetism causing Robin to go on without him. Batman soon took advantage of the diamagnetism and used it to attract Zebra-Man to himself and then attract both of them to Gotham City Police Department.

===Kobra's Zebra-Man===

When [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]] creates a strike-force called [[Strikeforce Kobra]] to usurp [[Simon Stagg|Stagg Enterprises]] in his goal of world domination, one of the villains he creates is patterned after the original Zebra-Man. Unlike the previous Zebra-Man, this version lacks the aura of the first Zebra-Man and has a mohawk that evoked the image of his equine namesake.

Kobra's Zebra-Man, alongside the other Strikeforce Kobra members, fights the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] to a draw, but Zebra-Man escapes with [[Elemental Woman]], [[Planet Master]], Eve, and Kobra. His colleague, Spectrumonster, does not survive the battle. When Strikeforce Kobra is reassembled, Zebra-Man is not seen.

He has been sighted in [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>Infinite Crisis #7</ref>

A version of Zebra-Man appears in [[the New 52]] (a reboot of the [[DC Universe|DC Comics universe]]) as an inmate of [[Arkham Asylum]], currently going by the moniker "Vortex." He first appears as one of the many prisoners attempting to escape in a massive breakout attempt, which is stopped by [[Batman]].<ref>''Batman: The Dark Knight'' #1 (2011)</ref> He later appears attempting to help [[Catwoman]] escape her incarceration in the asylum, but is physically beaten by her.<ref>''Catwoman'' #19 (2011)</ref>

During the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, Vortex appears as a member of Cheetah's Menagerie. He was among those frozen by [[Killer Frost]].<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Zebra-Man I and II have the ability of diamagnetism which enables them to attract and/or repel stuff besides metal. Both used an inhibitor belt to control their diamagnetism.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The original Zebra-Man appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Mite." He is an illusion created by [[Bat-Mite]] when he "becomes" Batman. Zebra-Man is defeated when the real Batman steals his stripes causing him to become embarrassed and leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0807/25/batmanbrave.htm |title=Comic-Con International - Batman: The Brave and the Bold |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> Zebra-Man later appears in "Duel of the Double Crossers" violating his parole by using his magnetic powers to rob an armored truck. He is easily defeated by Batman. The "Zebra Batman" appearance which Batman had during his first battle with Zebra-Man, in the comics, is also shown in the previous episode. In "A Bat Divided", Zebra-Man was also seen in a bar where the bad guys hang out when [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up. In this show, his powers actually work on metal.
