The first Zebra-Man was a high-tech scientist whose machinery has irradiated his entire body. It also gave him superpowers that enabled him to attract and repel anything besides metal (referred to in "the real world" as Diamagnetism). With his body covered by black and white stripes and highlighted by a glowing aura, he became Zebra-Man. He went on a crime spree before where he encountered [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

During the first fight, Batman was accidentally irradiated by the same energy. Without an inhibitor belt, Batman was out of control with his diamagnetism causing Robin to go on without him. Batman soon took advantage of the diamagnetism and used it to attacked Zebra-Man to him and attract both of them to Gotham City Police Department.

When [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] was creating a strike-force called [[Strikeforce Kobra]] to ursurp [[Simon Stagg|Stagg Enterprises]] in his goal of world domination, one of the villains he created was patterned after the original Zebra-Man. Unlike the previous Zebra-Man, this version lacked the aura of the first Zebra-Man and has a mohawk that evoked the image of his equine namesake.

Kobra's Zebra-Man alongside the other Strikeforce Kobra members fought the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] to a draw, but Zebra-Man escaped with [[Elemental Woman]], [[Planet Master]], Eve, and Kobra. When Strikeforce Kobra was reassembled, Zebra-Man was not seen.

He has been sighted in [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>Infinite Crisis #7</ref>

==Powers and Abilities==
Zebra-Man I and II have the ability of diamagnetism which enables them to attract and/or repel stuff besides metal. Both used an inhibitor belt to control their diamagnetism.

* The original Zebra-Man  appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Mite." He is an illusion created by [[Bat-Mite]] when he "becomes" Batman. Zebra-Man is defeated when the real Batman steals his stripes, causing him to become embarrassed, and leave.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0807/25/batmanbrave.htm Comics Continuum: Comic-Con International - Batman: The Brave and the Bold<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Zebra-Man later appears in "Duel of the Double Crossers", violating his parole and using his magnetic powers to rob an armored truck. He is easily defeated by Batman. The "Zebra Batman" appearance Batman had during his first battle with Zebra-Man in the comics is also shown in the previous episode.
