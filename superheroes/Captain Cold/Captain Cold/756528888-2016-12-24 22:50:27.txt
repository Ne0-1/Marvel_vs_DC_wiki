==Publication history==
Captain Cold first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #8 (June 1957) and was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]].

==Fictional character biography==
Leonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather, who worked in an ice truck. When his grandfather died, Snart grew tired of his father's abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire. This visor design would later be adapted by Snart into his trademark costume. In recent years he has added a radio receiver to them which picks up the police band to monitor local law enforcement. Snart and the other thugs were captured by the Flash and imprisoned. Snart decided to go solo, but knew he had to do something about the local hero, the Flash.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Snart read an article that theorized that the energy emissions of a [[cyclotron]] could interfere with the Flash's speed. He designed a weapon to harness that power and broke into a cyclotron lab, intending to use the device to charge up his experimental gun. As he was finishing his experiment, a security guard surprised Snart. Intending to use his gun only to scare the guard, he inadvertently pulled the trigger and discovered that his weapon had been altered in a way he had never imagined. The moisture in the air around the guard froze. Intrigued by this twist of fate, Snart donned a [[Anorak|parka]] and the aforementioned visor and declared himself to be Captain Cold - the man who mastered absolute zero. Snart then committed a series of non-lethal crimes, on one occasion placing the city in suspended animation in an attempt to force Iris West to marry him as he had fallen in love with her when he saw her in the prison, but the Flash got through a wall of ice and was able to reverse the process. He later fell in love with a newscaster, and competed with [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] (in his first appearance) over her in a crime spree, but they were both beaten by the Flash. But after Barry Allen's death, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Captain Cold became a [[bounty hunter]] with his sister Lisa, the [[Golden Glider]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

During the events of ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Captain Cold lost his soul to [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]] but Wally West brought it back to the land of the living. He soon returned to crime, this time a member of Wally's Rogues Gallery. The Rogues had first been assembled when another Flash foe, the super-intelligent [[Gorilla Grodd]] had broken them out of jail to distract the Flash. The Golden Glider had abandoned her bounty hunter career and had started partnering with a series of thugs who she dressed in a costume, armed with a copy of Captain Cold's signature Cold Gun, and called [[Chillblaine]]. Already distraught over the death of her lover, the [[Top (comics)|Top]], it seemed that the supposed death of her brother pushed her over the edge. But the last Chillblaine was a little smarter and more vicious. He murdered the Golden Glider, prompting Captain Cold to hunt him down, torture him and kill him by freezing his outer layer of skin and then pushing him off a high rise building. Not long after that, Snart was framed by a new incarnation of [[Mister Element]]. He used his Element Gun to simulate Cold's gun, using ice and cold to murder several police officers before Captain Cold and the Flash discovered who was actually responsible. With the death of his sister, and having killed Chillblaine and Mr. Element in vengeance, Cold has again become an unrepentant criminal. However, during a confrontation with [[Brother Grimm]], Cold actually worked with Wally West to defeat the powerful magic user, although this was mainly because he and [[Mirror Master]] had been betrayed by Grimm and wanted revenge.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Captain Cold was declared the leader of the Flash's Rogue's Gallery. His skill and experience have made him a strong leader to the likes of the [[Weather Wizard]], the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], the new [[Mirror Master]], and the [[Owen Mercer|new Captain Boomerang]]. Len seems to have taken the young Captain Boomerang under his wing, after the elder Boomerang was recently killed. Tabloids rumoured that Captain Cold's sister, the Golden Glider, was Boomerang's mother, making him Captain Cold's nephew. This turned out to be false, however, as the new Boomerang's mother has been revealed to be [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Bart Allen]]. Despite his more ruthless nature as of late, Captain Cold's heart is not completely frozen, evidenced by having sent flowers to honor [[Sue Dibny]], murdered wife of the [[Elongated Man]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}

Traditionally, Captain Cold is driven by three things: money, women, and the desire to beat Barry Allen. Although not the lech that Captain Boomerang was, Len Snart has an eye for the ladies, particularly models. When Barry Allen died, Captain Cold drifted for a while, jumping back and forth over the lines of crime and justice. He was captured by the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and served time in the [[Suicide Squad]], worked with his sister as a bounty hunter (Golden Snowball Recoveries), and, with his longtime friend and sometimes nemesis [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], encountered [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] of the [[Justice League]]. He has teamed up with various villains over the years other than the many Rogues. These include [[Catwoman]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His favorite baseball team is the [[Houston Astros]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}

==="One Year Later"===
In the 2006 "[[One Year Later]]" storyline, he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]). Though Inertia was defeated, Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Heat Wave, Mirror Master and Abra Kadabra killed Bart with a combined barrage of their elemental weapons. He, Heat Wave, and Weather Wizard seemed to express guilt, however, after learning the identity of the Flash and how young he was.

===''Salvation Run''===
Captain Cold is one of the exiled villains featured in the 2007-08 miniseries ''[[Salvation Run]]'' along with his fellow Rogues: [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].

===''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge''===
In the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'', Captain Cold and the Rogues briefly joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' story, however, Cold and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #1</ref> Cold and his group is challenged by a new set of Rogues, formed by Libra to be their replacements. The new group, having kidnapped Cold's father, challenge the Rogues, and are defeated and killed. Cold goes to his father, talking to him about the abuse he suffered, and the fate of his sister. After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #2</ref> The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #3</ref> In "Final Crisis" #7, someone that looks like Captain Cold appears as a [[Justifiers|Justifier]] and is seen fighting the Female Furies alongside the other Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control.

===''The Flash: Rebirth''===
In the 2009 ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' miniseries, Captain Cold is seen with the other Rogues, reading about Barry Allen's return and claiming that they would need more of the Rogues.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> The Rogues are still debating Allen's return, with Cold saying it's time to pull out their contingency plan that [[Mirror Master|Scudder]] came up with, stating ''"In case The Flash returns, break glass."''<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (February 2010)</ref>

==="Blackest Night"===
In the 2009–2010 "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline, the Rogues realize that the bodies of various dead Rogues are missing and prepare to fight them. Captain Cold knows that his sister, the Golden Glider, is among the reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] but is still ready to lead the Rogues against the zombies.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)</ref> He is confronted by the Black Lantern Glider, who attempts to use his feelings of love for her against him. However, Captain Cold manages to suppress these feelings long enough for him to fight back, freezing her within a block of ice.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> He subsequently kills Owen Mercer by throwing him into a pit with his Black Lantern father when he learns that Owen has been feeding people to his father in the belief that consuming flesh will restore him to life, informing Owen that Rogues do not kill women and children.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)</ref>

===The New 52===
In the timeline of the 2011 company-wide reboot of all its superhero titles, [[The New 52]], Captain Cold is reintroduced as a younger man than in the previous timeline. His origin remains the same, however, his sister Lisa has not been the Golden Glider, and is instead dying of [[cancer]]. Upon learning that the hospital does not have enough energy to power a laser that could save her life, because of an EMP seemingly caused by the Flash, Cold blames him for everything that has happened to him, including a falling out with the Rogues, and decides to break the rules of their "game" and kill the Flash. Captain Cold has undergone experiments that have given him ice-based metahuman powers, including the ability to slow down the molecules around him, creating a field of inertia that reduces the Flash's speed to human level, allowing Captain Cold to touch him and effortlessly beat him.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #6 (February 2012)</ref> He and the Rogues are set to return,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #7 (March 2012)</ref> but later defeated them with help from Flash, and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].<ref>''The Flash annual'' #1</ref>

After freeing the Trickster and attending the meeting at the Justice League Watchtower, the Rogues return to Central and Keystone City, only to see that both have been destroyed by Gorilla Grodd. Grodd returns to Central City during the eclipse, while a ceremony commemorating Flash between the humans and gorillas is occurring. Grodd proceeds to take control of Central City as its king and renames it Gorilla City. Captain Cold sees the city's cops tied up from Grodd, and proceeds to free them. He then asks Mirror Master to help him get to the hospital where his sister is being held in order to check on her. While there, the Crime Syndicate send Black Bison, Hyena, Multiplex, Plastique and Typhoon to finish Grodd's work and destroy the hospital. The Rogues are able to hold them off, only to be interrupted by Deathstorm and Power Ring, who were sent by Ultraman to deal with the Rogues for resisting the Crime Syndicate's offer to join them. After battling Deathstorm and Power Ring, Deathstorm attacks Captain Cold and is able to extract his freezing powers from his DNA. Mirror Master attempts to get the Rogues out through the Mirror World, but Power Ring destroys the mirror causing the Rogues to be separated. Captain Cold ends up at Luthor and his Kryptonian clone's location where they are also joined by Black Manta, who has retrieved Black Adam from the ocean.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #3</ref> Luthor realizes that, with the help of his clone, Black Adam, Black Manta, and Captain Cold, he may be able to stop the Crime Syndicate. Captain Cold and the rest of the squad, now joined by [[Batman]], [[Catwoman]], [[Sinestro]] and [[Deathstroke]], infiltrate the fallen Watchtower, where Black Manta kills the Outsider and Cold proceeds to shatter [[Johnny Quick]]'s right leg after having frozen the molecules in it with his cold gun. He then unmasks the hooded prisoner brought over from [[Earth-3]], revealing it to be Alexander Luthor, who is their version of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], Mazahs, who states he will kill them all.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> {{issue|date=June 2014}} After defeating the crime syndicate, Captain Cold is pardoned by the U.S government. Cold and Luthor become members of the Justice League.

==='Rebirth'===
Snart and the Rogues have yet to make a full appearance in the 2016 ongoing 'Rebirth' storylines, though they are seen fleetingly watching a news report about the many newly created speedsters appearing throughout the city. Snart quips that it's time for the Rogues to leave Central City for a while. Visually the Rogues still seem to be based upon their New 52 appearances in this cameo, though when Snart later appears in one of Flash's memory flashbacks he has resorted to an even older look.

==Powers and abilities==
Like the majority of the Flash's rogues, Snart had no innate superhuman powers. He instead relied on his cold guns and instincts. Over the years Snart had modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as:
* A cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly.
* Creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks. Cold uses this ability to slow down the Flash's movements.
* Bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain. Cold used this to kill Chill Blaine who murdered Cold's sister to make him suffer as much as possible.
* Creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the Flash.
* Forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies. Used to kill Chill Blaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible.
* An "ice grenade" which was stated to "turn this place into an iceberg". Used to freeze everything in a large radius, and  the whole of Iron Heights during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.
* Creating "mirages" out of extreme cold-like heat.

Fellow ice-based villain [[Mr. Freeze]] has noted that Cold is the only cold-themed villain in the DC Universe to have mastered "absolute zero" with his weapons.

In the New 52 universe Captain Cold initially had metahuman ice powers, including the power to slow down the Flash with an inertia field, but these powers are later lost in the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' series when he is attacked by Deathstorm- the Earth-3 counterpart of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]- with Cold reverting to using his classic ice gun. Despite his lack of professional expertise, Cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #4</ref>

==Other versions==
*Captain Cold appears in [[Darwyn Cooke]]'s series ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]''. Here he robs a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casino where some DC heroes and others are attending a boxing match between [[Cassius Clay]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted "Wildcat" Grant]].

*The 25th century Captain Cold is a heroic Captain Cold, named '''Commander Cold''' as part of the 25th Century cops known as [[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|The Renegades]] from [[Professor Zoom]]'s future, and the team's leader. Commander Cold's face, in the one shot of it without his shades, shows an uncanny resemblance to Barry Allen. He may be a descendant, or even a future version of Allen.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)</ref>
*Captain Cold had made two appearances in the animated-continuity comic ''[[DC Animated Universe Comics|Justice League Adventures]]''. In issue #12, he and other ice-related villains encased an African city in ice.<ref>''Justice League Adventures'' #12</ref>

** The character first appears as a recurring villain on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''. His stolen [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] 'cold gun' was created by [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] to subdue a speedster, due to its ability to freeze anything to absolute zero temperatures. In the first season, Snart attempts to eliminate the Flash multiple times, eventually recruiting his former colleague, [[Heat Wave (comics)|Mick Rory]], to join forces against the new hero, giving his pyromanic accomplice a handheld flamethrower to do so. Now known as the supervillains Captain Cold and Heat Wave, the two end up being defeated by the Flash, only to escape with the aid of Snart's sister, [[Golden Glider|Lisa]]. Snart then captures Cisco and learns the Flash's secret identity of [[Barry Allen (Flash)|Barry Allen]], with whom he makes a deal: Snart will keep Barry's identity a secret, and in exchange Barry will not interfere with his heists. Snart later betrays Barry during a [[metahuman]] prison transfer by freeing the inmates from captivity, stating that they would make a great addition his "Rogues" crew. In season two, Snart is blackmailed into working with his abusive father, Lewis, who plants a bomb in Lisa to ensure his son's cooperation. When the bomb is deactivated, Snart kills his father in retaliation. Despite being apprehended, Snart is later freed from prison by [[Weather Wizard|Mark Mardon]], but instead leaves Central City.
***On Earth-2, Snart is mentioned to be the mayor of Central City.
** Snart returns as a main character in the first season of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''. He and Mick are recruited into [[Rip Hunter]]'s team, which is formed to prevent the immortal [[Vandal Savage]] from conquering the world; the two join the time-travelling crew to steal valuables from the past before they are discovered. In the episode "Blood Ties", Snart attempts to alter his own past and prevent the cycle of abuse he and his sister suffered at the hands of their father. But unfortunately, Snart learns that the timeline always finds a way to restore itself. When Rory later betrays the team, Snart maroons his partner in an isolated area. A vengeful Rory then returns as the Time Masters' temporal bounty hunter [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]], and subsequently captures Snart for abandoning him. Snart later manages to escape, and convinces the team to try and reform Rory after they defeat him. They eventually succeed, and Rory rejoins the team. Near the end of the season, Snart is instrumental in defeating and capturing Savage by convincing his [[Scandal Savage|daughter]] to turn against him. In "Destiny", Snart sacrifices himself to save Rory and ensure the team's survival after they learn that the Time Masters have been working with Savage and manipulating the team for their own ends.
