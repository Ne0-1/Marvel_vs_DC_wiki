==Fictional character biography==
Leonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather, who worked in an ice truck. When his grandfather died, Len grew tired of his father's abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire. This visor design would later be adapted by Snart into his trademark costume. In recent years he has added a radio receiver to them which picks up the police band to monitor local law enforcement. Snart and the other thugs were captured by the Flash and imprisoned. Snart decided to go solo, but knew he had to do something about the local hero, the Flash.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Snart read an article that theorized that the energy emissions of a [[cyclotron]] could interfere with the Flash's speed. He designed a weapon to harness that power and broke into a cyclotron lab, intending to use the device to charge up his experimental gun. As he was finishing his experiment, a security guard surprised Snart. Intending to use his gun only to scare the guard, he inadvertently pulled the trigger and discovered that his weapon had been altered in a way he had never imagined. The moisture in the air around the guard froze. Intrigued by this twist of fate, Snart donned a [[Anorak|parka]] and the aforementioned visor and declared himself to be Captain Cold - the man who mastered absolute zero. Snart then committed a series of non-lethal crimes, on one occasion placing the city in suspended animation in an attempt to force Iris West to marry him as he had fallen in love with her when he saw her in the prison, but the Flash got through a wall of ice and was able to reverse the process. He later fell in love with a newscaster, and competed with [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] (in his first appearance) over her in a crime spree, but they were both beaten by the Flash. But after Barry Allen's death, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Captain Cold became a [[bounty hunter]] with his sister Lisa, the [[Golden Glider]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

During the events of ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Captain Cold lost his soul to [[Neron]] but Wally West brought it back to the land of the living. He soon returned to crime, this time a member of Wally's Rogues Gallery. The Rogues had first been assembled when another Flash foe, the super-intelligent [[Gorilla Grodd]] had broken them out of jail to distract the Flash. The Golden Glider had abandoned her bounty hunter career and had started partnering with a series of thugs who she dressed in a costume, armed with a copy of Captain Cold's signature Cold Gun, and called [[Chillblaine]]. Already distraught over the death of her lover, the [[Top (comics)|Top]], it seemed that the supposed death of her brother pushed her over the edge. But the last Chillblaine was a little smarter and more vicious. He murdered the Golden Glider, prompting Captain Cold to hunt him down, torture him and kill him by freezing his outer layer of skin and then pushing him off a high rise building. Not long after that, Snart was framed by a new incarnation of [[Mister Element]]. He used his Element Gun to simulate Cold's gun, using ice and cold to murder several police officers before Captain Cold and the Flash discovered who was actually responsible. With the death of his sister, and having killed Chillblaine and Mr. Element in vengeance, Cold has again become an unrepentant criminal. However, during a confrontation with [[Brother Grimm]], Cold actually worked with Wally West to defeat the powerful magic user, although this was mainly because he and [[Mirror Master]] had been betrayed by Grimm and wanted revenge.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Captain Cold was declared the leader of the Flash's Rogue's Gallery. His skill and experience have made him a strong leader to the likes of the [[Weather Wizard]], the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], the new [[Mirror Master]], and the [[Owen Mercer|new Captain Boomerang]]. Len seems to have taken the young Captain Boomerang under his wing, after the elder Boomerang was recently killed. Tabloids rumoured that Captain Cold's sister, the Golden Glider, was Boomerang's mother, making him Captain Cold's nephew. This turned out to be false, however, as the new Boomerang's mother has been revealed to be [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Bart Allen]]. Despite his more ruthless nature as of late, Captain Cold's heart is not completely frozen, evidenced by having sent flowers to honor [[Sue Dibny]], murdered wife of the [[Elongated Man]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}

Traditionally, Captain Cold is driven by three things: money, women, and the desire to beat Barry Allen. Although not the lech that Captain Boomerang was, Len Snart has an eye for the ladies, particularly models. When Barry Allen died, Captain Cold drifted for a while, jumping back and forth over the lines of crime and justice. He was captured by the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and served time in the [[Suicide Squad]], worked with his sister as a bounty hunter (Golden Snowball Recoveries), and, with his longtime friend and sometimes nemesis [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], encountered [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] of the [[Justice League]]. He has teamed up with various villains over the years other than the many Rogues. These include [[Catwoman]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His favorite baseball team is the [[Houston Astros]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}

==="One Year Later"===
In the 2006 "[[One Year Later]]" storyline, he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]). Though Inertia was defeated, Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Heat Wave, Mirror Master and Abra Kadabra killed Bart with a combined barrage of their elemental weapons. He, Heat Wave, and Weather Wizard seemed to express guilt, however, after learning the identity of the Flash and how young he was.

===''Salvation Run''===

The new group, having kidnapped Cold's father, challenge the Rogues, and are defeated and killed. Cold goes to his father, talking to him about the abuse he suffered, and the fate of his sister. After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #2</ref> The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #3</ref> In "Final Crisis" #7, someone that looks like Captain Cold appears as a [[Justifiers|Justifier]] and is seen fighting the Female Furies alongside the other Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control.

==="Blackest Night"===
In the 2009–2010 "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline, the Rogues realize that the bodies of various dead Rogues are missing and prepare to fight them. Captain Cold knows that his sister, the Golden Glider, is among the reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] but is still ready to lead the Rogues against the zombies.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)</ref> He is confronted by the Black Lantern Glider, who attempts to use his feelings of love for her against him. However, Captain Cold manages to suppress these feelings long enough for him to fight back, freezing her within a block of ice.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> He subsequently kills Owen Mercer by throwing him into a pit with his Black Lantern father when he learns that Owen has been feeding people to his father in the belief that consuming flesh will restore him to life, informing Owen that Rogues do not kill women and children.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)</ref>

===The New 52===
In the timeline of the 2011 company-wide reboot of all its superhero titles, [[The New 52]], Captain Cold is reintroduced as a younger man than in the previous timeline. His origin remains the same, however, his sister Lisa has not been the Golden Glider, and is instead dying of [[cancer]]. Upon learning that the hospital does not have enough energy to power a laser that could save her life, because of an EMP seemingly caused by the Flash, Cold blames him for everything that has happened to him, including a falling out with the Rogues, and decides to break the rules of their "game" and kill the Flash. Captain Cold has undergone experiments that have given him ice-based metahuman powers, including the ability to slow down the molecules around him, creating a field of inertia that reduces the Flash's speed to human level, allowing Captain Cold to touch him and effortlessly beat him.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #6 (February 2012)</ref> He and the Rogues are set to return,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #7 (March 2012)</ref> but later defeated them with help from Flash, and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].<ref>''The Flash annual'' #1</ref>

After freeing the Trickster and attending the meeting at the Justice League Watchtower, the Rogues return to Central and Keystone City, only to see that both have been destroyed by Gorilla Grodd. Grodd returns to Central City during the eclipse, while a ceremony commemorating Flash between the humans and gorillas is occurring. Grodd proceeds to take control of Central City as its king and renames it Gorilla City. Captain Cold sees the city's cops tied up from Grodd, and proceeds to free them. He then asks Mirror Master to help him get to the hospital where his sister is being held in order to check on her. While there, the Crime Syndicate send Black Bison, Hyena, Multiplex, Plastique and Typhoon to finish Grodd's work and destroy the hospital. The Rogues are able to hold them off, only to be interrupted by Deathstorm and Power Ring, who were sent by Ultraman to deal with the Rogues for resisting the Crime Syndicate's offer to join them. After battling Deathstorm and Power Ring, Deathstorm attacks Captain Cold and is able to extract his freezing powers from his DNA. Mirror Master attempts to get the Rogues out through the Mirror World, but Power Ring destroys the mirror causing the Rogues to be separated. Captain Cold ends up at Luthor and his Kryptonian clone's location where they are also joined by Black Manta, who has retrieved Black Adam from the ocean.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #3</ref> Luthor realizes that, with the help of his clone, Black Adam, Black Manta, and Captain Cold, he may be able to stop the Crime Syndicate. Captain Cold and the rest of the squad, now joined by [[Batman]], [[Catwoman]], [[Sinestro]] and [[Deathstroke]], infiltrate the fallen Watchtower, where Black Manta kills the Outsider and Cold proceeds to shatter [[Johnny Quick]]'s right leg after having frozen the molecules in it with his cold gun. He then unmasks the hooded prisoner brought over from [[Earth-3]], revealing it to be Alexander Luthor, who is their version of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], Mazahs, who states he will kill them all.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #6</ref> {{issue|date=June 2014}} After defeating the crime syndicate, Captain Cold is pardoned by the U.S government. Cold and Luthor become members of the Justice League.

==Powers and abilities==
Like the majority of the Flash's rogues, Snart had no innate superhuman powers. He instead relied on his cold guns and instincts. Over the years Snart had modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as:
* A cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly.
* Creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks. Cold uses this ability to slow down The Flash's movements.
* Bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain. Cold used this to kill Chill Blaine who murdered Cold's sister to make him suffer as much as possible.
* Creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the Flash.
* Forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies. Used to kill Chill Blaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible.
* An "ice grenade" which was stated to "turn this place into an iceberg". Used to freeze everything in a large radius, and  the whole of Iron Heights during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.
* Creating "mirages" out of extreme cold-like heat.

Fellow ice-based villain [[Mr. Freeze]] has noted that Cold is the only cold-themed villain in the DC Universe to have mastered "absolute zero" with his weapons.

In the New 52 universe Captain Cold initially had metahuman ice powers, including the power to slow down the Flash with an inertia field, but these powers are later lost in the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' series when he is attacked by Deathstorm- the Earth-3 counterpart of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]- with Cold reverting to using his classic ice gun. Despite his lack of professional expertise, Cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #4</ref>

==Costume==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Like his fellow Rogues, Captain Cold's costume was developed by [[Paul Gambi]], personal Tailor to the Rogues, allowing Cold to withstand the rigors of his Cold abilities. For 50 years his costume has stayed virtually the same. Slight variants include:
* A white [[holster]] instead of the traditional yellow.
* A [[visor]] with a single eye slit rather than the traditional individual eye slits, (during his work with the Suicide Squad).
* A [[parka]] instead of the traditional spandex material.
* The white "frost" on his parka painted or sewn onto it, but some variants have it as an additional piece of white cloth that loosely sits over the top of the parka.
* The Cold Gun is a [[magenta]] colored pistol with one main [[barrel]] and two to four tubes also emitting from it. Although it has been drawn in a multitude of ways by DC artists, this basic original design has always been kept.

==Other versions==
*Captain Cold appears in [[Darwyn Cooke]]'s series ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]''. Here he robs a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casino where some DC heroes and others are attending a boxing match between [[Cassius Clay]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted "Wildcat" Grant]]. Captain Cold bursts in and freezes [[Iris West Allen|Iris Allen]]'s hand attached to a phone, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] hears the call from his home in and turns into the Flash, and stops Captain Cold from freezing Vegas in cryogenic detonators. While trying to escape, Flash crashes the copter with the henchwoman in and takes him down, the Flash rewired his gun and it frozen him inside.<ref>''DC: The New Frontier'' #2 (April 2004)</ref>

*Based in the ''[[DC Super Friends]]'' universe, Captain Cold is part of a group of ice-themed villains called the "Ice Pack" that encased a city in ice and snow. The Ice Pack appear in ''DC Super Friends'' #16 (August 2009).

*A teen version of Captain Cold known as '''Kid Kold''' appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic as an enemy of [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]]. Like his adult counterpart, Kold had a sister who was also a supervillain, dubbed '''Ice Kate'''.<ref>''Teen Titans Go!'' #53</ref>

*The 25th century Captain Cold is a heroic Captain Cold, named '''Commander Cold''' as part of the 25th Century cops known as [[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|The Renegades]] from [[Professor Zoom]]'s future, and the team's leader. Commander Cold's face, in the one shot of it without his shades, shows an uncanny resemblance to Barry Allen. He may be a descendant, or even a future version of Allen.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)</ref>

*Captain Cold had made two appearances in the animated-continuity comic ''[[DC Animated Universe Comics|Justice League Adventures]]''. In issue #12, he and other ice-related villains encased an African city in ice.<ref>''Justice League Adventures'' #12</ref>

*In the alternate "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" timeline, the character is a hero going by the name '''Citizen Cold'''. He retains his current wardrobe and weaponry, and is Central City's main hero, with a museum similar to the [[Flash Museum]], and a Rogues Gallery similar to that of the Flash, though he has killed some of his opponents. It is hinted that his heroics are a cover to hide a terrible secret.<ref name="fpcc1">''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> He is contacted by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to join in the fight against [[Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. When [[Thomas Wayne|Batman]] refuses to join, Citizen Cold declines as well.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> After Citizen Cold defeats [[Mr. Freeze|Mister Freeze]], he returns home and sees a news report that his sister, [[Golden Glider|Lisa]], has been arrested for killing their brutal father. When [[Wally West]] discovers Citizen Cold's true identity, that of a former low-level criminal, Citizen Cold confronts him before he can reveal this information, and freezes Wally in a block of ice.<ref name="fpcc1"/> Later, Citizen Cold invites [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]] to dinner, but it is interrupted by calls that his sister Lisa has been kidnapped by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. Citizen Cold tries to rescue Lisa, but the Rogues attack him for revenge on what he did to them. Citizen Cold is too late and Lisa is killed. Citizen Cold is injured while escaping and collapses outside his car near Iris.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Iris then brings him to her home. After he recovers, he gives her a key to his penthouse, and an offer to join him when he leaves Central City. He then goes after the Rogues, killing them all for what they did to his sister. When he returns home, he is confronted by Iris and the Pied Piper, who had revealed to her his murder of Wally. Citizen Cold attempts to kill Pied Piper, but Iris uses one of his own weapons to freeze him in a block of ice, just as he did to Wally.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>

* At the time when the "Forever Evil" storyline was happening, Grid access the files of Rhonda Pineda where the [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]] version of Leonard Snart was a police officer alongside Mick Rory where they have been pursuing [[Johnny Quick|Jonathan Allen]] and Rhonda. When Jonathan and Rhonda wanted the two of them to fight to the death upon being captured, Mick won the fight only for him to be killed by Jonathan anyway.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #26</ref>

Captain Cold first appears being confronted by the Flash in Central City, with the Flash dodging blasts of ice from his cold guns and demanding Mirror Master's location. When the Flash shoves Cold's guns against his shoulder and legs in midblast, freezing him in place, Cold hastily relents. He reveals the location of a villains bar called World's End in Keystone City where Mirror Master should be at.As Flash leaves, Cold asks him to "Do what you have to with Mirror Master but go easy on the rest of 'em, yeah? Heroes weren't the only ones lost in [[Metropolis]], you know?" The Flash leaves and Cold has not been seen since.

====Live action====
* Captain Cold has also appeared in live-action form in the 1990s ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode "Captain Cold". He was played by actor [[Michael Campbell (musician and actor)|Michael Champion]]. Here Captain Cold (named Leonard Wynters and costumed in a [[trenchcoat]]) was an infamous albino hitman, who uses a nuclear-powered freeze weapon to kill his victims. He was hired by Central City crime boss Jimmy Swain ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) to kill local mob bosses and then the Flash. Flash managed to capture Captain Cold, who was taken to jail, but later managed to escape.

* Cold appears, face unseen, in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "Prophecy" as part of a group assembled by [[Toyman]]. He is assigned to kill [[Bart Allen|Bart "Impulse" Allen]].

* [[Wentworth Miller]] portrays Leonard Snart / Captain Cold as a recurring villain on [[The CW]]'s ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/18/the-flash-prison-break-star-to-play-captain-cold|title=The Flash: Prison Break Star To Play Captain Cold|last=Fowler|first=Matt|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=July 18, 2014|accessdate=July 18, 2014}}</ref> While Cisco was the one who gave Snart the moniker of Captain Cold, he refers to himself as simply 'Cold'. He uses a stolen 'cold gun' from S.T.A.R. Labs which freezes anything at absolute zero, being one of the only weapons known to hurt or even kill The Flash. As revealed in the series, his father abused him and his sister [[Golden Glider|Lisa]] as children, and was convicted for [[domestic violence]]. Leonard then turned to a life of crime before attending high school. After stealing his signature 'cold gun', Captain Cold tries to steal a kodak diamond multiple times before finally succeeding, and then derailing a train to distract the Flash. After he is forced to stand down and withdraw during his first confrontation with the Flash thanks to the interference of Cisco Ramon, he recruits his former colleague, [[Heat Wave (comics)|Mick Rory / Heat Wave]], to join forces against the new hero and kill him. He gives Rory a handheld flamethrower dubbed the 'heat gun' because of Mick's obsession with fire. The two end up kidnapping Caitlin Snow and threaten to kill her unless The Flash meets them in the city for a battle of fire and ice which proves to the world that The Flash is real. Barry manages to defeat his adversaries by tricking them into firing their weapons at each other which crosses the streams of the two guns and cancels them out. The two are arrested and sent to Iron Heights but they escape the prison truck with the aid of Snart's sister Lisa Snart / Golden Glider. It turned out Lisa was part of Cold's plan as a failsafe. They blackmail Cisco Ramon into recreating their weapons and then determining the Flash's identity by holding his brother hostage, forcing Barry to make a deal with Snart where Snart will keep Barry's identity secret (even from Mick and Lisa) and not kill any innocent people in exchange for Barry not trapping them in the Pipeline prison. Barry later enlists the Snarts' help to transfer the metahumans to the Ferris Aircraft, because was the only person besides Barry that could stop them, but Leonard and Lisa sabotaged the plan letting them escape, so that they would owe him and one day join his Rogues. He appeared briefly in the season one finale episode. He returned in full in "Family of Rogues", when he was blackmailed into working with his father after Snart Snr. planted a bomb in Lisa to ensure his son's cooperation, but Barry was able to work with Snart to infiltrate the gang and disable the bomb, Snart killing his father in retaliation. In "Running to Stand Still," Weather Wizard breaks Snart and the Trickster out of prison and offers them a chance to team up and kill the Flash, but Snart refuses and warns Barry as repayment for saving his sister.
