'''Captain Cold''', also known as '''Leonard Snart''', is a comic book villain created by [[John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] for [[The Flash]] comic book, and is one of the scarlet speedster's enemies. He got his name after his parka costume and the "Cold Gun" he wields. A fan favourite, Captain Cold has been the bitter enemy of the Silver-Age Flash [[Barry Allen]] and both friend and enemy to the modern-day Flash [[Wally West]].

Known for being a sympathetic villain in the [[Enemies of the Flash|Flash's Rogues Gallery]], Captain Cold can chat over a cup of coffee whilst planning a heist against The [[Keystone City]] Bank over the weekend. Cold began his career shortly after Barry Allen's debut as the second Flash. He was the second supervillain to face the Silver-Age Flash in ''Showcase #8''. (February 1959)

==Character History==

Leonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather, who worked in an ice truck. When his grandfather died, Len grew tired of his father's abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire. This visor design would later be adapted by Snart into his trademark costume. In recent years he added a radio receiver to them which picked up the police band to monitor local law enforcement. Snart and the other thugs were captured by the Flash and imprisoned, but Leonard Snart is a man who holds a grudge. He decided to go solo, but knew he had to do something about the local hero, the Flash.

Snart read an article that theorized that the energy emissions of a [[cyclotron]] could interfere with the Flash's speed. He designed a weapon to harness that power and broke into a cyclotron lab, intending to use the device to charge up his experimental gun. As he was finishing his experiment, a security guard surprised Snart. Intending to use his gun only to scare the guard, he inadvertently pulled the trigger and discovered that his weapon had been altered in a way he had never imagined. The moisture in the air around the guard froze, turning him into a human ice cube. Intrigued by this twist of fate, Snart donned a [[parka]] and the aforementioned visor and declared himself as Captain Cold - the man who mastered absolute zero. Snart then went about committing a series of non-lethal crimes. But after Barry Allen's death, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Captain Cold became a [[bounty hunter]] with his sister Lisa, the [[Golden Glider]].

During the events of ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Captain Cold lost his soul to [[Neron]], but Wally West brought it back to the land of the living. He soon returned to crime, this time a member of Wally's Rogues Gallery. The Golden Glider had abandoned her bounty hunter career and had started partnering with a series of thugs who she dressed in a costume, armed with a copy of Captain Cold's signature Cold Gun, and called [[Chillblaine]]. Already distraught over the death of her lover, the Top, it seemed that the supposed death of her brother pushed her over the edge. But the last Chillblaine was a little smarter and more vicious. He murdered the Golden Glider, prompting Captain Cold to hunt him down, torture him and kill him by freezing his outer layer of skin and then pushing him off a high rise building. Not long after that, Snart was framed by a new incarnation of [[Mister Element]]. He used his Element Gun to simulate Cold's gun, using ice and cold to murder several police officers before Captain Cold and the Flash discovered who was actually responsible. With the death of his sister, and having killed Chillblaine and Mr. Element in vengeance, Cold has again become an unrepentant criminal.

Most recently Captain Cold was declared the leader of the Flash's Rogue's Gallery. His skill and experience have made him a strong leader to the likes of the [[Weather Wizard]], the new [[Trickster (comics)|The Trickster]], the new [[Mirror Master]], and the [[Owen Mercer|new Captain Boomerang]]. Len seems to have taken the young Captain Boomerang under his wing, after the elder Boomerang was recently killed. Tabloids rumoured that Captain Cold's sister, the Golden Glider, was Boomerang's mother, making him Captain Cold's nephew. This turned out to be false, however, as the new Boomerang's mother has been revealed to be [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Bart Allen]]. Despite his more ruthless nature as of late, Captain Cold's heart isn't completely frozen... evidenced by having sent flowers to honor [[Sue Dibny]], murdered wife of the [[Elongated Man]].

Traditionally, Captain Cold was driven by three things: money, women, and the desire to beat Barry Allen. Although not the lech that Captain Boomerang was, Len Snart has an eye for the ladies, particularly models. When Barry Allen died, Captain Cold drifted for a while, jumping back and forth over the lines of crime and justice. He was captured by the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and served time in the [[Suicide Squad]], worked with his sister as a bounty hunter (Golden Snowball Recoveries), and, with his longtime friend and sometimes nemesis [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], encountered [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] of the [[Justice League]]. He has teamed up with various villains over the years other than the many Rogues... including [[Catwoman]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His favorite baseball team is the [[Chicago Cubs]]. "Plays 'em regular and dumb," according to Mark Shaw, [[Manhunter (comics)#Mark Shaw|the Manhunter]].

Cold takes his position as head of the Rogues very seriously. He employs a no-drugs rule (evidenced by his brutal beating of [[Mirror Master]] for his cocaine habit), docks pay for senseless violence (a 90% payout cut for the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]'s antics with stray dogs and T-bombs), and will kill only on certain occasions (he killed the [[The Top (comics)|Top]] for setting the newer rogues against him and his set of [[Rogues (comics)|rogues]]).

Captain Cold was not entirely as cold hearted as his name suggests. He deeply cared for his sister, aka the Golden Glider, and looked out for the well being of his fellow Rogues at all times, going so far as to arrange a secret funeral for Captain Boomerang. Even after killing the supervillain Chillblaine in revenge for his sisters murder, he was still sitting at his coffee table, lost in a bottle of brews and unable to even open the door for his usual prostitute, realizing, "My heart's not always made of ice."

Not to be mistaken for [[Mr. Freeze]] AKA Mr. Zero, from [[Batman]]'s Rogues Gallery, the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] I, II or III, or Coldsnap of the [[Masters of Disaster (comics)|Masters of Disaster]]. Being called Mr. Freeze in particular infuriates him.

==Costume and Weapons==

Captain Cold's costume has stayed virtually the same over the last fifty years. Slight variants include:

* A white [[holster]] instead of the traditional yellow
* A [[visor]] with a single eye slit rather than the traditional individual eye slits (during his work with the Suicide Squad)
* The white "frost" on his [[parka]] painted or sewn onto it, but some variants have it as an additional piece of white cloth that loosely sits over the top of the parka
* The freeze gun is a [[magenta]] colored pistol with one main [[barrel]] and two to four tubes also emitting from it. Although it has been drawn in a multitude of ways by DC artists, this basic original design has always been kept.
* In the [[Challenge of the SuperFriends]] cartoon, Captain Cold was depicted as having pale blue skin. In ''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]'' television series he was an albino. Neither of these designs were true to the original comic book version of Leonard Snart

==Other media==
''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'', Captain Cold appears as a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom]] voiced by [[Dick Ryal]] and [[Michael Bell]].

Captain Cold has also appeared in live action form, in the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[television series]], ''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]'' . He was played by actor Michael Champion. Here Captain Cold was an infamous mercenary costumed in a [[trenchcoat]] who used a nuclear-powered freeze weapon to kill his victims. He was hired by Central City Crime Boss Jimmy Swain ([[Jeffery Combs]]) to kill local mob bosses and then the Flash. Initially successful in freezing his adversary, he later was confronted by the Flash once more when he recovered from the attack. When Captain Cold was arrested, he managed to escape with a special freezing tool in his glasses to break his cell lock and special freezing grenades to disorient the police as he escaped. In their final showdown, Flash used a specialized heating belt to regulate his body's temperature and a mirror to reflect the freeze blast back at Cold, freezing the villain to death.

[[Image:CC1.jpg|right|thumb|Captain Cold as he appears in Justice League.]]Captain Cold appeared on an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' called "Flash and Substance" in [[February 2006]], voiced by [[Lex Lang]], where he teamed up with Captain Boomerang, the Trickster, and Mirror Master with an assault to defeat the Flash in the [[Flash Museum]]. His personality in the animated show emphasizes his blue-collar, middle-age approach to being a costumed villain: he moans about his wife nagging him for the mortgage payment (in the comics, he has never been married), and he drinks milk to ease the pain of an ulcer. He was defeated when [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] froze him with a water hose as he fired his ice gun. Previous to this he had made two appearances in the animated-continuity comic ''Justice League Adventures''.

It should be noticed that his parka resembles his Superfriends outfit, only without the blue skin.
