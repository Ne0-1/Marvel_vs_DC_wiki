'''Captain Cold''', real name '''Leonard Snart''', is a comic book villain created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] as one of the rogues of [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. He is a leader of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. A fan favorite, Captain Cold has served as a bitter enemy to the Silver-Age Flash [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], both enemy and grudging friend to the modern-day Flash [[Wally West]], and one of the killers of the fourth Flash [[Bart Allen]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Captain Cold|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 67|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017|postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Cold was the second supervillain to face the Silver-Age Flash in ''Showcase #8'' (February 1957).

[[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked Captain Cold as #27.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/27.html |title=Captain Cold is Number 27 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref>

==Personality==
Cold takes his position as head of the Rogues very seriously on Andy and Chances show. He employs a no-drugs rule (evidenced by his brutal beating of [[Mirror Master]] for his cocaine habit), docks pay for senseless violence (a 90% payout cut for the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]'s antics with stray dogs and T-bombs), and will kill only on certain occasions (he killed the Top for setting the newer rogues against him and his set of [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]), leading the Rogues in their 'code of honor' and refusing to kill women or children.

Captain Cold was not entirely as cold-hearted as his name suggests. He deeply cared for his sister, aka the Golden Glider, and looks out for the well being of his fellow Rogues at all times, going so far as to arrange a secret funeral for Captain Boomerang. After killing the supervillain Chillblaine in revenge for his sister's murder, he is later shown sitting at his coffee table drinking alcohol, and unable to open the door for his usual prostitute, realizing that his "heart's not always cold".

Although generally portrayed as rough around the edges at best, and known for his blunt attitude towards women, Cold has been shown to have a surprisingly moral streak at times. When circumstances have forced him to team up with the Flash, he has kept his word and avoided opportunities to stab Flash in the back even after the immediate crisis has been dealt with, admitting in private that he respects his enemy even if he operates on the other side of the law from him.

==Fictional character biography==
Leonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather, who worked in an ice truck later befriending Lightning thunderstein. When his grandfather died, Len grew tired of his father's abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire. This visor design would later be adapted by Snart into his trademark costume. In recent years he has added a radio receiver to them which picks up the police band to monitor local law enforcement. Snart and the other thugs were captured by the Flash and imprisoned. Snart decided to go solo, but knew he had to do something about the local hero, the Flash.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Snart read an article that theorized that the energy emissions of a [[cyclotron]] could interfere with the Flash's speed. He designed a weapon to harness that power and broke into a cyclotron lab, intending to use the device to charge up his experimental gun. As he was finishing his experiment, a security guard surprised Snart. Intending to use his gun only to scare the guard, he inadvertently pulled the trigger and discovered that his weapon had been altered in a way he had never imagined. The moisture in the air around the guard froze. Intrigued by this twist of fate, Snart donned a [[Anorak|parka]] and the aforementioned visor and declared himself to be Captain Cold - the man who mastered absolute zero. Snart then committed a series of non-lethal crimes, on one occasion placing the city in suspended animation in an attempt to force Iris West to marry him as he had fallen in love with her when he saw her in the prison, but the Flash got through a wall of ice and was able to reverse the process. He later fell in love with a newscaster, and competed with [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] (in his first appearance) over her in a crime spree, but they were both beaten by the Flash. But after Barry Allen's death, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Captain Cold became a [[bounty hunter]] with his sister Lisa, the [[Golden Glider]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

During the events of ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Captain Cold lost his soul to [[Neron]] but Wally West brought it back to the land of the living. He soon returned to crime, this time a member of Wally's Rogues Gallery. The Rogues had first been assembled when another Flash foe, the super-intelligent [[Gorilla Grodd]] had broken them out of jail to distract the Flash. The Golden Glider had abandoned her bounty hunter career and had started partnering with a series of thugs who she dressed in a costume, armed with a copy of Captain Cold's signature Cold Gun, and called [[Chillblaine]]. Already distraught over the death of her lover, the [[Top (comics)|Top]], it seemed that the supposed death of her brother pushed her over the edge. But the last Chillblaine was a little smarter and more vicious. He murdered the Golden Glider, prompting Captain Cold to hunt him down, torture him and kill him by freezing his outer layer of skin and then pushing him off a high rise building. Not long after that, Snart was framed by a new incarnation of [[Mister Element]]. He used his Element Gun to simulate Cold's gun, using ice and cold to murder several police officers before Captain Cold and the Flash discovered who was actually responsible. With the death of his sister, and having killed Chillblaine and Mr. Element in vengeance, Cold has again become an unrepentant criminal. However, during a confrontation with [[Brother Grimm]], Cold actually worked with Wally West to defeat the powerful magic user, although this was mainly because he and [[Mirror Master]] had been betrayed by Grimm and wanted revenge.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Most recently Captain Cold was declared the leader of the Flash's Rogue's Gallery. His skill and experience have made him a strong leader to the likes of the [[Weather Wizard]], the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], the new [[Mirror Master]], and the [[Owen Mercer|new Captain Boomerang]]. Len seems to have taken the young Captain Boomerang under his wing, after the elder Boomerang was recently killed. Tabloids rumoured that Captain Cold's sister, the Golden Glider, was Boomerang's mother, making him Captain Cold's nephew. This turned out to be false, however, as the new Boomerang's mother has been revealed to be [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Bart Allen]]. Despite his more ruthless nature as of late, Captain Cold's heart is not completely frozen, evidenced by having sent flowers to honor [[Sue Dibny]], murdered wife of the [[Elongated Man]].

Traditionally, Captain Cold is driven by three things: money, women, and the desire to beat Barry Allen. Although not the lech that Captain Boomerang was, Len Snart has an eye for the ladies, particularly models. When Barry Allen died, Captain Cold drifted for a while, jumping back and forth over the lines of crime and justice. He was captured by the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and served time in the [[Suicide Squad]], worked with his sister as a bounty hunter (Golden Snowball Recoveries), and, with his longtime friend and sometimes nemesis [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], encountered [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] of the [[Justice League]]. He has teamed up with various villains over the years other than the many Rogues. These include [[Catwoman]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His favorite baseball team is the [[Chicago Cubs]]. "Plays 'em regular and dumb," according to Mark Shaw, the [[Mark Shaw (Manhunter)|Manhunter]].

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later]], he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]).  Though Inertia was defeated, Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Heat Wave, Mirror Master and Abra Kadabra killed Bart with a combined barrage of their elemental weapons. He, Heat Wave, and Weather Wizard seemed to express guilt, however, after learning the identity of the Flash and how young he was.

===Salvation Run===
Captain Cold is one of the exiled villains featured in [[Salvation Run]] along with his fellow Rogues: [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].

{{Main|Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge}}
Captain Cold and the Rogues briefly joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' story, however, Cold and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #1</ref> Cold and his group is challenged by a new set of Rogues, formed by Libra to be their replacements. The new group, having kidnapped Cold's father, challenge the Rogues, and are defeated and killed. Cold goes to his father, talking to him about the abuse he suffered, and the fate of his sister. After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #2</ref> The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #3</ref> In "Final Crisis" #7, someone that looks like Captain Cold appears as a [[Justifiers|Justifier]] and is seen fighting the Female Furies alongside the other Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control.

===The Flash: Rebirth===
In ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' mini-series, Captain Cold is seen with the other Rogues, reading about Barry Allen's return and telling that need more of the Rogues.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> The Rogues are still debating Allen's return with Cold saying its time to pull out their contingency plan that [[Mirror Master|Scudder]] came up with stating, ''"In case The Flash returns, break glass."''<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (February 2010)</ref>

===Blackest Night===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
The Rogues realize that the bodies of various dead Rogues are missing and prepare to fight them. Captain Cold knows that his sister, the Golden Glider, is among the reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] but is still ready to lead the Rogues against the zombies.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)</ref> He is confronted by the Black Lantern Glider, who attempts to use his feelings of love for her against him. However, Captain Cold manages to suppress these feelings long enough for him to fight back, freezing her within a block of ice.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> He subsequently kills Owen Mercer by throwing him into a pit with his Black Lantern father when he learns that Owen has been feeding people to his father in the belief that consuming flesh will restore him to life, informing Owen that Rogues do not kill women and children.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)</ref>

===The New 52===
In this timeline of ''[[The New 52]]'', Captain Cold is reintroduced as a younger man than in the previous timeline. His origin remains the same, however, his sister Lisa has not been the Golden Glider, and is instead dying of [[cancer]]. Upon learning that the hospital does not have enough energy to power a laser that could save her life, because of an EMP seemingly caused by the Flash, Cold blames him for everything that has happened to him, including a falling out with the Rogues, and decides to break the rules of their "game" and kill the Flash. Captain Cold has undergone experiments that have given him ice-based metahuman powers, including the ability to slow down the molecules around him, creating a field of inertia that reduces the Flash's speed to human level, allowing Captain Cold to touch him and effortlessly beat him.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #6 (February 2012)</ref> He and the Rogues are set to return,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 4 #7 (March 2012)</ref> but later defeated them with help from Flash, and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] <ref>''The Flash annual'' #1 </ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like the majority of The Flash's Rogues, Snart has no real super power. He instead relies on his cold guns and instincts. Over the years Snart has modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as:
* A cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly.
* Creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks. Cold uses this ability to slow down The Flash's movements.
* Bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain. Cold used this to kill Chill Blaine who murdered Cold's sister to make him suffer as much as possible.
* Creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the Flash.
* Forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies. Used to kill Chill Blaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible.
* An "Ice Grenade" which was stated to "turn this place into an iceberg". Used to freeze everything in a large radius, used to freeze the whole of Iron heights during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.
* Creating "Mirages" out of Extreme cold like intense heat can cause mirages.

Fellow ice-based villain [[Mr. Freeze]] has noted that Cold is the only cold-themed villain in the DC Universe to have mastered 'absolute zero' with his weapons.

In the new 52 universe Captain Cold has undergone experiments that have given him ice-based metahuman powers, including:
* the ability to slow down the molecules around him, 
*the ability to create a field of inertia that reduces the Flash's speed to human level, allowing Captain Cold to touch him and effortlessly beat him.

==Costume==
Like his fellow Rogues, Captain Cold's costume was developed by [[Paul Gambi]], personal Tailor to the Rogues, allowing Cold to withstand the rigors of his Cold abilities. For 50 years his costume has stayed virtually the same. Slight variants include:
* A white [[holster]] instead of the traditional yellow
* A [[visor]] with a single eye slit rather than the traditional individual eye slits (during his work with the Suicide Squad)
* A [[parka]] instead of the traditional spandex material
* The white "frost" on his parka painted or sewn onto it, but some variants have it as an additional piece of white cloth that loosely sits over the top of the parka
* The freeze gun is a [[magenta]] colored pistol with one main [[barrel]] and two to four tubes also emitting from it. Although it has been drawn in a multitude of ways by DC artists, this basic original design has always been kept.
