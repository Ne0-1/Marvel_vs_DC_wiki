While there, Seth healed them, and gave them elemental superhuman powers, calling them '''Earth Lord''', '''Skyhawk''' and '''Wind Warrior'''. 

Employed by Seth these three humans, now known collectively as '''Earth Force''', worked as pawns for vengeance. Seth tricked Earth Force into thinking that [[Hogun]] was a menace, and they fought [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and Hogun, until Thor exposes Seth's evil nature to them. Their first mission fails and they reconciled with Thor and Hogun, and were transported back to Seth's dimension. They fought Seth's warriors and were captured by Seth's forces.
