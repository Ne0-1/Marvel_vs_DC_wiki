'''Master Man''' is the name of three [[fictional characters]] that appear in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original Master Man ('''Wilhelm Lohmer''') first appears in the title ''Giant-Size [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #1 (June 1975) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]]. The second version ('''Axl Nacht'''), first appears in ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'' #11  (Feb. 1991) and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], and a third version ('''Max Lohmer''') debuts in ''[[Captain America]]'' #18 (July, 2006) by [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Steve Epting]].

==Fictional character biography==
Wilhelm "Willie" Lohmer first appears in the title ''Giant-Size [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]''. Portrayed as a physically frail [[German American Bund|American Bundist]]<ref>''Giant Size Invaders'' identifies him as a Bundist, suggesting he is American; ''Captain America: Medusa Effect'' confirms it, identifying him as coming from Yorkville, New York</ref> and [[Nazi]] sympathiser, Lohmer agrees to participate in an experiment in which he is subjected to the Nazi version of the [[Captain America|Super-Soldier Serum]]. Endowed with physical abilities that exceed those of [[Captain America]], the character is given a costume and the alias ''Master Man'', with Lohmer to be the first of a new [[Aryan]] "master race". As Master Man, Lohmer battles the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] superheroes the ''Invaders'', but is defeated when his new abilities prove to be temporary.<ref>''Giant-Size Invaders'' #1 (June 1975)</ref>

The character reappears in a two part story in the title ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'', and with Nazi allies [[Brain Drain (comics)|Brain Drain]], [[U-Man]] and Skyshark plans to [[sabotage]] [[New York City]] with a new super weapon. The plan, however, is foiled by [[time travel]]ling [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the [[Liberty Legion]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' Annual #1 (Jan. 1976) & ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #20 (Oct. 1976)</ref>

A revitalised Master Man, now possessing even greater abilities, reappears in the title ''Invaders'' and [[ambush]]es the superteam while they are flying over [[Europe]]. During the course of a multi-issue storyline involving the Invaders' incarceration and eventual escape from a prison in the German city of [[Berlin]], Master Man meets Julia Koenig, who courtesy of an accident gains abilities similar to his own and becomes the Nazi heroine [[Warrior Woman (Marvel Comics)|Warrior Woman]]. At the insistence of [[Adolf Hitler]], leader of the [[Third Reich]], the two are to be married, his logic being that they are the progenitors of a new race. The ceremony, however, is interrupted when the priest is killed by rubble from a building damaged during a battle between the Invaders and [[Germany|German]] troops. Master Man and Warrior Woman retreat when confronted by the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], who becomes enraged when his ward [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] is wounded by gunfire.<ref>''Invaders'' #16 - 21 (May - Oct. 1977)</ref>

Master Man continues to be a perennial foe for the Invaders, battling the team while disguised as the hero the [[Destroyer (Timely Comics)|Destroyer]]<ref>''Invaders'' #34 (Nov. 1978)</ref> and as part of a team formed by the [[Japan]]ese [[spy]] [[Lady Lotus]], the [[Super-Axis]].<ref>''Invaders'' #41 (Sep. 1979)</ref>

It is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] in the title ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'' that near the end of World War II, Nazi [[Baron Strucker]] placed Master Man and Warrior Woman in [[suspended animation]] in a hidden laboratory, thereby "preserving" the Nazi dream for use at a later time. Master Man is revived by scientist Axl Nacht, and at Nacht's direction, the character abducts the original Human Torch and Ann Raymond ([[Toro (comics)|Toro]]'s [[widow]]) - their [[blood]] being necessary to help revive Warrior Woman, who had suffered [[brain damage]].  Nacht betrays Master Man when it is revealed that his father first cared for the two superbeings while in suspended animation, and unknowingly instilled in the younger Nacht an obsession with Warrior Woman. When Namor the Sub-Mariner, former founding member of the Invaders, finds the laboratory, he battles Master Man, until the Nazi loses his abilities and reverts to Wilhelm Lohmer. Nacht steals Master Man's abilities for himself, and has apparently also won the affections of the revived but unstable Warrior Woman. Namor rescues the prisoners as Lohmer destroys the laboratory, although no bodies are found in the wreckage.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #9 - 12 (Dec. 1990- Mar. 1991)</ref>

Lohmer reappears in the title ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'', now an old man living in [[Switzerland]] and wishing to make amends for his past actions. The character dies when shielding Cable from a [[bullet]] fired by a member of the organization the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].<ref>''Cable'' #52 (Mar. 1998)</ref>

The nephew of Lohmer, Max Lohmer, appears in the fifth volume of ''Captain America''. Lohmer leads a gang of [[Neo-Nazi]]s called the ''Master Men'', who are empowered with a weaker version of the Super-Soldier Serum by arch villain the [[Red Skull]]. The gang embark on a rampage in [[London]] until defeated by Captain America and heroes [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] and [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5, #20 (Sep. 2005)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Wilhelm Lohmer was a frail human until exposed to the Nazi variation of [[Abraham Erskine|Professor Erskine]]'s Super-Soldier Serum, and receives enhanced physical abilities. The Nazi version of the process is amplified and as a result Lohmer receives greater abilities than those of Captain America, including superior strength; stamina; durability; speed and flight. The Serum, however, was unstable and at times Lohmer would revert to his normal self.

==Other versions==

===Heroes Reborn===
In the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, a version of Master Man, named Alexander appears as an super-powered ally to the [[Red Skull]] promoting [[Nazism]] in the present day, and is seen attacking [[Nick Fury]] (and is revealed as an [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]]).<ref>''Heroes Reborn'' #1/2</ref> This version of Master Man later develops the delusion that he is the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and forms a cult in which his gamma-powered minions enslave the population of California.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Rebel'' #1 (January 2000)</ref>

==In other media==

===Video games===
Although Wilhelm Lohmer didn't appear in the [[Captain America: Super Soldier|Captain America game]], the [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] counterpart to [[Abraham Erskine]]'s Super Soldier Serum, '''Mastermann Project''', was revealed in the first hidden reel by [[Armin Zola]]. He had planned to manufacture the Serum using [[Red Skull|Johann Schmidt]]'s blood, but is later destroyed by Captain America later in the game.
