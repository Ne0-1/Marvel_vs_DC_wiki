Another unrelated '''Master Man''' appeared in the pages of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[The Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]''.  This Master Man was a [[Nazi]] analogue of [[Superman]] who was paired with [[Warrior Woman]] (a Nazi analogue of [[Wonder Woman]]) as members of the Battle-Axis.  Both characters resurfaced in the modern era and battled the former Invader [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and his allies, and were presumed killed.

Master Man didn't die, but had been living in Switzerland. Now an old man, he reflected on his life and attempted to make ammends for his evil doings in World War II. He was killed by a member of the Hellfire club by jumping in front of a bullet meant for Cable.
