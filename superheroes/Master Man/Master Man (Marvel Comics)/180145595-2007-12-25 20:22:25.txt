'''Master Man (Wilhelm Lohmer)''' is a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[supervillain]] which appeared in the pages of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[The Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]''. Created by Nazi scientist [[Brain Drain (comics)|Brain Drain]], Master Man was a Nazi analogue of [[Captain America]] (and [[Superman]]) who was paired with [[Warrior Woman]], (a Nazi analogue of [[Wonder Woman]]) as members of the [[Battle-Axis]].
 
===Fictional character biography===
The story of Wilhelm Lohmer's early life has never been told.

Wilhelm was an American Bundist of German descent, loyal to the Nazis, but he was physically weaker than his comrades. It was precisely for this reason that he was chosen to be subjected to the Nazi version of the [[Super-Soldier Serum]]. Although the formula was a derivative of the original Super-Soldier serum that gave Captain America his powers, Lohmer gained abilities exceeding those of Captain America.

Christened '''Master Man''', the Nazi agent became a favorite of [[Adolf Hitler]] and he participated in many Nazi campaigns, often the prime adversary of his counterpart, Captain America, and his allies, the hero team Invaders.

Later, Hitler hastily decided that Master Man and similar Nazi agent Warrior Woman should be married, even attempted to performed the ceremony himself. However, she considered Master Man to be a dolt and was repulsed by the thought of marrying him.

As the allied guns pounded Berlin near the close of the war, Master Man and Warrior Woman were placed in [[suspended animation]] in separate, secret laboratories within the city. Through the foresight of the Nazi [[Baron Strucker]], these two hidden facilities had been built for this very purpose. Baron Strucker knew that Hitler's regime would fall, so he devised a way for the two greatest warriors of the war to be preserved, ensuring that "the dream" would be reborn in the future.

More recently, with the reunification of Germany, the slumbering warriors were awakened, only to be attacked by [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. After Warrior Woman left Lohmer to be with the [[#Axl Nacht|second Master Man]], Lohmer blew up the lab they were in seemingly killing them all. However, no bodies were found.

After the explosion Lohmer was found by one of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s acolytes. Injured after the explosion his powers were depleted and he had aged rapidly. Now an old man living in [[Switzerland]] as one of Cable's followers, he reflected on his life and attempted to make amends for his evil doings in World War II. He was later killed by a member of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] when he jumped in front of a bullet meant for Cable. Cable then buried Lohmer's body in the Swiss Alps.

===Powers and abilities===
Wilhelm Lohmer was exposed to the Nazi version of the Super-Soldier Serum that produced [[Captain America]]. This version gave Master Man greatly enhanced physical abilities greater than Captain America's as well as the power to leap fantastic distances and withstand heat and flames without ill effect, but the serum was unstable. At times, he would even revert to his weaker self.

'''Axl Nacht''' known as '''Herr Nacht''' (Mister Night) and later '''Gotteskrieger''' became the second Master Man using a recreated Nazi Super Soldier formula.

Herr Nacht's physical abilities were greatly increased but whether he benefits from any of the other superhuman powers has yet to be revealed.

===Fictional character biography===
Not much has been revealed about Herr Nacht's background. After Baron Strucker's funding ran out, Herr Nacht took over the financing of Master Man and Warrior Woman's preservation. Herr Nacht's father was involved in the project from the beginning, over 40 years ago. Over those years, the project was technically managed by [[Doctor Kraus]], a German scientist whose life had been saved by Herr Nacht's father. From photographs given to him by his father, Herr Nacht fell in love with Warrior Woman.

Determined to have Warrior Woman as his bride, Herr Nacht ordered Doctor Kraus, to duplicate the formula that created the first Master Man. The process was successful.

With the reunification of Germany, Herr Nacht decided it was time to revive Master Man and Warrior Woman. He was determined to use their powers to form a New Reich, with himself as the leader. Donning a costume and calling himself as the new '''Master Man''', Herr Nacht convinced Warrior Woman to ally with him. A disturbed and rejected Willie "Master Man" Lohmer blew up himself, Warrior Woman and Nacht.

Nacht and Warrior Woman have both been seen since as members of [[Axis Mundi]] with Nacht having taken on the identity of '''Gotteskrieger'''.

==Master Race==
The '''Master Race (or Master Men)''' are a group of [[Neo-Nazi]] thugs recruited, and enhanced, by [[Aleksander Lukin]]/[[Red Skull]] and lead by [[#Willie Lohmer|Willie Lohmer]]'s great nephew, '''Max Lohmer'''. 

The Master Race were exposed to another recreated version of the formula which changed Willie Lohmer. The Men's physical abilities were greatly increased but not to level of the original. However, the leader of the group Max Lohmer, when angered, was able to leap with great power almost to the point of flight. <ref>''Captain America Vol. 5 #20''</ref>

The group fought against Captain America, [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]], and [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] in [[London]]. Their were defeated but their ultimate fate is unknown.
