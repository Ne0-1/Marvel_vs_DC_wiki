A [[supervillain]] called '''Master Man''' appeared in the pages of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[The Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]''. This Master Man was a [[Nazism|Nazi]] analogue of [[Captain America]] (and [[Superman]]) who was paired with [[Warrior Woman]], (a Nazi analogue of [[Wonder Woman]]) as members of the Battle-Axis. In the comics, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered Master Man and Warrior Woman to marry, and even performed the ceremony himself. She considered Master Man to be a dolt and was repulsed by the thought of marrying him. She turned against him when both characters resurfaced in the modern era and battled the former Invader [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and his allies. Both appeared to be killed.

Master Man did not die, however, but went to live in Switzerland. Now an old man, he reflected on his life and attempted to make amends for his evil doings in [[World War II]]. He was killed by a member of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] when he jumped in front of a bullet meant for [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

A second Master Man known only as "Herr Nacht" (Mister Night) using the same formula was briefly active in the modern era. His fate is unknown.

==Powers==
Wilhelm Lohmer was exposed to the Nazi analogue of the "Super-Soldier Serum" that gave [[Captain America]] his abilities. This version gave Master Man super-strength greater than Captain America's, but was unstable. At times, he would revert to his weaker self.
