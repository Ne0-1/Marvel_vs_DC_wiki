'''Galactus''', sometimes called the '''Devourer of Worlds''' or '''Ravager of Planets''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] within [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] &mdash; prompted by Lee's suggestion to Kirby to "have the [[Fantastic Four|FF]] fight God" <ref>[http://www.ffplaza.com/commcenter/articles/origin.shtml ''Origin of the Fantastic Four Comic Book''] URL last checked 2006-11-26.</ref> &mdash; he first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48. 

==Fictional character history==
{{spoiler}}
===Rebirth===
Originally named Galan of the planet Taa, Galactus is the sole survivor of the [[Big Crunch]] of the universe that existed prior to the current Marvel Universe.  

Galan was a space explorer investigating the impending end of his universe. Eventually, Taa was engulfed by a radiation plague that killed all of its inhabitants save a select few. Galan proposed to his fellow suvivors that they die gloriously by piloting a star-ship directly into the focal point of the Big Crunch.  As Galan approached the [[Cosmic egg|Cosmic Egg]] &mdash; the focal point of the Big Crunch and the source of the life destroying radiation &mdash; his ship and crew were promptly destroyed.  At the moment Galan's universe met its end, the incarnation of that reality's [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] amassed the positive emotions of all living beings in the cosmos to preserve them from eternal damnation, enabling the ''Sentience of the Universe'' — the previous universe's incarnation of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] — to meet with Galan. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/OHOTMU:Data_Corrections_Fantastic_Four_2005 ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Data Corrections Fantastic Four 2005'']. URL last checked 2006-09-01.</ref> <ref> ''Adventures of X-Men'' #12 </ref> Within the Cosmic Egg the ''Sentience of the Universe'' revealed itself to Galan and informed him that though they both would die in the impending cataclysm, they would survive through a joint heir born into the next universe. The ''Sentience of the Universe'' then merged itself with the mortal Galan, establishing Galan as the sole survivor of the ensuing Big Crunch. This union ultimately led to his rebirth in the current universe as Galactus. <ref> ''Super Villain Classics #1'' </ref> 

After the [[Big Bang]] of the current universe, to complete his [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], Galactus was encased in a cocoon of enormous cosmic energies. After millions of years, he emerged as an entity of vast cosmic power who was also necessary for the existence of the newly formed universe. <ref>''Super Villain Classics'' #1</ref>

Galactus is considered one of the five essential entities within the Marvel Universe alongside [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]], and [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. Galactus has been referred to as the "third force of the universe"<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> and "one corner of that great triangle which is the universe" by Eternity and Death, respectively. Eternity and Death each consider Galactus a peer and a sibling, with Death actually referring to Galactus as "husband, father, brother, and son." <ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #257</ref>

===The Devourer of Worlds===
Galactus requires unknown energies obtainable only from certain types of [[planet]]s in order to sustain his life. The suitable type of planet need not be one where life is present, but it must have the potential to support life.  Galactus usually employs a herald to scout the universe for those suitable types of planets.   When the suitable planet is found, Galactus will usually land on the planet's surface and assemble his Elemental Converter, a colossal machine capable of draining all life energy from the planet within minutes.  Galactus has been known to devour planets without the aid of his Elemental Converter on occasion, but the device makes the process more efficient. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #257</ref>   Galactus, seeing himself as a higher being, usually will not avoid a suitable planet simply because it is home to [[Sentience|sentient]] life. Thus, over billions of years he has become one of the most feared beings in the universe, his vast power allowing him to lay waste to innumerable [[Extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial]] [[civilization]]s in his quest for sustenance.

Nevertheless, he is not an [[evil]] being, but rather a force of nature whose feedings are necessary for survival. It is known that Galactus plays a necessary role in the continuum of the Marvel Universe, bringing balance between the two opposing universal forces of Death and Eternity; who are in essence the Yin and Yang of the Marvel universe. Eternity has stated that the universe would fail, falling into stasis then collapsing without Galactus' presence to balance it. <ref> ''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #10 </ref>  It has been suggested by some that his purpose in the universe is to devour planets that have reached an evolutionary peak, although alternative information suggests that he will create a whole new universe at the end of this one, a universe which will be immeasurably greater than the total of the planets he has devoured; thus giving back far more than he has ever taken. <ref> ''Super Villain Classics'' #1 </ref>

===Heralds===

:''Main article: [[Herald of Galactus]]''
Galactus has appointed a number of entities as his [[Herald of Galactus|heralds]], imbuing them with a minuscule portion of his Power Cosmic and sending them to search for edible worlds. Most of his heralds have either rebelled against him, betrayed him or been cast aside for some reason.  

Among his heralds are the [[Fallen One]], [[Silver Surfer]], [[Terrax]], [[Firelord]], [[Air-Walker]], the Air-Walker robot, an Earthwoman named Frankie Raye later known as [[Frankie Raye|Nova]], [[Morg]], [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]], the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] armor, [[Human Torch]], and [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]]. [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]] and [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]] were possibly heralds.

In stories in alternate and parallel realities, Galactus also used other heralds: Plasma, Dark Angel, [[Superman]], [[Dazzler]], [[Golden Oldie]], the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Ardina, [[Starglow]] and [[Dominas]].

In the Ultimate Marvel storyline Gah Lak Tus, as he is known in the Ultimate Universe, the Ultimate version of the Silver Surfer is also used as a herald, while the ultimate version of the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] was built as a warning system for the coming of Gah Lak Tus.

===Attempts to Devour the Earth===
Galactus has threatened to destroy the [[Earth]] on several occasions.  On the first, the Fantastic Four (aided by the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] [[Uatu]] and by Galactus' rebellious herald, the [[Silver Surfer]]) defeated him by threatening him with the [[Ultimate Nullifier]]. Galactus vowed to never again try to harm the Earth.

Nevertheless, he has returned on several occasions, in one instance weakened enough for the Fantastic Four, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]] to defeat him.  Rather than watch him die of hunger, [[Mister Fantastic]] saved him, for which Galactus called him "friend," and vowed Earth need never again fear Galactus, and for which Mr Fantastic was later put on [[galaxy|galactic]] [[Trial (law)|trial]] by the [[Shi'Ar]].

===Temporary Death===
In the ''Galactus: The Devourer'' limited series (1999-2000), Galactus &mdash; starving to death due to his addiction to the life forces of living beings which offer him no sustenance &mdash; was seemingly killed after a battle against the united forces of the [[Silver Surfer]], Avengers, Fantastic Four, [[Firestar]], [[Starjammers]], the [[Shi'ar]] Empire and an armada of other united planets (including even a [[Kree]] starship) when his own Elemental Converter was turned against him.  He died with an ominous warning that his death would allow a great evil to surface. After his death, Galactus' true form was revealed, that of a sentient [[star]].

That great evil emerged in ''Fantastic Four Annual 2001'' in the form of [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], the universal embodiment of destruction and the antithesis of Eternity. It was revealed that most of the energy that Galactus takes from planets was devoted to keeping him imprisoned. If released, Abraxas would eventually destroy the entire [[Multiverse (science)|multiverse]]. Abraxas was defeated only after it was revealed in ''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 2) #49 (vol. 1) #478; January 2002) that Galactus was not truly dead but in his incorporeal star form he would be forever unable to rein in his energies and reclaim form. [[Franklin Richards]] and [[Valeria Richards|Valeria Von Doom]] pooled their vast, [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]-level powers and reconstituted Galactus, but permanently burned out their powers in the revival. Once reconstituted, Galactus easily reclaimed the Ultimate Nullifier from Abraxas and Reed Richards used it to remake the multiverse into one in which Abraxas never escaped. It was in this issue that the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] was revealed to be an aspect of Galactus himself.

==="Rising Storm"===
In the 2005 Fantastic Four storyline ''Rising Storm'', Reed Richards built a weapon that was designed to strip Galactus of the Power Cosmic - this was made possible due to input from [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] who was cosmically aware at the time.  Johnny Storm, as Invisible Man - Herald of Galactus, managed to keep Galactus occupied long enough for Reed and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] to complete construction of the weapon. The weapon actually succeeded in separating the two aspects that comprise Galactus, thus Galan was freed from the Power Cosmic and reduced to his mortal, humanoid form. In tribute to "the indomitable spirit of the humanoid order", Galan willingly exiled himself into an other-universal realm, with the hope that this act would delay the Power Cosmic in finding him.  

This did not last long, however, and as Galactus, he encountered [[Beta Ray Bill]] in the Stormbreaker mini-series shortly after.  The manner in which the Power Cosmic found Galan and reformed Galactus was never revealed.

===Annihilation===
In the ''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' miniseries, written by [[Keith Giffen]], it was revealed that Galactus was not always the sole member of the "Cosmic Balance"; it has been suggested that Galactus was but one of several beings similar to himself.  Due to differing opinions of the powers they had been blessed with, the Balance all but destroyed itself in civil war, with only three remaining - Galactus the Devourer of Worlds, [[Tenebrous]] of the Darkness Between, and [[Aegis (Marvel Comics)|Aegis]] the Lady of All Sorrows.  Able to subdue his darker brethren in the first Kyln, Galactus remained the only extant member of the Balance, until the Annihilation Wave ruptured the Crunch, freeing Tenebrous and Aegis.  Knowing of their escape, Galactus has augmented the [[Silver Surfer]], who is in his employ as Herald once more, and has stated that Tenebrous and Aegis will move against him, indicating awareness.  In Annihilation #1, Tenebrous and Aegis seemingly defeat the [[Silver Surfer]] and Galactus. In the subsequent issue, the incapacitated Galactus and Silver Surfer are revealed as captives in Thanos' starship, where [[Annihilus]] has tasked Thanos with discovering the secret of the Power Cosmic. Annihilation #3 finds Galactus in an unconscious state, while Thanos has harnessed Galactus' cosmic might to utilize him as a weapon of destruction on a large scale.  In Annihilation #4, Thanos attempts to release Galactus from his bonds, as the Titan discovers that Annihilus plans to use Galactus as a cosmic bomb to destroy all life in both the [[Marvel Universe|616-universe]] and the [[Negative Zone]]. As he works to free Galactus, Thanos remarks that he would teleport away once the planet eater was released, as he would not want to be on the receiving end of the Devourer's wrath. However, Thanos meets an untimely end at the hands of Drax the Destroyer before he can release Galactus. In Annihilation #5, Drax frees Silver Surfer which is being held by a fraction of Galactus' power and in turn helps free Galactus himself. In the panel he is reintroduced he utters the words, "KNOW ME ANNIHILUS. KNOW ME AND...KNOW FEAR!" 

==Powers and abilities==
Galactus wields the immeasurable '''Power Cosmic''' and is one of the most powerful entities within the [[Marvel Universe]]; he has even been described as "the most powerful creature in the universe." <ref> ''Annihilation #2'' </ref>  As such, Galactus is able to employ the limitless cosmic energies within him to produce nearly any effect he desires.  

Galactus has displayed a vast array of abilities at his command, which include:  size-alteration, the molecular restructuring, conversion and [[transmutation]] of matter, the [[Energy blast|projection of energy]] with incalculable concussive force or heat, the [[teleportation]] of objects &mdash; even entire [[galaxy|galaxies]] &mdash; across [[space]] and even [[time]], the erection of [[impenetrability|impenetrable]] energy-screens and [[Force field (science fiction)|force fields]], the creation of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|interdimensional]] and [[Universe|intradimensional]] [[Portal (fiction)|portals]] and [[wormhole]]s, virtually unlimited [[telepathy|telepathic]] and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] ability, and [[omniscience|cosmic awareness]] on a universal scale. Galactus has even shown the ability to create sentient [[life]], [[Resurrection|resurrect]] the dead, manipulate mortal [[soul]]s, and remake dead worlds &mdash; including their populations &mdash; in every detail.  

Even Galactus' heralds, whom he has endowed with a minuscule fraction of his awesome power, are able to manipulate matter and energy in ways far beyond human comprehension.  Indeed, Galactus is so powerful he must always wear his armor to help him regulate his internal energies or else they could run rampant with the potential to change him into a star. 

Since Galactus must continuously feed to sustain his energies, his power levels are inconsistent throughout any given period of time. When Galactus' hunger has been recently sated, his powers at the very least rival those possessed by the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]]. A ''fully'' satiated Galactus however, as explained in the [[Secret Wars]] saga, has universal awareness and power levels that are on par with those of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] himself, though it should be noted that Galactus is almost never satiated to full capacity. As such, the longer Galactus goes without feeding, the more his strength, power and universal awareness wane. Within just one month of consuming a suitable planet Galactus' power reduces exponentially-yet even in such a depleted state his powers are still far beyond human comprehension. Going several months between feedings, as he has done on a few occasions in recent years, can bring him to the brink of death and leave him so weakened that he proves vulnerable to direct assaults from superhuman teams such as the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Shi'Ar Imperial Guard]], Avengers and the Fantastic Four.

In the universe's earlier years, Galactus could go without feeding for a century before his hunger substantially weakened him. It is currently unknown why the intervals between his feedings have decreased over millennia. 

As the oldest known living entity in the universe, Galactus possesses arguably the most advanced intellect of all lifeforms in the cosmos. Over the eons and epochs of his existence, Galactus has amassed cosmic knowledge of such universal depth that there is little knowledge that he does not possess. He is aware of every event of cosmic importance, and being an inherent part of the universe, has often and repeatedly confronted entities and events that would compromise the existence of the universe as he knows it. 

Galactus has created and employed perhaps the most advanced technology ever developed. His constructs are of such sophisticated design and engineering that they often replicate some of his inherent abilities, such as intra and inter-dimensional travel and the transmutation of matter on a massive scale. While the capabilities of other beings, such as the Celestials, are widely regarded as one of the most highly evolved and advanced technologies in the cosmos, the sheer scope and magnitude of Galactus' works are unmatched. The Ultimate Nullifier, itself an aspect of Galactus, endows the user with the power to effectively "nullify" anything and everything within the user's ability to conceptualize. [[Taa II]], the home of Galactus, is of such immense size that its expanse encompasses an entire solar system. Indeed, so astounding is Taa II that Reed Richards--considered to be the most brilliant man on Earth--stated that he could spend the entirety of his life studying just one of the rudimentary machines installed by Galactus. 

It can be argued, however, that with such staggering might and vast intellect, Galactus is prone to over-confidence and underestimation of his foes, as he has often been defeated by lesser beings.

[[Image:Bd galactus-visage.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Galactus without his helmet (as seen by a human)]]

==Physical appearance==
Although Galactus is usually depicted in humanoid form, each sentient being perceives him having a form resembling his/her/its own. Hence, humans see Galactus as an enormous armor-clad humanoid, while an amoeba-like species, for example, would perceive Galactus as a gigantic amoeba-like entity. As Galan, Galactus was indeed a humanoid, but his true current form is unknown. As a being who is both abstract entity (e.g. [[Death (comics)|Death]], [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], et al) ''and'' physical creature, Galactus's true form and nature are beyond the capability of any mortal to fully comprehend.

==Alternate realities==
===Epic Illustrated===
[[Epic Illustrated]] published "The Last Galactus Story" by [[John Byrne]].<ref>''Epic Illustrated'' was a magazine printed by Marvel Comics from 1980 - 1986</ref> Set 100,000,000 years in the future, Galactus devours a now uninhabited Earth.  Accompanied by Nova, Galactus then begins a search for a number of inhabited worlds that have disappeared. The story's conclusion was never published, although John Byrne has provided information on his website.<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 Freqently Asked Questions on John Byrne's website]</ref>

===Amalgam Comics===

In the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam Universe]], Galactus merged with [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] to create [[Galactiac]], who devoured planets to replenish his energy cells, but simultaneously shrank parts of them to study at his leisure, much like the early, pre-Crisis Brainiac had done with the city of [[Kandor]]. 

===MC2===

Galactus, accompanied by a new herald named [[Dominas]], appears in the [[MC2]] universe, in the [[Last Planet Standing]] limited series.  <ref>''Last Planet Standing'' #1 - 5</ref>

===Earth X===

Galactus also appears in the non-canon ''[[Earth X]]'' series. In ''Earth X'' Galactus was one of the three essential entities in the universe as he kept the [[Celestials]] in check. By destroying planets, which were really "eggs" of the Celestials, he prevented the Celestials from overpopulating the universe. In its previous incarnation, the universe was brought to a premature end by the overpopulation of Celestials. <ref>''Earth X'' Vol. 1, #1 - 12 (2000 - 2001)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===

Ultimate Galactus, called '''Gah Lak Tus''', was introduced in the [[Ultimate Galactus trilogy]] written by [[Warren Ellis]]. Gah Lak Tus is first mentioned by Ultimate [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], now an early warning system for worlds under threat by Gah Lak Tus. Gah Lak Tus is an immense (approx. 100,000 miles long) group mind of city-sized robotic drones, and attacks worlds with envoys (resembling the [[Silver Surfer]]) and then a flesh-eating virus which destroys all life. After this the entity breaks open the dying world and sucks all thermal energy from the core. Gah Lak Tus considers all forms and expressions of organic life to be so abhorrent it believed itself desecrated when telepathically contacted by [[Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Professor X]].<ref>''Ultimate Nightmare'' (2004); ''Ultimate Secret'' (2005) & ''Ultimate Extinction'' (2006)</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===

Galactus appears in the pocket universe created by Franklin Richards - after the events of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] saga - and deploys several heralds at once and actually succeeds in consuming the Earth twice, although this is undone by [[Doctor Doom]] with use of his time machine. <ref>''Heroes Reborn'' (1996 - 1997)</ref>

===Mangaverse===

Like his Ultimate counter-part, the [[Marvel Mangaverse|Mangaverse]] incarnation of Galactus is also wildly different from the original. Manga Galactus appears as a gigantic, planet-sized lifeform (similar to [[Ego the Living Planet]] ) and once fed upon the planet Earth millions of years ago, causing the extinction of the dinosaurs. 

===Marvel Zombies===

Galactus appears in his "classic" form and battles the ''[[Marvel Zombies]].'' A weakened Galactus threatens the group, but is overwhelmed and eaten.  <ref>''Marvel Zombies'' (2005 - 2006)</ref>

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Silver Surfur ep1to3.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Image of Galactus from 1998 Silver Surfer animated series.]]

*Galactus appeared in the 1967 version of ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|The Fantastic Four]]''.

*Galactus appeared in the 1994 version of ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|The Fantastic Four]]'' with Silver Surfer. Many other Marvel heroes make an appearance, and Galactus is defeated by [[Ghost Rider]]'s penance stare. He was voiced by the late [[Tony Jay]].

*Galactus also regularly appeared as a ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' cartoon series on [[Fox Kids|FOX Kids]] Network in 1998, being one of the only characters on the show to be CGI-based. He is voiced by [[James Blendick]].

===Video games===
*Galactus appears as a boss in the videogame ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.

===Movies===
*Galactus will appear in the upcoming movie ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' which is due to be released in 2007.

==Influence==
[[Image:CanMonsterMovieAlbumCover.jpg|thumb|Cover of Can's ''[[Monster Movie]]'' album]]
A faceless Galactus was featured on the cover of 1969's ''[[Monster Movie]]'', [[Can (band)|Can's]] debut album.

[[The Tick]] animated series had an episode ("Alone Together") featuring a character named "[[Omnipotus]]" which was an obvious parody of Galactus, down to the eating of worlds, although much less intelligent and having really small feet. After being shot into space, the Tick briefly becomes the herald of Omnipotus, analoguous to [[The Silver Surfer]], rebelling and later convincing Omnipotus to spare Earth (although he did take a bite out of the moon to tide him over until he could find another world). He also appeared with the Tick's comic-book incarnation.

[[The Savage Dragon]] comic-book series by [[Erik Larsen]] featured a massive extraterrestrial villain named Universo, drawn in the distinctive Kirby style, who proceeds to eat the planet Earth. The character even had a herald, the controversial Mother Mayhem. Since the Savage Dragon makes use of multiple realities, it is explained that Dragon's original world is destroyed while he is in the one he currently resides in.

The [[Transformers (toyline)|Transformers]] character [[Unicron]] plays a very similar role in the series' comic book mythos, even to the point of parodying his origins and featuring heralds such as [[Galvatron#Generation 1|Galvatron]]. However, unlike Galactus, Unicron is thoroughly evil, and is more or less considered to be the Transformers' equivalent to the [[devil]] (with his counterpart, [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], being the equivalent of [[God]]). The cartoon continuity of the series (including the feature-length [[Transformers: The Movie|movie]]) created a completely different origin, far removed from the Galactus overtones, though the character still had many Galactus-like traits. In fact, Unicron's first appearance in the Transformers mythology ([[The Transformers: The Movie]]) bears many similarities to Galactus' first appearance in the Fantastic Four comics. Whether or not this was intentional or coincidental remains unknown.

The syndicated comic ''[[Brewster Rockit: Space Guy!]]'' had a storyline featuring a giant humanoid alien named Cosmicus who is attempting to devour the Earth.

The [[Darkstalkers]] character [[Pyron]] the eater of worlds has the same physical build as Galactus as well as having thin horns on the side of his head. Pyron is made of solar plasma, which can be considered like Galactus since he turns into a star without his armor. In the games Pyron is the last boss and here as well as the Anime, Manga, and Udon comic books is depicted as a planet eater. The only exception to this is the American made cartoon series where Pyron is the collector of worlds and lacks most of his video game powers

==Parodies==
===Parodies in Marvel Comics===
* In a comedic issue of Marvel's [[What If (comics)|''What If?'']] series, Galactus was banished to earth and lands outside a trailer park, suffering from amnesia. After he is discovered by a local, she declares that he looks exactly like a young Elvis Presley. Galactus/Elvis begins a music career but when he is finally confronted by a galactic being and given his memory back, he chooses to remain on Earth as the king of Rock N' Roll.

* In another ''What If?'' short, Galactus is depicted as the nephew of Ben and May Parker (instead of Peter Parker), who casually resurrects Uncle Ben after he is shot and turns the murderer into a puddle of protoplasm.

* In a "What The!? Comics Presents" story (Written by Scott Lobdell), Galactus has been forced to go on a diet and runs a casually murderous hotel that has various super heroes as both guests and staff. Hijinx ensues as Galactus finds the hotel inspector killed twice while under cover.

===Parodies in Other Comics===
* In the [[NOW Comics]] series [[Married With Children]]: Quantum Quartet, a [[Fantastic Four]] parody, the family is forced to fight "Gastritus, Chomper of Planets."  His helmet is alternately drawn as, amongst other items, a coffee-perculator, a garbage bin, and a poker machine.  His herald was The Golden Beach Bum, and he was defeated when the new Bundy, Little 4.5 revealed his power - the power to annoy, very loudly - and shattered Gastritus' teeth.

* See also [[Mister Nebula]], a [[DC Comics]] villain who clashed with the [[Justice League]] and was a parody of Galactus.

* Archie Comic's [[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie comic)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] series briefly mentions a Galactus look-alike twice, first in one of their alternate-universe storylines (which, itself, is reminiscent of the [[What If (comics)|''What If?'']] series). Robolactus looks exactly like classic Galactus except that his face resembles [[Dr. Robotnik#SatAM|Dr. Robotnik]]. Robolactus also has a herald character known as "Silver Snivley", after [[Snively Kintobor]]. The second is in a story made up by [[Miles "Tails" Prower]] in issue #38 featuring Sonic, [[Sally Acorn]], [[Rotor Walrus]], and Tails as a group of [[Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four-esque]] superheroes who face off against a Galactus-like enemy, this one too bearing similarity to Robotnik, though with the name "Robotnicus" and operating on his own.

* In [[New England Comics|New England Comics']] [[The Tick]] comics, in the Karma Tornado series (as well as in the episode "Alone Together" in the Tick animated series), the Tick encounters a being known as Nigh-Omnipotous. Omnipotous recruits the Tick as his "herald" (after his previous assistant Ham, a superintelligent NASA space chimp, quit after 30 years) giving the hero one of his giant sandals to transport the Tick around the universe looking for planets. When the Tick encountered one with a civilization going through its [[Bronze Age]], Omnipotous would send the Tick somewhere else while he consumed the planet. One day, the Tick returned early to find Omnipotous mid-meal, and scolded the giant. Omnipotous, guilt-stricken, deposited the Tick on a nearby planet and self-destructed. He left the Tick a note saying "Dear Tick, I know you can't forgive me for what I've done. Goodbye." In the cartoon, after coming to Earth to eat it (the Bronze Age dietary requirement apparently forgotten) the Tick and Arthur help Omnipotous realize how evil he's been in devouring planets. He takes a bite out of the moon for a snack, and goes out into the universe, presumably changing his ways.

===Parodies in Other Media===
* In the episode of "Fairly Oddparents" on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], called "Mighty Mom and Dyno Dad", [[Timmy Turner]] wishes himself to be a great superbeing called Galactimus, the eater of planets, so he can make his parents vulnerable to magic. Cosmo and Wanda then turn themselves into silver beings who ride on skateboards, in a parody of the Silver Surfer.

* The [[Dexter's Laboratory]] backup series ''Dial M for Monkey'' once included a battle between the heroes of Earth and '''Barbequor''', a cosmic entity who eats worlds with barbeque sauce, and who had a herald called the 'Silver Spooner'. This episode was banned due to the Silver Spooner parody.

* In the 1997 [[Fox Kids|FOX Kids]] cartoon "Sam and Max: Freelance Police"; the character of Galactus was also spoofed in the form of the character 'Lactose the Intolerant'.

* An episode of ''Duck Dodgers'' contained a parody of Galactus.  In the episode "Consumption Overruled" features a planet-eating being named Hungortus who eats planets with a mouth on his stomach and whose shape and armor resembles Galactus.

* In an episode of the Adult Swim show ''[[Minoriteam]]'', a character named Balactus (voiced by [[Michael Clark Duncan]]), intends to destroy the whole world. The color scheme, appearance, and actions of the character are highly similar to those of Galactus. A notable difference in the appearance is that Balactus is black (as the name suggests), and has an afro.

* In ''[[The Jimmy/Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators]]'', the appearance of Shirley the Android aka The Villain Whose Name Isn't Shirley is related to the look of Galactus.

* In the Fairly Odd Parents Movie the character Mr. Crocker transforms into a super villain that appears to be a cross between Galactus and Apocalypse and sporting Archangel's wings.

* In the Adult Swim show [[Venture Bros.]] episode titled Twenty Years to Midnight the characters encounter a character named The Grand Galactic Inquisitor who was going to judge and destroy their planet. He looked like a cross between Galactus, a Celestial, and DC's Mr. Nebula (albeit on a much smaller scale - only about 12 feet tall).

* On the cartoon Network show ''[[Ben 10]]'' in the episode titled "Big Tick" they go up against a giant tick alien that burrows tendrils into planets and consumes them this way (similar to the Marvel Mangaverse version of Galactus). While not being the same shape as Galactus the creature's original color scheme before shedding was the same as the original Galactus.

==Appearances in Pop Culture==
* On an episode of [[The Daily Show]], in reference to [[Pluto]] being downgraded from a planet, "resident expert" [[John Hodgman]] suggested the criterion "Would Galactus eat it for food?" as a way to determine if a celestial object was a planet or not.

*In the final episode of [[Justice League Unlimited]], "Destroyer", Galactus is one of the beings that is imprisoned on the [[Source Wall]].
