'''Galactus''', sometimes called the '''Devourer of Worlds''' or '''Eater of Planets''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character, a cosmic entity within [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Created by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48, the beginning of a [[story arc]] sometimes regarded as the finest Lee/Kirby collaboration.

When Galactus threatened to destroy the [[Earth]], the [[Fantastic Four]] (aided by Galactus' erstwhile herald, the [[Silver Surfer]]) defeated him and Galactus vowed to never again try and harm the Earth. 

==About Galactus==

Originally named '''Galen''', he is the sole survivor of the [[Big Crunch]] of the previous [[universe]]. A [[outer space|space]] explorer investigating the impending end of his universe, he approached the focal point of the Big Crunch and was transformed into a cosmic entity even as the universe collapsed. After the [[Big Bang]] of the current universe, to complete his [[metamorphosis (biology)|transformation]], Galactus was encased in a [[cosmic egg]] brimming with enormous energies. After billions of years, he emerged as an entity of vast cosmic power who was also necessary for the existence of the newly formed universe.  Galactus is considered one of the three essential entities within the Marvel Universe alongside [[Eternity (Marvel character)|Eternity]], the anthropomorphic personification of the universe, and [[Death (Marvel character)|Death]].

Though he wields the immeasurable '''Power Cosmic''', Galactus must feed off the energy of [[planet]]s, without which he cannot survive. Towards this end, Galactus scours the universe seeking planets to sustain himself. Over millions of years he has become one of the most feared beings in the universe, his vast power allowing him to lay waste to innumerable [[extra-terrestrial]] [[civilization]]s in his quest for sustenance. Nevertheless, he is not [[evil]], but rather a [[force of nature]].

He has appointed a number of entities as his [[Galactus's Heralds|heralds]], imbuing them with a portion of the Power Cosmic and sending them to search for edible worlds. Most of his heralds have rebelled or betrayed him.  Among his heralds are the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Terrax]], [[Firelord]], [[Air-Walker]], [[Nova (comics)|Nova]], [[Morg]], and [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]].

Galactus is the focus of ''[[Marvels]]'' #3.

Recently, in the ''Galactus: The Devourer'' limited series ([[1999]]-[[2000]]), Galactus died and was changed into a [[star]] by the forces of the Earth heroes and the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. Galactus has since returned to the normal continuity in various appearances in the pages of ''Fantastic Four'' and in a new ''[[Thanos]]'' series that began in [[2003]].

Galactus also made an appearance in the [[Earth X]] series, which lies outside the normal Marvel [[Earth 616]] [[continuity]]. The Earth X series revealed why Galactus was one of the three essential entities in the Marvel Universe: by declaring that by destroying planets, which were really "eggs" of the [[Celestials]], he prevented the Celestials from overpopulating the universe. However, other revelations in the Earth X series have proven to be false in regards to normal Marvel continuity, so this aspect of Galactus' nature may only be true in Earth X.

==Quotations==
*"Of all the creatures in the vastness of the universe, there is none like me. I was present at the birth of the universe, and I shall be there at its end. Though I ravage worlds to live, I bear no malice to any living thing. I simply do what I must to survive. And why must Galactus survive? For, no matter how many worlds I devour... How many civilizations I destroy... It is my destiny to one day give back to the universe -- infinitely more than I have ever taken from it. So speaks Galactus."
:--Galactus, ''The Origin of Galactus'' ([[Marvel Comic]], [[1996]])
