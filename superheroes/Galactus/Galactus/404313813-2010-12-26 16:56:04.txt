==Publication history==
===Origin===
{{Main|The Galactus Trilogy}}
In 1966, nearly five years after having launched [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break from the archetypal mold of [[supervillain]]s of the time, and be instead a being of god-like stature and power.<ref name=kirbycollector1>Hatfield, Charles. "The Galactus Trilogy: An Appreciation", ''The Collected Jack Kirby Collector'', February 2004, p. 211</ref> As Lee recalled in 1993,
{{bquote|Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. having dreamed up [many] powerful baddies ... we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of of demi-god, but now what would we do with him. We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. ...  That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god would be beyond mere good and evil. ... [What] he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!"<ref>Lee, Stan. "Introduction" (second page, unnumbered) 1993, ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 5''<!--as spelled in copyright indicia--> (Marvel Publishing : second edition, second printing, 2007) ISBN 978-0-7851-1184-9</ref>}}
<!--Wiki MOS is to use blockquotes for quotes four lines or longer-->
Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee dubbed the [[Silver Surfer]]:
{{bquote|My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales. And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. ...I had to get something new. And ... for some reason, I went to the Bible. And I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well, because I always felt him, and I certainly couldn't treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal ... and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel. ...[T]hey were figures that have never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures, and of course, they were the first gods.<ref>{{cite video

Kirby further explained, "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way."<ref>Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert.

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation, stating, "In five short years from the launch of the ''Fantastic Four'', the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the [[Skrull]]s, the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

All this led to the introduction of Galactus in ''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling "The Galactus Trilogy".<ref>{{Citation |last=Fein |first=Eric |title=The Creation of the Fantastic Four |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |pages=48}}</ref><ref>[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]].

Subsequently, Galactus relegates the Surfer to earth by erecting an impenetrable barrier, leading to several guest appearances by the Silver Surfer in ''Fantastic Four''. This signaled the departure of Galactus from the story following the trilogy, as Kirby had not intended for Galactus to reappear in order to preserve the character's tremendous presence.<ref name=kirbycollector2>{{Cite journal

[[File:FantasticFour49.jpg|thumb|right|''Fantastic Four'' #49 (April 1966), featuring Galactus. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Joe Sinnott]].]]

===1960s===
Galactus returned for a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #134 (Nov. 1966), although the plot-line was left unresolved as Kirby put the character on hiatus.<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> Galactus reappeared in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] cameo in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #37 (Feb. 1968) and then featured heavily in ''Fantastic Four'' #72-77 (March - Aug. 1968) at the request of Lee.<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> After a flashback appearance in ''Silver Surfer'' #1 (Aug. 1968), the character returned to Earth in ''Thor'' #160-162 (Jan.- March 1969), which resolved the plot-line from issue #134, and issue #162 began the transition to Galactus' origin story, but the character made an unexplained departure from the storyline. Galactus' origin was finally revealed in ''Thor '' #168-169 (Sept.-Oct. 1969).

===1970s & 1980s===
The character made appearances in ''Fantastic Four'' #120-123 (March–June 1972) and ''Thor'' #225-228 (July-Oct. 1974) - the storylines introduced two new [[Herald of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]] - and ''Fantastic Four'' #172-175 (July-Oct. 1976) and #206-213 (May-Dec. 1979).

Writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], and inkers [[Jack Abel]] and [[Vince Colletta]] collaborated to produce an in-depth, 23-page origin story titled "Galactus", which appeared in ''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983). While mostly identical to the previous origin, the story featured additions, edits, and deletions, and was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (Feb. 1996). Certain details regarding the character's transformation into Galactus are altered. Most specifically, rather than journeying into a dying star, the character enters [[Cosmic egg|the core of the collapsing universe]] prior to the "[[Big Bang]]".

The character guest-starred in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #26-27 (Jan.-Feb. 1982), being one of many Marvel characters that appeared to help bring credibility to the [[Parker Brothers]]-owned toy turned superhero. Galactus featured heavily in two related storylines in ''Fantastic Four'' #242-244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (Aug. 1983), which showcased the arrival of another Herald and examined Galactus' relationship with the other members of the cosmic hierarchy. The consequences of the storyline in ''Fantastic Four'' #242-244 (May–July 1982) were examined in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #262 (Jan. 1984) which attracted controversy. During the conclusion of the story, the character [[Eternity (Marvel Comics)|Eternity]], the living sentience of the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus, which [[Howard University]] Professor of Literature Marc Singer criticized, stating writer-artist [[John Byrne]] used the character as a means to "justify planetary-scale genocide."<ref>Singer, Marc.

[http://www.webcitation.org/5v9XIKXrX WebCitation archive].</ref>

Writer-penciler [[John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced "The Last Galactus Story" as a serial in the [[anthology]] comics-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26-34 (Oct. 1984 - Feb. 1986). Nine of a scheduled 10 installments appeared. Each ran six pages, except part eight, which ran 12. The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished. Byrne later revealed on his website that the conclusion would have seen a dying Galactus releasing his power, causing a new [[big bang]] and transforming his herald [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]] into the Galactus of the next universe.<ref name="byrnerobotics.com">[[John Byrne|Byrne, John]], [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 "Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'"], "Frequently Asked Questions - Questions about Aborted Storylines", Byrne Robotics, February 15, 2005.

[[File:Galan-galactus.jpg|thumb|right|Galan of Taa and the Sentience of the [previous] Universe in the [[Cosmic egg]]]]
Galactus played a pivotal role in the [[limited series]] ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1-12 (May 1984 - April 1985), and became a recurring character in the third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'', commencing with issue #1 (July 1987).

===1990s===
Galactus featured prominently in the limited series ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991) and ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1992). Storylines in ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #81-82 (June–July 1993) and the limited series ''Cosmic Powers'' #1 - 6 (March - Aug. 1994) also revealed Galactus once experimented and created the entity [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]], who briefly returned and opposed his former master.

The character starred in the six-issue ''Galactus the Devourer'' (Sept. 1999 - March 2000), written by Louise Simonson and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus' death. Simonson had originally conceived of the [[story arc]] to take place in third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'', but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. Simonson instead proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she believed to be a "radical" idea concerning "why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus."<ref>[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html "Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning..."], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d. Retrieved 2008-04-14. [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9bxLffx WebCitation archive].</ref>

===2000s===
The consequences of Galactus' death are explored in ''Fantastic Four'' Annual 2001 and ''Fantastic Four'' #46-49 (Oct. 2001 - Jan. 2002), as it is revealed that his energies kept a greater [[Abraxas (comics)|universal threat]] in check, and he is revived by [[Franklin Richards|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards]].

Galactus features prominently in the first six issues of the series ''[[Thanos]]'' (Dec. 2003 - May 2004), written by [[Jim Starlin]]. The story is noteworthy due to a running theme of highly critical evaluation of the [[Social Darwinism|standard]] [[Divine right of kings|justifications]] for the character. The story reveals that Galactus never sleeps due to an aching conscience, and centers on his quest to find permanent non-sentient sources of energy, as he attempts to reassemble the [[Infinity Gems]] for this purpose. However, the even greater predator ''Hunger'' hijacks the attempt. At the end Thanos engages in a verbal exchange with Galactus, with the former stating that actively searching for non-harmfull alternate ways to feed his appetite was "the right thing to do", and defends the need for a "[[social contract]]" with the rest of the universe. Issues #7-12, written by Keith Giffen also retroactively introduce the first herald, the Fallen One.

After appearing in the limited series ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2005), Galactus was featured as a central character in the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" storyline, appearing in the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' #1-4 (June-Sept. 2006), ''Annihilation'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007), and the [[epilogue]], ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus]]'' #1-2 (Feb.–April 2007). The second issue of the epilogue established that Galactus had quelled a rebellion among the "Proemial Gods", former caretakers of the early universe who wished to restructure it in their image. Additionally, in a separate story within the same book, a former herald of Galactus, [[Firelord]], stated that Galactus' "serves cosmic consonance".

Galactus' origin is re-examined in ''Fantastic Four'' #520-523 (Jan.-April 2005), as the character is temporarily reverted to the mortal Galan; [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] appeals to Galan's humanity and convinces him to evade the "Galactus essence", but the plan ultimately fails, and Galan is reconstituted as Galactus once more.

During a guest appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #545-546 (June–July 2007), Galactus seeks to devour the fellow cosmic function [[Eon (comics)|Epoch]], and was opposed by the quartet along with the entity's then appointed "protector of the Universe" [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]. Following this, the character's feeding on a planet served as a backdrop in ''[[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'' vol. 4, #13-15 (May–July 2008), an appearance in which Galactus had no dialogue across all three issues, with the Silver Surfer instead acting as his mouthpiece. Writer [[Andy Lanning]] stated that he and co-writer [[Dan Abnett]] were "treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping."<ref>Rogers,Vaneta. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=153225 "Galactus, and Surfer and Skrulls - Oh My! Abnett & Lanning on Nova"], ''[[Newsarama]]'', April 10, 2008 [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9cJPcN1 WebCitation archive].</ref>

The character also appeared in the limited series ''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1-3 (June 2009 - Aug. 2009), a sequel to ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' # 1-6 (March-Aug. 2005).

Galactus and the Silver Surfer would also appear as antagonists in [[Skaar]]: Son of Hulk,<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #9-11</ref> and later as protagonists in the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' (June-Nov. 2010) as well as featuring as members of the "[[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]]" within the [[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]] event miniseries.<ref>''Chaos War'' #2-5 (Dec.-March 2010)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{In-universe|date=April 2010}}

Galactus was originally an explorer called Galan from a planet called "Taa" in a universe which existed before the [[Big Bang]]. When the impending cataclysm gradually killed all life in his universe, including almost all of his own people, he and other survivors sought to escape the decay of their world. They left Taa via a space vessel, but it was eventually engulfed in the cataclysm that ended the old universe and spawned a new one. Galan, however, did not die, but was transformed through a bonding with the Sentience of the Universe, and [[gestate]]d for billions of years, emerging - partially due to the inactivity of a [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] - into the new universe as Galactus.<ref>''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983)</ref>

In modern Earth times, the [[cosmic entity]] [[Uatu]] the Watcher, having met and established a relationship with [[superhero]] team the [[Fantastic Four]], warns leader [[Mister Fantastic]] of the coming of Galactus, who must consume the energies of entire worlds to survive. Uatu tries to hide Earth from the [[Herald of Galactus]], the [[Silver Surfer]], by placing a huge [[asteroid belt]] around the planet, but the ruse fails. The Surfer arrives on the top of the Fantastic Four's headquarters, the [[Baxter Building]], and alerts Galactus.

The Fantastic Four battle the Surfer until  the arrival of Galactus, who ignores the pleas of the Watcher and the combined attacks of the Fantastic Four members the [[Johnny Storm|Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and begins to assemble a device to facilitate in the consumption of Earth's energies. Galactus is aided by his [[cyborg]] servant, the [[Punisher (Galactus)|Punisher]]. The Watcher, however, sends the Torch to Galactus' ship to retrieve the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], the one weapon that can destroy Galactus. When confronted by Mister Fantastic - wielding the Nullifier - and a rebellious Silver Surfer, who has been touched by the humanity of [[Alicia Masters]] (the Thing's girlfriend), Galactus retreats. The entity retrieves the Nullifier and banishes the Surfer to Earth, stating he may never leave.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (March–May 1966)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-50/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 50 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}.

Galactus eventually returned seeking his former Herald, who had taken refuge in a [[microscopic]] universe. Mister Fantastic, the Torch and the Thing pursue the Surfer, and after several encounters with the villain [[Psycho-Man]], ensure the Surfer makes contact with his former master. The Surfer, however, is unrepentant and chooses to remain on Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #72-77 (March-Aug. 1968)</ref> The Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] encounters Galactus when the entity comes into conflict with [[Ego the Living Planet]];<ref>''Thor'' #160-162 (Jan.-March 1969)</ref> and eventually discovers Galactus' origin.

Galactus reappears when the entity sends the [[Air-Walker]] (eventually revealed to be an [[Android (robot)|android]] copy of the original<ref>''Thor'' #306 (April 1981)</ref>) to Earth to re-enlist the Silver Surfer as his Herald. The Fantastic Four and the Surfer defeat the Air-Walker, but to appease Galactus, Mr. Fantastic reprograms the entity's ship to journey to the [[Negative Zone]], where there will apparently be abundance of uninhabited worlds to consume.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #120-123 (March–June 1972)</ref> Thor and [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]] ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] encounter Galactus when his third Herald, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]], travels to Earth seeking to be free of his master. The Herald is freed when Thor presents Galactus with the armor of the [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] to animate and use as a Herald.<ref>''Thor'' #225-226 (July-Aug. 1974)</ref>

The character returns to battle the [[High Evolutionary]] over Earth's twin, [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] with the encounter ending with Galactus being transformed into harmless energy after attempting to devour the planet [[Poppup]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #172-175 (July-Oct. 1976)</ref> Galactus eventually reintegrates into his normal form, and is sought out by the Fantastic Four, who seek a way to stop a new cosmic threat, the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]]. Mister Fantastic states that if Galactus will stop the Sphinx, he is free to attempt to attack Earth once again. Galactus agrees, but under the condition the Fantastic Four first help find and humble a fourth Herald. The heroes are successful, and the newly empowered [[Terrax]] leads his new master to Earth. Galactus locates the Sphinx in [[Egypt]] and defeats the villain, then decides to retreat when Mister Fantastic threatens to use a [[fake|faux]] Ultimate Nullifier, apparently built with the aid of the Watcher from technology on Galactus' ship.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206-213 (May-Dec. 1979)</ref>

Galactus is tricked by the [[Galadorian]] spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] into attempting to devour the "Black Nebula", the home of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Dire Wraiths]], but is repelled by the magic "Wraith Sun";<ref>''Rom'' #26-27 (Jan.-Feb. 1984)</ref> and although weakened, pursues a rebellious Terrax to Earth and strips his Herald of all power. Drained of energy, Galactus is saved by the combined efforts of the Fantastic Four and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and acquires a new Herald, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #242-244 (May–July 1982)</ref> Galactus also destroys the [[Skrull]] homeworld and discusses with fellow cosmic entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] his role in the universe.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #257 (Aug. 1983)</ref> When Mister Fantastic is captured and placed on trial by a united group of alien races, all of whom have been annihilated as a result of Galactus' hunger, the entity Eternity intervenes. Eternity allows all present to momentarily become one with the universe, thereby allowing them to understand that Galactus is a vital part of cosmic order, despite the continued loss of entire races.<ref name="ff262"/>

Galactus becomes integral to the plans of the villain [[Annihilus]], who instigates a war against the universe. Annihilus' initial attack, a devastating assault called the [[Annihilation Wave]], destroys the Kyln and frees the ancient beings [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]] and Tenebrous. The pair - together with fellow inmate Antiphon - are revealed to be "Proemial Gods" that existed at the dawn of the universe.  After a faction of the Gods led by Diableri of Chaos attempted to remake the universe in their image, [[civil war]] ensued. Galactus became involved in the struggle, slew Diableri, and imprisoned the remaining two rebel Gods in the Kyln, along with the neutral ''Antiphon the Overseer''. Intent on vengeance, Aegis and Tenebrous find and defeat the Silver Surfer and Galactus, delivering them to Annihilus.

After destroying the Air-Walker robot and killing Morg, Annihilus and Thanos bind Galactus, intent on using the entity's energies to destroy the universe. Galactus, however, is freed by [[Drax the Destroyer]], and after teleporting Drax to safety, unleashes a blast that destroys more than three [[star system]]s and the majority of Annihilus' forces. The Surfer draws Aegis and Tenebrous into the barrier between the universe and the [[Negative Zone]], which destroys them.<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1 - 4 (June - Sep. 2006); ''Annihilation'' #1 - 6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007); ''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #1 - 2 (April - May 2007)</ref>

Galactus and his herald Stardust once again come into conflict with Beta Ray Bill when Bill seeks vengeance against Galactus for consuming the second homeworld of his species, the Korbinites.<ref>''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1 - 3 (June 2009 - Aug. 2009)</ref>

Galactus was created by the union between the "Sentience of the [previous] Universe" and Galan,<ref name="svc">''Super-Villain Classics'' #1 (May 1983)</ref> and was described by the Human Torch (as a [[Human_Torch#Getting_a_real_job|temporary herald]], he possessed a heightened perception of reality) as "the physical, metamorphosed embodiment of a [[cosmos]]."<ref name="fantastic522">''Fantastic Four'' #522 (March 2005)</ref> Galactus considers himself a higher being than all non-abstracts, maintaining his existence by devouring planets that have the potential for supporting life. This has resulted in the elimination of entire [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] civilizations on numerous worlds.<ref>''Thanos'' #6 (May 2004)</ref>

Galactus wields the [[Power Cosmic]] and can employ it to produce nearly any effect he desires, including the molecular restructuring and [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of matter,<ref name="Silver Surfer #1 Aug. 1968">''Silver Surfer'' #1 (Aug. 1968)</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #211 (Oct. 1979)</ref><ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #70 (Aug. 1992)</ref> the [[teleportation]] of objects &mdash; even an entire galaxy<ref name="rom" /> &mdash; across [[space]] <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #257 (Aug. 1981)</ref> or [[time]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #213 (December 1979)</ref> size-alteration,<ref name="rom">''Rom'' #27 (Feb. 1982)</ref> the projection of energy with indeterminable destructive force,<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (March 2007)</ref> the erection of nearly impenetrable [[force field (science fiction)|force fields]],<ref name="Silver Surfer #1 Aug. 1968"/> the creation of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|interdimensional]]<ref>''Thanos'' #3 (Feb. 2004)</ref> and intra-dimensional [[Portal (fiction)|portals]],<ref>''Thanos'' #12 (Sept. 2004)</ref> [[telepathy]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #242 (May 1982)</ref> [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #49 (April 1966)</ref> [[pyrokinesis]],<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #13 (July 2008)</ref> and a form of [[List of comic book superpowers#Cross-dimensional awareness|cosmic awareness]].<ref name="secretwars9">''Secret Wars'' #9 (Jan. 1985)</ref>

Due to this inherent hunger, Earth's heroes have been able to achieve various degrees of success in repelling, or defeating, a starving, weakened Galactus. At this diminished state Galactus has shown susceptibility to the ''Images of [[Ikonn]]'' spell, which forces him to recall all of the beings he has destroyed as a result of his feeding.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #243 (June 1982)</ref>  Galactus also wears armor to help regulate his internal energies.

The oldest living entity in the universe and, in fact, the first,<ref name="Godhunter3"/> Galactus employs advanced science capable of creating the [[Ultimate Nullifier]]<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (March–May 1966),</ref> and the immense ship Taa II.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #210 (Sept. 1979)</ref> Reed Richards speculated that Taa II — the [[Möbius strip]]-shaped, solar system-sized home of Galactus — could be the greatest source of energy in the universe.<ref name="secretwars9"/>

Galactus has appointed a number of beings to act as his [[Herald of Galactus|Herald]], with each bestowed with a small fraction of the [[Power Cosmic]].
