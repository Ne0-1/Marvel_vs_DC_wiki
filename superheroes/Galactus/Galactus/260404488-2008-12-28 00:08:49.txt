==Publication history==
==="The Galactus Trilogy"===
{{main|The Galactus Trilogy}}
In 1966, nearly five years after having launched [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break from the archetypal mold of [[supervillain]]s of the time, and be instead a being of god-like stature and power.<ref name="kirbycollector1"/> As Lee later explained, "I created Galactus after we had done so many villains and wanted something different. I wondered, 'How could we get something bigger than a villain? Let's do a guy who's like a demigod â€” I like the name Galactus'. He comes from outer space and eats planets, or some stupid thing".This culminated in the introduction of Galactus in ''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (March-May 1966), now known as "''The Galactus Trilogy''".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fein|first=Eric|title=The Creation of the Fantastic Four|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2006|pages=48}}</ref>

Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee dubbed the [[Silver Surfer]]:
{{cquote|My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales. And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. In other words I couldn't depend on gangsters anymore, I had to get something new. And ... for some reason, I went to the Bible. And I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well, because I always felt him, and I certainly couldn't treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal ... and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel. ...[T]hey were figures that have never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures, and of course, they were the first gods.<ref>{{cite video

Kirby further explained that "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way."<ref>{{Citation

The trilogy culminated in ''Fantastic Four'' #50 ( May 1966), which featured the Silver Surfer interceding for humankind against Galactus. After the trilogy, Kirby had not intended for Galactus to reappear, in order to preserve the character's tremendous presence.<ref name=kirbycollector2>{{Citation

  }}</ref> Popularity among fans, however, prompted Lee to petition Kirby for Galactus' reappearance,<ref name=kirbycollector2 /> and the character eventually became a mainstay in the Marvel Universe.

Galactus returned for a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #134 (Nov. 1966), which hinted at a confrontation between Galactus and another Lee and Kirby character, [[Ego the Living Planet]]. The plot-line was left unresolved in the subsequent issues, as Kirby put the character on hiatus.<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> Galactus reappeared more than a year later, in a [[flashback]] cameo in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #37 (Feb. 1968) before starring opposite the Fantastic Four in ''Fantastic Four'' #72-77 (March-Aug. 1968) at the request of Lee,<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> and then in flashback in ''The Silver Surfer'' #1 (Aug. 1968). He eventually returns to Earth, however, seeking the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #74 - 77 (May - Aug. 1968)</ref> 

Lee and Kirby then featured Galactus in a storyline in ''Thor'' #160-162 (Jan.-March 1969), which resolved the plot-line from issue #134. Issue #162 began the transition to [[#Rebirth|Galactus' origin story]], but the character makes an unexplained departure from the storyline. The absence of the character may be explained by miscommunication between Kirby and Lee; Kirby may have wanted to directly write Galactus' origin, while Lee may have had his own interpretation of the character's beginnings.<ref>{{Citation

===1970s and 1980s===
Two appearances showcasing new [[Herald of Galactus|heralds]] followed in ''Fantastic Four'' #120-123 (March-June 1972) and ''Thor'' #225-228 (July-Oct. 1974), and subsequently appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #172-175 (July-Oct. 1976) and #206-213 (May-Dec. 1979).

[[Image:Galan-galactus.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Sentience of the [previous] Universe'' merges with Galan of Taa in the [[Cosmic egg]].]]
In 1983, writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], and inkers [[Jack Abel]] and [[Vince Colletta]] collaborated to produce a more in-depth, 23-page origin story titled "''Galactus''", which appeared in ''Super-Villain Classics'' #1 (May). The story featured additions, edits, and deletions, and was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (Feb. 1996). This story redefined Galactus' origin as being Galan, the last survivor of the previous cosmos who at the end of the universe, enters a cosmic egg. Within the Cosmic egg, the Sentience of the Universe reveals itself to Galan and informs him that though they both will die in the impending cataclysm, they will survive through a joint heir born into the next universe. The Sentience of the Universe then merges itself with the mortal Galan, establishing Galan as the sole survivor of the ensuing Big Crunch. After the Big Bang and the birth of the present reality, Galactus gestates in a cocoon of cosmic energy in order to complete his [[metamorphosis]], and after an undetermined period of time emerges as an entity of vast cosmic power who is essential and intrinsic to the newly formed universe. This version added additional information to the origin present in Thor #168 included Galactus constructing Taa II, in homage to his dead homeworld Taa out of the remains of Archeopia.<ref name="svc">''Super-Villain Classics'' #1 (May 1983)</ref>

The character returned in ''Fantastic Four'' #242-244 (May-July 1982)<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #242 - 244 (May - July 1982)</ref> and then ''Fantastic Four'' #257 (Aug. 1983), where his relationship with other cosmic entities was developed further. The entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] notes that Galactus is "my husband and father, my brother and son." <ref name="fantastic257">''Fantastic Four'' #257 (Aug. 1983)</ref> This is followed by a [[cameo appearance]] in ''Fantastic Four'' #262 (Jan. 1984) and the appearance of the entity [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] (Galactus refers to Eternity as 'Father') who asserts that Galactus is essential to the balance part of the natural order of the cosmos. <ref name="ff262">''Fantastic Four'' #262 (Jan. 1984)</ref> The necessity of Galactus and his role in the universe is developed over the next two decades and his representation as 'the type of evil that we can celebrate as a catalyst for the long-term good of all creation'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zimmerman|first=David A.|title=Comic Book Character: Unleashing The Hero In Us All|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2004|pages=160}}</ref> 

The same year, the [[anthology]] comics-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26-34 (Oct. 1984 - Feb. 1986) published the first nine serialized installments of a projected 10-part tale, "''The Last Galactus Story''", by writer-penciler [[John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]]. Each ran six pages, with the exception of part eight, which ran 12 pages. The magazine was cancelled at this point, leaving the story unfinished. According to notes at Byrne's website, the conclusion of the story would see a dying Galactus releasing his power causing a new [[big bang]] and transforming his herald [[Nova]] into the Galactus for the new universe.<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57  Byrne Robotics: Frequently Asked Questions - Questions about Aborted Storylines]</ref>

The following year, Galactus would place an important appearance in the limited series ''[[Secret Wars|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' (May 1984 - April 1985), and then again in ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 (1987 - 1998). The concept of the need for Galactus was revisited, as the [[Living Tribunal]] likens Galactus to one of the three essential forces  - Equity (Galactus); Necessity (Eternity) and Vengeance (Death).  <ref name="silversurfer31">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989)</ref> 

=== 1990s ===
Galactus featured prominently in the ''Infinity'' series of the 1990s, specifically ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991) and ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1992), and starred in the six-issue [[limited series|miniseries]] ''Galactus the Devourer'' (Sept. 1999 - March 2000), written by Louise Simonson and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with the character's death. Simonson had originally conceived of the [[story arc]] to take place in third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'', but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. Simonson instead proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she believed to be a "radical" idea concerning "''why the very existence of the Universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus.''"<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-04-14 }}</ref> The series concludes with the death of Galactus at the hands of the Silver Surfer. As Galactus' body disperses, he warns that his death will allow a great evil to surface.

=== 2000s ===
After his death, Galactus' remains take the form of a [[star]].<ref>''Galactus the Devourer'' #1-6 (Sept. 1999 - March 2000)</ref> When the Fantastic Four later learn that the energy Galactus harvests from planets is devoted to keeping [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]] - the universal embodiment of destruction and the antithesis of Eternity imprisoned - the team (Franklin Richards and Valeria Von Doom) resurrects Galactus, who is then instrumental in defeating the unleashed Abraxas.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual 2001''</ref>

Galactus appears prominently in ''[[Marvel: The End]]'' #1-6 (May-July 2003), and the limited series ''[[Thanos#Further challenges|Thanos #1-12]]'' (Dec. 2003 - May 2004). In another appearance, a weapon designed by Reed Richards and Johnny Storm succeeded in splitting Galactus into his two core components â€” Galan and the Power Cosmic. Galan then exiles himself in another dimension, hoping that this act will prevent the Power Cosmic from finding him.<ref>As herald - ''Fantastic Four''  #520-523 (Jan.-April 2005)</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #520-523 (Jan.-April 2005)</ref> The ruse fails; however, as the alien warrior [[Beta Ray Bill]] encounters a fully reformed Galactus shortly afterward.<ref>''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2005)</ref>

Galactus was also a central character in the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' crossover, first appearing as a co-star in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' (June-July 2006) followed by a pivotal role in the six-issue ''Annihilation'' limited series (Oct. 2006 - Mar. 2007). Galactus then appears in the two-issue [[epilogue]] ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus]]'' (April-May 2007). ''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' added further detail to the character's back story with the introduction of the "Proemial Gods". A faction of these beings attempted to gain total control of the universe during its formative years, causing a civil war. The war eventually involves Galactus, who slays the faction's leader and imprisons the surviving members in the [[Kyln]].<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2</ref> Escaping during the Annihilation wave, the remaining Proemial Gods ''Tenebrous of The Darkness Between'' and ''[[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis Lady of All Sorrows]]'' attack and defeat Galactus and the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1-4 (June-Sept. 2006)</ref>  An incapacitated Galactus is then imprisoned  by [[Annihilus]] &ndash; the creator of the Annihilation Wave &ndash; who plans to use Galactus' Power Cosmic as a bomb to destroy all life in the universe. [[Drax the Destroyer]] manages to free Galactus who in retaliation unleashes a blast that destroys most of the Annihilation Wave and more than three [[star system]]s. This forces the surviving parties to form a [[ceasefire|truce]].<ref>''Annihilation'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007).</ref>

Due to his vast power and intrinsic, natural role in the universal order, Galactus considers himself a higher being than all non-abstracts, coming to embody a force of [[cosmos|cosmic]] nature necessary for universal existence. Galactus maintains his existence by devouring planets that have the potential for supporting life. In so doing, he has consumed countless worlds, resulting in the elimination of entire [[extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial]] civilizations.

As a living force of nature,  Galactus' true form cannot be perceived by most beings,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #521 (Feb. 2005)</ref> and so each species perceives Galactus in a form they can comprehend, usually in a form similar to that of their own species. <ref name="ff262"/><ref name="stormbreaker1"/> However, he has consciously appeared as a humanoid star at certain occasions.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #10 (April 1988), ''Infinity Gauntlet'' #5 (Nov. 1991), and ''Super-Villain Classics'' #1 (May 1983)</ref> Galactus also requires his armor to help regulate internal energies. As Galactus must continuously feed to sustain himself, his power levels are inconsistent throughout any given period. For this reason, Earth's heroes have been able to achieve various degrees of success in repelling, or defeating, a starving, weakened Galactus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #243 (June 1982)</ref>

As the oldest known living entity in the universe, Galactus employs science that the most brilliant minds on Earth cannot begin to grasp. Examples include the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] (later revealed to be an aspect of Galactus' being)<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #478 (Jan. 2002)</ref> and Taa II.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #210 (Sept. 1979)</ref> 

Galactus has appointed a number of beings to act as his [[Herald of Galactus|Herald]], with each bestowed with a fraction of the [[Power Cosmic]].

==Other versions==
In addition to his mainstream incarnation, Galactus has also been depicted in other fictional universes, in which the character's history, circumstances and behavior vary from the mainstream setting. In some stories, other characters serves as Galactus.

=== Earth X ===
In ''[[Earth X]]'', Galactus is one of the three essential entities in the universe keeping the cosmic entities the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] in check. By destroying planets - actually "eggs" of the Celestials - Galactus prevents the Celestials from overpopulating the universe.<ref>''Earth X'' #1-12 (2000-2001)</ref>.

===Exiles===
In contrast to his normal role, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] featured a Galactus who restored rather than destroyed worlds.<ref>''Exiles''  #86 - 87 (Oct. - Nov. 2006)</ref>  

===Heroes Reborn===
Galactus appears in the pocket universe created by [[Franklin Richards]] (after the events of the ''[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]'' saga) and deploys several heralds at once.<ref>''Heroes Reborn'' (1996-1997)</ref> 

=== Manga Universe ===
Galactus appears as a gigantic, planet-sized life-form, and appears to have a single massive eye and tentacles to drain the life from planets. It is covered in various life-forms (referred to as "Galactus Spores") which aid its digestive process.<ref>''New Mangaverse'' vol. 2, #1-5 (2005-2006)</ref><ref>''Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes'' (2005)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Galactus battles the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', who consume the Silver Surfer and acquire a fraction of his cosmic power. With the help of advanced technology, the Zombies manage to eventually defeat and consume Galactus. The Zombies absorb his powers, assume his role and travel to different planets for sustenance.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' (2005-2006)</ref>

===MC2===
A future Galactus, accompanied by a new herald named [[Dominas]], appears in the [[MC2]] universe.<ref>''Last Planet Standing'' #1-5</ref>

=== Ultimate Galactus ===
{{main|Ultimate Galactus Trilogy}}
Ultimate Galactus, called '''Gah Lak Tus''', was introduced in a trilogy written by [[Warren Ellis]]. Ellis noted in a 2005 interview that 'Gah Lak Tus is a compound entity â€” it needs to be able to surround a planet, and it needs to be able to survive tens of thousands of years in space, which is a hugely destructive environment.'<ref>{{cite journal|title=Wizard|issue=168}}</ref> 
Gah Lak Tus is first mentioned by [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Vision|Ultimate Vision]], which is an early-warning system for worlds under threat by Gah Lak Tus and describes Gah Lak Tus as an immense (approx. {{convert|100000|mi|km}} long) [[collective intelligence|group mind]] of city-sized robotic drones that attacks worlds using envoys (resembling the [[Silver Surfer]]) followed by a flesh-eating virus that destroys all life. Reed Richards uses the Ultimate version of the [[Ultimate Nullifier]]- a weapon that channels the energies of another universe's Big Bang at the target- which destroys 20% of Gah Lak Tus's mass and forces it to retreat.<ref>''Ultimate Nightmare'' (2004); ''Ultimate Secret'' (2005); ''Ultimate Extinction'' (2006)</ref> 

=== DC Crossovers ===
Galactus has also appeared in three projects associated with the [[DC Universe]].<ref>''Darkseid vs. Galactus: The Hunger'' (1995)</ref><ref>''Superman, Fantastic Four: Infinite Destruction'' (1999)</ref><ref>''JLA:Avengers'' #1-3 (2003-2004)</ref>
