'''Galactus''', sometimes called the '''Devourer of Worlds''' or '''Eater of Planets''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character, a cosmic entity within [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Created by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48, the beginning of a [[story arc]] sometimes regarded as the finest Lee/Kirby collaboration.

==Character history==
{{spoiler}}
===Rebirth===
Originally named '''Galan''' (or '''Galen''', the spelling differs on occasion), he hails from the planet Taa, and is the sole survivor of the [[Big Crunch]] of the previous [[universe]] in which Taa was located. 

A [[outer space|space]] explorer investigating the impending end of his universe, his ship approached the focal point of the Big Crunch and was promptly destroyed.  Galen, the only survivor, was transformed into a cosmic entity even as the universe collapsed, after striking a deal with [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], who was about to be reborn in the next universe. 

After the [[Big Bang]] of the current universe, to complete his [[metamorphosis (biology)|transformation]], Galactus was encased in a [[cosmic egg]] brimming with enormous energies.  After billions of years, he emerged as an entity of vast cosmic power who was also necessary for the existence of the newly formed universe.  

Galactus is considered one of the five essential entities within the Marvel Universe alongside [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the personification of the universe, [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]] and Oblivion.

===The Destroyer of Worlds===
Though he wields the immeasurable '''Power Cosmic''' (indeed, Galactus is so powerful that he must always wear his costume in order to contain his vast energies; were he ever to remove it, the energy thus released would destroy Galactus and turn him into a star), Galactus must feed off the energy of [[planet]]s, without which he cannot survive. Towards this end, Galactus scours the universe seeking planets to sustain himself. 

Over millions of years he has become one of the most feared beings in the universe, his vast power allowing him to lay waste to innumerable [[Extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial]] [[civilization]]s in his quest for sustenance.

Nevertheless, he is not an [[evil]] being, but rather a force of nature whose feedings are necessary for survival. It is also said that Galactus plays a necessary role in the continuum of the Universe bringing randomness, which in turn balances with order, and if he were ever destroyed another being would have to take his place in this task.

===Heralds===
He has appointed a number of entities as his [[Herald of Galactus|heralds]], imbuing them with a portion of the Power Cosmic and sending them to search for edible worlds. Most of his heralds have rebelled or betrayed him.  

Among his heralds are the Fallen One, [[Silver Surfer]], [[Terrax]], [[Firelord]], [[Air-Walker]], the Air-Walker robot, [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]], an Earthwoman named Frankie Raye later known as [[Nova (comics)#Frankie_Raye|Nova]], [[Morg]], [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]], the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] armor, [[Johnny Storm|Human Torch]], [[Dazzler]], [[Superman]] (very briefly in the FF/Superman crossover) and Stardust (his current herald).

In stories in alternate and parallel realities, he also used unknown heralds: Plasma, Dark Angel, Kryptonian, [[Golden Oldie]], the Fantastic Four, Ardina, and Starglow.

===Attempts to destroy the Earth===
When Galactus threatened to destroy the [[Earth]], the [[Fantastic Four]] (aided by the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] [[Uatu]] and by Galactus' rebellious herald, the [[Silver Surfer]]) defeated him by threatening him with the [[Ultimate Nullifier]].  Galactus vowed to never again try to harm the Earth.

===Temporary death===
In the ''Galactus: The Devourer'' limited series (1999-2000), Galactus was killed after a battle against the united forces of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Fantastic Four]], [[Starjammers]], the [[Shi'ar]] Empire and an armada of other united planets (including even a [[Kree]] starship).  He died with an ominous warning that his death would allow a great evil to surface.  After his death, Galactus' true form was revealed, that of a [[star]].

That great evil emerged in ''Fantastic Four Annual 2001'' in the form of [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], an entity that was the antithesis of Eternity.  Abraxas was only defeated after it was revealed in ''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 2) #49 ([vol. 1] #478; January 2002) that Galactus was still alive.  [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], [[Franklin Richards]], and [[Valeria Richards|Valeria Von Doom]] had been incubating Galactus within Eternity.

===Humanoid===
In the 2005 Fantastic Four storyline ''[[Rising Storm]]'', Galactus was separated from his cosmic energy, and reverted to the humanoid form of Galen.  In tribute to "the indominitible spirit of the humanoid order", Galen willingly exiled himself into an other-universal realm, in apparent hope that this would prevent or delay the Galactus-energy-being from finding him. 

This did not last long, however, and as Galactus, he encountered [[Beta Ray Bill]] shortly after.

==Alternate realities==
===Earth X===
Galactus also made an appearance in the ''[[Earth X]]'' series, which lies outside the normal Marvel [[Earth-616|Earth 616]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], making it non-canon.  According to the ''Earth X'' series, Galactus was one of the three essential entities in the Marvel Universe not because he kept Abraxas at bay, but because he kept the [[Celestials]] at bay.  By destroying planets, which were really "eggs" of the [[Celestials]], he prevented the Celestials from overpopulating the universe.  In its previous incarnation, the universe was brought to a premature end by the overpopulation of Celestials.

When the threat of the gestating Celestial within Earth was discovered, Reed Richards was contacted by [[Machine Man|X-51]] to summon Galactus and destroy the Celestial. Unfortunately, in events which parallel Earth-616, Reed had turned Galactus into a star. However, he still sent [[Black Bolt]] on a suicide mission on the Moon to send a message into space. This message brought a being who appeared to be none other than Galactus himself, who then fought and killed several Celestials before terminating the gestating Celestial. After the battle, Reed asked Galactus to remove his mask, revealing that the devourer of worlds was actually his own missing son, Franklin. The sequels to Earth X (Universe X and Paradise X) later revealed that Franklin, distraught over his mother and uncle's deaths, had fled Earth with the armor of Galactus, convinced to take on the role of the cosmic entity. As Franklin had manifested the final stage of the Celestial seed within humanity, he believed he was Galactus and became Galactus. Reed could not even call his son by name when they met again on Earth. At the end of Paradise X, after Reed inherits [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Mar-vell's]] cosmic awareness, he states that his first act would be to rescue his son.

The original Galactus was also revealed to be connected to the [[Microverse]]. The energies of the Sword in the Star not only created the Microverse, but also empowered [[Captain Universe]] before Arcturus Rann ceded the power to Mar-vell. When the Psycho-Man conquered Homeworld with the power of hate and forced Mari to kill Arcturus Rann, the Micronauts fought their way out, stealing the Psycho-Man's Psycho-Caster. The "fear" effect of the Psycho-Caster drew the Man-Thing to the portal which the Mirconauts escaped through; as that which knows fear (or any other strong emotion) burns at the touch of the Man-Thing, the entirety of Subatomica was set ablaze by Man-Thing's tendrils. As a result, the energy which made up Subatomica, that from the Sword in the Star, threw itself backwards in time, to before the universe existed. There, it empowered Galan of Taa, to allow him to survive the previous universe and become Galactus. While Kyle Richmond claimed that the Sword itself was sentient, X-51 contradicted him on the Moon, saying that the Star was the sentient aspect: Galactus as a star.

===Ultimate Marvel===
While Galactus (called Gah Lak Tus here) has yet to actually appear in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, writer [[Warren Ellis]] is currently writing a trilogy of [[Miniseries|mini-series]] set in the Ultimate Universe that will introduce him.  The three include ''[[Ultimate Nightmare]]'', ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'', and ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]''.  Gah Lak Tus is mentioned by name from the Ultimate version of the [[Vision (comics) |Vision]] during ''Ultimate Nightmare'' and is set to be introduced in ''Ultimate Extinction''.
[[Image:GahLakTus.PNG|thumb|left|Gah Lak Tus's true form.  Art by Brandon Peterson..]]
He has been mentioned a few times in ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]'' in the current arc, as well as alluded to by an alien visitor in other series.

It has also been revealed that Ultimate Gah Lak Tus will be made up of 10,000 ten-story-tall insects.  This can be proven true by looking at the teaser and noticing that the forefront picture has several insect-like legs and that there are apparently three beings of the same stature.

==Quotations==
*"Of all the creatures in the vastness of the universe, there is none like me.  I was present at the birth of the universe, and I shall be there at its end.  Though I ravage worlds to live, I bear no malice to any living thing.  I simply do what I must to survive.  And why must Galactus survive? For, no matter how many worlds I devour... How many civilizations I destroy... It is my destiny to one day give back to the universe &mdash; infinitely more than I have ever taken from it.  So speaks Galactus."
:--Galactus, ''The Origin of Galactus'' ([[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comic]], 1996)

==Influence==
[[Image:CanMonsterMovieAlbumCover.jpg|left|100px|cover of Can's ''Monster Movie'' album]]
A faceless Galactus was featured on the cover of 1969's "Monster Movie," [[Can (band)|Can's]] debut album.

[[The Tick]] animated series had an episode (''Alone Together'') featuring a character named "Omnipotus" which was an extremely obvious parody of Galactus, down to the eating of worlds, although much less intelligent.  After being shot into space, the Tick briefly becomes the herald of Omnipotus, rebelling and later convincing Omnipotus to spare Earth.  He also appeared with the Tick's comic-book incarnation.

Although technically not an influence, per se, the [[Transformers (toyline)|Transformers]] character [[Unicron]] plays a very similar role in the series' mythos, even to the point of parodying his origins.  However, unlike Galactus, Unicron is thoroughly evil, and is more or less considered to be the Transformers' equivalent to the [[devil]] (with his counterpart, [[Primus_(Transformers) |Primus]], being the equivalent of [[God]]).

The syndicated comic ''Brewster Rockit: Space Guy!'' has a current storyline featuring a giant humanoid alien named Cosmicus who is attempting to devour the Earth.

==Other==
Galactus appeared in the 1994 Marvel cartoon show ''Fantastic Four'' with Silver Surfer.  He also regularly appeared as a Computer animated figure in the ''Silver Surfer'' cartoon series on [[Fox Kids|FOX Kids]] Network in 1997.

In the episode of "Fairly Oddparents" on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], called "Mighty Mom and Dyno Dad", [[Timmy Turner]] wishes himself to be a great superbeing called Tilactimus, the eater of planets, so he can make his parents vulnerable to magic.

In a comedic issue of Marvel's [[What If (comics)|What If?]] series, Galactus was banished to earth and lands outside a trailer park, suffering from amnesia. After he is discovered by a local, she declares that he looks exactly like a young Elvis Presley. Galactus/Elvis begins a music career but when he is finally confronted by a galactic being and given his memory back, he chooses to remain on Earth as the king of Rock N' Roll.

In the 1997 [[Fox Kids|FOX Kids]] cartoon "Sam and Max: Freelance Police"; the character of Galactus was also spoofed with in the form of the character 'Lactose the Intolerant'.
