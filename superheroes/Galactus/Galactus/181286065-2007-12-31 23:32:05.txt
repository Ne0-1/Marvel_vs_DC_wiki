'''Galactus''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cosmic entity]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] as an antagonist for the [[Fantastic Four]], the character [[first appeared]] in the [[comic book]] ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #48 (Mar. 1966), the first part of a three-issue story later known as "The Galactus Trilogy".<ref> Thomas, Roy, ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'' (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), "Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy", pp. 112-115. ISBN-10 1-4027-4225-8; ISBN-13 978-1-4027-4225-5</ref>

==Publication history==
Following his introduction in the [[superhero]]-team title ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #48-50 (March-May 1966), Galactus next appeared in a [[flashback]] [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 1, #37 (Feb. 1968) before physically returning to Earth to retrieve his herald, the [[Silver Surfer]], in actual and behind-the-scenes appearances throughout ''Fantastic Four'' #72-77 (March-Aug. 1968). He appears extensively in flashback, in the heretofore unrevealed origin of the Silver Surfer, in ''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 1, #1 (Aug. 1968).

Galactus' [[origin story]] climaxed a series of appearances in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' vol. 1, #160-162 (Jan.-March 1969) and #168-169 (Sept.-Oct. 1969), the latter of which, by writer Stan Lee, penciler and co-plotter Jack Kirby and [[inker]] [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]], revealed the character's beginnings. ''Super-Villain Classics'' #1 (May 1983) reprinted that 20-page tale with additions, edits, and deletions by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], and inkers [[Jack Abel]] and [[Vince Colletta]] to create an updated, 23-page origin story titled "Galactus". This in turn was reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (Feb. 1996).

Galactus has made numerous guest appearances throughout the decades, and starred in the six-issue [[limited series|miniseries]] ''Galactus the Devourer'' (Sept. 1999 - March 2000).

==Fictional character biography==
===Rebirth===
[[Image:Galan-galactus.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The ''Sentience of the Universe'' merges with Galan of Taa in the [[Cosmic egg]].]]
Originally named Galan of the planet Taa, Galactus is the sole survivor of the [[Big Crunch]] of the universe that existed prior to occurrence of the [[Big Bang]], which led to the present-day [[Marvel Universe]].  

Galan was a space explorer investigating the impending end of his universe. Eventually, Taa was engulfed by a radiation plague that killed almost all its inhabitants. At the last second, Galan escapes the doomed planet in a star-ship with a few other survivors. Rather than perish from the lethal radiation that had extinguished all life across the universe, Galan proposes to his crewmates that they pilot their craft directly into the center of the Big Crunch. As he approaches the [[Cosmic egg]] — the focal point of the Big Crunch and the source of the exterminating radiation — his ship and crew are promptly destroyed.  At the moment Galan's universe meets its end, the incarnation of that reality's [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]] amasses the positive emotions of all living beings in the cosmos to preserve them from eternal damnation, enabling the "Sentience of the Universe" &mdash; that universe's incarnation of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] &mdash; to meet with Galan.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/OHOTMU:Data_Corrections_Fantastic_Four_2005 ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Data Corrections Fantastic Four 2005'']. URL last checked 2006-09-01.</ref><ref>''Adventures of X-Men'' #12</ref> Within the Cosmic Egg the 
Sentience of the Universe reveals itself to Galan and informs him that though they both will die in the impending cataclysm, they will survive through a joint heir born into the next universe. The Sentience of the Universe then merges itself with the mortal Galan, establishing Galan as the sole survivor of the ensuing Big Crunch. This union ultimately leads to his rebirth in the present universe as Galactus.<ref name="svc">''Super-Villain Classics'' #1 (May 1983)</ref>  After the Big Bang and the birth of the present reality, Galactus gestates in a cocoon of cosmic energy to complete his [[metamorphosis]], and after millions of years emerges as an entity of vast cosmic power who is essential and intrinsic to the newly formed universe.<ref name="svc" />

Galactus is considered one of the three essential entities within the Marvel Universe alongside [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and has been referred to as the "third force of the universe." <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #10 (April 1988)</ref> Eternity and Death consider Galactus a peer and a sibling, with Death actually referring to Galactus on one occasion as "husband, father, brother, and son." <ref name="fantastic257">''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #257 (Aug. 1983)</ref> <!--Passive-voice [[WP:WEASEL]]. Let's please say WHO suggests:   It has also been suggested that the entity the [[In-Betweener]] is Galactus' metaphysical counterpart. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18</ref>-->

In the [[Earth-616|prime Marvel Universe]], Galactus is one of the three beings that has representation on one of the faces of the [[Living Tribunal]], with each face representing one of the essential forces of reality.<ref name="silversurfer31">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec, 1989)</ref>

===The Devourer of Worlds===
[[Image:Devourworlds.png‎|thumb|right|400px|Galactus roams the universe in search of planets to sustain himself.]]
Due to his vast power and intrinsic, natural role in the universal order, Galactus considers himself a higher being than all non-abstracts,  coming to embody a force of [[cosmos|cosmic]] nature and proving to be a necessary component for universal existence. Galactus maintains his existence by devouring planets that have the potential for supporting life; in so doing, he has consumed countless worlds, resulting in the elimination of entire [[extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial]] civilizations. Frequently, Galactus utilizes a [[Herald of Galactus|herald]] to scour the universe in search of sustenance. Upon pinpointing the requisite planetary body, the herald will signal Galactus, resulting in the Devourer's arrival on the world's surface and the deployment of the Elemental Converter &mdash; a colossal machine capable of draining all life energy from the planet within minutes. While the Converter makes consumption of the planet's energy more efficient, Galactus is capable of feeding without its aid.<ref name="fantastic257"/>

Galactus has appointed a number of beings to act as his [[Heralds of Galactus|herald]], with each bestowed a fraction of the [[Power Cosmic]]. His known heralds have included:

*The [[Fallen One]] <ref>''Thanos'' #11 (Aug. 2004)</ref>
*The [[Silver Surfer]] <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #48 (March 1966)</ref>
*[[Air-Walker]] (and later Air-Walker android),<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #120 (March 1972)</ref>
*[[Firelord]] <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #225 (July 1974)</ref>
*The Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] armor,<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' vol. 1, #228</ref>
*[[Terrax]] <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #211 (October 1979)</ref>
*[[Frankie Raye|Nova]] <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #244 (July 1982)</ref>
*[[Morg]] <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #70 (Aug. 1992)</ref>
*[[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]] <ref>''Galactus the Devourer''#1 - 6 (1999 - 2000)</ref>
*The [[Human Torch]] <ref>As herald - ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #520-523 (Jan.-April 2005)</ref> 
*[[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]] <ref>''Stormbreaker: The Sage of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6(2005)</ref>

Following the events of [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]], his current heralds are Stardust and the Silver Surfer.

===Earth===
[[Image:FantasticFour49.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''Fantastic Four'' #49 (April 1966), Galactus' first appearance. Art by [[Jack Kirby]] & [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
Galactus has threatened to consume the [[Earth]] on several occasions. During the first encounter, the cosmic entity the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and Galactus' rebellious herald, the [[Silver Surfer]], aid the [[Fantastic Four]]. Galactus is defeated when [[Mister Fantastic]] threatens him with the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], which was retrieved by the [[Human Torch]] from [[Taa II]]. Galactus leaves and vows to never attack the Earth again,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #48-50 (March-May 1966)</ref> though he eventually returns to Earth, seeking the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #74-77 (May-Aug 1968)</ref> On Earth, Mr. Fantastic petitions Galactus to stop the threat of the cosmic entity the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]], releasing Galactus from his vow.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #210 - 213 (Sept.-Dec. 1979)</ref>

In one encounter, Galactus returns to Earth in pursuit of his rebellious herald, [[Terrax]]. Galactus expends a considerable amount of energy in the pursuit, and finally arrives with the intention of consuming Earth to replenish himself. A hungry and weakened Galactus resolves the issue with Terrax, but is so diminished in power that he is defeated by the combined efforts of the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and [[Doctor Strange]]. However, rather than let Galactus die of hunger, Mister Fantastic uses a device powered by the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to reinvigorate him. Grateful, Galactus proclaims that Earth is safe from his feedings before departing.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #242-244 (May-July 1982)</ref>

Mister Fantastic's actions have consequences, however, as he is later placed on trial by a consortium of alien worlds for saving Galactus,  which would indirectly cause the deaths of the worlds Galactus would later consume. The [[Shi'ar]] preside over the trial, and look to execute Mister Fantastic until the cosmic entity [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] is summoned by the combined efforts of Galactus and the Watcher. Eternity then enables the millions of alien onlookers to momentarily become one with the universe, temporarily granting them the clarity that Galactus is an essential part of the natural order of the cosmos.<ref name="ff262">''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #262 (Jan. 1984)</ref>

===Temporary death===
Galactus was apparently killed when the Silver Surfer turned Galactus' own Elemental Converter against him. As Galactus dies he warns that his death will allow a great evil to surface. After his death, Galactus' remains took the form of a [[star]].<ref>''Galactus the Devourer'' #1-6 (Sept. 1999 - March 2000)</ref> The great evil Galactus spoke of later emerged in the form of the Biblical demon [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], the universal embodiment of destruction and the antithesis of Eternity. The Fantastic Four discovered that most of the energy Galactus took from planets was devoted to keeping Abraxas imprisoned. One can now see at this point that Galactus's actions though unfortunate and sometimes tragic are necessary to prevent the ultimate destruction of everything as Abraxas planned the destruction of everything. <ref>''Fantastic Four Annual 2001''<!--year is part of title--></ref> [[Franklin Richards]] pools his power with that of his sister, [[Valeria Richards|Valeria Von Doom]], and reconstitutes Galactus, but the siblings permanently burn out their powers in doing so. The newly reformed Galactus reclaims the Ultimate Nullifier from Abraxas, and Fantastic Four leader Reed Richards uses it to keep Abraxas imprisoned. The Ultimate Nullifier is revealed to be an aspect of Galactus himself.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #478 (Jan. 2002)</ref>

Later, however, Reed Richards designs a weapon with the express purpose of stripping Galactus of the Power Cosmic. The creation of the device is made possible with help from [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] and [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], who is cosmically aware at this time.<ref>As herald - ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #520-523 (Jan.-April 2005)</ref>  The weapon succeeds in separating Galactus into his two core components &mdash; Galan and the Power Cosmic. Galan then exiles himself in another dimension, hoping that this act will prevent the Power Cosmic from finding him.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #520-523 (Jan.-April 2005)</ref> The ruse fails, however, as the alien warrior [[Beta Ray Bill]] encounters a fully reformed Galactus shortly afterward. <ref>''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2005)</ref>

===Annihilation===
Galactus is a member of a group of entities called the "Cosmic Balance". After a brutal civil war that only three beings survived &mdash; Galactus the Devourer of Worlds, Tenebrous of the Darkness Between, and Aegis the Lady of All Sorrows &mdash;  Galactus imprisons his brethren in the Kyln, until the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] frees them.  Knowing of their escape, Galactus augments his herald the Silver Surfer and engages them.<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1-4 (June-Sept. 2006)</ref> The battle brings Galactus into contact with the beings [[Thanos]], [[Drax the Destroyer]], and [[Annihilus]], the mastermind behind the Annihilation Wave. The Annihilation Wave are destroyed by a massive blast from Galactus resulting in an armistice between all parties.  The blast also destroys a [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] along with at least three star systems. <ref>''Annihilation'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Galactuspov.PNG|225px|thumb|right|Galactus, as various species perceive him. Panel from ''Fantastic Four'' vol 1, #262 (Jan. 1984). Art by [[John Byrne]].]] 
Galactus is the physical, metamorphosed embodiment of a cosmos, a product of the union between the ''Sentience of the Universe'' and Galan.<ref name="fantastic522"> ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #522 (March 2005)</ref> As such, Galactus wields the '''[[Power Cosmic]]''' and has been described as "the most feared being in the universe." <ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #2 (July 2006)</ref>  Galactus can employ the Power Cosmic to produce nearly any effect he desires, including size-alteration,<ref name="rom">''Rom'' #27 (Feb. 1982)</ref> the molecular restructuring and [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of matter,<ref name="ss1">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 1, #1 (Aug. 1968)</ref> the [[teleportation]] of objects &mdash; even entire [[galaxy|galaxies]]<ref name="rom" /> &mdash; across [[space]] and [[time]],<ref>''[[Secret Wars|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' #9 (Jan. 1985)</ref> the projection of energy with vast destructive force,<ref name="SS3#18">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18 (Dec. 1988)</ref> the erection of nearly impenetrable [[force field (science fiction)|force fields]],<ref name="ss1" /> the creation of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|interdimensional]]<ref>''Thanos'' #3 (Feb. 2004)</ref> and intradimensional [[Portal (fiction)|portals]],<ref>''Thanos'' #12 (Sept. 2004)</ref> [[telepathy]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #242 (May 1982)</ref> [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]],<ref> ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #49 (April 1966)</ref> and [[List of comic book superpowers#Cross-dimensional awareness|cosmic awareness]] on a universal scale.<ref> ''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #9 </ref>

Galactus has even shown the abilities to create sentient life in the form of [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]],<ref>''Cosmic Powers Unlimited'' #2 (Sept. 1995)</ref> resurrect his herald [[Morg]],<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #76 (Jan. 1993)</ref> manipulate mortal souls,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #49 (May 1991)</ref> memories and emotions,<ref name="surfer130">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #130 (Aug. 1997)</ref> and remake dead worlds &mdash; including populations &mdash; in every detail.<ref name="surfer130"/>

Galactus requires his armor to help regulate his internal energies. As Galactus must continuously feed to sustain himself, his power levels are inconsistent throughout any given period. For this reason, Earth's heroes have been able to achieve various degrees of success in repelling, or defeating, a starving, weakened Galactus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #243 (June 1982)</ref>

As the oldest known living entity in the universe, Galactus employs science that the most brilliant minds on Earth cannot begin to grasp. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #210 (Sept. 1979)</ref> The [[Ultimate Nullifier]] and [[Taa II]] are prime examples of Galactus' technology.

===Physical appearance===
As a being who is both an abstract entity (e.g. [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], et al) and a physical creature, Galactus' true form and nature are beyond the capability of mortal beings to comprehend.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #521 (Feb 2005)</ref> Despite being frequently illustrated as a giant, armored humanoid, each species perceives Galactus to be a form it can understand.<ref name="ff262"/><ref name="stormbreaker1"/> Galactus has adopted the appearance of a roughly humanoid energy being on at least three occasions. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #10 (April 1988), ''Infinity Gauntlet'' #5 (Nov. 1991), and ''Super-Villain Classics'' #1 (May 1983)</ref>

==Other versions==
===DC Universe===
Galactus has appeared in three projects associated with the [[DC Universe]]. <ref>''Superman, Fantastic Four: Infinite Destruction'' (1999) and ''Darkseid vs. Galactus: The Hunger'' (1995)</ref>  <ref>''JLA:Avengers'' # 1- 3 (2003 - 2004), in ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' (2006)</ref>

===Earth X===
Galactus also appears in the non-canon ''[[Earth X]]'' series. In ''Earth X'' Galactus is one of the three essential entities in the universe keeping the cosmic entities the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] in check. By destroying planets - actually "eggs" of the Celestials - Galactus prevents the Celestials from overpopulating the universe. <ref>''Earth X'' #1-12 (2000 - 2001)</ref>

===''Epic Illustrated''===
The [[anthology]] comics-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26-34 (Oct, 1984 - Feb. 1986) published the first nine serialized installments of a projected 10-part tale, "The Last Galactus Story", by writer-penciler [[John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin]]. Each ran six pages, with the exception of part eight, which ran 12 pages. The magazine was canceled at this point, leaving the story unfinished.

Set 100,000,000 years in the future, Galactus devours a now uninhabited Earth.  Accompanied by Nova, Galactus follows the trail of destroyed galaxies to the core of the Milky Way. Byrne wrote on his [[website]] that the story's conclusion involved Galactus combating a rogue Watcher until the death of the universe. When only Galactus and his herald, Nova, remain, Galactus cracks open his armor, releasing a new Big Bang. With the end of Galactus and the birth of a new universe, Nova is transformed into the Galactus for the new universe.<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57  Byrne Robotics: Frequently Asked Questions - Questions about Aborted Storylines]</ref>

===Exiles===
The [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] encountered one reality where Galactus is the restorer, rather than devourer of worlds; however, he only restores worlds that have been destroyed by the Blight, thus resulting in the rebellion of the Silver Surfer when he refused to grant the Surfer the power to restore his own world. <ref>''Exiles'' vol. 1, #86 - 87</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
Galactus appears in the pocket universe created by Franklin Richards - after the events of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] saga - and deploys several heralds at once. He actually succeeds in consuming the Earth twice, although this is undone by [[Doctor Doom]] with the use of his time machine until the Surfer is finally convinced to turn against his master and give the heroes the chance to drive Galactus away.<ref>''Heroes Reborn'' (1996 - 1997)</ref>

===Mangaverse===
In the Earth-2301 universe <ref>''Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes'' (2005)</ref> the Manga Galactus appears as a gigantic, planet-sized lifeform (similar to [[Ego the Living Planet]] and [[Unicron]]). It appears to have a single massive eye and has tenticles which drain the life from planets. It is covered in various lifeforms (referred to as "Galactus Spores") which aid its digestive process. <ref>''New Mangaverse'' v2 #1 - 5 (2005 - 2006)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
Galactus appears in "classic" form and battles the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', who have recently consumed the Silver Surfer and acquired portions of his cosmic power. With the help of some advanced technology, they manage to overpower, ultimately defeat and consume Galactus, thus absorbing his powers and becoming his 'successors' and later traveling to different planets for sustenance.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' (2005 - 2006)</ref>

===MC2===
Galactus, accompanied by a new herald named [[Dominas]], appears in the [[MC2]] universe. <ref>''Last Planet Standing'' #1-5</ref>

===Ultimate Gah Lak Tus===
{{main|Ultimate Galactus trilogy}}
Ultimate Galactus, called '''Gah Lak Tus''', was introduced in a trilogy written by [[Warren Ellis]]. Gah Lak Tus is first mentioned by [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Visions|Ultimate Vision]], which is an early-warning system for worlds under threat by Gah Lak Tus and describes Gah Lak Tus as an immense (approx. 100,000 miles long) group mind of city-sized robotic drones that attacks worlds using envoys (resembling the [[Silver Surfer]]) followed by a flesh-eating virus that destroys all life. After this the entity breaks open the dying world and sucks all thermal energy from the core. Gah Lak Tus considers all forms and expressions of organic life to be so abhorrent it believed itself desecrated when telepathically contacted by [[Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Professor X]]. It was eventually driven back by [[Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Mr. Fantastic|Mister Fantastic]] via his use of the [[Ultimate Nullifier#Ultimate Ultimate Nullifier|Ultimate Nullifier]]- here a weapon that tapped into the energies released by the Big Bang of a young universe- destroying 20% of Gah Lak Tus's mass and forcing the drones to retreat. <ref>''Ultimate Nightmare'' (2004); ''Ultimate Secret'' (2005) & ''Ultimate Extinction'' (2006).</ref>
