'''Galactus''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Formerly a mortal man, Galactus is a [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] who originally consumed planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the [[Earth-616|primary Marvel continuity]]. Galactus was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the comic book ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48, published in March 1966.

Lee and Kirby had desired to introduce a character that broke away from the archetype of the standard villain, culminating in the creation of Galactus. In the character's first appearance in ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'', Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy, and operates without regard to the morality and judgements of mortal beings. Galactus' initial origin was that of a space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] further developed the origin of the character, revealing that Galan lived during the previous universe. As Galan's universe came to an end, Galan merged with the "[[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]" to become Galactus, an entity that wielded such cosmic power as to require devouring entire planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Jim Starlin]], and [[Louise Simonson]] explored Galactus' role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the actions of the character through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the [[Silver Surfer]]), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity.

The character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as [[arcade game]]s, [[video game]]s, animated television series, and the 2007 film ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.

===Origin===
{{Main article|The Galactus Trilogy}}
In 1966, nearly five years after launching [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the [[supervillain]] mold of the time with god-like stature and power.<ref name="kirbycollector1" /> As Lee recalled in 1993,
{{quote|Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. Having dreamed up [many] powerful baddies ... we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of demi-god, but now what would we do with him. We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. ... That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god would be beyond mere good and evil. ... [What] he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!<ref>Lee, Stan. "Introduction" (second page, unnumbered) 1993, ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 5''<!--as spelled in copyright indicia--> (Marvel Publishing : second edition, second printing, 2007) ISBN 978-0-7851-1184-9</ref>}}
<!--Wiki MOS is to use blockquotes for quotes four lines or longer-->
Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the [[Silver Surfer]]:
{{quote|My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales. And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. ...I had to get something new. And ... for some reason, I went to the Bible. And I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well, because I always felt him, and I certainly couldn't treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal ... and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel. ...[T]hey were figures that have never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures, and of course, they were the first gods.<ref>{{cite video

Kirby elaborated, "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way."<ref>Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert.

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation: "In five short years from the launch of the ''Fantastic Four'', the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the [[Skrull]]s, the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

This led to the introduction of Galactus in ''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling "[[The Galactus Trilogy]]".<ref name="TR"/><ref name="kirbycollector1" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fein |first=Eric |title=The Creation of the Fantastic Four |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |page=48}}</ref><ref>[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]].

===1960s===
In order to preserve Galactus's mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking [[cameo appearance|cameos]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #134 (November 1966), and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #37 (February 1968). Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in ''Fantastic Four'' #72–77 (March–August 1968).<ref name="kirbycollector2"/><ref>[http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/2012/06/19/a-failure-to-communicate-part-two A Failure to Communicate, Part 2], Jack Kirby Museum, June 19, 2012 (accessed February 14, 2015)</ref> After a flashback appearance in ''Silver Surfer'' #1 (August 1968), the character returned to Earth in ''Thor'' #160–162 (January–March 1969). Galactus's origin was revealed in ''Thor'' #168–169 (September–October 1969).

===1970s and 1980s===
The character made appearances in ''Fantastic Four'' #120–123 (March–June 1972) and ''Thor'' #225–228 (July–October 1974). These two storylines introduced two new [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds for Galactus]]. Galactus also featured in ''Fantastic Four'' #172–175 (July–October 1976) and #206–213 (May–December 1979).

[[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot [[graphic novel]] ''The Silver Surfer, The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!'' in 1978. This [[Marvel Fireside Books|Marvel Fireside Book]], published by [[Simon & Schuster]], was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.

The full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume ''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983), inked by [[Vince Colletta]] and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]], lettered by [[Jack Morelli|John Morelli]] and colored by [[Andy Yanchus]]. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and inker [[Jack Abel]]. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters [[World egg#Influences on science fiction and popular culture|the core of the collapsing universe]] before the [[Big Bang]]; the story was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (February 1996).

The character guest-starred in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #26–27 (January–February 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of ''Fantastic Four'' #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #262 (January 1984) sparked controversy. At the end of the story, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; [[Howard University]] professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] of using the character to "justify planetary-scale genocide."<ref>Singer, Marc. [http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005911.html "Byrne's Fantastic Four, or Optimism"] Howling Curmudgeons (fan site), 18 May 2004. [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9XIKXrX WebCitation archive].</ref> Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which it's revealed that after the Surfer's rebellion against Galactus, the planet eater returned to Zenn-La, the Surfer's homeworld, and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee.

Writer-penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced "The Last Galactus Story" as a serial in the [[anthology]] comic-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26–34 (October 1984–February 1986). Nine of a scheduled ten installments appeared. Each ran six pages, except part eight (which ran 12). The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website.<ref name="byrnerobotics.com">[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]], [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 "Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'"], "Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines", Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005.

Artist [[John Buscema]] of the original Silver Surfer series produced a 64-page hardcover comic made all of full-page splash panels that Stan Lee scripted. It was published in October 1988 as ''Silver Surfer: Judgment Day''. In it, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] kidnaps two of Galactus's heralds, the Silver Surfer and Nova. Galactus himself invades Mephisto's realm to reclaim them. The cosmic battle between Mephisto and Galactus ends when the latter starts to absorb the life energy of Mephisto's "brimstone world", forcing the lord of evil to concede.

===1990s===
Galactus was featured in the miniseries ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1–6 (July&nbsp;– December 1991), ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1–6 (June&nbsp;– November 1992) and ''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (March&nbsp;– August 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries ''Galactus the Devourer'' (September 1999&nbsp;– March 2000), written by [[Louise Simonson]] and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus's death. Simonson originally conceived that the [[story arc]] would occur in the third volume of ''Silver Surfer'', but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a "radical" idea concerning "why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus."<ref>[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html "Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning..."], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d. Retrieved 14 April 2008. [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9bxLffx WebCitation archive].</ref>

===2000s===
The consequences of Galactus's death are explored in the ''Fantastic Four'' Annual 2001 and ''Fantastic Four'' #46–49 (October 2001&nbsp;– January 2002), resulting in Galactus's revival. The character features in the first six issues of the series ''[[Thanos]]'' (December 2003&nbsp;– May 2004), written by [[Jim Starlin]]. The story is noteworthy due to its evaluation of the standard justifications ([[Social Darwinism]] and [[divine right of kings]]) for the character (by defending the need for a [[social contract]] with the rest of the universe) and its search for alternate means to feed his hunger. Issues #7–12, written by [[Keith Giffen]], introduce the first herald (the Fallen One).

Galactus's origin is re-examined in ''Fantastic Four'' #520–523 (October 2004&nbsp;– April 2005), where the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1–6 (March–August 2005) Galactus was a central character in the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" storyline, appearing in the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' #1–4 (June–September 2006), ''Annihilation'' #1–6 (October 2006&nbsp;– March 2007) and the [[epilogue]], ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus]]'' #1–2 (February–April 2007).

Galactus was an antagonist in ''Fantastic Four'' #545–546 (June–July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function [[Epoch (Marvel Comics)|Epoch]]. In ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' vol. 4, #13–15 (May–July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author [[Andy Lanning]] said that he and co-writer [[Dan Abnett]] were "treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping."<ref>Rogers,Vaneta. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=153225 "Galactus, and Surfer and Skrulls – Oh My! Abnett & Lanning on Nova"], ''[[Newsarama]]'', 10 April 2008 [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9cJPcN1 WebCitation archive].</ref> Galactus also appeared in the limited series ''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1–3 (June–August 2009), a sequel to ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill''.

===2010s===
Galactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in ''[[Skaar (character)|Skaar]]: Son of Hulk'' #9-11, and as protagonists in the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' (June–November 2010). Galactus was a member of the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]] in the miniseries ''[[Chaos War]]'' #2–5 (December–March 2010). After an appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #583–587 (November 2010&nbsp;– March 2011), the character returned to Earth in ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 6, #1–5 (January–May 2011) and was the antagonist in ''The Mighty Thor'' #1–6 (April–September 2011).

In April 2015, Galactus made an appearance in issue 4 of the series ''[[The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl]]'' and issue 2 of the series ''[[Howard the Duck]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Galactus was originally the explorer Galan, from the planet Taa, which existed in the prime [[Cyclic model|pre-Big Bang universe]]. When an unknown cosmic cataclysm gradually kills all other life in his universe, he and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the [[Big Crunch]]. Galan does not die, however; he is transformed by bonding with the [[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]. He gestates for billions of years in the current universe which formed after the [[Big Bang]], emerging as Galactus. A [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] (Ecce) sees Galactus's emergence from his gestation vessel; although the Watcher recognizes his destructive nature, he chooses not to kill him.<ref name="origin">''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983).

Galactus later becomes involved in a civil war among the Proemial Gods, who came into being during the universe's infancy as the initial caretakers of cosmic consonance. After time, the Proemial Gods become self-aware, and a faction of the gods (led by Diableri of Chaos) attempt to remake the universe in their image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons three other rebel gods ([[Antiphon (comics)|Antiphon]], [[Tenebrous (Marvel Comics)|Tenebrous]], and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]]) in the [[Kyln]].<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (2007)</ref>

The heroes succeed, and the newly empowered Terrax leads his master to Earth. Galactus finds the Sphinx in [[Egypt]], defeats him, and retreats when Mr. Fantastic threatens to use a fake [[Ultimate Nullifier]] while the Watcher, again interfering, prevents Galactus from reading Richards' mind.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206–213 (May–December 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, believing that Terrax was trapped in a black hole, Galactus summoned the mutant known as [[Dazzler]] and empowered her to cosmic scale and temporarily made her into his herald, as he thought that Dazzler was one of the few beings in the universe that stood a chance of shedding light inside a black hole.<ref name="Dazzler #10">''Dazzler'' #10</ref> Once inside the black hole, however, Dazzler found that Terrax was not trapped, but was actually hiding from his master. A fight started and, as Dazzler was still empowered by sound blasts that Galactus's ship kept firing inside the black hole, she was able to render Terrax unconscious. She returned the herald to his master and Galactus then went on with his usual business, forgetting about Dazzler. Only by glowing incredibly bright did she make her presence known and bring Galactus to return her to Earth.<ref name="Dazzler #11">''Dazzler'' #11</ref>

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
In 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on [[IGN]]'s list of "Top 100 Comic Book Villains".  They cited his "larger than life presence" as making him one of the more important villains ever created, and that his ties to Earth and its heroes make him one of the greats. They also felt that "Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer" because he is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/5.html "Galactus is number 5"] [[IGN]], 2009.</ref>

==Other versions==
Numerous versions of Galactus exist in alternate universes.

After Earth's superhumans are killed or injured trying to stop him, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in this reality) attacks Galactus and is killed. Parker's courageous death inspires the Surfer to turn on Galactus, who flees Earth.

==={{anchor|DC Crossovers}}DC crossovers===
Galactus has appeared in three [[DC Comics]] crossover stories: ''[[Darkseid]]/Galactus: The Hunger'', ''[[Superman]]/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'' and ''[[JLA/Avengers]]''.

The plan fails when Galactus chooses Superman instead, but Superman's strong will and the scale of influence that the destruction of Krypton has had on his development allows Superman to resist Galactus's conditioning. At the conclusion of the story, Superman and Reed Richards reprogram Galactus's equipment to drain energy from him instead of planets, ordering him to only feed on lifeless worlds in future. With the Cyborg's deception exposed, Galactus turns the Cyborg into a metal block in response to his pleas for perfection.<ref>''Superman/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'' #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.</ref>

Marvel Comics/DC Comics.</ref> As a result, the Justice League and the Avengers are manipulated into competing against each other to acquire twelve items of power from their respective universes, but although the League - serving as the Grandmaster's team - wins the conflict, Krona kills Galactus and the Grandmaster to obtain the knowledge he seeks<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref> (nearly destroying both universes despite the Grandmaster using the assembled items to briefly trap Krona)<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #3.
