===Origin===
{{Main|The Galactus Trilogy}}
In 1966, nearly five years after launching [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the [[supervillain]] mold of the time with god-like stature and power.<ref name=kirbycollector1>Hatfield, Charles. "The Galactus Trilogy: An Appreciation", ''The Collected Jack Kirby Collector'', February 2004, p. 211</ref> As Lee recalled in 1993,
{{quote|Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. Having dreamed up [many] powerful baddies ... we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of demi-god, but now what would we do with him. We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. ... That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god would be beyond mere good and evil. ... [What] he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!<ref>Lee, Stan. "Introduction" (second page, unnumbered) 1993, ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 5''<!--as spelled in copyright indicia--> (Marvel Publishing : second edition, second printing, 2007) ISBN 978-0-7851-1184-9</ref>}}
<!--Wiki MOS is to use blockquotes for quotes four lines or longer-->
Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the [[Silver Surfer]]:
{{quote|My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales. And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. ...I had to get something new. And ... for some reason, I went to the Bible. And I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well, because I always felt him, and I certainly couldn't treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal ... and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel. ...[T]hey were figures that have never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures, and of course, they were the first gods.<ref>{{cite video

Kirby elaborated, "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way."<ref>Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert.

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation: "In five short years from the launch of the ''Fantastic Four'', the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the [[Skrull]]s, the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

This led to the introduction of Galactus in ''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling "[[The Galactus Trilogy]]".<ref name="TR"/><ref name=kirbycollector1/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fein |first=Eric |title=The Creation of the Fantastic Four |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |pages=48}}</ref><ref>[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]].

===1960s===
Galactus returned for a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #134 (November 1966), although the plot was unresolved when Kirby put the character on hiatus.<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> Galactus reappeared in a flashback cameo in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #37 (February 1968), and featured heavily in ''Fantastic Four'' #72–77 (March–August 1968) at Lee's request.<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> After a flashback appearance in ''Silver Surfer'' #1 (August 1968), the character returned to Earth in ''Thor'' #160–162 (January–March 1969, which resolved the plotline from issue #134). Galactus's origin was revealed in ''Thor '' #168–169 (September–October 1969).

===1970s and 1980s===
The character made appearances in ''Fantastic Four'' #120–123 (March–June 1972) and ''Thor'' #225–228 (July–October 1974). These two storylines introduced two new [[Galactus#Heralds|heralds for Galactus]]. Galactus also featured in ''Fantastic Four'' #172–175 (July–October 1976) and #206–213 (May–December 1979).

[[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot [[graphic novel]] ''The Silver Surfer, The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!'' in 1978. This [[Marvel Fireside Books|Marvel Fireside Book]], published by [[Simon & Schuster]], was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.

The full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume ''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983), inked by [[Vince Colletta]] and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]], lettered by [[Jack Morelli|John Morelli]] and colored by [[Andy Yanchus]]. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits and deletions by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and inker [[Jack Abel]]. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters [[World egg#Influences on science fiction and popular culture|the core of the collapsing universe]] before the [[Big Bang]]; the story was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (February 1996).

The character guest-starred in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #26–27 (January–February 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of ''Fantastic Four'' #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #262 (January 1984) sparked controversy. At the end of the story [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus; [[Howard University]] professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] of using the character to "justify planetary-scale genocide."<ref>Singer, Marc.

[http://www.webcitation.org/5v9XIKXrX WebCitation archive].</ref>

Writer-penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced "The Last Galactus Story" as a serial in the [[anthology]] comic-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26–34 (October 1984–February 1986). Nine of a scheduled ten installments appeared. Each ran six pages, except part eight (which ran 12). The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website.<ref name="byrnerobotics.com">[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]], [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 "Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'"], "Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines", Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005.

The current wording is the result of consensus.--> the Sentience of the previous universe, in the [[World egg|Cosmic egg]] (art by Jack Kirby and John Byrne)]] Galactus played a pivotal role in the [[limited series]] ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985), and became a recurring character in the third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'' (beginning with issue #1, July 1987).

===1990s===
Galactus was featured in the miniseries ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1–6 (July&nbsp;– December 1991), ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1–6 (June&nbsp;– November 1992) and ''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (March&nbsp;– August 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries ''Galactus the Devourer'' (September 1999&nbsp;– March 2000), written by [[Louise Simonson]] and illustrated by [[John Buscema]], which climaxed with Galactus's death. Simonson originally conceived that the [[story arc]] would occur in the third volume of ''Silver Surfer'', but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a "radical" idea concerning "why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus."<ref>[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html "Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning..."], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d. Retrieved 14 April 2008. [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9bxLffx WebCitation archive].</ref>

===2000s===
The consequences of Galactus's death are explored in the ''Fantastic Four'' Annual 2001 and ''Fantastic Four'' #46–49 (October 2001&nbsp;– January 2002), resulting in Galactus's revival. The character features in the first six issues of the series ''[[Thanos]]'' (December 2003&nbsp;– May 2004), written by [[Jim Starlin]]. The story is noteworthy due to its evaluation of the standard justifications ([[Social Darwinism]] and [[divine right of kings]]) for the character (by defending the need for a [[social contract]] with the rest of the universe) and its search for alternate means to feed his hunger. Issues #7–12, written by [[Keith Giffen]], introduce the first herald (the Fallen One).

Galactus's origin is re-examined in ''Fantastic Four'' #520–523 (October 2004&nbsp;– April 2005), where the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1–6 (March–August 2005) Galactus was a central character in the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" storyline, appearing in the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' #1–4 (June–September 2006), ''Annihilation'' #1–6 (October 2006&nbsp;– March 2007) and the [[epilogue]], ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus]]'' #1–2 (February–April 2007).

Galactus was an antagonist in ''Fantastic Four'' #545–546 (June–July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function [[List of Marvel Comics characters: E#Epoch|Epoch]]. In ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' vol. 4, #13–15 (May–July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author [[Andy Lanning]] said that he and co-writer [[Dan Abnett]] were "treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping."<ref>Rogers,Vaneta. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=153225 "Galactus, and Surfer and Skrulls – Oh My! Abnett & Lanning on Nova"], ''[[Newsarama]]'', 10 April 2008 [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9cJPcN1 WebCitation archive].</ref> Galactus also appeared in the limited series ''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1–3 (June–August 2009), a sequel to ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill''.

===2010s===
Galactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in ''[[Skaar]]: Son of Hulk'' #9-11, and as protagonists in the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' (June–November 2010). Galactus was a member of the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]] in the miniseries ''[[Chaos War]]'' #2–5 (December–March 2010) After an appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #583–587 (November 2010&nbsp;– March 2011), the character returned to Earth in ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 6, #1–5 (January–May 2011) and was the antagonist in ''The Mighty Thor'' #1–6 (April–September 2011).

==Fictional character biography==
Galactus was originally the explorer Galan from the planet Taa, which existed in the [[Cyclic model|pre-Big Bang universe]]. When a cataclysm gradually kills all other life in his universe, he and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the [[Big Crunch]]. Galan does not die, however; he is transformed by bonding with the [[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]. He gestates for billions of years in the universe which formed after the [[Big Bang]], emerging as Galactus. A [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] (Ecce) sees Galactus's birth; although he recognizes his destructive nature, he chooses not to kill him.<ref name="origin">''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983).

He later becomes involved in a civil war among the Proemial Gods, who came into being during the universe's infancy as caretakers of the cosmic balance. After a faction of the gods (led by Diableri of Chaos) tries to remake the universe in their image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons two other rebel gods ([[Tenebrous (Marvel Comics)|Tenebrous]] and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]]) in the [[Kyln]].<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (2007)</ref>

The heroes succeed, and the newly empowered Terrax leads his master to Earth. Galactus finds the Sphinx in [[Egypt]], defeats him and retreats when Mr. Fantastic threatens to use a fake [[Ultimate Nullifier]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206–213 (May–December 1979). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later believing that Terrax was trapped in a black hole, Galactus summoned the mutant known as [[Dazzler]] and empowered her to cosmic scale and temporarily made her into his herald, as he thought that Dazzler was one of the few beings in the universe that stood a chance of shedding light on the inside of that space phenomenon.<ref>''Dazzler'' #10</ref> Yet, once inside the hole, Dazzler found that Terrax was not trapped, but was actually hiding from his master. A fight started and, as Dazzler was still empowered by sound blasts that Galactus's ship kept firing inside the black hole, she was able to render Terrax unconscious. She returned the herald to his master and Galactus then went on with his usual business, forgetting the Earth mutant. Only by glowing incredibly bright did she make her presence known and Galactus finally returned her back to Earth.<ref>''Dazzler'' #11</ref>

==={{anchor|DC Crossovers}}DC crossovers===
Galactus has appeared in three [[DC Comics]] crossover stories: ''[[Darkseid]]/Galactus: The Hunger'', ''[[Superman]]/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'' and ''[[JLA/Avengers]]''. In ''The Hunger'' he tries to consume [[Apokolips]], home of the evil [[New Gods]], but stops when he realizes that the planet is lifeless.<ref>''Darkseid/Galactus: The Hunger'' #1.

The plan fails when Galactus chooses Superman instead, but Superman's strong will and the scale of influence that the destruction of Krypton has had on his development allows Superman to resist Galactus's conditioning. At the conclusion of the story, Superman and Reed Richards reprogram Galactus's equipment to drain energy from him instead of planets, ordering him to only feed on lifeless worlds in future. With the Cyborg's deception exposed, Galactus turns the Cyborg into a metal block in response to his pleas for perfection.<ref>''Superman/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'' #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.</ref>

He plays a key role in ''JLA/Avengers'' when [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] comes to the Marvel Universe for knowledge about the creation of the cosmos. The [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] tries to prevent Krona from destroying the Marvel Universe by revealing the existence of Galactus (a being who lived through the Big Bang, and can tell Krona what came before) and offering to play a game with Krona for the being's identity.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics/DC Comics.</ref> As a result, the Justice League and the Avengers are manipulated into competing against each other to acquire twelve items of power from their respective universes, but although the League - serving as the Grandmaster's team - wins the conflict, Krona kills Galactus and the Grandmaster to obtain the knowledge he seeks<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref> (nearly destroying both universes despite the Grandmaster using the assembled items to briefly trap Krona)<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #3.

Marvel Comics/DC Comics.</ref>

===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe combining Marvel and DC characters, Galactus is combined with DC's [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] to create Galactiac. He consumes the life force of planets to recharge his energy (leaving a small part of the planet to study),<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/galctiac.htm|Galactiac}}</ref> and encounters the Challengers of the Fantastic when he comes to Earth.<ref>''Challengers of the Fantastic'' #1 (June 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Golden Oldie===
Spider-Man's Aunt, May Parker, was transformed by Galactus into the cosmically-powered being Golden Oldie to serve as his herald. Rather than lead him to populated worlds, Oldie discovered an extraterrestrial baker who bakes planet-sized snack cakes that sate Galactus's hunger. May's transformation is revealed as a dream. The issue of "Marvel Team-Up", a parody of an old Hostess snack cake advertising campaign, was part of Marvel's "Assistant Editors Month" series of humorous issues.<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #137.

===''Wha... Huh?''===

==In other media==

===Television===
* Galactus appeared in the 1967 ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "Galactus", voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].

* Galactus appeared in the 1994 ''Fantastic Four'' two-part episode "Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus", voiced by [[Tony Jay]]. In the two-part episode "Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus," he arrives on Earth to prepare it for his consumption. Uatu tries to reason with him but to no avail. When Alicia Masters gets Silver Surfer to turn on Galactus, the Human Torch returns with the Ultimate Nullifier in his hands. Knowing that the Fantastic Four would use it against him, he spares the Earth and reclaims the Ultimate Nullifier. He then banishes Silver Surfer to Earth and places a barrier that prevents him from leaving. In the episode "Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus," Doctor Doom steals Silver Surfer's powers and plots to steal Galactus's powers next. When Galactus arrived upon finding out about what happened to Silver Surfer's powers, he stopped Doctor Doom from stealing his powers. Afterwards, he returned Silver Surfer to his exile. In the episode "To Battle the Living Planet," the Fantastic Four had to ask for Galactus's help in order to fight Ego the Living Planet. In the episode "When Calls Galactus," Terrax tricks Galactus into consuming a poisonous planet making him weak and tries to get the Fantastic Four into fighting him. This fails and Galactus devolves Terrax. Due to him being weak, he had no choice but to prepare Earth for his consumption again. Luckily, Nova ended up volunteering to become his next Herald which Galactus agrees to. Upon being empowered by Galactus, she leads him to a recommended section of space where there are non-inhabited planets for him to consume.

* Galactus appeared regularly in the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[James Blendick]]. Unlike the rest of the characters (who were animated), Galactus was computer-generated.{{episode|date=March 2013}} Galactus has arrived at Zenn-La to consume it. Norrin Radd sacrifices himself by offering to serve as Galactus's herald, whose job it will be to scout out planets without intelligent life so that Galactus won't destroy any civilizations. On the upside, Galactus gives Norrin a portion of his powers, turning him into the Silver Surfer. On the downside, the transference of powers remove Norrin's memories and his moral convictions! With no memories, the Silver Surfer finds world after world for Galactus to devour, but the Herald is troubled by the destruction. When it comes to Earth, Silver Surfer turns against Galactus after his memory was restored by Thanos and Ego the Living Planet. Galactus allows Silver Surfer to leave, but Silver Surfer discovers that Zenn-La was moved to another galaxy. In the episode "Antibody," Galactus is dying and Silver Surfer is called in to help cure Galactus in exchange that he tells him where Zenn-La is positioned. Afterwards, Silver Surfer learns that Galactus knows nothing about Zenn-La's location because in his anger, he hurled the planet so far away, even he doesn't knows where it came to rest. If there had been a Season Two, an episode called "Down to Earth" would depict Galactus's second attempt to devour Earth.

* Galactus appeared in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Last Exit Before Doomsday", voiced by [[George Takei]]. After capturing Stardust, Doctor Doom has her lead him to Galactus. Doctor Doom strikes a deal with Galactus that in exchange for some of the Power Cosmic to help him find the Infinity Fractals, he will let Galactus eat the Earth. Galactus wasn't impressed with the deal and blasted Doctor Doom back to Earth. The approaching of Galactus caused everyone in Super Hero City to build a Helicarrier large enough to carry the inhabitants of Earth. When Galactus arrived on the moon and asks why it took so long to ready the Earth for consumption, the Heralds point at Silver Surfer. In the episode "This Al Dente Earth," Iron Man makes some jokes about Galactus causing him to attack Iron Man. When the Heralds are convinced not to let Galactus eat Earth and attack him, Galactus ends up teleporting his Heralds far away from Earth. He then arrives on Earth and reconstructs the large Helicarrier into the Destructo-Pump (a food processing-like device that will enable him to consume the Earth). While Iron Man and Mister Fantastic retrieve the Infinity Fractals that Doctor Doom has and reforge the Infinity Sword, the Super Hero Squad and other heroes of Super Hero City fight to prevent Galactus from consuming the Earth. Most of the superheroes ended up defeated and/or injured fighting him. The remaining superheroes received help from some of the Lethal Legion who tried to fight him and/or destroy his Destructo-Pump. When Iron Man and Mister Fantastic reforged the Infinity Sword, they tried to use it on Galactus and couldn't harm him even when Doctor Doom used it on him. After telling them that the Infinity Sword will only work for someone who wields The Infinity Gauntlet, Silver Surfer managed to convince Galactus to spare Earth and offer to become his Herald again in order to find planets with non-intelligent life on them. Galactus agrees and departs with Silver Surfer and the Infinity Sword. In the episode "Alienating with the Surfer," the Super Hero Squad come to the aid of the Skrull Homeworld when Galactus targets it for consumption and that Ronan the Accuser never showed up (thanks to Silver Surfer). The Super Hero Squad managed to hold off Galactus using food-shaped planets until Silver Surfer arrived and directed Galactus to a section of planets of non-intelligent life. In the episode "Fate of Destiny," Silver Surfer becomes Dark Surfer and uses the Infinity Sword and Infinity Gauntlet to erase the section of the universe where Galactus was.

* The character was featured in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. He first appeared in the episode "Prisoner of War" in a flashback, where a [[Skrull]] explained that Galactus has devoured their homeworld, so they are conquering Earth as a replacement. Galactus then appeared in the series finale, "Avengers Assemble", where he has come to devour Earth as well. He and his heralds fight against the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and other heroes, but ends up getting banished to the [[Negative Zone]], where he can feed on its infinite anti-matter for eternity.

* Galactus made humorous cameo appearances in [[Spider-Man]]'s cutaway comments in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episodes "Back in Black" and "Beetle Mania".

* Galactus appeared in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Galactus Goes Green",<ref>[http://www.toonzone.net/2013/07/marvels-avengers-assemble-assembly-required-comes-dvd-october-8-2013/#.UhJZ4OCUGYd PR: “Marvel’s Avengers Assemble: Assembly Required” Comes to DVD on October 8, 2013]</ref> voiced by [[John DiMaggio]], reprising his role from ''Lego Marvel Super Heroes''. Galactus arrives on Earth where he lands on Las Vegas in order to consume Earth. After Terrax was defeated, Galactus revoked his Power Cosmic and transformed She-Hulk into the Emerald Emissary with it. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. had to fight Galactus to keep him from consuming Earth. Following She-Hulk taking a dive in her fight against Terrax, Galactus returned the Power Cosmic to Terrax who takes Galactus to an uninhabited planet as part of the deal that She-Hulk made with Terrax. In the two-part episode "Planet Hulk," Ronan the Accuser and the Kree use Ego the Living Planet to be a sacrifice to Galactus. During this time, Galactus is shown to have Firelord as his new herald where Firelord claimed that Terrax failed him. Hulk had to work with Ego's inner-ego to keep Galactus from consuming Ego the Living Planet. After Hulk and Ego the Living Planet defeat Galactus, Firelord leads Galactus away to find an uninhabited planet for Galactus to consume.

* John DiMaggio reprises his role as Galactus in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "Guardians and Spaceknights". When Galactus arrives to consume Earth, Iron Man ends up having to speak with him which results in both of them teleporting away. The Avengers track Iron Man to the planet where the [[D'Bari]] live and witness their ships in the middle an evacuation after Iron Man (who was empowered by the Power Cosmic) led Galactus here. The Avengers had to work with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to keep Galactus from consuming Earth. It later turns out that the planet that Galactus was consuming was becoming unstable before Galactus arrived. Galactus found himself unable to stop the process as the Power Cosmic-empowered Iron Man quotes "Galactus must feed." After the planet exploded, Galactus was knocked out cold, the D'Bari settled on another planet, and Iron Man returned to normal.
