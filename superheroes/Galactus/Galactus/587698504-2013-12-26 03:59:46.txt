===Origin===
{{Main|The Galactus Trilogy}}
In 1966, nearly five years after launching [[Marvel Comics]]' flagship [[superhero]] title, ''Fantastic Four'', creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break from the archetypal mold of [[supervillain]]s of the time, and be instead a being of god-like stature and power.<ref name=kirbycollector1>Hatfield, Charles. "The Galactus Trilogy: An Appreciation", ''The Collected Jack Kirby Collector'', February 2004, p. 211</ref> As Lee recalled in 1993,
{{cquote|Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. Having dreamed up [many] powerful baddies ... we felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of demi-god, but now what would we do with him. We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. ... That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god would be beyond mere good and evil. ... [What] he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!<ref>Lee, Stan. "Introduction" (second page, unnumbered) 1993, ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 5''<!--as spelled in copyright indicia--> (Marvel Publishing : second edition, second printing, 2007) ISBN 978-0-7851-1184-9</ref>}}
<!--Wiki MOS is to use blockquotes for quotes four lines or longer-->
Kirby described his Biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee dubbed the [[Silver Surfer]]:
{{cquote|My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales. And I had to come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. ...I had to get something new. And ... for some reason, I went to the Bible. And I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well, because I always felt him, and I certainly couldn't treat him the same way that I would any ordinary mortal ... and of course the Silver Surfer is the fallen angel. ...[T]hey were figures that have never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures, and of course, they were the first gods.<ref>{{cite video

Kirby further explained, "Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way."<ref>Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert.

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanation, stating, "In five short years from the launch of the ''Fantastic Four'', the Lee/Kirby duo...had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives...there were the [[Skrull]]s, the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

All this led to the introduction of Galactus in ''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March–May 1966), which fans began calling "[[The Galactus Trilogy]]".<ref name="TR"/><ref name=kirbycollector1/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fein |first=Eric |title=The Creation of the Fantastic Four |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2006 |pages=48}}</ref><ref>[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]].

===1960s===
Galactus returned for a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #134 (November 1966), although the plot-line was left unresolved as Kirby put the character on hiatus.<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> Galactus reappeared in a flashback cameo in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #37 (February 1968) and then featured heavily in ''Fantastic Four'' #72–77 (March–August 1968) at the request of Lee.<ref name="kirbycollector2"/> After a flashback appearance in ''Silver Surfer'' #1 (August 1968), the character returned to Earth in ''Thor'' #160–162 (January–March 1969), which resolved the plot-line from issue #134. Galactus' origin was revealed in ''Thor '' #168–169 (September–October 1969).

===1970s and 1980s===
The character made appearances in ''Fantastic Four'' #120–123 (March–June 1972) and ''Thor'' #225–228 (July–October 1974). These two storylines introduced two new heralds for Galactus. Galactus also featured in ''Fantastic Four'' #172–175 (July–October 1976) and #206–213 (May–December 1979).

[[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] reunited to depict the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one shot [[graphic novel]] ''The Silver Surfer, The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!'' in 1978. This [[Marvel Fireside Books|Marvel Fireside Book]] published by [[Simon & Schuster]] was an out of continuity re-telling of the origin story, with no appearance of the Fantastic Four.
	
The full in-depth Lee and Kirby origin story was reprinted in one volume in ''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983), inked by [[Vince Colletta]] and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]], lettered by [[Jack Morelli|John Morelli]], and colored by [[Andy Yanchus]]. While mostly identical to the previous origin, the story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], and inker [[Jack Abel]]. Most specifically, rather than journeying into a dying star, the character enters [[World egg#Influences on science fiction and popular culture|the core of the collapsing universe]] prior to the "[[Big Bang]]". The story was later reprinted as ''Origin of Galactus'' #1 (February 1996).

The character guest-starred in ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #26–27 (January–February 1982). Galactus featured heavily in two related storylines in ''Fantastic Four'' #242–244 (May–July 1982) and #257 (August 1983). Another appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #262 (January 1984) attracted controversy. During the conclusion of the story, the character [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the living sentience of the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus, which [[Howard University]] Professor of Literature Marc Singer criticized, stating writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] used the character as a means to "justify planetary-scale genocide."<ref>Singer, Marc.

[http://www.webcitation.org/5v9XIKXrX WebCitation archive].</ref>

Writer-penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced "The Last Galactus Story" as a serial in the [[anthology]] comics-magazine ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' #26–34 (October 1984 – February 1986). Nine of a scheduled 10 installments appeared. Each ran six pages, except part eight, which ran 12. The magazine was canceled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished. Byrne later revealed the conclusion on his website.<ref name="byrnerobotics.com">[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]], [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=3&T1=Questions+about+Aborted+Storylines#57 "Exception to the rule #1: 'The Last Galactus Story'"], "Frequently Asked Questions – Questions about Aborted Storylines", Byrne Robotics, 15 February 2005.

Galactus played a pivotal role in the [[limited series]] ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985), and became a recurring character in the third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'', commencing with issue #1 (July 1987).

===1990s===
Galactus was featured in the miniseries ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1–6 (July–December 1991), ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1–6 (June–November 1992) and ''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (March–August 1994).

The character starred in the six-issue miniseries ''Galactus the Devourer'' (September 1999 – March 2000), written by [[Louise Simonson]] and illustrated by [[John Buscema]], which climaxed with Galactus' death. Simonson had originally conceived of the [[story arc]] to take place in third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'', but the title was canceled due to dwindling sales. Simonson instead proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she believed to be a "radical" idea concerning "why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus."<ref>[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/galactus/interview1.html "Questions & Answers With Writer Louise Simonson: Part 1: In The Beginning..."], Galactus: The Devourer (fan site), n.d. Retrieved 14 April 2008. [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9bxLffx WebCitation archive].</ref>

===2000s===
The consequences of Galactus' death are explored in ''Fantastic Four'' Annual 2001 and ''Fantastic Four'' #46–49 (October 2001 – January 2002), resulting in Galactus' revival.

Galactus features prominently in the first six issues of the series ''[[Thanos]]'' (December 2003 – May 2004), written by [[Jim Starlin]]. The story is noteworthy due to a running theme of highly critical evaluation of the standard justifications ([[Social Darwinism]] and [[divine right of kings]]) for the character, by defending the need for a "[[social contract]]" with the rest of the universe, and to actively seek alternate means to feed his hunger. Issues #7–12, written by [[Keith Giffen]] also introduce the first herald, the Fallen One.

Galactus' origin is re-examined in ''Fantastic Four'' #520–523 (October 2004 – April 2005), wherein the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form.

After appearing in the limited series ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1–6 (March–August 2005), Galactus was featured as a central character in the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" storyline, appearing in the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' #1–4 (June–September 2006), ''Annihilation'' #1–6 (October 2006 – March 2007), and the [[epilogue]], ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus]]'' #1–2 (February–April 2007).

Galactus was an antagonist in ''Fantastic Four'' #545–546 (June–July 2007), when he sought to devour the fellow cosmic function [[List of Marvel Comics characters: E#Epoch|Epoch]].

In ''[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'' vol. 4, #13–15 (May–July 2008), the character had no dialogue during the entire story. The author [[Andy Lanning]] stated that he and co-writer [[Dan Abnett]] were "treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping."<ref>Rogers,Vaneta. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=153225 "Galactus, and Surfer and Skrulls – Oh My! Abnett & Lanning on Nova"], ''[[Newsarama]]'', 10 April 2008 [http://www.webcitation.org/5v9cJPcN1 WebCitation archive].</ref>

The character also appeared in the limited series ''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1–3 (June–August 2009), a sequel to ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill''.

===2010s===
Galactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in ''[[Skaar]]: Son of Hulk'' #9-11 and as protagonists in the limited series ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' (June–November 2010). Galactus was a member of the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]] in the miniseries ''[[Chaos War]]'' #2–5 (December–March 2010)

After an appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #583–587 (November 2010 – March 2011), Galactus returned to Earth in ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 6, #1–5 (January–May 2011) and was the antagonist in ''The Mighty Thor'' #1–6 (April–September 2011).

==Fictional character biography==
Galactus was originally the explorer Galan from the planet Taa, which existed in the [[Cyclic model|pre-Big Bang universe]]. When an impending cataclysm gradually kills all other life in his universe, he and other survivors leave Taa via a space vessel, eventually becoming engulfed in the [[Big Crunch]]. However, Galan does not die, but is transformed through a bonding with the [[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]. He gestates for billions of years in the next universe that formed after the [[Big Bang]], emerging as Galactus. A [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] ("Ecce") observes the birth of Galactus and realizes his fledging destructive nature, but chooses not to take the opportunity to kill him.<ref name="origin">''Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin'' #1 (May 1983)</ref><ref>''Thor'' vol. 1 #168–169</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #522</ref> Once fully aware, Galactus experiences hunger so strongly that he consumes the nearby planet of Archeopia. The planet ultimately becomes the first<ref name="origin"/> of many, as Galactus must consume their life energies for sustenance.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #48</ref> In memory of both his dead homeworld of Taa and for the first planet to fall prey to his hunger, Galactus constructs his new "homeworld", Taa II.

Later on, Galactus becomes involved in a civil war amongst the "Proemial Gods", who came into being during the universe's infancy as caretakers of cosmic balance. After a faction of the gods led by Diableri of Chaos attempts to remake the universe in their image, Galactus slays Diableri and imprisons two other rebel gods, [[Tenebrous (Marvel Comics)|Tenebrous]] and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]], in the [[Kyln]].<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (2007)</ref>

Galactus is later compelled to create a being in his own image, named [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]].<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #6 (August 1994)</ref> Tyrant rebels, and after a terrible battle they part ways. Eventually, Galactus decides to empower others as a Herald to locate worlds for him.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 1 #1</ref> Galactus makes his first herald, the [[Fallen One]], but is unhappy with him, and dismisses him.<ref>''Thanos'' #11–12</ref> He later recruits Norrin Radd as the [[Silver Surfer]].

An undetermined amount of time afterwards, Galactus makes his way to Earth, but is defeated by the efforts of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Uatu]] the Watcher, and a rebellious Silver Surfer. Galactus leaves Earth, vowing that he will never try to consume it again. As he leaves, he relegates the Silver Surfer to Earth for betraying him.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March–May 1966)</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-50/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 50 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=19 February 2010|accessdate=29 September 2010}}.

Galactus later returns seeking his former Herald, but the Surfer is unrepentant and chooses to remain on Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #72–77 (March–August 1968)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] encounters Galactus when the entity comes into conflict with [[Ego the Living Planet]],<ref>''Thor'' #160–162 (January–March 1969)</ref> and eventually discovers Galactus' origin.

Once more returning to Earth, Galactus again seeks to re-enlist the Silver Surfer. However, the Fantastic Four and the Surfer defeat Galactus' herald, [[Air-Walker]], and Mr. Fantastic reprograms Galactus's ship to journey to the [[Negative Zone]], stated to contain an abundance of uninhabited worlds to consume.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #120–123 (March–June 1972)</ref> Thor and [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]] ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] encounter Galactus when his next herald, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]], travels to Earth seeking to be free of his master.

Conflict with the [[High Evolutionary]] occurs when Galactus attempts to devour [[Counter-Earth (comics)#The High Evolutionary Counter-Earth|Counter-Earth]]. The encounter ends with Galactus being transformed into harmless energy after attempting to devour the planet [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#P|Poppup]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #172–175 (July–October 1976)</ref> Galactus eventually reintegrates into his normal form, and is sought out by the Fantastic Four, who seek a way to stop a new cosmic threat, the [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Anath-Na Mut|Sphinx]]. Mister Fantastic offers to release Galactus from the latter's vow of avoiding Earth if he helps defeat the Sphinx. Galactus agrees, but under the condition the Fantastic Four recruit [[Terrax]] as a new Herald. The heroes are successful, and the newly empowered Terrax leads his new master to Earth. Galactus locates the Sphinx in [[Egypt]] and defeats the villain, then decides to retreat when Mister Fantastic threatens to use a fake [[Ultimate Nullifier]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206–213 (May–December 1979)</ref>

Galactus is tricked by the [[Spaceknights#Galador's Spaceknights|Galadorian]] Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] into attempting to devour the "Black Nebula", the home of the [[Dire Wraith]]s. The devourer is repelled by the magic "Wraith Sun";<ref>''Rom'' #26–27 (January–February 1984)</ref> and although weakened, pursues a rebellious Terrax to Earth and strips his herald of all power. Drained of energy, Galactus is saved by the combined efforts of the Fantastic Four and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and acquires another herald, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #242–244 (May–July 1982)</ref>

Later, Galactus destroys the [[Skrull]] homeworld and discusses his role in the universe with fellow cosmic entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #257 (August 1983)</ref> When Mister Fantastic is captured due to his role in saving Galactus' life, he is placed on trial by a united group of aliens who are remnants of races which have been annihilated by Galactus' hunger. During the trial, the cosmic entity [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]—the sentience of the Marvel Universe—intervenes, allowing all present to momentarily become one with the universe. This permits them to understand that Galactus is a vital part of cosmic order, despite the continued loss of entire races. Following the encounter, none present can remember exactly why Galactus is necessary, but the feeling of revelation remains.<ref name="ff262"/>

During the [[Secret Wars]], Galactus tries to consume Battleworld with the intention of having his insatiable hunger taken away by the [[Beyonder]] but his plan is foiled by Dr. Doom.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1–12 (May 1984 – April 1985)</ref> Afterwards, Galactus grants clemency to the Surfer, who aids his former master against the [[Elders of the Universe]]<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1–10 (July 1987 – April 1988)</ref> and the schemes of the [[In-Betweener]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #16–17 (October–November 1988)</ref> Galactus aids the cosmic hierarchy in a war against the mutant [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] [[Thanos]], who possessed the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 – 6 (July–December 1991)</ref>

When Nova is plagued by conscience at causing the deaths of billions of alien beings, Galactus takes on a new Herald, the bloodthirsty [[Morg]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #70 (September 1992)</ref> Tyrant returns, and despite capturing the Surfer, Morg and several other cosmic-powered aliens, is thwarted by [[Thanos]],<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (March–August 1994)</ref> and finally destroyed when Morg uses the Ultimate Nullifier.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #109 (October 1995)</ref>

Galactus eventually decides, with the aid of new Herald [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]], to only devour the energies of living beings. This brings him into conflict with Earth's heroes and other united alien races. During a final confrontation near the homeworld of the [[Shi'ar]], the Silver Surfer turns Galactus' own siphoning-machines on him. A starving Galactus dies, with his remains taking the form of a star.<ref>''Galactus the Devourer'' #1 – 6 (September 1999 – March 2000)</ref>

The death of Galactus allows the entity [[List of Marvel Comics characters: A|Abraxas]] – a metaphysical embodiment of destruction and antithesis of cosmic entity Eternity – to emerge from his imprisonment.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual 2001</ref> Abraxas wreaks havoc across thousands of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s, killing every incarnation of Galactus that he encounters.

Plagued by his conscience, Galactus attempts to rid himself of his hunger by feeding on the power from the [[Infinity Gems]], but is tricked into releasing a greater predator called the "Hunger", that feeds on entire universes. The creature's access is sealed with the aid of Thanos.<ref>''Thanos'' #1–6 (December 2003 – May 2004)</ref>

When an alien race develops a technology that renders planets invisible to Galactus, he empowers the Human Torch (who has temporarily traded powers with the Invisible Woman) as an unwilling herald to locate these planets.

===Ultimate Marvel===

The plan fails when Galactus chooses Superman instead, only for Superman's will to allow his true personality to take control, subsequently working with Reed Richards to reprogram Galactus' equipment to take energy from him so that they can force Galactus to vow to only feed on lifeless worlds in future, Galactus subsequently turning the Cyborg into a simple metal block in response to his pleas for 'perfection'.<ref>''Superman/Fantastic Four: The Infinite Destruction'' #1</ref> 

Galactus plays a key role in ''JLA/Avengers'' when the powerful [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] comes to the Marvel Universe seeking answers about the creation of the cosmos. The [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] attempts to prevent Krona from destroying the Marvel Universe by revealing the existence of Galactus – a being who has lived through the Big Bang and can thus tell Krona what came before – and offering to play Krona in a game for the being's identity,<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1</ref> but Krona instead kills Galactus and the Grandmaster to get the answers he seeks,<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref> nearly destroying both universes,<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #3</ref> before the two teams can destroy Krona's equipment – Krona having built his base out of Galactus' remains – and allow the universes to be restored to their rightful conditions, including restoring Galactus and the Grandmaster to life.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>
