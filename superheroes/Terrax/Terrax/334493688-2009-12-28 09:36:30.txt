'''Terrax the Tamer''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #211 (Oct. 1979) and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[John Byrne]]. 

==Publication history==
The character first appears as '''Tyros''' in the title ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', and is ruler of the city-state of Lanlak on the planetoid Birj. The [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] selects Tyros as his next [[Herald of Galactus|Herald]], but first wishes for the [[superhero]] team the Fantastic Four to humble him. In return the cosmic entity agrees to travel to Earth to aid the heroes against a new threat, the villain the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]]). Tyros is defeated, and brought before Galactus, who changes the petty tyrant into ''Terrax'', with mastery of the elements of earth.

Terrax travels with Galactus to Earth, and while his new master battles the Sphinx, attacks the Fantastic Four - still resenting the heroes for their role in his transformation. Terrax, however, is tricked and defeated by the [[Human Torch]], and leaves with a victorious Galactus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #210 - 213 (Sep. - Dec. 1979)</ref> In the title ''[[Dazzler]]'' Terrax is revealed to have fled from Galactus, but is defeated by heroine Dazzler.<ref>''Dazzler'' #10 - 11 (Dec. 1981 - Jan. 1982)</ref> Terrax reappears in the title ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'', and after leading Galactus to the planet [[Galador]], battles its champion, Rom, and his fellow [[Spaceknights#Galador's Spaceknights|spaceknights]].<ref>''Rom'' #26 - 27 (Jan. - Feb 1984)</ref> 

Terrax rebels again in the title ''Fantastic Four'', and [[levitate]]s the [[New York City]] suburb of [[Manhattan]] into space, and [[blackmail]]s the Fantastic Four into fighting Galactus. The entity, however, strips Terrax of power and he is almost killed when falling from the [[World Trade Center]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #242 - 243 (May - June 1982)</ref> After being hospitalized, a depowered Tyros is retrieved by master villain [[Doctor Doom]]. Doom restores a portion of the character's former cosmic power in exchange for his help in destroying the Fantastic Four. Tyros, however, is unaware that the power he has received is unstable and will destroy him within twenty-four hours. The character defeats three members of the Fantastic Four and then turns against Doom, almost killing the villain. Tyros is challenged by fellow Herald the [[Silver Surfer]], and during the battle is consumed by his own unstable cosmic power.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #258 - 260 (Sep. - Nov. 1983)</ref> In an ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' annual the character is temporarily [[resurrected]] to become a member of the second [[Legion of the Unliving]] by the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16 (1987)</ref>

The character reforms his physical form as Terrax in the title ''[[New Warriors]]'', and battles the fledgling superhero team. Terrax is defeated when the heroes, deducing that his form is unstable and that constant contact with earth is required, separate him and thereby his form.<ref>''New Warriors'' #1 (Jul. 1990)</ref> Terrax reappears when reformed once again by a rogue scientist attempting to steal his power. The character uses the scientist as a host body and again battles the New Warriors and Fantastic Four. The Silver Surfer intervenes and [[Marooning|maroons]] the character on the deserted planet Pluraris IV.<ref>''New Warriors'' #16 -17 (Oct. - Nov. 1991)</ref> 

Terrax features in the third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'' when asked to join his fellow Heralds against the threat of Galactus' latest Herald, [[Morg]]. After Morg's defeat, Terrax claims the character's [[axe]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #74 - 75 (Nov. - Dec. 1992)</ref> Morg eventually wishes to retrieve his weapon and battles Terrax until both are briefly captured - together with several other extraterrestrial character [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and [[Beta Ray Bill]]) - by the entity [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #79 - 82 vol. 3, (Apr. - Jul 1993)</ref> Terrax guest stars in the limited series ''Cosmic Powers'', in which Tyrant is confronted and thwarted by the Titan [[Thanos]].<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1 - 6 (Mar. - Aug. 1994)</ref>

In the title ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'', Terrax is plucked from continuity by the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to be part of a team called the '''Offenders''' in a bid to thwart the Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' #10 (Apr. 2009)</ref>

Like all Heralds, Terrax possesses superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes and durability; energy projection; [[warp speed]] and is immune to the rigors of space.
