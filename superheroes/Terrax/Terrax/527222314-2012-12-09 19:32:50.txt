==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
The character first appears in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #211 (Oct. 1979) and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
The character first appears as '''Tyros''' in the title ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', and is ruler of the city-state of Lanlak on the planetoid Birj. The [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] selects Tyros as his next [[Herald of Galactus|Herald]], but first wishes for the [[superhero]] team the Fantastic Four to humble him. In return the cosmic entity agrees to travel to Earth to aid the heroes against a new threat, the villain the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]]. Tyros is defeated, and brought before Galactus, who changes the petty tyrant into ''Terrax'', with mastery of the elements of earth.

Terrax travels with Galactus to Earth, and while his new master battles the Sphinx, attacks the Fantastic Four - still resenting the heroes for their role in his transformation. Terrax, however, is tricked and defeated by the [[Human Torch]], and leaves with a victorious Galactus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #210 - 213 (Sep. - Dec. 1979)</ref> In the title ''[[Dazzler]]'' Terrax is revealed to have fled from Galactus, but is defeated by the heroine Dazzler.<ref>''Dazzler'' #10 - 11 (Dec. 1981 - Jan. 1982)</ref> Terrax reappears in the title ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'', and after leading Galactus to the planet [[Galador]], battles its champion, Rom, and his fellow [[Terminator (Marvel Comics)|spaceknights]].<ref>''Rom'' #26 - 27 (Jan. - Feb 1984)</ref> 

Terrax rebels again in the title ''Fantastic Four'', and [[levitate]]s the [[New York City]] borough of [[Manhattan]] into space, then [[blackmail]]s the Fantastic Four into fighting Galactus. The entity, however, strips Terrax of power and he is almost killed when falling from the [[World Trade Center]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #242 - 243 (May - June 1982)</ref> After being hospitalized, a depowered Tyros is retrieved by master villain [[Doctor Doom]]. Doom restores a portion of the character's former cosmic power in exchange for his help in destroying the Fantastic Four. Tyros, however, is unaware that the power he has received is unstable and will destroy him within twenty-four hours. Terrax defeats three members of the Fantastic Four and then turns against Doom, almost killing the villain. Terrax is then challenged by fellow Herald the [[Silver Surfer]], and during the battle is consumed by his own unstable cosmic power.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #258 - 260 (Sep. - Nov. 1983)</ref> In an ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' annual the character is temporarily [[resurrection|resurrected]] to become a member of the second [[Legion of the Unliving]] by the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16 (1987)</ref>

Tyros reforms his physical form as Terrax in the title ''[[New Warriors]]'', and battles the fledgling superhero team. Terrax is defeated when the heroes, deducing that his form is unstable and that constant contact with earth is required, separate him and thereby his form.<ref>''New Warriors'' #1 (Jul. 1990)</ref> Terrax reappears when reformed once again by a rogue scientist attempting to steal his power. He uses the scientist as a host body and again battles the New Warriors and Fantastic Four. The Silver Surfer intervenes and [[Marooning|maroons]] Terrax on the deserted planet Pluraris IV.<ref>''New Warriors'' #16 -17 (Oct. - Nov. 1991)</ref> 

Terrax features in the third volume of the ''Silver Surfer'' when asked to join his fellow Heralds against the threat of Galactus' latest Herald, [[Morg]]. After Morg's defeat, Terrax claims the character's [[axe]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #74 - 75 (Nov. - Dec. 1992)</ref> Morg eventually wishes to retrieve his weapon and battles Terrax until both are briefly captured - together with several other extraterrestrial characters [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and [[Beta Ray Bill]] - by the entity [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #79 - 82 vol. 3, (Apr. - Jul 1993)</ref> Terrax guest stars in the limited series ''Cosmic Powers'', in which Tyrant is confronted and thwarted by the Titan [[Thanos]].<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1 - 6 (Mar. - Aug. 1994)</ref>

After a battle with fellow Heralds the Surfer and [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]] (actually the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in disguise) in the title ''Silver Surfer'',<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #97 (Oct. 1994)</ref> the character goes into hiding until he featured in the second ''[[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]'' limited series.<ref>''Sentry'' vol. 2, #1 (Nov. 2005)</ref> Terrax appears in the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' storyline, being initially captured by the forces of [[Annihilus]] before escaping with the [[Extraterrestrial life|Alien]] [[Skrull]] [[Paibok]].<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1 - 4 (June - Sep. 2006)</ref> Terrax later finds a world ruled by the Space Parasite, whom he eventually kills. On discovering that the inhabitants are content to live in subservience, he flies into a rage and destroys the planet.<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #1 (Apr. - May 2007)</ref>

In the title ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'', Terrax is plucked from continuity by the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to be part of a team called the '''Offenders''' in a bid to thwart the Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' #10 (Apr. 2009)</ref>

Terrax later returns to his birth planet Birj where he's approached by one member of the Nova Corps, who had come to give a warning to Terrax and is helping in the evacuation of the planet. Terrax briefly fights him and refuses to evacuate the planet. Nova runs away as the threat he warned Terrax about arrives. As Nova leaves the planet, he sees the Phoenix Force completely destroy the Planet Birj on its way through the universe, taking Terrax and all its population with it.<ref>''Marvel Point One''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tyros is an alien with a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|genetic mutation]] that gives him a limited mental ability to manipulate the molecules of rock and earth. After being transformed by the cosmic power of Galactus, the character can perform feats as fine as manipulating sand and as grand as causing volcanic eruptions and moving [[asteroid]]s; [[meteor]]s, and planetary masses from space at high speeds; shift tectonic plates to cause [[earthquake]]s and create chasms, and levitate large land masses miles into the air. Like all Heralds, Terrax possesses superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes and durability; energy projection; force fields; [[warp speed]] and is immune to the rigors of space. The character further possesses a cosmic [[scythe]] which he sometimes directs his energy attacks through.
