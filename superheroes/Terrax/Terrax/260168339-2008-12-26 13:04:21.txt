==Fictional character biography==
'''Tyros''' was originally ruler of the city-state of Lanlak on the planetoid Birj, a satellite of the gas giant Marman. A ruthless despot, Tyros is noticed by the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]], who decides that the weakness in his former [[Herald of Galactus|Heralds]] had been their compassion.  When the [[Fantastic Four]] find Galactus and ask for his help to stop the entity [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]], Galactus agrees on the condition that they first humble Tyros and prepare him for his new role. The Fantastic Four are successful, and Tyros is taken - against his will - by Galactus and transformed into Terrax the Tamer.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #211 (Oct. 1979)</ref><ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-14653-141-6 | page = 7}}</ref>

Terrax travels with Galactus to Earth to confront the Sphinx, and still resenting the Fantastic Four for their role in his transformation, attacks them. He is, however, tricked and defeated by the [[Human Torch]]. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #213 (Dec. 1979)</ref> Resenting a life of servitude, Terrax later rebels against Galactus and forces the Fantastic Four to battle Galactus. In this encounter Terrax is stripped of his power by Galactus and almost killed, <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #242 (May 1982)</ref> but after being hospitalized is retrieved by master villain [[Doctor Doom]]. Doom then restores some of Terrax's former power in exchange for his help in destroying the Fantastic Four.  Unknown to Terrax, the power he has received is unstable and will destroy him within twenty-four hours. Terrax defeats three members of the Fantastic Four before being challenged by the [[Silver Surfer]], and is consumed by his own power in the battle. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #258 - 260 (Sep. - Nov. 1983)</ref>

Years later, Terrax manages to reform his physical body and battles the fledgling superhero team, the [[New Warriors]]. Terrax is defeated when they correctly deduce that his form is unstable and that he needs to be in contact with earth at all times. <ref>''New Warriors'' #1 (Jul. 1990)</ref> Terrax is later reformed when a scientist attempts to steal his power, and after causing massive destruction battles the New Warriors and Fantastic Four. Terrax is finally stopped by the Silver Surfer, who maroons him on a deserted planet. <ref>''New Warriors'' #16 -17 (Oct. - Nov. 1991)</ref> 

Terrax is eventually contacted by the Surfer and his fellow Heralds when they are preparing to confront Galactus' latest Herald, [[Morg]]. Terrax plays a pivotal role in the battle; he takes Morg's axe and departs once Morg is depowered by Galactus. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #74 - 75 (Nov. - Dec. 1992)</ref>  Terrax then battles Morg for the axe, and is captured with Morg and several other extraterrestrials (including [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and [[Beta Ray Bill]]) by the entity [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #79 - 82 vol. 3, (Apr. - Jul 1993)</ref> With the exception of Morg, Terrax and the other beings escape, and he is then recruited by the Titan [[Thanos]] to assist in defeating Tyrant. <ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1 - 6 (Mar. - Aug. 1994)</ref>

After a brief battle with the Surfer and [[Nova (Frankie Raye)]] (actually the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in disguise), <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #97 (Oct. 1994)</ref> Terrax goes into hiding until encountering the hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]. <ref>''Sentry'' #1 (2005)</ref> Terrax is later captured by the forces of [[Annihilus]] as the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] sweeps across the universe, <ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1 - 4 (2006)</ref>  but eventually frees both himself and [[Paibok]] the Power Skrull. The two escape to a planet ruled by a parasitic being. After killing this being, Terrax discovers the inhabitants were content to live in subservience and in a rage he destroys the planet. <ref>''Annihilation:Heralds of Galactus'' #1 (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tyros was born with a limited mental control over rock and earth. After being changed by Galactus into Terrax and endowed with the power cosmic, his powers were significantly increased, to the point whereby he could perform feats such as causing volcanic eruptions and pulling asteroids from space. Like all Heralds, Terrax possesses superhuman strength, reflexes and durability, and is immune to the rigors of space. Terrax also possesses an energy [[scythe]] that allows energy projection and assists with matter manipulation and traveling faster than light.
