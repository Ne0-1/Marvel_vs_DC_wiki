==Fictional character biography==

The Man Beast was once an ordinary wolf,  ,and is captured and mutated by the [[High Evolutionary]] - a being intent on creating an army of [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|New Men]] from animals. While the wolf was mutated by "Isotope C", the High Evolutionary is attacked by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who was attempting to find his mortal love, [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]. The delay is costly, as the wolf is overexposed to the isotope and pushed to physical and mental perfection. The process also instills the creature with an utter hatred of all other forms of life. The High Evolutionary called his creation a "Super Beast" - which promptly escapes and uses the High Evolutionary's equipment created an army of followers that attack its creator's own New Men. The Super Beast is defeated by Thor, with the High Evolutionary then placing the unconscious Super Beast and his defeated army in a rocket. The rocket is then launched into deep space, in the hope that the Super Beast would never be seen again. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #134 - 135</ref>

Unfortunately the creature, now calling itself the Man Beast, lands with its army on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] - a planet located on the other side of the Sun and also created by the High Evolutionary. The Man Beast poses as Counter-Earth's United States President Rex Carpenter.  He and his army begin to corrupt Counter-Earth until the High Evolutionary sends [[Adam Warlock]], who after a lengthy war defeats the Man Beast and his followers. <ref>''Marvel Premiere'' vol. 1, #1 - 2 + ''Power of Warlock'' vol. 1, # 1 - 8</ref> The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] is also present on Counter-Earth at one point and aids Adam Warlock in defeating the Man Beast.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1, #176 - 178</ref> The Man Beast manages to escape Counter-Earth and eventually finds his way to the true Earth, where disguised as the [[Hate-Monger]], he battles [[Spider-Man]]. Caught in an explosion and buried under tons of debris, the Man Beast is almost killed, and takes many years to regenerate. <ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #13 - 15</ref> He eventually re-emerges and allying himself with the [[Bi-Beast]] comes into conflict with Thor once more, this time aided by [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] teammate [[Iron Man]]. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #316 - 317</ref> Defeated again, the Man Beast later discovers the existence of the [[Infinity Gems]] and manages to steal four of the gems from his old foe, Adam Warlock. Warlock eventually stops the Man Beast and is only prevented from killing him by [[Captain America]]. <ref>''Warlock & The Infinity Watch'' vol. 1,  #3 - 6</ref> The Man Beast is finally stopped when the High Evolutionary, with the aid of the mutant hero [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], reverts the creature back into a wolf. <ref>''Quicksilver'' vol. 1, # 1 - 6, 8 - 12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

The Man-Beast was a perfect synthesis of man and wolf. <ref>Thor vol. 1, #134 -135</ref> The creature had superior senses; strength on par with [[Spider-Man]]; incredible speed; durability and fighting skills. Courtesy of his own genius and unlimited hatred, the Man-Beast was also capable of projecting beams of force and erecting force fields strong enough to repel Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The Man-Beast also used other technological aids such as a personal teleportation device.

Despite being insane and fanatically nihilistic, the Man-Beast was remarkably intelligent, and proved a quick study in all known fields of science, constructing weapons and inventions that rivaled those of his creator.
