'''Cosmic Boy''' ('''Rokk Krinn''' of the [[planet]] [[Braal (planet)|Braal]]) is a fictional character, a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the 30th and 31st centuries of the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #247 (April 1958). 

== Character History ==

He is a founding member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], along with [[Lightning Lad]] and [[Saturn Girl]] and he has the [[superhuman]] ability to create magnetic fields.  Cosmic Boy's brother, Pol, eventually joined the Legion as Magnetic Kid, but died during the "Magic Wars".

Cosmic Boy's character has been fairly consistent over the various versions of the Legion. He was the Legion's original leader and is portrayed as such in the current version of the series. He is rather serious and has a strong sense of duty.

In the pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] Legion, Cosmic Boy was romantically involved with [[Night Girl]] (Lydda Jath) from the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]].  During the "Five Year Gap", he lost his powers in the course of the war between the planets of Braal and [[Imsk]] (the homeworld of [[Shrinking Violet]]), in which the Imskian army used a "dampener" on the magnetic fields within the Braalian soldiers.  "Vi" was on the scene when her fellow Legionnaire was crippled by the dampener during the battle of Venado Bay, and harbored deep guilt for years.  Now going by plain old "Rokk Krinn", Rokk retired to the slums of a demilitarized Braal with his wife Lydda, who gave birth to their son "Pol" (named for Rokk's brother).  When [[Chameleon Boy|Reep Daggle]] reformed the Legion, a powerless Rokk joined up, moving his family to the Legion's new headquarters.  The former "Cosmic Boy" continued to serve with honor during the adult Legion's tour of duty, proving that he needed no powers to be a hero.  Rokk did however regain his powers shortly before [[Zero Hour (comics)|''Zero Hour'']], thanks to a special pair of power gauntlets.  He took on the codename "Polestar", only to renounce the power gauntlets after they began to affect his mind.  After learning that he was apparently destined to become [[Time Trapper|the Time Trapper]], Rokk and the rest of the Legion were erased from history by ''Zero Hour''.

Cosmic Boy's original costume was pink with black at the sides, with four white circles, the code-name "Cosmic Boy" written on the chest, and a plastic bubble space helmet. After his first appearance, the helmet and the codename were replaced with white epaulets.   For a period in the late 1970s, he was portrayed in a costume that was essentially a black [[bustier]] with black [[glove]]s and [[boot]]s, with bare arms, shoulders, chest and legs. This costume &ndash; one of several designed by [[Mike Grell]] &ndash; received a mixed reaction from fans, some of whom felt it oversexualized Cosmic Boy, while others saw it as innovative and reflective of the times in which the comic was then being published. Cosmic Boy returned to a close variation on the original costume a few years later.  As Polestar, he wore a black and purple bodysuit with a stripe up the side and a black cowl. In the post-Zero Hour Legion, he wore a version of his original costume with lavender as the primary colour instead of pink. The current version is a similar pattern, with blue as the primary colour and black circles instead of white.

Cosmic Boy is one of the few Legionnaires ever to have his own miniseries, which ran for four issues in the mid-1980s as a spin-off of the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' cross-over.
