'''Cosmic Boy''' (Rokk Krinn of the [[planet]] [[Braal]]) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He has the [[superhuman]] power of generating and controlling [[magnetism]]. He is a founding member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], along with [[Lightning Lad]] and [[Saturn Girl]].  He first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #247 (April 1958).

Cosmic Boy's character has been fairly consistent over the various versions of the Legion. He was the Legion's original leader and is portrayed as such in the current version of the series. He is rather serious and has a strong sense of duty.

In the pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] Legion, he was romantically involved with [[Night Girl]] from the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]]. 

His original costume was pink with black at the sides, with four white circles on his chest and white epaulets. For a period in the late 1970s, he was portrayed in a costume that was essentially a black [[bustier]] with black [[glove]]s and [[boot]]s, with bare arms, shoulders, chest and legs.  This costume—one of several designed by [[Mike Grell]]—was controversial. Many fans felt it oversexualized Cosmic Boy. Several other characters were portrayed in equally revealing costumes, most of which were poorly received by fans. Cosmic Boy returned to a close variation on the original costume a few years later. In the post-Zero Hour Legion he wore a version of his original costume with lavender as the primary colour instead of pink. The current version is a similar pattern, with blue as the primary colour and black circles instead of white.

Cosmic Boy is one of the few Legionnaires ever to have his own title, which ran briefly in the mid-1980s.

==Other Media==
Cosmic Boy appeared in an episode of the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' [[animated series]] with [[Saturn Girl]] and [[Chameleon Boy|Chameleon]]. He was voiced by [[Chad Lowe]].
