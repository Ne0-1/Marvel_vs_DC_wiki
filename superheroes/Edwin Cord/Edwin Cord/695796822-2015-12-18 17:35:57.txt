Head of the Cord Conglomerate, Edwin Cord is a well-connected yet frustrated [[Businessperson|businessman]].

From his palatial estate on the East Coast, he plotted to bring down [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and his companies on a regular basis.

Edwin Cord hired the Raiders to take on Iron Man. He returned with his [[Raiders (comics)|Raiders]] in an attempt to destroy the newly formed Stark Enterprises. After the Raiders were defeated, Edwin Cord shows a film of their exploits to S.H.I.E.L.D. to try and get the weapons contract they formerly offered to Stark.

While in prison, Edwin Cord hires Brendan Doyle to infiltrate Stark Enterprises and steal the Mauler armor in order to destroy the records and histories of the Stark Armor designs. Mauler was thwarted by [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #156</ref>

During the ''[[Armor Wars]]'' storyline, Edwin Cord was released from prison where he, Senator Boynton, and General Meade were overseeing Jack Taggert operating the [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]] armor that Edwin Cord's company created.

Edwin Cord says to Senatort Boynton and General meade that should they try to take it, he will reveal to the tabloids how the armor was conceived as a riot-control device and then has Taggart blow up the flatbed truck they were going to use to take away the armor. They are cowed though Meade is very unhappy. Over the next few days, Edwin Cord and Firepower seem determined to sabotage Stark Enterprises. Edwin Cord and Firepower intimidate a manufacturing group into not accepting a Stark contract bid and blow up a shipment for Acutech Research and Development (a subsidiary of Stark Enterprises). After more days of destruction and harassment, Edwin Cord and Firepower drive Stark Enterprises to the point where Tony says they “can’t afford to lose another account.” Firepower arrives at the Stark Railyard where he injuresing Bill Segrist (who is in charge of the railyard) and gives Tony Stark a message from Cord that says that he destroyed Iron Man and now plans to destroy the rest of Tony Stark’s life.<ref>''Iron Man'' #231</ref>
