'''Edwin Cord''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He was created by [[David Michelinie]], [[Bob Layton]], and [[John Romita, Jr.]], and first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #125 (May 1988). <ref>Iron Man #145</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Head of the Cord Conglomerate, Edwin Cord is a well-connected, if frustrated, businessman. From his palatial estate on the East Coast, he plotted to bring down Stark and his companies on a regular basis. <ref>Iron Man #145-146</ref>

In his debut, he hired The Raiders to take on Iron Man. He returned with his [[Raiders (comics)|Raiders]] in an attempt to destroy the newly formed SE. Later, Cord used [[Firepower (comics)|Project: Firepower]] to go after Tony, ruin his business, and kill Iron Man. Then, Cord reached out from prison to get revenge. With the help of a man on the inside, Cord sent a hit team to kill people at SE. As in prior instances, he was defeated. <ref>Iron Man #226</ref>

Edwin was responsible for the funding of the Raiders and the creation of the heavily armored Firepower, both in plots to destroy Iron Man. This arc became known as [[Armor Wars]]. He is often associated with '''Drexel Cord''' (an unspecified relation, maybe that of a father) and his sister Janice. <ref>Iron Man #229-231</ref>

Edwin Cord would later go on to finance [[U.S. Agent]] and the [[The Jury (comics)|Jury]] in a failed attempt to apprehend the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. <ref>Thunderbolts #23</ref> <ref>Thunderbolts #28</ref>
