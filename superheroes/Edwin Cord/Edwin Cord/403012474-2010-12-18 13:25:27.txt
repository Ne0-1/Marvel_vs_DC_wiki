'''Edwin Cord''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He is created by [[David Michelinie]], [[Bob Layton]], and [[John Romita Junior]] in Iron Man #125 (May 1988).

==Fictional character biography==
Head of the Cord Conglomerate, Edwin Cord is a well-connected, if frustrated, businessman. From his palatial estate on the East Coast, he plotted to bring down Stark and his companies on a regular basis.

In issue, he hired The Raiders to take on Iron Man. He returned in #226 with his Raiders in an attempt to destroy the newly formed SE. Later, Cord used Project Firepower to go after Tony, ruin his business, and kill Iron Man. Then, Cord reached out from prison to get revenge. With the help of a man on the inside, Cord sent a hit team to kill people at SE. As in prior instances, he was defeated.

Edwin was responsible for the funding of the [[Raiders (comics)|Raiders]] and the creation of the heavily armored [[Firepower (comics)|Firepower]], both in plots to destroy Iron Man. This arc became known as [[Armor Wars]]. He is often associated with Drexel Cord (an unspecified relation, maybe that of a father) and his sister Janice.

Edwin Cord would later go on to finance [[U.S. Agent]] and the [[The Jury (comics)|Jury]] in a failed attempt to apprehend the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].
