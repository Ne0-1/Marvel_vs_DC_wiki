'''Death's Head''' is the name of a [[cyborg]] [[bounty hunter]] created by [[Simon Furman]] and artist [[Geoff Senior]] for the [[Marvel UK]] imprint of [[Marvel Comics]]. Originally he was planned to star in his own series, but was shelved. A little later, Furman decided to use Death's Head in his UK [[Transformers (comic)|Transformers]] stories, and so the character was unleashed, first in a one-page strip ("High Noon Tex") that ran in many comics to confirm Marvel's ownership of the character (if he had appeared in the Transformers comics first, [[Hasbro]] would have owned him), and then in the Transformers comic itself.

==Death's Head (original)==
Death's Head's first appearance after ''High Noon Tex,'' was in Marvel's ''[[Transformers (comic)|Transformers]]'' series, which saw him attempt to claim the bounty that [[Rodimus Prime]] had hastily placed on [[Galvatron]]'s head. Learning that Galvaron had travelled back in time, Death's Head transported himself back to [[1987]] in pursuit of his quarry, while Rodimus Prime, realising his error, followed him back, and stopped him from destroying Galvatron, forcibly returning him to the future. Subsequently, Death's Head was contracted by the [[Decepticons]] to take out Rodimus Prime, a piece of business that Death's Head considered a pleasure, only to have the hit interfered with by Decepticons [[Cyclonus]] and [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], hoping to take the glory for themselves. Death's Head was tricked by Rodimus into entering the Autobot base, where, outnumbered, he cut a deal, and was paid by Rodimus to hunt down Cyclonus and Scourge.

Over the course of the next year, Death's Head pursued Cyclonus and Scourge across the galaxy, eventually confronting them on the [[Planet of Junk]], where they all fell under the mental control of the disembodied head of [[Unicron]]. Death's Head tried to resist the control, but was manipulated into killing [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], allowing Cyclonus and Scourge to take command of the Decepticons and re-ignite the stalemated Cybertronian war, which would disguise Unicron's own activities. In his continued battle against Unicron's control, Death's Head confronted him on the astral plane and discovered the true origin of the world-eater, using that knowledge to help Rodimus Prime seal Unicron within the [[Creation Matrix|Matrix]]. As explosion tore the area apart, destroying Unicron's head, Death's Head - vowing to see his contract through to the end - forced himself, Cyclonus and Scourge through Unicron's time portal, vowing to kill them "another time". However, in the course of the time travel they became separated, and while Cyclonus and Scourge wound up on Cybertron in the past, eventually joining with [[Scorponok]] and becoming [[Targetmasters]], Death's Head instead encountered the [[Time Lord]] known as [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]. The Doctor shrank him to human size and shot him off through time, leading him into an encounter with the future government's troubleshooting team, the [[Dragon's Claws]]. 

Subsequently, Death's Head was finally granted a comic book of his own, originally set in the year 8162 but later travelling to the present and then to the year 2020. During this series, Spratt, a young gang member rebuilt Death's Head after he was destroyed by Dragon's Claws, leading to a redesign of Death's Head body, and his becoming the cyborg's unwanted partner. The series was ended abruptly with a cliffhanger at issue 10 due to the closure of [[Marvel UK]]'s own creative team. 

In 1990, the ongoing storyline was resolved in the [[Marvel UK]] graphic novel, ''Death's Head: The Body in Question'', which was serialized in the magazine ''Strip'' before being reprinted in the Marvel Graphic Novel format. In this story, Death's Head's origins were revealed to him for the first time. 

His mechanoid body had originally been constructed to host the life energy of the techno-mage Lupex. However, a woman named Pyra, who wished to steal Lupex's secrets, ultimately decided to use the mechanoid body against him. She gave it a cold and calculating business-like mind, but before it could be used against Lupex, the body was stolen by an unknown party (later revealed to be the Doctor), enlarged to the size of the [[Cybertron]]ians, and catapulted through time.

At this time, 6 issues of the original series were also collected in the graphics novel ''The Life and Times of Death's Head'', together with the ''High Noon Tex'' strip and some words from writer Simon Furman and concept art for the character's original design. The article makes mention of a new limited series entering production, with a new, gothic, redesign of the character. However, this series was never published.

Around this time, Death's Head's increasing 'cult status' meant that he also made a few appearances in some US Marvel comics, most notably the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' (issue 338), ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (Sensational She-Hulk issue 24) and ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' (issue 76).

==Death's Head II==
Eventually, after many undocumented adventures, Death's Head was beheaded and his personality "assimilated" into the mind of the [[cyborg]] Minion. Minion was a [[cyborg]] created by Dr. Evelyn Necker, an employee of [[AIM (comics)|AIM]] in the year [[2020]]. Death's Head's personality overwhelmed Minion's programming, and they became the [[gestalt]] lifeform that called itself Death's Head II. Death's Head II was partnered with Tuck, an [[android|artificial human]] from the pseudo-[[medieval]] planet of Lionheart, where humans had outlawed advanced technology and waged war against androids and cyborgs. Death's Head II encountered many more Marvel characters, including the Fantastic Four, [[X-Men]], [[Spider-Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and crossed over with almost every Marvel UK character who was published at the time.

Death's Head 2 was created by artist [[Liam Sharp]] and primarily scripted by [[Dan Abnett]].

The original Death's Head was only ever seen again in flashbacks or within Death's Head II's [[gestalt]] mind. However, a coda to the original Death's Head could be found in the [[Simon Furman]]-penned issue of ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', issue #54 which was entitled "What If Death's Head I Had Lived?"

The original 10 issue series was reprinted, completely this time, in a 12 issue mini series featuring new covers and an additional short story featuring Death's Head 2 replaying his memories.

Death's Head 2 titles included the 4 issue introductory mini series, a 16 issue 'ongoing' run, and Death's Head 2 Gold, a second mini series that only got as far as issue 1 (although issue 0 was features as a flip cover on ongoing issue 15).

Death's Head's exploits ultimately came to end with the (second) demise of Marvel UK's in house creative team, and aside from a cameo in [[Avengers Forever]], he has not been featured in a Marvel comic since.

==Death's Head 3.0==

In August 2005, Death's Head won a [http://www.marvel.com Marvel.com] poll (with 49% of the vote in his favour) to be "remade" in the pages of Marvel's [[anthology]] series ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]''. The five-part "Death's Head" storyline began with #16 (December 2005). The comic is written by creator [[Simon Furman]] and drawn by [[James Raiz]], featuring "Death's Head 3.0", carrying over the continuity from the previous two characters to carry the name.

The story of Death's Head 3.0 is set 100 years in the future. [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (the criminal creators of the Minion cyborg in 2020, but now a benevolent organization) fight a nonviolent battle against a fascist regime ruling the world. When a splinter group from this new AIM breaks off and decides to return to the group's violent roots, Death's Head is forced to decide which side he wants to be on.
