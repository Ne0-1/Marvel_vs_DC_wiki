'''Death's Head''' is a [[fictional character]], a cyborg bounty hunter (or rather, as he calls himself, a "freelance peace-keeping agent") appearing in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Simon Furman]] and artist [[Geoff Senior]] for the company's [[Marvel UK]] imprint. Furman decided to use Death's Head in his [[List of Transformers comic book series|Transformers]] stories, but believed that characters appearing in Transformers "were prone to be absorbed into that title's catchall copyright"<ref name="vol1intro" /> (allowing [[Hasbro]] to contest their ownership) and has stated that this led to a one-page strip ''High Noon Tex'' (which was subsequently published in various Marvel UK titles) being hastily created to establish Marvel's ownership of the character.<ref name="vol1intro" /> 

The character was later redesigned and relaunched as '''Death's Head II''', acting as one of the flagship characters for Marvel UK's 1990s expansion. This version of Death's Head also inspired two spin-off characters, '''[[Death Wreck]]''' and '''[[Death Metal (comics)|Death Metal]]''', each of which starred in its own [[limited series]].  

Later, in 2005, fans used a poll on Marvel's website to vote for the character's return. This led to a third version of Death's Head, '''Death's Head 3.0''', created by original Death's Head writer Simon Furman.

==Publication history==
===Death's Head===
Death's Head was originally created as a "throwaway character" for use in the UK ''[[Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'' comic, a bounty hunter who would feature in a single story-arc and then, according to writer Simon Furman, would "be discarded down the line (probably at the end of the first story arc)"<ref name="vol1intro">Furman, Simon (2006). "Freelance Peacekeeping Agent Open For Business (or how Death's Head came to be)", ''Death's Head Volume 1'', Panini Publishing, ISBN 1-905239-34-3</ref>. 

Geoff Senior then showed Furman the initial character designs, at which point they decided that the character had potential beyond his planned appearance as a "generic, stock mech-with-an-attitude". As a result of this, Simon Furman also rewrote the Transformers scripts to change Death's Head's dialogue in line with the revised character concept.<ref name="vol1intro"/> 

To avoid [[Hasbro]] claiming ownership of the character as a consequence of the ''Transformers'' copyright terms they had agreed with Marvel, Death's Head had to make his debut in another Marvel comic before appearing in ''Transformers'' (this situation had also applied to another Marvel character created for use in ''Transformers'', [[Circuit Breaker (Transformers)|Circuit Breaker]]).<ref name="vol1intro"/> Accordingly, Furman wrote a single-page strip ("High Noon Tex", illustrated by [[Bryan Hitch]]) that was published in a number of Marvel UK titles before Death's Head first appeared in Transformers.

Furman has stated that he chose the name Death's Head for the character while unaware of the "Nazi-connotations of the name".<ref name="vol1intro"/>

After the initial Transformers storyline, the character appeared in Doctor Who Magazine, in a story which saw him reduced from a giant robot to a more human stature. He then made a guest appearance in Marvel UK's first comic in the standard American format, [[Dragon's Claws]], which led into a ten issue series of his own.

After the cancellation of the series, Marvel UK published an origin story for the character, ''The Body in Question'' - initially serialised in the Marvel UK anthology ''Strip'', it was then collected in [[graphic novel]] format.

At this time, six issues of the original series were also collected in the graphic novel ''The Life and Times of Death's Head'', together with the ''High Noon Tex'' strip, some words from writer Simon Furman and some concept art for the character's original design. The article makes mention of a new limited series entering production, with a new, gothic, redesign of the character. However, this series was never published.

===Death's Head II===
After the initial Death's Head stories ceased publication, the character was revamped for inclusion in Marvel UK's next wave of titles. Originally launched as a four-issue limited series, ''Death's Head II'' then became an ongoing series - and also featured in a number of team-up limited series designed to showcase new Marvel UK characters.

The story include Dr [[Evelyn Necker]] who creates Minion. In 2008, the original author [[Dan Abnett]] along with [[Andy Lanning]] (collectively referred to as DnA) used Doctor Necker as a member of [[Project Pegasus]], while writing ''[[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'' during that comic's involvement with Marvel's [[Secret Invasion]] storyline.<ref>''Nova'' #17 (2008)</ref>  In the story, it was mentioned that Necker was working on a project to develop a cyborg called "Minion." DnA said "This is us just having fun- the Death's Head thread has recently been worked back into the [[Marvel Universe]] via ''[[Planet Hulk]]'', and we thought we would tie a few loose ends together."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18215 Quantum Leap: DnA Talk "Nova"], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 25, 2008</ref>

===Death's Head 3.0===
A third version of Death's Head was introduced in 2005, the result of an online poll on the www.marvel.com site<ref name="paniccia">[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=50003 Pniccia on Death's Head 3.0 & Amfan Things to Come], [[Newsarama]], November 21, 2006</ref>. Fans were given the chance to choose between four existing Marvel characters - Death's Head, [[Woodgod]], [[Wundarr the Aquarian|The Aquarian]] and [[Texas Twister]]. The winning character was to be revamped and would then receive their own storyline in Marvel's ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' title. Death's Head won, receiving 49% of the vote.<ref name="paniccia"/>.

Death's Head creator Simon Furman has stated<ref name="furmandh3">[http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=37077 Simon Furman: Transforming Death's Head Into Annihilation], Comixfan, December 21, 2005</ref> that he contacted Marvel as soon as he became aware of the poll. ''Amazing Fantasy'' editor Mark Paniccia had already intended to contact Furman to ask him some questions about the character<ref name="paniccia"/>, and their conversation also led to Furman writing the initial Death's Head 3.0 story.

The initial Death's Head 3.0 story also includes a number of elements which tie it into previous ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' stories - Death's Head sentience and power source comes from AIM's attempts to first capture and then replicate the power that created [[Captain Universe]]. Issue #16 revealed the scientist that began the project was [[Monica Rappaccini]], mother of the [[Carmilla Black|new Scorpion]], on the back of her attempts to capture the Uni-Power in other titles. Varina Goddard is revealed via AIM records to be Monica's granddaughter. (The scene appears to label Monica as Carmilla Black at one point, but Varina refers to the project specifically as "grandmother's research" at the end of the issue.)

While the Minion project is mentioned as the reason for Death's Head being given his name, no other ties to the previous Death's Heads were included. However, Simon Furman has stated that if the character returns he will "work in a little retroactive back story to create a kind of unified Death's Head-verse."<ref name="furmandh3"/> In ''Nova'' #17, DnA showed the Minion project was originally based around a Death's Head "3.0" cyborg. [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QqxEzkl_lrA/SPzAi0bpT_I/AAAAAAAAAes/fbCplGoZS6w/s1600-h/minion1.jpg]

Since the conclusion of the ''Amazing Fantasy'' storyline, other Death's Head cyborgs have appeared in the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]] storyline ''Planet Hulk'', as well as in #5 of ''MODOK's 11''.

===Ultimate Death's Head===
In 2006, Liam Sharp pitched a Death's Head mini-series for Marvel's [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] line; this was passed on. The details are unknown, though the design for Ultimate Death's Head is available online.<ref name=ultimatedh />

==Fictional character biography==
===Death's Head===
Death's Head's first appearance after "High Noon Tex", was in the ''[[Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'', seeing him attempt to claim the bounty that [[Rodimus Prime]] had placed on [[Galvatron]]'s head, travelling back in time to the 1980s in pursuit of his quarry. Realising the error he had made in placing the bounty, Rodimus followed him back, and stopped him from destroying Galvatron, forcibly returning him to the future. Subsequently, Death's Head was contracted by the [[Decepticons]] to take out Rodimus Prime, a piece of business that Death's Head considered a pleasure. However, Rodimus outsmarted him, and instead paid him to terminate [[Cyclonus]] and [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]. Over the course of the next year, Death's Head pursued them, eventually confronting them on the [[Planet of Junk]], where they all fell under the mental control of [[Unicron]]. 

Death's Head tried to resist the control, but was manipulated into killing [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], only to eventually help Rodimus Prime seal Unicron within the [[Creation Matrix|Matrix]]. Finally, prevented from escaping the scene by the explosions wracking the area, Death's Head forced himself, Cyclonus and Scourge through Unicron's time portal, vowing to kill them "another time". However, in the course of the time travel they became separated, and while Cyclonus and Scourge wound up on Cybertron in the past, eventually joining with [[Scorponok]] and becoming [[Targetmasters]], Death's Head instead encountered the [[Time Lord]] known as [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]. As a matter of self-defense, The Doctor shrank him to human size and shot him off through time, leading him into an encounter with the future government's troubleshooting team, [[Dragon's Claws]]<ref name="claws5">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Artist = [[Geoff Senior]] | Story = Death's Head! | Title = [[Dragon's Claws]] | Issue = 5 | Date =  November 1988| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}</ref>. 

Death's Head's was recovered by the Chain Gang and rebuilt (with a redesigned body) by one of their members, Spratt<ref name="dh1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[Mark Farmer]] | Story = Death's Head Revisited | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 1 | Date =  December 1988| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}</ref>. In exchange for this rescue, he confronted Dragon's Claws again on the Chain Gang's behalf, defeating and capturing Scavenger. When the Claws came to recover their missing member, Death's Head defeated Dragon - but opted not to kill him, instead walking away and stating that his chronometer was "a minute slow" and his contract had therefore expired. The Chain Gang were arrested and Spratt, who had escaped arrest, opted to join Death's Head<ref name="dh2">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[Dave Hine]] | Story = Contractual Obligations | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 2 | Date =  January 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}</ref>. 

Death's Head and Spratt then relocated to the Los Angeles Resettlement, where Death's Head once again went into business as a Freelance Peacekeeping Agent<ref name="dh3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Furman]] | Penciller = [[Bryan Hitch]] | Inker = [[Dave Hine]] | Story = High Stakes | Title = Death's Head | Issue = 3 | Date =  February 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel UK]] | }}</ref>. Death's Head was later hired to captured the Doctor and his [[TARDIS]], which led him to being stuck in the present day (where he confronted the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'') and then sent by Reed Richards to the year 2020 (where he met the [[Iron Man 2020|Iron Man of that era]] and gave him friendly advice on mercenary work). The series was ended abruptly with a cliffhanger at issue 10 due to the closure of [[Marvel UK]]'s own creative team. 

In 1990, the ongoing storyline was resolved in the [[Marvel UK]] volume, ''Death's Head: The Body in Question'', which was serialized in the magazine ''Strip'' before being reprinted in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel]] format. In this story, Death's Head was becoming worried that he was started to enjoy killing and was prolonging missions for fun rather than simply doing it for money. In addition, Death's Head's origins were revealed to him for the first time. 

His mechanoid body had originally been constructed to host the life energy of the techno-mage Lupex, a psychotic who hunted beings for sport and stole their bodies upon killing them. However, a woman named Pyra, who wished to steal Lupex's secrets, ultimately decided to use the mechanoid body against him. She gave it a cold and calculating business-like mind, but before it could be used against Lupex, the body was stolen by an unknown party, enlarged to the size of the [[Cybertron]]ians, and catapulted through time. Death's Head was used as a pawn by Pyra, who wished to get him to a point where he could kill Lupex, while Lupex begun to hunt Death's Head with the intention of gaining his body. Driven to his mental limits and nearly killed, he eventually was able to kill Lupex and, refusing to be anything like his "father", killed him quickly while declaring he "kill[s] ''only'' for profit or survival!". 

Around this time, Death's Head's increasing 'cult status' meant that he also made a few appearances in some US Marvel comics, most notably the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'',<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #338</ref> ''[[She-Hulk]]''<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #24</ref> and ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #76</ref> In the former, he was hired by the Time Variance Authority as a freelance agent, but by She-Hulk he'd left their employ (stealing a time-machine in the process).

In the final issue of the Incomplete Death's Head, the Doctor claims to have been responsible for sending Death's Head to the Transformers universe. Despite being an manipulative being, especially in his seventh incarnation, it could be that this claim is false. There is nothing else within Death's Head's history to substantiate this claim.

===Death's Head II===<!-- This section is linked from [[Death Wreck]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->
Eventually, after many undocumented adventures, Death's Head was beheaded and his personality "assimilated" into the mind of the [[cyborg]] Minion. Minion was a [[cyborg]] created by Dr. [[Evelyn Necker]], a long-term pet project created after years of research which included the Xandarian Worldmind being temporarily uploaded into the Minion program's gestalt matrix. <ref>Nova #17 (2008)</ref> By the year 2020, she was an employee of [[AIM (comics)|AIM]] and the final Minion (as well as its prototype [[Death-Wreck]]) was designed to protect the organisation from a psychically predicted threat; it killed and assimilated the minds of multiple targets as preparation for this.  

Death's Head's personality overwhelmed Minion's programming before it could take out its final target (Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four), and they became the [[gestalt]] lifeform that called itself Death's Head II. Death's Head II was partnered with [[Tuck (comics)|Tuck]], an [[android|artificial human]] from the pseudo-[[medieval]] planet of Lionheart, where humans had outlawed advanced technology and waged war against androids and cyborgs. Neo-Nazi black mage [[Baron Strucker]] IV would magically combine himself with the original Death's Head's corpse to become the supervillain Charnel,<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/charneld.htm Charnel] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> a recurring enemy for Death's Head II and the threat AIM had predicted.

With other assimilated personalities mingling with that of the "freelance peacekeeper", Death's Head changed as a character, becoming a more heroic and far less amoral figure than the original, as well as losing his unique mannerisms. He hopped across time and realities in many adventures, often fighting for the greater good; in one adventure, he volunteered for a heroic sacrifice <ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/markus/loosecannons/book3.php ''Loose Cannons'' #3], page 16</ref> whereas before he'd have required payment. He encountered many Marvel characters, including the Fantastic Four, [[X-Men]], [[Spider-Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and crossed over with almost every Marvel UK character who was published at the time. He also made a cameo role in an ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' story set in the future.

The original Death's Head was only ever seen again in flashbacks or within Death's Head II's [[gestalt]] mind, as well as the twelve-issue series ''The Incomplete Death's Head'', in which Death's Head and Death's Head II join forces to defeat a servant of an enemy of the original Death's Head. (It was in the final issue of this series that the Doctor made his claim of being responsible for sending the original Death's Head to the Transformers universe)  The original 10 issue series was reprinted, completely this time, in a 12 issue mini series featuring new covers and an additional short story featuring Death's Head II replaying his memories.

Death's Head II's design was created by artist [[Liam Sharp]], and he was primarily scripted by [[Dan Abnett]].

Death's Head II titles included the four-issue introductory [[limited series|mini-series]], a sixteen-issue [[ongoing series]], and ''Death's Head II Gold'', a second mini-series that only got as far as issue 1 (although issue 0 features as a flip cover on ongoing issue 15).

Death's Head's exploits ultimately came to end with the (second) demise of Marvel UK's in house creative team, and aside from a cameo in [[Avengers Forever]], he has not been featured in a Marvel comic since. One title he guest-starred in, ''Loose Cannons'', featured Death's Head in a guest-star role but has only been released online.<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/markus/loosecannons/ Loose Cannons]</ref> A planned Punisher-Death's Head II series never saw the light of day, and Liam Sharp pitched a revival that Marvel passed on.<ref name=ultimatedh>[http://liamsharp.deviantart.com/art/Ultimate-Death-s-Head-46243797 Ultimate Death's Head] and [http://liamsharp.deviantart.com/art/Death-s-Head-reboot-pic-53360263 Death's Head revival] artwork on Liam Sharp's DeviantArt page</ref>

===="What If Death's Head I Had Lived?"====
During a stint on ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', Furman, alongside Geoff Senior, wrote a tale showing Death's Head surviving Minion's attack and later killing the cyborg in #54; something Furman has said was "deeply satisfying and cathartic".<ref name=vol2intro>Furman, Simon (2007). ''Death's Head Volume 2'', Panini Publishing, ISBN 1905239696</ref> Death's Head rebuilt his injured body into a larger, more heavily-armed form; meanwhile the Minion cyborg went on to kill Reed Richards, only to be possessed by Strucker and became Charnel itself. Evelyn Necker had to hire Death's Head to stop this threat. 

Using a time machine, Death's Head went back in time to gather the surviving Fantastic Four and several other superheroes, offering them a shot at avenging Reed by ending Charnel - and then let them all get killed softening up Charnel for him. Using his firepower on Charnel and goading him at not using the full potential of his gestalt mind, he got the cyborg to access these scientific minds - knowing this would allow Reed Richard's mind (still fighting within Charnel) to take control of the cyborg's motor functions, allowing him to kill it. His mission complete, Death's Head thought about the selfless, non-profit nature of heroes: "I just hope it's not catching, yes?"

===Death's Head 3.0===
The third version of Death's Head was introduced in a five-part storyline within the pages of Marvel's [[anthology]] series ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'', beginning in #16 (December 2005). Written by Death's Head creator Simon Furman and drawn by [[James Raiz]], the story is set 100 years in the future and does not appear to be directly linked to the previous Death's Head stories. 

[[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] are set to make peace with the UN and become a legitimate non-terrorist organisation. Hardliner AIM Senior Scientist Patricia Goddard has decided to stop the peace treaty and force AIM back underground by assassinating the UN Secretary-General, using a mysterious alien cyborg in AIM's possession codenamed Death's Head. Powered and given intelligence by an artificial variant on the [[Captain Universe|Uni-Power]], the cyborg is sent out in to the field with preprogrammed objectives, but the clash between its murderous inclinations and an instinctive desire to help people leave it unsure what side it wants to be on.

The final panel of the Death's Head 3.0  story concludes with an image of the cyborg with mouth horns, alluding to the original Death's Head. It is mentioned as now operating as a deniable troubleshooter for the GEIST organisation (Global Enforcement/Intelligence Symposium Taskforce), carrying out operations they can't be officially involved in for political reasons.

This incarnation went on to appear on Sakaar, during the Planet [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] series. Similar models are used by the Hulk as soldiers during the [[World War Hulk]] story and one is used an AIM courier in ''[[MODOK]]'s 11'' by Monica Rappaccini. 

It is implied in Simon Furman's introduction in the second Death's Head collection that this incarnation is actually a precursor to the original Death's Head, and that he would one day like to round the series off in one big 'loop'.<ref name=vol2intro />
