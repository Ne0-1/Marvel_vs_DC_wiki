'''Death's Head''' is the name of a cyborg bounty hunter created by [[Simon Furman]] for the [[Marvel UK]] imprint of [[Marvel Comics]].  After many adventures Death's head was "assimilated" by the cyborg Minion.  Death's Head's personality overwhelemed Minion and they became the [[gestalt]] lifeform Death's Head II.  Death's Head's assistants have included Spratt, a young gang member who rebuit Death's Head after he was destroyed by the government troubleshooting team [[Dragon's Claw]] and Tuck, an [[android|artificial human]] from the [[Medieval]] planet Lionheart.  Death's Head has encountered many other fictional characters including [[Doctor Who|The Doctor]], The [[Transformers]] and [[The Fantastic Four]].

Death's Heads exploits came to end with the demise of Marvel UK.
