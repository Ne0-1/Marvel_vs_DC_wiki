==Character biography==
Dr. Valerie Cooper was originally a special [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]], on national security issues, which include metahuman affairs. Originally, Valerie Cooper took a hardline concern on the problem, of the threat that superhumans and mutants posed to the [[United States]].

This position changed slightly when Valerie Cooper oversaw [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s team as [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], which operated under the new name of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. Meanwhile, Valerie Cooper and the Commission was directly involved in the events of the government demanding the identity of [[Captain America]] was their property to do anything with. With Steve Rogers giving up the identity of Captain America, Cooper supervised the recruitment of [[USAgent|John Walker]] and Battlestar. The two of them became the new Captain America and the new [[Bucky]]. Valerie Cooper's next duty was to hire [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], to create a machine to detect mutant powers.

The Freedom Force porject was shutdown, when several members: were killed, abandon in [[Kuwait]], and missing. Meanwhile, Cooper's mind was controlled mentally by the [[Shadow King]]. Fighting the Shadow King's control, Valerie turn her gun on herself, instead of shooting Mystique. Mystqiue managed to recieve aid from [[Nick Fury]], to undercover the truth of what was going on with Valerie. In order to find the truth, Mystique assumed the identity of Valerie Cooper, for a length of time. It wasn't until the defeat of the Shadow King, by the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor]], that Mystique and Cooper was able to return to their own lives.

After witnessing first-hand the deeds of mutants, throughout the years, Valerie Cooper wanted to give another government sponsored team another shot. She was able to convince several members of the X-Men annd their associates, to form a new X-Factor team. This new team replaced Freedom Force. She acted as government [[Liaison|liaison]] to the team. At one point during her tenure as liaison, Cooper was mentally controlled again. This time it was by the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. Afterwards, several members of the team lost their faith in her. Cooper decided to handle leadership of the team directly to Forge. With the world getting more dangerous around her and the leaving of some of the members, Cooper was forced to allow Mystique and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] to join. With Forge in command, the team went underground.

Cooper return to the Commission on Superhuman Affairs. In her position, she found herself helping the X-Men out on occasions. Later she was responsible for taking [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] away to a government facility (where he would be, though she did not know at the time, imprisoned by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]), following the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] incident. Valerie was instrumental in helping the old [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] defeat [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] and negotiated for the team their Presidential [[Pardon]].
