'''Valerie "Val" Cooper''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. She works for the Commission on Superhuman Affairs. She's most notable for her work as [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] liaison in the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. She was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita Jr.]], in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #176 (December 1983). 

==Character biography==
Dr. Valerie Cooper was originally a special [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]], on national security issues, which include metahuman affairs. Originally, Valerie Cooper took a hardline concern on the problem, of the threat that superhumans and mutants posed to the [[United States]].

This position changed slightly when Valerie Cooper oversaw [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s team as [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], which operated under the new name of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. Meanwhile, Valerie Cooper and the Commission was directly involved in the events of the government demanding the identity of [[Captain America]] under the argument that he was their property. With Steve Rogers giving up the identity of Captain America, Cooper supervised the recruitment of [[USAgent|John Walker]] and Battlestar. The two of them became the new Captain America and the new [[Bucky]]. Valerie Cooper's next duty was to hire [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], to create a machine to detect mutant powers.

The Freedom Force project was shutdown, when several members were killed while others were missing after being abandoned in [[Kuwait]]. During [[Muir Island Saga|The Muir Island Saga]] Cooper's mind fell under the control of the [[Shadow King]]. Valerie was ordered by the [[Shadow King]] to shoot [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] but fought the command and ended up turning the gun on herself.  Val was critically injured, but survived. Mystique, with the aid of [[Nick Fury]] and [[SHIELD]] hypnotists, went undercover as Val in an attempt to foil the [[Shadow King]]. It wasn't until the defeat of the Shadow King, by the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], that Mystique and Cooper were able to return to their own lives.

After witnessing first-hand the deeds of mutants throughout the years, Valerie Cooper wanted to give the concept of a government sponsored team another shot. She was able to convince several members of the X-Men and their associates to form a new X-Factor team.  This new team, comprised of [[Havok]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], [[Wolfsbane]], [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and [[Strong Guy]] replaced Freedom Force, with Val acting as government [[liaison]] to the team. Soon after Val was once again mentally controlled, this time it was by the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. Val was freed from the Acolytes' control, but her relationship with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] was damaged when it was revealed that she knew of [[Project Wideawake]], a new [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] project being developed by the U.S. Government. Cooper later decided to hand leadership of the team directly to [[Forge]]. With the world getting more dangerous around her and the leaving of some of the members, Cooper was forced to allow Mystique and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] to join. With Forge in command, the team went underground.

Cooper return to the Commission on Superhuman Affairs. In her position, she found herself helping the X-Men out on several occasions. She was later responsible for taking [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] away to a government facility following the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] incident. Valerie was instrumental in helping the old [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] defeat [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] and negotiated for the team their Presidential [[Pardon]].

Later she went on to help establish the [[Office of National Emergency]] (Or O*N*E), an official government branch dedicated to preparing and defense against superhuman threats.  The O*N*E, with  its first line of defense being the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E]] has now been called into action after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].
