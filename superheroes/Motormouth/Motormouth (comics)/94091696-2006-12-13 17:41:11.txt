Harley Davidson aka '''''Motormouth''''' is a fictional character created by Graham Marks and [[Gary Frank]] ([[Supreme Power]], [[The Incredible Hulk]]) as the titular character of her own series ''Motormouth'' (later ''Motormouth & Killpower''), part of a line of original comics released in the early-to-mid [[1990s]] by [[Marvel UK]], who had previously been mostly a reprint service. She is a teenage street-rat from [[London]], [[England]] with a fierce temper who curses contanstly, she is 5'4" tall and weights roughly 105 lbs.

''Motormouth'' ran for 12 issues with the plot of having Harley, and later her partner Killpower going to various alternate realities to their own (the regular Marvel Universe).

==Character History==

Harley was orphaned at age 11 and grew up as part of a gang that lived in the East End of [[London]] that lived by foraging and stealing what they needed to survive, her incredibly foul language earned her the nick-name 'motormouth'. When she was seventeen Harley was discovered by Laarson, an agent of [[Mys-Tech]], the shadowy organisation that featured in all of Marvel UK's 1990s titles, apparently she was candidate for his M.O.P.E.D (Mind Operated PErsonal Dematerialization) technology, that allowed people to jump between alternate realities and disguised a pair of MOPED units as training shoes, which Harley found and tried on, at the same time Laarson was executed by Mys-Tech's Techno-Wizards and agents were sent to find the units that Harley as trying on, in order to save her and the units, Laarson's subordinates activated the technology and sent her to another universe.

While still on the run from Mys-Tech, Harley was sent to a future where the world was covered in shopping malls, while there she bought a Soni-Muta 500 Unit, a [[microchip]] that allowed you to mentally tune into any radio station you wanted, this would later give her her sonic scream. Harley returned to her own universe and after being captured, temporarily worked for Mys-Tech, but went rouge after one mission in [[Tokyo]]. To escape the organisation she made a random jump to a planet named Tekron and Killpower, an agent of Mys-Tech was sent to find her, unable to escape him Harely reasoned with the agent instead, mentally little more than a small child Killpower was intrigued by Harley and has since been her partner. Harley was then badly injured on Tekron when a stray bullet hit her in the throat, Killpower used her Soni-Muta 500 and the MOPED technology to rebuild her and gave her superpowers in the form of a sonic scream and the ability to travel between universes without the aid of technology and the two became fugitives from Mys-Tech.

Motormouth and Killpower appeared in the Battletide mini-series, where [[Death's Head]] was hired by Mys-Tech to retrieve Killpower, while the two fought, Motormouth and Tuck, another Marvel UK character went on a shopping spree on an alien planet, the two then went to Mattrica Scorpio, a factory planet, where they were pursued by more Mys-Tech agents the Psycho-Warriors under the orders from Tyburn, a big name in the organisation. Harley was able to steal their MOPED unit, the only other unit besides hers that existed and after escaping that planet Harley teleported straight to the Mys-Tech Central and attacked Tyburn, immortal Tyburn survived her attack and Harley and Killpower fled the complex, though they did manage to remove the tracking devices Mys-Tech had implanted in them.

When Death's Head slew the Techno-Wizards during the ''Mys-Tech Wars'' mini-series, Motormoth was one of the six surrogates who repaired the damage done and restored the wizards and time to prevent, Harley was part of it 'because they needed six' and had little part in the actual events. Both Motormouth and Killpower were recruited by the Time Guardian in the ''Dark Guard'' mini-series to help stop a war on the planet Eopia. The war had been caused by Tyburn and Mys-Tech agents had infiltrated both sides of the war, Motormouth was instrumental in stopping in stopping a powerful Mys-Tech agent Collapser who had captured Killpower, her extra-sensory vision allowed her to see microfractures in his torso which in turn allowed Death's Head to smash him.

Motormouth and Killpower then guest starred in an issue of Incredible Hulk, illustrated by her co-creator Gary Frank, Hulk interrupted their vacation in London when the Hulk fell on thier dinner table from the ship owned by a super-villain Madman (the two had fought the previous issue), after Killpower and Hulk had a brief fight (a common occurrence in cross-over tales) and The Hulk humermously matched Motormouth's foul language in an argument, the two helped save [[Prince Charles]] from Madman (who threw him from [[Big Ben]]) and Harley used her sonic scream to knock him into [[London Bridge]], which collapsed it. The two helped to search through the rubble but did not find Madman.

Harleyâ€™s only other appearance since was a cameo in the Avengers Forever mini-series.

==Powers and abilities==
 
Harely can created defening sounds and force blasts by screaming/shouting, similar to [[X-Men|the X-Men's]][[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] or [[DC Comics]]' [[Black Canary]] and by humming at a low pitch can see through solid objects. She can also jump between alternate universes using the MOPED technology built into her, this technology also allows her to sense threats outside her normal field or range of senses. She also seems to have some ability to sense various forms of energy.

A profile given in the second issue of her series states she has extreme agility.

==Trivia==

* after being teleported away in issue 10 of ''Motormouth & Killpower'' a footnote stated that she was to have an adventure that would be told at a later date, but no such adventure was ever printed.
*her name is a blatant reference to [[Harley Davidson]] motorbikes, the series featured many other thinly-veiled references in names such as M.O.P.E.D ([[Moped]]) F.U.R (fur), the Fashion Police, C.A.Re and numerous others
* Motormouth & Killpower appear in Avengers Forever 11 & 12 as two of the numerous past, present and furture members of [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] but at present the two are do not have Avengers membership.
