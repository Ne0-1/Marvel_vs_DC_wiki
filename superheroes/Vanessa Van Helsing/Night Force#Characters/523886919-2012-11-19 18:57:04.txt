The main character of all three series is '''Baron Winters''', a sorcerer who would assemble a team of chosen individuals to fight supernatural threats. The Baron himself did not participate in the missions and would manipulate, sometimes unethically, others to do so for him. This was because, for reasons not revealed, he could not leave Wintersgate Manor, the labyrinthine mansion in Washington, D.C. where he lived. The mansion was located in a special juncture of time and space, allowing him to send his team to different places and times.

==Characters==
The team had a rotating membership, but notable members included:

*Vanessa Van Helsing&nbsp;– Granddaughter of [[Abraham Van Helsing]] and a powerful psychic.
*Jack Gold&nbsp;– Vanessa's husband, a reporter.
*Donovan Caine&nbsp;– A professor of [[parapsychology]] who lost an arm and a leg on one of the missions.
*Zadok Grimm&nbsp;– Apparently, an ancient warrior in the time of [[King David]]. He has an unexplained connection to Baron Winters.

==Other versions==
In issue three of the ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent]]: Superman's Reign'' series, a version of Night Force is featured. This group is a mystically-powered branch of the [[Nightwing]] organization, and its members are [[Jonah Hex|Hex]], [[Black Orchid]], and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]].
