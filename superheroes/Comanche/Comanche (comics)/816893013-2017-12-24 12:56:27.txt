==Fictional character biography==
The person who would become Comanche was a young street thug growing up in [[Harlem]] where he became a skilled archer and marksman.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #1</ref>

Comanche was recruited into a gang called the Rivals which also consisted of [[Luke Cage|Carl Lucas]], [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Willis Stryker]], and Shades. As a member of the Rivals, Shades engaged in a fight with a rival gang called the Diablos and many other gangs while also committing petty crimes and working for crime lord Sonny Caputo. Shades and Commanche were later arrested by the police and sentenced to Seagate Prison where they were tortured by the ruthless prison guard [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Albert Rackham|Albert "Billy Bob" Rackham]].<ref>''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #1"</ref>

After many years of abuse from Albert Rackham, Shades and Comanche escaped from Seagate Prison sometime after Albert Rackham was fired. Shades and Comanche decided that it was the opportunity to get revenge on their former tormentor.<ref>''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #14</ref> Shades and Comanche tried to get Luke Cage to help them in their plot only to learn that he has gone straight.<ref>''Luke Cage: Hero for Hire'' #16</ref>

Shades and Comanche returned and became hoodlums-for-hire where they clashed with Luke Cage and his new partner [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Power Man'' #48</ref> Even though they had a past association with Luke Cage, Shades and Comanche indicated that they would kill him if they are ordered to.<ref>''Power Man'' #49</ref>

Sometime later, Shades and Comanche were hired by [[Ward Meachum]] where he gave Shades a visor that shoots energy blasts and gave Comanche some [[Trick arrows|Trick Arrows]]. The two of them knocked out Ward Meachum where they have the bystanders tell Luke Cage that they have a score to settle when Ward Meachum regains consciousness. Luke Cage and Iron Fist tracked Shades and Comanche to the [[George Washington Bridge]] where they learned about their employer. Luke Cage and Iron Fist managed to defeat the two of them as the police arrive. When the police fail to remove Shades' visor, he used one more blast to knock Luke Cage and Iron Fist off the George Washington Bridge.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #98</ref> Shades and Comanche were later sprung from prison.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #99</ref> The two of them tried to hold off Luke Cage when he attacked the Meachum building only to be defeated when Luke Cage knocked a pillar on them.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #100</ref>

Shades was among the several gunmen that were employed by Viktor Smerdilovisc. He and the others came in conflict with the [[Marvel Knights]]. Shades was taken down by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]].<ref>''Marvel Knights'' #12</ref>

During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Shades and Comanche have gone their separate ways upon Shades going straight.

After the group was remanded to Ryker's Island, Nightshade's solicitor [[Big Ben Donovan]] was able to get Dontrell Hamilton, Mr. Fish, and Spear out while Comanche, Chemistro, and Cheshire Cat had to remain due to them having warrants and/or parole violations.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2</ref>
