'''Overmind''' is a [[villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. 

==Fictional character biography==
The Overmind is an alien belonging to the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] of Eyung, and was born uncounted millennia ago. Grom acted as one of their warlords, leading massacres of entire species. He was also the reigning champion in their gladiatorial arenas. When his race had engaged the Gigantians in a war about to lead to mutual absolute destruction, Grom's physical prowess made him chosen as a fitting receptacle for their entire population of several hundred million minds, and was launched in a protective capsule, unconscious for thousands of years while assimilating them into one single mind. 

In more recent years he awoke, and piloted his ship to the nearest inhabited planet which happened to be Earth. He here came into contact with the [[Fantastic Four]], who had been warned by [[Uatu the Watcher]], but proved unable to stop him until the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] intervened and shrank the Overmind into a subatomic [[microverse]], where he was left completely isolated with no available conquests, and went mad from the strain.

He was later discovered by another collective consciousness known as [[Null, the Living Darkness]]. In his current broken state Null managed to take control of him and sent him on a campaign against a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] inhabited by the [[Squadron Supreme]]. The Overmind mentally enslaved both the Squadron and this Earth's leaders, while posing as the U.S. president [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Kyle Richmond]], and planned to build an armada to invade other worlds. When [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] brought the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] to assist him, they managed to free the Squadron. Meanwhile Null had leeched away the Overmind's mental energies, but yet another psychic composite entity, of 7 human telepaths, empowered by the assembled heroes, managed to defeat it, and came to inhabit the weakened Grom.

For a while this entity was welcomed into the Defenders' ranks, but grew uncomfortable and eventually left, while making them forget it was ever one of them. It tried to find a purpose by attempting to help a town of 800 people dying of chemical poisoning, by making them ignore their ailments, but was convinced to let them be aware of reality rather than an illusion. 

When the Squadron transferred to this Earth, the Overmind's original psyche was stirred into awareness and absorbed the telepaths into his own billion-wide whole. He once more controlled the Squadron to take revenge against the Stranger by organizing a raid against the latter's laboratory world. He freed many of the Stranger's superhuman captives to fuel his enslaved ranks. He locked the Stranger in a stalemated mental battle. When several [[Watchers]] arrived on an unrelated business the Overmind was wrought by paranoia, believing the Stranger to have summoned them for assistance, inducing psychosis, and enabling the Stranger to capture him as a subject of study.  

He later apparently managed to escape and declined participation in the [[Mad Thinker]]'s quest for vengeance against the Fantastic Four.

Shortly afterwards Grom was affected by the [[Purple Man]]'s mind-controlling pheromones, and used to both monitor New York's population, as the latter's chemicals spread in the water supply, as well as control potential threats like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but disappeared after the Purple Man's defeat. He was eventually located by [[Baron Zemo]] and his Thunderbolts, during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] event, and coerced to join the group or face jail time.

==Powers and abilities==
The Overmind possesses vast psychic powers derived from the billion eternals composing his essence, including telepathy, telekinesis, or illusion-casting, and can use them over great distances. His victims are completely unaware of his influence unless he allows them. Even when severely weakened, with his mind comatose and his body under the influence of the 7 telepaths, whose assembled might was likened to a drop in the ocean compared to his own, he was able to control the minds of 800 people, and at full power he managed to push the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], a cosmic entity rivaling [[Galactus]] in scope, to his mental limits. 

His sole weaknesses are his inability to control Eternals of any race, and his schizoid composition can make his abilities weaken immensely when sufficiently stressed. 

Additionally he possesses great physical strength, magnified sevenfold through psionic augmentation, and even more impressive durability. He is an experienced veteran of many wars, with considerable fighting skills.
