'''Stevie Hunter''' is a [[comic book]] character in [[Marvel comics]]. Her first appearance was in Uncanny X-Men #139 as a surprise dance teacher for the newest X-Man/Student, [[Kitty Pryde]], a.k.a. Shadowcat. She has continued to make some scattered appearance in X-Men comic books.

==Fictional character biography==
Stevie Hunter was a professional dancer, but an injury to her knee ruined her career and forced her to discontinue her dancing full time. As an alternative, she began teaching dance classes at a studio in [[Salem Center]]. Her most notable student being [[Kitty Pryde]]. She later began classes with the rookie [[New Mutants]] as well. With them she focused more on ballet. She would continue these sessions over the years.

Stevie quickly became a best friend to Kitty, and on occasions made [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], who had unofficially taken up the mantle of Kitty's surrogate mother, slightly jealous of the attention that Kitty gave to her. 

Stevie Hunter was, shortly after her first appearance, captured by [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]], but was rescued by the [[X-Men]]. Though, at this time, Kitty was ill and did not participate in the mission.

Stevie has long been an ally of the X-Men, knowing their full secrets. At one time she cautions Kitty Pryde not to get into a fight, as Kitty knows so much of the martial arts, she is a danger to the average civilian.

Stevie has tried to stay out of the fights the mutants get in but has become involved in a few. In one case, she and the New Mutants were involved in a fight against the demon [[S'ym]], who attacks them inside the X-Mansion. In trying to get a rattled Magik away from the fight, she ends up face to face with the demon. Her life was saved only by the magical might<!-- OK here: don't correct it--> of Illyana herself turning the demon's loyalties. Even then S'ym offers to kill Stevie, for knowing too much. The incident visibly overwhelms Stevie and she asks what Illyana has become.

In a later incident, Stevie was present when forces from [[Genosha]] attacked the X-Mansion. She made it through a trapdoor to safety below, but unfortunately Storm, Warlock, Rictor, Boom-Boom and Wolfsbane, one of her original students, were kidnapped. Stevie did not go with on the rescue mission.

In one of her last major appearances, the [[Shadow King]] had taken over the mind of [[Colossus (comics)|Peter Rasputin]], Illyana's brother. Stevie helps [[Professor X]] stay one step ahead of Peter, until they can get to the mansion's [[Danger Room]]. This allows them to subdue Peter without harming him.
