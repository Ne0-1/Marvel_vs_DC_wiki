'''Miek''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]], first seen in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #92 during the "Planet Hulk" storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
Miek is a member of planet Sakaar's native race of [[insectoid]]s. When he was young his father and most of his hive are attacked and killed by local Imperials, forcing Miek to flee underground. 

He is freed, as an outcast slave, during Hulk's battle with the Red King, the despotic ruler of Sakaar. Miek follows the Hulk and several other powerful entities, as they are part of the '[[Warbound]]'. Miek and the others had formed a bond of brotherhood during a session of forced gladitorial games under the command of the Red King.

Miek and the Warbound end up in the village where his father was slain; welcomed guests after protecting the town from rampaging robots. The Warbound discover the town is keeping Miek's siblings and several of his species as slaves. They are freed and the town is abandoned. Miek's people join the Warbound as allies.

Miek forms a bond with a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] Queen known as "[[No-Name]]," due to their insect nature. Within a short time Miek's undergoes a metamorphosis and evolves into a giant heavily armored "King" version of his race.

The Warbound and their allies attempt to protect a larger town from the threat of the 'Spikes', an alien race that overwhelms and feeds upon any biological form they can find. Unfortunately this town is also keeping a slave, specifically the last egg-laying queen of Miek's race. The Queen becomes one of the victims of the Spikes, though she lasts some time due to willpower. Eventually she is put down as self-defense.

Miek is given a position of leadership as the Hulk and his fellow allies, Hiroim and Caiera attempt to gain the allegiance of the latter two's people.

=== Earth ===

Miek is one of the few survivors when the shuttle that had brought Hulk to Sakarr explodes, devastating the world. The [[World War Hulk]] storyline details Hulk's revenge on the people he believes responsible for the death of Sakaar and his wife and child.

Miek comes into conflict with the Hulk's old friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] over the Hulk's actions, both of them believing that they know what the Hulk 'should' be as a hero. The two agree to disagree  and help their friends in their own way, although Miek has brought Jones to the Madison Square Gardens arena to witness the defeat of the four Illuminati members responsible for banishing the Hulk.

Miek's hivelings are used by [[Mung (comics)|Mung]] the Inconceivable, but the [[Punisher]] killed many of them as well as Mung himself in single combat.<ref>''[[Punisher]] War Journal'' #12</ref>

After a climatic battle with the Sentry in which both participants are reverted back to their human forms, Bob Reynolds is knocked out by Bruce Banner. In an attempt to bring the Hulk back, Miek attempts to stab Bruce but instead impales Rick. 

According to writer Greg Pak, "Miek was aiming for Bruce — to force him to turn back into the Hulk and finish the destruction that Miek believes is the Hulk's entire reason for being. Miek doesn't see that as hurting the Hulk — he sees it as fulfilling his Warbound oath by helping the Hulk become who he's destined to become... Miek believes the time has come for all things to end, for the Worldbreaker to wash away this world of hate and pain so that the next thing can come." This succeeds in enraging Banner and turning him back into the Hulk.<ref>''[[World War Hulk]]'' #5</ref>

The Hulk stabs Miek and continues to beat him up, which is what Miek wanted. When the other Warbound members try stopping the Hulk, Miek reveales how he had seen the Red King's people load an old warp core onto the shuttle, which had caused the explosion that destroyed Sakaar.  Desiring to remind the Hulk that he is a warrior and not a peacemaker, he kept that information secret. When a horrified No-Name attacks Miek, pointed out how millions had been killed, Miek says "We all *kik* *kik*  must die. All this *kik* passing, so the next *kik* thing can come... so the worldbreaker... can finally make an end."

When the Hulk becomes so enraged that he begins to lose control, he tells Iron Man to "Do it. Before I break the world!" Iron Man activates a series of satellite devices that opens fire and eventually leaves the Hulk in his Bruce Banner form, unconscious. During this, a weakened Miek screams "No, Hulk! You can't let him!"

=== Imprisoned ===

Miek is next seen imprisoned in SHIELD's  [[Negative Zone]] prison, angry at the Warbound for trying to save him and believing that they had betrayed the Hulk.

In the mini-series "Warbound",  Miek, still in the Zone, reveals to SHIELD agent [[Kate Waynesboro]] that he believes the Hulk was destined to destroy everyone and everything, including his fellow Warbound members; that the Warbound were wrong to fight this. He also tells the agent various stories of his former allies that all showed the savage side within them and their weaknesses. He reveals that he had a sexual relationship with [[No-Name]] that spawned children even though they where killed by No-Name herself, after they went on a rampage. Meik chems with Waynesboro and knows of her plan to help the Warbound before she goes and about her relationship with the Hulk but doesn't tell or interfere in her plans, but just warns her. It is most likely that Miek is still under S.H.I.E.L.D Surveillance fully healed in the Negative Zone as the events of the [[Red Hulk]] and [[Secret Invasion]] happen.

==Alternate Versions==
===What If?===
In the ''[[List of What If issues#Sixth Series (2007)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?'', Miek is also killed in the destruction of Sakaar when he runs into a volcanic crack formed as Sakaar breaks apart, believing that the Hulk is coming towards them, and is burned to death.
