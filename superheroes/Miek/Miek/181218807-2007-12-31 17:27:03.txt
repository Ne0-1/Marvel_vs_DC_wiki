'''Miek''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]], first seen in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #92 during the "Planet Hulk" storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
Miek is a member of planet Sakaar's native race of [[insectoid]]s. When he was young his father and most of his hive were attacked and killed by local Imperials, forcing Miek to flee underground. He was accidentally rescued, as an outcast slave, during Hulk's battle with the Red King. Soon after, the Warbound escaped with Meik secretly leading them to the place where his father was killed. The Warbound then aided him in securing his revenge. Miek and a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] Queen known as "[[No-Name]]," who formed a connection due to their insect nature, freed Miek's brothers and adding the Warbound to his Hive. Within a short time he underwent a metamorphosis and evolved into a giant heavily armored "King" version of his race.

Miek recently located one of the last Queens of his race, at an egg farm at which the Warbound were hiding. Unfortunately for Miek, and his species, the Queen was consumed by a Spike infection and had to be killed. Miek leads the Warbound in Hulk's place while Hulk, Hiroim, and Caiera attempt to obtain the allegiance of Caiera and Hiroim's people.

Miek travelled with the Hulk to Earth in the [[World War Hulk]] storyline to aid his quest for vengeance after the explosion that killed Caiera. During his time on Earth, Miek clashed with the Hulk's first friend on Earth, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] over the Hulk's actions, both of them believing that they know what the Hulk 'should' be as a hero. To date, the two of them have merely agreed to disagree and help their friends in their own way, although Miek has brought Jones to the Madison Square Gardens arena to witness the defeat of the four Illuminati members.

Miek's hivelings were used by [[Mung (comics)|Mung]] the Inconceivable. The Punisher kills many of them as well as Mung himself in single combat.<ref>''[[Punisher]] War Journal'' #12</ref>

When the Hulk reverted to Bruce Banner after battling the Sentry, Miek tried stabbing him to enrage him and turn him back into the Hulk. [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] pushed Banner out of the way and was stabbed instead (according to writer Greg Pak, "Miek was aiming for Bruce — to force him to turn back into the Hulk and finish the destruction that Miek believes is the Hulk's entire reason for being. Miek doesn't see that as hurting the Hulk — he sees it as fulfilling his Warbound oath by helping the Hulk become who he's destined to become... Miek believes the time has come for all things to end, for the Worldbreaker to wash away this world of hate and pain so that the next thing can come.") This succeeded in enraging Banner and turning him back into the Hulk.<ref>''[[World War Hulk]]'' #5</ref>

The Hulk stabbed Miek and continued to beat him up, which is what Miek wanted. When the other Warbound members tried stopping the Hulk, Miek revealed how he had seen the Red King's people load an old warp core onto the shuttle, which had caused the explosion that destroyed Sakaar.  Desiring to remind the Hulk that he was a warrior and not a peacemaker, he kept that information secret, killing millions in Crown City and driving the Hulk's rage. When a horrified No-Name attacked Miek, pointed out how millions had been killed, Miek said "We all *kik* *kik*  must die. All this *kik* passing, so the next *kik* thing can come... so the worldbreaker... can finally make an end."

When the Hulk becomes so enraged that he begins to lose control, he tells Iron Man to "Do it. Before I break the world!" Iron Man activates a series of satellite devices that opens fire and eventually leaves the Hulk in his Bruce Banner form, unconscious. During this, a weakened Miek screams "No, Hulk! You can't let him!"

Miek is next seen imprisoned in SHIELD's  Negative Zone prison, angry at the Warbound for trying to save him and believing that they had betrayed the Hulk.

==Alternate Versions==
===What If?===
In the ''[[List of What If issues#Sixth Series (2007)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?'', Miek is also killed in the destruction of Sakaar when he runs into a volcanic crack formed as Sakaar breaks apart, believing that the Hulk is coming towards them, and is burned to death.
