'''Miek''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]], first seen in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #92 during the "Planet Hulk" storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
Miek was a member of planet Sakaar's native race of insectoids. When he was young his father and most of his hive were attacked and killed by local Imperials, forcing Miek to flee underground. He was accidentally rescued, as an outcast slave, during Hulk's battle with the [[Red King]]. Soon after, the Warbound escaped with Miek secretly leading them to the place where his father was killed. The Warbound then aided him in securing his revenge. Miek and Brood, who have formed a connection due to their insect nature, freed Miek's brothers and added the Warbound to his Hive. Within a short time he underwent a metamorphosis and evolved into a giant heavily armoured "King" version of his race.

Miek located one of the last Queens of his race, at an egg farm at which the Warbound were hiding. Unfortunately for Miek, and his species, the Queen was consumed by a Spike infection and had to be killed. Miek led the Warbound in Hulk's place while [[Hulk (Comics)|Hulk]], [[Hiroim]], and [[Caiera]] attempted to obtain the allegiance of Caiera and Hiroim's people.

Following the death of Caiera Oldstrong, Miek and the rest of the Warbound accompanied the Hulk back to Earth, where they pledged to aid him in a quest of vengeance against those responsible for the Hulk's forced exile.

On Earth, Miek was one of the most vocal in encouraging the destruction of the planet in revenge for what was done. By the end, it was revealed that Miek knew all along that the Illuminati were not responsible. Red King loyalists had planted a damaged warp core on the Hulk's ship hoping it would kill the Hulk. Miek did not tell the Hulk hoping it would encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Enraged, the Hulk and [[No-Name]] nearly killed Miek. After the Hulk's defeat Miek was captured by SHIELD in Wonderland and relayed information about the Warbound to help recapture them.

Following the Skrull Invasion, Miek was presumably still imprisoned in the Negative Zone supervised by Wonderland's freed inmates.

==Alternate Versions==
===What If?===
In the ''[[List of What If issues#Sixth Series (2007)|What If?]]'' storyline ''What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?'', Miek is also killed in the destruction of Sakaar when he runs into a volcanic crack formed as Sakaar breaks apart, believing that the Hulk is coming towards them, and is burned to death. His death prevents anyone from discovering the truth of Sakaar's destruction and leads to Caiera's conquest of Earth.
