She is a [[New God]] of [[New Genesis]], the daughter of [[Himon]] and the wife of [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. She made her [[first appearance]] in ''[[DC Graphic Novel]]'' #4: ''[[The Hunger Dogs]]'' (1985), written and pencilled by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional biography==
Bekka is the daughter of [[Himon]], one of the [[New Gods]] whose achievements include invention of the sentient [[Mother Box]] computers and discovery of the "x-element" that fueled his co-creation of the teleporting [[Boom Tube]]s alongside fellow scientist [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. For many years, Bekka lived with her father in secret on [[Apokolips]] as Himon organized an underground uprising against [[Darkseid]]'s tyrannical rule. Hunted for his role in this planned insurgence, Himon took extra care to shield Bekka from Darkseid's notice. Himon never imagined that Bekka would fall in love with [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], Darkseid's own son, when he stumbled into their lives. After healing the wounded Dog of War, Himon and Bekka aided Orion in freeing his mother [[Tigra (DC Comics)|Tigra]] from imprisonment. For this act, Himon was seemingly slain by the dread lord of Apokolips. Bekka then accompanied Orion and Tigra to [[New Genesis]], where her love continues to soothe the savagery that lurks within the Dog of War.

In the storyline "Torment" in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #37–42 (August 2007–January 2008), she and [[Batman]] help [[Superman]] escape from a fictional planet called Tartaros, where Superman is being held prisoner by [[Desaad]]. During the rescue mission, she and Batman fall in love and her affection causes Batman to reflect on the lack of love he has forced himself to endure. Bekka likens her spell of desire to a siren's call but says that it affects her as well. In the end, however, she leaves with Orion when he comes to get her. In her home, while thinking that, staying with Orion, she will forget Batman, some unknown person approaches her, and she is then apparently killed as part of ''[[Death of the New Gods]]''.

In ''Death of the New Gods'', it is initially revealed that her killer, and the killer of all the New Gods, is none other than her father Himon. However, the killer was later shown to actually be the [[Infinity Man]], disguised as Himon.<ref name="dc-ency"/>
