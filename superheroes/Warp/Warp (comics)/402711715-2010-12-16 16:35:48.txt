'''Warp''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[New Teen Titans]]'' vol. 1, #14 (December 1981).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Emil LaSalle''''s origin is unknown. This [[France|French]] [[supervillain]] had previously fought [[The Allies (comics)|Phantasmo]] and [[Fleur-de-Lis (DC Comics)|Fleur-de-Lis]], prior to being approached by the [[Brain (comics)|Brain]], [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Phobia  (comics)|Phobia]] to become part of their new [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. At first, Warp refused but, after being attacked by Captain Toulon and trapped on the "Earth-11" [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate Earth]], Warp changed his mind and joined the group. (The whole affair had been engineered by [[Doctor Mist]] to get rid of Toulon and save the survivors of that alternate Earth.)

Warp has fought the Teen Titans on different occasions, later resurfacing with the other Brotherhood of Evil members who were then called the Society of Sin.

When the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] altered the sanity of dozens of supervillains, Warp was one of those affected. He attacked the [[United Nations]] building, sending the top halves of many people into deep space.

In the [[Villains United]] "[[Infinite Crisis]]" special, Warp, now partially cured, was seen working with [[Doctor Psycho]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth.

More recently, he kidnapped [[Icemaiden]], a service paid for by [[Delores Winters]]. Winters stole Icemaiden's skin, but the heroine survived, now in a comatose state in [[S.T.A.R. Labs]].

During the [[One Year Later]] story, Warp rejoined the Brotherhood of Evil. He was most recently seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where he was used by [[Lex Luthor]] as a component in a teleportation device and was seemingly killed when it self-destructed.

==Powers and abilities==
Besides flying, Warp can open portals between any two locations that he chooses and travel through them and bring others through it as well. Repeated use of this power tires him out.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Warp has appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]]. He first appeared in the episode "How Long is Forever".

Unlike his comic book version, Warp is a [[time travel|time-travelling]] villain from one-hundred years in the future. He travels to [[Jump City]] in order to steal a device that (his) history said he had stolen, but the Titans appear to stop him. Warp attempts to escape, but [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] follows him into a time portal. They end up twenty years in the future after she takes a crucial part of his suit. He steals the part back and fixes his machine, but before he is able to escape, the future Titans ([[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Animal Man]] &mdash; the new name of [[Beast Boy]]'s future self &mdash;, a run-down [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], and a previously unstable [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] in her frequently-seen white cloak) apprehend him. In the battle, his time suit malfunctions and he is reduced to the age of an infant. Starfire returned to the present at the time when Warp was escaping back to his own time.

Warp makes a brief cameo in "Cyborg the Barbarian" when [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] mentions what happens when history is tampered with. He makes one final appearance as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] in "Calling All Titans", aiding fellow supervillain [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]] in an attack on [[Herald (comics)|Herald]]. Warp participates in the subsequent showdown with the Titans and is later frozen by [[Mas y Menos]].

*Warp/Emil LaSalle appears in the tenth season of of [[Smallville]] as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]], assisting [[Rick Flag]], and is portrayed by [[Elias Toufexis]].
