Warp is the name of a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] that has fought the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] on different occasions.

==History==
'''Emil LaSalle''''s origin is unknown. This [[France|French]] [[supervillain]] had previously fought [[The Allies (comics)|Phantasmo]] and [[Fleur-de-Lis (DC Comics)|Fleur-de-Lis]], prior to being approached by the [[Brain (comics)|Brain]], [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Phobia  (comics)|Phobia]] to become part of their new [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. At first, Warp refused but, after being attacked by Captain Toulon and trapped on the "Earth-11" [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate Earth]], Warp changed his mind and joined the group. (The whole affair had been engineered by [[Doctor Mist]] to get rid of Toulon and save the survivors of that alternate Earth.)

As a member of the new Brotherhood, Warp fought the Teen Titans when a member of that group and shows his loyalty to new members of that group and will not leave them in the lurch. Since Warp has fought the Teen Titans on different occasion, he later resurfaced with the other Brotherhood of Evil members who are now called the Society of Sin.

In the [[Villains United]] "[[Infinite Crisis]]" special, Warp was seen working with [[Doctor Psycho]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth.

==Powers==
Besides flying, Warp can open portals between any two locations that he chooses and travel through them and bring others through it as well. Repeated use of this power tires him out.

[[Image:Teen Titans season 2 episode 1.jpg|thumb|right|Warp as featured in the Teen Titans TV series.]]'''Warp''' in ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'', voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]], is a [[time travel|time-travelling]] villain (a power which he didn't have in the comics) from one-hundred years in the future. He travels to [[Jump City]] in order to steal a device that (his) history said he had stolen, but the Titans appear to stop him. However, his technology is too powerful for them to overcome and he attempts to escape, but [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] follows him into a time portal. They end up twenty years in the future after she took a crucial part of his suit. He steals the part back and fixes his machine, but before he is able to escape, the future Titans ([[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Animal Man]]-- the new name of [[Beast Boy]]'s future self ---, a considerably rusty [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], and an unstable [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] in her frequently-seen white cloak) apprehend him. In the battle, his time suit malfunctions and he is reduced to the age of an infant. He appears in the episode "How Long Is Forever?" and his infant form makes a cameo in "Cyborg the Barbarian" when [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] is mentioning about what happens when history is tampered with. He also cameos (in his adult form) in "Homecoming pt. 2". No explanation has yet been given for his reappearance, though since he can travel through time, it may simply be another version of him. He later appears with [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]] to take down [[Herald (comics)|Herald]], but they were defeated.
