Warp is the name of a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] that has fought the [[Teen Titans]] on different occasions.

==History==

Emil LaSalle's origin is unknown. The [[France|French]] [[nationalist]] joined the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] to get back at [[Madame Rouge]] who had somehow offended him in the past. Taking the name Warp, he joined the group because of the team's interest of taking their revenge against Rouge. He fought the Teen Titans when a member of that group and shows his loyalty to new members of that group and will not leave them in the lurch. Since Warp has fought the Teen Titans on different occasion, he later resurfaced with the other Brotherhood of Evil members who are now called the [[Society of Sin]].

==Powers==

Besides flying, Warp can open portals between any two locations that he chooses and travel through them and bring others through it as well. Repeated use of this power tires him out.

'''Warp''' (voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]]) is a [[time travel|time-travelling]] villain (a power which he didn't have in the comics) from one-hundred years in the future. He travels to Jump City in order to steal a device that (his) history said he had stolen, but the Titans appear to stop him. However, his technology is too powerful for them to overcome and he attempts to escape, but [[Starfire (DC Comics)|Starfire]] follows him into a time portal. They end up twenty years in the future after she took a crucial part of his suit. He steals the part back and fixes his machine, but before he is able to escape, the future Titans (Nightwing, Animal Man-- the new name of Beast Boy's future self ---, a considerably rusty Cyborg, and an unstable Raven in her frequently-seen white cloak) apprehend him. In the battle, his time suit malfunctions and he is reduced to the age of an infant. He appears in the episode "How Long Is Forever?" and his infant form makes a cameo in "Cyborg the Barbarian" when [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] is mentioning about what happens when history is tampered with. He also cameos (in his adult form) in "Homecoming pt. 2". No explanation has yet been given for his reappearance.
