The '''N'Garai''' are a [[fictional character|fictional race]] found in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  They are a race of [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] created by [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]], and have come into conflict with the [[Midnight Sons]] and the [[X-Men]].  The N'Garai are ruled by [[Kierrok]] the Damned.

The N'Garai once lived on Earth, but left for another dimension roughly a million years ago and are now intent on returning to Earth.  Their extensions into the physical world tend to take the form of small, stone towers. Destruction of these towers has, many times, harmed the N'Garai, though the towers sometimes regenerate over time.

One of these towers has appeared time and time again on the grounds of the [[X-Mansion]]. One of the first incursions involved a larger demon confronting [[Shadowcat]], who was alone in the mansion at the time. She eventually destroyed it with the jet engines of the X-Men's plane.

Further incursions have been met with resistance from, notably, [[Wolverine]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Cecilia Reyes]], Maggott and Nightcrawler.

In one incident, a subset of demons had taken to kidnapping various members of Earth's dimensions, such as people from the nearby town of [[Salem Center]] and Russian oil refinery workers. They were submitting them to various forms of dissection, suspect by Salem police as murders. Maggott was suspected of causing the murders, but he was cleared when Reyes, a doctor, saw that Wolverine, who was able to heal from his injuries, had been classically autopsied.

The fight was taken to the N'Garai dimension, where the X-Men rescued many innocent people and seemingly stopped the wave of current infections. Several of the demons had escaped to the forest around the X-Mansion. A squad involving Cecila, Marrow and Beast faced them down and defeated them. The X-Men and the he rescued civilians returned in another location on Earth. One of the men showed signs a powerful N'Garai demon had in fact made the return trip inside of him.

Wolverine has entered the N'Garai dimension on at least two different occasions. It is difficult for him, as it's infestation of creatures hostile to earth and the fact time passes slower there makes it easy for him to lose himself in long stretches of slaying. In both occasions, it took the presence of other X-Men to help bring him back from the brink.

==First appearance==
{{Cleanup|date=November 2007}}
The first appearance of N'Garai was not Uncanny X-men 143. The demons first appeared way back around Uncanny X-men #97. Cyclops accidentally blew open the top of the cairn in anger over Warpath's death. While cyclops and the other X-Men fought [[Kierrok]] the Damned (especially Wolverine, who went crazy-mad in front of his fellow X-Men for the first time while fighting the Demon), Storm was able to seal the tomb again later in the fight with a massive electrical discharge when smaller servant demons tried to drag her into the opening (doubtless with the intent to trap her within there own dimension); the dark, confined space below her (and their vile touch) triggered an extreme claustrophobic reaction in her - this caused her greater than normal lightning discharge, searing the tomb shut. It was the issue introducing Moira McTaggert, who was masquerading as a housekeeper to keep an eye on her old friend Charles Xavier (who was ill due to an unintentional mind meld with Lilandra). She surprised everyone (especially Sean the Banshee, who was immediately attracted to her) by attacking [[Kierrok]] the Damned with a machine gun.
