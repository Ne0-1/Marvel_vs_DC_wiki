'''Black Condor''' is the name of three [[DC Comics]] superheroes who have all been members of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]. Richard Grey Jr. the first Black Condor was originally a [[Quality Comics]] character.

==Richard Grey Jr.==
===Quality Comics===
A [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] mystery man who possessed the power of flight, Black Condor was a member of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], a group that operated from [[World War II]] on. '''Richard Grey, Jr.''' (alias Tom Wright) was the first Black Condor.

His story inspired by [[Tarzan]], he was born on a caravan conducting a scientific expedtion through 1940's [[Mongolia]]. The caravan was later attacked by bandits and everyone was killed except for the newly born Richard. The child was rescued by a mysterious local race of super-intelligent [[Condor]]s which took in and raised the boy.

A mountain [[hermit]] named "Father Pierre" eventually discovered the boy, and with much effort eventually civilized the feral child and taught him how to speak english. Young Richard tracked down and killed the Mongolian bandits who had killed his parents and then departed for [[United States|America]] where he uncovered a plot to kill [[United States Senator]] Thomas Wright. He was too late to save Wright from assassination, and so decided to use his identity. He adopted the guise of Black Condor to fight crooked [[politicians]], [[rum-running|bootleggers]] and [[racketeering|racketeers]].

===DC Comics===
In the DC Comics universe his power was [[retconned]] to being caused by exposure to a radioactive meteor. Here he met [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] and joined his group the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], and later the [[All-Star Squadron]]. 

He was among a group of Golden and Silver Age heroes who helped the JLA repel an [[Appelaxian]] invasion in the '''JLA: Year One''' mini-series by [[Mark Waid]]. He appeared more recently as a ethereal ''[[spirit guide]]'' in the pages of Ryan Kendall's Black Condor series.

==Ryan Kendall==

The second Black Condor, '''Ryan Kendall''', derived his powers of flight, telekinesis, and healing from the genetic experiments of his grandfather, Creighton. A member of an organization called the Society of the Wing, Creighton and his allies had been attempting to create a man who could fly. After numerous attempts, Ryan was the only success. Ryan eventually rebelled and escaped from his grandfather, who made frequent attempts to recapture the youth in order to study and reproduce his abilities.

A mysterious telekinetic who pretty much kept to himself, Ryan Kendall was adamant when he first appeared as the Black Condor that he was not a super-hero. However, time was to prove differently, and he fought the good fight alongside others, notably [[Primal Force]], the [[Justice League]] (for a brief time), and alone. Eventually, he went to [[Opal City]], where he felt very much at home. 

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1, Kendall was killed by a powerful beam (apparently fired by [[Sinestro]]; he said "let's see if the old man is as soft as the bird" indicating he was responsible) in an attack by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] his team was sent to investigate.

==John Trujillo==
{{spoiler}}
Solicitations for ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #3 mention a new Black Condor named John Trujillo whose home turf is the Arizona desert. According to the preview John was given the hereditary powers of the Black Condor by '''Tocotl''' a [[Mayan]] Spider Goddess.[http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/FreedomFighters/03/USFF03_Pre.html][http://www.earthlife.net/chelicerata/myth-tar.html]

According to the prologue to #3, it stated that Tocotl had granted the mantle of Black Condor to a Native American brave some time during the [[19th century]]. This changes the number of people who have taken the persona of Black Condor to four instead of three.

==Powers and abilities==
*The first Black Condor possessed the power of flight which he had somehow absorbed by osmosis from the race of super-intelligent Condors who had raised him (later [[retcon]]ned to being the result of exposure to a radioactive [[meteorite]]). He also carried a "black light" pistol.
*The second Black Condor possessed a talent for [[Telekinesis]] which he also used to fly, as well as limited empathic abilities.
*The third Black Condor has so far only demonstrated the ability of flight, but has been credited by Tocotl as an elemental of the sky and the earth. He is extremely strong, fast and seems quite ruthless.
