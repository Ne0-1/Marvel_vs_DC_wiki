Black Condor is the name of two [[DC Comics]] superheroes who have both been members of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]. 

==Black Condor I==
A [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] mystery man who possessed the power of flight, Black Condor was a member of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], a group which operated from [[World War II]] onwards. Richard Grey Jr. (alias Tom Wright) was the first Black Condor.

==Black Condor II==
A mysterious guy who pretty much kept to himself, Black Condor was adamant when he first appeared that he was not a super-hero. However, time was to prove differently, and he fought the good fight alongside others, notably [[Primal Force (comics)|Primal Force]], and alone. Eventually, he went to [[Opal City]], where he felt very much at home. This Black Condor was Ryan Kendall.  This character was killed by [[Sinestro]] in an attack by the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]] in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1 after his team was sent to investigate a sighting of the Secret Society..  

There was a short lived series of the same name about this character, which was nominated for the [[Squiddy Award]] for Favorite New Series in 1992.
