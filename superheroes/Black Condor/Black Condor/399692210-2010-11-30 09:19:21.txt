'''Black Condor''' is the name of three [[fictional characters]], [[DC Comics]] superheroes who have all been members of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].<ref name="dc-free">{{Cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link = Robert Greenberger|contribution = Freedom Fighters|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 131|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> The first Black Condor, Richard Grey Jr., was originally a [[Quality Comics]] character.

==Richard Grey Jr.==
===Quality Comics===
[[Image:blackcondordcu0.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Crack Comics #26, by [[Gill Fox]]]]
A [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] mystery man who possessed the power of flight, Black Condor was a member of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], a group that operated from [[World War II]] on. '''Richard Grey, Jr.''' (alias '''Tom Wright''') was the first Black Condor. 

His story inspired by [[Tarzan]], he was born on a caravan conducting a scientific expedition through 1940's [[Mongolia]]. The caravan was later attacked by bandits and everyone was killed except for the newly born Richard. The child was rescued by a mysterious local race of super-intelligent [[Condor]]s which took in and raised the boy.

A mountain [[hermit]] named "Father Pierre" eventually discovered the boy, and with much effort eventually civilized the feral child and taught him how to speak English. Young Richard tracked down and killed the Mongolian bandits who had killed his parents and then departed for [[United States|America]] where he uncovered a plot to kill [[United States Senator]] Thomas Wright. He was too late to save Wright from assassination, and so decided to use his identity. He adopted the guise of Black Condor to fight crooked [[politicians]], [[rum-running|bootleggers]] and [[racketeering|racketeers]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book |last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link =|contribution = Black Condor I|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 51|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

===DC Comics===
In the DC Comics universe his power was [[retconned]] to being caused by exposure to a radioactive meteor. Here he met [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] and joined his group the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], and later the [[All-Star Squadron]]. 

He was among a group of Golden and Silver Age heroes who helped the JLA repel an [[Appelaxian]] invasion in the ''JLA: Year One'' mini-series by [[Mark Waid]]. He appeared more recently as an ethereal ''[[spirit guide]]'' in the pages of Ryan Kendall's Black Condor series.

==Ryan Kendall==

The second Black Condor, '''Ryan Kendall''', derived his powers of flight, telekinesis, and healing from the genetic experiments of his grandfather, Creighton. A member of an organization called the Society of the Golden Wing, Creighton and his allies had been attempting to create a man who could fly. After numerous attempts, Kendall was the only success. Kendall eventually rebelled and escaped from his grandfather, who made frequent attempts to recapture the youth in order to study and reproduce his abilities.<ref name="dc-ency1">{{Cite book|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Black Condor II|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 51|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

A mysterious telekinetic who kept to himself, Ryan Kendall was adamant when he first appeared as the Black Condor that he was not a super-hero. However, time was to prove differently, and he fought alongside other super-heroes, notably [[Primal Force]] and the [[Justice League]]<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer =|Artist =|Story =|Title = Newstime|Volume =|Issue =|Date = May, 1993|Publisher = DC Comics|Page = 23|Panel =|ID =}}</ref> (for a brief time). Eventually, he went to [[Opal City]], where he felt very much at home.

In his solo adventures, Kendall sought out [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] in hopes of gaining insight into the role of a superhero. He helps in his battle against Karen Ramis, the Post-Zero Hour [[Lion-Mane]].<ref>''Hawkman'' (third series) #20.</ref>

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1, Kendall, as part of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] was killed by a powerful beam fired by [[Sinestro]] in an ambush by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref name="dc-ency1"/>

In ''[[Nightwing]]'' #140, a mystery villain was shown to have stole the corpse of Ryan Kendall and later showed up wearing his arms and wings.{{clear}}

In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Ryan was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].

==John Trujillo==
[[Image:blackcondordcu1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|John Trujillo the new Black Condor.  Art by [[Daniel Acuña]]]]
''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #3 introduced a new Black Condor named John Trujillo whose home turf is the Arizona desert. John was given the hereditary powers of the Black Condor by '''Tocotl''' a [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] Spider Goddess.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/FreedomFighters/03/USFF03_Pre.html|title=Previewing ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #3...|accessdate=2007-06-21|author=Jimmy Palmiotti|date=2006-09-21|publisher=Newsarama |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507101813/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/FreedomFighters/03/USFF03_Pre.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthlife.net/chelicerata/myth-tar.html|title=Some Tarantula Myths|accessdate=2007-06-21|author=Gordon Ramel|date=2007-02-27|publisher=Earth-Life Web Productions}}</ref>

Trujillo sees himself as a protector of the universe.  He first appears when he single handedly rescues Uncle Sam and the other Freedom Fighters who had been defeated by agents of [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#S.H.A.D.E.|S.H.A.D.E.]].  Trujillo is very serious and seems somewhat uncomfortable interacting with other people.

In issue #6, he rebuffs romantic overtures by the Phantom Lady, correctly (as she realizes later) assuming she doesn't really mean it.

The full extent of the new Black Condor's powers remains unrevealed. He can fly at extremely high speeds, control the winds, and may possess moderate superhuman strength.

==Powers and abilities==
*The first Black Condor possessed the power of flight which he had somehow absorbed from the race of super-intelligent Condors who had raised him (later [[retcon]]ned to being the result of exposure to a radioactive [[meteorite]]). He also carried a "black light" pistol.
*The second Black Condor possessed a talent for [[Telekinesis]] which he also used to fly, as well as limited empathic abilities and a rapid healing rate.
*The third Black Condor has so far only demonstrated the abilities of flight and wind/air-current control, but has been credited by Tocotl as an elemental of the sky and the earth. He is extremely strong, fast and seems quite ruthless.

==Other versions==
*In a Silver Age story, [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] shows Superman a gender-reversed Justice League. Amongst its members are Black Condor, a male equivalent to [[Black Canary]].<ref>'' [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', volume 1, #349 (in a story entitled "The Turnabout Trap!")</ref>

*In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-10". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-X, including the Quality characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but a character visually similar to the Richard Grey, Jr. Black Condor appears.<ref>
