'''Black Condor''' is the super hero name used by three different [[fictional characters]], in the [[DC Comics]] universe. All three incarnations of Black Condor have been members of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].<ref name="dc-free">{{Cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link = Robert Greenberger|contribution = Freedom Fighters|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 131|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> A version of the Black Condor was featured in each of the Freedom Fighter series published by DC Comics.

The first Black Condor, Richard Grey Jr., was created by [[Quality Comics]] writer  [[Will Eisner]] and artist [[Lou Fine]]. He moved to the DC universe when DC Comics bought the rights to Quality Comics characters. The first Black Condor was a [[World War II]] era super hero along with the rest of the Freedom Fighters. The second Black Condor, Ryan Kendall, gained the power of flight due to genetic manipulation and initially did not believe he was a super hero. He would later join the Freedom Fighters, but was killed at the beginning of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. The third Black Condor, John Trujillo, is of Mayan descent and was given his powers by the [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] Spider Goddess Tocotl. Seeing himself as a protector of the universe he joins forces with the Freedom Fighters.

==Fictional character biography==

===Richard Grey Jr.===

====Quality Comics====
[[Image:blackcondordcu0.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Crack Comics #26, by [[Gill Fox]]]]
A [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superhero who possessed the power of flight, the Black Condor was created by writer [[Will Eisner]] under the pseudonym Kenneth Lewis, and artist [[Lou Fine]] in ''[[Crack Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d May 1940).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/794/ ''Crack Comics] #1] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> Initially alternating with the [[Clock (comics)|Clock]] as the cover-featured character, he became the solo cover feature from issues #20-26 (Jan.-Nov. 1942). His feature continued to run through issue #31.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/157/ ''Crack Comics'' (Quality Comics, 1940 Series] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

As an infant traveling with his parents on an archaeological expedition thorough Outer Mongolia, Richard Grey Jr. survived after his family was killed by the bandit Gali Kan and his men. Rescued by a [[condor]] who raised him as her own, he learned to fly, as the origin story stated, by "studying the movement of wings, the body motions, air currents, balance and levitation" of his avian siblings. A mountain [[hermit]], Father Pierre, eventually discovered and civilized the feral child, and taught him to speak English. Richard tracked down and killed the Mongolian bandits who had killed his parents and then departed for the United States where he uncovered a plot to kill [[United States Senator]] Thomas Wright. He was too late to save Wright from assassination, and so began to use his identity.<ref name=toon-blackcondor>[http://toonopedia.com/blcondr1.htm The Black Condor] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

====DC Comics====
In the DC Comics universe his power was [[retconned]] to being caused by exposure to a radioactive meteor. Here he met [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] and joined his group the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], and later the [[All-Star Squadron]].

He was among a group of Golden and Silver Age heroes who helped the JLA repel an [[Appellaxian]] invasion in the ''JLA: Year One'' mini-series by [[Mark Waid]]. He appeared more recently as an ethereal ''[[spirit guide]]'' in the pages of Ryan Kendall's Black Condor series.

===Ryan Kendall===
[[Image:Blackcondor russheath.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Black Condor #1, cover by [[Rags Morales]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/51297/ Black Condor #1 at the Grand Comics Database]</ref>]] 
The second Black Condor, '''Ryan Kendall''', derived his powers of flight, telekinesis, and healing from the genetic experiments of his grandfather, Creighton. A member of an organization called the Society of the Golden Wing, Creighton and his allies had been attempting to create a man who could fly. After numerous attempts, Kendall was the only success. Kendall eventually rebelled and escaped from his grandfather, who made frequent attempts to recapture the youth in order to study and reproduce his abilities.<ref name="dc-ency1">{{Cite book|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Black Condor II|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 51|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

A mysterious telekinetic who kept to himself, Ryan Kendall was adamant when he first appeared as the Black Condor that he was not a super-hero. However, time proved him wrong, and he fought alongside other super-heroes, notably [[Primal Force]] and the [[Justice League]]<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer =|Artist =|Story =|Title = Newstime|Volume =|Issue =|Date = May, 1993|Publisher = DC Comics|Page = 23|Panel =|ID =}}</ref> (for a brief time). Eventually, he went to [[Opal City]], where he felt very much at home.

In his solo adventures, Kendall sought out [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] in hopes of gaining insight into the role of a superhero. He helps in his battle against Karen Ramis, the Post-Zero Hour [[Lion-Mane]].<ref>''Hawkman'' (third series) #20.</ref>

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #1, Kendall, as part of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], was killed by a powerful beam fired by [[Sinestro]] in an ambush by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref name="dc-ency1"/>

In ''[[Nightwing]]'' #140, a mystery villain, Creighton Kendall who gave him his powers, resurfaces in an attempt to resurrect his evil Golden Wing Society; an organization that would dispense "justice" from the skies. {{clear}}

In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Ryan was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].

===John Trujillo===
[[Image:blackcondordcu1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|John Trujillo, the new Black Condor.  Art by [[Daniel Acuña]]]]
''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #3 introduced a new Black Condor named John Trujillo whose home turf is the Arizona desert. John was given the hereditary powers of the Black Condor by '''Tocotl''', a [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] Spider Goddess.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/FreedomFighters/03/USFF03_Pre.html|title=Previewing ''Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters'' #3...|accessdate=2007-06-21|author=Jimmy Palmiotti|date=2006-09-21|publisher=Newsarama |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070507101813/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/FreedomFighters/03/USFF03_Pre.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-07}}</ref>

Trujillo sees himself as a protector of the universe.  He first appears when he single handedly rescues Uncle Sam and the other Freedom Fighters who had been defeated by agents of [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#S.H.A.D.E.|S.H.A.D.E.]].  Trujillo is very serious and seems somewhat uncomfortable interacting with other people.

In issue #6, he rebuffs romantic overtures by the Phantom Lady, correctly (as she realizes later) assuming she does not really mean it.

The full extent of the new Black Condor's powers remains unrevealed. He can fly at extremely high speeds, control the winds, and may possess moderate superhuman strength and speed.

==Powers and abilities==
*The first Black Condor has the mutant ability to fly, although no limits are known as to speed, duration or altitude. Sometime after arriving on Earth-X, it became apparent that his mutant powers also included limited telepathic abilities, most notably mind-over-matter. At times, the Black Condor carries a ray gun, the origin of which is unknown. When used, it fires a black force beam of adjustable power capable of stunning a man or breaking a brick wall. He is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and an Olympic level athlete
*The second Black Condor possessed a talent for [[Telekinesis]] which he also used to fly, as well as limited empathic abilities and a rapid healing rate.
*The third Black Condor has so far only demonstrated the abilities of flight and wind/air-current control, but has been credited by Tocotl as an elemental of the sky and the earth. He also has a moderate level of superhuman strength and speed, and seems quite ruthless.

==Other versions==
*In a [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] story, [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] shows Superman a gender-reversed Justice League. Amongst its members are Black Condor, a male equivalent to [[Black Canary]].<ref>'' [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', volume 1, #349 (in a story entitled "The Turnabout Trap!")</ref>
*In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-10". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-X, including the Quality characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but a character visually similar to the Richard Grey, Jr. Black Condor appears.<ref>
