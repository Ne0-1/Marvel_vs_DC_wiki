'''Icicle''' is the name of 2 fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s.

==Icicle I==
A villain of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] who often encountered the masked mystery men of the [[1940's]], Dr. Joar Mahkent used a cold-producing gun as his weapon. He joined the [[Injustice Society]] and died during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

==Icicle II==
Unlike his father, Cameron Mahkent has no need for a 'cold gun', as he has somehow internalized the ability to freeze objects and people or to lower the temperature of a room or other area. This ability unintentionally gave his skin an albino pigment. Cameron became the second Icicle shortly before joining the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard's]] [[Injustice Unlimited]] group, who fought both the [[Global Guardians]] and [[Infinity, Inc.]] After he engaged in battle against the [[Star-Spangled Kid]], [[Stripesy|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], he joined the new Injustice Society at the invitation of [[Johnny Sorrow]], who released him from his prison cell. Cameron dosen't care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not because of legacy, but because he's not a nice guy. He is a far more ruthless foe than his predecessor.
