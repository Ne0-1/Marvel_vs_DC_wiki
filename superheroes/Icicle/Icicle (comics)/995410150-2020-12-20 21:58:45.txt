==Fictional character biographies==
===Dr. Joar Mahkent===
When noted European physicist '''Dr. Joar Mahkent''' arrived in America with his latest scientific discovery, spectators at dockside were astonished to witness the luxury liner upon which Mahkent was traveling suddenly frozen solid in [[Gotham City|Gotham]] Harbor. Investigating this phenomenon, the original [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]) was shocked by the sight of Dr. Mahkent shot dead in his stateroom, apparently the victim of Lanky Leeds, a notorious racketeer who was reportedly traveling on the same ship. Thus, when the bizarrely costumed criminal known as the Icicle appeared upon the scene later that same day, wielding a unique weapon capable of instantly freezing solid any moisture in the air, Green Lantern presumed he was actually Lanky Leeds, who had stolen Doctor Mahkent's invention. After several frustrating encounters, Green Lantern ultimately unmasked the Icicle as Joar Mahkent himself, who had, in fact, murdered Lanky Leeds, using his cold ray gun to temporarily disguise Leeds' face as his own. Attempting to escape from Green Lantern, the Icicle leaped off a 20-story building and apparently plunged to his death in the Gotham River far below.<ref>''All American Comics'' #90. DC Comics.</ref>

Actually, the Icicle survived his fall into the river, and returned to plague the Emerald Gladiator time and time again, eventually becoming a member of [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]'s second [[Injustice Society|Injustice Society of the World]] which succeeded in briefly hypnotizing the [[Justice Society of America]]. During their Patriotic Crimes, the Icicle stole the [[Washington Monument]]. Later he was a founding member of the [[Crime Champions|Crime Champions of Two Earths]], along with the Wizard and the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]], which teamed up with a trio of crooks from Earth-1 after the Fiddler accidentally discovered a way to travel between worlds. The Icicle committed a million-dollar robbery on Earth-2 and escaped [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Hourman]] and [[Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)|Doctor Fate]]. He was defeated by Doctor Fate while robbing a museum on Earth-1. The [[Justice League]] and the Justice Society were captured and imprisoned in cages in space by the Crime Champions though, but escaped with the help of the [[Green Lantern]]s. All the villains were then captured.

The Icicle met his death during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', when he and several other [[supervillain]]s attempted to invade the laboratory of the renegade [[Oa]]n known as [[Krona (comics)|Krona]].

The storyline ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' revealed that, as young children, Bruce Wayne and [[Hush (comics)|Thomas Elliot]] witnessed a fight between Alan Scott and the Icicle during a visit in Metropolis, which inspired both of them to consider the importance of the tactical expertise that they would use in their future costumed careers.

Joar Mahkent has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].

===Cameron Mahkent===
'''Cameron Mahkent''' has no need for a 'cold gun', as his father's prolonged exposure to the weapon altered his genetics, allowing him to biologically pass down to his son the ability to freeze objects and people or to lower the temperature of a room or other area. Cameron's skin pigmentation was also affected, making him appear to be albino.<ref>''Infinity Inc. #34. DC Comics.</ref>

Cameron became the second Icicle shortly before joining the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard's]] [[Injustice Unlimited]] group. It was during the period of the DC mini-series ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' (1986), the people of America were turned against their heroes, and a law was made that no one could operate as a crimefighter legally wearing a costume. This did not affect the villains much, as they were already breaking the law. For the new Icicle, it proved an opportune time to join with other super-criminals. He joined the Wizard in his new Injustice Society – called '''Injustice Unlimited'''. The group overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]... namely [[Infinity, Inc.]] and a contingent of the [[Global Guardians]] and forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. The Icicle was given the mission of finding and retrieving the man-monster called [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. He took with him the still hypnotized [[Icemaiden]] and [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] and they traveled to the [[Arctic Circle]]. They were successful in the mission and brought back the white behemoth to Calgary, just in time to interfere with the escape plans of the Wizard. The plan of blackmailing the wealthy businessmen went haywire when [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]] (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself. In the confusion of the battle, however, Cameron was able to escape.<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' #35-37 (1987). DC Comics.</ref>

Only weeks later he again joined with [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Artemis]] and [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], as well as the new [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]], the [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]] and Solomon Grundy. The Dummy wanted to head a revived Injustice Unlimited and planned to murder the members of Infinity Inc. to make a name for themselves. Their first target - [[Skyman]] - was successfully killed by the Harlequin and then Icicle went after [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave Jr]]. After believing the mental mutant dead the Icicle returned to his cohorts. A plan was hatched to bring all the remaining Infinitors to Stellar Studios and kill them, a plan defeated only by the unwillingness of Hazard to cooperate, and the sudden reappearance of Brainwave Jr. and Jade (both of whom had been thought dead). The Icicle nearly killed Brainwave Jr. in hand-to-hand combat but was knocked out by Jade. In the end Cameron was given over to law enforcement.<ref>''Infinity Inc'' #51-53 (1988). DC Comics.</ref>

Later, after he engaged in battle against the second [[Courtney Whitmore|Star-Spangled Kid]], [[Stripesy|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], he joined the new Injustice Society at the invitation of [[Johnny Sorrow]], who released him from his prison cell. During ''Stealing Thunder'', when the [[Ultra-Humanite]] remade the world after acquiring control of [[Johnny Thunder]]'s Thunderbolt, he was forced to help the 'reserve JSA'- consisting of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Hourman, the third [[Crimson Avenger]], [[Power Girl]], [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]] and [[Jakeem Thunder]]- against the Ultra-Humanite, since they were the only other people free in the world created by the Ultra-Humanite. He was later offered a position in the JSA by Sand but turned him down saying that he only fought with Sand for his own reasons.

Cameron does not care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not because of legacy, but because he's not a nice guy. He is a far more ruthless foe than his predecessor. He has begun a relationship with his teammate, the [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]].

As part of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc, the Icicle is part of a multi-villain attack on [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] in [[Washington D.C.]]. Despite working with other cold themed villains such as [[Killer Frost]] and [[Captain Cold]] and having the backing of President [[Lex Luthor]], the Icicle and all the villains are soundly defeated.

During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Cameron popped up as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

[[One Year Later]], he is approached by [[Mirror Master]] to join the [[Suicide Squad]] for a mission.

On the cover of ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #13 (Vol. 2), it shows Icicle as a member of the new [[Injustice League]], though this was not corroborated by the story.

He can seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

Icicle and Tigress appear in the "[[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]] and [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]]" Second Feature in ''[[JSA All Stars]]''. The story involves them alternately working with and against the heroic couple in a quest to locate a magical artifact. He and [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]] are expecting a baby, which appears to threaten Tigress' health. Icicle is trying to 'raise' money for expensive treatments.<ref>''JSA 8--Page Giant 2011''. DC Comics.</ref>

In 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. The [[Green Team (comics)|Green Team]] encountered Icicle on a meteor which he hijacked from Bellachek Temple to give to his client. He begins to attack the Green Team by freezing their shuttle.<ref>''Green Team: Teen Trillionaires'' #5. DC Comics.</ref> As Icicle continues his attack, he kills Paul who recognizes Icicle as Cameron. Icicle continues the attack until the meteor breaks into different fragments.<ref>''Green Team: Teen Trillionaires'' #6. DC Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* The ''[[Super Friends]]'' version of Icicle appeared in the "Post Super Heroes Create a Villain Contest" cereal commercial from the 1980s. Robin says "Holy Icicles!" and then Icicle shoots his freeze ray, but [[Superman]] deflects it right back at him with hands.

* A character based on Icicle appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series: '''Dr. Blizzard''' (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]). In the episode "Legends", he is a member of the [[Injustice Society|Injustice Guild]].

* Both versions of Icicle appear on ''[[Smallville]]'' in the two-part episode "[[Absolute Justice]]": Cameron Mahkent (played by [[Wesley MacInnes]]) and Joar Mahkent (played by Gardiner Millar). Cameron is responsible for the death of the [[Star-Spangled Kid]]/[[Sylvester Pemberton]] and [[Sandman (DC Comics)|Sandman]] under [[Amanda Waller]]'s orders. After killing [[Doctor Fate]], Cameron went to see the bed-ridden vegetative Joar. After revealing his plans, he pulled the plug on his father before donning Doctor Fate's [[Nabu (comics)|helmet]]. Crashing into the [[Watchtower]], he started a fight with [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]], [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Green Arrow]] before being attacked by the repowered [[Martian Manhunter]]. Due to the Martian Manhunter's ability to phase through objects, Cameron's powers were useless and the members of the JSA and [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]] defeated Cameron. Hawkman delivered the finishing blow with the mace, knocking Fate's helmet off and returning Cameron to normal. Cameron was subsequently imprisoned in a heated room in [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] facility. There, Waller revealed that his attacks against the JSA had accomplished exactly what she had intended—bringing the team back together, part of a plan to save the world from "a coming apocalypse". When Cameron protested that this was not what he had signed up for, Waller shot and apparently killed him, as a "welcome" to the [[Suicide Squad]].

* Both versions of Icicle appear in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series with Cameron Mahkent (called Icicle Jr.) voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Kevin |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/comic-con-2010-young-justice |title=Comic-Con 2010: Young Justice |publisher=UGO.com |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2014-07-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110030615/http://www.ugo.com/tv/comic-con-2010-young-justice |archive-date=November 10, 2013 }}</ref> and Joar Mahkent voiced by [[James Remar]]. Cameron first appeared in "Independence Day" is shown causing havoc on a bridge in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] until he is taken down by Green Arrow and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]]. In "Terrors", Joar appears where he, his son, and the ice-based villains ([[Killer Frost]], [[Captain Cold]] and [[Mr. Freeze]]) specifically plan to start a breakout in Belle Reve. Icicle Jr. mentions to the disguised [[Conner Kent|Superboy]] that his father acts as a jerk to him. Once the breakout and takeover has been done, Icicle Sr. has his son and Superboy had to break through the walls to the Women's side. Superboy convinces Icicle Jr. to "show some initiative". During this time, Icicle Jr. unwittingly aids Superboy and even helps fight off several villains, including starting a fight with Mr. Freeze. Shortly after, he discovers who Superboy really is and states "dad's gonna kill me". It turns out that Icicle Sr. was in cahoots with [[Hugo Strange]] as both are shown to be associated with [[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Light]] ([[Project Cadmus]]' Board of Directors). In "Beneath", Icicle Jr. appears in Bialya with [[Psimon]], [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]], [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]], and [[Devastation (comics)|Devastation]] where they assigned to guard a shipment of children to [[Reach (comics)|The Light's partner]].

Before Icicle can kill, Psimon is defeated by [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], allowing Miss Martian to defend herself by hurling Icicle Jr. into a wall. He is later seen at the end of the episode relatively unharmed. In "Darkest", Icicle Jr. is sent with Aqualad, Tigress, and the Terror Twins on a mission to attack Impulse and Blue Beetle. He manages to freeze Blue Beetle until he breaks free. When the Blue Beetle scarab takes control, he manages to knock down Icicle until Aqualad and Tigress subdue Blue Beetle. Icicle Jr. joins Aqualad, Tigress, and the Terror Twins into retreating back to Black Manta.

* Icicle appears in ''[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special]]'', voiced by [[Tom Root]].

* A variation unrelated to any of the comics' iterations appears in [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]] of [[The CW]]'s live-action series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Kyle Secor]]. This version is '''Dr. Thomas Snow''', the father of [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]]. The first half of season five sees Caitlin looking for her father, who had supposedly died 20 years earlier, after discovering that his death certificate was faked. In the episode "The Icicle Cometh", Caitlin, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|the Flash]], and [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] find Thomas and learn that he was attempting to find a cure for his and Caitlin's [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] gene, which resulted in them both getting ice powers. However, he claimed that unlike his daughter, who developed a split personality called "Killer Frost", he never developed one and is dying; with a serum based on Caitlin's D.N.A. being the only cure. Eventually, it is discovered that he did develop an alternate personality, later dubbed "Icicle", who was in control of Thomas's body the entire time and that he needed the serum to kill his other self. Icicle's plan is foiled when Killer Frost reemerges and destroys the serum, forcing him to flee. Icicle returns in the episode "Snow Pack", intending to eliminate Caitlin and her mother Carla's human sides. Just as Icicle is about to kill Caitlin, Thomas suddenly finds the strength to return to his human form. When Caitlin is attacked by the supervillain [[Cicada (comics)|Cicada]], Thomas sacrifices himself to save Caitlin and dies in her arms.

* A version of Joar Mahkent named '''Jordan Mahkent''' appears in the [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series ''[[Stargirl (TV series)|Stargirl]]'', portrayed by [[Neil Jackson]].

In the years since, he settled down in Blue Valley as a businessman in his civilian identity and became the founder of Blue Valley business, The American Dream. In the episode "S.T.R.I.P.E.", Icicle meets with Injustice Society member [[Gambler (comics)|Steven Sharpe]] to discuss the rise of Starman's successor, [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]]. In his self-titled episode, Icicle engaged Stargirl and [[Pat Dugan|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] in battle, which led to the murder of fellow ISA member [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]]'s son. When Icicle's associate confronted him about what happened, he froze him. In the episode "The Justice Society," Icicle meets with the ISA to determine how to handle Stargirl after she starts rebuilding the JSA. In the two-part season one finale, "Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.", Icicle leads the ISA in enacting "Project: New America", but Stargirl's JSA foil their plans. After sustaining damage while fighting her and S.T.R.I.P.E., Icicle was shattered by Mike Dugan using his dad's truck.
