'''Icicle''' is the name of two fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s.

==Dr. Joar Mahkent==
When noted European physicist Dr. Joar Mahkent arrived in America with his latest scientific discovery, spectators at dockside were astonished to witness the luxury liner upon which Makent was traveling suddenly frozen solid in [[Gotham]] Harbor.  

Investigating this phenomenon, the original [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]) was shocked by the sight of Dr. Mahkent shot dead in his stateroom, apparently the victim of Lanky Leeds, a notorious racketeer who was reportedly traveling on the same ship. Thus, when the bizarrely costumed criminal known as the Icicle appeared upon the scene later that same day, wielding a unique weapon capable of instantly freezing solid any moisture in the air, Green Lantern presumed he was actually Lanky Leeds, who had stolen Dr. Mahkent's invention.

After several frustrating encounters, Green Lantern ultimately unmasked the Icicle as Joar Mahkent himself, who had, in fact, murdered Lanky Leeds, using his cold ray gun to temporarily disguise Leed's face as his own. Attempting to escape from Green Lantern, the Icicle leaped off a 20-story building and apparently plunged to his death in the Gotham River far below.

Actually, the Icicle survived his fall into the river, and returned to plague the Emerald Gladiator time and again, eventually becoming a member of [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]'s second [[Injustice Society of the World]] and, later a founding member of the [[Crime Champions of Two Earths]].

The Icicle met his death during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], when he and several other [[super-villain]]s attempted to invade the laboratory of the renegade [[Oa]]n known as [[Krona (comics)|Krona]].

==Cameron Mahkent==
Unlike his father, '''Cameron Mahkent''' has no need for a 'cold gun', as he has somehow internalized the ability to freeze objects and people or to lower the temperature of a room or other area. This ability unintentionally gave his skin an albino pigment.

Cameron became the second Icicle shortly before joining the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard's]] [[Injustice Unlimited]] group.  It was during the period of the DC mini-series ''Legends'' (1986), the people of America were turned against heroes, and law was made that no one could operate legally wearing a costume.  This did not affect the villains much, as they were already breaking the law.  For the new Icicle it proved an opportune time to join with other super-criminals.  He joined the Wizard in his new Injustice Society â€“ called '''Injustice Unlimited'''.  The group overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in Calgary, Canada... namely [[Infinity, Inc.]] and a contingent of the [[Global Guardians]] and forced the heroes to help in some mayhem.  The Icicle was given the mission of finding and retrieving the man-monster called [[Solomon Grundy]].  He took with him the still hypnotized [[Icemaiden]] and [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] and they traveled to the Arctic Circle.  They were successful in the mission and brought back the white behemoth to Calgary, just in time to interfere with the escape plans of the Wizard.  The plan of blackmailing the wealthy businessmen went haywire when [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]] (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself.  In the confusion of the battle, however, Cameron was able to escape.  (Infinity Inc 35-37 1987)

Only weeks later he again joined with Artemis and Hazard, as well as the new Harlequin, the Dummy and Solomon Grundy.  The Dummy wanted to head a revived Injustice Unlimited and planned to murder the members of Inifinity Inc to make a name for themselves.  Their first target - Skyman - was successfully killed by the Harelquin and then Icicle went after Brainwave Jr.  After believing the mental mutant dead the Icicle returned to his cohorts.  A plan was hatched to bring all the remaining Infinitors to Stellar Studios and kill them, a plan defeated only by the unwillingness of Hazard to cooperate, and the sudden reappearance of Brainwave Jr and Jade (both who had been thought dead).  The Icicle nearly killed Brainwave Jr in hand to hand combat but was knocked out by Jade.  In the end Cameron was given over to law enforcement. (Infinity Inc 51-53, 1988) 

Later, after he engaged in battle against the [[Star-Spangled Kid]], [[Stripesy|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], he joined the new Injustice Society at the invitation of [[Johnny Sorrow]], who released him from his prison cell. During ''Stealing Thunder'', when the [[Ultra-Humanite]] remade the world after acquiring control of [[Johnny Thunder]]'s Thunderbolt, he was forced to help the 'reserve JSA'- consisting of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Hourman, the third [[Crimson Avenger]], [[Power Girl]], [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]] and [[Jakeem Thunder]]- against the Ultra-Humanite, since they were the only other people free in the world created by the Ultra-Humanite.

Cameron doesn't care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not because of legacy, but because he's not a nice guy. He is a far more ruthless foe than his predecessor. He has recently begun a relationship with his teammate, the [[Artemis Crock|Tigress]].

[[One Year Later]], he was approached by [[Mirror Master]] to join the [[Suicide Squad]] for a mission.
On the cover of ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #13 (Vol.2), it shows Icicle as a member of the new [[Injustice League]].

==Other media==

The [[Super Friends]] version of Icicle appeared in the "Post Super Heroes Create A Villain Contest" cereal commercial from the 1980s. Robin says "Holy Icicles!" And then Icicle shoots his freeze ray, but Superman deflects it right back at him with his hands.

*Dr. Blizzard, a character based on Icicle, appeared in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Legends." He was voiced by [[Corey Burton]].

*The Joar Markhent version appears along with other cold based villains in Justice League Adventures #12.
