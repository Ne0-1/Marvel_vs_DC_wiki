==Fictional character biographies==
===Dr. Joar Mahkent===
When noted European physicist '''Dr. Joar Mahkent''' arrived in America with his latest scientific discovery, spectators at dockside were astonished to witness the luxury liner upon which Mahkent was traveling suddenly frozen solid in [[Gotham City|Gotham]] Harbor.

Investigating this phenomenon, the original [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]) was shocked by the sight of Dr. Mahkent shot dead in his stateroom, apparently the victim of Lanky Leeds, a notorious racketeer who was reportedly traveling on the same ship. Thus, when the bizarrely costumed criminal known as the Icicle appeared upon the scene later that same day, wielding a unique weapon capable of instantly freezing solid any moisture in the air, Green Lantern presumed he was actually Lanky Leeds, who had stolen Doctor Mahkent's invention.

After several frustrating encounters, Green Lantern ultimately unmasked the Icicle as Joar Mahkent himself, who had, in fact, murdered Lanky Leeds, using his cold ray gun to temporarily disguise Leeds' face as his own. Attempting to escape from Green Lantern, the Icicle leaped off a 20-story building and apparently plunged to his death in the Gotham River far below.

Actually, the Icicle survived his fall into the river, and returned to plague the Emerald Gladiator time and time again, eventually becoming a member of [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]'s second [[Injustice Society|Injustice Society of the World]] which succeeded in briefly hypnotizing the JSA. During their Patriotic Crimes, the Icicle stole the [[Washington Monument]]. Later he was a founding member of the [[Crime Champions|Crime Champions of Two Earths]], along with the Wizard and the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]], which teamed up with a trio of crooks from Earth-1 after the Fiddler accidentally discovered a way to travel between worlds. The Icicle committed a million-dollar robbery on Earth-2 and escaped [[Hourman]] and [[Doctor Fate]]. He was defeated by Doctor Fate while robbing a museum on Earth-1. The JLA and JSA were captured and imprisoned in cages in space by the Crime Champions though, but escaped with the help of the [[Green Lantern]]s. All the villains were then captured.

The Icicle met his death during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', when he and several other [[supervillain]]s attempted to invade the laboratory of the renegade [[Oa]]n known as [[Krona (comics)|Krona]].

In the storyline ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' is revealed that as young children, Bruce Wayne and [[Hush (comics)|Thomas Elliot]] witnessed a fight between Alan Scott and the Icicle during a visit in Metropolis.

Joar Mahkent has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].

===Cameron Mahkent===
'''Cameron Mahkent''' has no need for a 'cold gun', as his father's prolonged exposure to the weapon altered his genetics, allowing him to biologically pass down to his son the ability to freeze objects and people or to lower the temperature of a room or other area. Cameron's skin pigmentation was also affected, making him appear to be albino.

Cameron became the second Icicle shortly before joining the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard's]] [[Injustice Unlimited]] group.  It was during the period of the DC mini-series ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' (1986), the people of America were turned against their heroes, and a law was made that no one could operate legally wearing a costume. This did not affect the villains much, as they were already breaking the law. For the new Icicle it proved an opportune time to join with other super-criminals. He joined the Wizard in his new Injustice Society – called '''Injustice Unlimited'''. The group overcame the security at the International Trade Conference in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]... namely [[Infinity, Inc.]] and a contingent of the [[Global Guardians]] and forced the heroes to help in some mayhem. The Icicle was given the mission of finding and retrieving the man-monster called [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. He took with him the still hypnotized [[Icemaiden]] and [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] and they traveled to the [[Arctic Circle]]. They were successful in the mission and brought back the white behemoth to Calgary, just in time to interfere with the escape plans of the Wizard. The plan of blackmailing the wealthy businessmen went haywire when [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]] (Rick Tyler) revived and freed himself. In the confusion of the battle, however, Cameron was able to escape. (Infinity Inc 35-37 1987)

Only weeks later he again joined with [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Artemis]] and [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], as well as the new [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]], the [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]] and Solomon Grundy.  The Dummy wanted to head a revived Injustice Unlimited and planned to murder the members of Infinity Inc. to make a name for themselves. Their first target - [[Skyman]] - was successfully killed by the Harlequin and then Icicle went after [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave Jr]]. After believing the mental mutant dead the Icicle returned to his cohorts. A plan was hatched to bring all the remaining Infinitors to Stellar Studios and kill them, a plan defeated only by the unwillingness of Hazard to cooperate, and the sudden reappearance of Brainwave Jr. and Jade (both who had been thought dead). The Icicle nearly killed Brainwave Jr. in hand-to-hand combat but was knocked out by Jade. In the end Cameron was given over to law enforcement. (Infinity Inc 51-53, 1988)

Later, after he engaged in battle against the second [[Courtney Whitmore|Star-Spangled Kid]], [[Stripesy|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], he joined the new Injustice Society at the invitation of [[Johnny Sorrow]], who released him from his prison cell. During ''Stealing Thunder'', when the [[Ultra-Humanite]] remade the world after acquiring control of [[Johnny Thunder]]'s Thunderbolt, he was forced to help the 'reserve JSA'- consisting of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Hourman, the third [[Crimson Avenger]], [[Power Girl]], [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]] and [[Jakeem Thunder]]- against the Ultra-Humanite, since they were the only other people free in the world created by the Ultra-Humanite.  He was later offered a position in the JSA by Sand but turned him down saying that he only fought with him for his reasons.

Cameron does not care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not because of legacy, but because he's not a nice guy. He is a far more ruthless foe than his predecessor. He has begun a relationship with his teammate, the [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]].

As part of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' "Public Enemies" arc, the Icicle is part of a multi-villain attack on [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] in [[Washington D.C.]]. Despite working with other cold themed villains such as [[Killer Frost]] and [[Captain Cold]] and having the backing of the villains President [[Lex Luthor]], the Icicle and all the villains are soundly defeated.

During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Cameron popped up as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

[[One Year Later]], he is approached by [[Mirror Master]] to join the [[Suicide Squad]] for a mission.

On the cover of ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #13 (Vol. 2), it shows Icicle as a member of the new [[Injustice League]], though this was not corroborated by the story.

He can seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

Icicle and Tigress appear in the "[[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]] and [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]]" Second Feature in ''[[JSA All Stars]]''. The story involves them alternately working with and against the heroic couple in a quest to locate a magical artifact. He and [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]] are expecting a baby, which appears to threaten Tigress' health. Icicle is trying to 'raise' money for expensive treatments.<ref>JSA 8--Page Giant 2011</ref>

However, he claims that (unlike his daughter) he never developed a split personality and is dying as a result, with a serum based on Caitlin's D.N.A. the only cure. Eventually it is discovered that he did develop an alternate personality, later dubbed Icicle, who was in control of Thomas's body the entire time and that he needed the serum to kill his other self.
