'''Icicle''' is the name of two fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s.

==Dr. Joar Mahkent==
When noted European physicist Dr. Joar Mahkent arrived in America with his latest scientific discovery, spectators at dockside were astonished to witness the luxury liner upon which Makent was traveling suddenly frozen solid in [[Gotham]] Harbor.  

Investigating this phenomenon, the original [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]) was shocked by the sight of Dr. Mahkent shot dead in his stateroom, apparently the victim of Lanky Leeds, a notorious racketeer who was reportedly traveling on the same ship. Thus, when the bizarrely costumed criminal known as the Icicle appeared upon the scene later that same day, weilding a uniquie weapon capable of instantly freezing solid any moisture in the air, Green Lantern presumed he was actually Lanky Leeds, who had stolen Dr. Mahkent's invention.

After several frustratrating encounters, Green Lantern ultimately unmasked the Icicle as Joar Mahkent himself, who had, in fact, murdered Lanky Leeds, using his cold ray gun to temporarily disguise Leed's face as his own. Attempting to escape from Green Lantern, the Icicle leaped off a 20-story building and apparently plunged to his death in the Gotham River far below.

Actually, the Icicle survived his fall into the river, and returned to plague the Emerald Gladiator time and again, evenetually becoming a member of [[Wizard (DC Comics)|the Wizard]]'s second [[Injustice Society of the World]] and, later a founding member of the [[Crime Champions of Two Earths]].

The Icicle met his death during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], when he and several other [[super-villain|super-villains]] attempted to invade the laboratory of the renegade [[Oa]]n known as [[Krona]].

==Cameron Mahkent==
Unlike his father, '''Cameron Mahkent''' has no need for a 'cold gun', as he has somehow internalized the ability to freeze objects and people or to lower the temperature of a room or other area. This ability unintentionally gave his skin an albino pigment.Cameron became the second Icicle shortly before joining the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard's]] [[Injustice Unlimited]] group, who fought both the [[Global Guardians]] and [[Infinity, Inc.]] After he engaged in battle against the [[Star-Spangled Kid]], [[Stripesy|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], he joined the new Injustice Society at the invitation of [[Johnny Sorrow]], who released him from his prison cell. During Stealing Thunder he helped the JSA against Ultra-Humanite. Cameron doesn't care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not because of legacy, but because he's not a nice guy. He is a far more ruthless foe than his predecessor. He has recently begun a relationship with his teammate, the [[Artemis Crock|Tigress]].

[[One Year Later]], he was approached by [[Mirror Master]] to join the [[Suicide Squad]] for a mission.
