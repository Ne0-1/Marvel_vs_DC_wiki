In the [[Marvel Universe]], '''Damage Control''' is a ([[fictitious]]) construction company which specialises in repairing the property damage caused by conflicts between [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s.

Damage Control employees first appeared in [[1989]], in a serialized story published in the [[anthology]] comic ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]#19'' (although they are posited to have existed since the earliest days of widespread superhero-related property damage). Subsequently, the employees of Damage Control have been the subject of three separate [[comic book]] series (each limited to four issues), and have had frequent minor roles in many other Marvel comics.

[[Dwayne McDuffie]], who co-created the company (with artist [[Ernie Colon]]) and wrote Damage Control's initial non-adventures, has often described ''Damage Control'' as "a [[sitcom]] within the Marvel Universe".
