'''Damage Control''' is a fictional [[construction]] company appearing in [[Marvel Comics]] which specializes in repairing the property damage caused by conflicts between [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s.  Three ''Damage Control'' limited series have been published to date.

==Publication history==
Damage Control employees first appear briefly in a four-page story in 1988's ''Marvel Age Annual'' and fully in 1989 in a serialized story published in the [[anthology]] comic ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #19 (although they are posited to have existed since the earliest days of widespread superhero-related property damage). Subsequently, the employees of Damage Control have been the subject of three separate [[comic book]] [[limited series]] (each limited to four issues), published between 1989 and 1991, and have had frequent minor roles in many other Marvel comics.

[[Dwayne McDuffie]], who co-created the concept with artist [[Ernie Colon]] and wrote Damage Control's initial non-adventures, pitched ''Damage Control'' to Marvel as "a [[situation comedy|sitcom]] within the Marvel Universe". <ref>http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/Damconpitch.html Dwayne McDuffie's original pitch to Marvel Comics</ref>

===Fictional history===
Damage Control was founded by Ms. Ann-Marie Hoag and was originally owned by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], each owning half the stock of the company, though Stark felt uneasy cooperated with Fisk, a notorious criminal. 

Damage Control employees have been in the middle of a breakout at the Vault, confronted Doctor Doom, have been threatened with death by the [[Punisher]] and have met vastly powerful cosmic entities such as the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Galactus]]. They have 'fought' side by side with the [[X-Men]], socialized with the [[New Warriors]] and even were almost menaced by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].

When Ms. Hoag was offered a job in government, she nominated Robin Chapel as her replacement. Stark and Fisk sold their stock in Damage Control: Stark because he didn't want to be associated with Fisk and Fisk because he had no confidence in Robin's ability to lead the company. Another company, Carlton Co, took control of Damage Control and tried to make Damage Control more profitable, but in the process angered a lot of employees and nearly ruined Damage Control. Ms. Hoag convinced [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to invest in Damage Control and they loaned her the money to buy back the company. S.H.I.E.L.D. also found out that the sale of Damage Control had been a plot by Fisk to buy back the company for cheap. During the events of [[Acts of Vengeance]] (an event Fisk helped organize), massive damage was done to the city and Fisk made a large profit when Damage Control was hired to repair the damages.

===Damage Control: The Movie===

The confrontation with the Kingpin was the loose basis for a movie concerning the company. [[Wonder Man| Simon Williams]] played John Porter. In a decision which would haunt him throughout his career, Simon shows his rear in the movie, humiliating Porter. [[Marlon Brando]] plays the Kingpin. James Coburn plays Lenny Ballinger. [[Shelley Long]], with plenty of nude scenes, angers the woman she plays, Robin Chapel. Jimmy J.J. Walker plays Albert Cleary. Changing reality, Albert is portrayed as being from the 'ghetto' and is eventually strangled by the Kingpin. [[John Candy]] plays Eugene Strausser, technical genius and comic relief. 

At the wrap party for the premiere, the Damage Control staff is summoned by the [[Silver Surfer]] to help deal with Edifice Rex, a former employee. He had gained cosmic powers and this, combined with an anal retentive personality, threatens the cosmos. Several of the employees meet and discuss the problem with other cosmic entities, such as [[Galactus]] and Lord Chaos. Robin Chapel eventually solves this problem by firing Rex.

In a later appearance, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is seen helping Damage Control to clear up the damage after a battle in New York City.

===Civil War===

Damage Control appears again in ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' Vol. 3, #46 (September 2006), as part of Marvel's ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' event.  

In Wolverine Vol. 3, #45, the super-villain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] reveals that a "Walter Declun" is in some way behind the explosion that led to the deaths of 600 people in Stamford, Connecticut, having provided Nitro with MGH ([[Mutant Growth Hormone]]) in order to enhance his powers. Declun is identified by [[Namor]] as CEO of Damage Control, Inc.

Wolverine's investigation leads him to interrogate Anne-Marie Hoag, Damage Control's President, who reveals that Declun and his investors took a controlling share of the stock after the company went public to obtain more funds. Following the Stamford disaster, Damage Control obtained the town's reconstruction contract, as well as a contract to perform the evaluation and training of registered super-humans.

In his search for Declun, Wolverine engages in a fight with Damage Control guards, who are equipped with Mandroid Armor, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weaponry, [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]] technology and other weapons and equipment salvaged from superhuman fights. Wolverine defeats them with the aid of two members of the Atlantean Royal Guard.

Having survived his confrontation with the Damage Control forces and then escaped from S.H.I.E.L.D. imprisonment, Wolverine confronts Declun, who had just been fired by Hoag. Wolverine soon kills Declun.

Hercules works on construction and demolition.
*Robin Chapel: Traffic manager and Ms. Hoag's most trusted employee. She had a rivalry with John Porter, when he was hired, because she applied for his position within Damage Control.
