'''Mangog''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #154 (July, 1968) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Publication history==
Mangog first appears in a multi-issue storyline in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', and is depicted as being the sum total of the hatred of a billion billion beings that were once killed by the ruler of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] Gods, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]. Imprisoned beneath Asgard, Mangog is accidentally freed by the Rock Troll [[Ulik]]. Mangog storms Asgard, intent on drawing the [[Odinsword]] from its [[scabbard]], which will end the [[universe]]. Odin' son, the Thunder God ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', battles Mangog to a standstill until Odin defeats Mangog by restoring the race he slew to life, which reduces the creature to a diminutive size.<ref>''Thor''  #154 - 157 (July - Oct. 1968)</ref> 

Mangog becomes a perennial foe of Asgard, reappearing when freed by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] (defeated when cut off from the source of its' power)<ref> ''Thor'' #195 - 198 (Jan. - Apr. 1972)</ref> and aided by a traitorous [[illusionist|magician]] called Igron. On the second occasion Mangog assumes the form of an imprisoned Odin, and after slaying Igron and attempts to banish Thor's ally [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]]. After a series of skirmishes with Thor, the creature is defeated when Thor frees Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #242 (Dec. 1975); 244 (Feb. 1975) 246 - 250 (Apr. - Aug. 1976)</ref> 

The character appears in the second volume of ''Thor'' as the servant of the Titan [[Thanos]], who is seeking  universal domination. Mangog is eventually destroyed by Thor (the character places his mystic hammer ''[[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]'' in the creature's mouth and blasts it internally) and Thanos (later revealed to have been a "Thanosi" [[cloning|clone]]) was defeated.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #20 - 25 (Feb. - Jul. 2000)</ref> Later, in one of the final issues of the second volume of Thor, Mangog was again destroyed by Thor, seemingly for good.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84 (Nov. 2004)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mangog possesses the strength; endurance, and durability of an entire race, and has the ability to manipulate magic for energy projection and [[shapeshift]]ing.
