'''Mangog''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Mighty Thor]]'' #154 (July, 1968) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mangog, or "'''The Mangog'''" as it originally referred to itself, is the sum total of the hatred of a billion billion beings that were once killed by the ruler of Asgard and the Norse Gods, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]. Imprisoned deep beneath Asgard, Mangog is accidentally freed by the Rock Troll [[Ulik]]. <ref>''Thor'' #154 (Jul. 1968)</ref> Mangog then storms Asgard, intent on drawing the Odinsword from its scabbard and ending the universe. The Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] battles Mangog to a standstill until Odin defeats Mangog by restoring the race he slew to life, which reduces the creature to a diminutive size. <ref>''Thor''  #155 - 157 (Aug. - Oct. 1968)</ref> Mangog is later freed by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and is eventually banished when the connection to the hate that sustains it is broken.
<ref> ''Thor'' #195 - 198 (Jan. - Apr. 1972)</ref>

With aid of a traitorous magician called Igron, Mangog returns and assumes the form of an imprisoned Odin. As Odin, Mangog slays Igron and attempts to banish Thor's ally [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]]. After a series of battles with Thor, the creature is defeated once more when Thor frees Odin. <ref>''Thor'' #242 (Dec. 1975); 244 (Feb. 1975) 246 - 250 (Apr. - Aug. 1976)</ref> 

While usually acting independently, Mangog also assists the Titan [[Thanos]] in a quest for universal domination, but is ultimately stopped by Thor. <ref>''Thor'' #20 - 25 (Feb. - Jul. 2000)</ref> Thor eventually ends the threat of Mangog entirely: having inherited the Odin Force, Thor dissolves an attacking Mangog with a wave of his hand. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84 (Nov. 2004)</ref> Mangog, like all the Asgardian monsters, has not been seen since the destruction of Asgard. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 2004)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mangog posesses superhuman strength, agility and endurance, and is pratically invulnerable to physical harm. Mangog can also manipulate magic to shapeshift and project energy blasts.

==Other versions==
In an alternate reality, Mangog battles the [[Silver Surfer]]. <ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #51 (Jun. 1982)</ref>
