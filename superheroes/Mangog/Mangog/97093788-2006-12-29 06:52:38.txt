Mangog is a [[fictional]] character that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Mangog first appeared in ''Thor'' vol. 1, #154 (January 1968) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

'''Mangog''', or "The Mangog" as it originally referred to itself, is the sum total of the hatred of a billion billion beings that were once killed by the ruler of Asgard and the Norse Gods, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]. Imprisoned deep beneath Asgard, Mangog is accidently freed by the Rock Troll [[Ulik]], <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #154</ref> and goes on to wage war against Odin and the other Norse Gods on several occasions. Mangog proves to be physically unstoppable, and is usually only defeated by exploiting Mangog's dependence on psychic energies (such as hatred, fear, or feelings of devotion) felt by other sentient beings to sustain itself. Without such a source, Mangog shrinks to near nothingness. <ref>As seen in ''Thor'' vol. 1, #157, 198</ref>

While usually acting independently, Mangog also assists the titan [[Thanos]] in a quest for universal domination, but is ultimately stopped by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #20 - 25</ref> Thor eventually ends the threat of Mangog entirely - having evolved into an all-powerful deity, Thor simply dissolves an attacking Mangog with a wave of his hand. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84</ref> Mangog has yet to return.
