==Ka-Zar (David Rand)==
===Publication history===
The first, David Rand, was a typical "jungle lord" in the [[Tarzan]] vein, also known as Ka-Zar the Great, who first appeared in the pulp magazine ''Ka-Zar'' #1 (1936) from Manvis Publishing, one of many magazine companies owned by [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]].

===Publication history===
The second Ka-Zar started as a similar character, but reminisncent of both Tarzan and writer-artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s popular 1950s [[caveman]] character, [[Tor (comic book)|Tor]].  Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' Vol. 1, #10 (March 1965), he lives in the [[dinosaur]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].

Originally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself (and is called by others) the "Lord of the Savage Land," but the title has no formal weight.

He has had two self-titled series.

===Fictional character biography===
Ka-Zar is Lord Kevin Reginald Plunder, the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the Savage Land.  After his parents were killed, Plunder was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth tiger]] [[Zabu]], who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists.  Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners.

In the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as [[poaching]] and [[mining]], as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.

After the Savage Land became known to outsiders after a visit by the X-Men, many people began travelling to the territory. Among them was Ka-Zar's brother Parnival, who had become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer]]. Ka-Zar has also become romantically involved with female visitors, the first being [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara Morse (who later became the Avenger named [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]) and the adventurer Shanna O'Hara ([[Shanna the She-Devil]]) who married Ka-Zar. They have a son, Matthew.

Ka-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], [[Garokk]], [[Zaladane]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He has met [[Spider-Man]] on several occasions, one of which involved stopping [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many [[Savage Land Races|natives]], they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. The territory was later reconstructed by the [[High Evolutionary]], and Ka-Zar and Shanna resumed their previous roles.  Ka-Zar had a cameo in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', in which he asked [[Jessica Jones]] for her assistance finding Zabu.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the ''Earth X'' series, Ka-Zar (as well as Shanna) have been mutated by Plague X into humanoid saber-toothed tigers. They play an integral part in ''Universe X''- leading Captain America and the reborn Mar-Vell to the gateway to Limbo, and helping the X-Men and Wakandan refugees escape the cannibalistic hordes of Wendigo.

===What If?===
He appears in a What If story, where the Savage Land terraforming has taken over New York. He has a son, Matthew, but it is obvious that Zabu has been killed as his skull is seen on Ka-Zar's head. Both he and Parnival sacrifice themselves to return New York to normal, with Shanna the only survivor of his "family."

===House of M===
Kevin Plunder appears in a short article in The Pulse: House of M Special Edition. The article explains that he has been granted asylum in the US and feature a picture of him alongside his faithful companion Zabu.

===Marvel Zombies===
It is briefly noted in Marvel Zombies that a zombified Quicksilver managed to spread the virus to the Savage Land, infecting Ka-Zar and Zabu.

==In other media==
===Television===
Ka-Zar appears in the 1981 [[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]] cartoon, trying to rescue Zabu from [[Kraven the Hunter]] in "The Hunter and the Hunted".

Ka-Zar appeared on [[X-Men (TV series)|the ''X-Men'' animated series]] in the episodes "[[Reunion (X-Men episode)|Reunion]]" parts 1 and 2, and in "[[Savage Land, Strange Heart]]" parts 1 and 2.

===Video Games===
Ka-Zar appeared in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[John Cygan]].

==Trivia==
{{trivia|date=May 2007}}
* During the early 1980s, Marvel experimented with the then-new comic book specialty outlets by turning three of their monthly comic titles into "direct distribution only" titles. These comics were printed on harder paper stock than the newsprint commonly used for comics at the time, were removed from under the aegis of the [[Comics Code Authority]], and were written and drawn with more mature, adult themes. They were only available via subscription or from a direct distribution comics specialty store. Ka-Zar was one of the three titles to receive this treatment (The other two were [[Moon Knight]] and [[Micronauts (comic book)|The Micronauts]]).

* The Jungle Lord in [[Warren Ellis]]' ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' is named Kevin Sack, a reference to Kevin Plunder.
