'''Ka-Zar''' (pronounced "KAY-sar") is the name of two jungle-dwelling [[fictional character]]s, both published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The first originated in the [[pulp magazine]]s, while the second exists in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The first, David Rand, was a typical "jungle lord" who first appeared in ''Ka-Zar'' #1 ([[Manvis Publishing]], [[1936]]).  He was an unremarkable [[Tarzan]] clone who was adapted by Marvel starting with ''Marvel Comics'' #1.  Although he once met the [[original Human Torch]], Marvel company policy is that this character never existed; the only Ka-Zar is the second one.

The second, Lord Kevin Reginald Plunder, started as a similar character, but a clone of both Tarzan and [[Turok]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' volume 1 #10 ([[1965]]).  He lives in the [[dinosaur]]- and [[caveman]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[alien]]s.  He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the Savage Land.  He was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth tiger]] Zabu, who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists.  Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners.  His brother Parnival is the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer]]; his wife is the adventurer [[Shanna the She-Devil]], and they have a son, Matthew.
