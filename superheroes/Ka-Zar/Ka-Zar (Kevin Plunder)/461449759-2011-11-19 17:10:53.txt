'''Ka-Zar''' is the name of two [[jungle]]-dwelling comics [[fictional character]]s published in the [[United States]]. The first ('''David Rand''') appeared in [[pulp magazine]]s of the 1930s, and was adapted for his second iteration, as a [[comic book]] character for [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s and [[1940s]] predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]. The second and more prominent ('''Kevin Plunder''') is a heroic character in the {{Marvel Universe}}.

==Publication history==
===David Rand===
{{See also|Ka-Zar (pulp series)}}

The first Ka-Zar, David Rand, was a typical "jungle lord" in the [[Tarzan]] vein, also known as Ka-Zar the Great, who first appeared in the pulp magazine ''Ka-Zar'' #1 (Oct. 1936)<ref>[http://old.toonopedia.com/kazar.htm Ka-Zar (David Rand)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]</ref> from Manvis Publishing, one of many magazine companies owned by [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]. Writer-artist Ben Thompson adapted the pulp story "King of Fang and Claw" by Bob Byrd for Goodman's first comic book, ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 (Oct. 1939). In the 2000s, the David Rand Ka-Zar was featured in the ''All New Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe A-Z''.

===Kevin Plunder===
The second Ka-Zar started as a similar character, but reminiscent of both [[Tarzan]] and of writer-artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s 1950s [[caveman]] character, [[Tor (comic book)|Tor]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]''  #10 (March 1965), he lives in the [[dinosaur]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].

Originally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the "Lord of the Savage Land", a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.

He has had four self-titled series (1970–1971; three issues, mostly reprints), 1974-1977 (20 issues) by [[Mike Friedrich]], 1981-1984 (''Ka-Zar the Savage'', 34 issues) by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and [[Mike Carlin]], and 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by [[Mark Waid]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20710 Ka-Zar, 1997], Pipeline, [[Comic Book Resources]], April 7, 2009</ref>

Ka-Zar was one of the three Marvel titles in the early 1980s to be available only via subscription or from a direct distribution comics specialty store (the other two were ''[[Moon Knight]]'' and ''[[Micronauts (comic book)|The Micronauts]]'').{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Fictional character biography==
===David Rand===
[[File:Kazar 1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|David Rand, the original Ka-Zar alongside his lion Zar, from the cover of the pulp magazine ''Ka-Zar v1#1 October 1936''. This character was later integrated into [[Marvel Comics]] (then called [[Timely Comics]]) via ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 (Oct. 1939).]]

Born in South Africa in 1918, three-year-old David Rand accompanied his British parents John and Constance on a flight to Cairo to visit his grandfather. Unfortunately, their plane crashed in the jungles of Congo. Constance died in the crash and John was driven mad. Living in the jungle with his father, isolated from the local tribes, David grew under the jungle’s hardships into an unusually powerful youth and developed strong empathy with wildlife, notably rescuing Zar the [[Lion]] from quicksand. When a criminal named Paul de Kraft discovered emeralds in Congo, John died opposing him only for Zar to scare Paul de Kraft off. With the support of Zar, David became the jungle's leading warrior within a few years challenging different animals like Bardak the [[Ape]] and N'Jaga the [[Leopard]]. Considered to be "god-like" by the natives, David Rand ended up named Ka-Zar (native for "Brother of Zar"). When Paul de Kraft returned to seize the emerald deposits, Ka-Zar killed him thus avenging his father.

With the help of the local animals, Ka-Zar established himself as the guardian of the jungle which involved meeting out harsh retribution to any intruder seeking to exploit his resources-but he frequently aided more benign explorers, such as when he protected Prof. Rice and his daughter Mara from the criminal pilot “Red” Skelton, rescued Rita Grey from the Wabi tribe, and helped two Scotland Yard detectives capture murderer London Jack. When Zar the Lion was captured by the vicious Rajah Sarput and a big game hunter named Bradley, Ka-Zar stowed away on a ship when Zar was shipped to the United States. Though he managed to free Zar, Ka-Zar ended up arrested when he tried to free the zoo animals. Fortunately, Ruth Wilson (another woman whom Ka-Zar had rescued during an African expedition), vouched for him. Ka-Zar and Zar were granted passage back to Africa on a British ship. Surviving attacks by entrenched Nazi forces, Ka-Zar and Zar confronted Sarput who was ultimately slain by their ally Trajah the [[Elephant]]. Soon after, Ka-Zar learned he had inherited his father’s Transvaal diamond mines. After preventing his inheritance’s theft by John Rand’s law partner Alec Wright, donated the wealth to war relief in England.

While on an expedition to the mysterious Black River Region, Ka-Zar encountered giants and subterranean lizard people. Ka-Zar managed to befriend a giant named Bogat. Ka-Zar later waged a series of campaigns against the Axis forces in Ethiopia, Somaililand, and anywhere else in Africa where the Axis forces were camped killing them with their own weapons with help from the French and British forces. Following one such encounter, Ka-Zar was restored to health by an aged witch doctor, who gave him a brew used centuries before to grant his tribe superhuman strength, Ka-Zar’s exploits earned him such fame that he was invited to attend a meeting of superhuman champions in mid-194. Last time anyone heard from Ka-Zar, he protected his region’s wildlife when Africa was threatened by monstrous tidal waves from Atlantean warfare. The rest of Ka-Zar's life after that was left unchronicled.

Ka-Zar is Lord Kevin Reginald Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, [[Kentish Town]], [[London]], [[England]]. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the [[Savage Land]].  After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives of the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth cat]] [[Zabu]], who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists. "Ka-Zar" means "Son of the Tiger" in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land.

In the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as [[poaching]] and [[mining]], as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.

The original [[X-Men]] discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time.<ref>''X-Men'' #10</ref> He then encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #12-14</ref> He then encountered the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] for the first time, and battled Umbu the Unliving.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #109-111</ref> He was once 'tricked' into confronting [[Spider-Man]] after [[J. Jonah Jameson]] convinced him that Spider-Man was a menace when the wall-crawler's memory was erased and he was tricked into working with [[Doctor Octopus]]. Spider-Man's memory was restored during the fight, with Ka-Zar subsequently apologizing for the mistake and proclaiming Spider-Man as the most valiant opponent he had ever fought.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #58-#59</ref> Ka-Zar then battled [[Kraven the Hunter]] for the first time.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #1-2</ref>

After the Savage Land became known to outsiders after the visit by the X-Men, many people began traveling to the territory. Ka-Zar has also become romantically involved with female visitors, the first being [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara Morse (who later became the Avenger named [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]).<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #8</ref> He first battled [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and met the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #12-13</ref> He then met Spider-Man once again, and battled the extraterrestrial [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #103-104</ref> He next met the adventurer [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna O'Hara]],<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #1</ref> and began a romance with her. He has battled [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and visited other dimensions.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #14-20</ref> Later, he first battled [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]].<ref>''X-Men'' #61-63</ref> and then teamed with the X-Men to battle [[Zaladane]] and [[Garokk]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #115-116</ref>

Ka-Zar later discovered that the Savage Land is a part of Pangaea.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #1</ref> He then battles [[Belasco]] for the first time.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #12</ref> He later marries Shanna, who has taken the name Shanna the She-Devil.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #29</ref> His brother Parnival was apparently killed during one of his schemes (though much later turned up alive).<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #33</ref>

Ka-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many [[Savage Land Races|natives]], they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world.<ref>''Avengers'' #256-258</ref> Together, he and Shanna had a son named Matthew. The territory was later reconstructed by the [[High Evolutionary]] using Garokk, and Ka-Zar and Shanna returned with their newborn and resumed their previous roles.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12</ref>

Ka-Zar and Shanna separated for a time,<ref>''Ka-Zar Graphic Novel''</ref> but got back together before long. Ka-Zar fought and defeated [[Thanos]] in one of his many attempts to end life, and later sought the help of investigator [[Jessica Jones]] for assistance locating Zabu.<ref>''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #24 (September 2003)</ref>

Shanna and Ka-Zar find [[Skrull]]s mining the rare metal [[vibranium]] in the Savage Land. Soon afterward, as part of the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until it is hit by a dart that causes it to regress to a Skrull named Pit'o Nilli.<ref>''New Avengers'' #42</ref> He then later goes with the rest of the Avengers to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion while Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

Ka-Zar later meets [[Reptil]] when he and Tigra have rescued Moon-Boy. After reuniting Moon-Boy with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kevin Plunder is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He utilizes a unique style of hand-to-hand combat shaped by years of surviving in the Savage Land.

It was revealed in ''Astonishing Tales'' #11, scripted by Roy Thomas, that Ka-Zar's and Zabu's physical abilities had been enhanced by passing through some mysterious mist.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #11</ref> The mists later endowed other characters (Maa-Gor and El Tigre) with superhuman abilities.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' (1974 series) #3-5</ref>
