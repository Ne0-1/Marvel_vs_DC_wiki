==Publication history==
[[File:Ka-Zar by Jack Kirby.jpg|190px|thumb|right|Cover to ''the X-Men'' #10 the first appearance of Ka-Zar and his [[Smilodon|sabretooth tiger]], [[Zabu]]; art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
The second Ka-Zar started as a character similar to the first [[Ka-Zar (David Rand)|Ka-Zar]], but also reminiscent of both [[Tarzan]] and of writer-artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s 1950s [[caveman]] character, [[Tor (comic book)|Tor]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #10 (March 1965), he lives in the [[dinosaur]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. The character was based on his pulp magazine namesake only to the extent that he used the same name and rough "jungle lord" concept, and Lee has admitted that he had never even read any of the original Ka-Zar stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= #104| pages= 19–20|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Originally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the "Lord of the Savage Land", a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.

Ka-Zar's first solo story was published in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #19 (1969), and the character had features in the black-and-white magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' and the color title ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''. He has had five self-titled series, the first published in 1970–1971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second, which continued the storyline from ''Astonishing Tales'', in 1974-1977 (20 issues, subtitled ''Lord of the Hidden Jungle'') by [[Mike Friedrich]], [[Gerry Conway]], and [[Doug Moench]], the third in 1981-1984, ''Ka-Zar the Savage'', (34 issues) by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and [[Mike Carlin]], the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by [[Mark Waid]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20710 Ka-Zar, 1997], Pipeline, [[Comic Book Resources]], April 7, 2009</ref> and drawn by [[Andy Kubert]], and the fifth in 2011 (5-issue miniseries) written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ka-Zar is Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, [[Kentish Town]], [[London]], [[England]]. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the [[Savage Land]]. After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives of the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth tiger]] [[Zabu]], who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=107}}</ref> "Ka-Zar" means "Son of the Tiger" in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land.

In the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as poaching and [[mining]], as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.

The original [[X-Men]] discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time.<ref>''The X-Men'' #10</ref> He then encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer (character)|Plunderer]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #12-14</ref> He first battled [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]] alongside the X-Men.<ref>''The X-Men'' #61-63.

Marvel Comics.</ref> He was once 'tricked' into confronting [[Spider-Man]] after [[J. Jonah Jameson]] convinced him that Spider-Man was a menace when the wall-crawler's memory was erased and he was tricked into working with [[Doctor Octopus]]. Spider-Man's memory was restored during the fight, with Ka-Zar subsequently apologizing for the mistake and proclaiming Spider-Man as the most valiant opponent he had ever fought.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #57.

After the Savage Land became known to outsiders after the visit by the X-Men, many people began traveling to the territory. Ka-Zar has also become romantically involved with female visitors, the first being [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara Morse (who later became the Avenger named [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]).<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> He first battled [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], and met the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #12-13. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then met Spider-Man once again, and battled the extraterrestrial [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #103-104. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next met the adventurer [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna O'Hara]].<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He battled [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and visited other dimensions.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #14-20.

Marvel Comics.</ref> then teamed with the X-Men to battle Zaladane and a reborn Garokk.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #115-116. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ka-Zar, during a search for the lost Zabu, later discovered Pangaea, an ancient refuge created by the Atlanteans.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #1.

He is flown to New York City, but escapes the plane at Kennedy Airport.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> With no memory and no ability to speak, he wanders New York, saving lives and fighting crime.

Marvel Comics.</ref> During the ceremony, a war (incited by the machinations of Belasco) breaks out in Pangea, which ends when Ka-Zar and Shanna are banished.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #29-30. Marvel Comics.</ref> His brother Parnival arrived in the Savage Land, searching for anti-metal Vibranium, and was apparently killed during his scheme (though much later turned up alive).<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #31-33.

The Nuwali use human adrenalin to poison their rivals, and also reveal to Shanna that she is pregnant.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ka-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel's heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many natives, they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world.<ref>''The Avengers'' #256-258. Marvel Comics.</ref> Together, he and Shanna had a son named Matthew. The territory was later reconstructed by the [[High Evolutionary]] using Garokk, and Ka-Zar and Shanna returned with their newborn and resumed their previous roles.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' Annual #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ka-Zar and Shanna separated for a time,<ref>''Ka-Zar Graphic Novel''. Marvel Comics.</ref> but got back together before long. Ka-Zar fought and defeated [[Thanos]] in one of his many attempts to end life, and later sought the help of investigator [[Jessica Jones]] for assistance locating Zabu.<ref>''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #24 (Sept. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shanna and Ka-Zar find [[Skrull]]s mining the rare metal [[vibranium]] in the Savage Land. Soon afterward as part of the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until he is hit by a dart that causes him to regress to a Skrull named Pitt'o Nili, who is killed by Shanna while still believing himself to be Captain America due to the extensive mind conditioning carried out on him.<ref>''The New Avengers'' #42. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then later goes with the rest of the Avengers to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion while Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ka-Zar later meets [[Reptil]] when he and Tigra have rescued Moon-Boy. After reuniting Moon-Boy with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ka-Zar and Shanna later encounter the return of the Ethereals and end up fighting them when it comes to the Ethereals wanting the tribes of the Savage Land to be united with them.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' (vol. 5) #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He later teams with [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] to protect the Savage Land from outside forces.<ref>''Skaar: King of the Savage Land'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ka-Zar later appears as a member of the Agents of Wakanda.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During "[[The War of the Realms]]" storyline, Ka-Zar picks up [[Gorilla-Man]] from the Wundagore Zoo in [[Transia]], who was discussing with [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] about an undercover operation he is running for [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and takes him to Avengers Mountain. Ka-Zar and Gorilla Man are then seen inside Roxxon's secret base in [[Antarctica]], fighting the company's Berserkers alongside [[Blade (comics)|Blade]].<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #19-20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Ka-Zar is unable to reach Shanna the She-Devil. Black Panther instructs Brother Voodoo to take Ka-Zar, Zabu, Black Knight, and Scarlet Witch with him to investigate. They arrive to find a slain Tyrannosaurus as Scarlet Witch senses they are surrounded. The group is attacked by the Cotati and they fight them until the Cotati Ventri unleash Man-Thing who they have under their control. As Ventri states that the Savage Land and the world will be theirs, Ka-Zar is shocked to find that the Cotati have gained control of Shanna.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to her connection with the Savage Land's lifeforce which the Cotati took advantage of, Shanna tries to get Ka-Zar to join them as Matthew states to Black Knight that they have to do something. Doctor Voodoo used a trick to do a mental trick. Scarlet Witch does the same as she tries to free Shanna from the Cotati's control. To assist her, Scarlet Witch brings Ka-Zar into Shanna's mind where he learns that some creatures in the Savage Land are dying and trees are falling. As Matthew and Black Knight fight the Cotati, a Doctor Voodoo-controlled Man-Thing fights the Cotati's control and defeats Ventri. When Ka-Zar frees Shanna from the Cotati's control, he is stabbed in the back by a Cotati using Black Knight's Ebony Blade.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Now back to her senses, the She-Devil aids the Avengers against the invaders. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Doctor Voodoo work to extract Ka-Zar's soul from the Ebony Blade, to which Shanna then uses the same fluids of the Man-Thing which revived her in order to heal and resurrect Ka-Zar. It works as the Savage Lord helps turn the tide on the Cotati where dinosaurs show up to help.<ref>''Empyre: Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ka-Zar would have trouble adjusting to his newly expanded senses while life in the Savage Land would come under threat by a precursor to its creation known as Domovoy the Flesh Weaver. He would work through this odd connection with the world Kevin calls home now shared between him & his wife in the time needed to save their son from the Polyscion's plans of global terraforming.<ref>''Ka-Zar: Lord of the Savage Land'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

In the meantime, between domestic concerns and globe trotting adventures, Ka-Zar would continue his work as an Agent of Wakanda. Working as a temporal explorer sent back to the distant past of the newly formed Earth on an observation mission regarding it's primordial defenders wellbeing on T'Challa's behalf. After an encounter with the ancient ancestors of Earth's Mightiest, during a battle with Kid Thanos of Titan; a rival time traveler, Ka-Zar's attempted return to his own time is waylaid by the [[Howard Stark#Iron Inquisitor|Iron Inquisitor]] on orders from Mephistopheles.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> Finding himself stranded in an alien timeline on a world soon to be consumed by its still living iteration of Galactus, Ka-Zar poises himself for the fight of his life. He soon becomes The Devourer's new herald in exchange for maneuvering this new handler into getting back to his home reality to warn the Avengers of the threat posed to their universe. Now backed by Power Cosmic, the Savage Herald seeks out viable and uninhabited planets for Galactus to feed upon whilst navigating time and space to make his way home.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

After being healed by the same waters used to resurrect Shanna the She-Devil, Ka-Zar is tied into the life force of the Savage Land.
