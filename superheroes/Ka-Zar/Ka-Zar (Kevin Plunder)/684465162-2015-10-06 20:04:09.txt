'''Ka-Zar''' (pronunciation: KAY-sar<ref>''X-Men'' #10 (March 1965)</ref>) is the name of two [[jungle]]-dwelling fictional comic book characters published in the [[United States]]. The first Ka-Zar was named [[Ka-Zar (magazine)|'''David Rand''']], and debuted in 1936, first appearing in [[pulp magazine]]s of the 1930s. In 1939 he was adapted for his second iteration, a [[comic book]] character for [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s and 1940s predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]. The second and more prominent Ka-Zar was named '''Kevin Plunder''', and first appeared in 1965. He is a heroic character in the {{Marvel Universe}}.

==Publication history==
[[Image:Ka-Zar by Jack Kirby.jpg|190px|thumb|left|Cover to ''the X-Men'' # 10 the first appearance of Ka-Zar and his [[Smilodon|sabretooth tiger]], [[Zabu]].<br>Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
The second Ka-Zar started as a similar character, but reminiscent of both [[Tarzan]] and of writer-artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s 1950s [[caveman]] character, [[Tor (comic book)|Tor]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #10 (March 1965), he lives in the [[dinosaur]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].

Originally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the "Lord of the Savage Land", a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.

He has had four self-titled series, the first published in 1970â€“1971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second in 1974-1977 (20 issues) by [[Mike Friedrich]], the third in 1981-1984 (''Ka-Zar the Savage'', 34 issues) by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and [[Mike Carlin]], and the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by [[Mark Waid]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20710 Ka-Zar, 1997], Pipeline, [[Comic Book Resources]], April 7, 2009</ref> Ka-Zar's first solo story was published in Marvel Super-Heroes #19 (1969), and the character had features in the black-and-white magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' and the color title ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''.

==Fictional character biography==

Ka-Zar is Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, [[Kentish Town]], [[London]], [[England]]. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the [[Savage Land]]. After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives of the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth tiger]] [[Zabu]], who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists. "Ka-Zar" means "Son of the Tiger" in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land.

In the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as [[poaching]] and [[mining]], as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.

The original [[X-Men]] discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time.<ref>''X-Men'' #10</ref> He then encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #12-14</ref> He then encountered the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] for the first time, and battled Umbu the Unliving.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #109-111</ref> He was once 'tricked' into confronting [[Spider-Man]] after [[J. Jonah Jameson]] convinced him that Spider-Man was a menace when the wall-crawler's memory was erased and he was tricked into working with [[Doctor Octopus]]. Spider-Man's memory was restored during the fight, with Ka-Zar subsequently apologizing for the mistake and proclaiming Spider-Man as the most valiant opponent he had ever fought.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #58-#59</ref> Ka-Zar then battled [[Kraven the Hunter]] for the first time.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #1-2</ref>

After the Savage Land became known to outsiders after the visit by the X-Men, many people began traveling to the territory. Ka-Zar has also become romantically involved with female visitors, the first being [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara Morse (who later became the Avenger named [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]).<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #8</ref> He first battled [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and met the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #12-13</ref> He then met Spider-Man once again, and battled the extraterrestrial [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #103-104</ref> He next met the adventurer [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna O'Hara]],<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #1</ref> and began a romance with her. He has battled [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and visited other dimensions.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' #14-20</ref> Later, he first battled [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]].<ref>''X-Men'' #61-63</ref> and then teamed with the X-Men to battle [[Zaladane]] and [[Garokk]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #115-116</ref>

Ka-Zar later discovered that the Savage Land is a part of Pangaea.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #1</ref> He then battles [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] for the first time.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #12</ref> He later marries Shanna, who has taken the name Shanna the She-Devil.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #29</ref> His brother Parnival was apparently killed during one of his schemes (though much later turned up alive).<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #33</ref>

Ka-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel's heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many [[Savage Land Races|natives]], they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world.<ref>''Avengers'' #256-258</ref> Together, he and Shanna had a son named Matthew. The territory was later reconstructed by the [[High Evolutionary]] using Garokk, and Ka-Zar and Shanna returned with their newborn and resumed their previous roles.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12</ref>

Ka-Zar and Shanna separated for a time,<ref>''Ka-Zar Graphic Novel''</ref> but got back together before long. Ka-Zar fought and defeated [[Thanos]] in one of his many attempts to end life, and later sought the help of investigator [[Jessica Jones]] for assistance locating Zabu.<ref>''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #24 (September 2003)</ref>

Shanna and Ka-Zar find [[Skrull]]s mining the rare metal [[vibranium]] in the Savage Land. Soon afterward as part of the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until it is hit by a dart that causes it to regress to a Skrull named Pit'o Nilli.<ref>''New Avengers'' #42</ref> He then later goes with the rest of the Avengers to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion while Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

Ka-Zar later meets [[Reptil]] when he and Tigra have rescued Moon-Boy. After reuniting Moon-Boy with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil''</ref>

Ka-Zar and Shanna later encounter the return of the Ethereals and end up fighting them when it comes to the Ethereals wanting the tribes of the Savage Land to be united with them.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 5 #1-5</ref>
