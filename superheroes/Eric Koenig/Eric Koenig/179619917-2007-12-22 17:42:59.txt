'''Eric Koenig''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos vol. 1 #9''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Eric Koenig''' was a member of the original [[Howling Commandos]] and fought alongside the team during [[World War II]].  He was a pilot as well as a trainer and was very Anti-Nazi German as the Nazis killed his sister.  He was the replacement of [[Dino Manelli]], who was away on a special mission, and then replaced [[Izzy Cohen]] when he was a Prisoner of War.  Upon Cohenâ€™s return, Koenig stayed as a member of the team.  After the war, Koenig was one of the Howlers that joined Nick Fury in forming [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]
In Nick Fury vs. SHIELD #1-3, a [[Life Model Decoy]] of Koenig appeared and was part of the Deltite affair.  It destroyed itself in issue 3, after being captured and scanned by [[Tony Stark]].
