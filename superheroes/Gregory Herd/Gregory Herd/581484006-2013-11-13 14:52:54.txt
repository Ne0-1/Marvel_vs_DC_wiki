Desperate for some way to save his wife, Herd asks to join Osborn's "Gathering of Five" ceremony in order to gain one of five "gifts".<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #32</ref> However, Herd is the recipient of death, which gives Herd new powers while steadily destroying him over time. He falls under the thumb of a man named Dolman, who owned one of the five artifacts used in the Gathering ceremony before it was stolen by Osborn. Dolman intends to use Herd as a tool to regain what Osborn had stolen. Herd assaults Osborn Industries but runs into the current [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #2 (Feb. 1999)</ref> Herd dismisses Franklin with little effort but is later forced to battle the original Spider-Man and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] while trying to tell officials that Dolman was tampering with his mind. He convinces Iceman to freeze him entirely in an attempt to stay alive.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #3 (Mar. 1999)</ref>

Though temporarily frozen, Shadrac is still dying albeit in a less painful manner. Later pursuing Dolman, Shadrac, Iceman, and Spider-Man team up to capture him. After Dolman merges with the Spindle and gains powers, Shadrac "overrides" him and possesses his body in a last-ditch effort to stop Dolman and save himself.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #3 (April 1999)</ref>

===Civil War===
Somehow separated from both Shadrac and Dolman, with Aura restored to human form, and back in his original costume, Herd joins [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s "villain army" that was captured by [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' (Feb. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===As Override===
Dr. Gregory Herd wore a cybernetically enhanced costume that allowed him to control, or "override", any other electronic device (including but by no means limited to Spider-Man's web-shooters).

===As Shadrac===
Herd's entire body was constantly consumed in intense flames which he could manipulate in the form of blasts emitted from his hands or an aura he could expand at will. It is unknown what high temperatures he could reach, but Shadrac was able to melt metal at the touch of his hands. Originally, he had a mechanical apparatus in his costume that allowed him to override and control electrical and mechanical devices. Due to the Gathering Of The Five ceremony, this has been absorbed into his physiology and can now override emotions as well, but his main power is the mystical flames which are killing him.
