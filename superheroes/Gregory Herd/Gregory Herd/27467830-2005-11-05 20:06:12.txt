'''Shadrac''' (Dr. Gregory Herd) is a supervillain created in the [[Marvel Comics]] main [[Earth-616]] continuity who originally appeared as Shadrac in Amazing Spider-Man #2 Vol. 2.  He was formally known as '''Override'''.

==Origin==

As Override, Dr. Herd joined [[Norman Osborn]]'s "Gathering of Five" ceremony in order to gain one of five "gifts": power, madness, knowledge, immortality, and death.  He'd only joined as a means to find a way to help his injured wife.  However, Herd was the unfortunate recipient of death.  In a turn of events, death gave Herd new powers while steadily destroying him over time.  He fell under the thumb of a man named Dolman, who originally owned one of the five artifacts used in the Gathering ceremony; an artifact that was stolen by Osborn.  Dolman intended to use Herd as a tool to regain what Osborn had stolen.  Herd assaulted Osborn Industries but incidentally ran into [[Spider-Man]] (who at the time was portrayed by [[Mattie Franklin]]--ironically, another member of the Gathering ceremony).

Herd dismissed Franklin with little effort but was later forced to battle the original Spider-Man and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] while trying to tell officials the truth of Dolman tampering with his mind.  He managed to convince Iceman to freeze him entirely in an attempt to stay alive.

==Powers and abilities==

As Shadrac, Herd's entire body was constantly consumed in intense flames which he could manipulate in the form of blasts emitted from his hands or an aura he could expand at will.  It is unknown what high temperatures he could reach, but Shadrac was able to melt metal at the touch of his hands.
