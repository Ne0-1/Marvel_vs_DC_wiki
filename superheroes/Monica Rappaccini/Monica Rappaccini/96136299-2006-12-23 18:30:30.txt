'''Monica Rappaccini''' is a fictional villain in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]].

==History==
While enrolled as a biochemistry student at the [[University of Padua]], Monica Rappaccini went to [[New Mexico]]'s Desert State University to study and shared a brief relationship with Bruce Banner, a physics student who would later become the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  The ruthless Monica used their relationship to exploit Banner's radiation expertise for her own research.  Upon attaining her doctorate, Monica quickly became a world-renowned innovator of anti-toxins and antidotes for various enviromental poisons and nearly won the [[Nobel Prize]].

Recognizing the many environmental and political failings of Western Civilization, Monica decided it was too corrupt to exist.  She joined a series of terrorist organizations - first the pan-European leftist group [[Black Orchestra]], then [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (A.I.M.), where she had a brief relationship with fellow agent George Tarleton (later [[MODOK]]).  Now making poisons instead of curing them, Monica's expertise with toxins allowed her to rise quickly through A.I.M.'s ranks.  She implanted her own daughter and several other newborn children of A.I.M. members with memetic antibodies and released them into the world as A.I.M. waker agents with no knowledge of their heritage, programmed to travel instinctively to the nearest A.I.M. biohaven when their antibodies activated at age 16.  Monica's daughter was raised in [[Vermont]] as [[Carmilla Black]] by undercover A.I.M. agents.  Monica went underground for nearly two decades, studying potential power sources as the sentient [[Uni-Power]] and orchestrating attacks on capitalism, such as the dioxin-based gas attack on [[Hong Kong]].

When the A.I.M. Scientist Supreme was slain by his own renegade creation, MODOK, Monica became head of the splinter faction of A.I.M. that remained independent from MODOK's control.  Upon MODOK's defeat by [[Iron Man]] and [[Captain America]], Monica's splinter group absorbed his A.I.M. cell and reunited the organization.  The A.I.M. Ruling Council unanimously elected Monica Scientist Supreme shortly after.  As A.I.M. leader, Monica rarely did field work, preferring to act through agents and proxies.  When she recently led an A.I.M. attack on the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, it was thwarted by her estranged 19-year old daughter, who had since joined forces with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and became the costumed Scorpion.  Rappaccini eluded capture and soon attempted to harness the malfunctioning Uni-Power, but her plans were thwarted by Scorpion and several heroes who bonded with the Uni-Power.

When the mutant [[Scarlet Witch]] reality-warped [[Earth]] into a mutant-dominated society, Monica worked alongside Scorpion and the Hulk to overthrow Governor Exodus' fascist mutant government in [[Australia]].  When the Hulk became Australia's new leader, Monica's secret plan to create a cybernetic army to overthrow Earth's mutant rulers was exposed.  Denying any knowledge of the army, Monica promised to restore the cyborgs' humanity.  When this warped reality was undone, a disoriented Monica found herself stranded in Australia alongside Bruce Banner.  Evading Scorpion's attempt to arrest her, Monica returned to A.I.M.

=='''NOTE'''==
In the alternate future timeline of Earth-6216, Monica's granddaughter Varina Goddard attempted to assassinate the [[United  Nations Secretary General]] with an alien Death's Head robot housing synthetic Uni-Power.
