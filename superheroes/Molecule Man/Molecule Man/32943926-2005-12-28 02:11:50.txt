'''Molecule Man''' (Owen Reece) is an [[elemental]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, and an enemy of [[Klaw]]. His first appearance was in Fantastic Four (Vol.1) #20.
==Character biography==
As a child, Owen Reece was weak and timid, and he grew up extremely weak-willed. He found a job at an [[Acme Atomics Corporation]] laboratory as a lowly lab assistant/technician for professional scientists. One day he accidentally started up a particle generator, and huge amounts of radiation bombarded Reece. He was empowered with the ability to control all matter and energy. The forces released from the accident opened up a small portal between our dimension and a world known as the [[Beyond-Realm]]. This was the beginning of the encounters that our world had with the [[Beyonder]].

Frustrated with the life he was forced to eke out and seduced by his new powers, Reece decided to turn to villainy. Reece constructed for himself a costume, called himself Molecule Man, and became a dangerous criminal. He was once nearly killed by Wolverine during Secret Wars. [[Volcana]] was once his girlfriend.

==Powers and abilities==
Vast psionic ability to manipulate all matter and energy on a subatomic level. He can use his power to reconfigure all forms of matter into different substances and forms and can change matter to energy and back again. Although he's not very good with complicated items like electronics or plumbing.  He can also open up worm holes through hyperspace and traverse them, thus travelling faster than light. 

He once believed that he could only effect inorganic materials and was proven wrong. He also once believed that he needed a special wand, but it turned out that the wand was an ordinary piece of metal and that the vast powers originated from his own being and not the wand.
