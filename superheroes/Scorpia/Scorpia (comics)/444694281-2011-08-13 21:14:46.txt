'''Scorpia''' (real name '''Elaine Colls''') is a [[fictional]] [[super villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  A psychotic female version of the [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]], Scorpia is a long-time enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  She was recruited by [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]] from a [[mental hospital]] and given robotic armor which enhanced her strength and speed five hundred percent.

==Fictional character biography==
Elaine Colls was a mental patient at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]]. She was chosen by [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]] to become the new [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]] after the retirement of the original. However, she opted to call herself Scorpia, and was eager to get in on some action. Silvermane originally intended for Scorpia to aid the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and [[Hydro-Man]] to deliver [[Deathlok]] to him. After interference from [[Spider-Man]], though Scorpia proved herself to be a formidable enemy, she was ultimately taken out. She recovered, and brought the surrendering Deathlok back to Silvermane. She was then ordered to ambush Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who had infiltrated their base. She was able to wear them down, but was then betrayed by Silvermane, who shot her in the back. Infuriated, Scorpia vowed revenge, and followed Spider-Man and Daredevil to his location.  Once there, she immediately attacked, ending her dispute with the heroes and instead going right for her former employer. Mainframe, another of Silvermane's mercenaries, took control over Scorpia's cybernetic enhancements and used her to attack Spider-Man. However, she soon regained mobility and blasted Silvermane. An explosion created by [[Punisher|The Punisher]] knocked Scorpia off the building they were on, but a mentally conflicted Deathlok saved her. She then decided to flee the area, rather than be put in prison.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Scorpia then joined the new [[Sinister Six]] (though there were seven members total) alongside [[Hobgoblin (comics)|The Hobgoblin]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mysterio]], [[Vulture (comics)|The Vulture]], [[Shocker (comics)|The Shocker]], and The Beetle. Their main purpose was to stop [[Kaine]] from killing anymore of Spider-Man's enemies. After Hobgoblin was attacked by Kaine in Spider-Man's disguise, Scorpia immediately joined the others in the battle. However, they were not accustomed to working together, much to Scorpia's disdain. Spider-Man eventually entered the battle and was able to defeat Scorpia herself. She also participated in another battle against Spider-Man with some of her former allies, and new ones such as [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O' Lantern]]. She was defeated when Spider-Man threw Jack O'Lantern at her.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

When Mac Gargan resurfaced, Scorpia laid low for a while.<ref>''Marvel Encyclopedia'' 4: Spider-Man</ref>

Much later, Scorpia was seen attacking [[Carnegie Hall]] in search of a man named Garrison Klum, who she had planned to assassinate in a redesigned suit. She was able to fight her way through various [[policemen]] and [[thugs]], but was attacked by Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. Scorpia held her own against the pair, but Black Cat was able to rip her tail off by jumping out of a hole in the wall while connected to it.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil Men Do'' #2</ref> She was later interrogated (quite humorously) by Spider-Man, where she revealed she was hired by Alberto Ortega, the head of a local drug syndicate.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil Men Do'' #3</ref>

Scorpia recently appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of several villains (consisting of [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Doctor Nemesis]], the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-de-Lance]], [[Hydro-Man]], [[Poundcakes]], [[Powderkeg]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]], [[Rock Python]], [[Squid (comics)|Squid]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], and [[Trapster]]) in the [[Bar With No Name]] watching a fight between Spider-Man and the "Basher" on [[YouTube]]. She was among those that placed their bet with the Bookie.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #562</ref> When the real Spider-Man arrived after the Spider-Man that fought Basher was actually [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] in disguise, Scorpia was among the villains that fought Spider-Man until the bartender Deke broke up the battle telling them that the Bar With No Name is a sanctuary for those on the run from the law.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #563</ref>
