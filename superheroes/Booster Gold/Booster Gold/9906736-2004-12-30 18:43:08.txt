'''Booster Gold''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  Created by [[Dan Jurgens]], he has been a member of the [[Justice League]] and first appeared in ''Booster Gold'' #1.

Michael Jon Carter was a [[American football|football]] star in the [[25th century]], who was fired when he was caught betting on his own games.  He took a job as a night watchman at the Metropolis Space Museum, where he began studying displays about past superheroes and villains, particularly those of the 25th century.  With the help of a security robot named Skeets, he stole various devices from the museum displays, including a [[Legion of Super Heroes]] flight ring and [[Brainiac 5|Brainiac 5's]] force-field belt.  He then used [[Rip Hunter|Rip Hunter's]] time machine (also on display in the museum) to travel back to the [[20th century]], intent on becoming a superhero and on starting a [[corporation]] based around himself to make a comfortable living.  As such, he was a shameless self promoter whose obsession with fame and wealth irritated other heroes.

He was originally based in [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]], the home city of [[Superman]]. Booster Gold was a key charachter in the early 90s revamp of the Justice League with writer J.M. Dematteis and penciller Kevin Maguire. Booster Gold is frequently partnered with fellow former Justice League alumnus [[Blue Beetle]]; the pair were most recently seen in ''Formerly Known as the Justice League''. The duo of Booster and Beetle was responsible for some of the most memorable moments in the Justice League series, including a stint as superhero repo men and the ridiculous construction of a gaming resort, Club JLI, on the living island Kooeykooeykooey. 

Booster Gold also appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.  In that series, Booster is a bit of a pathetic figure who is dismissed by the superhero community who dislike his showboating.  As such, he is treated as a grunt assigned to relatively menial duties.  Eventually, he has an important, if unappreciated, adventure on his own in which he realizes his limitations, but manages to prevail and gain some measure of honest self respect.  He is voiced by [[Tom Everett Scott]].
