'''Booster Gold''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  Created by [[Dan Jurgens]], he has been a member of the [[Justice League]] and first appeared in ''Booster Gold'' #1 ([[1986]]).

==Background / History==
===From the future===
'''Michael Jon Carter''' is a college [[American football|football]] star in the [[25th century]], who is banned from the sport when he is caught betting on his own football games.  He takes a job as a night watchman at the Metropolis [[Space Museum (comics)|Space Museum]], where he begins to study displays about superheroes and villains from the past, particularly the [[20th century]]. With the help of a security robot named [[Skeets]], he steals devices from the museum displays, including a [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] flight ring and [[Brainiac 5]]'s force-field belt.  He uses [[Rip Hunter]]'s time machine, also on display in the museum, to travel to the 20th century, intent on becoming a superhero and a [[corporation]] based around himself to make a comfortable living.  As such, he is a shameless self-promoter whose obsession with fame and wealth irritates other heroes.

Carter's nickname as a football player was Booster, but his chosen 20th century superhero name was [[Goldstar]].  After saving the president, Carter mangles the two names, causing the president (who resembles [[Ronald Reagan]]) to introduce him as "Booster Gold." The name stuck.

===Celebrity===
Booster Gold is originally based in [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]], the home city of [[Superman]].  He starts his hero career by preventing the [[shape-shifting]] assassin [[Chiller (comics)|Chiller]], an operative of [[The 100 (comics)|The 1000]], from killing the [[president of the United States]] and replacing him.  With the public exposure he gains from this rescue, Booster is quickly able to sign a multitude of commercial and movie deals. During Booster's superhero career, his sister Michelle Carter, powered by a magnetic suit, follows in his footsteps as the superheroine [[Goldstar (DC Comics)#Goldstar (Michelle Carter)|Goldstar]]. She dies soon after, leaving him devastated. Amassing a small fortune, Booster founds Goldstar, Inc. (later Booster Gold International) as a holding company and hires Dirk Davis to act as his agent.  During the [[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]] event, Davis reveals that he is a [[Manhunters|Manhunter]] in disguise and has siphoned money from Booster's accounts for months in hopes of leaving Booster no choice but to do the Manhunters' bidding.  Although the Manhunters are ultimately defeated, Booster is left bankrupt.

===''Justice League''===
Booster Gold is a key character in the late '80s/early '90s ''[[Justice League]]'' revamp by writers [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]].  Booster Gold is frequently partnered with fellow Justice League member [[Ted Kord|Blue Beetle]], and the two quickly become best friends.  The duo of Booster and Beetle is responsible for some of the most memorable moments in the ''Justice League'' series, including a stint as superhero repo men and the construction of a gaming resort, Club JLI, on the living island [[Kooey Kooey Kooey]].  

After one too many disgraces and longing for the reputation he once had, Booster quit the League to found [[The Conglomerate (comics)|The Conglomerate]], a superhero team whose funding was derived from corporate sponsors.  Booster and his team were determined to perform as legitimate heroes but found that their sponsors compromised those values far too often.  The Conglomerate re-formed several times after Booster rejoined the League, though never finding much success.

When an alien of awesome power comes to Earth and rampages, it is Booster Gold who coins the name [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] for it.  In the ensuing battle with Doomsday, Booster's costume is destroyed.  Blue Beetle is able to design a new (albeit bulkier) costume to replace it, although this costume often malfunctions.  During a later battle with [[Devastator (DC Comics)|Devastator]] a servant of the [[Overmaster]], Booster is nearly killed and loses an arm.  Again, Blue Beetle comes to his aid, designing a suit that acts as a [[life support]] system in addition to replicating the powers of Booster's previous costumes. This suit also includes a [[cybernetic]] arm to replace the arm Booster had lost.

===''Extreme Justice''===
After the Justice League falls apart, Booster Gold joins [[Extreme Justice]], a team led by [[Captain Atom]]. While a member of this team, Booster makes a deal with the super-villain [[Hank Hall|Monarch]], who fully heals Booster's wounds so that he can once again remove his battle suit.  Booster dons a new costume created in part by Skeets, who aids Booster and is even able to take control of the costume if Booster is rendered unconscious.

Following the disbanding of Extreme Justice, this suit was destroyed. A new costume was created by [[Professor Hamilton]], based on the designs of both the original 25th century costume and the energy containment suit [[Superman]] was wearing at this time. This costume was apparently later "tweaked" to more closely resemble Booster's original costume.

===''Infinite Crisis''===
====''Countdown to Infinite Crisis''====
After the events depicted in the [[limited series]] ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', in which [[Sue Dibny]] is murdered, Booster Gold hangs up his costume and retires from crime-fighting only to once again assume the role to help Blue Beetle discover who is manipulating Kord Industries in ''[[Infinite Crisis#Countdown to Infinite Crisis|Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005).  In the one-shot, Booster is heavily injured in an explosion at Kord's home, and it is revealed that his companion [[Skeets]] has been dismantled for its 25th-century technology by the [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization.

====''The OMAC Project''====
[[Image:Boosterquits.jpg|thumb|Booster Gold farewell to [[Fire (comics)|Fire]].]]
In ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' limited series, Booster Gold gathers the old [[JLA|Justice League International]] heroes to investigate Blue Beetle's disappearance and ultimately find his killer.  At the series' end, he is ruined physically and emotionally, having destroyed much of his gear in the fight against the [[OMACs]], seen more friends fall in the battle, and lost his trust toward the other heroes of the DC universe.  In a moment of self-reflection, he realizes that if only he had bothered to recall more of what was history in his native era, he might have been able to warn his friends.  Giving a tender farewell kiss to the forehead of his wounded teammate [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] as she lay in a hospital bed, he drops his trademark goggles on the floor and leaves, saying only that he had to "go home", the implication being a return to the 25th century.

====The new Blue Beetle====
In the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Booster Gold resurfaces in the ruins of the [[Justice League of America|Justice League]]'s Watchtower on the moon, along with Skeets, again branded as a criminal in his time for "hijacking historical records". When Skeets fails to locate the absent [[Martian Manhunter]], Booster searches for [[Jaime Reyes (comics)|Jaime Reyes]], the new Blue Beetle, whom he promptly takes to the Batcave. Booster tells [[Batman]] the subject of the stolen records: the battle Batman is going to wage against Brother Eye would be a failure, but Booster implies that, with Jaime's aid, they can succeed. The mission is successful, and Booster plays a pivotal role in the destruction of the satellite.

In the aftermath of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Booster Gold attends a memorial for [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] in Metropolis.  Booster has become far more of a corporate shill than he ever was before, selling logo space on his costume, staging fake battles for publicity and using historical knowledge of future events for his own benefit. When Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman do not arrive as Booster expects, the change in history makes Skeets malfunction. [[Skeets]], normally flawless, later reports other incorrect historical data. Booster and Skeets search time traveler [[Rip Hunter]]'s desert bunker for answers but find it littered with scrawled notes. Booster finds photos of himself and Skeets surrounded by the words "his fault" with arrows pointing at both of them.

[[Fire (comics)|Fire]] asks Booster to join in the search for superheroes still missing after the Crisis. Booster says he would but that his schedule prohibits it. Fire is appalled, having thought that Blue Beetle’s death had changed Booster and his priorities, but Booster angrily dismisses Bea’s criticism, saying that risking his life to save the world entitles him to put himself first. [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] tries to get Booster Gold to help him investigate a resurrection cult, but when he realizes that Booster might have been able to save his dead wife Sue Dibny, Ralph attacks him. An actor that Booster had hired for a staged battle finds that his check has bounced, so he reveals the truth about Booster to the press. Dibny calls Booster a fraud in front a group of reporters. Disgraced, Booster also finds that his sponsor have discontinued their association with him, and is then forced to move from his upmarket accommodation to rental apartment which he describes with an obscenity.

When a mysterious superhero named [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]] appears in Metropolis, an angered Booster considers the new hero to be an unwanted replacement. Booster strives to regain the spotlight by containing a nuclear explosion. Supernova attempts to save Booster after the explosion, only to return with Booster's charred corpse. Booster's funeral is held in an isolated church in a city he had never been to. The only attendees are several metahumans paid for their appearances. Skeets recognizes a man named Daniel Carter as Booster's ancestor and uses him to regain access to Rip Hunter's lab. When Skeets sees the arrows Rip Hunter drew on photos...which were actually pointing to Skeets, not Booster...he traps Carter in a time loop and seals the doors for a million years.  [[Skeets]] is thus revealed as one of the antagonists.

After ''52'' Week 15 was released, [[Dan DiDio]] was interviewed about Booster's fate. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=80918] Didio confirmed, "This is the end of the character," though also saying, "The repercussions of the death will play through the remainder of 52, and although this is the conclusion of character, it’s not the conclusion of his story."

==Powers==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2006}}
Booster Gold gains his powers from the artifacts he steals from the museum in the future. A power suit grants him super strength, and wrist blasters allow him to project force blasts. The wrist blasters contain the primary controls and power supply for the suit as well as communications equipment to monitor communications [[frequencies]]. Circuitry from a force field belt that is incorporated into his costume allows Booster to resist physical and energy attacks, and he uses the force field to repel objects with great force and generate a breathable self-contained environment. The force field centers around Boosters body but can expand and even project outward. The costume's goggles had [[infrared]] and [[magnification|magnifying]] capabilities as well. In addition to the powers from his suit, Booster could fly thanks to a Legion flight ring.  In ''Booster Gold'' #8 Booster demonstrates the ability to absorb mass and eject it either in its original form or as a melted mass.

Booster's later costumes use many different technologies to grant him his powers, but the powers themselves remain basically the same despite changes to the source. Booster's third costume acts as a mobile life support system in addition to its granting him super powers.

==Enemies==
Some of his known enemies include:

* [[The 100 (DC Comics)|The 1000]]
* [[Director (comics)|The Director]]
* [[Mindancer]]
* [[Blackguard (comics)|Blackguard]]
* [[Shockwave (DC Comics)|Shockwave]]
* [[Rainbow Raider]]
* [[Mr. Twister]] II
* The [[Manhunters]]
* [[Devastator (DC Comics)|Devastator]]

==In other media==
[[Image:Booster and skeets.JPG|right|thumb|Booster Gold and his personal assistant droid, Skeets, as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]

Booster Gold appears as a member of the Justice League in the [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the episode ''The Greatest Story Never Told'', Booster is voiced by [[Tom Everett Scott]], and Skeets is performed by [[Billy West]]. Booster's colleagues in the Justice League dismiss the shameless, showboating and self-promoting superhero as a hopeless wannabe. Children ask for his autograph, thinking he is a [[Green Lantern]]. During an epic battle with [[Mordru]], Booster is assigned to [[crowd control]], but when another danger presents itself, Booster's calls for help are assumed to be complaints about his assignment. Booster, with the aid of Skeets and Dr. Tracy Simmons, must save the day. Booster halts a scientist's unwitting rampage and saves Skeets and the girl. When Booster returns to his post, [[Batman]] scolds Booster for not following orders and for leaving his post. Finally, Tracy shows her appreciation for Booster's work by going on a date with him.

In the first episode of 2006's ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Superheroes]]'' cartoon, Booster Gold and Skeets make a cameo appearance as the janitors in the Superman museum.

==Trivia==

*The [[Super Buddies]] TV [[promotional]] featured in ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'', in a nod to the Golden Age controversy on [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] being a gay couple, featured Booster Gold and his best pal [[Blue Beetle]] as ''A heterosexual dynamic duo for the new millennium''.  The ensuing embarrassment led to the idea being dismissed.
*During the same series, Booster Gold claimed to have married a much older wealthy woman, Gladys, hoping to become her heir.  His embarrassing matrimonial life (it was hinted that Gladys forced him to dress as [[Wonder Woman]] during their sexual performance) was erased due to the aftermath of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' [http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=526125204c6061d4191567685f6dff3a&threadid=65741], albeit resurrected as a rumor in his ''obituary'' page [http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/WAcker/Booster/BoosterObit.html]
