'''Booster Gold''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Dan Jurgens]], he first appeared in ''Booster Gold'' #1 (February 1986) and has been a member of the [[Justice League]], DC Comics' all-star team of heroes. The character is initially depicted as a glory-seeking showboat from the future, using knowledge of historical events and futuristic technology to stage high-publicity heroics. Booster develops over the course of his publication history and through personal tragedies to become a true hero weighed down by the reputation he has created for himself.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last=Greenberger|first=Robert|contribution=Booster Gold|editor-last=Dougall|editor-first=Alastair|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page=58|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=London|year=2008|isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Booster Gold first appeared in ''Booster Gold'' #1 (February 1986), being the first significant new character introduced into [[DC Universe]] continuity after the reboot of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. The next year, he began to appear regularly in the ''Justice League'' series of comics, remaining a team member until the group was disbanded in 1996 to make way for the new line-up introduced in the ''Justice League: A Midsummer's Nightmare'' miniseries (and featured in the ongoing series ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]''). He and his former Leaguers subsequently appeared as the "Superbuddies" in the ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' miniseries and its ''JLA: Classified'' sequel "I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League".

On March 16, 2007, at [[Wizard World]] Los Angeles, [[Dan DiDio]] announced a new ongoing series titled ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|All-New Booster Gold]]'', which was later published as simply ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Booster Gold]]''. The series follows the events of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' and was initially co-written by [[Geoff Johns]] and Jeff Katz, with art by creator Jurgens and [[Norm Rapmund]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=DC Nation Panel from WW:LA|work=[[Newsarama]]|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423|first=Albert|last=Ching|date=March 16, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Geoff Johns Shares Booster Gold Thoughts|work=Newsarama|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105430|date=March 16, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> The series focuses primarily on Booster Gold's clandestine [[time travel]] within the [[DC Universe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classic.newsarama.com/dcnew/Booster/booster.html|title=Johns, Katz, and Jurgens Talk Booster Gold|work=Newsarama|date=March 21, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-22}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The series also features [[Rip Hunter]], [[Skeets]], and Booster's ancestors Daniel Carter and Rose Levin as supporting characters. The tagline of the series is: "The greatest hero you've never heard of!"<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 52 Exit Interviews: Geoff Johns|work=Newsarama | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111254|first=Vaneta|last=Rogers|date=May 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> Katz and Johns later announced that they would be leaving the book after 12 issues (#1-10, [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|#0]], and a [[DC One Million|One Million]] issue). Jurgens and Rapmund stated that they would stay on the series, which would be written by Jurgens following four issues by guest writers [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[Rick Remender]].

In May 2010, [[Keith Giffen]] took over the ''Booster Gold'' title, linking it with the 26 week miniseries ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', which saw Booster unite with his JLI teammates [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], and [[Captain Atom]] to take down the resurrected [[Maxwell Lord]]. From July 2010 through February 2011, Booster also starred alongside Rip, [[Green Lantern]], and [[Superman]] in the six-issue miniseries ''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'', part of the "[[The Return of Bruce Wayne|Return of Bruce Wayne]]" arc, which also reintroduced the [[Reverse-Flash]] and established background for the 2011 DC crossover event ''[[Flash: Flashpoint|Flashpoint]]''.<ref name="tmvpflashpoint">{{Cite web | first=Russ|last=Burlingame|work=Comic Related|title=Time Masters: ''Vanishing Point'' #6 and ''Flashpoint'' Exclusive News!|url=http://comicrelated.com/news/10599/flashpoint-exclusive|date=February 3, 2011}}</ref> It was announced that Dan Jurgens would return to the main ''Booster Gold'' title with issue #44.<ref name="tmvpflashpoint"/>

==Fictional character biography==
===From the future===
Michael Jon Carter was born poor in the [[Gotham City]] of the 25th century.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.boosterrific.com/booster/history.html | title=Boosterrific! History of Booster Gold | work=Boosterrific.com | date=August 21, 1985 | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> He speaks [[Esperanto]] as his first language. He and his twin sister Michelle never knew their father because he left after gambling away all their money. Luckily for Michael, he was a gifted athlete and he managed to get into Gotham University on a football scholarship. In college, Booster became a star [[quarterback]] and had a bright future. His father then reentered his life and convinced him to bet on games and then throw them. After being exposed, his bright future was shattered. He took a job as a night watchman at the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] [[Space Museum (comics)|Space Museum]], where he began to study displays about superheroes and villains from the past, particularly the 20th century. With the help of a security robot named [[Skeets]], Michael stole devices from the museum displays, including a [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] flight ring and [[Brainiac 5]]'s force field belt. He used [[Rip Hunter]]'s time machine, also on display in the museum, to travel to the 20th century, intent on becoming a superhero and forming a [[corporation]] based around himself to make a comfortable living.<ref name="dc-ency"/> As such, he is a shameless self-promoter whose obsession with fame and wealth irritates other heroes.<ref name="bg1">''Booster Gold'' #1 (February 1986)</ref>

Carter's nickname as a football player was "Booster", but his chosen 20th century superhero name was "Goldstar". After saving the president, Carter mangled the two names, causing the president (at the time [[Ronald Reagan]]) to introduce him as "Booster Gold". The name stuck. There is a running joke with his name throughout the DC Universe where people call him "Buster" instead of "Booster".

===Celebrity===
Booster Gold is originally based in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the home city of [[Superman]]. He starts his hero career by preventing the [[shapeshifting]] assassin Chiller, an operative of [[100 (DC Comics)|The 1000]], from killing the [[President of the United States]] and replacing him. With the public exposure he gains from this rescue, Booster is quickly able to sign a multitude of commercial and movie deals. During Booster's superhero career, his sister Michelle Carter, powered by a magnetic suit, follows in his footsteps as the superheroine [[Michelle Carter (comics)|Goldstar]]. She dies soon after while battling creatures from another dimension, leaving him devastated. Amassing a small fortune, Booster founds Goldstar, Inc. (later Booster Gold International) as a holding company and hires Dirk Davis to act as his agent. During the ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' event, Davis reveals that he is a [[Manhunters|Manhunter]] in disguise and has siphoned money from Booster's accounts for months in hopes of leaving Booster no choice but to do the Manhunters' bidding. Although the Manhunters are ultimately defeated, Booster is left bankrupt.

===''Justice League''===
Booster Gold is a key character in the late 1980s/early 1990s ''[[Justice League]]'' revamp by writers [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]]. Booster Gold is frequently partnered with fellow Justice League member [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]], and the two quickly become best friends. Among the duo's more notable appearances include a stint as superhero repo men and the construction of a gaming resort, Club JLI, on the living island [[Kooey Kooey Kooey]].

After one too many disgraces and longing for the reputation he once had, Booster quits the League to found the [[The Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]], a superhero team whose funding is derived from corporate sponsors. Booster and his team are determined to perform as legitimate heroes, but find that their sponsors compromise those values far too often.<ref name="dc-ency"/> The Conglomerate reforms several times after Booster rejoins the League, though without much success.

When an alien comes to Earth on a rampage, it is Booster Gold who coins the name [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] for it. In the ensuing battle with Doomsday, Booster's costume is destroyed. Blue Beetle is able to design a new (albeit bulkier) costume to replace it, although this costume often malfunctions. During a later battle with Devastator, a servant of the [[Overmaster]], Booster is nearly killed and loses an arm. Again, Blue Beetle comes to his aid, designing a suit that acts as a [[life support]] system in addition to replicating the powers of Booster's previous costumes. This suit also includes a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] arm to replace the arm Booster had lost.

===''Extreme Justice''===
After the Justice League falls apart, Booster Gold joins [[Extreme Justice]], a team led by [[Captain Atom]].<ref name="dc-extr">{{Cite book|last=Beatty|first=Scott|author-link=Scott Beatty|contribution=Extreme Justice|editor-last=Dougall|editor-first=Alastair|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page=117|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=0-7566-4119-5|oclc=213309017}}</ref> While a member of this team, Booster makes a deal with the supervillain [[Hank Hall|Monarch]], who fully heals Booster's wounds so that he can once again remove his battle suit. Booster dons a new costume created by Blue Beetle with Skeets acting as the mainframe systems controller, who aids Booster and is even able to take control of the costume if Booster is rendered unconscious.

Following the disbanding of Extreme Justice, this suit is destroyed. A new costume is created by [[Professor Hamilton]], based on the designs of both the original 25th century costume and the energy containment suit [[Superman]] was wearing at this time. This costume is apparently later tweaked to resemble Booster's original costume more closely.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===''Infinite Crisis''===
====''Countdown to Infinite Crisis''====
After the events depicted in the [[limited series]] ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', in which [[Sue Dibny]] is murdered, Booster Gold hangs up his costume and retires from crimefighting only to once again assume the role to help Blue Beetle discover who is manipulating KORD Industries.<ref name="countdown">''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' #1 (May 2005)</ref> Booster is badly injured in an explosion at Kord's home, and it is revealed that his companion [[Skeets]] has been dismantled for its 25th century technology by the [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization.

====''The OMAC Project''====
[[Image:Boosterquits.jpg|thumb|Booster Gold's farewell to [[Fire (comics)|Fire]].]]
In ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' limited series, Booster Gold gathers the old [[Justice League International]] heroes to investigate [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]]'s disappearance. At the series' end, he is ruined physically and emotionally, having destroyed much of his gear in the fight against the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]]. He has seen his friend [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]] die in battle. He has discovered another friend, [[Maxwell Lord]], is responsible for killing Blue Beetle and that in fact, Lord has always hated superheroes. He has also lost his trust toward the other heroes of the DC Universe. In a moment of self-reflection, he realizes that if only he had bothered to recall more of what was history in his native era, he might have been able to warn his friends. Giving a farewell kiss to the forehead of his wounded teammate [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] as she lay in a hospital bed, he drops his trademark goggles on the floor and leaves, saying only that he has decided to "go home", the implication being a return to the 25th century.<ref name="omac">''[[The OMAC Project]]'' #1-6 (June–November 2005)</ref>

====''Infinite Crisis''====
In the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Booster Gold resurfaces in the ruins of the [[Justice League]]'s Watchtower on the moon, along with Skeets, again branded as a criminal in his time for "hijacking historical records".<ref name="ic2">''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #2 (January 2006)</ref> When Skeets fails to locate the absent [[Martian Manhunter]], Booster searches for [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]], the new Blue Beetle, whom he promptly takes to the [[Batcave]]. Booster tells [[Batman]] the subject of the stolen records: Batman never finds [[Brother Eye]]; but Booster implies that, with Jaime's aid, they can succeed.<ref name="ic5">''Infinite Crisis'' #5 (April 2006)</ref> The mission is successful and Booster plays a pivotal role in the destruction of the satellite.<ref name="ic6">''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (May 2006)</ref>

===''52'' and Supernova===
{{Main|52 (comics)}}
[[Image:Supernova (comics).jpg|150px|left|thumb|Supernova from ''52'' Week 35. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]
In the aftermath of the [[Infinite Crisis]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]] have temporarily retired their costumed identities, and the remaining heroes attend a memorial for [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] in Metropolis.<ref name="52w1">''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 1 (May 10, 2006)</ref> Booster Gold attends the memorial, but when Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman do not arrive as he expects, he suspects his robot sidekick Skeets is malfunctioning and becomes hysterical. After Skeets reports other incorrect historical data,<ref name="52w2">''52'' Week 2 (May 17, 2006)</ref><ref name="52w3">''52'' Week 3 (May 24, 2006)</ref> Booster searches fellow time traveler [[Rip Hunter]]'s desert bunker for answers, but finds it littered with enigmatic scrawled notes. Booster finds photos of himself and Skeets surrounded by the words "his fault" with arrows pointing toward them.<ref name="52w8">''52'' Week 6 (June 28, 2006)</ref>

Booster is seemingly angered when a mysterious new superhero named '''[[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]]''' appears in Metropolis. His reputation ruined by his various unscrupulous dealings in pursuit of publicity and sponsorship deals, Booster tries to regain the spotlight by containing an explosion, but appears to be killed in the attempt.<ref name="52w15">''52'' Week 15 (August 16, 2006)</ref> Skeets uses Booster's ancestor, Daniel Carter, to regain access to Hunter's lab, where he sees the photos and arrows pointing at him. Skeets traps Carter in a time loop in the bunker and sets out to locate Hunter himself.

Supernova meets with Rip Hunter in the [[Kandor|Bottle City of Kandor]], and Hunter examines a number of high-tech items Supernova has brought him. When Skeets discovers the two, Supernova reveals himself to be Booster Gold and fights him, revealing how he and Rip Hunter used time travel to fake his death and create a rivalry between Booster and himself as Supernova. Hunter and Booster attempt to trap Skeets in the [[Phantom Zone]], but Skeets appears to eat the subdimension and pursues his two adversaries through time.<ref name="52w37">''52'' Week 37 (January 17, 2007)</ref>

During the ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]'' miniseries, Booster appears at various points in time. He tries to steal a missile, but leaves after realizing that he appeared before it was launched. Booster later appears before [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]] and [[Natasha Irons]], stealing the nanobot missile they were about to use on [[Black Adam]], saying he needs it more than they and that it would not have worked for its original purpose anyway; Booster promptly disappears.<ref>''52'' Week 50 (April 21, 2007)</ref> During his time-hopping mission, he briefly stops in the far future, robbing the [[Dominators]] of an experimental weapon designed to deal with time travelers. Trying to explain his situation to the alien warlords, he makes them suspicious as they mistake his rant of "having to save 52 worlds" as a warning that the Earth and 52 unnamed worlds are going to invade them after Booster's raid.<ref>''[[Supergirl]] and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #29 (June 2007)</ref>

Booster returns to the present, using [[T. O. Morrow]] as bait to draw out Skeets. Skeets reveals itself to be [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] in disguise, having used Skeets' shell as a cocoon to evolve into a being capable of devouring the Multiverse. Booster and Rip flee into the timestream with Skeets' remains and return to the end of the Infinite Crisis.<ref>''52'' Week 51 (April 28, 2007)</ref> Rip and Booster witness the birth of the new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], made up of fifty-two identical worlds. Mister Mind attempts to trap Booster and Rip in the Phantom Zone which he devoured when it was turned on him, but is stopped by Supernova (actually Daniel Carter, who was saved from the time loop he was trapped in by Rip and given Michael's outfit), who restores the Phantom Zone to its original place. Mister Mind then devours years and events of each of the fifty-two worlds, altering their history in the process. The real Skeets gives Booster a pep talk which inspires him to stop Mind.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Booster travels to the day after the end of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' on [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|New Earth]], where he retrieves the Blue Beetle scarab from a younger [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]]. Using the scarab — along with Suspendium stolen by Rip Hunter, Skeets' mangled shell, and Supernova's powers — Rip, Booster, and Daniel trap Mister Mind inside Skeets and hurl it into the timestream, trapping Mister Mind within a repeating time loop of 52 seconds where he is captured by [[Dr Sivana]]. As a reward for helping save the Multiverse, Rip downloads Skeets' programming into a spare Responsometer. Rip, Booster, and Daniel decide to keep the existence of the new Multiverse a secret.

[[Will Magnus]] then repairs Skeets using the Responsometer, although Skeets has no memory of the last year. Meanwhile, Daniel Carter decides to keep the Supernova costume and begin his own superhero career. His resolution weakening with time, he starts using the suit to play video games instead, because he does not need to eat, drink, or sleep while wearing it.<ref name="52w52">''52'' Week 52 (May 2, 2007)</ref>

===One Year Later===
{{Main|Booster Gold (comic book)}}
Following the events of ''52'', Booster Gold returns in his second solo series with the first story arc "52 Pick-Up". Booster puts in a request to the JLA that they admit him and the group begrudgingly decide to monitor him over the next week. However, Rip Hunter informs Booster that history has become malleable after Mister Mind's rampage and [[Continuity changes during Infinite Crisis#Superboy-Prime's changes|earlier damage to the timeline]].

A new villainous Supernova arises after stealing Daniel's costume, and aided by evil time traveler Rex Hunter, intends to exploit weaknesses in history, keen on rewriting it and destroying the JLA (they are later revealed to in fact be working under the orders of the [[Ultra-Humanite]], [[Despero]], and [[Per Degaton]]). As Booster is thought of as a buffoon, the person or persons behind the altering of time will not suspect he is thwarting them, but Booster must maintain his poor reputation to protect himself from any time travel attacks. Booster's condition for following Rip's orders is that he may travel back in time to avert the death of his best friend, Ted Kord.

Despite Rip's objections, Booster and three [[Blue Beetle]]s team up to rescue Ted Kord moments before his death. They succeed, and the restored Blue/Gold duo deserts Rip Hunter to side with the Blue Beetles group. Rip Hunter retaliates by presenting Daniel Carter and Rose Levin, ancestors of Michael, with replicas of the Supernova and Booster Gold suit, stating that the Carter family's heroic legacy starts "right freakin' now."<ref name="BGv2 6">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #6 (March 2008)</ref> When time "solidifies" following the salvation of Ted Kord, and the other three Beetles return to their own times, Ted and Michael find that as a consequence of changing the timeline, the world has become overrun by Maxwell Lord's OMACs.

During a final battle between the remade JLI and the OMACs, the Time Stealers return and are defeated. However, Booster suffers a tragedy when he is unable to stop Ted from entering a time sphere with the [[Black Beetle (comics)|Black Beetle]] to change the past one final time, resetting history and sacrificing himself.

He is later transported to the [[DC One Million|853rd century]], where he faces off against Peter Platinum, a con artist who is attempting to do better than Booster at making money off of heroic acts. When he is able to return to the present, he is enraged by Rip's unsympathetic responses to what he has been through, and quits. However, after a conversation with Batman, where he reveals he knew about Booster's involvement in the crippling of [[Barbara Gordon]], the Dark Knight has long realised that Booster is not the fool he appears to be and offers his friendship. Booster resolves to continue working with Rip, even if it will not be "fun." Rip reveals that he has a way to make things easier: he is able to save Booster's sister Michelle from moments before she died, claiming there is a loophole due to Michelle being from the future. It is also revealed to the audience that Rip Hunter is Booster's future son: as Michelle and Michael go out to eat, Rip says "Keep it up, dad."<ref name="BGv2 10">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #10 (July 2008)</ref>

Recently, Booster has shown his dedication to the mission, as he now calls himself a "Time Master", the same as Rip Hunter, and taken on training his sister [[Michelle Carter (comics)|Michelle Carter]].<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #13 (December 2008)</ref>

===Blackest Night===
[[File:Black Lantern Blue Beatle (Ted Kord).jpg|thumb|Booster Gold in the sights of Kord as a Black Lantern]]
In a tie-in issue to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Booster was forced to face Ted Kord, reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]. First, being unavailable due to reliving Ted's funeral in the past, he returns to meet his ancestor Daniel Carter, only to find the crashed, derelict Bug at his house. Then, he finds the Black Lantern pummeling Jaime Reyes, Daniel, and Skeets.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #26 (November 2009)</ref> Attacked by him, he removes Daniel and Rose from the scene and heads to Kord Industries to collect special weaponry against the Black Lantern. He uses a special light gun designed by Ted to blast the corpse and separate the ring with light simulating the emotional spectrum.

Upon separating the corpse from the ring, he collects Ted's remains before the ring can reanimate them and takes them into the Time Sphere to Vanishing Point Fortress to lay them to rest there, and is somewhat relieved when Skeets uses the Fortress's special chronal surveillance equipment to display images of the days of Team Blue and Gold. Jaime promises to live up to Kord's legacy and eventually form a new Blue and Gold team. However, they find evidence at the warehouse of somebody else entering, even though the doors were genetically coded, with only two people cleared for access: Ted Kord and Booster Gold.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #27 (December 2009)</ref>

===Brightest Day===
Booster would next find his sister, missing since the events of the "Reality Lost" arc, living in Coast City mere hours before its destruction. Though unable to save her boyfriend, Booster and Michelle patched up their relationship, with her agreeing not to leave him. This arc would also introduce an older Booster Gold, the man that trained Rip Hunter and was the master of both Time, the [[Multiverse]], and [[Hypertime]]. Rip reveals that this Booster is not only his greater, but also has been watching Rip training the young Booster Gold, aiding him when needed. Older Booster also reveals that he is still married to Rip's mother, and that Michelle is with them in some unknown time.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #31 (April 2010)</ref>

In ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', Booster is part of the manhunt to bring the resurrected Maxwell Lord to justice. He finds Max but is beaten badly. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom find him just as Lord uses his psychic powers to the utmost to erase all memory of himself from the minds of the entire world. For some reason, Booster, Fire, Ice, and Atom are the only ones who remember Lord and see him in recorded images.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #1 (Early July 2010)</ref> Trying to convince Batman ([[Dick Grayson]]), Booster is horrified to learn that, thanks to Max, the world believes Ted Kord committed suicide. Fire, Ice, and Captain Atom are soon set up by Max to cut them off from allies, but, ironically, Booster is left alone because his reputation is already poor.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (Late July 2010)</ref>

===Return of the JLI===
The remnants of the JLI are, seemingly by chance, joined by the successors of Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes) and Rocket Red. Rocket Red declares the newly formed team as the new Justice League International, prompting Booster to figure out that Max Lord manipulated them to be together. Later, during the assault on Checkmate, Fire and Ice discuss how Booster Gold has become the leader of the team.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #4 (Late August 2010)</ref>

When Booster Gold's team member, Jaime, is kidnapped and tortured by Max, Jaime manages to send a signal to the rest of the JLI to lead them to Max's headquarters. The JLI arrives too late, and Jaime is shot in the head by Max with a gun blaster, killing him in the same manner as his predecessor, Ted Kord.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #19 (February 2011)</ref> Booster Gold is enraged and his team tries to take down Max, but Max escapes from the JLI using one of his headquarters' escape pods. The JLI carries Jaime to the land surface, where paramedics try to resuscitate him. However, their efforts fail as Jaime had already died.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #20 (February 2011)</ref> As the team deals with the loss of Jaime, Booster Gold blames himself for leading the team into so much danger, feeling his reputation as a joke makes him less trustworthy and he does not want to be the leader anymore. The rest of the team overhear his ranting and convince him that they believe in him, knowing what a hero he truly is. Booster Gold is still upset, saying they cannot win against Max, when Blue Beetle suddenly sits up, his wound healed, declaring he knows what Max's ultimate plans are and that they can stop him.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #21 (March 2011)</ref>

While the JLI learn that Jaime is alive, Batman and Power Girl come to join the team. Meanwhile, Max sends the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]] to attack the JLI.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #22 (March 2011)</ref> While the JLI are battling against the new OMAC known as OMAC Prime, Booster Gold locates Max's flying headquarters and attacks it to come face-to-face with Max.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> During the battle, Booster Gold pulled Max out of the headquarters and ends up falling to the earth. Booster Gold saves Max at the last moment, but Max mind-controls him until he is confronted by Captain Atom. Captain Atom forces Max to undo the global mindwipe. Max then teleports away to escape from the JLI. Afterwards, Booster Gold and Batman set out to re-form the Justice League International.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

===Flashpoint===
After the ''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' event, [[Rip Hunter]] informed them that someone snuck into their base leaving a message on the chalkboard.<ref>''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' #6 (February 2011)</ref> When Earth entered into an alternate timeline due to the machinations of the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], Booster Gold and Skeets awaken and are the only ones who remember in original timeline. Booster Gold travels to [[Coast City]], but US soldiers attack him mistaking him to be an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] threat. Skeets is damaged when Booster Gold is attacked by the military's Project Six, which is revealed to be [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].<ref>''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #44 (May 2011)</ref>

During the battle in Coast City, Booster Gold discovers that Doomsday is controlled by General [[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]], Booster Gold escapes from Doomsday and then saves a woman named Alexandra Gianopoulos from Doomsday's attack. Booster Gold learns the timeline has been changed, suspecting that [[Professor Zoom]] was behind it. Alexandra and Booster Gold split up, but she secretly has powers allowing her to take others' powers and follows him. Later, Booster Gold flies to [[Gotham City]] when Doomsday attacks him. General Adam's control link is destroyed by Alexandra in an attempt to rescue Booster Gold. Doomsday's true personality comes to the surface and he attacks Booster Gold.<ref>''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #45 (June 2011)</ref> During the fight, Doomsday beats Booster Gold nearly to death, but he is rescued by Alexandra. Booster Gold tries to prevent Doomsday from killing innocent people, and manages to put Doomsday's helmet back on. Doomsday's control is restored to General Adam, who grabs Booster, hoping to kill him.<ref>''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #46 (July 2011)</ref> Fortunately, General Adam takes Booster Gold back to the base for interrogation, allowing Booster Gold to escape when the sight of "Project Superman" causes Doomsday's true personality to resurface again. Alexandra manages to defeat Doomsday by using the control helmet to make Doomsday tear himself apart, subsequently asking Booster Gold to take him with her when he restores history to normal. However, Alexandra subsequently sacrifices herself to save Booster Gold from an Atlantean attack, leaving Booster Gold to return to Vanishing Point as history resets itself without any clear memory of his time in the "Flashpoint" universe.

At the Canadian Fan Expo 2011 during the Friday Flashpoint panel, it was revealed that Booster would be a Canadian character on the JLI team in the relauched DC Universe.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/08/26/lemire-robinson-and-azzarello-%E2%80%93-dc-bullet-points-from-fan-expo-canada/ | title=Lemire, Robinson And Azzarello – DC Bullet Points From Fan Expo Canada | work=bleedingcool.com | accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref> 

In ''Justice League International'' #1 of 2011 the new Booster Gold has returned to his original glory seeking personality, commercially marketing his image. He does, however, take his leadership role seriously. Booster is chosen by the U.N. to lead the JLI, selected for his PR sense, as well as appearing to be easily controllable.

==Booster's legacy==
Since his beginning, characters within the DC Universe have hinted that there is a greater purpose to Booster Gold than even he knows.

During the ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' event, [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] reveals to Martian Manhunter that Booster is descended from the Chosen, and that he must be protected due to his involvement in elevating the human race. In fact, it is revealed that Booster is destined to come to the past to protect him from an unknown event in the future.<ref name="bg25">''Booster Gold'' #25 (February 1988)</ref> In ''52'' Week 52, Rip Hunter and Booster's ancestor, Daniel, discuss Booster. Rip states that the moment Booster helped save the multiverse from Mister Mind would be remembered in the future as the start of Booster Gold's "glory years."<ref name="52w52"/> Later, in the new ''Booster Gold'' series, Rip hints at a "Carter heroic legacy."<ref name="BGv2 6"/> It is then revealed that Booster is important to the Time Masters, as he will train "the greatest of them all,"<ref name="BGv2 10"/> being the father and the teacher of Rip Hunter himself, who willingly chose, to protect his identity against other time-travellers, to pass down the history as the only loser of the clan. Despite the general world distrust of Booster, Rip Hunter and his future descendants are implied to know the truth, always honoring Booster Gold for his sacrifices.<ref name="bg1000000">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #1000000 (September 2008)</ref>

Due to the complicated Time-Travels mechanics, Booster's future self, "currently" operating from an unknown era with his time-travel educated wife, still watches over his past self and his son, making sure that Rip Hunter is able to give his past self proper schooling. The older Booster acts in total anonymity, and has access to other "time-lost" equipment than his suit, such as the seemingly destroyed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]'s "super-goggles".<ref name="BGv2 30">''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #30 (March 2010)</ref>

Due to a [[predestination paradox]], the future Booster is revealed to be a more experienced Time Master than his son Rip Hunter, but also that he tasked personally Rip Hunter to school his past self in time-travel to ensure their roles in time. It is also implied that the departure of the Hypertime concept, rather than a simple [[retcon]], is Booster's work, as in the future he tasked himself with the role of ''pruning out'' divergent timelines from each universe in the Multiverse.<ref name="BGv2 30"/>

==Powers and equipment==
While Booster Gold has no superhuman abilities (he relies on equipment), he is an excellent athlete. He has also demonstrated enough will power to use his Legion flight ring at range, a feat few have been able to demonstrate.

Booster Gold gained his "powers" from the artifacts he stole from a museum in the future. A power suit grants him super strength and wrist blasters allow him to project force blasts. The wrist blasters contain the primary controls and power supply for the suit as well as communications equipment to monitor communications [[Frequency|frequencies]]. Circuitry from a force field belt that is incorporated into his costume allows Booster to resist physical and energy attacks, and he uses the force field to repel objects with great force and generate a breathable self-contained environment. The force field centers on Booster's body, but can expand and even project outward. The costume's goggles have [[infrared]] and [[Magnification|magnifying]] capabilities as well. In addition to the powers from his suit, Booster can fly thanks to a [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] flight ring. Booster can also absorb mass and eject it either in its original form or as a melted mass,<ref name="BG 3">''Booster Gold'' #3 (April 1986)</ref> although this depletes his force field for a time afterward.<ref name="BG 7">''Booster Gold'' #7 (August 1986)</ref>

According to the third issue of ''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, Booster's original uniform included a cape which was taken by Superman after telling Booster, "You can't handle a cape." Booster's later costumes use many different technologies to grant him his powers, but the powers themselves remain basically the same despite changes to the source. Booster's third costume acts as a mobile life support system in addition to its granting him super powers.

As Supernova, Michael Carter uses a [[Phantom Zone#Post-Crisis|Phantom Zone Projector]] built into his suit to teleport matter from one place to another.<ref name="52w37"/>

Despite the fact that Booster stole the elements of his costume in the 25th century, recent Legion of Super-Heroes reboots and retcons depict them as having been invented in either the 30th or 31st century. Originally, ''Booster Gold'' #8-9 told the story about how the time bubble Booster used to travel from 2462 to 1985 was discovered in 2986 with pieces of Brainiac 5's force field belt aboard. This prompted Brainiac 5, [[Reep Daggle|Chameleon Boy]], and [[Ultra Boy]] to travel back to 1985 to investigate. In the process, they assisted Booster in foiling an assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]. Brainiac 5 left his force field belt and flight ring with Reagan and determined that these would end up being the ones Booster would eventually steal in 2462, thus completing the causality loop.

In the context of the "Threeboot" ([[Mark Waid]]) Legion continuity, it is revealed that in a sort of [[predestination paradox]], Booster's ring and force field belt were stolen by [[Rip Hunter]] and [[Supernova (comics)#Daniel Carter|Daniel]] in an attempt to reverse a "Time Stealer's" plan intended to erase Booster Gold from the continuity by damaging the Time Sphere held in the museum.<ref name="BGv2 10"/>

In the future, an older Booster will have access to "lost" technology, such as Superboy's super-goggles.

Booster's equipment includes:
*'''Legion flight ring''': The standard flight ring employed by the adult Legion of Super-Heroes member, made of a particular alloy named "valorium", bestows his/her owner with flight abilities. It is the only piece of equipment stolen from the Space Museum which has survived to the most recent version of Booster's suit unscathed. Its origins differ slightly between the 1987 and the 2008 series, but in both origins, it is revealed that the ring originally was the one held by [[Brainiac 5]], willingly given or stolen. In the alternate continuity of the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century]]'' series, Brainiac 5 himself arranged the events leading Booster into stealing a random flight ring, knowing about his heroic life in the 21st century from historical sources.
*'''Power suit''': In lieu of any metahuman powers, Booster Gold uses an advanced microcircuitry-powered all-purpose combat suit that allows him a wide range of options to use in combat. The suit bestows enhanced strength, at least twenty tons without exerting, and durability to his owner, and is extremely durable, very lightweight, and easy to wear. The suit itself is able to withstand bullets without losing its integrity (although being shot hurts). It is also equipped with a force field, courtesy of the Brainiac 5 belt, able to withstand powerful impact forces, such as a punch from [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], without any damage spreading to its wearer, and filtering atmosphere to allow the holder thrive in a no-air atmosphere and defending Booster from germs and pollution: this particular feature was later downtoned, as Booster prefers now engaging the shield only when necessary to avoid weakening his own immunity responses. Originally, it was the war-suit of an alien invader, put on display on the museum in which Booster stole much of his equipment. The suit was damaged by Doomsday, then replaced with bulky suits of armor and a variation of the "Energy [[Superman]]" energy-dampening costume. The current suit, a close replica of the original one, comes from the future; however, its origins remain unknown. In the alternate continuity of the ''Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century'' series, Brainiac 5 himself arranged the events leading Booster into stealing a huge array of power cells used by the [[Science Police]] to fuel his powered suit, knowing about his heroic life in the 21st century from historical sources.
*'''Time-travel circuitry''': Originally reliant to a Time-Sphere from chronal transportation, Booster Gold has shown during the ''52'' series the ability to travel back and forth in time on his own volition. His association with Rip Hunter came with upgraded time circuitry woven into his costume, allowing him to travel safely through the time-stream and sense and repair chronal anomalies, at the cost of a permanent link with Rip Hunter's equipment, to allow the more experienced time-traveler to provide counseling and guidance.
*'''Gauntlets''': Originally on display as the exotic weaponry of an alien warlord, and using the same energy cells of the suit, the gauntlets contain powerful blasters, able to plow at their maximum setting through two solid feet of concrete. In the alternate continuity of the ''Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century'' series, Brainiac 5 himself arranged the events leading Booster into stealing a pair of gauntlets built by [[LexCorp]], knowing about his heroic life in the 21st century from historical sources.
*'''Visor devices''': Booster's visor is outfitted with both sensory amplification devices (both auditory and visual) and a HUD for targeting and threat-identification, along with broad scanning along the electromagnetic spectrum, providing infra-red, ultraviolet, and X-ray vision. It is described by Daniel Carter as "lightweight as a pair of contact lenses", and although it has been shown as unable to protect his wearer by sudden flashes of blinding light, it provides a measure of protection.

After being infected and later cured of chronal leprosy, Booster's body now ages at a much slower rate than a normal human being.

==Enemies==
* '''[[100 (DC Comics)|The 1000]]''' - Vast criminal organization led by the '''Director of Death''' (secretly Senator Henry Ballard), they served as Booster's greatest thorn during his earliest adventures. Operatives included '''Blackguard''', '''Chiller''', '''Mindancer''', '''[[Shockwave (comics)#DC Comics|Shockwave]]''', and '''Doctor Shocker'''.
* '''Broderick''' - An agent for the United States in the 25th century that has been tasked on several occasions to apprehend Booster for his misuse of time travel technology.
* '''Time Stealers''' - A villainous counterpart to [[Rip Hunter]]'s ''Time Masters'', the Time Stealers are a group of time travelers that employ their technology for personal gain. Their membership includes '''[[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]]''' (controlling Jonar Carter donning the [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]] persona), '''[[Per Degaton]]''', '''[[Ultra-Humanite]]''', '''[[Despero]]''', '''[[Black Beetle (comics)|Black Beetle]]''', '''Rex Hunter''', an alternate evil version of time traveler [[Rip Hunter]], and evil tycoon '''[[Maxwell Lord]]''' along with his private android Maximillion,  modeled after Booster Gold's partner Skeets.

==Other versions==
As the series ''Booster Gold'' features time travel as a major plot element, Booster regularly visits alternate timelines where key events in history played differently. Occasionally, in ''Booster Gold'', and in ''Justice League International'' and ''Super Buddies'', alternate versions of Booster Gold from these timelines make appearances.

In ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League'',<ref>''JLA Classified'' #8 (August 2005)</ref> several "Super Buddies" visit an alternate universe where [[Maxwell Lord]] leads a violent super-team of [[Striptease|stripper]]s and male enforcers called the "Power Posse". An apparently unpowered and street-talking Gold serves as an employee. He is much more brutish, instantly [[wikt:pimp slap|pimp slap]]ping a female employee simply because Lord commands it. This alternate version of the Justice League International may be the same team as the [[Qward|Antimatter Universe]]-based [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate of Amerika]], which first appeared in ''Justice League Quarterly'' #8 (1992) sans Booster Gold,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://blaklion.best.vwh.net/timeline3.html | title=Earth-3 Timeline | work=Blaklion.best.vwh.net | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> but many of the events in this series do not seem to tie directly into continuity.

===Elseworlds===
In ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'', the sequel to the [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]] ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' [[Elseworlds]] series, Booster is the founder and owner of the Planet Krypton restaurant. He is also mentioned in ''Kingdom Come'' by Fire.

In ''[[Justice Riders]]'', a western take on the Justice League by [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[J. H. Williams III]], Booster Gold is a travelling gambler who wants to join Sheriff [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince]]'s posse. To counter the speed advantage of Prince's preferred choice, [[Wally West|Wallace "Kid Flash" West]], he acquires a [[machine gun]] from the eccentric inventor [[Ted Kord|Beetle]]. At the end of the story, once the Justice Riders have defeated [[Maxwell Lord]], Gold heads for Denver, where "the suckers come in by the trainload every day."

===One Million===
The [[DC One Million|One Million]] version of Booster Gold is a time traveler named Peter Platinum ("Platinum always beats gold") who appears in ''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #1000000. Based on Booster's reputation as a profiteer posing as a hero, Platinum admits to Booster that he is pulling the same scam, but more successfully, and assumes Booster is after a cut. His superhero gear is based on technology stolen from Rip Hunter, who has apparently had several encounters with him to get it back.

===''52'' Multiverse===
In the final issue of DC Comics' 2006–2007 year-long weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week 52, it was revealed that a "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]" system of [[Worlds of the 52 multiverse|52 parallel universes]], with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as "New Earth") had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce [[alternate versions of fictional characters]], hypothesize "What if?" scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories, and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity.

The 2007–2008 weekly series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' and its spin-offs would either directly show or insinuate the existence of alternate versions of Booster Gold in the Multiverse. For example, ''Countdown'' #16 introduced his evil [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]] counterpart, a member of the villainous [[Crime Syndicate of America#Crime Society of America of Post Crisis Earth-3|Crime Society of America]] — and a similar Booster Gold exists on the Antimatter Universe, as suggested in a 1992 ''Justice League'' comic book,<ref>''Justice League Quarterly'' #8 (Summer 1992)</ref> with Booster's evil variant first appearing in a 2005 ''Super Buddies'' story. The 2007 ''Countdown'' spin-off series ''Countdown Presents: [[Atom (Ray Palmer)#Identity Crisis and Countdown|The Search for Ray Palmer]]'' also featured a gender-reversed Earth-11 where, through character exposition, it is revealed that Maxine Lord (the female Maxwell Lord) murdered this world's female Booster Gold as opposed to its Ted Kord counterpart. The 1997 [[Tangent Comics]] [[fifth-week event]] (by Booster Gold creator Dan Jurgens) originally introduced an entirely different version of Booster Gold, a yacht-owning gentleman connected to the origins of the mysterious [[Green Lantern]]; when the Tangent Comics universe was later amalgamated into Earth-9 of the 52 multiverse, 2008's ''Tangent: Superman's Reign'' #1 (again by Jurgens) introduced an African American superhero by that name.

[[Image:Booster and skeets.JPG|right|thumb|Booster Gold and Skeets, as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
* Booster and Skeets appeared as members of the Justice League in the [[DC animated universe]] series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' voiced by [[Tom Everett Scott]], while Skeets was voiced by [[Billy West]]. Booster appeared in several episodes with non-speaking roles. He only spoke in one episode, "The Greatest Story Never Told", in which the entire episode focused on him. In the episode, a self-promoted Booster, who was excluded from the League's fight against [[Mordru]] and was assigned to [[crowd control]] during the battle, noticed Dr. Tracy Simmons', a physicist, experiment had gone wrong which caused her partner Dr. Daniel Brown, to uncontrollably walk around while having a [[Chunk (comics)|black hole on his chest]]. Booster desperately tried to stop Daniel on his own, but repeatedly failed. Realizing he could not be a hero just looking for fame, he decided to become a true hero and finally stopped Daniel and closed the black hole, which had almost swallowed the city. Despite finally being heroic, no one found out about what he did. Following Mordru's defeat, Batman approached Booster Gold wondering why he left crowd control. When Booster Gold is unable to explain what happened while the other superheroes were fighting Mordru, Batman tells Booster Gold that he will speak to him later. To Booster's gladness, he was asked out by Tracy on a date to thank him for saving the day. In his subsequent appearances in the series, Booster performs his duties in a more professional manner.

* In the first episode of 2006's ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' animated series, Booster Gold and Skeets make a cameo appearance as the janitors in the Superman museum.

* Tom Everett Scott reprises his role of Booster Gold, who appears alongside Skeets (West again), in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Menace of the Conqueror Caveman!".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0807/23/index.htm | title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Wednesday, July 23, 2008 | work=ComicsContinuum.com | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> He comes back 1000 years from the future to stop [[King Kull (DC Comics)|Kru'll]] [[Vandal Savage|the Eternal]], and teams up with Batman, believing this will increase his chances of having his own toy line, book line, and movie line. However, after Kru'll kidnaps Skeets (voiced again by Billy West), he sacrifices his glory to save his only friend. Booster ends up earning Batman's respect. In the teaser for "A Bat Divided!", he participates in [[Riddler]]'s game show "Riddle Me This", and Booster gets all the answers to the riddles wrong, harming Batman. Batman eventually frees himself and the two fight Riddler and his henchmen. Later, he appeared in "The Siege of Starro! Part One" where he and Skeets team up with [[B'wana Beast]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. They are the only ones who have not been brainwashed by [[Starro]]. Booster helped fetch the [[Metal Men]] for the final battle in "The Siege of Starro! Part Two". In "Menace of the Madniks!", it was revealed that Booster Gold was friends with Ted Kord before his death. During a trip to visit Ted Kord in the past, he ends up helping Blue Beetle fighting the Madniks when they break into S.T.A.R. Labs to steal the Quark Pistol. When Booster Gold shoots the Quark Pistol, it ends up knocking them out. When Booster Gold returns to the present, he finds Batman fighting an Energy Monster and Batman figures out that Booster Gold was behind this. When Batman and Booster Gold end up transporting back in time to see Blue Beetle, they end up going to Hub City Penitentiary where the escape of the Madniks causes them to turn into Energy Monsters that drained energy from the electric fence. Batman, Blue Beetle, and Booster Gold end up pursuing the Madnik Energy Monsters to Hub City's Nuclear Plant. Batman and Booster Gold managed to reverse the polarity of the Nuclear Plant in order to return the Madniks back to normal. He joins the Justice League International in "Darkseid Descending!" when it comes to the fight against the forces of Darkseid when they invade Earth. He later appears in "Shadow of the Bat!", where he and the rest of the JLI become trapped on the [[Justice League Satellite|JLA Satellite]] with the vampire Batman. He tries to use a garlic spray on the vampire Batman only for it not to work.

[[File:Booster Gold (Smallville).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Eric Martsolf]] as Booster Gold in ''Smallville''.]]
* Booster Gold appeared alongside Blue Beetle Jaime Reyes and Ted Kord in "Booster", the 18th episode of the 10th and final season of ''[[Smallville]]'', written by [[Geoff Johns]]. Booster was played by [[Eric Martsolf]].<ref name="smallville">{{Cite episode | title=Booster | series=Smallville | serieslink=Smallville | credits=[[Geoff Johns]] (writer); [[Tom Welling]] (director) | network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]] | airdate=2011-04-22 | season=10 | number=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | first=Eric | last=Goldman | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1107100p1.html | title=SDCC 10: Smallville - Darkseid, Blue Beetle and More Are Coming! | work=[[IGN]] | date=July 25, 2010 | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | first=Natalie | last=Abrams | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Smallville-Spence-Kord-1028188.aspx | title=''Smallville'' Exclusive: Sebastian Spence Cast as Ted Kord | work=TVGuide.com | date=January 21, 2011 | accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref> Much like in the comics, Booster is portrayed as a fame-seeking superhero from the future who travels back in time to become a superstar. His antics bring him into conflict with a young [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]], who has not yet taken on the Superman identity. After Booster's misguided heroics lead to an alien parasite bonding with a teenager named [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]], the boy attacks Booster. Booster is able to convince Jaime to fight the Scarab's influence, and the youth ultimately gains control over it. After his near-death, Booster confesses to Clark that he is a washed-up athlete from the 25th century, and that he had traveled back in time in hopes that he could take Superman's place in the timestream and thus become a beloved superhero. Realizing the error of his ways, Booster chooses to stay in the 21st century and help Jaime learn to use his powers for good. Skeets does not appear physically, but instead exists as voice speaking in Booster's earpiece from an unknown location. (An alternative interpretation is that the earpiece ''is'' Skeets.) Additionally, Booster is shown in possession of a [[List of Legion of Super-Heroes items|Legion Flight Ring]], which he admits he stole from a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. On the next episode, "Dominion", dialogue suggests that Booster has joined the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], and Tess Mercer is able to use the technology he brought from the future to aid Clark and Oliver Queen during their journey to the [[Phantom Zone]].
*[[SyFy]] has ordered a live action Booster Gold series with [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Andrew Kreisberg]] as executive producers with Berlanti production company [[Berlanti Productions]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/syfy-booster-gold-greg-berlanti-261801|title=Syfy Orders Script Based on DC Comics' 'Booster Gold' (Exclusive)|author=Borys Kit|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

===Video games===
* Booster Gold appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' voiced by [[Tracy W. Bush]]. He gives virtual tours of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and [[Gotham City]] and as a mini boss in duo mode of the H.I.V.E. Base Mission.

===Miscellaneous===
* In the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century]]'' series, based upon the [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|television series of the same name]], another incarnation of Booster Gold appears. This time, Booster Gold appears as a rather selfish and glory-seeking young hero, operating in the 31st century against a group of High-Tech thieves known as the "Scavengers", but really selling to the same villains he fights stolen technology in exchange for a complete payment of his father's gambling debts. Before the Legion can confront him about his thefts, Booster Gold, using a stolen [[Green Lantern]] ring with limited time-travel abilities, tries to follow the Chief Scavenger, escaping in a Time Bubble like the one often used by the main continuity Booster Gold. Before disappearing into the timestream, he begs the Legion to bring his love to his sister, "the only one who always believed in me." At the Legion's headquarters, Brainiac 5 reveals he had always known of the technology thefts of Booster Gold, but having read in historical chronicles how Booster Gold is destined to redeem himself acting as one of the greatest and selfless crimefighters of the 21st century, he arranges for Booster to find and steal easily the very items he needs to be an effective crimefighter: a Legion flight ring, LexCorp experimental blaster gauntlets, and power cells employed by the Science Police. This version of Booster Gold, resembling a teenaged Booster, always travels with a version of Skeets, resembling closely the advanced ''2.0 model'' built by Doc Magnus after ''52''.

==Reception==
