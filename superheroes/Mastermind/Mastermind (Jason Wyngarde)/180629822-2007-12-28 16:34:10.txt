'''Mastermind''' was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in  ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #4 ([[1964#March|March 1964]]). 

The original Mastermind was '''Jason Wyngarde,''' a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with the power to generate complex [[telepathy|telepathic]] illusions. He was a founding member of the first [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and later a probational member of the Lords Cardinal of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where he played an important role in the “[[Dark Phoenix Saga]].”

The visual appearance of Jason Wyngarde was originally based by artist [[John Byrne]] on that of British actor [[Peter Wyngarde]], who played the leader of the Hellfire Club in an episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.  Peter Wyngarde is best known for playing [[Jason King (television)|Jason King]], whose character visually resembles that of Jason Wyngarde a great deal.

After Wyngarde's death from the [[Legacy Virus]], his two daughters appeared, possessing their father’s illusion-creating abilities. One now uses [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|his codename]] and the other is known as [[Lady Mastermind]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nothing is known of Jason Wyngarde's life before joining the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. With Mastermind's help, the Brotherhood was able to take over a [[South America]]n country, with an illusion of thousands of soldiers. After the Brotherhood's defeat by the [[X-Men]], the group attempted to lure the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] to their cause. The Stranger, being an enigmatic cosmic entity, instead of a mutant, turned Mastermind into stone.

After the spell wore off, Jason joined Factor Three, an organization that attempted to take over the world. Factor Three eventually disbanded when their leader turned out to be an alien, instead of a mutant. Former members of Factor Three, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], joined with Jason to reform the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. 

This new brotherhood was looking for new recruits. Mastermind attempted to recruit [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to his group, but ultimately failed. Magneto returned to the group to resume his leadership and created Alpha, the ultimate mutant. This new creation of Magneto's turned the entire team into infants, including his master.

After being restored to adulthood, Mastermind became involved with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] during the famous "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]," in which he was largely responsible for turning [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] into Dark Phoenix. He did this through the use of his own powers and a mindtap mechanism created by [[Emma Frost]], which he used to project his illusion directly into her mind, causing her to believe she was a Victorian aristocrat, married to Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind) and the black Queen of the Hellfire Club. He eventually turned her against the X-Men. Cyclops attempted to free the Phoenix in a duel with Mastermind on the [[Astral Plane]], but was soundly defeated when Mastermind "killed" him during the fight, which Cyclops' physical body barely survived. But instead of binding the Phoenix to him forever, as Mastermind had hoped, the shock of Scott's psychic "death" broke her free from his control. Enraged at what he had done to her, the Phoenix reached into his mind and expanded his consciousness, literally making him one with the universe. This experience flooded his mind with images of the cosmos and left him catatonic.<ref>X-Men #134 </ref>

When Mastermind was able to regain his sanity, he sought revenge on everyone that caused him pain. He gave the final nudge to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] towards leaving [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] for the X-Men through subtly manipulating Rogue's rapidly deteriorating mental state, while at the same time inflicting nightmares on Mystique. He interfered with the engagement of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] and the wedding of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Mariko Yashida]]; although the former couple were subsequently married, the latter were not. Cyclops uncovered Mastermind's plot to trick the X-Men into believing that Pryor was the reincarnation of Phoenix and defeated Mastermind in a battle in the [[X-Mansion]] in which he had used illusion to manipulate the other X-Men into attacking Cyclops. Jason later sought the power of the Phoenix Force, but this time he had to face [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]; he was defeated.

Mastermind later died of the [[Legacy Virus]], but before he succumbed, he asked [[Jean Grey]]'s forgiveness for what he had done to her, unaware she had never truly been Phoenix. Nevertheless, she did forgive him, and he died at peace.  

After his death, Mastermind appeared in a flashback sequence in New Avengers #10 that implied that he, on orders of the United States military, was responsible for the creation of the Void, the murderous and all-powerful counterpart of the super-hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].

Mastermind's name and powers still live on through his daughters: ([[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] and [[Lady Mastermind]]).

==Powers and abilities==
Mastermind's mutant powers are of illusion casting. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, touch, smell, and/or taste things that don't exist. For this to work, these people have to be within a range of his powers. He is capable of affecting even telepaths as powerful as [[Professor X]]avier and [[Jean Grey]], although he required an amplifying device to manipulate [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]].

Jason Wyngarde was a slight man with matted grey hair. He frequently used his illusory powers to assume the appearance of a younger, more handsome man. In his favorite disguise, he sported [[Victorian era]] style whiskers.

===Ultimate Mastermind===<!-- This section is linked from [[Mystique (comics)]] -->
Mastermind has also appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. His look, however, has changed drastically. While 616 Wyngarde used to be of average build, with cropped black hair and long sideburns, Ultimate Mastermind is lanky and white-haired, sports sunglasses and ponytail and looks like a beatnik. Here too he appeared as a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. Currently he has taken Mystique's work to pose as Magneto in the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prison, though with the company of his girlfriend [[Stacy X|Stacy]].

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Jason Wyngarde was one of the many victims of Apocalypse's regime. He was a victim of the experiments of a time-travelling [[Sugar Man]], which left him mute, though he was rescued by a time-travelling [[Nate Grey|X-Man]], as well as Forge and Magneto. Years later, he joined [[Forge (comics)|Forge's]] ''Outcasts'', a resistance cell travelling under the cover of a theater troupe. He was ultimately killed by the bounty hunter [[Domino (comics)|Domino]].

===House of M===
Mastermind has been mentioned to be a business rival of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].

==In other media==
===Television===
Mastermind made a cameo in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' on a TV monitor, when Magneto is demanding for The Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants to be freed from prison ("The Prison Plot"). He projects illusions of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Psyklop]], [[Annihilus]], and Zarathos/Ghost Rider.

He appears with The Inner Circle/Hellfire Club in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men The Animated Series]]'' episode, ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'' parts 1-3. Wyngarde is also a member of the Mutant Resistance in the alternate reality shown in the first part of the episode ''One Man's Worth''.

In the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Mastermind (voiced by [[Campbell Lane]]) appears as an occasional lackey of Magneto. Despite often being bullied by Magneto, he seems to respect him to a point, and though he is hinted to be a shady character when left to his own devices, he is not particularly malicious. His most notable act was altering the memories of Magneto's daughter, [[Scarlet Witch]].

===Film===
In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', [[William Stryker]]'s son Jason (portrayed by [[Michael Reid McKay]]) is loosely based on Mastermind.

===Video Game===
Jason Stryker appeared the ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' (which filled in the gap between X2 and [[X-Men: The Last Stand]]) voiced by [[Steven Blum]] as a teen and by [[Grey DeLisle]] as a child. Jason taunts Nightcrawler saying that he left him to die. Jason later in the game tells [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] that there is an evil version of him at Alkali Lake too. He then helps Nightcrawler to destroy the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and sacrifices his life to do that.
