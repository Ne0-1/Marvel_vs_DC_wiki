{{otheruses3|Mastermind}}

'''Mastermind''' was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in  ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #4 ([[1964#March|March 1964]]). He was given his "real name," '''Jason Wyngarde''', by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]].<ref>"There's Something Awful on Muir Island!" ''X-Men'' vol. 1, #125 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1979).</ref>

The original Mastermind was a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with the power to generate complex [[telepathy|telepathic]] illusions. He was a founding member of the first [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and later a probationary member of the Lords Cardinal of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where he played an important role in the "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]."

The visual appearance of Jason Wyngarde was originally based by artist John Byrne on that of British actor [[Peter Wyngarde]], who played the leader of the Hellfire Club in an episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.<ref>Cronin, Brian. [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/03/30/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-44/ "Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed: #44,"] Comic Book Resources (Mar. 30, 2006.). Accessed Dec. 7, 2008.</ref> Peter Wyngarde is best known for playing [[Jason King (television)|Jason King]], whose character visually resembles that of Jason Wyngarde a great deal.

After Wyngarde's death from the [[Legacy Virus]], his two daughters appeared, possessing their father’s illusion-creating abilities. One now uses [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|his codename]] and the other is known as [[Lady Mastermind]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nothing is known of Jason Wyngarde's life before joining the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], except that he was a carnival mentalist. With Mastermind's help, the Brotherhood was able to take over a [[South America]]n country, with an illusion of thousands of soldiers. As a member of the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he aided [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in repeated clashes with the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #4-8; ''Journey into Mystery'' #109</ref> After the Brotherhood's defeat by the X-Men, the group attempted to lure the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] to their cause. The Stranger, being an enigmatic cosmic entity, instead of a mutant, temporarily turned Mastermind into stone.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #11</ref>

After the spell wore off, Jason joined [[Factor Three]], an organization that attempted to conquer the Earth. Factor Three eventually disbanded when their leader turned out to be an alien, instead of a mutant. They teamed with the X-Men to defeat the alien [[Mutant Master]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #37-39</ref> Mastermind was then captured by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but freed by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #59-60</ref> Former members of Factor Three, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], joined with Jason to reform the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

This new Brotherhood was looking for new recruits. Mastermind attempted to recruit [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to his group, but ultimately failed and wound up battling him instead.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' Vol. 2 #12-13</ref> Mastermind was also briefly held captive by the second [[Secret Empire]].<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #174</ref> Magneto returned to the Brotherhood to resume his leadership and created [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], but this new creation of Magneto's turned the entire Brotherhood team into infants, including his master.<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref>

After being restored to adulthood, Mastermind became involved with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] during the famous "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]," in which he was largely responsible for turning [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] into Dark Phoenix. He initially posed as Nikos, and began a romance with Phoenix.<ref>revealed in ''Classic X-Men'' #24</ref> Then, he manipulated her through the use of his own powers and a mind-tap mechanism created by [[Emma Frost]], which he used to project his illusion directly into her mind, causing her to believe she was a Victorian aristocrat, married to Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind),<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #122, 125-126, 129, 130</ref> and that she was the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. He eventually turned her against the X-Men. Cyclops attempted to free the Phoenix in a duel with Mastermind on the [[Astral Plane]], but was soundly defeated when Mastermind "killed" him during the fight, which Cyclops' physical body barely survived. But instead of binding the Phoenix to him forever, as Mastermind had hoped, the shock of Scott's psychic "death" broke her free from his control. Enraged at what he had done to her, the Phoenix reached into his mind and expanded his consciousness, literally making him one with the universe. This experience flooded his mind with images of the cosmos and left him catatonic.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #132-134</ref>

When Mastermind was able to regain his sanity, he sought revenge on everyone that caused him pain. He gave the final nudge to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] towards leaving [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] for the X-Men through subtly manipulating Rogue's rapidly deteriorating mental state, while at the same time inflicting nightmares on Mystique. He interfered with the engagement of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] by manipulating the X-Men into thinking Madelyne was the Dark Phoenix. Mastermind also ruined with the wedding of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Mariko Yashida]] by psionically compelling her to reject Wolverine. Cyclops uncovered Mastermind's plot to trick the X-Men into believing that Pryor was the reincarnation of Phoenix and defeated Mastermind in a battle in the [[X-Mansion]] in which he had used illusion to manipulate the other X-Men into attacking Cyclops.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #173-175</ref> Jason later sought to tap into the power of the Phoenix Force, but this time he had to face [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and was defeated. He was imprisoned with the delusion that he had achieved cosmic awareness.<ref>''Excalibur'' #26</ref>

Mastermind later died of the [[Legacy Virus]], but before he succumbed, he asked [[Jean Grey]]'s forgiveness for what he had done to her, unaware she had never truly been Phoenix. Nevertheless, she did forgive him, and he died at peace.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #17 (1993, Marvel Comics)</ref>

After his death, Mastermind appeared in a flashback sequence that implied that he, on orders of the United States military, was responsible for the creation of the Void, the murderous and all-powerful counterpart of the super-hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #10</ref>

Mastermind's name and powers still live on through his daughters: [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] and [[Lady Mastermind]].

==Powers and abilities==
Mastermind's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers are of illusion casting. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, touch, smell, and/or taste things that do not actually exist. He can also cause people to sense things in ways that they would not naturally; for example, he can make himself look and sound like a different person, or look and feel like a wall, or even seem invisible. For this to work, these people have to be within a range of his powers. Without artificial aids, Mastermind cannot cause only one person among many who are present to see his illusions. He is capable of affecting even telepaths as powerful as [[Professor X]]avier and [[Jean Grey]], although to manipulate [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]] he required an amplifying device called a "mind-tap mechanism" provided by the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] that enabled him to project illusions directly into the entity's mind, so that the entity "saw" them, and to monitor the entity's thoughts, both over great distances.

Jason Wyngarde was a slight man with matted grey hair. He frequently used his illusory powers to assume the appearance of a younger, more handsome man. In his favorite disguise, he sported [[Victorian era]] style whiskers.

===Ultimate Mastermind===<!-- This section is linked from [[Mystique (comics)]] -->
Mastermind has also appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. His look, however, has changed drastically. While 616 Wyngarde used to be of average build, with cropped black hair and long sideburns, Ultimate Mastermind is lanky and white-haired, sports sunglasses and ponytail and looks like a beatnik. Here too he appeared as a member of [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]'s Brotherhood, here called the "Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy". Currently he has taken Mystique's work to pose as Magneto in the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prison, though with the company of his girlfriend [[Stacy X|Stacy]].

Mastermind is later present, partnered with [[Pyro (comics)#Ultimate Pyro|Pyro]], when Magneto and certain Brotherhood members clash with the [[Ultimates]] at Magneto's base in the [[Savage Land#Ultimate Savage Land|Savage Land]].  After enthralling the [[Valkyrie#Ultimate Valkyrie|Valkyrie]] in an illusion of her greatest fear, he suggests that he and Pyro "play" with her while she is incapacitated (hinting at a [[sexual assualt]]) and indicates that he has done so with other victims.  Before either man can act on the suggestion, the Valkyrie awakens and uses her sword to kill Mastermind and [[dismemberment|dismember]] Pyro at the wrists.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #5</ref> Why or when he had abondoned his post at the Triskelion and the subsequent reaction of SHIELD realizing Magneto was no longer in custody is never shown.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Jason Wyngarde was one of the many victims of Apocalypse's regime. He was a victim of the experiments of a time-traveling [[Sugar Man]], which left him mute, though he was rescued by a time-traveling [[Nate Grey|X-Man]], as well as Forge and Magneto. Years later, he joined [[Forge (comics)|Forge's]] ''Outcasts'', a resistance cell traveling under the cover of a theater troupe. He was ultimately killed by the bounty hunter [[Domino (comics)|Domino]].

===House of M===
Mastermind has been mentioned to be a business rival of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].

==In other media==
===Television===
Mastermind made a cameo in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' on a TV monitor, when Magneto is demanding for The Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants to be freed from prison ("The Prison Plot"). He projects illusions of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Psyklop]], [[Annihilus]], and Zarathos/Ghost Rider. Magneto also calls him "The Maestro of Illusion".

He appears with The Inner Circle/Hellfire Club in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men The Animated Series]]'' episode, ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'' parts 1-3. Wyngarde is also a member of the Mutant Resistance in the alternate reality shown in the first part of the episode ''One Man's Worth''.

In the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Mastermind (voiced by [[Campbell Lane]]) appears as an occasional lackey of Magneto. Despite often being bullied by Magneto, he seems to respect him to a point, and though he is hinted to be a shady character when left to his own devices, he is not particularly malicious. His most notable act was altering the memories of Magneto's daughter, [[Scarlet Witch]].

===Film===
In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', [[William Stryker]]'s son Jason (portrayed by [[Michael Reid McKay]]) is loosely based on Mastermind. In this interpretation, he was once a student of Xavier's whose father wanted him to be "cured". Because Xavier was unable to do this, Jason used his powers to take revenge on his parents, driving his mother to suicide. Stryker subsequently had him lobotomized so he would only obey his orders, and used him in his plan to eliminate the mutant race. Jason appears as a crippled, wheelchair bound man, with atrophied muscle, a flaccid face and watery eyes. The lobotomy deprived him of free will and left him paralyzed, but his psychic powers are strong enough to control even a great mentalist like Professor X. His father extracts his spinal fluid and uses it to control his mutant minions. Under his father's orders, he tricks Xavier into using a modified copy of [[Cerebro]] to find all mutants and send telepathic screams that could kill them. [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] temporarily ended the illusion and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], disguised as Stryker, had him target all humans instead. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] breaks into Cerebro and starts a blizzard to freeze him and end the illusion. Shortly afterwards, the dam collapsed and the second Cerebro was destroyed, presumably killing Jason in the process.

===Video game===
Jason Stryker appeared the ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' (which filled in the gap between X2 and [[X-Men: The Last Stand]]) voiced by [[Steven Blum]] as a teen and by [[Grey DeLisle]] as a child. Jason taunts Nightcrawler saying that he left him to die. Jason later in the game tells [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] that there is an evil version of him at Alkali Lake too. He then helps Nightcrawler to destroy the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and sacrifices his life to do that.
