'''Mastermind''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s, all of whom are or have been [[supervillain]]s, who exist in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

The original Mastermind was a [[mutant]] with the ability to generate [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[illusion]]s.  He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' volume 1 #4 as a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].  He was later involved with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] during the famous "Dark Phoenix Saga", in which he was largely responsible for turning the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] into the Dark Phoenix.  During this time he used the name "Jason Wyngarde"; this may have been his real name, although some stories suggest that it was only an alias.  He later interfered with the weddings of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] and of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Mariko Yashida]]; although the former couple were subsequently married, the latter were not.  Mastermind died some years later as a result of the [[Legacy Virus]], in ''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #17.

Another character called Mastermind, unrelated to the original, appeared during the original [[Captain Britain]] stories published by Marvel in the [[United Kingdom]].  This Mastermind was an [[alien]] [[artificial intelligence]] that had been built by [[Captain Britain]]'s father, Doctor James Braddock, Senior.  Mastermind lived in the Braddock family's estate until it was reprogrammed by [[Kang the Conqueror]] and subsequently destroyed.

The original Mastermind was later revealed to have two daughters who both inherited his [[mutant]] power. Martinique Jason, a  [[brunette]],
first appeared in ''Wolverine/Gambit: Victims'' #2, where she teamed up with [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]; she later joined the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.  Regan Wyngarde, a [[blonde]], first appeared in ''X-Treme X-Men'' #9.

The different [[hair color]] and use of name initialy served to confuse readers. The next appearance of Martinique in the pages of ''Uncanny X-Men'' revealed that the two are different persons. They were established as half-sisters, rival claimants to their paternal legacy. Martinique uses the codename Martinique. Regan is now called "Lady Mastermind" to distinguish herself from her sister.
