'''Mastermind''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. The original Mastermind was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the power to generate complex [[telepathy|telepathic]] illusions. He was a founding member of the first [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and later a probationary member of the Lords Cardinal of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where he played an important role in "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]."

After Wyngarde's death from the [[Legacy Virus]], his three daughters appeared, two of whom possessed his illusion-creating abilities ([[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] uses his code name, while Regan Wyngarde calls herself [[Lady Mastermind]]) and third is the [[X-Men|X-Man]], [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]].

In 2009, Mastermind was named IGN's 98th Top Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/98.html Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde) is number 98] [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.</ref>

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in  ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964). He was given his "real name" of '''Jason Wyngarde''' by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].<ref>"There's Something Awful on Muir Island!" ''X-Men'' vol. 1, #125 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1979).</ref>

The name and visual appearance of Jason Wyngarde was originally based by artist John Byrne on that of British actor [[Peter Wyngarde]], best known for playing [[Jason King (TV series)|Jason King]], and who also played the leader of the Hellfire Club in an episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.<ref>Cronin, Brian.

==Fictional character biography==
Nothing is known of Jason Wyngarde's life before joining the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], except that he was a carnival mentalist. With Mastermind's help, the Brotherhood takes over a [[South America]]n country, with an illusion of thousands of soldiers. However the X-Men free the country, as Professor X sees through Mastermind's illusions, helping the X-Men when they believe they are trapped by a wall of flame.<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> As a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he participates in repeated clashes with the [[X-Men]]. He attempts to court his teammate the [[Scarlet Witch]], but his advances seem driven more by an unsatisfied need for love than by any true feelings for her, and she repeatedly spurns him.<ref>''X-Men'' #4-8; ''Journey into Mystery'' #109</ref> The Brotherhood attempts to lure the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] to their cause, but the Stranger temporarily turns Mastermind into solid matter.<ref>''X-Men'' #11</ref>

After the spell wears off, Mastermind joins [[Factor Three]], an organization that attempts to conquer the Earth. Factor Three eventually disbands when their leader turns out to be an alien, instead of a mutant. They team with the X-Men to defeat the alien [[Mutant Master]].<ref>''X-Men'' #37-39</ref> Mastermind is then captured by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but freed by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #59-60</ref> Former members of Factor Three, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], join with Mastermind to reform the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Mastermind attempts to recruit [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to his group, but fails and winds up battling him instead.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' Vol. 2 #12-13</ref> Mastermind is briefly held captive by the second [[Secret Empire]].<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #174</ref> Magneto returns to the Brotherhood to resume his leadership and creates [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants battle the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], but Alpha turns the entire Brotherhood team into infants.<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref>

After being restored to adulthood, Mastermind becomes involved with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], who conspire to capture the X-Men for their own uses. He initially poses as Nikos, and begins a romance with [[Jean Grey#Phoenix|Phoenix]].<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #24</ref> Then, he manipulates her through the use of his own powers and a mind-tap mechanism created by [[Emma Frost]], which he uses to project his illusion directly into her mind, causing her to believe she is living out the life of a Victorian aristocrat who was married to Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind),<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #122, 125-126, 129, 130</ref> and was the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. This turns her against the X-Men. [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] attempts to free Phoenix on the [[astral plane]], but Mastermind confronts him there and soundly defeats him. Instead of binding Phoenix to him forever, as Mastermind had hoped, the shock of Scott's psychic "death" breaks her free from his control. Enraged at what he did to her, Phoenix reaches into his mind and makes him experience godhood for a moment. This experience leaves him catatonic.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #132-134</ref>

When Mastermind recovers his sanity, he seeks revenge on everyone that caused him pain. He strikes down Emma Frost, leaving her comatose.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #169</ref> He unbalances [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s shared psyche with [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]], prompting her to leave [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], while using an induced nightmare on Mystique to let her know he is responsible.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170</ref> Next, since Phoenix is dead, he decides to use those closest to her as proxies for his revenge.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #175</ref> He disrupts [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s wedding by psionically compelling  his betrothed, [[Mariko Yashida]], to reject him and open up dealings with the criminal underworld.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172-173</ref> He manipulates the X-Men into thinking Cyclops's fiance, [[Madelyne Pryor]], is the reincarnation of Dark Phoenix, hoping to goad them into killing her before he reveals the truth. However, Cyclops recognizes the patterns of Mastermind's power, and the X-Men defeat him in a short battle.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #174-175</ref> Mastermind later seeks to tap into the power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], but is defeated by [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. He is imprisoned with the delusion that he achieved cosmic awareness.<ref>''Excalibur'' #26</ref>

Mastermind later dies of the [[Legacy Virus]]. Before he succumbs, he asks [[Jean Grey]]'s forgiveness for what he did to her. She forgives him, and he dies at peace.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #17 (1993, Marvel Comics)</ref>

After his death, Mastermind appeared in a flashback sequence that revealed that he was paid by the supervillain known as The General to put one of his illusions into the mind of [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], making the Sentry "...so scared to use his powers, [That] he'll think the world will be attacked by the devil if he does."  This would make Mastermind responsible for the creation of the Void, the evil counterpart of the Sentry, who is actually the manifestation of the inhibitions that Mastermind implanted in the Sentry to prevent him from using his powers.<ref>''New Avengers'' #9</ref>

[[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with [[Astra (comics)|Astra]] and mutated deformed versions of [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], Mastermind, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], all actually clones created by Joseph.<ref>''Magneto: Not a Hero'' #1-4</ref>

===The Daughters of Mastermind===
Mastermind's name and powers still live on through his daughters: [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]] and [[Lady Mastermind|Regan Wyngarde]]. Both appear to be stronger than the original Mastermind; Martinique can create city-wide illusions that even hypnotize people to believe they are in a whole new era and Regan's lethal illusions can continue even after she has been rendered unconscious.

The X-Man [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]]'s mother teleports herself to the Wyngarde Mansion, where Regan and Martinique are fighting one another. Pixie's mother claims Pixie is their sister, revealing Jason is her father.<ref>''X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mastermind's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power is to cast illusions. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, feel, smell, and/or taste things that do not actually exist. He can also cause people to sense things in ways that they would not naturally; for example, he can make himself look and sound like a different person, or look and feel like a wall, or even seem invisible. For this to work, these people have to be within a range of his powers. With artificial aids, Mastermind can cause only one person among many who are present to see his illusions. He is even capable of affecting telepaths as powerful as [[Professor X]]avier and [[Jean Grey]], although to manipulate [[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]] he required an amplifying device called a "mind-tap mechanism" provided by the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] that enabled him to project illusions directly into the entity's mind, so that the entity "saw" them, and to monitor the entity's thoughts, both over great distances.

Jason Wyngarde was a slight man with matted grey hair. He frequently used his illusory powers to assume the appearance of a younger, more handsome man. In his favorite disguise, he sported [[Victorian era]] style whiskers.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Jason Wyngarde was one of the many victims of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s regime. He was a victim of the experiments of a time-traveling [[Sugar Man]], which left him mute, though he was rescued by a time-traveling [[Nate Grey|X-Man]], as well as [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and Magneto. Years later, he joined Forge's ''Outcasts'', a resistance cell traveling under the cover of a theater troupe. He was ultimately killed by the bounty hunter [[Domino (comics)|Domino]].{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===X-Men: Noir===
Wyngarde appeared as a member of [[Alternative versions of Magneto#X-Men: Noir|Eric Magnus]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] of Mutant detectives in NY.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===House of M===
Mastermind has been mentioned to be a business rival of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].<ref>''House of M: Iron Man'' #01</ref>

===Ultimate Mastermind===<!-- This section is linked from [[Mystique (comics)]] -->
Mastermind has also appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. His look, however, has changed drastically. While 616 Wyngarde used to be of average build, with cropped black hair and long sideburns, Ultimate Mastermind is lanky and white-haired, sports sunglasses and a ponytail, and looks like a beatnik. Here too he appeared as a member of [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]'s Brotherhood, here called the "Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy". He replaced Mystique's role posing as Magneto in the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] prison, though with the company of his girlfriend [[Stacy X|Stacy]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #81</ref>

Mastermind is later present, partnered with [[Pyro (comics)#Ultimate Pyro|Pyro]], when Magneto and certain Brotherhood members clash with the [[Ultimates]] at Magneto's base in the [[Savage Land#Ultimate Savage Land|Savage Land]].  After enthralling the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Valkyrie|Valkyrie]] in an illusion of her greatest fear, he suggests that he and Pyro "play" with her while she is incapacitated (hinting at a [[sexual assault]]) and indicates that he has done so with other victims.  Before either man can act on the suggestion, the Valkyrie awakens and uses her sword to kill Mastermind and [[dismemberment|dismember]] Pyro at the wrists.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #5</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Mastermind made a cameo in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' on a TV monitor, when Magneto is demanding for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to be freed from prison ("The Prison Plot"). He projects illusions of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Psyklop]], [[Annihilus]], and [[Zarathos]]/[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. Magneto also calls him "The Maestro of Illusion".

* He appears with The Inner Circle/Hellfire Club in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' episode, ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'' parts 1-3 voiced by [[Nigel Bennett]]. Wyngarde is also a member of the Mutant Resistance in the alternate reality shown in the first part of the episode ''One Man's Worth''.

* In the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Mastermind (voiced by [[Campbell Lane]]) appears as an occasional lackey of Magneto, and a member of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. Despite often being bullied by Magneto, he seems to respect him to a point, and though he is hinted to be a shady character when left to his own devices, he is not particularly malicious. His most notable act was altering the memories of Magneto's daughter [[Scarlet Witch]] so that she believed that her father had brought her up when in reality he sent her to an asylum when he found himself unable to cope with her powers.

* Mastermind appears in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]'' voiced by [[Haruhiko Jō]] in the Japanese version and by [[Travis Willingham]] in the English dub. He is seen as a member of the Inner Circle where they manipulated Jean Grey. Many years later, Mastermind appeared in the form of Jun Sanada into working with Yui Sasaki. He also manipulates the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]] into thinking he is one of them. Mastermind was served in his plot to control humanity by Inner Circle agents Rat, Marsh, and Neuron. When confronted by the X-Men, Mastermind revealed his secret alliance to the U-Men and was the one who projected the image of Emma Frost to Cyclops in order to keep them into accepting Emma into their ranks. When the X-Men catch up to Mastermind after Rat's defeat, they find him near the body of Yui's son Takeo Sasaki as he plans to use him to warp reality so that it can be one where mutants rule the world. Mastermind begins his plot while Marsh and Neuron hold off the X-Men to buy Mastermind some time. Following the defeats of Marsh and Neuron, Mastermind uses an illusion on Cyclops revolving around Jean Grey blaming Cyclops for not saving her and all the mutants having been killed. However, the presence of the real Jean Grey appears and helps to break out of Mastermind's illusion by telling Cyclops to let go of the despair of losing Jean Grey. Mastermind is then killed by an out of control Takeo.

===Video games===
* Mastermind appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].
