===Charater history===
The original '''Mastermind''' ('''Jason Wyngarde''') was a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the ability to generate [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[illusion]]s.  He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' Volume 1 #4 (March 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. He was originally a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].

With Mastermind's help, the Brotherhood was able to take over a [[South America]]n country, with an illusion of thousands of soldiers. After the Brotherhood's defeat by the [[X-Men]], the group attempted to lure the Stranger, to their cause. The Stranger being an enigmatic cosmic entity, instead of a mutant, turned Mastermind into stone.

After the spell wore off, Jason joined Factor Three, an organization that attempted to take over the world. Factor Three eventually disbanded when heir leader turned out to be an alien, instead of a mutant. Former members of Factor Three, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], joined with Jason to reform the Bortherhood of Evil Mutants. 

This new brotherhood was looking, for new recruits. Mastermind attempted to recruit [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], to his group, but ultimately failed. Magneto returned to the group, to resume his leadership. Magneto created Alpha, the ultimate mutant. This new creation of Magneto's turned the entire team, into infants.

After being restored to an adult, Mastermind became involved with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] during the famous "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]", in which he was largely responsible for turning the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] into the Dark Phoenix. The Dark Phoenix sought revenge on Wyngarde, by making his mind one with the universe.

When Mastermind was able to regain his sanity, he sought revenge on everyone that caused him pain. He interfered with the weddings of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] and of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Mariko Yashida]]; although the former couple were subsequently married, the latter were not.  Jason later sought the power of the Phoenix Force, but this time he had to face [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]; he was defeated.

Mastermind later died of the [[Legacy Virus]], but before he succumbed, he asked [[Jean Grey]]'s forgiveness for what he had done to her, unaware she had never truly been Phoenix. Nevertheless, she did forgive him, and he died at peace.  

Mastermind was later revealed to have two daughters who both inherited his [[mutant]] power. 

{{spoiler-about|[[Avengers_(comics)#New_Avengers|New Avengers]]}}
Mastermind was just recently revealed to have manipulated the [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]] under orders from the mysterious "General", when he was still alive.

===Powers and abilities===
Mastermind's mutant powers are of illusion casting. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, touch, smell, and/or taste things that doesn't exist. For this to work, these people have to be within a range of his powers. Jason also has low-level telepathic abilities, which he uses to make the illusions even more realistic.

===In other Media===
The film [[X2 (movie)|X2: X-Men United]] featured a mutant named Jason with the ability to generate telepathic illusions.  This character was named Jason Stryker, not Jason Wyngarde, only shares a name and powers with the comic book character Mastermind.

In the animated series [[X-Men: Evolution]], Mastermind (voiced by [[Campbell Lane]]) appears as an occasional lackey of Magneto. Despite often being bullied by Magneto, he seems to respect him to a point, and though he is hinted to be a shady character when left to his own devices, he is not particularly malicious. His most notable act was altering the memories of Magneto's daughter, [[Scarlet Witch]].
