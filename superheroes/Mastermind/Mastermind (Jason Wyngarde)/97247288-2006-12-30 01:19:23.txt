'''Mastermind''' was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in  ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #4 ([[1964#March|March 1964]]). 

The original Mastermind was '''Jason Wyngarde,''' a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the power to create complex [[telepathy|telepathic]] illusions. He was a founding member of the first [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and later a probational member of the Lords Cardinal of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where he played an important role in the “[[Dark Phoenix Saga]].”

After Wyngarde's death from the [[Legacy Virus]], his two daughters appeared, possessing their father’s illusion-creating abilities. One now uses [[Mastermind (Marvel comics supervillainess)|his codename]] and the other is known as [[Lady Mastermind]].

==Character history==
The original '''Mastermind''' ('''Jason Wyngarde''') was a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the ability to generate [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[illusion]]s.  He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' Volume 1 #4 (March 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. He was originally a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].

With Mastermind's help, the Brotherhood was able to take over a [[South America]]n country, with an illusion of thousands of soldiers. After the Brotherhood's defeat by the [[X-Men]], the group attempted to lure the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] to their cause. The Stranger, being an enigmatic cosmic entity, instead of a mutant, turned Mastermind into stone.

After the spell wore off, Jason joined Factor Three, an organization that attempted to take over the world. Factor Three eventually disbanded when their leader turned out to be an alien, instead of a mutant. Former members of Factor Three, [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Unus the Untouchable|Unus]], joined with Jason to reform the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. 

This new brotherhood was looking for new recruits. Mastermind attempted to recruit [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to his group, but ultimately failed. Magneto returned to the group to resume his leadership and created Alpha, the ultimate mutant. This new creation of Magneto's turned the entire team into infants, including his master.

After being restored to adulthood, Mastermind became involved with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] during the famous "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]," in which he was largely responsible for turning [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] into Dark Phoenix. He did this through the use of his own powers and a mindtap mechanism created by [[Emma Frost]], which he used to project his illusion directly into her mind, causing her to believe she was re-living the life of one of her ancestors. Through this mental seduction, he eventually turned her against the X-Men, inducting her into the Hellfire Club as their Black Queen. Cyclops attempted to free the Phoenix in a duel with Mastermind on the [[Astral Plane]], but was soundly defeated when Mastermind "killed" him during the fight, which Cyclops barely survived. But instead of binding the Phoenix to him forever, as Mastermind has hoped, the shock of Scott's psychic "death" broke her free from his control. Enraged at what he had done to her, the Phoenix reached into his mind and expanded his consciousness, literally making him one with the universe. This experience flooded his mind with images of the cosmos and left him catatonic.

When Mastermind was able to regain his sanity, he sought revenge on everyone that caused him pain. He interfered with the engagement of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] and the wedding of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Mariko Yashida]]; although the former couple were subsequently married, the latter were not.  Cyclops uncovered Mastermind's plot to trick the X-Men into believing that Pryor was the reincarnation of Phoenix and defeated Mastermind in a battle in the [[X-Mansion]] in which he had used illusion to manipulate the other X-Men into attacking Cyclops. Jason later sought the power of the Phoenix Force, but this time he had to face [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]; he was defeated.

Mastermind later died of the [[Legacy Virus]], but before he succumbed, he asked [[Jean Grey]]'s forgiveness for what he had done to her, unaware she had never truly been Phoenix. Nevertheless, she did forgive him, and he died at peace.  

Mastermind was later revealed to have two daughters who both inherited his [[mutant]] power ([[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)]] and [[Lady Mastermind]]). 

{{spoiler-about|[[Avengers (comics)#New Avengers|New Avengers]]}}
Mastermind was just recently revealed to have manipulated the [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]] under orders from the mysterious "General", when he was still alive.

==Alternate Versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Jason Wyngarde was one of the many victims of Apocalypse's regime. He was a victim of the experiments of a time-travelling [[Sugar Man]], which left him mute, though he was rescued by a time-travelling [[X-Man]], as well as Forge and Magneto. Years later, he joined [[Forge (comics)|Forge's]] ''Outcasts'', a resistance cell travelling under the cover of a theater troupe. He was ultimately killed by the bounty hunter [[Domino (comics)|Domino]].

===Ultimate Mastermind===

Mastermind has also appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. His look, however, has changed drastically. While 616 Wyngarde used to be of average build, with cropped black hair and long sideburns, Ultimate Mastermind is lanky and white-haired, sports sunglasses and ponytail and looks like a beatnik. Here too he appeared as a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants, though his fate is not known.

==Powers and abilities==
Mastermind's mutant powers are of illusion casting. He can psionically cause other people to see, hear, touch, smell, and/or taste things that don't exist. For this to work, these people have to be within a range of his powers. He is capable of affecting even telepaths as powerful as [[Professor Xavier]] and [[Jean Grey]], although he required an amplifying device to manipulate [[Dark Phoenix]].

==Appearances in other media==
Mastermind made a cameo in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' on a TV monitor, when Magneto is demanding for The Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants to be freed from prison (episode "The Prison Plot").  He projects illusions of: [[Mephisto]], Psyklop, [[Annihilus]], and Zarathos/Ghost Rider.

He appears with The Inner Circle/Hellfire Club in ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men The Animated Series]]'' episode, ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'' parts 1-3. Wyngarde is also a member of the Mutant Resistance in the alternate reality shown in the first part of the episode ''One Man's Worth''.

The film [[X2 (movie)|X2: X-Men United]] featured a mutant named Jason with the ability to generate telepathic illusions.  This character was named Jason Stryker, not Jason Wyngarde; he only shares a name and powers with the comic book character Mastermind. It's speculated that Jason's middle name is Wyngarde (from his mother). He was the son of mutant-biased [[William Stryker]], and briefly a student of [[Charles Xavier]]. Even though Jason Stryker was a mutant, he hated his condition. Blaming his parents, Jason tortured them by creating visions in their minds, eventually driving his mother to suicide. His father retaliated by having him lobotomized, causing him to become more docile. William discovered that a chemical secreted by Jason's brain could be used as a mind-control serum. He had a tap device implanted into his son's spine, and used the fluid to force certain mutants (such as [[Deathstrike]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]) into his service. William later developed a plan to destroy all mutants using a reproduction of [[Cerebro]]. Jason was to use his powers to trick a captured Xavier into using the machine to locate all of the world's mutants, then concentrating on them hard enough to kill them. The plan was interrupted by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Magneto reassembled Cerebro to locate humans instead of mutants, then Mystique, disguised as William, informed Jason of the "change of plans". This too, however, was interrupted by [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and Nightcrawler, who rescued Xavier and foiled Magneto's plan. As the room began to collapse, Xavier, Nightcrawler, and Storm escaped, and Jason appeared to die.

In the ''X-Men: The Official Movie Game'' Jason taunts Nightcrawler saying that he left him to die. Jason later in the game tells Nightcrawler that there is an evil version of him at Alkali Lake too. He then helps Nightcrawler to destroy the Sentinels.

In the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Mastermind (voiced by [[Campbell Lane]]) appears as an occasional lackey of Magneto. Despite often being bullied by Magneto, he seems to respect him to a point, and though he is hinted to be a shady character when left to his own devices, he is not particularly malicious. His most notable act was altering the memories of Magneto's daughter, [[Scarlet Witch]].

(The more-handsome version of Mastermind from the Hellfire Club stories is a dead ringer for Jason King.)
