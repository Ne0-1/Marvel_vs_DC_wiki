Namorita is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine of the [[Marvel Universe]].  She is a clone of her mother, [[Namora]].  She is most noted for being a member of the [[New Warriors]], where she often double-teamed opponents with [[Nova (comics)|Nova]], and even briefly considered a relationship with him.

==History==
Namorita ("Nita") is a clone of her mother, Namora.  Namora was the first cousin of Namor, and like Namor was a hybrid by having a human mother and Atlantean father.  Being sterile, she could not reporduce as normal, which was creating tensions between her and her husband Talan.  Meeting the exiled Atlantean scientist Vyrra one night, who was exiled for the forbidden science of cloning, she saw it as fate that she would meet him that night of all nights and requested that he make a clone of her that she could give birth to.  After Nita was born Talan was killed by an Atomic explosion, causing Namora to take Nita to Lemuria to grow up.  Namora was later killed by [[Llyra]] by poisoning, as both were rivals for the same Lemurian prince's affections.  Llyra and Byrrah, another cousin of Namor, decided to use Nita in a plot against Namor, threatening Nita that they would destroy Namora's body if she did not lure Namor to them, who she had never met.  Namor and Nita would eventually unite to defeat Llyra and Byrrah, although Namor would be overprotective concerning Nita.  Namor decided to introduce Nita to his long-time friend Betty Prentiss, whome Nita would eventually consider a second mother and would even adopt Prentiss' last name while in the surface world.  Betty Prentiss would eventually be killed by another enemy of Namor's, Dr. Lemuel Dorcas.

Nita would eventually enter college.  During a college trip, she was forced to battle long-time [[Fantastic Four]] enemy, [[Terrax]].  She was soon joined by five other young superheroes, and after Nita and Nova seemingly killed Terrax by   removing him from contact with the ground, the six formed the [[New Warriors]].  When Namor soon afterwards decided to start a financial empire, Nita joined him.  Around Namor Nita was always deferential, but aropund the Warriors she would act tough.  When [[Night Thrasher]] eventually took a hiatus from the Warriors, Nita would lead the Warriors.  But the stress of leading the Warriors, learning her cloned nature, and running Namor during his absence proved too much.  At a dance bar she became drunk and left with the leader of the Poison Memories gang, who wanted to gain vengeance against the Warriors and took information he was able to steal from Nita's apartment to kidnap many of the Warriors' family members.  After the surviving family members were rescued, Nita left the Warriors due to her guilt over her involvement in the predicament. 

Nita would return to Atlantis, only to be denied entry as the rest of Atlantis discovered her clone nature.  This seemed to be the final catalyst for Nita, as an over-saturation of oxygen, plus DNA spliced into her by Vyrra at her creation caused her to metamorphisis into a closer version of the original Atlanteans, causing her to give herself the name Kymaera.  After adventuring some more with the Warriors she was captured by those who wanted to experiment on her, only to be rescued by Night Thrasher after receiving a tip from the Mad Thinker. One day, Namorita became covered with pus-filled boils. Her lover, Nova saw Nita in this hideous state and abandoned her. A crestfallen Namorita went to take a shower. To her surprise, during the shower her skin went back to its original pink tone. She also shed her pointed ears, webbed hands, and glassy black eyes. Namorita continued to mutate and developed new powers. She found that she could secrete burning acid or a paralytic toxin and could become transparent. After her breakup with Nova, Namorita briefly dated Johnny Storm (The Human Torch.) 
 Nita would continue to have off and on exploits with the Warriors whenever they would reunite.
