==Fictional character biography==
===The New 52===
Emiko is the paternal half-sister of [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] who is the illegitimate daughter of his father and [[Shado (comics)|Shado]]. She was kept secret from the Queen family by her mother, the assassin [[Shado (comics)|Shado]]. As an infant she was kidnapped by [[Simon Lacroix|Simon Lacroix / Komodo]], Robert Queen's former associate and was raised as an assassin, believing him to be her father. Upon her debut, Emiko watches as Komodo kills Green Arrow's associate Jax Jackson, and later reports that their other hostage Naomi Singh had managed to locate where Oliver Queen currently is.<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #18</ref> She later meets Green Arrow when she decides to help protect her father. <ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> Later after Green Arrow rescued Shado from [[Count Vertigo]], she confirmed to him that Emiko is her daughter and that his father Robert is her true father.<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #22</ref>

Emiko then appears during the Outsiders War storyline where upon hearing that Shado is accompanying Green Arrow she asked Komodo if it was true that her mother is still alive and is upset for having been lied to, but he tricks her into thinking that Green Arrow and Shado are only coming to take her away from him.<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #29</ref> Later after Robert Queen was injured during their pursuit of them, Emiko begins to realize the truth that she is actually his daughter, something which Shado confirms to which an angry Emiko exacts her vengeance by killing Komodo. Upon rejecting his position to become the head of the Outsiders Arrow Clan, Oliver offers that he'll take Emiko away from all of this for a fresh start, which Shado agrees as it is her choice to make.<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #31</ref>

Emiko decides to follow her brother back to Seattle as she recognizes that unlike the rest her brother had never lied to her<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #32</ref> and when he is attacked by the [[Longbow Hunters]] she introduces herself as the '''Green Arrow'''.<ref>''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #31</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
Together with her older half-brother Oliver, she infiltrated the docks to rescue kidnapped children. Black Canary appeared to help them and Emiko revealed she was a fan of Black Canary. All three then went back to Oliver's and Emiko's apartment where Dinah stayed for the night. Later that day, Oliver and the assassin Shado, the mother of Emiko, had a fight in Oliver's apartment with Oliver getting the upper hand. Oliver ordered Emiko to get out of the apartment but she instead, to Oliver's surprise, fired an arrow into his back. Emiko told Shado she had been waiting a long time for her mother to arrive. Together they got onto a boat, took Oliver's body with them, and drove away from the bay of Seattle out on the ocean. When in the middle of nowhere, they threw Oliver's body over the rail, deep down into the ocean. They then traveled to the base built on water called the Inferno, where Shado's masters, the criminal organization called the Ninth Circle operated. After Oliver turned out to be alive, Emiko conducted a plan for the Ninth Circle to capture Dinah, to stop them from going after her mother who had fallen on bad terms with the organization after her failed assassination of Oliver. They lured Dinah to the Inferno where Emiko managed to capture her. When Emiko and Shado were supposed to kill Dinah she instead rescued her revealing that she had been a double agent all the time. Moments later she met Oliver, who had infiltrated the Inferno, and told him she had been trying to help him all the time. She had slipped a homing beacon into his pocket when she dumped him into the ocean, thus helping Henry Fyff locate Oliver. She had also anonymously contacted John Diggle and had secretly revealed the location of the Inferno to Oliver. Furious over her daughter's betrayal, Shado took Emiko hostage, taking her with her in a helicopter as the Inferno exploded. Emiko returned to Seattle, now going by the name '''Red Arrow''', and saved Oliver, Black Canary and the Seattle Police Department from Scott Notting and the Vice Squad. Later she becomes a member of the [[Teen Titans]].
