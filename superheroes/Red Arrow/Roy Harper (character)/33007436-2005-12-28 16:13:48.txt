'''Arsenal''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]].  His real name is Roy Harper Jr., and was known for decades as [[Green Arrow]]'s [[teenage]] [[sidekick]] [[Speedy]].  He first appeared in ''More Fun Comics'' #73 (November, 1941), Roy Harper senior was a forest ranger who rescued a Navajo medicine chief from a massive forest fire. He then went back to the fire to look for more victims; He was never seen from again. Young Roy was barely two years old at the time, and Brave Bow, the man that Roy's father had rescued, raised the boy on the Navajo reservation.

Roy grew up with few friends. With so much time on his hands, he developed himself physically and learned how to use a bow and arrow, reaching a level of physical prowess and archery skill of someone twice his age. Green Arrow was Roy's idol, and the Emerald Archer learned of the boy. At an archery contest that Green Arrow was judging, Roy was given arrows with magnetized lodestone tips, which caused him to miss the elimination shot. Even through Roy lost the contest, he helped Green Arrow capture some crooks who were attempting a burglary of one of the reservations' main employers. The young archer got off a shot before Green Arrow – thus proving he was ‘speedier.'

Roy was asked by Green Arrow to become his partner, and when Brave Bow died, Roy became Oliver Queen's ward. Roy was given a costume and a set of trick arrows similar to Green Arrow's and became known as Speedy. The two embarked on a career of crimefighting.

==The Teen Titans==
A few years later, Robin, [[Kid Flash]] and [[Aqualad]] joined together to stop the menace of [[Mr. Twister]]. It was the first time the sidekicks joined forces. Their second meeting was more eventful: Robin, Kid Flash, Aqualad, now joined by [[Wonder Girl]] and Speedy, fought against their mentors, who had been possessed by the evil Antithesis. At this second meeting, the five youngsters decided to become a team... and the Teen Titans were born! Robin naturally became the leader of the original Teen Titans. 

The sidekicks would continue to operate with their mentors, as well as spending time with their peers in the Teen Titans. Speedy was, at first, only a reserve member. But after a bit of time, he became a full-time member, replacing Aqualad. It was at this time that he began dating Donna Troy. Alas, some years later, the team disbanded, after numerous changes. It was also around this time that Roy and Donna ended their relationship.

After the first incarnation of the team disbanded, Roy was in rough shape. His partner Green Arrow was broke, dating Dinah Lance ([[Black Canary]]) , and fighting less crime. Roy and Oliver began to drift apart, as Roy started feeling partially neglected by his guardian. It was at this time that Roy started experimenting with drugs. He took the trust money that Oliver had set up for him and spent it on heroin. Roy at first fooled Green Arrow into thinking he was working ‘on the inside' to bust up a drug ring. Soon enough, his secret was exposed. Black Canary and Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) helped Roy overcome his addiction.

==The Titans Regroup==
Soon after, Robin, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl, Speedy and [[Mal Duncan]] are lured to Titans Lair by a false distress signal , where they battle [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]], a villain seeking revenge on the [[Justice League]] through their sidekicks. Dr. Light is ultimately defeated and the Teen Titans reform for a time. They set up a new headquarters at Gabriel's Horn, a discotheque in Farmingdale, [[Long Island]]. The disco is a cover for their secret underground headquarters. With Gabriel's Horn, Roy is afforded an opportunity to have a steady gig for his rock group, Great Frog (in which he played drums).

This incarnation of the team didn't last long. Soon after an adventure with the Titans West team, the Titans disbanded once more.

==The CBI, Agent Roy Harper==
[[Image:Arsenal5.jpg|CBI Agent Roy|thumb|left]]

The next incarnation of the Teen Titans was gathered by [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], which Speedy was not to be a part of, although he did assist the team on various cases. At this time, however, Roy devoted much of his efforts as a counselor for various anti-drug programs. This led Roy to establish government contacts, and he started working for the federal government as a drug enforcement agent. This led to him becoming a CBI agent under the direction of [[Sarge Steel]]. While on assignment in the Orient, Roy met [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], who later had a daughter by him (unknown to Roy at the time).

===Finding Lian===
Cheshire eventually resurfaced in [[Switzerland]], as Wonder Girl assembled a rag-tag substitute Titans team comprised of Hawk, Robin II ([[Jason Todd]]), Flash, Aqualad and Speedy. During their confrontation, Speedy learned that he is the father of Cheshire's daughter, Lian. Speedy went to [[Hong Kong]] to find Cheshire and was allowed to hold his daughter, Lian, for the first time. 

Speedy later enlisted [[Nightwing]]'s aid in tracking down Cheshire. The two heroes try to prevent Cheshire from fufilling her contract, which is to assassinate various ambassadors to prevent a peace treaty from taking place. Speedy and Nightwing prevented one assassination attempt, but Roy is attacked and captured by Cheshire's friend Wen Ch'ang, who despises Roy as the man who represents Cheshire's one weakness. Nightwing tracked down Cheshire, stopped her bombing attempt of the peace treaty and was able to plant a trace on her. Nightwing tracked down and freed Roy, who battled Cheshire as she cursed herself for loving him. She gave Roy a slow-acting poison and left. As Roy recuperated in the hospital, Nightwing suprised him with his daughter; Cheshire left Lian behind and Roy is reunited with his daughter at last. 

Roy became a private investigator for a brief time in [[Los Angeles]], and returned to aid the Titans at Nightwing's request. He helped the Titans try to unravel the mysteries of the Wildebeest and fight a group of lycanthropic humans. After a series of adventures, Roy returned to his career as a CBI operative.

==Becoming Arsenal & Leading the Titans==
[[Image:Costume change.jpg|Arsenal First Appearance|thumb|left]]

Roy returned to the Titans after the team went through a series of shocking changes (including their abduction by the Wildebeest Society, the apparent deaths of [[Golden Eagle (comics)|Golden Eagle]], [[Danny Chase]], [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] and Raven; The emergence of the Team Titans and Lord Chaos and their subsequent battle). At this time, and with the help of technology made available to him by Steve Dayton, Roy adopted the new identity of Arsenal, now equipped with a vast array of high-tech weaponry.

[[Image:Arsenal4.jpg|Arsenal's New Costume|thumb|right]]
 
The Titans were pressured to place themselves under the government's watchful eye, due to increased public scrutiny. Sarge Steel was their chief liaison, and Nightwing stepped down as leader and allowed Arsenal to take command. Roy lead this new group of Titans, and was consistently challenged by the burdens of leadership. Eventually, each members' dedication to the team began to waver, and the team disbanded.

Around this time, Green Arrow became involved with a terrorist group called the Eden Corps. As he attempted to prevent their increasingly hostile acts, he became involved in a fight in a helicopter, armed with a bomb, in the skies of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. During the battle, the bomb exploded, with Green Arrow in the helicopter at the time. It appeared that Green Arrow had perished in the explosion. The news left Roy grief stricken. Connor Hawke, Oliver's son he had just became acquainted with, assumed the mantle of Green Arrow in his father's memory. He continued on various adventures as the Emerald Archer and has since found evidence that Oliver Queen may indeed be alive.

[[Image:Arsenal.jpg|Arsenal|thumb|left]]

Soon another group of Teen Titans emerged. This group consisted of a teen-aged Atom (de-aged by events in Zero Hour) and new heroes [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], [[Risk (comics)|Risk]], [[Joto (comics)|Joto]] and Prysm. The team was funded by Loren Jupiter, who had also funded a group of Titans during Roy's time on the team. Jupiter gathered together the original Titans – Nightwing, Tempest, Flash and Arsenal – to combat the threat of his bitter, super-powered son Jarrod Jupiter (Haze). New and old Titans joined forces to defeat Haze – but at a price; Joto lost his life and Arsenal felt responsible for his death. Arsenal remained with this new group of Titans for a time, but eventually left the group before it disbanded.

A galactic threat came to earth, reuniting former members of the Titans. The Titans gathered together to save their former member, Victor Stone ([[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]) – and prevent him from putting the earth in jeopardy. They came into conflict with their mentors and friends in the JLA, but were eventually able to come to a truce and save Cyborg while preserving the safety of the planet.

Shortly after, Arsenal came into conflict with [[Vandal Savage]]. Savage had discovered that both Roy and his daughter Lian were blood ancestors of his. Thus, their organs were suitable for him to harvest to prolong his life. Roy was able save his daughter from Savage's manipulations. After this adventure, Roy adopted a new look to reflect his Navajo heritage. 

The original five Titans then decided to re-form the team. Arsenal served as a full time member on the team, and resided at the new Titans Tower with his daughter, Lian.

==Outsiders==
Shortly afterward, A mysterious conglomerate known as Optitron offered to sponsor the Titans and [[Young Justice]] after summoning them to [[San Francisco]]. Before any decisions could be made, a mysterious cybernetic girl (known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]) from the future invaded the complex - and immediately engaged combat with both teams. With half the team out of commission, the remaining members tried to track down Indigo, but instead encountered a rogue Superman android which had been activated. Caught by surprise, [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]] has her neck snapped by the Superman android, killing her instantly.

Troia tried valiantly to defeat the Superman Android, but he released a deadly heat beam directly through her chest, killing her. Indigo arrived and shut down the Superman Android, leaving Arsenal and Nightwing to mourn the fallen Troia. At Troia's funeral, Nightwing declared to Arsenal that he is tired as seeing friends die and the Titans are officially over. 

A few months later, Arsenal persuaded the reluctant Nightwing to join a new proactive crimefighting team: [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].

His main assets are his expertise with ranged weaponry (i.e., firearms and bows) and his excellent physical condition.

===Outsiders, Continued===
Roy however, saw an opportunity. He accepted Optitron's offer and set about forming a new team: the new Outsiders. He began by buying a massive secret underground headquarters beneath New York City. It was originally built by eccentric millionnaire C.T. Wentworth to function as a fallout shelter during the Cold War. Roy outfitted the shelter with state-of-the-art equipment and began recruiting members for the Outsiders. He successfully coaxed the veteran Metamorpho as well as newcomers [[Grace (comics)|Grace]] and [[Thunder (comics)|Thunder]]. In a controversial move, he also decided to accept Indigo as a member. This girl android had been responsible for activating the Superman robot, but her memories were wiped clean and she convinced him that she wanted to atone for the horror she'd caused. 

Indigo's presence would prove to be a major sticking point for Arsenal's last recruit: Nightwing. The Titans' former leader was completely unwilling to renew his involvement in a team after such a devastating loss. Arsenal argued that the Outsiders were the next logical step for them beyond the Titans. And perhaps a team of strangers would operate more efficiently (and without the emotional attachments). Though Nightwing was still reluctant, he immediately rose to the call of leadership when Gorilla Grodd crashed a luxury liner into a [[New York City]] port. (''Outsiders'' v.3 #1)

Roy's short time with the Outsiders has been frought with pain. When the team was attempting to stop [[Brother Blood]] from activating a global network of sleeper agents, one agent was successfully activated and surprised Arsenal with multiple gunshots to the chest. (#5) Roy survived by was sidelined for months. In the interim, he assigned the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] as his replacement. (#8) He was hesitant to resume active duty, feeling afraid of his own limitations, but returned with encouragement from Nightwing. (#11) 

Not long after his recovery, the Outsiders took on a case which involved a child-slaver and molester named Tanner. One of Tanner's informants recognized Roy from years prior, and led Tanner to Roy's daughter, Lian. (#19) Lian's nanny was killed and the girl was branded with Tanner's mark. The Outsiders arrived just in time to save Lian and other children from being flown out of New York. (#20) 

[[Image:Raney arsenal.jpg|Arsenal Shooting|thumb|left]]

Oddly, his near-death from gunshot wounds saved his life when soon he met [[Deathstroke]]. The villain, Arsenal discovered, had been posing as [[Batman]] from day one and feeding him information. Deathstroke intended to kill Roy, but when he discovered the bullet scars on his chest, he figured Roy had suffered enough and gave him a "pass." (#21-22) About the same time, Arsenal was also kidnapped by Green Arrow's nemesis, Drakon. Drakon was working with the [[Riddler]] and he slit Roy's throat so that he would have to apply constant pressure or die. The Outsiders helped search for and rescue Roy. (''Green Arrow'' #49-50)

==Other Notes==
Since founding the group, he has maintained a "no-strings" sexual relationship with Grace. He has also admitted to sleeping with the Huntress. 

Roy might be Joining [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] again in the One Year Later storyline

==Awards==
The character of Arsenal was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Best Comics Character in 2002.

[[Image:Speedy5.jpg|Animated Speedy|thumb]]

Speedy has appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animated series]], where he is voiced by [[Mike Erwin]]. Although his real name is not given (unlike Beast Boy's name, revealed to be "Garfield" as in "Garfield Logan" in "Homecoming Part 2," or Robin's name, strongly hinted at throughout the series), his appearance is clearly based on that of Roy Harper. While not a member of the main Titans team himself, he appeared as a supporting character in the episode "Winner Take All," and fought Robin trying to convince him if winning is really that important. Speedy later joined up with the team's sister group, Titans East. As depicted in the series, Speedy is serious and businesslike, leading [[Beast Boy]] to comment on his similarities to Robin.  However, when he reappears in "Titans East Part 1," his personality has been changed to that of a bad-boy, refusing to apologize for buying fish tacos, which offends [[Aqualad]] to no end. He was mind-controlled by [[Brother Blood]] in "Titans East pt. 2" but saved by Titans West. 

Speedy has appeared in:

*Winner Take All
*Titans East Part I
*Titans East Part II
*Homecoming Part II(cameo)
*For Real
