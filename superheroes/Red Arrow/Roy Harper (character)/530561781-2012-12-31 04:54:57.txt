'''Roy Harper''' is a [[fiction]]al [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. He was known for over fifty years as [[Green Arrow]]'s [[teenage]] [[sidekick]] '''[[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]]'''. He first appeared alongside his mentor in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #73 (November 1941). The modern-day version, an early member of the [[Teen Titans]], later assumed the identity of '''Arsenal''' and became a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] under the guise of '''Red Arrow'''.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book| last = Wallace| first = Dan| author-link =| contribution = Arsenal| editor-last = Dougall| editor-first = Alastair| title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia| page = 26| publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]| place = London| year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1| postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Roy Harper was raised by Brave Bow, a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine chief after his father, a [[Park ranger|forest ranger]], died in a forest fire.

Under Brave Bow's tutelage, Roy became a remarkable archer, and, after Brave Bow's death, Roy was adopted by Oliver Queen, the [[Green Arrow]], and became the Green Arrow's sidekick, "'''Speedy'''."

===Teen Titans and Roy's addiction===
[[File:Green lantern 85.jpg|175px|thumb|left|''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #85, featuring Roy's addiction]]
[[File:Speedy Harper.jpg|Speedy, Roy's first superhero identity. Art by [[Tom Grummett]]|230px|thumb|right]]
Speedy joined [[Robin (comics)#Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]], and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] in the newly formed [[Teen Titans]], a group originally formed from the various "teen sidekicks" active in DC comics at that time.

Speedy was initially a successful member and began dating Wonder Girl ([[Donna Troy]]). Some time later, however, Roy's fortunes took a turn for the worse. The Titans disbanded, Roy and Donna broke up, and then Green Arrow both lost his fortune and began neglecting Roy. While the Green Arrow was away on a cross-country adventure with [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Black Canary]], Roy became [[Drug addiction|addicted]] to [[heroin]]; the [[Snowbirds Don't Fly|award-winning story]] played out in ''Green Lantern'' vol. 2, #85-86 in September and November 1971. Once Roy's secret was discovered, Green Arrow angrily punched him and then threw Roy out on the street. Green Lantern later found him and left him in the care of Black Canary, who stayed by his side while he went through withdrawal. Soon after, he had a confrontation with Green Arrow that caused the two of them to stop working together.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In addition to some brief adventures with later incarnations of the Titans in the 1980s, Roy also served as a government agent for a fictional federal agency, and as a private investigator, and went on a single mission with the [[Suicide Squad]] (vol. 1 issues 11-12).

===Agent of Checkmate===
While still helping the [[Teen Titans]] on occasional missions, Roy frequently worked as a counselor for various anti-drug programs. During this time, Roy established government contacts, and was soon hired by the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI, also known as [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]) as a drug enforcement agent.

Roy was given an assignment to go undercover and gain the trust of the villain [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]. The intention was to turn Cheshire over to the authorities, but the two fell in love and had an affair. Roy could not bring himself to turn her in, but he was concerned that his presence endangered Cheshire's life, so he left her, unaware that Cheshire was pregnant with his child.

Roy eventually learned that he was the father of Cheshire's daughter, Lian. He went on a mission with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (the former Robin) to track down Cheshire and prevent her from assassinating a group of diplomats. Roy was captured by Cheshire and then freed by Nightwing, who also brought Roy's daughter. Cheshire had left Lian in Roy's care.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Arsenal===
[[File:Arsenal1.jpg|thumb|175px|left|First appearance of Roy Harper as Arsenal. Art by [[Tom Grummett]].]]
Roy later returned to the Titans, and was appointed leader by [[Sarge Steel]]. At this time, he adopted the new identity of Arsenal, now equipped with a vast array of high-tech weaponry. When the original members of this latest incarnation of Titans left the team, he gathered new members and led them until the team disbanded.

Soon, another team of Teen Titans emerged. This group consisted of a teenaged [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] (de-aged by events in ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'') and new heroes [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], [[Risk (comics)|Risk]], [[Joto (comics)|Joto]], and [[Prysm]]. The team was funded by Loren Jupiter, who had also funded a group of Titans during Roy's time on the team.

Jupiter gathered together the original Titans (now going by the aliases of Nightwing, Tempest, Flash, Troia, and Arsenal) to combat the threat of his bitter, super-powered son Jarrod Jupiter (Haze). New and old Titans joined forces to defeat Haze – but at a price; Joto apparently lost his life, and Arsenal felt responsible for his death. Arsenal remained with this new group of Titans for a time, but eventually left the group before it disbanded.

Arsenal later came into conflict with [[Vandal Savage]]. Savage had discovered that both Roy and his daughter Lian were his descendants. Thus, their organs were suitable for him to harvest to prolong his life.

Roy was able to save his daughter from Savage. After this ordeal, Roy adopted a new look to reflect his Navajo heritage. Shortly after, the original five Titans decided to re-form the team. Arsenal served as a full-time member on the team, and resided at the new [[Titans Tower]] with his daughter, Lian.

===The Outsiders===
Later, a mysterious conglomerate known as Optitron offered to sponsor the Titans and [[Young Justice]] after summoning them to [[San Francisco]]. Before any decisions could be made, a cybernetic girl from the future (known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]) invaded the complex, and immediately engaged both teams in combat. With half the group out of commission, the remaining members tried to track down Indigo, but instead encountered a rogue [[Superman]] android, which had been activated. Caught by surprise, [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]] had her neck snapped by the Superman android, killing her instantly. Troia (Donna Troy's new identity) tried valiantly to defeat the Superman android, but he released a deadly heat beam directly through her chest, killing her. Indigo arrived and shut down the Superman android, leaving Arsenal and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] to mourn the fallen Troia. Shaken by these losses, Nightwing decided to officially end the Titans.

Roy saw an opportunity. He accepted Optitron's offer and set about forming a new team: the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He began by buying a massive secret underground headquarters beneath New York City. Roy outfitted the shelter with state-of-the-art equipment and began recruiting members for the new team. He successfully coaxed the veteran [[Metamorpho]], as well as newcomers [[Grace Choi|Grace]] and [[Thunder (comics)|Thunder]] into joining the team. He also decided to accept Indigo as a member. Even though she had been responsible for activating the Superman android, and ultimately for Lilith's and Troia's deaths, her memories were wiped clean and she convinced Roy that she wanted to atone for what she had done.

Indigo's presence would prove to be a major sticking point for Arsenal's last recruit: Nightwing. The Titans' former leader was completely unwilling to renew his involvement in a team after such a devastating loss. Arsenal argued that the Outsiders were the next logical step for them beyond the Titans, and that perhaps a team of strangers would operate more efficiently than a team with so many emotional attachments. Nightwing, while still reluctant, agreed to join and lead the Outsiders shortly after defeating [[Gorilla Grodd]].

[[File:Outsidersvol3.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Promo art for "Outsiders" (2003). Art by [[Tom Raney]].]]
Arsenal was shot in the chest while attempting to stop [[Brother Blood]] from activating a global network of [[sleeper agent]]s. He survived, but was sidelined for months. In the interim, he assigned the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] as his replacement. He was hesitant to resume active duty, feeling afraid of his own limitations, but returned with encouragement from Nightwing.

Not long after his recovery, the Outsiders took on a case which involved a child-slaver and molester named Tanner. One of Tanner's informants recognized Roy from years prior, and led Tanner to Roy's daughter, Lian. Lian's nanny was killed and the girl was branded with Tanner's mark. The Outsiders arrived just in time to save Lian and other children from being flown out of New York.

Oddly, his near-death from gunshot wounds saved his life when soon he met [[Deathstroke]]. The villain, Arsenal discovered, had been posing as [[Batman]] and feeding him information since the Outsiders began. Deathstroke and Arsenal fought, with Deathstroke intending to kill him, but when the mercenary discovered the bullet scars on Arsenal's chest, he figured Arsenal had suffered enough and gave him a "pass". About the same time, Arsenal was also kidnapped by Green Arrow's nemesis [[Constantine Drakon]]. Drakon was working with the [[Riddler]], and he slit Roy's throat so that he would have to apply constant pressure or die. The Outsiders helped search for and rescue Roy.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Infinite Crisis and One Year Later===
During ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Arsenal served as leader of the Outsiders while raising Lian as a single father. He was among the heroes gathered to defend [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] from an invasion by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] (see also: ''[[wikia:DC:Battle of Metropolis|Battle of Metropolis]]'').

[[One Year Later]], Roy attempted to keep the Outsiders running, but unfortunately they found themselves handling low-level criminals and making little difference in the world. When Nightwing and [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]] discovered a fellow hero as well as Thunder's father, [[Black Lightning]], was arrested for a crime he didn't commit, Nightwing helped in a rescue mission that ultimately failed. The Outsiders are believed to be dead. Arsenal soon realized he was not made for the life of a cloak-and-dagger hero, returning command to Dick and leaving the team.

===Red Arrow===
Roy was approached by Hal Jordan with membership in the new Justice League.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> While in battle, Hal referred to him as "Red Arrow" in an attempt to stop himself from revealing Roy's name (despite the fact that Roy's identity has been public knowledge for some time now).<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #4</ref> Roy accepted membership in the League and officially adopted the identity of Red Arrow, justifying it as a final "coming of age" and outgrowing his troubled relationship with his adoptive father, Oliver Queen (Green Arrow).<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #7</ref> Roy began an intimate relationship with his teammate, [[Hawkgirl]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> However, the two ended their relationship and Roy left the Justice League following a disastrous confrontation with the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]].

===Rise and fall===
Following [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]'s apparent death in ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Roy returns to the team after discovering that Hal Jordan and his splinter Justice League have been hunting down and torturing criminals.

Roy and Green Arrow manage to settle their differences and work together, but things start to fall apart as [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]] assaults Roy, cutting off his right arm with a poisoned, nanite-laced blade,<ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #5</ref> and then has the [[Electrocutioner#Lester Buchinsky|Electrocutioner]] set off a device to destroy [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], killing the young Lian.<ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #6</ref><ref>''Justice League: Cry For Justice'' #7</ref>

Roy wakes several days later, adversely reacting to his current condition and Lian's death, taking an angrier stance to the world. The flesh-eating nanites still dormant in his stump prevent him from getting a permanent prosthesis. He is given a removable, enhanced artificial limb, built by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Doctor Mid-Nite]]. The prosthetic limb is built to "work-around" the contaminated nerve endings, but increases his [[phantom pain]]. His pain and the [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] for Lian's death, bring Roy back to his former drug addiction, overdosing on painkillers and permanently locked in a state of delusional paranoia.<ref>''Justice League - The Rise of Arsenal'' #1 (2010)</ref>

Haunted by visions of his deceased daughter and his former pusher, Roy regresses to his identity of Arsenal, lashing out against his former friends and driving away his extended family, blaming Green Arrow for having stolen his vengeance by killing Prometheus and [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Mia Dearden]] for having left Lian by herself in the first place.<ref name="autogenerated1">''Justice League - The Rise of Arsenal'' #2 (2010)</ref> After a bitter meeting with Cheshire, Roy is unable to release the pent-up frustration for the loss of his arm, the death of his daughter, and his stress-induced [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]]. Roy leaves Cheshire behind, hallucinating that a dead cat is his daughter, taking out his anger against a gang of drug dealers and stealing from them to fuel his addiction. As a result, when [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] finds him delirious on the street, he's forced to bring him to a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] home, with [[Black Canary]]'s consent.<ref>''Justice League - The Rise of Arsenal'' #3 (2010)</ref>

Roy manages to escape the center, and sets off to break into the jail where the [[Electrocutioner#Lester Buchinsky|Electrocutioner]], the accomplice of Prometheus directly responsible for Lian, is held. Despite the intervention of Green Arrow, Roy cruelly butchers Buchinsky with his knives, then burns away his house and all his possessions, becoming a dark, broody vigilante enacting his brand of deadly justice on lowlifes and criminals.<ref>''Justice League - The Rise of Arsenal'' #4 (2010)</ref>

After being approached by Cheshire to help murder [[Deathstroke]], Roy apparently double crosses her and joins Deathstroke's new, villainous team of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]], although Cheshire mentally congratulates him for his performance.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #26 (August 2010)</ref> Upon returning to the labyrinth, Deathstroke reveals to them that his proceeding items were used to create a healing machine called "[[Methuselah]]" for his dying son, [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]].<ref>''Titans Annual 2011'' (July 2011)</ref> After healing Jericho, Deathstroke claims the machine can also resurrect the dead, offering Roy and Cheshire the chance to revive Lian. Cheshire accepts, but Roy refuses, finally realizing that he has just been punishing himself for his daughter's death all this time, and that Lian is in a better place. Joined by [[Tattooed Man#Mark Richards|Tattooed Man]] and [[Cinder (comics)|Cinder]], Roy fights the rest of the Titans in an attempt to destroy the Methuselah Device.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #37 (July 2011)</ref> The power source of the Device, a metahuman named DJ Molecule, is freed, and Cinder sacrifices herself to destroy the device. Roy lets Deathstroke go after he helped to save Jericho. Cheshire, Tattooed Man and Osiris leave, and Roy and Jericho decide to form a new Titans team, to restore the legacy Deathstroke besmirched.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #38 (August 2011)</ref>

===Red Hood and the Outlaws===
{{main|Red Hood and the Outlaws}}
A part of ''[[The New 52]]'', the book has changed Roy's history, including Lian's existence and his now uninjured right arm. It's revealed that during his time with the Titans he was called Arsenal, and called [[Dick Grayson]] his boss.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #6 (February 2012)</ref> Roy was [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]]'s sidekick, but due to unknown circumstances, Roy was kicked out of his position, and Oliver took the stocks that he gave him within Q-Core, leaving him to his own devices. Roy became a depressed [[alcoholic]] and death seeker who attempts to commit a variation of suicide by fighting [[Killer Croc]]. Croc figures out what Roy's doing, stops him, and gives him a pep talk, which Roy thanks him for.<ref name="rho3">''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #3 (November 2011)</ref> Soon after, Roy starts Recovery with Killer Croc as his sponsor.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #4 (December 2011)</ref> However, this does not keep Roy out of trouble, as he later ends up in an exotic middle eastern jail where he must constantly carry a weighed ball. This all resulted from helping a Middle Eastern nation overthrow a dictator. The now liberated people turned on Roy, and threw him in jail. However, he is quickly released by [[Jason Todd]] and, with the help of [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], they escape out of the country. Soon after, Jason helps him get up to speed on current events. Roy learns Starfire supposedly has forgotten the Teen Titans and attempts to jog her memory using Dick's, [[Garth (comics)|Garth]]'s, [[Cyborg (comics)|Vic]]'s, [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]]'s, [[Beast Boy|Gar]]'s and Dustin's names, only to result in boring her.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #1 (September 2011)</ref>

Roy is very friendly with Jason and has his back, but his care free personality has caused some friction, as he accidentally called the defeated reanimated corpses of Jason's All Caste Teachers and Friends, trash.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #2 (October 2011)</ref> He also has a bit of a prideful streak, as he complains that he feels emasculated by Starfire's rescue of the team from a huge monster.<ref name="rho3"/> But he's also shown that he has a more serious side, and is well prepared for a fight, as he takes on and defeats Crux, an altered human that was able to defeat Starfire herself. He's also shown a softer side, as he cradles Starfire and wipes away her tears when she's hurt. However, he keeps his carefree facade, saying that she shouldn't tell anyone because it would hurt his reputation.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #5 (January 2012)</ref> 

He and Starfire have recently become a public couple, which originally started with him asking her out to dinner during a mission in Gotham. <ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #8 (April 2012)</ref> Then with him referring to her as his girl afterward, and them seen sleeping together on another occasion <ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #10 (June 2012)</ref><ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #11 (July 2012)</ref>

====Notable changes in New 52====
Roy's appearance has changed drastically in the Relaunch, as he wears his hair longer than before and has highly detailed tattoos on both arms. The location of any more tattoos, if any, is currently unknown, and whether the apparent ones have any significance is also unknown. In his Arsenal Outfit he wears a variety of baseball caps, but beside that and the loss of his knife, he still has the same basic design, only with a smaller vest and two quivers, instead of one.<ref>[http://insidepulse.com/2011/07/30/dc-comics-relaunch-jim-lees-red-hood-the-outlaws-designs-part-of-batman-inc/ Rendering of Arsenal and the Team by Jim Lee]</ref> He acts as a humorous character with a lighter view of things, even in the middle of combat, though he is very serious when he wants to be. He has never been a father nor was he a heroin addict, but is now a recovering alcoholic with Killer Croc as his sponsor. He became a freelance freedom fighter before teaming up with Jason Todd, and considers Todd his only friend.

==Powers and abilities==
Roy Harper possesses no superhuman attributes, but he is a marksman of incredible accuracy. He is extremely adept at the use of the bow and arrow, as well as a wide array of weaponry. He also has the ability to take virtually any object and use it in combat as an effective weapon. Harper is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and he possesses keen analytical and detective skills.

In the Pre-Flashpoint universe he has been known to speak Japanese<ref>''Titans Annual'' #1 (2000)</ref> and understand Russian.<ref>''DC One Million'' #1 (1998)</ref> Before Flashpoint, after the loss of his right arm, Roy Harper received an advanced prosthetic, built by [[Cyborg (comics)|Vic Stone]], designed to loop around his damaged nerve endings and restore his usual degree of hand-to-eye coordination, albeit with the price of a constant [[phantom limb]] pain.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Equipment===
Before Flashpoint, much like Nightwing and other members of the Bat-Family, Roy's suit is capable of emitting an electronic pulse. It is unknown, however, whether or not his suit is capable of emitting only one pulse, like Batman's and Nightwing's, or several. After being [[dismemberment|dismembered]] by Prometheus, Roy returns to his original Arsenal costume: despite being unknown if he still carries the EMP device, the new costume comes along with an advanced prosthetic limb, shown as highly resilient to bullets and melee weapons, and nearly as mobile as his former biological arm. His enhanced limb comes with increased [[phantom pain]], bolstered if the fitting isn't done with the right alignment.

==Weapons==
As Speedy and Red Arrow, Roy uses a custom bow and trick arrows (with a preference for the more mundane kind as Red Arrow), mimicking his mentor Green Arrow. As Arsenal he's known to also carry guns and other kind of ranged weapons. Roy also has been known to use an M40A3 US sniper rifle with a [[Kryptonite]] bullet on at least one occasion. His original Arsenal costumes were equipped with other exotic weaponry including a boomerang and electrified bola. His current Arsenal costume, reflecting his angrier stance, is laced with several bludgeoning and cutting weapons, mostly knives and billy clubs, strapped to his limbs and back. Despite not being technically part of his "costume", Roy uses his prosthetic right arm only when acting as Arsenal, removing it while going incognito.

==Personal life==
Roy is proud of his Navajo heritage and has a tribal tattoo to represent it. He was adopted by Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) and became his ward/sidekick, but soon joined a rock band called Great Frog, and got addicted to [[heroin]]. After his recovery, Roy had a daughter named Lian, now deceased, whom he raised as a single father. Roy is a natural thrill seeker, who has many connections in the government and metahuman community. His income comes from his work in the government.

Roy's first known superhero relationship was with Donna Troy during the Teen Titans. Although short-lived, the pair has rekindled the relationship on multiple occasions over the years, particularly during their time with the reformed Titans. Roy had apparently intended to propose to Donna, but she rejected him because of a prophecy that the Titan [[Lilith Clay]] had made, which stated that Donna's red-haired husband would die. This however was not in-regards to Roy, but rather Donna's husband Terry.

Roy's other main relationship was with the assassin [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], who is the mother of his child. Roy would constantly flirt and buy drinks for women at bars and any social outing. When he formed the Outsiders, he had a fling with Grace Choi. At this time, it was learned that he also had a fling with the Huntress. His relationship with his JLA teammate Hawkgirl was strained because of his search for the missing Cheshire.

During the break given to the members of the Titans with Nightwing's exodus from the group to become Batman, Red Arrow spent his vacation with his child, and in the subsequent explosion caused by [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]]'s traumatic nightmare involving a Justifier helmet, Red Arrow quipped "Either that was an earthquake or one of my exes. Please don't let it be one of my exes."

==Other versions==
===Earth-Two===
The [[Earth-Two]] version of Speedy was a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and [[All-Star Squadron]] in the 1940s along with Green Arrow. Aside from their origin, having been trained on a mesa top together, their history nearly parallels the history of the [[Earth-One]] versions up until the point when Arrow and Speedy along with their teammates were thrown into various periods of time during a battle with the [[Nebula Man]]. He and his teammates were later retrieved by the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] and the [[Justice League]] in order to assist them in saving Earth-Two from the machinations of their old foe the Iron Hand. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' a new solitary universe was created at the dawn of time, a universe whose history fused together the histories of several universes, including Earth-Two. Whether he ceased to exist or exists only as an aspect of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|post-Crisis Earth]] has not been determined, although his mentor died during the final part of the Crisis defending the new Earth from the [[Anti-Monitor]].

===Bizarro World===
A [[Bizarro]] version of Arsenal appears as one of the heroes of [[Bizarro World]]. In addition to sporting a robotic left arm (as opposed to his right one), the Bizarro Arsenal is shown wearing a quiver filled with dead cats, which he uses as weapons.<ref>''Supergirl'' #50</ref>

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Roy Harper is a member of mercenary squad working for industrialist Oliver Queen. Very early in the story, however, Roy and his fellow mercenaries were killed by an unshown explosion set off by [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and a group of anti-Queen activists.  The explosion actually kills everyone in the facility save for Vixen and Oliver Queen, who is remarkably unscathed even though he had been standing right next to Roy, discussing the possibility of becoming a group of actual heroes rather than mercenaries, at the time the explosion went off.<ref>''Flashpoint: Green Arrow Industries'' one-shot (June 2011)</ref>

===Thrillkiller===
''Batman: Thrillkiller'' is an [[Elseworlds]] story set in the early 1960s. Harper is depicted as a biker who buys drugs in order to get friendly with schoolgirl Hayley Fitzpatrick (aka [[Harley Quinn]]), but a terrifying ordeal with drug runners leads him to alert the police after being helped by [[Batman]] and [[Black Canary]]. He is later shown practicing archery, though it is not clear if it is part of a rehab scheme or training for vigilantism.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Speedy's first animated appearance was in the Teen Titans segments in [[1967 in television|1967's]] ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' voiced by [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]] In those episodes, Speedy serves in the effective place of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Curiously, Green Arrow never appeared in the series.

* Speedy has appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animated series]], where he is voiced by [[Mike Erwin]]. Although his real name is not given, his appearance is clearly based on that of Roy Harper. While not a member of the main Titans team himself, he appeared as a supporting character in the episode "Winner Take All", and fought Robin, trying to convince him that winning isn't as important as he thinks. Speedy later joined up with the team's sister group, [[Titans East]]. As depicted in the series, Speedy is serious and businesslike as in his Arsenal years in comics. However, when he reappears in "Titans East" Part 1, more of his traditional bad-boy Speedy personality is seen, as he refuses to apologize for buying fish tacos, which offends [[Aqualad]] to no end. He was mind-controlled by [[Brother Blood]] in "Titans East" Part 2, but saved by Titans West. Speedy's bow was broken by [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] in "Calling All Titans". He was then overpowered by her. However, in the episode "Titans Together", Speedy somehow regained possession of his bow when he was freed from his suspended animation. Speedy has also made eight appearances in the comic book series based on the cartoon. His first appearance in issue #10 was a cameo. He made a reappearance with the rest of Titans East in #20 & #25. A super-deformed version of him posed as Cupid in #27. One of the two stories in issue #30 focuses on him and [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]]. Thus far, he and Aqualad both have made appearances in each tenth issue. He appeared in issue # 39 and after being struck by Larry's arrows falls in love with [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], similar to the comics. In issue #48 he appeared as Arsenal in an alternate reality in a group called the Teen Tyrants.

[[File:Speedy JLU.jpg|210px|thumb|Speedy in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Patriot Act".]]
* Speedy appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Patriot Act". There, Speedy states that he is Green Arrow's "ex-partner" when Green Arrow calls him "my ex-sidekick", and is visually designed as a slightly older, better built version of his ''Teen Titans'' incarnation (his costume is the same, and he is still voiced by Mike Erwin). This does not necessarily mean the shows are in continuity with one another, and may have been a nod to the Titans cartoon and nothing more, much like [[Michael Rosenbaum]]'s voicing of [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] in the ''Teen Titans'' episode "Lightspeed". Speedy's appearance is also a nod to the original [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]], who are the stars of this episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=6836 |title=DCU &#124; Comics |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref> Speedy and Green Arrow fail to stop the mutated [[General Wade Eiling]] even after using their "quantum arrow".

* Speedy appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Dawn of the Dead Man" voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. Batman, as a spirit, possesses Speedy to tell Green Arrow to dig up his grave. While Batman and [[Deadman]] deal with Gentleman Ghost, the two archers find his coffin and get the body out. They later fight against Craddock's army of the undead. He also appears in "Sidekicks Assemble" where he, along with Robin and Aqualad, go against [[Ra's al Ghul]]. It is shown that Green Arrow treats him badly, and the usually nice Speedy defiantly points this out at the end of the episode. This version is the stereotype of what kid sidekicks are, saying phrases like "Golly!" or "Holy [insert uncommon phrase]".

* Roy Harper is a major character in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series first as Speedy, then Red Arrow voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]].<ref>{{YouTube|id = ZiOjAmXDjW4|title = Comic-Con 2010: Young Justice & Characters}}</ref> In the pilot episode "Independence Day", as Speedy, he helps [[Green Arrow]], they join other heroes and sidekicks in the Hall of Justice for what he believes is the first step towards joining the Justice League. However, he forfeits his place as Green Arrow's sidekick and leaves his fellow sidekicks after he reveals he knows about the existence of their secret orbital headquarters, the Watchtower. When invited by Robin to join the covert team of young heroes, he refuses. In the episode "Infiltrator", Roy takes on the name Red Arrow when he starts operating solo and confronts Green Arrow's new sidekick [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Artemis]] In "Usual Suspects," Red Arrow finally gains membership in the Justice League, but upon gaining access to the Watchtower he infects the Justice League with [[Starro]] spores, revealing his identity as an unwilling traitor (controlled by certain post-hypnotic code phrases) and a Cadmus-made clone of the original, who is missing. 
* In [[Young Justice (TV series)|''Young Justice: Invasion'']], Red Arrow (the Roy Harper clone) has been continuing the search for the real Roy. He then returned to his apartment to find Cheshire there with their daughter, Lian Harper. It's revealed that he and Chesire were married briefly. In "Bloodlines," Red Arrow and Chesire infiltrate a temple in Tibet where they believe the real Roy Harper is hidden. After fighting through the guards, Red Arrow and Cheshire find the real Roy Harper cryogenically frozen and missing an arm (taken by Cadmus as a source of genetic material). In "Satisfaction," the real Roy Harper learns what had happened while he was on ice, takes a grudge on Green Arrow and attemps to take revenge of Lex Luthor. However, he surrenders after Luthor offers him a cybernetic arm to replace his missing one, and announces he now goes by the name of '''Arsenal'''.
