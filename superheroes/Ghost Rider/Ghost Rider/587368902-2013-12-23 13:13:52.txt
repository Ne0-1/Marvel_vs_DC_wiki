'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supernatural]] [[antihero]]es appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western comics|Western]] character whose name was later changed to '''Night Rider''' and subsequently to '''[[Phantom Rider]]'''.

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]''', who, in order to save the life of his mentor, agreed to give his soul to "[[Satan]]" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). At night and when around evil, Blaze finds his flesh consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields trademark blasts of hellfire from his skeletal hands. He eventually learns he has been bonded with the demon [[Zarathos]]. Blaze starred in the series from 1972–1983. The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990–1998) featured '''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle that had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance. Blaze reappeared in this 1990s series as a [[supporting character]]. In 2000s comics, Blaze again became the Ghost Rider, succeeding Ketch. Robbie Reyes will be the new Ghost Rider for ''[[Marvel NOW]]''.

[[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Matt Long]] played Johnny Blaze in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]''. Cage reprised the role in the sequel ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'' in 2012.

==Johnny Blaze==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)}}
Following the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, '''Johnny Blaze''', debuted in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (Aug. 1972), created by writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]], writer [[Gary Friedrich]], and artist [[Mike Ploog]]. He received his own series in 1973, with [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a considerably long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through issue #58. The series ran through in issue #81 (June 1983).

==Daniel Ketch==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)}}
The next Ghost Rider, a young man named Daniel Ketch, debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3, #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather [[leather jacket|biker jacket]] with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon — who in vol. 2, #91 (Dec. 1997) is revealed to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment — are cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume One (1990-1998)|Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as ''Ghost Rider Finale'' (Jan. 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished #94.<ref>While the [[trademarked]] cover logo reads ''Ghost Rider'' #94, the comic's postal [[indicia (publishing)|indicia]] lists the comic [[copyrighted]] as ''Ghost Rider Finale''.</ref>

==Alejandra==
During the [[2011 in comics|2011]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]] story arc "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" in several Marvel Comics titles, a Nicaraguan woman named Alejandra becomes Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam, in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 7, #1. Though she demonstrated many previous unknown powers of the Ghost Rider entity, she was deprived of its full power when Johnny Blaze (see above) took back most of this power.

==Robbie Reyes==
Marvel announced at the 2013 [[New York Comic Con]] that a new ''Ghost Rider'' series with a new character named [[Robbie Reyes]] taking the mantle. He will be using a car instead of a motorcycle and live in [[East Los Angeles|East LA]]. <ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/21337/nycc_2013_all-new_ghost_rider NYCC 2013: All-New Ghost Rider]</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal superhuman being with a flaming skull and supernatural powers. The motorcycles he rides can travel faster than conventional motorcycles and can perform such seemingly impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across the surface of water and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles could not match. The Ghost Riders are virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are seen to melt while in their body).<ref>''[[Ghost Rider (film)]]''</ref> It is possible that they are genuinely immortal; it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heavens On Fire'' #6</ref> Despite being composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons (50,000 lbs)  (or more as seen in [[World War Hulk]]).<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #4</ref> The Spirits of Vengeance were beings of awesome power whose strength was matched only by the greatest of demons, it can be assumed that the Ghost Riders possess this same strength, which potentially rivals that of the Hulk. They also possess heightened reflexes which greatly amplifies their performance as motorcyclists. But a Ghost Rider's powers are more of a curse until they learn to control it, at which point it becomes a source of power.

Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him or her.

* '''Johnny Blaze''' – Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. Hellfire "burns the soul" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the "Penance Stare." In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During "World War Hulk" it was stated by [[Doctor Strange]] that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the "[[Green Scar]]" persona of [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and could possibly defeat him. However, Ghost Rider is defeated and Johnny Blaze knocked out. Zarathos himself then emerges and rides off because (as Dr. Strange stated) Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics Blaze's Ghost Rider has been given the "Penance Stare" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. He also now has new abilities including hellfire breath and the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest. He is also now able to travel between the incorporeal realms.

* '''Daniel Ketch''' – When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains, gray leather pants and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional into a high-tech motorcycle (This transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he found in the cemetery as he was once seen to be able to transform another cycle in "Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness"). Along with flaming wheels that allows the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the ''Penance Stare.'' By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. This ability was seen to have little effect on some people who were mentally unstable (such as the being known as [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]. Ghost Rider was also knocked out when attempting to use the Penance Stare on [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]). In the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, this ability was shown to be powerful enough to bring down the mighty Galactus, as Ghost Rider forced Galactus to feel the pain of all those who had died as a result of his feeding on their planets. As Ghost Rider put it "A billion billion souls". This display of power, though,  appeared to simply be a rewrite for the animated series, as the original story line in Fantastic Four issue 243, has Doctor Strange casting a spell that causes all of the souls of those Galactus has killed by his feedings to be visited upon him, at once. Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when "innocent blood was spilled" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap, but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone.

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==

===Vengeance===
{{main|Vengeance (comics)}}

'''Michael Badilino''', an ex-member of the [[New York City Police Department]], is one third of an "Organic Medallion of Power"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.

===The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance===
Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat.  Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, of which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.

===''Trail of Tears''===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the [[limited series|miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears'' #1–6 (April–Sept. 2007) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]]. Set during the [[American Civil War]], it finds Confederate officer '''Travis Parham''' avenging the murders of his friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Ghost Rider made his debut in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' volume 2, #2.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22449 CCC09: Ultimate Marvel Panel Report], [[Comic Book Resources]], August 7, 2009</ref> Ultimate Ghost Rider's origin is explained in "[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]" volume 2, #4. Young twenty-something couple [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and [[Roxanne Simpson]] decided on a cross-country trip across the United States. One day they came across a bar where they befriended a biker gang, who kept buying them beer. The friendship was a ruse as they killed an intoxicated Blaze as part of a Satanic ritual. During the ritual, they bartered their souls with Satan in exchange for wealth and power. Satan granted their request but kept the upper hand. The deceased Blaze also made a deal that [[Mephisto (comics)|Satan]] will get his soul in exchange for the assured safety of Roxanne. For twenty years Blaze trained to become the Ghost Rider, burning away his Christian baptism and searing away anything that was soft on the inside, and was sent into the world to get his revenge. He tracked down and killed the members of the motorcycle gang—now rich and in positions of power—individually. Due to these deaths, an executive order comes down from the White House: kill the Ghost Rider. The Avengers are recruited into the mission with no knowledge of the Ghost Rider except that he is 7' tall and has the strength of Thor.<ref>[[Millar, Mark]]. ''Ultimate Comics Avengers 2'' #3 (Aug. 2010)</ref> When the Avengers were unsuccessful in stopping the Ghost Rider from killing his next target, the truth behind the Ghost Rider is learned, and the leader of the motorcycle gang is now the Vice-President of the United States, [[Vengeance (comics)|Michael Blackthorne]]. The Vice-President sold his soul to become a Ghost Rider, AKA [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]], and the two get into a fight which the Avengers are unable to stop. Johnny drags the Vice-President into a church which turns them both back into human form, allowing the [[Punisher]] to finish off the Vice-President. Pleading his case, Johnny is allowed to leave. He is later seen in a park with Satan watching Roxanne, who was brought back to life with no memory of what was done. Satan agrees to let her live her life if Johnny continues to be his Ghost Rider, to which he agrees.<ref>''Ultimate Comics Avengers 2'' #6 (Sept. 2010)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ghost Rider made a cameo appearance in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' in "The Prison Plot" as one of the illusions shown by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].
* Ghost Rider has appeared in the ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series on [[United Paramount Network|UPN]], and in the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "When Calls [[Galactus]]." [[Richard Grieco]] provided Ghost Rider's voice on both occasions. He used the penance stare both times so it is more likely it is the Daniel Ketch version.
** It was due to his usage on the UPN cartoons that caused a planned appearance on ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' to be rejected.  The episode would have pitted Ghost Rider and Spider-Man against [[Mysterio]] and [[Dormammu]].<ref>http://members.aol.com/drg4/semper.html</ref>
