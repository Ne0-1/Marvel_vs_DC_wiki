'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supernatural]] [[antihero]]es appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western fiction|Western]] character whose name was later changed to '''Night Rider''' and subsequently to '''[[Phantom Rider]]'''.

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]''', who, in order to save the life of his mentor, agreed to give his soul to "[[Satan]]" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). Instead, his soul bonded with the entity called [[Zarathos]]. When utilizing Zarathos' powers Blaze's flesh is consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields trademark blasts of hellfire from his skeletal hands. He starred in the series from 1972-1983.

The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990-98) featured '''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle which had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a "Spirit of Vengeance". 

Johnny Blaze reappeared in this 1990s series as a [[supporting character]]. In mid-2000s comics, Blaze again became the Ghost Rider, succeeding Ketch.

[[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Matt Long]] played Johnny Blaze in the [[2007]] film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]''.

==Johnny Blaze==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)}}
After the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, the most well-known Ghost Rider was created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Roy Thomas]], with writer [[Gary Friedrich]], and [[artist]] [[Mike Ploog]], in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (Aug. 1972).  Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt performer in a traveling circus, sold his soul to who he believes was [[Satan]] but actually is the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (a [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]), in order to save his stepfather, "Crash" Simpson, from cancer. Crash later dies in a motorcycle accident and Mephisto attempts to take Blaze's soul, only to be thwarted by Crash's daughter Roxanne, who had learned of the deal and had prepared a counter-spell based on selfless love. Unable to take Blaze's [[soul]], Mephisto has his revenge by binding Blaze with a demonic force.

Blaze then finds himself transforming into a demonic entity at nightfall, during which times he wields strange powers. He is called the Ghost Rider for his strange appearance. As time goes on, he is able to call on his demonic abilities whenever he wishes, not just at night. Eventually, he seems to have a different personality as Ghost Rider and it is finally revealed that Mephisto has forced Blaze to share his body with a demon rival named [[Zarathos]].

Originally, [[Zarathos]] was stripped of his memories and so Blaze was in control whenever they transformed into Ghost Rider. But now, Zarathos' true personality has resurfaced and from then on it is a continuing battle for dominance between him and Blaze. Being a demon, Zarathos craves the punishment of sinners and so Blaze at times willingly releases him when criminals or other threats are nearby. However, it is always a struggle to force Zarathos back so that Blaze can resume his control and his human identity. At time, Zarathos tries to find ways to destroy Blaze's soul so that he may be free to enjoy complete physical existence.

The character received his own series in 1973, with [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a long stint with #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through #58. [[Tony Isabella]] wrote a Ghost Rider story arc where Johnny Blaze became a [[Christian]] and thereby freed himself of the curse. Isabella said that ''"Johnny Blaze accepts Jesus Christ into his life. This gives him the strength to overcome Satan, though with more pyrotechnics than most of us can muster. He retains the Ghost Rider powers he had been given by Satan, but they are his to use as his new faith directs him."''  However, the story was apparently rewritten at the last moment.<ref>[http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/tony/back20011214.shtml]</ref>

Towards the end of the run, a villain named [[Centurious]] was introduced. Centurious was a man without a soul, making him immune to Ghost Rider's hellfire, and he had a history with Zarathos. This Ghost Rider's career ended when Zarathos fled Blaze's body in issue #81 (June 1983), the finale, in order to pursue Centurious. Now free of his curse, Blaze went off to live with Roxanne.
<!--[[Image:Ghost Rider 1.jpg|thumb|left|''Ghost Rider'' #1 (1973). Cover art by [[Gil Kane]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]--> 

In the next Ghost Rider series, it would be revealed that Roxanne and Johnny eventually got married and had two children.

==Daniel Ketch==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)}}
The next Ghost Rider debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, #1 (May 1990). '''Daniel Ketch''' and his sister Barbara are caught in a gang war involving [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s. They run and Barbara is hit. Daniel then notices a nearby motorcycle lying unattended, bearing a mystical [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] on its gas cap. Touching the symbol, he is transformed into the new Ghost Rider, who proclaims himself to be a "spirit of vengeance." Although this Ghost Rider defeats the gangsters, he is unable to save Barbara, who slips into a coma. She is eventually killed by the vampiric villain [[Blackout (comics)#Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]], a lieutenant of the very organization responsible for her state and whom Ketch acquires as a mortal enemy. Another major enemy was Blackout's boss [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]].

This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume and bike underwent a modernized tailoring, consisting of a black leather [[leather jacket|biker jacket]] with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain that he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic, [[high tech]] machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram on occasions. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. 
<!--[[Image:GhostRider_vol_2_issue_1.jpg|thumb|left|''Ghost Rider''vol. 2, #1. Cover art by [[Javier Saltares]].]]-->
Johnny Blaze seeks out the new Ghost Rider, believing at first that it is the same demon who had possessed him years before. Realizing this isn't the case, he becomes an ally to the new Ghost Rider and a friend/mentor to Danny Ketch, even teaching him how to fight. It is later revealed that Ketch and Blaze are long-lost brothers and that their family are the inheritors of a mystical curse related to the Spirits of Vengeance. Later still, they discover that the Ghost Rider spirit is apparently their ancestor, a man named Noble Kale who was cursed to live on through his descendants. Several of these secrets are revealed to them by a man called the Caretaker, who seems to be nearly immortal and is tasked with making sure the Ghost Rider follows his true path.

Unlike the Blaze/Zarathos relationship, Danny and the second Ghost Rider are more cooperative towards each other.  This Ghost Rider has a compassionate side and refuses to take over completely, as this would condemn Danny to a lifeless existence as a mere host body. Ketch and the Ghost Rider spirit, like Blaze and Zarathos, can sometimes communicate through dreams or will leave messages for each other (such as writing a note or using lipstick to scribble messages on a mirror).

When Ghost Rider becomes a part of the [[Midnight Sons]], he dies twice in the process. The first person to kill Ghost Rider is the vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], whose mind is possessed by the [[Darkhold]] at the time. Ghost Rider is soon revived by the Darkhold Redeemers, along with everyone else killed by Blade. The second time he dies is while fighting [[Zarathos]], but as before, he is once again reborn.

At the close of the series, Blaze seemed to lose his children to mystical forces and Roxanne was killed, only to be transformed into the demon Black Rose. Ghost Rider Issue #91 (Dec. 1997) revealed the second Ghost Rider to actually be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment. Daniel Ketch then apparently dies and Noble Kale becomes a ruler in Hell. Years later, [[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume One (1990-1998)|Peter Parker: Spider-Man]] #93 (July 1997) revealed that Ketch was still alive. The Ghost Rider spirit reappears and seems to bond with him again, telling him that it has learned that he is not, in fact, Noble Kale at all and that this was a lie meant to confuse them. When Danny Ketch shows up again in the new Ghost Rider series, he is completely human and not bonded to any spirit. What's more, he is told by the Caretaker that his transformation into the second Ghost Rider was a mistake. What happened to Danny over the past few years is to be explained in further issues of the new Ghost Rider series and in an upcoming mini-series starring him.

The series ended with a [[cliffhanger]] in vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998). Marvel finally published the long-completed final issue nine years later as ''Ghost Rider Finale'' (Jan. 2007), which reprints vol. 2, #93 and the previously unpublished #94. Note: While the cover reads ''Ghost Rider'' #94, the comic's postal indicia lists the official title as ''Ghost Rider Finale''. The finale revealed that Roxanne's true spirit was restored and that she left her existence as Black Rose behind and returned to Johnny's side, though she suffered from heavy memory loss.

==Johnny Blaze returns==
A six-issue [[limited series|mini-series]], again featuring Blaze as the Ghost Rider (though how this happened was not explained), debuted in 2001 under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.  Subtitled "The Hammer Lane," it was written by [[Devin K. Grayson]] and penciled by Trent Kaniuga. The miniseries was ill-regarded by fans. Some elements of the series, such as Roxanne's death, have also been overturned by the later released final issue of the Dan Ketch series.

A second six-issue mini-series, by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]], subtitled "Road to Damnation," debuted November 2005. This series also featured Blaze, who was now dead and in Hell, trapped in the form of the Ghost Rider. The series focused on his futile attempts at escaping from Hell. His powers here now included being able to breathe hellfire like a dragon and launching chains from his throat. Blaze's new Ghost Rider appearance is similar to Daniel Ketch's, a change that assistant editor Michael O'Connor attributes{{Fact|date=February 2008}} to the manifestation of Ghost Rider's powers themselves.

In July 2006, a new ongoing monthly series, titled simply ''Ghost Rider,'' began.  Written by [[Daniel Way]] with art by [[Mark Texeira]], it takes place after the Ennis miniseries. It features Blaze still in Hell, desperately trying to escape. At the end of the first issue, he is manipulated into returning to Earth, bringing Lucifer with him. The series then revolves around Blaze fighting Lucifer and his forces. Flashback issues also show Johnny Blaze finally dying and being condemned to Hell due to his original deal with the Devil. Roxanne's whereabouts are unknown.

In Way's last story arc, it is revealed<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol.6 #17</ref> that it was not due to Mephisto but rather because of an angel named [[Zadkiel]] that the original Ghost Rider was born, intended to be Heaven's weapon on Earth who would fight demons, and that this angelic purpose is why the Devil could not keep him in Hell. With issue #20, writer [[Jason Aaron]] and penciler [[Roland Boschi]] became the creative team, and reintroduced Danny Ketch, now a normal human who learns from the Caretaker that his initial transformation into the second Ghost Rider had been inadvertent.

==Powers and abilities== 
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a being with a flaming skull and supernatural powers. The motorcycles he rides can travel faster than conventional motorcycles and can perform such seemingly impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across the surface of water and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles could not match. The Ghost Riders are notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain. The Ghost Riders possess superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a motorcycle and hurl it across a room. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 5 tons (or more as seen in World War Hulk).<ref>''All-New Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe A-Z HC'' #4"</ref>

Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him.

*'''Johnny Blaze''' - Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a darker, more sinister appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. Hellfire "burns the soul" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the "Penance Stare."<br /><br />In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During "World War Hulk" it was stated by Dr. Stephen Strange that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the "Green Scar" persona of Hulk and could defeat him, but wouldn't because Ghost Rider only defended the innocent and the Illuminati wasn't innocent. Ghost Rider also has the "Penance Stare" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. He also now has new abilities including hellfire breath and the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest.  He is also now able to travel between the incorporeal realms.

*'''Daniel Ketch''' - When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains, gray leather pants and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional into a high-tech motorcycle (This transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he found in the cemetery as he was once seen to be able to transform another cycle in "Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness"). Along with flaming wheels that allows the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front.<br /><br />As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the ''Penance Stare.'' By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. This ability was seen to have little effect on some people who were mentally unstable (such as the being known as [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]. Ghost Rider was also knocked out when attempting to use the Penance Stare on [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]).<br /><br />Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when "innocent blood was spilled" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap, but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by will.

==Origins==

Thomas, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, described the character's genesis:
{{cquote|I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' — a very lackluster character — called Stunt-Master... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when Gary Friedrich started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, "Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider." He didn't describe him. I said, "Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it," and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from [[Missouri]], and I said, "That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book." When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, Mike Ploog, who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''1968 Special'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it.<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html ''Comic Book Artist'' (May 2001): "Roy Thomas Interview: Son of Stan's Years of Horror"]</ref>}}

Friedrich on the above, in 2001:
{{cquote|Well, there's some disagreement between Roy, Mike, and I over that. I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it, I'm gonna sue them, and I probably will. ...It was my idea. It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it, it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle. Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea. But, to tell you the truth, it was ''my'' idea.<ref>Gary Friedrich interview, ''Comic Book Artist'' (May 2001), p. 84</ref>}}

On April 4, 2007, Friedrich sued [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Enterprises]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures]], Relativity Media, Crystal Sky Pictures, [[Michael DeLuca]] Productions, [[Hasbro]], and [[Take-Two Interactive]], alleging his [[copyright]]s to the Ghost Rider character have been exploited and used in a "joint venture and conspiracy". The [[lawsuit]] states that the film rights and [[merchandising]] reverted from Marvel to him in 2001.<ref>[http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=19535 ''Animation World News'' (April 11, 2007): "Ghost Rider Creator Sues Marvel, Sony & More"]</ref>

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==
===Vengeance===
{{main|Vengeance (comics)}}

'''Michael Badilino''', an ex-member of the [[New York City Police Department]], is one third of an "Organic Medallion of Power"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.

===Ghost Rider 2099===
{{main|Ghost Rider 2099}}
[[Image:Ghost Rider 2099 2 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Ghost Rider 2099]]'''Zero Cochrane''', who in the [[Marvel 2099]] alternate timeline is a cybernetic take on the Spirit of Vengeance, is not a supernatural being, but a cybernetic being with a digitized copy of Cochrane's mind. He encounters a futuristic counterpoint to Michael Badilino's Vengeance. The Ghost Rider of 2099 appears to drop out of existence during the consolidation of the 2099 books into a single title called ''2099 World of Tomorrow.'' He subsequently appears in the 2099 "epilogue" book ''Manifest Destiny'', arguing with the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] that empowers him.

=== Marvel Zombies ===

In the ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' story-arc "Crossover" depicts an alternate Earth inhabited by zombiefied superheroes and villains, with a Ghost Rider among them. He is also seen in [[Marvel Zombies]] in one panel joining the infected heroes attacking the [[Silver Surfer]].

He then reappers in [[Marvel Zombies 3]] #3 attacking [[Machine Man]]. However he is quickly disposed off when he his head is cut off. Machine Man then steals his bike and rides off.

===The Spirit of Vengeance===
{{main|Spirit of Vengeance}}
This version of Ghost Rider known as the [[Spirit of Vengeance]] debuted in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (Original)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', set in an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. He has the ability to traverse space and fire spike projectiles from his forearms. This Ghost Rider is a religious zealot, embittered toward a church (a version of the [[Universal Church of Truth]]) proclaiming it would produce its god in the flesh. That being, the [[Protégé (comics)|Protege]], is destroyed by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] [[List of Celestials members#Scathan the Approver|Scathan the Approver]]. This Ghost Rider refers to himself simply as the Spirit of Vengeance, although his real name is given as Autocylus, from the planet Sarka. After answering a distress call from [[Firelord#Guardians of the Galaxy|Firelord]]<ref>Guardians of the Galaxy #12</ref>, the Guardians of the Galaxy help a planet in peril, this Ghost Rider eventually helps to destroy the threat. The Spirit of Vengeance joins several other powerful beings including [[Martinex]], [[Wonder Man#Guardians of the Galaxy|Hollywood]], [[Replica (comics)|Replica]], [[Firelord#Guardians of the Galaxy|Firelord]], [[Phoenix IX]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Mainframe|Mainframe]].<ref>Guardians of the Galaxy Annual #2</ref> The heroes, rallied by Martinex, stay together as the new Galactic Guardians<ref>''Galactic Guardians'' #1-4</ref>.<ref>http://www.marvel.com/universe/Spirit_of_Vengeance_%28Earth-691%29</ref>

===''Trail of Tears''===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the [[limited series|miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears'' #1-6 (April-Sept. 2007) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]]. Set during the [[American Civil War]], it finds Confederate officer '''Travis Parham''' avenging the murders of his  friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

===The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance===
Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat.  Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission:  To collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts.  Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, of which he needs the powers of the riders for:  To tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.  

The story begins in Tibet with Chinese soldiers harassing a village, questioning them about weapons that killed two of his garrison patrols.  During the harassment a monk enters on a donkey.  After a few exchange of words and an order to kill given by the Gengeral, the monk changes and kills the General's men while his back is turned.  When the General turns back he sees the Ghost Rider and gets a penance stare for his trouble.  After the attack the rider goes back to his sanctuary where he is visited by Danny Ketch.  A short while later Sister Sara and Johnny Blaze arrive at the sanctuary to find out how to get back at Zadkiel.  After entering, they find the monk and donkey burnt to husks.

That night the two are visited by Ketch and begins a battle with a show of power.  When Blaze does the penance stare to his brother, he sees exactly what has transpired.  Ketch has murdered the hosts of numerous riders for their powers.  During a show of pity for the fallen, Ketch is able to return the stare on Blaze, and sends Blaze into temporary insanity.  Before Ketch is able to take the power of Zarathos, he is stopped by the new caretaker Sister Sara.  She rescues Blaze and they go to a safehouse.  At the safehouse, during Blaze's self pity and Sara's trying to pick him back up, they are visited by two more Ghost Riders, the Arabic Molek and the Chinese Bai Gu Jing, with whom they follow to Japan.

When Blaze's team arrives in Japan, they learn Ketch has already taken the power of the rider Yoshio Kannabe.  After the conquest, Ketch has another talk with Zadkiel via communications link.  During the conversation Zadkiel massacres the squad of the Asura who guard the gates of heaven.  Zadkiel tells Ketch to wait to attack the riders til the last ones are together.  Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, former cop Kowalski follows a contact to get a hellfire shotgun for his revenge on Blaze.  After acquiring the item he is then driven to the middle of a desert to sit and wait for his chance.

After leaving Japan, Blaze's team journeys to the City of the Skulls in the Congo where the last stand would be made.  There they meet the Lords of the Congo, the Ghost Riders Baron Skullfire and Marinette Bwachech, and their Phantom Riders.  During the day Sara tells Molek about her new experience becoming a Caretaker, and her wonders about religion, with which she is given secret information that Molek knows about both.

As the Ghost Riders and their forces get ready for battle, Blaze has his eyes opened back up by kids going to fight.  He quickly snaps out of his depression and joins the others for the final battle.  During the course of the battle Baron Skullfire dies and the spirit is transferred to one of the Phantom Riders, after which Ketch creates hellfire duplicates of himself to take the powers.  A wager is then made by Blaze and Ketch on a race between the brothers around the world for the fates of the powers.  During the race, Blaze is critically injured by Kowalski's shotgun and Ketch takes the rider from him as his duplicates overpower the others.

Moments later Ketch returns the heaven and Zadkiel is then able to take heaven.  The sound of the gates falling is enough to be felt by Spider-man's senses, and loud enough to be heard by people and everywhere including Hell and Asgard.  When an injured Blaze returns to the City of the Skulls, Ketch falls from the sky and reveals that the battle for Heaven has already been decided.  As more energies fall from the heavens, one strikes Kowalski and changes him into a new rider that looks a lot like Vengeance.
