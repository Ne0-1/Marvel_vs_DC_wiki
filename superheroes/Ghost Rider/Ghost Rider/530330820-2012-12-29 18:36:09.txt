'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supernatural]] [[antihero]]es appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western comics|Western]] character whose name was later changed to '''Night Rider''' and subsequently to '''[[Phantom Rider]]'''.

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]''', who, in order to save the life of his mentor, agreed to give his soul to "[[Satan]]" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). Instead, his soul bonded with the entity called [[Zarathos]]. When utilizing Zarathos' powers, Blaze's flesh is consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields trademark blasts of hellfire from his skeletal hands. He starred in the series from 1972–1983. Ghost Rider was co-created by Gary Friedrich.

The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990–1998) featured '''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle which had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a "Spirit of Vengeance".

Johnny Blaze reappeared in this 1990s series as a [[supporting character]]. In mid-2000s comics, Blaze again became the Ghost Rider, succeeding Ketch. 

[[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Matt Long]] played Johnny Blaze in the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]''. Cage reprised the role in the sequel ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'' in 2012.

In May 2011, Ghost Rider placed 90th on [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time<ref name="IGN" />.

==Johnny Blaze==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)}}
After the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, the next known Ghost Rider appears in the Marvel comic book ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (Aug. 1972), where the story and characters are credited as being created by [[Gary Friedrich]], aided and abetted by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Roy Thomas]], with  [[artist]] [[Mike Ploog]].

Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt performer in a traveling circus, sold his soul to one whom he believes to be [[Satan]] but actually is the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (a [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]), in order to save his stepfather, "Crash" Simpson, from cancer. Crash later dies in a motorcycle accident and Mephisto attempts to take Blaze's soul, only to be thwarted by Crash's daughter Roxanne, who had learned of the deal and had prepared a counter-spell based on selfless love. Since Roxanne interrupted in the middle of the pact, Mephisto could only bind half the [[soul]] of a demon with Blaze, making him transform only at night when around evil.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 (Aug. 1972)</ref>

Blaze then finds himself transforming into a demonic entity at nightfall, during which times he wields strange powers. He is called the Ghost Rider for his strange appearance. As time goes on, he is able to call on his demonic abilities whenever he wishes, not just at night. Eventually, he seems to have a different personality as Ghost Rider and it is finally revealed that Mephisto has forced Blaze to share his body with a demon rival named [[Zarathos]].

Originally, [[Zarathos]] was stripped of his memories and so Blaze was in control whenever they transformed into Ghost Rider. But now, Zarathos' true personality has resurfaced and from then on it is a continuing battle for dominance between him and Blaze. Being a demon, Zarathos craves the punishment of sinners and so Blaze at times willingly releases him when criminals or other threats are nearby. However, it is always a struggle to force Zarathos back so that Blaze can resume his control and his human identity. At times, Zarathos tries to find ways to destroy Blaze's soul so that he may be free to enjoy complete physical existence.

The character received his own series in 1973, with  Friedrich penning the first several issues, until writing was taken over by [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a long stint with #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through #58. [[Tony Isabella]] wrote a Ghost Rider story arc where Johnny Blaze became a [[Christian]] and thereby freed himself of the curse. Isabella said that ''"Johnny Blaze accepts Jesus Christ into his life. This gives him the strength to overcome Satan, though with more pyrotechnics than most of us can muster. He retains the Ghost Rider powers he had been given by Satan, but they are his to use as his new faith directs him."''  However, the story was apparently rewritten at the last moment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/tony/back20011214.shtml |title=Tony's Online Tips - Tony Isabella, Dec 14, 2001 |work=World Famous Comics |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref>

Towards the end of the run, a villain named [[Centurious]] was introduced. Centurious was a man without a soul, making him immune to Ghost Rider's hellfire, and he had a history with Zarathos. Thus Ghost Rider's career ended when Zarathos fled Blaze's body in issue #81 (June 1983), the finale, in order to pursue Centurious. Now free of his curse, Blaze went off to live with Roxanne.
<!--[[Image:Ghost Rider 1.jpg|thumb|left|''Ghost Rider'' #1 (1973). Cover art by [[Gil Kane]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]-->

In the next ''Ghost Rider'' series, it would be revealed that Roxanne and Johnny eventually got married and had two children.

==Daniel Ketch==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)}}
The next Ghost Rider, was a young man named '''Daniel Ketch''', debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2 #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather [[leather jacket|biker jacket]] with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain that he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, and the demonic Zarathos who possessed him, Ketch and his demon — eventually revealed in #91 (Dec. 1997) to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment — are cooperative with each other. As with Blaze and Zarathos, they can sometimes communicate through dreams or will leave messages for each other, such as writing a note or using lipstick to scribble messages on a mirror.

At the close of the series with vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998), Blaze seemed to lose his children to mystical forces and Roxanne was killed, only to be transformed into the demon Black Rose; Daniel Ketch also apparently died and Noble Kale became a ruler in Hell. The following year, ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume One (1990-1998)|Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as ''Ghost Rider Finale'' (Jan. 2007), which reprints vol. 2, #93 and the previously unpublished #94. Note: While the [[trademarked]] cover logo reads ''Ghost Rider'' #94, the comic's postal [[indicia (publishing)|indicia]] lists the comic [[copyrighted]] as ''Ghost Rider Finale''. The finale revealed that Roxanne's true spirit was restored and that she left her existence as Black Rose behind and returned to Blaze's side, though she suffered from heavy memory loss.

==Alejandra==
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, a Nicaraguan woman named Alejandra ends up becoming a Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam at the time when [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] (in the form of Skadi) attacks [[Dayton, Ohio]] alongside [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]] and the half-demon version of [[Blackout (comics)|Blackout]]. This Ghost Rider dispatches Deathwatch and Blackout before engaging Skadi. But when she touches Skadi's hammer, she is incapacitated and reverted to human form because according to Skadi, touching the hammer was akin to touching fear itself. Later she shows how many unknown powers the Ghost Rider has.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 7, #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal being with a flaming skull and supernatural powers. The motorcycles he rides can travel faster than conventional motorcycles and can perform such seemingly impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across the surface of water and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles could not match. The Ghost Riders are notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are seen to melt while in their body).<ref>''[[Ghost Rider (film)]]''</ref> It is possible that they are genuinely immortal; it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them.<ref>''Ghost Riders: Heavens On Fire'' #6</ref> The Ghost Riders possess superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons (or more as seen in [[World War Hulk]]).<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #4</ref> But a Ghost Rider's powers are more of a curse until they learn to control it.

Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him.

* '''Johnny Blaze''' – Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a darker, more sinister appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. Hellfire "burns the soul" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the "Penance Stare." In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During "World War Hulk" it was stated by Dr. Stephen Strange that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the "[[Green Scar]]" persona of [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and could possibly defeat him. However, Ghost Rider is defeated and Johnny Blaze knocked out. Zarathos himself then emerges and rides off because (as Dr. Strange stated) Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics Blaze's Ghost Rider has been given the "Penance Stare" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. He also now has new abilities including hellfire breath and the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest. He is also now able to travel between the incorporeal realms.

* '''Daniel Ketch''' – When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains, gray leather pants and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional into a high-tech motorcycle (This transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he found in the cemetery as he was once seen to be able to transform another cycle in "Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness"). Along with flaming wheels that allows the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the ''Penance Stare.'' By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. This ability was seen to have little effect on some people who were mentally unstable (such as the being known as [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]. Ghost Rider was also knocked out when attempting to use the Penance Stare on [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]). Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when "innocent blood was spilled" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap, but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone.

==Origins==
Thomas, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, described the character's genesis:
{{bquote|I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' — a very lackluster character — called Stunt-Master... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when Gary Friedrich started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, "Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider." He didn't describe him. I said, "Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it," and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from [[Missouri]], and I said, "That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book." When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, Mike Ploog, who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''1968 Special'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it.<ref name="Roy Thomas interview">[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html Roy Thomas interview], ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #13, May 2001. [http://www.webcitation.org/5vHVThU3A WebCitation archive].</ref>}}

Friedrich on the above, in 2001:
{{bquote|Well, there's some disagreement between Roy, Mike, and I over that. I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it, I'm gonna sue them, and I probably will. ...It was my idea. It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it, it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle. Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea. But, to tell you the truth, it was ''my'' idea.<ref name="Comic Book Artist 2001, p. 84">Gary Friedrich interview, ''Comic Book Artist'', May 2001, p. 84</ref>}}

Ploog recalled, in a 2008 interview:
{{blockquote|Now, there's been all kinds of dialog about who was the creator of Ghost Rider. Gary Friedrich was the writer on it. ... The flaming skull: That was the big area of dispute. Who thought of the flaming skull? To be honest with you I can't remember. What else were you going to do with him? You couldn't put a helmet on him, so it had to be a flaming skull. As far as his costume went, it was part of the [[Phantom Rider|old [Western] Ghost Rider]]'s costume, with the Western panel front. The stripes down the arms and the legs were there merely so I could make the character['s costume] as black as I possibly could and sill keep track of his body. It was the easiest way to design him.<ref>Mike Ploog interview, in ''Modern Masters Volume Nineteen: Mike Ploog'' ([[TwoMorrows Publishing]], 2008), pp. 24–25. ISBN 978-1-60549-007-6</ref>}}

On April 4, 2007, Friedrich sued [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Enterprises]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures]], Relativity Media, Crystal Sky Pictures, [[Michael DeLuca]] Productions, [[Hasbro]], and [[Take-Two Interactive]], alleging his [[copyright]]s to the Ghost Rider character have been exploited and used in a "joint venture and conspiracy". The [[lawsuit]] states that the film rights and [[merchandising]] reverted from Marvel to him in 2001.<ref name="news.awn.com">{{cite web |author=Animation World Network |url=http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=19535 |title=''Animation World News'' (April 11, 2007): "Ghost Rider Creator Sues Marvel, Sony & More" |work=News.awn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref>

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==

===Vengeance===
{{main|Vengeance (comics)}}

'''Michael Badilino''', an ex-member of the [[New York City Police Department]], is one third of an "Organic Medallion of Power"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.

===The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance===
Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat.  Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, of which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.

The story begins in Tibet with Chinese soldiers harassing a village, questioning them about weapons that killed two of their garrison patrols. During the harassment a monk enters on a donkey. After a few exchange of words and an order to kill given by the general, the monk changes and kills the general's men while his back is turned. When the general turns back, he sees the Ghost Rider and gets a penance stare for his trouble. After the attack the Rider goes back to his sanctuary where he is visited by Danny Ketch. A short while later, Sister Sara and Johnny Blaze arrive at the sanctuary to find out how to get back at Zadkiel. After entering, they find the monk and donkey burnt to husks.

That night the two are visited by Ketch and begin a battle with a show of power. When Blaze does the penance stare to his brother, he sees exactly what has transpired. Ketch has murdered the hosts of numerous riders for their powers. During a show of pity for the fallen, Ketch is able to return the stare on Blaze and sends Blaze into temporary insanity. Before Ketch is able to take the power of Zarathos, he is stopped by the new caretaker, Sister Sara. She rescues Blaze and they go to a safehouse. At the safehouse, during Blaze's self-pity and Sara's trying to pick him back up, they are visited by two more Ghost Riders, the Arabic Molek and the Chinese Bai Gu Jing, with whom they follow to Japan.

When Blaze's team arrives in Japan, they learn Ketch has already taken the power of the rider Yoshio Kannabe. After the conquest, Ketch has another talk with Zadkiel via communications link. During the conversation, Zadkiel massacres the squad of the Asura who guard the gates of heaven. Zadkiel tells Ketch to wait to attack the riders until the last ones are together. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, former cop Kowalski follows a contact to get a hellfire shotgun for his revenge on Blaze. After acquiring the item, he is then driven to the middle of a desert to sit and wait for his chance.

After leaving Japan, Blaze's team journeys to the City of the Skulls in the Congo where the last stand would be made. There they meet the Lords of the Congo, the Ghost Riders Baron Skullfire and Marinette Bwachech, and their Phantom Riders. During the day, Sara tells Molek about her new experience becoming a Caretaker and her wonders about religion, with which she is given secret information that Molek knows about both.

As the Ghost Riders and their forces get ready for battle, Blaze has his eyes opened back up by kids going to fight. He quickly snaps out of his depression and joins the others for the final battle. During the course of the battle, Baron Skullfire dies and the spirit is transferred to one of the Phantom Riders, after which Ketch creates hellfire duplicates of himself to take the powers. A wager is then made by Blaze and Ketch on a race between the brothers around the world for the fates of the powers. During the race, Blaze is critically injured by Kowalski's shotgun and Ketch takes the rider from him as his duplicates overpower the others.

Moments later, Ketch returns to Heaven and Zadkiel is then able to take Heaven. The sound of the gates falling is enough to be felt by Spider-Man's senses, and loud enough to be heard by people and everywhere, including Hell and Asgard. When an injured Blaze returns to the City of the Skulls, Ketch falls from the sky and reveals that the battle for Heaven has already been decided. As more energies fall from the heavens, one strikes Kowalski and changes him into a new rider that looks a lot like Vengeance.

===''Trail of Tears''===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the [[limited series|miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears'' #1–6 (April–Sept. 2007) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]]. Set during the [[American Civil War]], it finds Confederate officer '''Travis Parham''' avenging the murders of his friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Ghost Rider made his debut in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' volume 2, #2.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22449 CCC09: Ultimate Marvel Panel Report], [[Comic Book Resources]], August 7, 2009</ref> Ultimate Ghost Rider's origin is explained in "[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]" volume 2, #4. Young twenty-something couple [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and [[Roxanne Simpson]] decided on a cross-country trip across the United States. One day they came across a bar where they befriended a biker gang, who kept buying them beer. The friendship was a ruse as they killed an intoxicated Blaze as part of a Satanic ritual. During the ritual, they bartered their souls with Satan in exchange for wealth and power. Satan granted their request but kept the upper hand. The deceased Blaze also made a deal that [[Mephisto (comics)|Satan]] will get his soul in exchange for the assured safety of Roxanne. For twenty years Blaze trained to become the Ghost Rider, burning away his Christian baptism and searing away anything that was soft on the inside, and was sent into the world to get his revenge. He tracked down and killed the members of the motorcycle gang—now rich and in positions of power—individually. Due to these deaths, an executive order comes down from the White House: kill the Ghost Rider. The Avengers are recruited into the mission with no knowledge of the Ghost Rider except that he is 7' tall and has the strength of Thor.<ref>[[Millar, Mark]]. ''Ultimate Comics Avengers 2'' #3 (Aug. 2010)</ref> When the Avengers were unsuccessful in stopping the Ghost Rider from killing his next target, the truth behind the Ghost Rider is learned, and the leader of the motorcycle gang is now the Vice-President of the United States, [[Vengeance (comics)|Michael Blackthorne]].

Johnny drags the Vice-President into a church which turns them both back into human form, allowing the [[Punisher]] to finish off the Vice-President. Pleading his case, Johnny is allowed to leave. He is later seen in a park with Satan watching Roxanne, who was brought back to life with no memory of what was done.

He encounters a futuristic counterpoint to Michael Badilino's Vengeance. The Ghost Rider of 2099 appears to drop out of existence during the consolidation of the 2099 books into a single title called ''2099 World of Tomorrow.''

===Movies===
There have been two [[film]] adaptations:
* [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]]/[[Columbia Pictures]] released a ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'' film starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as Johnny Blaze on February 16, 2007. The character faces [[Blackheart]] and his father, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]]. Unlike in the comics where Roxanne's spell was responsible for Blaze's control of the Ghost Rider, here it is implied that Blaze retains control of his curse because he sold his soul for another rather than for himself.
* Nicolas Cage reprised his role in a sequel to the 2007 film entitled ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''. In the film, the character was recruited by a sect to save Danny from being possessed by the demon Roarke.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://heatvision.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/09/ghost-rider-2-ciaran-hinds-.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter |title='Ghost Rider 2' goes to Hell to find its villain |publisher=HeatVision |date=September&nbsp;30, 2010 |accessdate=October&nbsp;01, 2010}}</ref> The film was released on February 17, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/107349-ghost-rider-spirit-of-vengeance-set-for-february-17-2012 |title=''Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance'' Set for February 17, 2012 |work=superherohype.com |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |date=September&nbsp;17, 2010 |accessdate=September&nbsp;30, 2010}}</ref>
