'''''Ghost Rider''''' is the name of several [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]], and of several characters in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Western Ghost Rider==
The original Ghost Rider was a masked [[gunfighter]] in the American [[Old West]] who debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' (first series) #1 (Feb. 1967).  He battled evil while dressed in a luminescent white costume, complete with a mask and the requisite white hat.  After the appearance of subsequent Ghost Riders, this character's name was changed first to the unfortunate [[Night Rider]] (a name that also refers to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]) in a 1974-1975 reprint series, and then to [[Phantom Rider]].  At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

==Johnny Blaze==

The second Ghost Rider first appeared in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' Vol. 1, #5 (Aug. 1972). John Blaze, a motorcycle stunt performer in a traveling circus, sold his soul to the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to save his best friend, Crash Simpson's life.  He was bound with the demon [[Zarathos]], and transformed into a leather-clad skeleton, and his head was cloaked in a sheath of flame.  This Ghost Rider's career ended when Zarathos fled Blaze's body in ''Ghost Rider'' (1973 series) #81 (June 1983). 

Johnny Blaze would mistake '''Noble Kale''' (an earlier Ghost Rider, the first known to have utilized the name in links with the supernatural) for Zarathos during a second Ghost Rider series (1990-1998), and after attempting to destroy him, eventually became an ally. Johnny, like his long-lost brother '''Danny Ketch''' (see below), are direct descendants of Kale. Johnny was supposed to have become Kale's next host, but due to the actions of their mother, the siblings Johnny, Barbara, and Daniel (apparently their true last name is either Kale or Blaze, though no information has confirmed which is correct) were supposed to have been passed over by the curse of being Noble's host. Johnny was "spared" having to be Noble's host, but became the host for another [[entity]] (Zarathos, who had been stripped of his memories and was originally under Johnny's control. As the series progressed, that control faded and Zarathos' true personality was evident whenever Ghost Rider was unleashed).

[[Roy Thomas]], Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, described the character's genesis:  "I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil]]'' — a very lackluster character — called Stunt-Master ... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when [[Gary Friedrich]] started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, "Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider." He didn't describe him. I said, "Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it," and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from Missouri, and I said, "That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book." When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, [[Mike Ploog]], who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''1968 Special'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it in back office for three hours." [http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html]:

==Daniel Ketch==
The third debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' (1990 series) #1 (May 1990). '''Daniel Ketch''' and his sister Barbara, attacked by [[ninja]] [[gangsters]], fled and hid in a garbage dump where Daniel found a motorcycle bearing a mystical sigil. Upon touching the sigil, he was transformed into the Ghost Rider.  This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, though his costume and bike had undergone a modernized tailoring.  He thrashed the gangsters, but was unable to save Barbara, who died.

It was later revealed that Daniel Ketch and John Blaze were long-lost brothers and that their family were the inheritors of a mystical curse related to the [[Spirits of Vengeance]].  Ketch eventually died, but the Spirit of Vengeance that had been bound to him through the bike's talisman lived on.  Still later, Blaze became the Ghost Rider again through occult action, reappearing in the six-issue [[Marvel Knights]] [[miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider'' (Aug. 2001 - Jan. 2002; story arc titled "The Hammer Lane").

==Continuity Conundrums==
[[Image:GhostriderMarvellegends.jpg|75px|thumb|Ghost Rider from Marvel Legends]]
The Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider fusion has not clarified whether or not this version of the Spirit of Vengeance is Noble Kale. Several continuity problems point to this being an entirely new Ghost Rider.

Noble Kale, in the final issue of the 1990s ''Ghost Rider'' series, killed [[Blackheart]] and apparently claimed the throne of one of Marvel's many realms of Hell. However, with the return of [[Mephisto]], who was responsible in part for Kale becoming the Ghost Rider, Kale may have been deposed from that realm. Since Kale and Danny Ketch merged again in a [[Spider-Man]] comic directly before the release of the 2001 miniseries, there is no clear answer as to where Kale actually is or to whom, if anyone, he is bonded.  Additionally, in the 2001 miniseries, the Ghost Rider killed humans, an action Kale specifically refused to commit.

==2005 series==
[[Image:ghostrider2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Promotional art for Marvel Knights ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Nov. 2005), by Clayton Crain]]
A second six-issue miniseries featuring Johnny Blaze, this one by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]], debuted November 2005. This new series ''seems'' to take up where the 2001-02 Ghost Rider miniseries leaves off. However, it regards Johnny's deal with Satan (later [[retconned]] to Mephisto), as having occured 30 years previous, a rare act of time alteration by Marvel, though this does mean it is somewhat in keeping with Johnny looking older and more grizzled in the second volume of Ghost Rider, featuring Ketch. Yet the 2005 miniseries makes no references to Zarathos in the first or second issue. Moreover, Blaze's appearance seems much more in tune with the "Hammer Lane" version of the Rider crossed with the Noble Kale version. Like in his earliest appearances, Johnny Blaze's mind is in complete control over the Ghost Rider body, so this is unlikely to be Zarathos or Kale. It also doesn't appear to be whatever version of the Ghost Rider he was playing host to in "Hammer Lane", so this miniseries may take place in an [[parallel universe|alternate Earth]] separate from the prime [[Marvel Universe]].

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==
There have been three other notable Spirits of Vengeance in the Marvel unvierse:

===Vengeance===

'''Michael Badilino''', a former member of the NYPD, is one third of an "Organic Medallion of Power". He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, though he did possess the Penance Stare and his motorcyle also seemed to share characteristics with the version used by Noble Kale. He was characterised by his skull being deep purple, by fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and large spike protrusions with a backswept curve on the top of his skull. 

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by the name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire (the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider). 

Vengeance would reappear in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aided the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, and Blackheart was destroyed.

===Ghost Rider 2099===

'''Zero Cochrane''', who in the [[Marvel 2099]] alternate timeline is a cybernetic take on the Spirit of Vengeance, was not a supernatural being, but a cybernetic being with a digitized copy of Cochrane's mind. He encountered a futuristic counterpoint to Michael Badilino's Vengeance. The Ghost Rider of 2099 appeared to drop out of existence during the consolidation of the 2099 books into a single title called ''2099 World of Tomorrow.''

===The Spirit of Vengeance===

This version debuted in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', set in an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. He joined a variant group calling themselves the Galactic Guardians. This Ghost Rider was a religious zealot, embittered toward a church proclaiming it would produce its god in the flesh for reasons never completely explained. That being, the Protege, was destroyed by the [[Celestial]] Scathan the Approver. Whether or not this Ghost Rider, who referred to himself simply as the Spirit of Vengeance, overcame his bitterness at the Protege after hearing of his destruction, is unkown. However, as the Galactic Guardians mini-series takes place after the apparent destruction of the Protege, and there is no knowledge of whether or not the Spirit knows of Protege's demise, we may never know, as even the Guardians of the Galaxy is now out of print, though the some of the main characters of that series, have appeared in [[Paradise X]].

==Other Media==
[[Image:GhostRiderTeaser.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A teaser poster for the [[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider Movie]].<br>Posted at [[Comic-Con]] 2005.]]

Ghost Rider has appeared in the ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series on the [[UPN|UPN Network]] and the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' episode called, "When Calls Galactus."  [[Richard Grieco]] provided Ghost Rider's voice on both occasions.  The Ghost Rider also appeared extremely breifly as a memory in Gambit's mind during the old X-Men cartoon which aired on Fox, though he did not speak on that occasion.

A [[Ghost_Rider (Movie)|Ghost Rider movie]] starring [[Nicolas Cage]] is slated for release in [[2007 in film|2007]] (originally it was said the film would be released in 2006, but apparently this has since changed.). The character will face [[Blackheart]] and his father, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].

There is also a song called "Ghost Rider" written by the New York punk/electronic band Suicide (made up of Alan Vega and Martin Rev) from their self-titled 1977 album.  While it may or may not necessarily be directly inspired by the comic book character, many of the lyrics could easily be interpreted as such, including "Riding through your town with his head on fire" and repeated used of the words "motorcycle hero."  The song has also been covered multiple times by bands such as the [[Rollins Band]].

[[Method Man]] of the worldfamous rap group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] often refers to himself as Johnny Blaze as his hip-hop alter-ego, much like his fellow Clansman [[Ghostface Killah]] is aka Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]). Note Wu-tang Video Triumph Mef (Method Man) riding on a bike with flames as he raps.

Ghost Rider's flaming skull is said to have served as the inspiration for [[Mortal Kombat]]'s [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat character) |Scorpion]] as Scorpion's alternative costume in both the games and various media is a flaming skull.
