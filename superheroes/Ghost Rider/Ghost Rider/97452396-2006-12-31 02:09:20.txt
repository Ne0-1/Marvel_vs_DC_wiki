'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]], [[supernatural]] [[anti-hero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western fiction|Western]] character whose name was later changed to Night Rider and subsequently to [[Phantom Rider]].

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''Johnny Blaze''', who, in order to save the life of his mentor, agreed to give his soul to Satan (later revealed to be [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). Instead his soul was bonded with the entity called [[Zarathos]]. When emitting Zarathos’ powers, Blaze's head became a flaming skull and he wielded a  fiery motorcycle and trademark blasts of hellfire from his skeletal hands. He starred in an eponymous series from 1973-1983.

The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990-98) featured '''Daniel Ketch''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[gang]]sters, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle which had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a "Spirit of Vengeance."  This spirit had originally been a [[Puritan]] man named [[Noble Kale]], an ancestor of both Blaze and Ketch. Johnny Blaze reappeared in this series as a [[supporting character]] and was revealed to be Ketch’s brother.

Following the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] to originally use the name, this Ghost Rider [[first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' vol. 1, #5 (Aug. 1972), created by [[writers]] [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gary Friedrich]] and [[artist]] [[Mike Ploog]].

[[Image:Ghost Rider 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Sept., 1973). Art by [[Gil Kane]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
The original Ghost Rider, a man named Noble Kale, was transformed into the Spirit of Vengeance - the Ghost Rider of the 18th century. Mephisto, who was granting aid to Kale's father, the local town pastor, to keep the town prosperous, under the pretext that they were being shown favor from God, had had his eye on [[Noble Kale]], a genuinely good and pure hearted man. The truth was discovered by Magdelena, Noble's wife. As she was being burned at the stake, she called down vengeful creatures called the Furies (who may or may not be the Furies of Greek mythology) to take vengeance on Pastor Kale. Unfortunately, they wanted to then eradicate all traces of the Kale bloodline. Their first victim was not Pastor Kale, but rather his youngest son Dante. Turning again to Mephisto for aid, The Ghost Rider was created from Pastor Kale's eldest son, Noble, intially to be a demon new to the services of Mephisto's particular realm of Hell. Rather than take human life, the now altered Noble Kale ran himself through, when he was offered up his ''own'' son for his first meal. Mephisto attempted to claim Kale's soul, only to be stopped by the angel Uriel. The two reached an accord, and recreated Kale as the new Spirit of Vengeance known as the Ghost Rider. Mephisto, though unable to directly harm any of the bloodline of the Rider, was able to lay a curse on them, making Kale only able to exist in the real world by possessing the bodies of his descendants.  Mephisto kept an eye on Noble and the Kale clan from then on watching as Kale manifested in the firstborn of every generation of the Kales. Sometime during the next hundred years or so, a group called The Blood got involved with the newly created Spirit of Vengeance, and shattered a medallion which bore the brand of Vengeance, and implanted it into descendants of the Blaze bloodline.

Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcyclist/daredevil, was the son of Barton Blaze and Naomi Kale.  Johnny spent his early years in the Quentin Carnival where his parents starred in a stunt show with Craig “Crash” Simpson.  Johnny’s family had ended when his mother Naomi, scared that Johnny would suffer the same way she had, abandoned Barton and Johnny and took her other two children whom she placed in the care of a woman named Francis Ketch.

Losing his mother caused Johnny to repress many of his memories of Naomi and his siblings. When Barton died in a stunt not long after, Johnny was adopted by Crash and Mona Simpson.  The Simpsons helped Johnny by fabricating his past with the hope that it would be less painful than the truth.  Now believing that his real mother was Clara Blaze, who had passed away, Johnny became an enthusiastic member of the Simpson Clan, growing closer to their daughter, Roxanne. The two soon became inseparable and, as they grew older their fondness for one another moved beyond familial.

As years passed, Naomi Kale returned to spy on Johnny.  Naomi was glad to see him growing into a happy young man, but she still feared the curse Johnny had in him.  Naomi made a deal with Mephisto to spare him from becoming the Ghost Rider, Noble Kale. Unfortunately, Mephisto betrayed Naomi on her death bed: Johnny would indeed not become the next host for Noble Kale, 'the' Ghost Rider, but instead become the host for 'a' Ghost Rider.

Unaware of what was happening behind his back, Johnny followed the Simpsons into their own traveling stunt show – the Crash Simpson Stunt Cycle Extravaganza. Crash had become a real father figure in Johnny’s eyes, and when Johnny learned of Crash's life-threatening cancer, Johnny turned to the Occult, in search of answers. His studies led him to a spell which supposedly could summon Satan himself. Johnny was unaware that he in fact had summoned Mephisto. Johnny sold his soul to Mephisto in return for Crash’s cancer to be cured. Mephisto did cure Crash, though Crash died soon after in a stunt trying to jump over 22 cars. Johnny, still at the mercy of Mephisto, believed he would lose his soul to Mephisto until he was saved by Roxanne.  Roxanne proclaimed her love for Johnny, and drove Mephisto away with the purity of her emotion. 

Johnny was unaware that Mephisto had bonded him with the demon [[Zarathos]] as an act of revenge (breaking the deal he made with Naomi Kale) for not being able to obtain Johnny's soul.  Johnny, was transformed into a Ghost Rider, a leather-clothed skeleton, his head cloaked in a sheath of flame, the night after Crash’s death.
 
The character received his own series in 1973, with [[penciler]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciler [[Don Perlin]] began a long stint with #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through #58. This Ghost Rider's career ended when Zarathos fled Blaze's body in issue #81 (June 1983), the finale.

Blaze would mistake '''Noble Kale''' for [[Zarathos]] during the subsequent Ghost Rider series (1990-1998), and after attempting to destroy him, eventually became an ally. Johnny, like his long-lost brother '''Danny Ketch''' (see below), is a direct descendant of Kale (Johnny's true last name is Blaze inherited from his father Barton Blaze. Barbara and Daniel Ketch's true last names remain unknown as their father might or might not be Barton Blaze).  Johnny was supposed to have become Kale's next host, but was spared because of a deal their mother made with Mephisto. However, Johnny became the host for another [[entity]] ([[Zarathos]]), who had been stripped of his memories and was originally under Johnny's control. As the series progressed, that control faded and Zarathos' true personality was evident whenever Ghost Rider was unleashed.

Thomas, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, described the character's genesis:
:"I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' — a very lackluster character — called Stunt-Master... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when Gary Friedrich started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, "Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider." He didn't describe him. I said, "Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it," and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from [[Missouri]], and I said, "That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book." When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, Mike Ploog, who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''1968 Special'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it." [http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html]

Friedrich on the above, in 2001:
:"Well, there's some disagreement between Roy, Mike and I (sic) over that. I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it, I'm gonna sue them, and I probably will. ...It was my idea. It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it, it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle. Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea. But, to tell you the truth, it was ''my'' idea."{{fn|1}}

The third Ghost Rider debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' (1990 series) #1 (May, 1990). '''Daniel Ketch''' and his sister Barbara, attacked by [[gangsters]], fled and hid in a junkyard where Daniel found a motorcycle bearing a mystical [[sigil (magic)|sigil]]. Upon touching the sigil, he was transformed into the Ghost Rider. This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, though his costume and bike had undergone a modernized tailoring. He thrashed the gangsters, but was unable to save Barbara, who had been critically wounded and slipped into a coma. She was eventually killed by [[Blackout (comics)|Blackout]], a lieutenant of the very organization responsible for her state and whom Ketch had acquired as a mortal enemy when his face was scarred by the Ghost Rider's demonic fire.

When Ghost Rider became a part of the [[Midnight Sons]], he died twice in the process. The first person who killed Ghost Rider was the vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], who was at the time possessed by the Darkhold. He was soon revived by the Darkhold Redeemers, along with everyone else who was killed by Blade. The second time he died was when he was fighting [[Zarathos]], but like before, he was once again reborn.

[[Image:Ghost_rider_vol_2_80.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ghost Rider's red and orange leather armor.<br>''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2) #80 (Feb., 1996).<br>Art by [[Salvador Larroca ]].]]
It was later revealed that Daniel Ketch and John Blaze were long-lost brothers and that their family were the inheritors of a mystical curse related to the [[Spirits of Vengeance]]. Ketch eventually seemed to die, but the Spirit of Vengeance that had been bound to him through the bike's talisman lived on. Eventually, in Peter Parker: [[Spider-Man]] #93 (July 1997), it was revealed that Ketch was still alive, and he rebonded with the Noble Kale Ghost Rider.

Unlike Blaze, the Ketch Ghost Rider possessed a ''Penance Stare'' which made the target experience all the pain and suffering they've caused others. He also possessed Hellfire as did the Zarathos/Blaze version, but he also possessed the ability to destroy the undead, and was supposedly Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgement, as revealed in issue 93, which detailed the supposed origins of the Noble Kale version of the Ghost Rider.

In addition, Ketch and Noble Kale actually worked together to an extent, unlike Blaze and Zarathos, who battled for dominance and control over their shared body. Kale had a compassionate side and  while there were times that he seemed tempted to simply take over completely, he refused to do so, though he felt anger at condemning Daniel to only being able to live his life out half the time, while he dominated the other half. Kale and Ketch, like Blaze and Zarathos, could sometimes communicate through dreams, and in at least one issue communicated via messages written on a mirror in lipstick.

==Continuity conundrums==
The current Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider fusion has not clarified whether or not this version of the Spirit of Vengeance is Noble Kale. Several continuity problems point to this being an entirely new Ghost Rider.

Noble Kale, in the final issue of the 1990s ''Ghost Rider'' series, killed [[Blackheart]] and apparently claimed the throne of one of Marvel's many realms of Hell.

After the last issue of Ghost Rider, Noble Kale resurrected Dan and sent him back to Earth as a way of thanking him for their years together. Noble's tenure in Hell was a brief one. He subtly aided Jack Russell, the Werewolf, in tracking down a serial killer, but was forced out of Hell when a coup occurred. Injured and confused, Noble wandered the streets of New York City, his Hellfire raging out of control. This attracted the attention of Spider-Man, who tried to bring his old ally under control, with limited success. Dan arrived at the scene and realized that Noble's powers were fluctuating because he lacked a human host. The two men were forced to merge again and are currently seeking more innocents to avenge. (From Marvel.com official Bio)

However, with the return of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who was responsible in part for Kale becoming the Ghost Rider, Kale may have been deposed from that realm. Since Kale and Danny Ketch merged again in a [[Spider-Man]] comic directly before the release of the 2001 miniseries (an odd retcon, which has still yet to be explained), there is no clear answer as to where Kale actually is or to whom, if anyone, he is bonded. In that same Spider-Man comic, the Ghost Rider, before re-bonding with Ketch, dropped hints that the Noble Kale origin may be false or at least misunderstood. Additionally, in the 2001 miniseries, the Ghost Rider killed humans, an action Kale specifically refused to commit. In addition, Zarathos has resurfaced in modern day continuity during the Daniel Ketch ''Ghost Rider'' series. With a red skull and blue/white flames about his face and hands. He was also referred to as an 'evangelist of hate', and drew upon negative energy from his acolytes to bolster his own massive elemental powers and strength. 

It has never been explained how Centurious and Zarathos have escaped their confinement from the Soul Crystal (they were captured within it in the final issues of the first Ghost Rider series).

In issues of the [[MC2]] continuity which is the home of [[Spider-Girl]] and [[A-Next|Avengers Next]], among others, Zarathos looks reminiscent of his days as the Ghost Rider, in which he appears inside the mind/soul of Darkdevil, which may be a hint as to the identiy of the ''Hammer Lane'' Ghost Rider, whom Blaze spoke to and claimed that his time in that bonding was 'the coolest thing that ever happened in my life'. In addition to this, unlike Zarathos and Kale, who were very vocal during their tenure as the Ghost Rider, this strange third incarnation of the flame-skulled biker only ever spoke a single time, at the very end of the series. His singular line in the series was 'Forgive yourself.' This was in response to Blaze literally begging the Rider to forgive him for putting a contract out on the Ghost Rider's life.

Early in the 1970's Ghost Rider series, Johnny Blaze is helped by Daimon Hellstrom, The Son of Satan. Hellstrom and Ghost Rider battle Satan, and Satan is infuriated with his son. Hellstrom's father is later revealed to be Marduk, while the 'Satan' in early Ghost Rider is revealed to be Mephisto. Mephisto and Marduk are not the same demonic presence, clearly, so this leads to a large contradiction. In addition to this, Satan himself does exist as a demonic presence in Marvel, as Mephisto himself makes mention of him in issue 77 of the 1970s-80s Ghost Rider, when the origins of Zarathos (which made no mention of the Fallen- a group of renegade members of the Blood) were revealed. In addition, Satan himself is revealed to be the primary antagonist of the current ongoing Ghost Rider series, which once more features Johnny Blaze as the Ghost Rider, with powers that appear to be virtually idenitcal to Kale's, such as the Penance Stare along with an appearance that directly mirror's Kale. In issue four of the current series, Blaze actually makes reference to Daniel Ketch's time being bonded to Noble.

The recent six issue mini-series further complicates matters. Zarathos has appeared to be a non-factor. Blaze is in complete control of his actions as the Ghost Rider (as he was when he first became Ghost Rider), and in an interesting twist, is said to have made his deal with the 'devil' thirty years ago, placing his deal in 1975-6 (the first issue of the mini came out in 2005, and the series concluded in early 2006). This does leave room for the events of the Daniel Ketch version of Ghost Rider to have appeared in the canon Marvel universe, along with the events which Blaze was involved in however. There seems to be no clear cut answer about whether or not this recent Ghost Rider mini-series takes place within the original continuity established by the three previous Ghost Riders, the latter two of whom are part of the normal Marvel Universe. (Phantom Rider actually encountered the Johnny Blaze/Zarathos Ghost Rider in the first series featuring the flaming skull-faced Biker.)

Also, the 'devil' is named to be Lucifer in this series, when the later issues of the first Ghost Rider series explicitly name Mephisto to be the entity with whom Blaze made a deal with.

==Johnny Blaze returns==
After Ketch's Ghost Rider series ended, Johnny Blaze returned as the Spirit of Vengeance.

In 2001, a six issue miniseries featuring Johnny Blaze as the Ghost Rider debuted.  Entitled "The Hammer Lane", the story is written by [[Devin Grayson]] and penciled by [[Trent Kaniuga]]. In this [[Marvel Knights]] story, Johnny finds himself able to become the Ghost Rider after spending some time free of the curse.

A second six-issue miniseries by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]], entitled "Road to Damnation," debuted in November 2005. This new series also involves Johnny Blaze, and focuses on his (futile) attempts at escaping from Hell. This series presents Blaze as the human host, with a slightly new look. His new powers include being able to breathe hellfire like a dragon, and launching chains from his throat in the same manner.

In July 2006, a new ongoing monthly series, titled ''Vicious Cycle'' began.  Written by [[Daniel Way]] with art by [[Mark Texeira]] and [[Javier Saltares]], the same artistic team from the 1990 series. The storyline takes place after the Ennis miniseries, and features Johnny Blaze finally escaping hell. The trouble is, in doing so he unwittingly brings the demon Lucifer to Earth, albeit through demonic trickery.

So far Satan has tormented Johnny Blaze and slain many innocents along the way. In the 3rd issue ''Ghost Rider'' battles with ''[[Doctor Strange]],'' believing the sorcerer to be Lucifer in disguise. Doctor Strange uses too much power in the battle and seemingly 'kills' Ghost Rider. However, as he, ''Ghost Rider'', is the Spirit of Vengeance he rises to deliver the 'Penance Stare' (this is the first time the Blaze version of Ghost Rider has used this technique).  

It is subsequently revealed that Lucifer can only exist on Earth in spirit form, and that when he crossed into the mortal realm his essence shattered into 666 separate pieces, each inhabiting a recently deceased body. Lucifer's plan is for each of these bodies to goad people into killing them; as each one dies, the remaining grow stronger until one is left with Lucifer's full powers.  However, the bodies cannot kill each other, since that constitutes suicide and would return Lucifer to Hell.  Blaze's self-avowed task, then, is to capture each of the inhabited bodies and bring them back to Hell.

This particular incarnation of Ghost Rider features Johnny Blaze as the human host, but has the physical appearance of the "Dan Ketch/Noble Kale" Ghost Rider, including the spiked leather jacket and the bike chain weapon/tool he also employs the 'Penace Stare' and seems to be able to control his hellfire (this surprises Johnny, despite the fact he posessed control over the hellfire during the period when Daniel Ketch was the Ghost Rider).  After his battle with Doctor Strange, it would seem that this Ghost Rider is quite possibly more powerful, however this has yet to be fully tested. This would appear a more reflective version to match the Ghost Rider of the upcoming movie.

Note: It is explained in the letters section of issue 2 that Ghost Rider's current design was Javier Saltares' preferred way of drawing Ghost Rider (although one would think Way would have some input into that, writing the character using the chain as a weapon).

==Naomi Kale==
Naomi Kale was revealed to be the mother of John, Daniel and Barbara in a "Flashback" issue of ''Ghost Rider'' (vol. 2). This issue, configured as # -1 (negative one), showed Naomi as a terminally ill woman who had also been host to the Ghost Rider. Prior to her death at the hands of Mephisto, Naomi revealed arrangements for spells to be placed on Johnny (filling his body with hellfire and stopping possession). Naomi hoped this would end the 'curse' of her bloodline, though this was later revealed to simply 'skip' Johnny, resulting in Barbara being the inheritor.

She displayed a wide knowledge of the background of Noble Kale, and possessed the brand on her left hand. After a brief confrontation with Mephisto in Cyprus Hills Cemetery, she finally succumbed to her illness. She was buried along with the motorcycle. Thirteen years later, the bike was unearthed and surrounded by car wrecks, setting the scene for the events of ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (vol. 2).

==The Medallion of Power==

The Medallion of Power was a piece of the Ghost Rider mythos introduced during Daniel Ketch's time bonded with Noble Kale. It was originally introduced as a physical object which took the place of the gas cap on the bike which would glow when it was time for Daniel to change into Ghost Rider. It was also supposedly a spiritual object, with shards embedded in the souls of three people, from two distinct families. The three people were Johnny Blaze, Daniel Ketch, and Michael Badilino. However, the shards were supposed to be kept separated, so that their powers could never be unleashed again. Johnny, Daniel, and Barbara, all of the same family, each had shards. Badilino had the majority if not all, of the shards which had once been entrusted to his family. Each generation would have these shards in their souls. These four were simply the newest bearers, unaware of the fact that they had the medallion's shards inside of them. Mephisto, for reasons unknown, wanted this medallion very badly. Part of his 'deal' with Badilino (in which he assumed he had sold his soul for power) was that Badilino, now called Vengeance in his superhuman form, was to bring the medallion to Mephisto as part of the exchange. The storyline was dropped after the initial return of Zarathos, and seemed to be entirely retconned altogether by the end of Volume Two of Ghost Rider, when the medallion itself was supposedly placed on the gas cap of the bike to which Kale appeared to be symbiotically linked by Pastor Kale, who served directly under Mephisto. The Medallion's design was later revealed to be the mark of Vengeance, and appeared on apparel and/or skin belonging to four other beings who were transformed into Spirits of Vengeance.

==Powers and abilities==
The common theme of the Ghost Rider is a human host who transforms into a flaming head motorcyclist with supernatural powers. When riding their bikes, the vehicles can travel faster than conventional motorcycles and can maneuver impossible feats such as riding straight up a vertical surface or across water. In a one-shot comic featuring Dr. Strange and the Daniel Ketch/Noble Kale version of Ghost Rider, it was shown to be capable of riding on nothing but air. This was repeated shortly after Kale started to regain his memories, causing him to alter his suit by sheer force of will, and created an entirely new bike.

'''Johnny Blaze''' - Initially when transformed, Blaze's motorcycle would simply catch fire. Later, he could create a cycle made of pure flame (hellfire). Hellfire is a supernatural flame which typically burns the soul and not the body, but also could be used as regular flame. Projecting hellfire as a weapon is his main form of attack. He also possesses supernatural strength and resilience.
 
In his current incarnation, Blaze can perform the ''Penance Stare'' associated with the Daniel Ketch version (see below), can breathe hellfire, launch chains from his throat, and has the ability to cross between the mortal plane and the demonic realm, literally going to Hell and back again. 

'''Daniel Ketch''' - When empowered, Ketch's motorcycle undergoes a more radical transformation. It changes from a conventional looking motorcycle to one that appears both powerful and high-tech.  Along with flaming wheels, the bike includes a shield-like battering ram on the front. Like the Blaze/Zarathos version, this Ghost Rider's bike was capable of incredible stunts, such as driving up sheer walls, across water, and in at least two known instances, through the very air itself. Ghost Rider also created two other bikes that he could utilize in the same manner as the one he normally rode, one out of necessity when Blackheart stole the original in a crossover graphic novel that brought together Ghost Rider, Wolverine, and the Punisher, and again in the regular series as a spare in case something made him unable to get to his regular cycle. The latter would wind up in the hands of Johnny Blaze.  As the Ghost Rider, Ketch uses a bike chain, much like those used to lock up bikes when not in use. It grows in length, is supernaturally strong, and can transform into other weapons like [[shuriken]] or a spear. He can also spin it fast to be used as a drill. Daniel's most feared power is the ''Penance Stare''. When in close combat, he locks eyes with his victim and makes them feel every pain that person has ever inflicted on anyone in their lifetime. This, of course, has several weaknesses. If high on drugs like cocaine, or if the person is blind, or if he cannot make eye contact due to the victim having more than two eyes, he cannot get the Penance Stare to function. An attempt to use the Penance Stare on the symbiotic being, Venom, resulted in Ghost Rider being knocked unconscious. This incarnation of the Ghost Rider also has superhuman strength and resilience. He has displayed some other powers briefly, like the ability to summon a wall of flame. In the beginning, Ketch could only transform "when innocent blood was spilled" and had to touch the gascap of his motorcycle. Later it was revealed that this was only a psychological limitation he himself caused. Daniel later overcame these limitations.

==The Ghost Rider's Motorcycles==
Early stories of the Blaze/Zarathos version featured the Ghost Rider using conventional motorcycles, sometimes modified for stunt-riding.  The most common was a touring model with a skull-shaped fairing, which was dubbed the ''Skull-Cycle.''  When the character learned to use his hellfire to create a flaming motorcycle, the actual model varied according to the artist, from a conventional touring version to a spiked chopper.
Besides the high-tech version of the Skull-Cycle, Dan Ketch also inadvertently transformed another motorcycle (which he happened to be sitting on) into a "Ghost Rider" model, with a skull-silhouette covering the main headlamp and flaming tires. (This happened in the graphic novel "Hearts of Darkness" featuring the Punisher and Wolverine.) This model was later used by Blaze when he appeared as a supporting character in the Ketch series.  
During the "Hammer Lane" mini-series Blaze also demonstrated the ability to transform a regular motorcycle into a "Ghost Rider" model with flaming tires.

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==
There have been three other notable Spirits of Vengeance in the Marvel universe:

===Vengeance===
:''Main article: [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]''

'''Michael Badilino''', a former member of the NYPD, is one third of an "Organic Medallion of Power". (the other two were Ketch and Blaze. The Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail. And despite belief that the Medallion preceeds the Noble Kale incarnation of the Spirit of Vengeance, it appears to be the other way around, given the origin recounted for Kale in the 1990-98 series.) He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, though he did possess the Penance Stare and his motorcycle also seemed to share characteristics with the version used by the Daniel Ketch/Noble Kale version of Ghost Rider. He was characterised by his skull being deep purple, by fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and large spike protrusions with a backswept curve on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by the name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire (the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider).

Vengeance would reappear in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aided the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, and Blackheart was destroyed. Vengeance's current status is unknown.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] alternate future, [[Kaine]] summons [[Zarathos]] in an attempt to save the life of his nephew, [[Darkdevil|Reilly Tyne]] (the son of [[Ben Reilly]] and Elizabeth Tyne) who is dying because he has inherited the genetic defects from his father’s [[human cloning|cloned]] physiology. This backfired, however when Zarathos attempted to claim Reilly’s body as his own. At the same time, Kaine was also trying to bring [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] (who had been killed by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] while saving Kaine's life) back to life. The soul of Daredevil also took up residence in Reilly's body. The forces of the two spirits residing within him tend to keep each other in check—Reilly gained Zarathos’ physical appearance, demonic and regenerative powers which keep him alive and the influence of Murdock keeps him from becoming corrupted. Under the influence of these two entities residing within him, Reilly decides to become the hero [[Darkdevil]]. Zarathos appears in Reilly's consciousness as the Ghost Rider.

===Ghost Rider 2099===
'''Kenshiro "Zero" Cochrane''', who in the [[Marvel 2099]] alternate timeline is a cybernetic take on the Spirit of Vengeance, was not a supernatural being, but a cybernetic being with a digitized copy of Cochrane's mind. He encountered a futuristic counterpoint to Michael Badilino's Vengeance. The Ghost Rider of 2099 appeared to drop out of existence during the consolidation of the 2099 books into a single title called ''2099 World of Tomorrow'', sans a single page at the very end of the series, showing a D/Monix agent who is salvaging the G.R.'s damaged robotic body from an unspecified underwater location. He subsequently appeared in the 2099 "epilogue" book ''Manifest Destiny'', arguing with the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]s that empowered him.

===The Spirit of Vengeance===
This version debuted in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', set in an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. He joined an offshoot group calling themselves the Galactic Guardians. This Ghost Rider was a religious zealot, embittered toward a church proclaiming it would produce its god in the flesh for reasons never completely explained. That being, the Protege, was destroyed by the [[Celestial]] Scathan the Approver. Whether or not this Ghost Rider, who referred to himself simply as the Spirit of Vengeance, overcame his bitterness at the Protege after hearing of his destruction, is unknown.

===Pop culture===

* There is a song called "Ghost Rider" written by the New York punk/electronic band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] (made up of Alan Vega and Martin Rev) from their self-titled 1977 album. The comic was purportedly a favourite of Alan Vega's, many of the lyrics easily corroborate this, with such lyrics as "Riding through your town with his head on fire", "riding around in a blue jumpsuit" and repeated usage of the words "motorcycle hero." The song has also been covered multiple times by bands such as the [[Rollins Band]].

* European Metal band, [[Hammerfall]], makes reference to a motorcycle rider who "...lost his liberty and the only woman that he loved" and rides on his motorcycle at night, "From the dead of night he will arise". Many fans have    c ommented on the similarities to Ghost Rider, but the band has yet to acknowledge or reject the theory, "On through the night he rides, on his raging horse made of steel Nothing can save you now, before the renegade you will kneel".

* [[Method Man]] of the world-famous rap group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] often refers to his hip-hop alter-ego as Johnny Blaze, much like his fellow Clansman [[Ghostface Killah]] uses the name Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]). In the music video "Triumph", [[Method Man]] is riding on a bike with flames as he raps.

* In 2005, the all-girl Filipino rock band [[Prettier Than Pink]] recorded the tribute ballad "Johnny Blaze" for their "Chop Suey" CD. It was released on Sutton Records.

*The Danish rock band, The Raveonettes, have a  song entitled "Attack of the Ghost Riders". In the video for this song, the lead singer Sune Rose Wagner is seen as Ghost Rider at the end of the video. They also covered 'Ghost Rider' on the [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] tribute album. 

* Ghost Rider's flaming skull is said to have served as the inspiration for [[Mortal Kombat]]'s [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] as Scorpion's alternative costume in both the games and various media is a flaming skull.

*''Ghost Rider'' was used as a [[call sign]] for Maverick's F-14 in the film [[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]], which popularized the phrase "negative, Ghost Rider."

*Ghost Rider is also a [[roller coaster]] ride in [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park]], California

*"Ghost Rider" is the name of a weapons system in the [[Honor Harrington]] [[Space opera|space-opera]] series by [[David Weber]], published by [[Baen Books]].

*''Ghost Rider'' is the name of a song by the prog-rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]].  It's the third track on their 17th studio album [[Vapor Trails]].  It has nothing to do with the comic book.  Rather, it is a diary song written by [[Neil Peart]] about his motorcycle trek across North America after the deaths of his wife and daughter.  See also [[Ghost Rider (book)]].

* Ghost Rider is the favorite comic book character of [[WWE]] Superstar and avid comic book reader, [[Rob Van Dam]].

*"Ghost Rider" is also the title of a school bus safety film produced by Penn State Public Broadcasting in 1982.
