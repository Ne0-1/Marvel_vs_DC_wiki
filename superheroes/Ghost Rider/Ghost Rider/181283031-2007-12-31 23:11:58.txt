'''Ghost Rider''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supernatural]] [[anti-hero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Marvel had previously used the name for a [[Western fiction|Western]] character whose name was later changed to 'Night Rider' and subsequently to '[[Phantom Rider]]'.

The first [[supernatural]] Ghost Rider is [[stunt]] [[motorcycle|motorcyclist]] '''Johnny Blaze''', who, in order to save the life of his mentor, agreed to give his soul to "[[Satan]]" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]). Instead, his soul bonded with the entity called [[Zarathos]]. When utilizing Zarathos' powers Blaze's flesh is consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull, and he wields a fiery motorcycle and trademark blasts of hellfire from his skeletal hands. He starred in the series from 1973-1983.

The subsequent ''Ghost Rider'' series (1990-98) featured '''Daniel Ketch''' as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle which had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a "Spirit of Vengeance."  This spirit had originally been a [[Puritan]] man named [[Noble Kale]], an ancestor of both Blaze and Ketch. Johnny Blaze reappeared in this series as a [[supporting character]] and was revealed to be Ketch's brother.

==Johnny Blaze==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)}}
Following the [[Phantom Rider|western comics character]] who originally used the name, this Ghost Rider [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' vol. 1, #5 (Aug. 1972), created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Roy Thomas]], writer [[Gary Friedrich]], and [[artist]] [[Mike Ploog]].

Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt performer in a traveling circus, sold his soul to who he believes was [[Satan]] but actually is the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (a [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]), in order to save the life of his stepfather, "Crash" Simpson. Blaze's [[soul]] was bound with the demon [[Zarathos]] and transformed into a leather-clothed skeleton, his head cloaked in a sheath of flame. The character received his own series in 1973, with [[penciller]] [[Jim Mooney]] handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller [[Don Perlin]] began a long stint with #26, eventually joined by writer [[Michael Fleisher]] through #58. This Ghost Rider's career ended when Zarathos fled Blaze's body in issue #81 (June 1983), the finale, in order to pursue [[Centurious]], a villain introduced near the end of the series' run with whom Zarathos had a history.
<!--[[Image:Ghost Rider 1.jpg|thumb|left|''Ghost Rider'' (1973 series) #1. Cover art by [[Gil Kane]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]-->

Blaze mistook [[Noble Kale]] (an earlier Ghost Rider, the first known to have used the name in links with the supernatural) for [[Zarathos]] during the subsequent Ghost Rider series (1990-1998), and after attempting to destroy him, eventually accepted the truth that he was not Zarathos and became an ally. Johnny, like his long-lost brother, '''Danny Ketch''' (see below), is a direct descendant of Kale. Johnny's true last name is Blaze, inherited from his father Barton Blaze.

Kale intended Johnny Blaze to become his next host, but because of a deal their mother, Naomi, had with Mephisto, Blaze was "spared" this fate. Instead, [[Zarathos]], who had been stripped of his memories and was originally under Blaze's control, made Blaze his next host. As the series progressed, that control faded and Zarathos' true personality was evident whenever Ghost Rider was unleashed.

Thomas, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, described the character's genesis:
{{cquote|I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' — a very lackluster character — called Stunt-Master... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when Gary Friedrich started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, "Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider." He didn't describe him. I said, "Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it," and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from [[Missouri]], and I said, "That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book." When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, Mike Ploog, who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''1968 Special'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it.<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html ''Comic Book Artist'' (May 2001): "Roy Thomas Interview: Son of Stan's Years of Horror"]</ref>}}

Friedrich on the above, in 2001:
{{cquote|Well, there's some disagreement between Roy, Mike, and I over that. I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it, I'm gonna sue them, and I probably will. ...It was my idea. It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it, it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle. Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea. But, to tell you the truth, it was ''my'' idea.<ref>Gary Friedrich interview, ''Comic Book Artist'' (May 2001), p. 84</ref>}}

On April 4, 2007, Friedrich sued [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Enterprises]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures]], Relativity Media, Crystal Sky Pictures, [[Michael DeLuca]] Productions, [[Hasbro]], and [[Take-Two Interactive]], alleging his [[copyright]]s to the Ghost Rider character have been exploited and used in a "joint venture and conspiracy". The [[lawsuit]] states that the film rights and [[merchandising]] reverted from Marvel to him in 2001.<ref>[http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=19535 ''Animation World News'' (April 11, 2007): "Ghost Rider Creator Sues Marvel, Sony & More"]</ref>

==Daniel Ketch==
{{main|Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)}}
The third Ghost Rider debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3, #1 (May 1990). '''Daniel Ketch''' and his sister Barbara, attacked by [[ninja]] [[gangster]]s, fled and hid in a junkyard where Daniel found a motorcycle bearing a mystical [[sigil (magic)|sigil]]. Upon touching the symbol he was transformed into the Ghost Rider. This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume and bike underwent a modernized tailoring, consisting of a black leather [[rocker jacket|biker jacket]] with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants with a wallet chain, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle appeared as a futuristic, [[high-tech]] machine, with a wind-shield at the front that would lower to serve as a battering ram on occasions, but the wheels of mystic hellfire remained the same as the original bike.  He thrashed the gangsters, but was unable to save Barbara, who had been critically wounded and slipped into a coma. She was eventually killed by [[Blackout (comics)#Blackout (Vampire)|Blackout]], a lieutenant of the very organization responsible for her state and whom Ketch had acquired as a mortal enemy when his face was scarred by the Ghost Rider's demonic fire.

When Ghost Rider became a part of the [[Midnight Sons]], he died twice in the process. The first person to kill Ghost Rider was the vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], who was at the time possessed by the Darkhold. He was soon revived by the Darkhold Redeemers, along with everyone else who was killed by Blade. The second time he died was when he was fighting [[Zarathos]], but as before, he was once again reborn.
<!--
[[Image:GhostRider_vol_2_issue_1.jpg|thumb|left|''Ghost Rider''vol. 2, #1.<br>Cover art by [[Javier Saltares]].]]-->

It was later revealed that Ketch and Blaze were long-lost brothers and that their family were the inheritors of a mystical curse related to the Spirits of Vengeance. Ketch eventually died, but the Spirit of Vengeance that had been bound to him through the bike's talisman lived on. ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume One (1990-1998)|Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #93 (July 1997) revealed that Ketch was still alive, and that he had bonded with the Noble Kale Ghost Rider once again. 

Unlike Blaze, the Ketch Ghost Rider possesses a "Penance Stare" that made the target experience all the pain and suffering he or she had caused others — as the target discovers, this is a punishment far, far worse than death. (However, as of recent times, the Blaze Ghost Rider has also been able to use this ability.) He possesses Hellfire, as does the Zarathos/Blaze version, as well as the ability to destroy the undead. Issue #91 (Dec. 1997) revealed him as Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment.

In addition, Ketch and Noble Kale actually work together to some extent, unlike Blaze and Zarathos, who battle for dominance and control over their shared body. Kale has a compassionate side and while there are times that he seems tempted to simply take over completely, he refuses to do so, though he feels remorse at condemning Daniel to only being able to live his life out half the time, while he dominated the other half. Kale and Ketch, like Blaze and Zarathos, can sometimes communicate through dreams, and, in at least one issue, communicated via messages written on a mirror in lipstick.

The series ended with a [[cliffhanger]] in vol. 3, #93 (Feb. 1998). Marvel finally published the long-completed final issue nine years later as ''Ghost Rider Finale'' (Jan. 2007), which reprints vol. 2, #93 and the previously unpublished #94. Note: While the cover reads ''Ghost Rider'' #94, the comic's postal indicia lists the official title as ''Ghost Rider Finale''.

Following the Ghost Rider/Ketch series, Johnny Blaze once again became the Ghost Rider.

==Johnny Blaze returns==
A six-issue [[limited series|miniseries]], again featuring Blaze as the Ghost Rider, debuted in 2001 under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.  Subtitled "The Hammer Lane," it was written by [[Devin K. Grayson]] and penciled by Trent Kaniuga. In this arc, Blaze finds he is once more able to become the Ghost Rider after spending some time free of the curse.

A second six-issue miniseries, by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]], subtitled "Road to Damnation," debuted November 2005. This series also featured Blaze and focused on his futile attempts at escaping from Hell. His powers here include being able to breathe hellfire like a dragon and launching chains from his throat.

In July 2006, a new ongoing monthly series, titled simply ''Ghost Rider,'' began.  Written by [[Daniel Way]] with art by [[Mark Texeira]], it takes place after the Ennis miniseries. It features Blaze still in Hell, desperately trying to escape. At the end of the first issue, he is manipulated into bringing Satan to Earth. This particular incarnation of Ghost Rider features Blaze as the human host. Blaze's Ghost Rider appearance is similar to Daniel Ketch's, a change that assistant editor Michael O'Connor attributes to the manifestation of Ghost Rider's powers themselves.

==Powers and abilities== 
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a demonic motorcyclist with a flaming skull and supernatural powers. The motorcycles he rides can travel faster than conventional motorcycles and can perform such otherwise impossible feats as riding up a vertical surface or across the surface of water. The Danny Ketch/Noble Kale version of Ghost Rider was capable of traveling into the air while on the bike, but this power appeared only twice in the entirety of the character's run.

*'''Johnny Blaze''' - When Blaze transforms, his motorcycle catches fire, and he can create a cycle from pure hellfire. Hellfire is a supernatural flame which sears the soul and burns the flesh of an individual. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. In Ghost Rider form, he displays supernatural strength and resilience. Blaze can perform supernatural stunts on his motorcycle. Later, Blaze developed Danny Ketch's powers in addition to his own, with control over the "Penance Stare" and the ability to manipulate an enchanted chain. He also gained new abilities, such as hellfire breath and the ability to spew chains from either his throat or chest.  Finally, he gained the ability to travel between the incorporeal and material planes.

*'''Daniel Ketch''' - When Ketch transforms, his motorcycle undergoes a more radical transformation, changing from a conventional into a high-tech motorcycle. Along with flaming wheels, the bike includes a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch uses a bike chain, much like a bike lock, that can grow in length, is very resilient, and can transform into various other weapons. Daniel's most famous power is the ''Penance Stare'': when in close combat, he locks eyes with his victim and makes him or her feel every pain that individual has ever inflicted on anyone in their lifetimes. This incarnation of the Ghost Rider also originally could transform only "when innocent blood was spilled" and had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle before the transformation process would begin; he later overcame these dependencies.

==Marvel Zombies==
One panel of a story arc in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' depicts some unspecified zombie-planet version of Ghost Rider.

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==
There have been four other Spirits of Vengeance in the Marvel universe:

===Vengeance===
{{main|Vengeance (comics)}}

'''Michael Badilino''', an ex-member of the [[New York City Police Department]], is one third of an "Organic Medallion of Power"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze. (The Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail.) He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called '''Vengeance''', and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2, involved in [[Blackheart]]'s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.

===Ghost Rider 2099===
{{main|Ghost Rider 2099}}
[[Image:Ghost Rider 2099 2 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Ghost Rider 2099]]'''Zero Cochrane''', who in the [[Marvel 2099]] alternate timeline is a cybernetic take on the Spirit of Vengeance, is not a supernatural being, but a cybernetic being with a digitized copy of Cochrane's mind. He encounters a futuristic counterpoint to Michael Badilino's Vengeance. The Ghost Rider of 2099 appears to drop out of existence during the consolidation of the 2099 books into a single title called ''2099 World of Tomorrow.'' He subsequently appears in the 2099 "epilogue" book ''Manifest Destiny'', arguing with the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] that empowers him.

===The Spirit of Vengeance===
This version debuted in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', set in an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. He has the ability to traverse space and fire spike projectiles from his forearms. This Ghost Rider is a religious zealot, embittered toward a church (a version of the [[Universal Church of Truth]]) proclaiming it would produce its god in the flesh. That being, the Protege, is destroyed by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] Scathan the Approver. This Ghost Rider refers to himself simply as the Spirit of Vengeance, although his real name is given as Wileaydus, from the planet Sarka. Summoned by Martinex to help a planet in peril, this Ghost Rider eventually helps to destroy the threat. They are assisted by several other powerful beings, including [[Wonder Man|Hollywood]], [[Replica (comics)|Replica]] and [[Firelord#Guardians of the Galaxy|Firelord]]. The heroes, rallied by Martinex, decide to stay together as the new [[Galactic Guardians]].

===Trail of Tears===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the [[limited series|miniseries]] ''Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears'' #1-6 (April-Sept. 2007) by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Clayton Crain]]. Set during the [[American Civil War]], it finds Confederate officer Travis Parham avenging the murders of his  friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

===Movies===
{{main|Ghost Rider (film)}}
*[[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]]/[[Columbia Pictures]] released a [[film|movie]] starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as Ghost Rider on [[February 16]], [[2007 in film|2007]]. The character faces [[Blackheart]] and his father, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259324// |title=Ghost Rider IMDb|accessdate=2007-05-03 }}</ref>

===Television commercial===
*Ghost Rider appears in a 2007 [[television advertisement|TV commercial]] for the [[Jackson Hewitt]] [[tax]]-preparation service, intended as a [[tie-in]] with the 2007 movie, showing him handing in a burning [[Tax forms in the United States#W-2|W-2]] form. At the end, he sets off the office [[fire sprinkler|sprinkler]] system.

===Animation===
* Ghost Rider made a cameo appearance in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' in "The Prison Plot" as one of the illusions shown by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].

* Ghost Rider has appeared in the ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series on the [[UPN|UPN Network]], and in the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "When Calls [[Galactus]]." [[Richard Grieco]] provided Ghost Rider's voice on both occasions. This Ghost Rider was the Daniel Ketch version, as he used the penance stare both times.
** It was due to his usage on the UPN cartoons that caused a planned appearance on [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]] to be rejected.  The episode would have pitted Ghost Rider and Spider-Man against [[Mysterio]] and [[Dormammu]].[http://members.aol.com/drg4/semper.html]

* The Ghost Rider appeared briefly as a memory in [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s mind during the 1990s [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]]; he did not speak on that occasion.

===Literature===
* The Ghost Rider appears in a novelization of the film released on February 16, 2007. This book ties the movie incarnation of the character to the mainstream Marvel universe, with references to [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock/Daredevil]]. In the novelization, Blaze takes on the general appearance and most of the powers of the Daniel Ketch Ghost Rider, and seems to have at least partial control over the Ghost Rider, though the entity also seems to have a personality of its own. Neither seems to have any attempt to dominate the other, though Blaze learns how to suppress and will the change by the book's end.

===Video games===

*Ghost Rider is a supporting character in the 1995 [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] video game, ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety]]''. 

*Ghost Rider makes a cameo appearance riding up the side of a building in the "Race to the Bugle" level of the 2000 ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' [[Activision]] game. (In What if... mode)

*Ghost Rider is featured as a secret character in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. The player unlocks him when Mephisto's Realm is reached, but must trade another character to free him; however, soon afterward both Ghost Rider and the traded character are freed. [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]], [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Daniel Ketch]] and the [[Phantom Rider]] are both unlockable as costumes for Ghost Rider in the game.

*[[2K Games]] and [[Climax Group]] released a [[Ghost Rider (video game)|game]] based on the Ghost Rider movie on [[February 13]], [[2007 in video gaming|2007]]. The game is a sequel to the movie, in which players can play Ghost Rider both on foot or on the Hellcycle. The on-foot combat is very similar to that of ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', which also featured chain attacks as a main part of combat. When on the Hellcycle, Ghost Rider is still capable of performing many of the same chain attacks, and can shoot hellfire. The hellfire attack can later be upgraded so that it fires three projectiles at once and lock on to their targets. After defeating [[Blackheart]], players gain the ability to replay not only as Ghost Rider, but [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]] and [[Ghost Rider 2099]] , both of whom have the same abilities as Ghost Rider. Players are also able to play as [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], who has two main katana attacks and heals by drinking the blood of enemies. If players complete the game on extreme difficulty, they unlock classic Ghost Rider.

===Merchandise/toys===
* In addition to a standalone line of Ghost Rider toys featuring Ketch's incarnation and his allies and foes, [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]] produced a [[scale model|model kit]] ("Advanced Level 3", the only one in that particular series) of Kale with his motorcycle. It stands 8.75 inches tall, and needs glue for completion.
* Three Ghost Rider [[action figure]]s appear in the [[Marvel Legends]] series, one each of Danny Ketch, Johnny Blaze, and Johnny Blaze in mid-transformation. A Vengeance figure was released in the "Legendary Riders" series.
* Medicom Toy Co. has produced two Ghost Rider figures in conjunction with the new Ghost Rider movie.  One is a super-deformed vinyl collectible doll that stands 5 inches tall and the other is from the Medicom Toy Co. Real Action Hero 12-inch figure collection and features a highly detailed rendition of Ghost Rider in 12-inch form.

===Pop culture===
*The song "Ghost Rider," written by the New York City punk/electronic band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] (Alan Vega and Martin Rev) appears on the band's [[Suicide (album)|self-titled 1977 album]]. The song has been covered by such bands as the [[Rollins Band]] and [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]]

*In 2005, the all-girl Filipino rock band [[Prettier Than Pink]] recorded the tribute ballad "Johnny Blaze" for the CD ''Chop Suey'' (Sutton Records).

*The Danish rock band The Raveonettes has a song entitled "Attack of the Ghost Riders." Lead singer Sune Rose Wagner is seen as Ghost Rider at the end of the accompanying video. The band also covered the song "Ghost Rider" on the ''[[Suicide (band)|Suicide]]'' tribute album.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

*Rapper/actor [[Method Man]] is a Ghost Rider fan who sometimes uses the alias "Johnny Blaze,"{{Fact|date=June 2007}} although this may also be due to the connotative association of the word blaze with marijuana.

*In the Nickelodeon show [[Danny Phantom]], there is a villain named Johnny who (also is a ghost, making him a ghost rider, figuratively) rides a ghost motorcycle. Instead of a chain, he uses a violent shadow to do his bidding.

*[[Scorpion]] from [[Mortal Kombat]] was inspired by Ghost Rider because of his flaming skull head. He also made a reference in the [[Malibu Comics]] when he grabbed Sub-Zero and said "Look into my eyes!"
