'''Mammoth''' (real name '''Baran Flinders''') is a [[fictional character]] and [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] from [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Mammoth first appeared in ''New Teen Titans'' #3 and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Pérez]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mammoth is one of the founding members of the [[Fearsome Five]], and became enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], [[Superman]], and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name="dc-fear">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Fearsome Five | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 120  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->}}</ref> He is highly devoted to his sister Selinda (a.k.a. [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]]), also a founding member of the Fearsome Five. A towering hulk of a man with immense physical strength and durability, Mammoth is intellectually and emotionally underdeveloped (so much so that he was once tricked into surrendering to a Superman whose powers had recently been lost thanks to [[Lex Luthor]]'s use of [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]'s [[Kryptonite|red kryptonite]] thanks to Superman simply faking confidence that he could defeat Mammoth), and he lacks skill as a hand-to-hand combatant.

Mammoth at one point retired to a Tibetan monastery along with his sister although shortly thereafter discovered [[Psimon]] (himself a former member of the Fearsome Five). Psimon used his mental abilities to subdue Mammoth and turn Shimmer into glass, which he then proceeded to shatter in an act of vengeance.<ref>''New Titans'' #116 (December 1994)</ref> Mammoth subsequently works with former ally [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]], apparently unable to comprehend his sister was dead, and believing they were looking for her.

Mammoth later appears in a fight with [[Booster Gold]], which he loses. He is surprised at being found out, as his crime was a spur-of-the-moment deal (he did not understand Gold has access to future information).<ref>''52'' #1 DC Comics. 2006</ref>

Mammoth alongside his Fearsome Five teammates appeared as members of the [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

On the cover of ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #13 (Vol. 2), it shows Mammoth as a member of the new [[Injustice League]] and is one of the villains featured in [[Salvation Run]]. He is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

Mammoth later appeared as a member of [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. He was among the villains in the ambush of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] led by [[Tapeworm (comics)|Tapeworm]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #29 (September 2009)</ref>

Mammoth later appeared as a member of the revived Fearsome Five when his sister breaks him out of jail, while he was trying to read to increase his intelligence, though, this only gives him words that do not fit the sentences they are in. His new-found "intelligence" does not quell his need to kill others, as he frequently suggests killing Wonder Girl while they have her bound in her own Lasso.

Mammoth is later shown in the employ of [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], and is hired to capture the members of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] while they are celebrating at a male strip club.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #7</ref>

===The New 52 ===

The group is shown as part of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], which were working with the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. Mammoth was sent by Grid with the other members if the Fearsome Five, [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]], [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]], [[Psimon (comics)|Psimon]], among [[Doctor Psycho]] and [[Hector Hammond]] where they had to fight against [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Metal Men|The Metal Men]]. He ends up defeated by Lead.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #29</ref>

Mammoth later appears where he is trying to kill [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Donna Troy]] and [[Garth (comics)|Garth]]. He is beaten by a teamwork punch by Garth and Donna Troy.<ref>''Titans Hunt'' #5-6</ref>
