'''Mammoth''' (real name '''Baran Flinders'''), a [[fictional character]] and [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] from [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by [[George Pérez]] and [[Marv Wolfman]].

==Fictional character biography==
He first appeared in ''New Teen Titans'' #3 (January 1981) as one of the founding members of the [[Fearsome Five]], and became enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], [[Superman]], and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref name="dc-fear">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Fearsome Five | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 120  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->}}</ref> He is highly devoted to his sister Selinda (a.k.a. [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]]), also a founding member of the Fearsome Five. A towering hulk of a man with immense physical strength and durability, Mammoth is intellectually and emotionally underdeveloped (so much so that he was once tricked into surrendering to a Superman whose powers had recently been lost thanks to [[Lex Luthor]]'s use of [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]'s [[Kryptonite|red kryptonite]] thanks to Superman simply faking confidence that he could defeat Mammoth), and he lacks skill as a hand-to-hand combatant.

Mammoth at one point retired to a Tibetan monastery along with his sister although shortly thereafter discovered [[Psimon]] (himself a former member of the Fearsome Five). Psimon used his mental abilities to subdue Mammoth and turn Shimmer into glass, which he then proceeded to shatter in an act of vengeance.<ref>''New Titans'' #116 (December 1994)</ref> Mammoth subsequently works with former ally [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]], apparently unable to comprehend his sister was dead, and believing they were looking for her.

Mammoth later appears in a fight with [[Booster Gold]], which he loses. He is surprised at being found out, as his crime was a spur-of-the-moment deal (he did not understand Gold has access to future information).<ref>''52'' #1 DC Comics. 2006</ref>

Mammoth alongside his Fearsome Five teammates appeared as members of the [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

On the cover of ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #13 (Vol. 2), it shows Mammoth as a member of the new [[Injustice League]] and is one of the villains featured in [[Salvation Run]]. He is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

Mammoth later appeared as a member of [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. He was among the villains in the ambush of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] led by [[Tapeworm (comics)|Tapeworm]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #29 (September 2009)</ref>

Mammoth later appeared as a member of the revived Fearsome Five when his sister breaks him out of jail, while he was trying to read to increase his intelligence, though, this only gives him words that do not fit the sentences they are in. His new-found "intelligence" does not quell his need to kill others, as he frequently suggests killing Wonder Girl while they have her bound in her own Lasso.

Mammoth is later shown in the employ of [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], and is hired to capture the members of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] while they are celebrating at a male strip club.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mammoth has superhuman strength and endurance. He has some degree of protection from physical and energy attacks.

==Other versions==
In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #3, Mammoth appears as part of a group of villains who attack the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Aquaman]] in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He is blasted by the Vision, but is finally knocked out by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* Mammoth appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Mammoth was a member of the former [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy. Mammoth's personality is not much more than an over-sized class bully: big and strong, but not too bright. He works in a group with [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]] and Gizmo. Mammoth later forms The H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E. with the two above and [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#See-More|See-More]] and [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] He becomes the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E.'s muscle (Jinx is the leader, Gizmo is its resident genius, and See-More and Private H.I.V.E. provide defense) and is messed with by Kid Flash by getting pantsed by him to expose his cherry boxers. (The irony is that during one instance where Kid Flash took back a candy bar it is revealed that Mammoth had actually paid for it). He is ordered by the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] to take out [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. Instead, he knocks Cyborg into an abyss, only for Cyborg to later reemerge inside the Brotherhood's secret hideout with [[Kole]] and [[Gnarrk]] (Cyborg even taunts Mammoth for failing to finish the job by defiantly shouting, "Lesson number one: Never throw me down a hole unless you make sure I ''stay'' there!"). Mammoth returns to the Brotherhood of Evil's secret headquarters in "Titans Together" where five Titans encounter him and three other villains hurry to watch [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] being flash-frozen. [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]], in the body of [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Cinderblock|Cinderblock]], released [[Pantha]], [[Más y Menos|Más]], [[Beast Boy]], and [[Mal Duncan|Herald]], and Mammoth's face is burned by Pantha's claw. During the final battle, he is stunned by Jinx's betrayal long enough for her to cause a massive hex wave that knocks all five of the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E off their feet. Mammoth is tossed into the flash-freezing machine and flash-frozen with most of the other villains.

* Mammoth appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''. In "Drop Zone", he and his sister Shimmer are reimagined as enforcers for [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]]'s drug-producing operations. Unlike the comics where Mammoth is described as having been born with his abilities, here he is portrayed as a scrawny teenager who gains his monstrous strength and appearance from a combination of the [[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]] steroid and the [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster formula]] being injected into his body. Though he is shown to be powerful enough to easily trounce [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] in combat, he is ultimately defeated after being electrocuted into unconsciousness by [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]]. He later appears in the episode "Terrors" where he is shown as an inmate at [[Belle Reve]]. He acted as a bodyguard for [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Sr.]] and other high ranking prisoners. He assists in a breakout attempt orchestrated by [[Mr. Freeze]], but is defeated by the combined efforts of Superboy and Icicle Jr., and is last shown frozen to a wall. In "Usual Suspects," Mammoth joins [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], [[Riddler]], and Shimmer into ambushing the Team at a crashed airplane. He is defeated by Superboy. In "Beneath," Mammoth assists Shimmer, Icicle Jr. [[Psimon]], and [[Devastation (comics)|Devastation]] into guarding a shipment of runaway children who are to be delivered to The Light's Partner. During a fight with the female members of Young Justice, [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] knocks Devastation into Mammoth enough for both of them to be knocked away from the plane. Mammoth is later seen holding his unconscious sister in his arms. In "Intervention," Mammoth was seen in Bialya with Shimmer and Devastation. While Rocket maintains the force bubble around Blue Beetle, Zatanna uses a spell to get Devastation to collide with Mammoth and Shimmer enough to knock them out. When they come to, Queen Bee later reveals that it their defeat was all part of her plan.

* Mammoth mainly makes appearances with the H.I.V.E Five in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' series. He debuts a small appearance in the episode "Gorilla" where the Titans were fighting him. Robin asks Beast Boy (in his gorilla form) for help, but refuses and Mammoth escapes. Out of all his appearances so far, Mammoth is mute alongside See-More and Billy Numerous.

===Video games===
* Mammoth is also a [[boss (video games)|boss]] in both ''[[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]]'' video games.
* Mammoth appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' as part of the "Sons of Trigon" [[downloadable content]].

===Miscellaneous===
* Mammoth makes appearances with his fellow students in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic book series.
