In the animated series, Mammoth is a member of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy. His personality is not much more than an oversized class bully: big and strong, but not too bright. He works in a group with [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]] and [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]]. He later forms The HIVE Five with the two above and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]] and [[Minor Characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private Hive|Private Hive]]. He becomes the HIVE Five's muscle (Jinx is the leader, Gizmo is its resident genius, and See-More and Private HIVE provide defense).
