'''Mammoth''' is the alias of '''Baran Flinders''', a [[fictional character]] that is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] from [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by [[George Perez]] and [[Marv Wolfman]].  He first appeared in ''New Teen Titans'' #3 (January 1981) as one of the founding members of the [[Fearsome Five]], and became enemy of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], [[Superman]], and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].  He is highly devoted to his sister Selinda (a.k.a. [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]]), also a founding member of the Fearsome Five.  A towering hulk of a man with immense physical strength and invulnerability, Mammoth is intellectually and emotionally underdeveloped, and he lacks skill as a hand-to-hand combatant.

* Mammoth is also a [[boss (video games)|boss]] in both ''[[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]]'' video games.

===''Teen Titans'' animated series===
In the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, Mammoth was a member of the former [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy. He is voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Mammoth's personality is not much more than an oversized class bully: big and strong, but not too bright. He works in a group with [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]] and Gizmo. 

Mammoth later forms The H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E. with the two above and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]] and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] He becomes the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E.'s muscle (Jinx is the leader, Gizmo is its resident genius, and See-More and Private H.I.V.E. provide defense). He is ordered by the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] to take out [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. Instead, he knocks Cyborg into an abyss, only to reemerge inside the Brotherhood's secret hideout with [[Kole]] and [[Gnarrk]]. 

Mammoth returns to the Brotherhood of Evil's secret headquarters in "Titans Together" where five Titans encounter him and three other villains hurrying to watch [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] being flash-freezed. [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]], disguised as [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Cinderblock|Cinderblock]], released [[Pantha]], [[Más Y Menos|Más]], [[Beast Boy]] and [[Herald (comics)|Herald]], and Mammoth's face is burned by Pantha's claw. During the final battle, he is stunned by Jinx's betrayal long enough for her to cause a massive hex wave that knocks all five of the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E off their feet. Mammoth is tossed into the flash-freezing machine and is frozen with all of the other villains.
