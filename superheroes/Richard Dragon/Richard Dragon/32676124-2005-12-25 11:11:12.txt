'''''Richard Dragon, [[Kung Fu]] Fighter''''', is a [[DC Comics]] [[comic book]]. 

In it, the eponymous hero was a [[thief]] who was trained in [[martial arts]] and decides to use his abilities for good. With his comrades [[Lady Shiva]], [[Bronze Tiger]] and [[Batman]], he is one of the top [[martial artist]]s in the [[DC Universe]].

Years ago, sneak thief Richard Dragon visited Kyoto for a theft, and was approached by an old man called the O-Sensei, who taught Richard how to master the martial arts. Although his only desire was peace, such was not his destiny. Eventually, Richard became an agent of the espionage organization called G.O.O.D. and battled international threats such as Guano Cravat, Telegram Sam, the Preying Mantis, the League of Assassins, and his own former superior, Barney Ling. On several missions, Richard worked together with his friends Bronze Tiger and Lady Shiva.

After the character's title was cancelled, the character was a [[supporting character]] in the [[1980s]] series, ''[[The Question]]''.  He trained the title character both in martial arts and in [[eastern philosophy]]. He would also go on to train both [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] (in the art of stick-fighting) and [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]].

In [[2004]], the character's title was revived by [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[ Scott McDaniel]] as well as the character revamped, but only to be cancelled after twelve issues.
