'''Liberty Belle''' is the name of two fictional [[superheroes]].

==DC Comics==

The first Liberty Belle was '''Libby Lawrence-Chambers''', whose [[World War Two|wartime]] adventures were published in [[DC Comics|DC's]]' ''[[All-Star Squadron]]''. Her powers of enhanced speed, strength, and stamina were linked to the ringing of the [[Liberty Bell]] in [[Philadelphia]]; thus, she had an assistant in that city who would, when signaled, ring the bell for her.

After the war, she married speedster [[Johnny Quick]]. They had a daughter who shared both their powers, who took the codename [[Jesse Quick]].

In [[2000]], Liberty Belle was referenced in an episode of [[Powerpuff Girls]], when the character Blossom adopted the name as an [[alias]] after reading a comic book about a superheroine similar to [[Wonder Woman]] named ''Freedom Gal''. This wasn't necessarily a conscious reference to the pre-existing comics character.

==Charlton Comics==

A backup feature in [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]]'s ''[[E-Man]]'' #5 (Nov. [[1974]]), '''Caroline Dean''' was a red-white-and-blue heroine who helped out on an American rocket launch. [[Joe Gill]] scripted, with industry legend [[Steve Ditko]] supplying the art.
