'''Liberty Belle''' is the name of three fictional [[superhero|superheroines]].

==DC Comics==
===Libby Lawrence===
The first Liberty Belle was '''Libby Lawrence-Chambers'''. Her powers of enhanced speed, strength, and stamina were linked to the ringing of the [[Liberty Bell]] in [[Philadelphia]]; thus, she had an assistant in that city who would, when signaled, ring the bell for her.

Most of Liberty Belle's heroic exploits took place during the Second World War, and she was one of the founding members (and later chairwoman) of the [[All-Star Squadron]]. In her secret identity, she was famous radio columnist Libby Lawrence, and was therefore both well-known in and out of costume. After the war, she married speedster [[Johnny Quick]]. They had a daughter, Jesse, who shared both their powers and took the codename [[Jesse Quick]].

At some point, Libby and Johnny separated, and she became extremely bitter about the whole costume-adventurer business. She repeatedly attempted to talk her daughter out of it, most notably at Johnny Quick's funeral.

In ''[[JSA]]'' #81, following the destruction of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]], Belle felt an increased need for power and attempted to increase her power levels by repeatedly ringing the Liberty Bell. For unknown reasons this did not work, and Belle was trapped on the bell, which was producing massive damage via sonic waves. She was saved by [[Stargirl]]. It is unclear how her powers were affected.

Liberty Belle is the descendant of the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary]] heroine Bess Lynn Lawrence, known as [[Miss Liberty (comics)|Miss Liberty]].

===Jesse Chambers===
:{{main|Jesse Chambers}}
The ''Justice Society of America'' comic book, released in December 2006, includes a new Liberty Belle, the heroine formerly known as '''Jesse Quick'''.

==Charlton Comics==
A backup feature in [[Charlton Comics|Charlton]]'s ''[[E-Man]]'' #5 (Nov. [[1974]]), '''Caroline Dean''', the second Liberty Belle, was a red-white-and-blue heroine who helped out on an American rocket launch. [[Joe Gill]] scripted, with industry legend [[Steve Ditko]] supplying the art.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] title ''[[Super-Soldier|Super Soldier: Man of War]]'' #1, Liberty Belle and [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] are merged together as '''[[American Belle]]'''.

==Other media==
In [[2000]], Liberty Belle was referenced in an episode of [[Powerpuff Girls]], when the character Blossom adopted the name as an [[pseudonym|alias]] after reading a comic book about a superheroine similar to [[Wonder Woman]] named ''Freedom Gal''. This wasn't necessarily a conscious reference to the pre-existing comics character.
