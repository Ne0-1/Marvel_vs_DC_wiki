'''Dark Beast''' ('''Henry Philip McCoy''') is a [[fictional character]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. He is the version of the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] from the alternate timeline of the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. 

==Character biography==
In the alternate dimension he came from, the Dark Beast was a [[mad scientist]] working for [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]], intent on breeding more powerful mutants according to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] "[[survival of the fittest]]" [[dogma]]. The Dark Beast delighted in causing pain to his lab subjects and in the cruelty of his experiments.

With the end of the Age of Apocalypse, the Dark Beast was able to escape into [[Earth 616]] through the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. The transition landed him twenty years in the past. At this point, the writers wrote a [[retcon]] and made the Dark Beast responsible for the creation of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].

The Dark Beast later [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] the real Beast and kept him a prisoner. He infiltrated the [[X-Men]] in his place up until the [[Onslaught Saga]], during which the Dark Beast joined [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. 

Currently the Dark Beast is in [[Genosha]] where he joined Xavier's team after being offered [[parole]], though he may have his own agenda.

It should be noted that Dark Beast always has a fiendish previous version of Beast's look.
Originally, he was grey (just like 616 - Beast was for a while), before he mutated himself to have Beast's blue simian look. Now, Beast has gained a feline look, while Dark Beast retains his blue simian look.

==Powers and abilities==
The Dark Beast has the same [[superhuman]] abilities and intelligence as the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. However, he is not physically as strong as his counterpart in the normal Marvel continuity.

==Appearances in other media==
In the [[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]] video game, Dark beast appears as a brainwashed beast, believing himself to be a follower of Mr.Sinister and Apocalypse. He battles the player as a boss along with Mr.Sinister.
