'''Dark Beast''' ('''Henry Philip McCoy'''), sometimes known as the '''Black Beast''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate reality]] [[evil twin|evil]] [[doppelgänger|version]] of the [[X-Men]]’s [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Roger Cruz]], he first appeared in ''X-Men: Alpha'' (1995).

In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, McCoy was a [[mad scientist|nefarious geneticist]] who implemented cruel experiments under the tyrant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. He was one of a handful of characters to escape the Age of Apocalypse reality to [[Earth-616|the regular Marvel Universe]], where he has continued his unethical experiments.

==Fictional character biography==
In the alternate dimension he came from, Hank McCoy was a [[mad scientist]] working for [[Mister Sinister]] in his breeding pens, intent on breeding more powerful mutants according to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] "[[survival of the fittest]]" [[dogma]]. However, while Sinister was methodical and rational in his experiments, McCoy, as ruthless as his mentor, sadistically delighted in causing pain to his lab subjects and in the cruelty of his experiments, which is why he was nicknamed the Beast both by prisoners and Sinister's Elite Mutant Force. McCoy also experimented on himself in order to further his mutation, and gained his ape-like bestial appearance. Any mutant that he deemed unworthy was turned into a component of a genetic stew that was used to create Apocalypse's army of Infinites.

Besides being one of the creators of the Infinites, the Dark Beast also experimented on [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], on [[Jamie Madrox]] (thus being one of the creators of The Madri), merged all of the [[Power Pack|Power siblings]] into one hideous creature, made Nemesis into [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] following his defeat at the hands of Magneto, and was also responsible for the creation of Holocaust's lead hunter Wolverine (not to be confused with the [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] of the X-Men, who was known only as Weapon X in that reality).

With the end of the Age of Apocalypse, the Dark Beast was able to escape into [[Earth-616]] through the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. He was believed to have died due to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver's]] interference in his set trajectory. However, the only damage was that he landed twenty years in the past in the Morlock Tunnels. Upon his arrival he was met by a young [[Emma Frost]], who helped him to regain some of his scattered memories.<ref>''Generation X #-1''</ref> The Dark Beast was responsible for the creation of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. The characteristics of the experimentation was later recognized by the 616 Mister Sinister as an unauthorized use of his own theories, leading him to order the [[Mutant Massacre|elimination]] of the Morlocks.

The Dark Beast later [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] the real Beast and kept him a prisoner behind a brick wall. He infiltrated the [[X-Men]] in his place by altering his appearance to match the real McCoy's fur color. He helped keep up the ruse by slaying many of Hank's childhood friends and teachers, although he found himself unable to kill Hank's parents. Angered at this emotional weakness, he decapitated a pedestrian as he left town. The Dark Beast was able to keep up his ruse until the [[Onslaught (comics)#The Onslaught Saga|Onslaught Saga]], during which the Dark Beast joined [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. 

He also had a few run-ins with [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and [[Gene Nation]].<ref>''Generation X'' #6</ref><ref>''X-Man'' #50</ref><ref>''Generation X'' #50</ref> There he was the leader of the newly revamped Gene Nation, although through the robotic body of Wynter, attempting to capture Generation X in order to experiment on them. The previous meeting between him and Emma Frost was also revealed. He also led an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].

Right before ''[[House of M]]'', the Dark Beast was in [[Genosha]] where he joined Xavier's team after being offered [[parole]]. It was confirmed in The 198 Files one-shot that he stayed powered after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

Dark Beast returns and finally confronts his counterpart in the [[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]] storyline where he ambushes him in [[Neverland (comics)|Neverland]], the extermination camp ran by [[Weapon X]], to offer his services regarding finding a cure for M-Day. The two form an uneasy alliance to tackle the impending mutant extinction but part ways due to their drastically different moral approaches to science.<ref>{{cite news|author=Richard George|title=Endangered X-Men Build to Fall Event|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2007-03-18|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/773/773652p1.html|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref> During a trip to the Guthrie household aimed at requesting samples of DNA from the mother and father of several mutant, and non-mutant, children - the Dark Beast (without warning Henry) poisons one of the un-mutated Guthrie boys in a quick scientific experiment. He then carries the dying boy's body back to the house, suggesting that they should try one of the girls next. Shocked and enraged with his actions, Hank attacks the Dark Beast who, disgusted with Henry's inability to do all that is necessary to save their mutant species, beats him almost unconscious. The fight is interrupted by Mrs. Guthrie, who fires a round from a double-barrled shotgun into Dark Beast's left shoulder. After scolding Mrs. Guthrie for thinking a round of birdshot would put him down, the Dark Beast is knocked unconscious by Henry.

==Powers and abilities==
The Dark Beast has the same [[superhuman]] abilities and intelligence as the [[Earth-616|main Marvel Universe's]] [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before he underwent his recent cat-like mutation. However, Dark Beast was not physically as powerful as his counterpart was in the normal Marvel continuity as he did not train on a regular basis and he is 20 years older than the main universe's Beast. There are parallels between Dark Beast and Apocalypse's relationship and Roger and Jack's from the [[Lord of the Flies]]

While as intelligent as his counter-part, "normal" Beast seems to possess a larger spectrum of knowledge, as evidenced when Dark Beast was infiltrating the X-Men, he became annoyed at the amount of knowledge the X-Men expected him to possess. This is due to Dark Beast specialising in genetics, while 616 Beast maintained study in multiple fields.

==Alternate Continuities== 
An alternate Dark Beast is seen in the ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]'' storyline alongside [[Alternate versions of Beast#Mutant X|Brute]] of the ''[[Mutant X]]'' reality.

==Other Media==
===Video games===
In the ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' video game, Dark Beast appears as a brainwashed Beast who believes himself to be a follower of Mister Sinister and Apocalypse. He battles the player as a boss along with Mr. Sinister. The cause of Beast's actions was the drugs created by Sinister. After being cured, Beast begins to feel guilty for his actions. Dark Beast has special dialogue with Storm.
