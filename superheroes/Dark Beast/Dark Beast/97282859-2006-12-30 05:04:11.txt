'''Dark Beast (Henry Philip McCoy''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an evil, [[alternate reality]] version of the [[X-Men]]’s [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Roger Cruz]], he first appeared in ''X-Men: Alpha'' (1995).

In the “[[Age of Apocalypse]]” reality, McCoy was a [[mad scientist|nefarious geneticist]] who implemented cruel experiments under tyrant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. He was one of a handful of characters to escape the Age of Apocalypse reality to [[Earth 616|the regular Marvel universe]], where he has continued his unethical experiments. Of that handful, he is the last one still alive.

==Fictional character biography==
In the alternate dimension he came from, Hank McCoy was a [[mad scientist]] working for [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]] in his '''breeding pens''', intent on breeding more powerful mutants according to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] "[[survival of the fittest]]" [[dogma]]. While Sinister was methodical and rational in his experiments, McCoy, ruthless as his mentor, delighted in causing pain to his lab subjects and in the cruelty of his experiments, which is why he was nicknamed the Beast both by prisoners and Sinister's Elite Mutant Force. McCoy also experimented on himself in order to further his mutation, and gained his ape-like feral appearance. Any mutant that he deemed unworthy was turned into a genetic stew that was used to create Apocalypse's army of '''Infinites'''.

Besides being one of the creators of the Infinites, the Dark Beast also experimented on [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], on [[Multiple Man|Jamie Madrox]] (thus being one of the creators of The Madri), merged all of the [[Power Pack|Power siblings]] into one hideous creature, made Nemesis into [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] following his defeat at the hands of Magneto and was also responsible for the creation of Holocaust's lead hunter Wolverine (not to be confused with the [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] of the X-Men, who was known only as '''Weapon X''' in that reality).

With the end of the Age of Apocalypse, the Dark Beast was able to escape into [[Earth 616]] through the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. He was believed to have died due to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver's]] interference in his set trajectory. However, the only damage was that he landed twenty years in the past in the Morlock Tunnels. Upon his arrival he was met by a young [[Emma Frost]], who helped him to regain some of his scattered memories (shown in ''Generation X minus 1''). At this point, the writers wrote a [[retcon]] and made the Dark Beast responsible for the creation of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].

The Dark Beast later [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] the real Beast and kept him a prisoner. He infiltrated the [[X-Men]] in his place by genetically altering his appearance to have the real McCoy's fur color and texture. He was able to keep up his ruse  until the [[Onslaught Saga]], during which the Dark Beast joined [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. 

He also had a few run-ins with [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and [[Gene Nation]], first behind the scenes in ''Generation X'' #6 and then in the crossover of ''X-Man'' #50 and ''Generation X'' #50. There he made a [[cameo]] as the leader of the newly revamped Gene Nation (although through the robotic body of '''Wynter'''), attempting to capture Generation X in order to experiment on them. He led an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] was said to have created the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]

Right before [[House of M]], the Dark Beast was in [[Genosha]] where he joined Xavier's team after being offered [[parole]], though he may have had his own agenda. It was confirmed in The 198 Files one-shot that he stayed powered after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

It should be noted that Dark Beast always has a fiendish previous version of Beast's look. Originally, he was grey (just like 616 - Beast was for a while), before he mutated himself to have Beast's blue [[simian]] look. Now, Beast has gained a feline look, while Dark Beast retains his blue simian look, but in a shade of dark blue closer to [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler's]] hue.

==Powers and abilities==
The Dark Beast has the same [[superhuman]] abilities and intelligence as the [[Earth-616|main Marvel Universe's]] [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before he underwent his recent cat-like mutation. However, Dark Beast was not physically as strong as his counterpart was in the normal Marvel continuity due to the fact he did not train on a regular basis.

While as intelligent as his counter-part, "normal" Beast seems to possess a larger spectrum of knowledge, as evidenced when Dark Beast was infiltrating the X-Men, he became annoyed at the amount of knowledge the X-Men expected him to possess. This is due to Dark Beast specalising in genetics, while 616 Beast maintained study in multiple fields.

==Appearances in other media==
===Video games===
In the ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' video game, Dark Beast appears as a brainwashed Beast, believing himself to be a follower of Mr. Sinister and Apocalypse. He battles the player as a boss along with Mr. Sinister.  The cause of Beast's actions was the drugs created by Sinister.  After being cured, Beast begins to feel guilty for his actions.
