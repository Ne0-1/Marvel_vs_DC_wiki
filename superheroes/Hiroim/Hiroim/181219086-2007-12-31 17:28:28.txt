'''Hiroim''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic-book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He [[first appeared]] in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 3, #92. 

==Fictional character biography==
Originally, Hiroim was a Shadow Priest, dedicated to the story of the Sakaarson- he who would unite the people of Sakaar- and trained to join the other Shadows. However, for his blasphemy of daring to dream that ''he'' could be the Sakaarson, he was expelled from the order and ended up in the Mepire's gladiator training school, the Maw, where he fought alongisde such other warriors as [[Miek]], [[No-Name]] the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] Queen, [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. After two victories in the arena- during which their teammate Lavin Skee was badly injured-, having heard the stories of his allies, Hiroim formed a [[Warbound]] pact with them, vowing that they would always stand together. Having been freed from their obedience disks by the [[Silver Surfer]], the Warbound went on to vanquish the Red King, Hiroim concluding that the Hulk was the true Sakaarson (Although he briefly thought that the Surfer might be the Sakaarson). 

With the destruction of Sakaar following the detonation of the shuttle that brought the Hulk to Earth, Hiroim having absorbed the powers of all the Sakaar Shadow Priests as he was the only one left accompanied the Hulk to Earth to wage war against the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]]. During the subsequent conflict with Earth's heroes, Hiroim defeated [[Spider-Man]] and [[Luke Cage]] during the Warbound's initial attack, but was apparently defeated by [[Doctor Strange]] when the sorcerer called on the power of his old enemy [[Zom]].

Following the revelation of Miek's treachery that it had been him who triggered the destruction of Sakaar, the remaining Warbound surrendered to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but managed to escape during tremors caused by Manhattan Island breaking up due to the damage the Hulk had caused. Channeling the rock-based powers of his fellow Warbound [[Korg (comics)|Korg]], as well as Earth hero the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], Hiroim was able to 'heal' the damage before he and the others departed, escaping into the sewers.

Embued with the power of the [[Zom]] entity, the sorcerer supreme shattered Hiroim's left arm.

==Power and abilities==
Like all the shadow people, Hiroim at his base possesses physical traits slightly superior to the human maximum, and ages more slowly after reaching adulthood at the age of 13. Beyond this he has received quasi-mystic training as a shadow priest, and is an experienced warrior, strategist, and philosopher. After the deaths of [[Caiera]] and his people he inherited the stone-based "oldstrong power", drawing power from the planet itself, enabling him to turn his body into immensely hard and strong 'mystic rock'. Further demonstrated talents include sensing and unravelling powerful mystic wards cast by [[Doctor Strange]], and limited control over the earth, when helping to keep a massive chasm from destroying [[Manhattan Island]].
