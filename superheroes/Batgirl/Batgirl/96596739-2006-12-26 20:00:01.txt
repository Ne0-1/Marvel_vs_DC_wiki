'''Batgirl''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], a female crime-fighter modeled after and associated with [[Batman]].

Although a lesser-known '''Bat-Girl''' appeared in early [[1960s]] Batman [[comic book]]s, the best-known Batgirl was '''[[Barbara Gordon]]''', daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. She was a collaboration between DC editors and the producers of the [[Batman (TV series)|Batman television series]] and debuted in both mediums in 1967. This version of Batgirl played a large role in the final season of the series and was featured, less prominently, in most subsequent other media adaptations of Batman. She was also featured regularly in Batman-related comics.

However, in the classic 1988 [[one shot]] ''[[The Killing Joke]]'', [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] shot her in the spine, leaving her [[paraplegic]]; she later reinvented herself as Oracle, the premiere [[information broker]] of the DC’s superhero community. 

In 1998, the Batgirl mantle was taken up by Helena Bertinelli, who is best known as The Huntress. The stories of her as Batgirl are confined to the events of the long-running "No Man's Land" storyline. Batman stripped away the Batgirl mantle from Helena near the end of that story.

In 1999, the [[martial arts]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] '''[[Cassandra Cain]]''' became the third in-continuity Batgirl, under the tutelage of Batman and Oracle, and was given Helena's Batgirl costume. She was the first Batgirl to star in an [[eponym]]ous monthly series, which was cancelled in 2006. In the final story, Cain gave up the Batgirl title and moved away from the [[Batman Family]].  Since then she has become a villain who now leads the League of Assassins.

Bat-Girl was '''Betty Kane''' (first appearance: ''Batman'' #139, 1961), the niece of Kathy Kane, [[Batwoman]]. Batwoman and Bat-Girl were created to be romantic interests for [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] as much as crime-fighting associates. Bat-Girl wore a red-and-green costume to "flatter" Robin. Bat-Girl appeared seven times between 1961 and 1964, but then disappeared in 1964 (along with Batwoman, [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]]) when new Batman editor [[Julius Schwartz]] decided these characters were too silly.

Batwoman and Bat-Girl were revived in the late [[1970s]]. Bat-Girl became a member of '''Teen Titans West'''. However, she only appeared a total of four times in this era.

Bat-Girl was [[retcon]]ned out of existence following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].  However, even though Bat-Girl never existed in Post-Crisis continuity, a superheroine named [[Flamebird]] was introduced who had many similarites to Bat-Girl in her costume, her interest in tennis, her history with Titans West, and her romantic connection to Robin. Flamebird's real name is similar to the first Bat-Girl's: '''Mary Elizabeth 'Bette' Kane'''.

In [[Infinite Crisis]], it was implied that Flamebird originated from Earth-Two and was Bat-Girl's Earth-Two counterpart. According to the new continuity, the Earth-Two Flamebird replaced the Earth-One Bat-Girl during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

==Barbara Gordon==
{{main|Barbara Gordon}}

The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Batgirl was [[librarian]]-by-day '''Barbara Gordon''' (first appearance: ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, 1967), daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. On her way to a masquerade ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara (also known as Babs) halted a kidnapping attempt on [[Bruce Wayne]] by the villainous [[Killer Moth]], attracting the attention of Batman and leading to a crime-fighting career. (The most recent version of Batgirl's origin can be found in the Batgirl: Year One trade paperback, published in 2004.)

At first, Batman did not approve of Barbara's involvement in crime-fighting, but as she solved more cases, beat more villains, and became more skilled, Batgirl gained Batman's respect and trust. Barbara Gordon appeared as Batgirl from 1967 to 1988, but she is frequently featured as Batgirl in "flashback" stories.

After reliquishing her role as Batgirl, Barbara Gordon was later shot in the spine and crippled by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. She continued to fight crime, even though she was wheelchair bound, under the guise of [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]], a free-lance information broker and expert hacker who has supported a number of different heroes, but most notably as the founder of and brains behind the [[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]].

In 2007, DC Comics will publish "All-Star Batgirl," which will be the first ongoing series to star Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. DC's "All-Star" stories take place outside standard DC continuity and feature the iconic versions of popular DC heroes.

==Helena Bertinelli==
{{main|Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)}}

During the late 1990s [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]] [[story arc]], a new Batgirl emerged.  She was revealed to be the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], '''Helena Bertinelli'''. 

An [[earthquake]] had leveled [[Gotham City]], the government declared the city a [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]] and Batman disappeared. To bring order to the city, the Huntress assumed the mantle of The Bat (she discovered criminals feared her more than they did when she was the Huntress). When Batman returned, he said if she failed him she would have to give up the costume. 

When Huntress failed to protect Batman's territory from [[Two-Face]] and his gang of over 200 criminals  on her own (while Batman himself was unconscious and tied up), he held her responsible and stripped her of the mantle.

Huntress would later join Oracle's [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]], thus giving the group ''two'' former Batgirls.

==Cassandra Cain==
{{main|Cassandra Cain}}

'''Cassandra Cain''', nicknamed "Cassie,", was a young woman of partly [[Asian]] descent who became the third Batgirl with the approval of both [[Batman]] and [[Barbara Gordon]]. She was given Helena Bertinelli's costume. Trained by her father, [[assassin]] [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], to be the ultimate [[martial artist]] and assassin, Cassandra was not taught to speak. Instead, the parts of her brain normally used for speech were trained so she could read other people's movements and body language and predict, with uncanny accuracy, their next move. This ability lives up to her namesake; Cassandra in Greek mythology had the gift of seeing into the future, but was cursed so that nobody would ever believe her predictions. This closely relates to Cassandra's capability of 'seeing' her opponents next move at the cost of being (initially) unable to speak. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, a form of dyslexia that hampers her ability to read and write. She eventually gave up the identity, with her solo series cancelled (''Batgirl'' #73).

{{spoiler-solicitation}}

Cassandra is scheduled to reprise her role as Batgirl in the upcoming [[Titans East]] storyline of ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]''. She is also slated to appear in ''[[Supergirl]]'' #14, where she will fight the title character.

==One Year Later: The "Birds of Prey" Batgirl==
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:misfit.png|left|thumb|A "new Batgirl". Art by James Raiz.]]
In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #96, a couple is saved from muggers by a woman wearing what appears to be Barbara Gordon's classic Batgirl costume. She dispatches one of the robbers with a Batarang, and the others with well-placed punches. The male of the rescued couple says "Batgirl is back!"

In issue #98, [[Black Canary]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] are sent to find the new Batgirl. They have [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] fake being attacked, and lure the new Batgirl out of hiding. They are startled when Batgirl appears, a young girl in a homemade costume and using various catch phrases such as "Dark Vengeance". However, she calls Huntress by her real name, and seems to have metahuman powers, such as [[teleportation]], superhuman strength, and rapid healing abilities. She saves Huntress from an assassin and teleports away, only to re-appear behind Oracle in the headquarters, saying, "We have got to spend more time together, Babs."

In issue #99, Oracle and the new Batgirl (who apparently also has cloaking abilities) fight, and Oracle persuades the girl to stop wearing the Batgirl costume. The girl tells Oracle she will give up being Batgirl but adds that she will not give up being a superhero. In issue #101, she reappears in Oracle's headquarters, wearing a new, if similar, costume, and calls herself '''Misfit'''.

==All-Star Batgirl==

Wizard Entertainment announced that Geoff Johns will team with J.G. Jones in an All-Star Batgirl series.  In his interview to Wizard, Johns on the series says, "We’re doing the first six issues, the first of which will hit in late 2007 well after J.G. and I are done with 52, so it’s monthly. It’s a mystery revolving around Barbara Gordon and Arkham Asylum, why she’s become Batgirl and more importantly why she remains Batgirl. It’s essentially our Batman: Long Halloween or Superman: For All Seasons for Batgirl."

==Batgirl in other media==
===Television===
The Barbara Gordon Batgirl appeared in the final season of the live-action ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series in 1967, the same year as her comic-book debut. In fact, she was created in cooperation with the show's producers, who wanted a female character who could be added to the show's regular cast.

Some uncertainty exists over who developed what aspects of the character, with one often cited (although almost certainly incorrect) version claiming that [[DC Comics]] simply took the idea wholesale from the TV show. However [[Julius Schwartz]], editor of the Batman [[comic book]] at the time, apparently claimed that he instigated Batgirl as a way of transferring some of the large female demographic of the TV show over to the comic. When the TV producers saw rough "concept" artwork by artist [[Carmine Infantino]] during a visit to [[DC Comics]] offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to a skeptical [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network.

[[Image:Yvonne Craig Batgirl.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yvonne Craig]] as Batgirl.]]

'''Note''': Batman series producers [[Bill Dozier]] and [[Howie Horowitz]] have variously claimed credit for aspects of Batman (for example the characters of Alfred the Butler and Aunt Harriet) which they clearly borrowed from elsewhere. It's unlikely that this is a deliberate attempt to mislead, merely a result of faulty memories coupled with loose story telling. With this in mind, and recalling that the show's own credits claim Batgirl as being the property of [[DC Comics]], Schwartz's account is likely to be closer to the truth.

In the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, Batgirl was played by [[Yvonne Craig]]. A seven minute pilot reel was created to try out the new character. The reel starts in the [[Gotham]] City Library, where librarian Barbara Gordon is dealing with [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Dick Grayson]]. The Killer Moth and his henchmen attack the library, locking Barbara in an office.  Bruce and Dick leave, to return as Batman and Robin, while Barbara opens a [[secret passage|secret door]] to reveal her Batgirl closet, and transforms her dowdy librarian attire into a Batgirl costume (the skirt becomes a cape, etc). This "transformation," borrowed from the [[comic book]], was dropped in the series proper as it meant Barbara would always wear the same outfit.

It has been suggested that the original intent of this pilot reel was to sell Batgirl in her own half hour show, early in the evening, while the Batman show would screen later that night to conclude the storyline. At the end of the reel, there is indeed a brief Batgirl theme tune and a caption featuring a Batgirl logo. However, given the mediocre ratings of the previous Batman season, the notion that the reel was to pitch a spin-off show seems unlikely.  

The TV Batgirl was not allowed the fighting skills displayed by her [[comic book]] counterpart. She was permitted only to kick and throw objects at criminals, often facilitating an easy capture. Television networks at the time generally did not show women in realistic combat situations (indeed possibly the first US small screen fist fight involving a woman was penned by Batman script writer [[Stanley Ralph Ross]], for the [[1975]] [[Lynda Carter]] '[[Wonder Woman]]' pilot movie). In the 27 episodes in which Batgirl appeared, she never captured the crooks all on her own, although she rescued the Dynamic Duo at least once.

This watered-down version of the character did little to help the show's ratings and one is left to wonder how a more 'empowered' version of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl would have fared with television audiences. 

The short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series (2002) featured a paralyzed Barbara Gordon ([[Dina Meyer]]) donning her Batgirl costume both in flashback sequences and in the present, thanks to a device that allows her to walk. Although based loosely upon the continuity established by ''The Killing Joke'', elements of the Cassandra Cain Batgirl were also incorporated as one episode saw Gordon/Batgirl fighting [[Lady Shiva]], Cain's nemesis/mother.

===Cartoons===
Batgirl made her first animated appearance in [[1968 in televison|1968]], turning up in a handful of episodes of the animated  [[Filmation]] series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' and voiced by [[Jane Webb]]. The character was voiced by [[Melendy Britt]] in the [[1977 in television|1977]] animated series entitled ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.  Between these two appearances, Craig reprised her role for a [[1972]] live action TV commercial promoting equal pay for women.

More recently, Barbara Gordon was a recurring character in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]], and later in the follow-up series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', by [[Tara Strong]]. In the animated series, she originally adopted the Batgirl identity to help her father when he was framed by [[Two-Face]]. She also appeared in the direct-to-video B:TAS features ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]]) and ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' again voiced by Tara Strong. Additionally, Strong voiced the character in the [[Flash-animation]] Web series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', in which Batgirl appears opposite [[Catwoman]], [[Poison Ivy]], and [[Harley Quinn]].

A more elderly version of the character, voiced by [[Stockard Channing]], appeared in the futuristic spin-off, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. Here she had given up on ("grown out of", she insisted) costumed crime-fighting and followed her father into the police force, eventually becoming the Gotham Police Commissioner herself. It is alluded to that she and Bruce Wayne had an intimate relationship, after she ended her disastrous tryst with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]. The animated series contained no version of ''The Killing Joke'', so Barbara Gordon kept the use of her legs and there is no evidence she ever became Oracle. Barbara makes a claim that she was shot during her stint as Batgirl in Batman Beyond S1E12, "A Touch of Curare", which causes her role of Oracle to be a possibility. This character also appeared in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', where she was voiced by [[Angie Harmon]] instead of Stockard Channing.

In the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode ''The Savage Time'', the alternate Batman leads a resistance movement against Vandal Savage. Among the members of his resistance are Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon, and Tim Drake. According to the series' creators, a girl seen playing with Drake was Cassandra Cain in a cameo appearance.  

A young Barbara Gordon assumed the role of Batgirl in the third Season of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Danielle Judovits]]. In that series, Barbara was close friends with the teenaged eco-terrorist Pamela Isley, who became transformed into [[Poison Ivy]] in the same two-part special that introduced Batgirl. The two referred to each other as Red, a nod towards [[Harley Quinn]]'s nickname for [[Poison Ivy]]. Batgirl continued to make appearances throughout the Season, trying to help out Batman. Later in Season Four's "Team Penguin," Batman finally accepted Batgirl as a trusted ally and revealed his secret idendity to her.

===Movies===
The [[1997 in film|1997]] movie ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 film)|Batman and Robin]]'' included a new Batgirl: Barbara Wilson, played by [[Alicia Silverstone]]. She was the niece of Bruce Wayne's [[butler (servant)|butler]], [[Alfred (comics)|Alfred Pennyworth]]. This Batgirl was similar in many ways to Barbara Gordon, but James Gordon's relatively small role in the films contributed to the differences.
