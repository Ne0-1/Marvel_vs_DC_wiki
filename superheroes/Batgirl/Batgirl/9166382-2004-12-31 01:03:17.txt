'''Batgirl''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], a female crime-fighter modeled after and associated with [[Batman]].

The most well known Batgirl is '''Barbara Gordon''', the daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (Batman)|James Gordon]]. Introduced in the [[1960s]] [[Batman (1960s TV series)|Batman television series]] and soon added to the [[comic book]] [[continuity]], the Barbara Gordon Batgirl often appears in adaptations of the Batman [[mythos]] in other media.

''Batgirl'' is also the title of the monthly comic book series starring the current Batgirl, '''Cassandra Cain'''. The comic features Barbara Gordon as Cain's mentor.

===Betty Kane===

Bat-Girl was Betty Kane (first appearance: ''Batman'' #139, [[1961]]), the niece of [[Batwoman]], [[Kathy Kane]]. Batwoman and Bat-Girl were created to be romantic interests for [[Batman]] and [[Robin (Batman)|Robin]] as much as crime-fighting associates (possibly in response to [[Fredric Wertham]]'s allegations about the true nature of the Dynamic Duo's relationship), but the characters never gained a following. Bat-Girl, like Batwoman, was [[retcon]]ned out of existence following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

In Post-Crisis continuity Betty Kane still exists. She however is not Bat-Girl but a professional [[tennis]] player not related to Batman who is also the superhero [[Flamebird]]. She was a sometime member of the [[Teen Titans]] and like the old Bat-Girl she has a crush on Robin.

===Barbara Gordon===
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Batgirl was [[librarian]]-by-day Barbara Gordon (first appearance: ''Detective Comics'' #359, [[1967]]), daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (Batman)|James Gordon]]. On her way to a masquerade ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara intervened in a kidnapping attempt on [[Bruce Wayne]], attracting the attention of Batman and leading to a crime-fighting career. She continued to be Batgirl before she semi-retired in the [[1980s]]. Barbara Gordon was, and still is, a love interest for [[Dick Grayson]], the original [[Robin (Batman)|Robin]], currently known as [[Nightwing]].

In ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]],'' a graphic novel by [[Alan Moore]], [[The Joker]] shot Barbara through the spine, paralyzing her. Now [[wheelchair]]-bound, Barbara adopted the code-name [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]], and she is an computer expert, providing informational, tactical, and security assistance to many superheroes, including Batman and the [[Justice League|JLA]].  Barbara is the leader of the all-female superhero team ''[[Birds of Prey]]''.

(Unlike Bat-Girl Betty Kane, Barbara Gordon made it through [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] mostly intact, although her relationship with James Gordon was [[retcon]]ned to niece-and-adopted-daughter after [[Frank Miller]] <!--accidentally?--> depicted him as having only fathered a son in ''[[Batman: Year One]]''.)

===Helena Bertinelli===
During the late [[1990s]] ''No Man's Land'' [[story arc]], a new Batgirl emerged. She was revealed to be the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], Helena Bertinelli. She resumed being the Huntress, soon after, as both Batman and Barbara Gordon were displeased with her methods.

===Cassandra Cain===
Cassandra Cain is the current Batgirl, having taken on the role with the approval of both Batman and Barbara Gordon. Trained by her father, [[assassin]] [[David Cain]], to be the ultimate [[martial artist]] and assassin, Cassandra was not taught to speak.  Instead, the parts of her brain normally used for speech were trained so she could  read other people's movements and body language and predict, with uncanny accuracy, their next move. Although she has sinced learned to speak, Cassandra is still a gifted martial artist who managed to defeat [[Lady Shiva]], the deadliest fighter of [[DC Universe]]. In [[2000]], Cassandra became the first Batgirl to get her own ongoing self-titled comic book series (the Gordon Batgirl having been featured in a couple of one-shot releases).

==Batgirl in other media==
The Barbara Gordon Batgirl appeared in the final season of the live-action ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series in [[1967]], the same year as her comic-book debut. In fact, she had been created at the request of the show's producers, who wanted a female character who could be added to the show's regular cast (some uncertainty exists about who invented the details of the character, however). In this series, she was played by [[Yvonne Craig]].

Barbara Gordon was also a recurring character in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]] and then by [[Tara Strong]]. In the animated series, she originally adopted the Batgirl identity to help her father when he was framed by [[Two-Face]].
An older version of the character, voiced by [[Stockard Channing]], appeared in the futuristic spin-off, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. Here she had given up on ("grown out of", she insisted) costumed crime-fighting and followed her father into the police force, eventually becoming Police Commissioner herself. (The animated series contained no version of ''The Killing Joke'', so Barbara Gordon kept the use of her legs and never became Oracle.)

The [[1997]] movie ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 movie)|Batman and Robin]]'' included a new Batgirl. Barbara Wilson, played by [[Alicia Silverstone]], was the niece of [[Bruce Wayne]]'s [[Domestic worker|butler]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. This Batgirl was similar in many ways to Barbara Gordon, but James Gordon's relatively small role in the films contributed to the differences.

The short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series ([[2002]]) featured a paralyzed Barbara Gordon ([[Dina Meyer]]) donning her Batgirl costume both in flashback sequences and in the present, thanks to a device that allows her to walk. Although based primarily upon the continuity established by ''The Killing Joke'' (though with modifications), elements of the Cassandra Cain Batgirl were also incorporated as one episode saw Gordon/Batgirl fighting Lady Shiva, Cain's nemesis.
