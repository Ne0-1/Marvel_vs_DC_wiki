'''Batgirl''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], a female crime-fighter modeled after and associated with [[Batman]].

Although a mostly-forgotten '''Bat-Girl''' appeared in Batman [[comic books]] of the early 1960s, the most well-known Batgirl was a collaboration between DC editors and the producers of the [[Batman (TV series)|Batman television series]] and debuted in both mediums in 1967.  She was '''[[Barbara Gordon]]''', the daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (Batman)|James Gordon]].

In 1988, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] shot Barbara Gordon in the spine, leaving her [[paraplegic]]; she later reinvented herself as the premiere information broker of the DC universe, [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]].

The current Batgirl, the [[martial arts]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] '''[[Cassandra Cain]]''', first appeared in 1999 and is the trainee of Oracle.  She currently stars in an [[eponym|eponymous]] monthly series.

Bat-Girl was '''Betty Kane''' (first appearance: ''Batman'' #139, 1961), the niece of [[Batwoman]], [[Kathy Kane]].  Batwoman and Bat-Girl were created to be romantic interests for [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] as much as crime-fighting associates (it has been suggested that this was partially in response to [[Fredric Wertham]]'s allegations about the [[homosexual]] nature of the [[Batman#Homosexual interpretations|Dynamic Duo's relationship]]).   Bat-Girl, like Batwoman, was [[retcon]]ned out of existence following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

In Post-Crisis continuity Betty Kane has been revived as '''Mary Elizabeth 'Bette' Kane''', a distinct heroine known as [[Flamebird]].

==Barbara Gordon==

The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Batgirl was [[librarian]]-by-day '''Barbara Gordon''' (first appearance: ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, 1967), daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]].  On her way to a masquerade ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara (also known as Babs) intervened in a kidnapping attempt on [[Bruce Wayne]] by the villainous [[Killer Moth]], attracting the attention of Batman and leading to a crime-fighting career. 

==Helena Bertinelli==

During the late 1990s [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]] [[story arc]], a new Batgirl emerged.  She was revealed to be the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], '''Helena Bertinelli'''. 

An [[earthquake]] had leveled [[Gotham City]], the government declared the city a [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]] and Batman disappeared.  To bring order to the city, the Huntress assumed the mantle of The Bat (she discovered criminals feared her more than they did when she was the Huntress). When Batman returned, he said if she failed him she would have to give up the costume. 

When Huntress, all by herself, failed to protect Batman's territory from [[Two-Face]] and his gang of over 200 criminals (while Batman himself was unconscious and tied up), he held her responsible and stripped her of the mantle.

==Cassandra Cain==
{{main|Cassandra Cain}}

'''Cassandra Cain''', nicknamed "Cass," is the current Batgirl (of [[Asian]] descent), having taken on the role with the approval of both Batman and Barbara Gordon.  Trained by her father, [[assassin]] [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], to be the ultimate [[martial artist]] and assassin, Cassandra was not taught to speak.  Instead, the parts of her brain normally used for speech were trained so she could read other people's movements and body language and predict, with uncanny accuracy, their next move.  This ability lives up to her namesake; Cassandra in Greek mythology had the gift of seeing into the future, but was cursed so that nobody would ever believe her predictions. This closely relates to Cassandra's capability of 'seeing' her opponents next move at the cost of being (initially) unable to speak. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different than most, a form of dyslexia that hampers her ability to read and write.(Batgirl #67)

*The Barbara Gordon Batgirl appeared in the final season of the live-action ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series in 1967, the same year as her comic-book debut. In fact, she was created in cooperation with the show's producers, who wanted a female character who could be added to the show's regular cast.

Some uncertainty exists over who developed what aspects of the character, with one often cited (although almost certainly incorrect) version claiming that [[DC Comics]] simply took the idea wholesale from the TV show.  However [[Julius Schwartz]], editor of the Batman [[comic book]] at the time, has apparently claimed that he instigated Batgirl as a way of transferring some of the large female demographic of the TV show over to the comic.  When the TV producers saw rough "concept" artwork by artist [[Carmine Infantino]] during a visit to [[DC Comics]] offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to a skeptical ABC television network.

'''Note''': Batman series producers [[Bill Dozier]] and [[Howie Horowitz]] have variously claimed credit for aspects of Batman (for example the characters of Alfred the Butler and Aunt Harriet) which they clearly borrowed from elsewhere.  It's unlikely that this is a deliberate attempt to mislead, merely a result of faulty memories coupled with loose story telling.  With this in mind, and recalling that the show's own credits claim Batgirl as being the property of [[DC Comics]], Schwartz's account is likely to be closer to the truth.

In the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, Batgirl was played by [[Yvonne Craig]]. A seven minute pilot reel was created to try out the new character. The reel starts in the Gotham City Library, where librarian Barbara Gordon is dealing with [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Dick Grayson]]. The Killer Moth and his henchmen attack the library, locking Barbara in an office.  Bruce and Dick leave, to return as Batman and Robin, while Barbara opens a secret door to reveal her Batgirl closet, and transforms her dowdy librarian attire into a Batgirl costume (the skirt becomes a cape, etc).  This "transformation," borrowed from the [[comic book]], was dropped in the series proper as it meant Barbara would always wear the same outfit.

It has been suggested that the original intent of this pilot reel was to sell Batgirl in her own half hour show, early in the evening, while the Batman show would screen later that night to conclude the storyline.  At the end of the reel, there is indeed a brief Batgirl theme tune and a caption featuring a Batgirl logo.  However, given the mediocre ratings of the previous Batman season, the notion that the reel was to pitch a spin-off show seems unlikely.  

The TV Batgirl was not allowed the fighting skills displayed by her [[comic book]] counterpart.  She was permitted only to kick and throw objects at criminals, often allowing for an easy capture.  Television networks at the time generally did now show women in realistic combat situations (indeed possibly the first US small screen fist fight involving a woman was penned by Batman script writer [[Stanley Ralph Ross]], for the 1975 [[Lynda Carter]] '[[Wonder Woman]]' pilot movie).  In the 27 episodes which Batgirl appeared, she never captured the crooks all on her own, although she rescued the Dynamic Duo at least once.

This watered down version of the character did little to help the show's ratings and one is left to wonder how a more 'empowered' version of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl would have fared with television audiences. 

*Batgirl also turned up in a handful of animated episodes of the  [[Filmation]] series ''The Batman/Superman Hour'' (1969), voiced by [[Jane Webb]], then later in the "sequel" series entitled ''The New Adventures of Batman'' (1977) voiced by [[Melendy Britt]].  Between these two appearances [[Yvonne Craig]] reprised her role for a 1972 live action TV commercial promoting equal pay for women.

*More recently Barbara Gordon has been a recurring character in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]] and then by [[Tara Strong]]. In the animated series, she originally adopted the Batgirl identity to help her father when he was framed by [[Two-Face]]. She also appeared in ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' (where she was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in her one and only role as Batgirl), ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', and ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]''; all of these are direct-to-video movies based on the series. She was also seen in ''[[The New Batman/Superman Adventures]]'' and voiced by the same actor.
**A more elderly version of the character, voiced by [[Stockard Channing]], appeared in the futuristic spin-off, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. Here she had given up on ("grown out of", she insisted) costumed crime-fighting and followed her father into the police force, eventually becoming Police Commissioner herself.  It is alluded to that she and Bruce Wayne had an intimate relationship.  The animated series contained no version of ''The Killing Joke'', so Barbara Gordon kept the use of her legs and never became Oracle.  This character also appeared in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', where she was voiced by [[Angie Harmon]] instead of Stockard Channing.
***In the [[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]] episode ''The Savage Time'', the alternate Batman leads a resistance movement against Vandal Savage. Among the members of his resistance are Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon, and Tim Drake.  According to the series' creators, a girl seen playing with Drake was Cassandra Cain in a cameo appearance.  

*The 1997 movie ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 film)|Batman and Robin]]'' included a new Batgirl. Barbara Wilson, played by [[Alicia Silverstone]], was the niece of [[Bruce Wayne]]'s [[butler (servant)|butler]], [[Alfred (comics)|Alfred Pennyworth]]. This Batgirl was similar in many ways to Barbara Gordon, but James Gordon's relatively small role in the films contributed to the differences. This version of the character is widely despised by fans, as it holds no similarity to the source material outside of the name "Batgirl".

*The short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series (2002) featured a paralyzed Barbara Gordon ([[Dina Meyer]]) donning her Batgirl costume both in flashback sequences and in the present, thanks to a device that allows her to walk. Although based loosely upon the continuity established by ''The Killing Joke'', elements of the Cassandra Cain Batgirl were also incorporated as one episode saw Gordon/Batgirl fighting Lady Shiva, Cain's nemesis.

*A young Barbara Gordon has assumed the role of Batgirl in recent episodes of [[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]].
