'''Batgirl''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]], in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. She has in all incarnations been an ally to [[Batman]], one of DC's most popular characters.

Although a lesser-known '''Bat-Girl'''( Bette Kane) appeared occasionally in the time between the late 1940s to the early 1960s, the best-known Batgirl was '''[[Barbara Gordon]]''', daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. After her debut in 1967,<ref>{{cite book |last= Fox |first= Gardner |authorlink= Gardner Fox |title= ''Detective Comics'' #359|year= 1967 |publisher= DC Comics}}</ref> she made regular appearances in Batman related comics from 1967-1988. However, in the [[One-shot (comics)|one shot]] ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'',<ref> {{cite book |last= Moore |first= Alan |authorlink= Alan Moore |title= Batman: The Killing Joke |year= 1988 |publisher= DC Comics|isbn= 978-0930289454}}</ref> [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] shot her in the spine, leaving her [[paraplegic]]. She later reinvented herself as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Ostander | first = John  | authorlink = John Ostander | title = Suicide Squad (Vol. 1) #23| publisher = DC Comics | date = 2007 | url = http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=8207 | isbn = 1401214916}}</ref> the premiere [[information broker]] of the superhero community and leader of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] team.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dixon | first = Chuck  | authorlink = Chuck Dixon | coauthors = Chuck Dixon, Jordan Gorfinkey | title = Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey | publisher = DC Comics | date = 1996 | isbn = 156389484X}}</ref> 

In 1998, the Batgirl mantle was taken up by '''[[Helena Bertinelli]]''', who is better known as [[Huntress (comics)|the Huntress]]. The stories of her as Batgirl are confined to the events of the long-running ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline. Batman stripped Helena of the mantle near the end of that story, leaving her to return to her Huntress identity.

In 1999, the [[martial arts]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] '''[[Cassandra Cain]]''' became the third Batgirl, under the tutelage of Batman and Oracle, and was given Helena's Batgirl costume. She was the first Batgirl to star in an [[eponym]]ous monthly series,<ref>{{cite book | last = Puckett | first = Kelley  | authorlink = Kelley Puckett | title = Batgirl, Vol 1: Silent Running | publisher = DC Comics | date = 2001 | isbn = 978-1563897054}}</ref> which was canceled in 2006, ending with Cain relinquishing her title as Batgirl. However, following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', she has taken back her former mantle, now as a villain rather than a heroine.

In 2006, '''[[Misfit (DC Comics)|Charlotte Gage-Radcliffe]]''' temporarily took the name of Batgirl,<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone |first= Gail |authorlink= Gail Simone |title= Birds of Prey #98 |year= 2006 |publisher= DC Comics}}</ref> but was forced to abandon the role by Oracle. Still determined to become a superhero, she then adopted the name "Misfit." 

==Character History==
===Betty Kane===
{{main|Bette Kane}}
[[Image:Batman139.JPG|thumb|180px|The first appearance of Bat-Girl, from ''Batman'' #139 (April 1961). Art by [[Sheldon Moldoff]].]]

The original '''Bat-Girl''' is '''Betty Kane'''<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Batman'' #139 |year= 1961 |publisher= DC Comics}}</ref>, niece of Kathy Kane — the vigilante known as [[Batwoman]]. Batwoman and Bat-Girl were created to be romantic interests for Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] as much as crime-fighting associates. Bat-Girl wore a red-and-green costume to "flatter" Robin. Bat-Girl appeared seven times between 1961 and 1964, but then disappeared in 1964 (along with Batwoman, [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]]) when new Batman editor [[Julius Schwartz]] decided these characters were too silly.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batwoman/BatwomanHistory.htm | title=Remembering Kathy Kane: The First Batwoman | author=Fred Grandinetti | publisher=Newsarama | accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref>

Batwoman and Bat-Girl were revived in the late [[1970s]]. Bat-Girl became a member of '''Teen Titans West'''. However, she only appeared a total of four times in this era.

Bat-Girl was [[retcon]]ned out of existence following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Wolfman| first= Marv| authorlink= Marv Wolfman| title= Crisis on Infinite Earths |year= 1985|publisher= DC Comics |isbn= 1-56389-750-4}}</ref> However, even though Bat-Girl did not exist in Post-Crisis continuity, a superheroine named [[Flamebird]] was introduced who had many similarities to Bat-Girl in her costume, her interest in tennis, her history with Titans West, and her romantic connection to Robin. Flamebird's real name is similar to the first Bat-Girl's: '''Mary Elizabeth 'Bette' Kane'''.

In [[Infinite Crisis]], it was implied that Flamebird originated from Earth-Two and was Bat-Girl's Earth-Two counterpart.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} According to the new continuity, the Earth-Two Flamebird replaced the Earth-One Bat-Girl during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

===Barbara Gordon===

The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] and [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] Batgirl was [[librarian]]-by-day '''Barbara Gordon''',<ref>{{cite book |last= Fox |first= Gardner |authorlink= Gardner Fox |title= ''Detective Comics'' #359|year= 1967 |publisher= DC Comics}}</ref> daughter of [[Gotham City]] Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. On her way to a masquerade ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara (also known as Babs) halted a kidnapping attempt on [[Bruce Wayne]] by the villainous [[Killer Moth]], attracting the attention of Batman and leading to a crime-fighting career. The most recent version of Batgirl's origin can be found in the [[Batgirl: Year One]] mini-series, published in 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dixon |first= Chuck |authorlink= Chuck Dixon |coauthors= Scott Beatty, Chuck Dixon |title= Batgirl: Year One |year= 2003 |publisher= DC Comics |isbn= 978-1401200800}}</ref>

At first, Batman did not approve of Barbara's involvement in crime-fighting, but as she solved more cases, beat more villains, and became more skilled, Batgirl gained Batman's respect and trust. In ''Detective Comics'' #363, the character's second appearance, Batman revealed his secret identity to Barbara, but made it seem to her to be a ruse meant to trick a villain; she did not learn Batman and Bruce Wayne were really the same person until much later; similarly, it took numerous appearances before Batman learned Batgirl's real name. Barbara Gordon appeared as Batgirl from 1967 to 1988, but she is frequently featured as Batgirl in "flashback" stories.

After relinquishing her role as Batgirl, Barbara Gordon was later shot in the spine and crippled by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].<ref> {{cite book |last= Moore |first= Alan |authorlink= Alan Moore |title= Batman: The Killing Joke |year= 1988 |publisher= DC Comics|isbn= 978-0930289454}}</ref> She continued to fight crime, even though she was wheelchair bound, under the guise of [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]], a free-lance information broker and expert hacker who has supported a number of different heroes, but most notably as the founder of and brains behind the [[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]].

===Helena Bertinelli===
{{main|Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)}}

During the late 1990s [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]] [[story arc]], a new Batgirl emerged.  She was revealed to be '''Helena Bertinelli''' (a.k.a. The Huntress). An [[earthquake]] had leveled [[Gotham City]], the government declared the city a [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]], and Batman disappeared. To bring order to the city, the Huntress assumed the mantle of The Bat discovering criminals feared her more as Batgirl than they did when she was the Huntress. When Batman returned, he officially dubbed her "Batgirl" and said if she failed him, she would have to give up the costume. When Batgirl failed to protect Batman's territory from [[Two-Face]] and his gang of over 200 criminals on her own, he held her personally responsible and stripped her of the mantle. As Huntress, Bertinelli would later join Oracle's [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]],<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone |first= Gail |authorlink= Gail Simone |title= Birds of Prey #65 |year= 2004 |publisher= DC Comics}}</ref> thus giving the group ''two'' former Batgirls.

===Cassandra Cain===
{{main|Cassandra Cain}}
[[Image:Knightalone.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Cassandra Cain as Batgirl. Art by [[Damion Scott]].]]

'''Cassandra Cain''' was a young woman of partly [[Asian people|Asian]] descent who became the third in-continuity Batgirl, with the approval of both [[Batman]] and [[Barbara Gordon]]. She was given Helena Bertinelli's Batgirl costume. Trained by her father, [[assassin]] [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], to be the ultimate [[martial artist]] and assassin, Cassandra was not taught to speak. Instead, the parts of her brain normally used for speech were trained so she could read other people's movements and body language and predict, with uncanny accuracy, their next move. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, a form of dyslexia that hampers her abilities to read and write. She eventually gave up the identity of Batgirl, with her solo series canceled. <ref>''Batgirl'' #73</ref>

Cassandra reprised her role as Batgirl in the [[Titans East]] storyline of ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'', where it was discovered that she had been influenced by a mind-altering drug administered by Deathstroke; the drug had forced her to become evil.

Freed of Deathstroke's control, she is back to being a hero and working under Batman in his newly rebuilt Outsiders.

===Charlotte Gage-Radcliffe===
{{main|Misfit (DC Comics)}}
'''Charlotte Gage-Radcliffe''', a young girl with inherent superpowers temporarily became the new Batgirl in the ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' series, until Oracle told her to drop the identity. She later returned under the alias of "Misfit". She became the third former Batgirl to join the Birds of Prey.

==Adaptations in other media==

{{main|Media Adaptations of Barbara Gordon}}

[[Barbara Gordon]]'s incarnation as Batgirl has become one of DC Comic's most recognizable female superhero icons. To date, Gordon's version of Batgirl has been adapted into all media relating to the [[Batman]] franchise including [[merchandise]], [[television]], [[animation]] and [[feature film]]. Notable adaptations of Batgirl include:

*'''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''': The Barbara Gordon Batgirl appeared in the final season of the live-action ''Batman'' television series in 1967, the same year as her comic-book debut.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin | url = http://www.tv.com/batman-1966/enter-batgirl-exit-penguin/episode/6903/summary.html | series = Batman | serieslink = Batman (TV series) | airdate = 1967-09-14 | season = 3 | number = 1}}</ref> In fact, she was created in cooperation with the show's producers, who wanted a female character who could be added to the show's regular cast.

*'''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''': The short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series (2002) featured a paralyzed Barbara Gordon ([[Dina Meyer]]) donning her Batgirl costume both in flashback sequences and in the present, thanks to a device that allows her to walk.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Pilot | url = http://www.tv.com/birds-of-prey/pilot/episode/158475/summary.html| series = Birds of Prey | serieslink = Birds of Prey (TV series) | airdate = 2002-10-09 | season = 1}}</ref>

*'''[[Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder]]''': Batgirl made her first animated appearance in [[1968 in television|1968]], turning up in a handful of episodes of the animated  [[Filmation]] series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'' and voiced by [[Jane Webb]]. The character was voiced by [[Melendy Britt]]<ref>[http://www.batmannews.de/gotham_city_central/flugelheim_museum/pics/batman_robin/pics_big/batgirl4.jpg]</ref> in the [[1977 in television|1977]] animated series entitled ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.

*'''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''': More recently, Barbara Gordon was a recurring character in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]],<ref>{{cite episode | title = Shadow of the Bat | url = http://www.tv.com/batman-the-animated-series/shadow-of-the-bat-part-1-of-2/episode/72331/summary.html | series = Batman: The Animated Series | serieslink = Batman: The Animated Series | airdate = 1993-09-13 | season = 2 | number = 1}}</ref> and later in the follow-up series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', by [[Tara Strong]]. In the animated series, she originally adopted the Batgirl identity to help her father when he was framed by [[Two-Face]].

*'''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''':A young Barbara Gordon assumed the role of Batgirl in the third season of ''The Batman'', voiced by [[Danielle Judovits]]. In that series, Barbara was close friends with the teenaged eco-terrorist Pamela Isley, who became transformed into [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] in the same two-part special that introduced Batgirl. 

*'''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''': The Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl was the inspiration for the character Barbara Wilson that was portrayed by actress [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the 1997 movie ''Batman & Robin''. This Batgirl was similar in many ways to Barbara Gordon (such as having a penchant for computers and motorcycles), but James Gordon's relatively small role in the films contributed to the differences.
