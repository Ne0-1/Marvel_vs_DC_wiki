'''Batgirl''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], frequently depicted as female counterparts to the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Originally created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]], a character that is (arguably) considered by some to be the first incarnation of Batgirl, the "'''Bat-Girl'''" '''[[Bette Kane|Betty Kane]]''', debuted in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #139 (April 1961) as the [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]-like sidekick to [[Batwoman]]. Following the promotion of [[Julius Schwartz]] to editor of the Batman-related comic book titles in 1964, the Bat-Girl character was removed from publication (along with Batwoman) and replaced by the "new" Batgirl '''[[Barbara Gordon]]''', police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]'s daughter, in late 1966. This version of Batgirl was introduced in [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Carmine Infantino]]'s ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, entitled "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl."

Batgirl proved vastly more popular than the earlier "Bat-Girl" and made regular, in-continuity appearances in DC comics from late 1966 to 1988. The official retirement of Batgirl took place in ''Batgirl Special'' #1 (June 1988), which was published a few months after Barbara Gordon's shooting by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in the [[graphic novel]] ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (March 1988). Editor [[Kim Yale]] and comic book author [[John Ostrander]] later reinvented the discarded Barbara Gordon character as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], the premier [[information broker]] of the [[DC Comics Universe]] and leader of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] organization.
In the 1999 story ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|Batman: No Man's Land]]'', '''[[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]]''' (better known as [[Huntress (comics)#Helena Bertinelli|Huntress]]) briefly assumes the role of Batgirl until she is stripped of the identity by Batman towards the conclusion of the story for violating his stringent codes. Within the same year, '''[[Cassandra Cain]]''' (created by [[Kelley Puckett]] and [[Damion Scott]]), introduced during the "No Man's Land" series, becomes the fourth Batgirl. She is mentored by Batman and Oracle. Cassandra Cain became the first version of the Batgirl character to be featured in an [[eponym]]ous monthly series, which was published from 2000 to 2006, ending with Cain relinquishing her role as Batgirl. Subsequently in the pages of ''[[Teen Titans]]'', Cassandra Cain reclaimed her former identity as Batgirl. Later still, she passes on the Batgirl alias to '''[[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]''' (previously known as [[Stephanie Brown (comics)#The Spoiler|Spoiler]] and [[Robin (comics)#Stephanie Brown|Robin]]) in the first issue of Brown's own ''Batgirl'' series (October 2009). That series was canceled at 24 issues. In September 2011, DC Comics relaunched the ''Batgirl'' title with Barbara Gordon, now cured of her paralysis, in the titular role.

''Batgirl'' has also been the title of three ongoing comic book series (as well as one comic book miniseries) published by DC Comics.

==Characters==
===Betty Kane===
{{main|Bette Kane}}

Following the accusations of homosexuality between Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] as described in [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), a female character, Kathy Kane the [[Batwoman]], was introduced in 1956 as a love interest for Batman.<ref name="Batman: The Complete History">{{Cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | authorlink=Les Daniels | title=Batman: The Complete History | publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] | year=2004 | page=93 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=73wknu2cVIkC | isbn=0-8118-4232-0}}</ref> In 1961, a second female character was introduced as a love interest for Robin.<ref name="Batman: The Complete History" /> Betty Kane as "Bat-Girl" was depicted as the niece of and Robin-like sidekick to Batwoman, first appearing in ''Batman'' #139 (1961).<ref>{{Cite book | last=Finger | first=Bill | authorlink=Bill Finger | title=Batman'' #139'' | date=April 1961 | publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> The creation of the Batman Family, which included Batman and Batwoman depicted as parents, Robin and Bat-Girl depicted as their children, the [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[imp]] [[Bat-Mite]] and the "family pet" [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], caused the Batman-related comic books to take "a wrong turn, switching from superheroes to situational comedy".<ref name="Batman: The Complete History" />

These characters were abandoned in 1964 when newly appointed Batman editor Julius Schwartz concluded they were too silly and therefore inappropriate.<ref name="Remembering Kathy Kane: The First Batwoman">{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batwoman/BatwomanHistory.htm | title=Remembering Kathy Kane: The First Batwoman | last=Grandinetti | first=Fred | work=[[Newsarama]] | accessdate=September 19, 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070710222202/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Batwoman/BatwomanHistory.htm | archivedate=July 10, 2007}}</ref> Schwartz had asserted that these characters should be removed, considering the Batman related comic books had steadily declined in sales, and restored the Batman mythology to its original conception of heroic vigilantism.<ref name="Batman: The Complete History" /> Bat-Girl, along with other characters in the Batman Family, were [[retcon]]ned out of existence following the 1985 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Wolfman | first=Marv | authorlink=Marv Wolfman | title=Crisis on Infinite Earths | year=1985 | publisher=DC Comics | isbn=1-5638-9750-4}}</ref> However, even though Bat-Girl did not exist in the post-''Crisis'' continuity, a modified version of the character, Mary Elizabeth "Bette" Kane, was introduced as the superhero [[Flamebird]], who continues to appear in DC Comics publications.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Pérez | first=George | authorlink=George Pérez | title=Secret Origins Annual'' #3'' | year=1989 | publisher=DC Comics | url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=45557}}</ref>

===Barbara Gordon===
{{main|Barbara Gordon}}

A new, more independent Batgirl — Barbara "Babs" Gordon, the daughter of Batman supporting character Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] — debuted in ''Detective Comics'' #359 (cover-dated January 1967, but released in November 1966).<ref>{{Cite book | last=Fox | first=Gardner | authorlink=Gardner Fox | date=January 1967 | title=Detective Comics'' #359'' | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 122 |quote =  Nine months before making her debut on ''Batman'', a new Batgirl appeared in the pages of ''Detective Comics''...Yet the idea for the debut of Barbara Gordon, according to editor Julius Schwartz, was attributed to the television series executives' desire to have a character that would appeal to a female audience and for this character to originate in the comics.  Hence, writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino collaborated on "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!"}}</ref> In her debut, Barbara is on her way to a masquerade ball dressed as a female version of Batman when she disrupts a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the villainous [[Killer Moth]]. This attracts the attention of Batman and leads to her establishing a crime-fighting career. This new character, jointly created by Editor Julius Schwartz, artist Carmine Infantino and author Gardner Fox, was a collaboration between DC Comics and the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series of the late 1960s which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. When television producer [[William Dozier]] sought to renew the Batman program for a third season, he asked Schwartz for a new female character to be introduced in the comic book medium, which could be adapted into the television series in order to attract a female audience.<ref name="Batman: The Complete History" /> The new version of Batgirl was written as an adult, having earned a doctorate in library science and maintaining a career as head of Gotham City Public Library.<ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian">{{Cite book | last=Arant | first=Wendi | coauthors=Candace Benefiel | title=The Image and Role of the Librarian | publisher=Haworth Press | year=2002 | pages=77–78 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RXsa43PYarQC | isbn=0-7890-2099-8}}</ref>

As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon proved to be more popular than the previous Bat-Girl and Batwoman duo, though she was not a sidekick, but an independent crime fighter. Barbara Gordon appeared as Batgirl in both ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'', as well as other DC Comics publications unrelated to Batman. The character also received a starring role in the ''Batman Family'' comic book series which debuted in 1975, where she became part of the "Dynamite Duo: Batgirl & Robin" with Dick Grayson.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Maggin | first=Elliot | authorlink=Elliot S. Maggin | title=The Batman Family'' #1'' | date=September/October 1975 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Described as one of the most popular characters to appear in publications during the Silver Age of Comic Books,<ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian" /> Barbara Gordon appeared as Batgirl regularly from 1966 to 1988, and she is frequently featured as Batgirl in "flashback" stories in current DC Comics publications. Famously, Barbara Gordon is shot through the [[spinal cord]] by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] in ''Batman: The Killing Joke''.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Moore | first=Alan | authorlink=Alan Moore | title=Batman: The Killing Joke | year=1988 | publisher=DC Comics | isbn=978-0930289454}}</ref> The plot, which led to Gordon's [[paralysis]], subsequently became a point of controversy among critics and commentators.<ref>{{cite web | title=Variations on a Theme | last=Krause | first=Melissa | date=August 18, 2007 | url=http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/08/18/variations-on-a-theme-2/ | work=Newsarama | accessdate=December 19, 2007}}</ref> Editor Kim Yale and author John Ostrander revived the character in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #23 (1989) under the guise of Oracle, a freelance information broker and expert [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]].<ref>{{Cite book | last=Ostrander | first=John | authorlink=John Ostrander | title=Suicide Squad'' #23'' | publisher=DC Comics | date=January 1989}}</ref> As Oracle, Barbara Gordon is written as an ally to various DC Universe superheroes, but is most notable as the founder and leader of operations of the "Birds of Prey" superhero organization. 

As part of DC Comics' 2011 line-wide title relaunch, [[The New 52]], Barbara Gordon's paralysis, and her identity of Oracle, were retconned as lasting only a temporary span of time. In the ''Batgirl'' series (volume 4) that was launched in September 2011 as part of the retcon, Gordon has resumed her activities as Batgirl, though the trauma of the events of ''The Killing Joke'' still manifests itself when confronted with an opponent who points a gun at her.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Gail Simone]]|penciler=Ardian Syaf|inker=Vicente Cifuentes|title=Batgirl|issue=1|volume=4|publisher=DC Comics|date=November 2011}}</ref>  This new series takes a lighthearted approach to the Batgirl character that is offset with the protagonist struggling with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

===Helena Bertinelli===
{{main|Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|No Man's Land (comics)}}

Eleven years after the editorial retirement of Barbara Gordon as Batgirl, a new version of the character was introduced in ''Shadow of the Bat'' #83 during the [[maxiseries]] ''Batman: No Man's Land'' (1999).<ref>{{Cite book | last=Gale | first=Bob | authorlink=Bob Gale | coauthors=Devin Grayson | title=Batman: No Man's Land, Vol. 1 | publisher=DC Comics | date=April 1999 | isbn=978-1563895647}}</ref> In ''[[Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' #120 (1999), the new Batgirl is revealed to be Helena Bertinelli, an established DC comics superhero alternatively known as the Huntress.<ref name="Batman Unmasked">{{Cite book | last=Brooker | first=Will | title=Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon | year=2001 | publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] | pages=187, 151, 319 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GNRreYO91ogC | isbn=0-8264-1343-9}}</ref> Bertinelli is eventually forced to abandon the mantle by Batman.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Rucka | first=Greg | coauthors=Kelley Puckett | title=Batman: No Man's Land, Vol. 3 | publisher=DC Comics | date=April 2000 | isbn=1-5638-9634-6}}</ref> After reclaiming her identity as the Huntress, Bertinelli later joins Oracle's Birds of Prey, becoming the second former Batgirl to be on the team's roster.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Simone | first=Gail | authorlink=Gail Simone | title=Birds of Prey'' #65'' | date=May 2004 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

===Cassandra Cain===
{{main|Cassandra Cain}}

Depicted as a [[martial arts]] [[child prodigy]], Cassandra Cain is written as a young woman of partly [[Asian people|Asian]] descent who becomes the third in-continuity Batgirl, with the approval of both Batman and Oracle, following her introduction in ''Batman'' #567 (1999) as part of the ''Batman: No Man's Land'' crossover.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Conroy | first=Mike | title=500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes | publisher=Chrysalis | year=2002 | isbn=1-8441-1004-4}}</ref> Cassandra Cain wears the same Batgirl costume worn by Helena Bertinelli. Raised by assassin [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], Cassandra Cain was not taught spoken language, but instead was taught to "read" physical movement. Subsequently, Cain's only form of communication was body language.<ref name="Nature or Nurture?">{{cite web | last=Richards | first=Dave | title=Nature or Nurture? Andersen Gabrych talks ''Batgirl'' | date=March 4, 2005 | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=4907 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref> The parts of the character's brain normally used for speech were trained so Cain could read other people's body language and predict, with uncanny accuracy, their next move. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, a form of dyslexia that hampers her abilities to read and write.

Despite Cain's disability, author Andersen Gabrych describes the character's unique form of language as the key factor in what makes Cain an excellent detective; the ability to walk into a room and "know" something is wrong based on body language.<ref name="Nature or Nurture?" /> During the first arc of the ''Batgirl'' comic book series entitled ''Silent Running'', Cassandra Cain encounters a psychic who "reprograms" her brain, enabling her to comprehend verbal language, while simultaneously losing the ability to predict movements.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Peterson | first=Scott | coauthors=Kelley Puckett | title=Batgirl, Vol. 1: Silent Running | publisher=DC Comics | date=March 2001 | isbn=978-1563897054}}</ref> This issue is resolved during the second arc of the series, ''Batgirl: A Knight Alone'', when Batgirl encounters the assassin [[Lady Shiva]] who agrees to teach her how to predict movement once again.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Puckett | first=Kelley | title=Batgirl, Vol. 2: A Knight Alone | publisher=DC Comics | date=November 2001 | isbn=978-1563898525}}</ref> Six years after its debut, DC Comics canceled the ''Batgirl'' comic book series with issue #73 (2006), ending with Cain relinquishing her role as Batgirl.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Gabrych | first=Andersen | title=Batgirl: Destruction's Daughter | date=September 2006 | publisher=DC Comics | isbn=1-4012-0896-7}}</ref>

When DC Comics continuity skipped forward [[One Year Later|one year]] after the events of the limited series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Cassandra Cain is revived as leader of the [[League of Assassins]], having abandoned her previous characterization as an [[altruist]]. The character's progression from hero to villain angered some of her fans and was accompanied by heavy criticism.<ref>{{cite web | last=Taylor | first=Robert | title=Reflections: Talking ''Robin'' (And Batgirl) With Adam Beechen | work=Comic Book Resources | date=November 5, 2006 | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8802 | accessdate=February 19, 2008}}</ref> Cain reprised her role as Batgirl in the "[[Titans East]]" (2007) storyline of ''[[Teen Titans]]'',<ref>{{Cite book | last=Johns | first=Geoff | authorlink=Geoff Johns | title=Teen Titans'' #43'' | date=March 2007 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> where it was discovered that she had been influenced by a mind-altering drug administered by [[supervillain]] [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. Following the conclusion of the storyline, DC Comics has restored Cain's original characterization as a superhero and the character has been given a supporting role in the comic book series ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Batman and the Outsiders]]''.

Following the events of [[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne|Batman's disappearance]], Cassandra, acting under her mentor's orders in the event of his death, handed over the Batgirl mantle to Stephanie Brown, the former Spoiler and Robin.<ref name="The Road Home">{{Cite book | last=Miller | first=Bryan | title=Bruce Wayne: The Road Home: Batgirl | date=December 2010 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> After decling an offer from Tim Drake to reclaim the Batgirl mantle from Stephanie,<ref>''Red Robin'' #17 (October 2010)</ref> Cassandra rejoined the Batman Family under the new identity of Blackbat.<ref>''Batman Inc.'' #6 (May 2011)</ref> She currently acts as the Hong Kong representative of [[Batman Inc.]]

===Stephanie Brown===
{{main|Stephanie Brown (comics)}}

Stephanie Brown, formerly the Spoiler and briefly the fourth Robin, takes up the mantle of Batgirl after Cassandra Cain gives Brown her costume under Batman's order.<ref name="The Road Home" /> Eventually, Barbara Gordon approves of Brown as her newest successor — and she gives Brown her own Batgirl costume and becomes her mentor for a period. Brown is the fourth in-continuity Batgirl and the second Batgirl to star in her own ongoing ''Batgirl'' comic book series.

==Publication history==
The first ''Batgirl'' ongoing [[comic book]] series was published in 2000 and featured Cassandra Cain as Batgirl. In 2009, a new ''Batgirl'' [[miniseries]] was created also featuring Cain, whom, by the end of the [[Book series|series]], passes on her Batgirl identity to character [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]. The third series features new characters, as well as Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], who will monitor Brown's actions as Batgirl. The series is a direct sequel to ''Oracle: The Cure'', part of the "[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]" story arc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Volume one (2000–2006)===
[[Cassandra Cain]] was [[DC Universe]]'s Batgirl from 1999 until 2009. The [[Asian American]] daughter of two assassins, Cain herself grew up to be the greatest [[Assassination|assassin]] in the world. She is featured in the comic book series ''No Man's Land'', the eponymous ''Batgirl'' (2000 series and 2008 mini-series), the "One Year Later" storyline, ''52: World War III'', and ''Batman and the Outsiders'' (vol. 2).

===Volume two (2008-2009)===
In this six-issue miniseries, Cassandra searches for her father and [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. She eventually finds her father and faces him. Her father falls off a building when Cain is unable to save him. Batman saves him and lets Batgirl move into [[Wayne Manor]] again. Batgirl soon realizes that Deathstroke has opened up an academy where he is training her siblings.

===Volume three (2009–2011)===
Taking place after ''Oracle: The Cure'', [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] is given the Batgirl mantle by a disillusioned Cassandra Cain. Stephanie hides her identity from her mother, who does not approve of it and wants her to be an ordinary girl.

[[Barbara Gordon]] meets with [[Leslie Thompkins]], who has taken in the crippled daughter of the villain [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] known as Wendy. Barbara later has lunch with her father ([[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]), who tries to set her up with a new officer. She gets a call from Batman, who has deduced that the new Batgirl is Stephanie Brown.

After 24 issues, ''Batgirl'' was cancelled in August 2011 as part of a company-wide relaunch in the wake of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crossover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/05/31/dc-comics-announces-historic-renumbering-of-all-superhero-titles-and-landmark-day-and-date-digital-distribution/ |title=DC Universe: The Source » Blog Archive » DC Comics Announces Historic Renumbering of All Superhero Titles and Landmark Day-and-Date Digital Distribution |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref>

==Character attributes==
Betty Kane's Bat-Girl was primarily interested in vigilantism in order to develop a relationship with the original Robin, Dick Grayson, as her introduction into publication was a deliberate attempt to avoid further allegations of homosexuality that ''Seduction of the Innocent'' presented to the public.<ref name="Batman Unmasked" /> Depicted as the niece of Batwoman, Bat-Girl had developed a crush on Robin after arriving in Gotham City and decided to fashion her own superhero persona based on Robin's costume. Her appearance in comic books primarily displayed her character attempting to develop a romantic relationship with Robin, despite his embarrassment or lack of interest.<ref name="Batman: The Complete History" /> Unlike later Batgirl characters, Bat-Girl was not a female version of Batman but rather a female version of Robin.

When Julius Schwartz asked Carmine Infantino for a redesign of the Bat-Girl character, Infantino recalled Betty Kane's character as a "pesky girl version of Robin", and decided to come up with something more original.<ref>{{cite web | last=Fitzgerald | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Fitzgerald (author) | title=Carmine Infantino: Decades at DC and Beyond | year=2007 | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004812442.cfm | accessdate=November 23, 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071124223127/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004812442.cfm | archivedate=November 24, 2007 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino's new "Batgirl" was written as an adult and as a career woman working as head of Gotham City Public Library. Though the Barbara Gordon character saw Batman as her inspiration and idol, fashioning her crime-fighting persona after him, her primary concern was solving cases and often worked independently from Batman and Robin. Batgirl was primarily featured in ''Detective Comics'' in stories separate from the Dynamic Duo.<ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian" />

Barbara Gordon's Batgirl made her first animated appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]''<ref>{{cite web | title=The Batman/Superman Hour | year=1968 | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062544/ | accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref> in 1968 and was also adapted into its successor animated program ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' in 1977.<ref>{{cite web | title=Pest | work=The New Adventures of Batman | publisher=TV.com | date=February 10, 1977 | url=http://www.tv.com/the-new-adventures-of-batman/the-pest/episode/194782/summary.html | accessdate=January 2, 2008}}</ref> During the 1990s and 2000s, Barbara Gordon appears as Batgirl in the series of animated programs and animated films which comprise the [[DC Animated Universe]]; these include ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'',<ref name="Shadow of the Bat">{{cite web | last=Reaves | first=Brynne | title=Shadow of the Bat | work=Batman: The Animated Series | publisher=TV.com | date=September 13, 1993 | url=http://www.tv.com/batman-the-animated-series/shadow-of-the-bat-part-1-of-2/episode/72331/summary.html | accessdate=January 2, 2008}}</ref> ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'',<ref>{{cite web | last=Dini | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Dini | title=Holiday Knights | work=The New Batman Adventures | publisher=TV.com | date=September 13, 1997 | url=http://www.tv.com//holiday-knights/episode/115343/summary.html | accessdate=January 2, 2008}}</ref> and ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.

In ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', Batgirl's costume somewhat resembles the design worn by her [[DC animated universe]] incarnation. In her first appearance on the series in the episode "The Last Patrol!", an in-joke reference to the 1960s television series is made, with Batman being unaware of Batgirl's identity. Barbara Gordon and Bette Kane have also appeared in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''. In 2012, Batgirl will star alongside [[Supergirl]] and [[Wonder Girl]] in ''Super Best Friends Forever'', a series of shorts developed by [[Lauren Faust]] for the ''[[DC Nation Shorts|DC Nation]]'' block on [[Cartoon Network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=1139 |title=The World's Finest |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-13}}</ref>

In addition to animated adaptations, the Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl served as the inspiration for the character Barbara Wilson in the 1997 feature film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. Departing from the comic book character's history, the alternate version of Barbara is portrayed by [[Alicia Silverstone]] as the niece of [[Alfred Pennyworth]], Bruce Wayne's butler and Batman's loyal assistant.<ref name="Modern Amazons">{{Cite book | last=Mainon | first=Dominique | coauthors=James Ursini | title=The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women on Screen | year=2006 | publisher=Hal Leonard | pages=135–137 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PDWlgucdqUMC | isbn=0-8791-0327-2}}</ref> The short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series, which aired on [[The WB]] network in 2002, features a paralyzed Barbara Gordon donning her Batgirl costume after creating a device that allows her to walk.<ref>{{cite web | last=Armus | first=Adam | coauthors=Kay Foster | title=Lady Shiva | work=Birds of Prey | publisher=TV.com | date=November 27, 2002 | url=http://www.tv.com/birds-of-prey/lady-shiva/episode/194250/summary.html | accessdate=January 2, 2008}}</ref> The series featured [[Dina Meyer]] as Barbara Gordon, in a future where she has been paralyzed by the Joker and operates as Oracle.<ref name="Modern Amazons" />

==Cultural impact==
The depiction of the Barbara Gordon incarnation of Batgirl as a career-oriented woman, coupled with her alter-ego as a crimefighter, is considered to be symbolic of the women's empowerment movement of the 1960s according to critic and historian [[Peter Sanderson]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Sanderson | first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Sanderson | title=Comics in Context #67: Catch As Cats Can | date=January 7, 2005 | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595646p7.html | work=[[IGN]] | accessdate=June 9, 2008}}</ref> Gordon's career as a librarian also represented a "valued and honored profession" within mainstream American comics, despite the fact that comic books were not considered to be a respectable pastime by library professionals.<ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian" />

<blockquote>...likely explanations for why Batgirl's alter ego was a librarian are (a) librarianship was at the time an established and acceptable occupation for a(n) (unmarried) young woman, and (b) Barbara Gordon's job as a seemingly meek and passive librarian had to be considered an ideal contrast to her truly significant (and exciting) work as Batgirl.<ref name="The Image and Role of the Librarian" /></blockquote>

Actress [[Yvonne Craig]], who was cast as Batgirl during the final season of the ''Batman'' television series, also portrayed the character in the 1972 [[public service announcement]] for the [[United States Department of Labor]] advocating [[equal pay for women|equal pay]].<ref name="Yvonne Craig as Batgirl in a Public Service Announcement for the U.S. Department of Labor">{{cite web | title=Yvonne Craig as Batgirl in a Public Service Announcement for the U.S. Department of Labor | year=1972 | url=http://www.yvonnecraig.com/up_close_tv.php | work=YvonneCraig.com | accessdate=June 9, 2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080622140343/http://www.yvonnecraig.com/up_close_tv.php | archivedate=June 22, 2008 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> Craig has stated her portrayal of Batgirl remains a symbol of women's empowerment.<ref name="interviewyvonne">{{cite web | last=Schiff | first=Laura | title=Interview With Yvonne | year=1998 | url=http://yvonnecraig.com/up_close_interviews.php | work=Femme Fatales Magazine | accessdate=June 9, 2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080622140336/http://yvonnecraig.com/up_close_interviews.php | archivedate=June 22, 2008 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> Despite this, the Batgirl character has often been criticized for being a distaff variation of Batman.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Flood | first=Michael | title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=2007 | location=[[London]] | page=256 | isbn=978-0415333436}}</ref> Compared to Wonder Woman, described as "the principal icon of superheroines", Batgirl has been disregarded as a derivative of her male counterpart.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Zimmerman | first=David A. | title=Comic Book Character: Unleashing the Hero in Us All | publisher=InterVarsity Press | year=2004 | page=60 | isbn=0-8308-3260-2}}</ref> When Yvonne Craig portrayed Batgirl in the ''Batman'' television series, she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat; her fight scenes were all based on choreographed dance routines of Broadway showgirls, leading some to claim this made her appear as an inferior version of Batman.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Early | first=Frances H. | coauthors=Kathleen Kennedy | title=Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors | publisher=Syracuse University Press | year=2003 | page=136 | isbn=0-8156-2968-0}}</ref>
