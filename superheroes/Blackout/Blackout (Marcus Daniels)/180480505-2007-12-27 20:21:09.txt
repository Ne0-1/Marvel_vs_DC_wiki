===Fictional character biography===
Marcus Daniels was born in [[Flushing, Queens]], New York City.  He was working as a laboratory assistant to Dr. Abner Croft, a physicist hoping to build a device capable of tapping into energies from other dimensions. Croft always looked down on Daniels’ inferior knowledge, making him feel useless. Daniels always wondered what it would be like to harness the energy they were researching, to be powerful. After an accident bathed him in the extra-dimensional energy of the Darkforce, he had the chance to find out. Calling himself Blackout, his body was now flushed with power, becoming a surface of control of the Darkforce dimension. However, despite his powers threatening to go out of control, he escaped from Croft’s attempts to cure him and fled.

Blackout returned to the laboratories, however, as he needed the stabilizer device to control his energies. But he also returned to find revenge on Croft — Blackout's sanity began to suffer as well. He believed Croft was researching energies from "Black Stars" and that his body now generated such energy. He further believed that Croft was defrauding the government with his research and had bribed a judge to frame him for stealing his secrets. Instead of an accident causing his powers, Daniels thought Dr. Croft willfully subjected him to an experiment in exchange for dropping charges against him.

[[Nova (comics)|Nova]] encountered Blackout on his way to exact revenge, and Blackout easily defeated the young hero. Before Nova could catch up with him, Blackout returned to the labs, killing Croft and his new assistant by letting them “merge with the color spectrum” (actually, by shunting them to the Darkforce dimension.) Following another skirmish with Nova, Blackout himself vanished into this dimension when he fell back onto the stabilizer during the battle, destroying it.<ref>''Nova'' #19</ref>

The stabilizer somehow ended up at [[Project Pegasus]], the governmental energy research laboratory. An attack by the Lava Men and the presence of [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] (Monica Rambeau) managed to activate the device, which transported Blackout back to Earth. Still suffering from the delusion that Croft was still alive and out to harm him, he tried to escape. Blackout was coerced by another Project captive, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], into freeing herself and other superhuman criminals [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] and the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in order to gain revenge on their captors. The villains were confronted by the Avengers, but Blackout and Moonstone escaped to the Darkforce Dimension by nearly causing the nuclear core of the complex to meltdown as a distraction.

Moonstone, a former psychiatrist, treated Blackout in order to learn his true origin, but he remained in an irrational state. When the Avengers tracked them down, Blackout opened up another aperture into the Darkforce dimension in attempting to escape them, sucking himself and Moonstone inside.<ref>''Avengers'' #236-238</ref> Moonstone helped Blackout navigate through the dimension, eventually arriving on the surface of the moon. She hoped to find another stone similar to that which gave her powers, but they encountered the [[Inhumans (comics)|Inhumans]] and their ally, [[Dazzler]], who defeated the villains and returned them to Project: Pegasus on Earth.<ref>''Dazzler'' #32</ref>

Moonstone next appeared recruited by [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] to form his version of the [[Masters of Evil]], and she brought Blackout in tow. By this time, Blackout's mental condition was so unstable that at times he sank into a nearly catatonic state, only responsive to Moonstone's manipulative commands. Zemo, however, with the help of the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] had created a device to mentally force Blackout to obey his commands. Blackout was instrumental in Zemo's takeover of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' [[Avengers Mansion|headquarters]] by sending the entire mansion into the Darkforce dimension in one of the team’s darkest hours. [[Doctor Druid]], used his psychic ability to break through Zemo and Moonstone’s manipulations, restoring some of Blackout’s mental faculties. With relative sanity, Blackout resisted Zemo's mental commands, the strain of which made Blackout collapse from a massive cerebral hemorrhage.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277</ref>

Blackout's body was remanded into the custody of the Commission on Superhuman Activities. Years later, his body was taken by Baron Zemo, manipulated like a puppet on strings to serve as a member of his team as he confronted the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] over the life of their member [[Genis-Vell|Photon]]. During the battle between the two teams, Zemo revealed Blackout was merely a shell in which he kept the Smuggler trapped. This had the desired effect of turning his brother, Atlas against his team, and Zemo gained the upper hand. He also used Blackout’s access to the Darkforce dimension in severing Photon’s physical form.

===Powers and abilities===
Blackout was exposed to cosmic radiation, giving him the power to tap into the [[Darkforce]], a source of infinite dark energy, and to manipulate it in various ways. He could project Darkforce as concussive energy with tremendous force.  Blackout could mentally open portals to and from the Darkforce dimension. He could create and control solid simple solid geometric shapes from Darkforce, such as discs, cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes. These objects absorbed energy directed against them, and would remain solid as long as he exerted conscious control over them. He could psionically levitate Darkforce objects, and could fly by riding on them.

Blackout was mentally unstable due to his time spent in the Darkforce Dimension, and sometimes entered a nearly catatonic state.  His control over Darkforce was dependent on his mental clarity, and would weaken when he was fatigued.  Training with [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] allowed him to maintain his Darkforce constructs for a considerably longer period of time.

Blackout wore a costume with circuitry that helped him confine the Darkforce within his body.  The costume was designed by Dr. Abner Croft.

Blackout had a master's degree in physics, especially in the study of radiation.

===Fictional character biography===
The second Blackout was a darkness-generating mutant and professional criminal who first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' #2 ([[1991]]). He has the ability to automatically generate a light-dampening field which negates all visible light in a significant area. His albino-esque complexion and extreme physical sensitivity to sunlight & light in general likely accounts for this power-manifestation, and its vampiric similarities apparently led him to have his teeth & fingernails replaced with mechanically-enhanced metal ones. 

Blackout was initially employed by the demonic crime-lord [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]] as an enforcer and assassin. Deathwatch ordered Blackout to search for stolen bio-toxin canisters, and murdered detective Frank Loretti and his family as well as Ralph D'Amato's parents before battling the Ghost Rider ([[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Dan Ketch]]) for the first time.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #2</ref> Deathwatch and Blackout then attacked the NYPD's 75th Precinct police station.  Blackout murdered several police officers, stole the bio-toxin canisters, and abducted Paulie Stratton and the Cypress Hill Jokers.  He battled the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s men as well as Ghost Rider again. Blackout was disfigured in the battle when he was scorched by hellfire by trying to bite through Ghost Rider's jacket.  This caused him to become Ghost Rider's sworn arch-enemy.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #3</ref> Blackout learned Ghost Rider's identity as Dan Ketch, and murdered his comatose sister Barbara Ketch in revenge.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #7</ref> Blackout then kills Ketch's acquaintances, newspaper vendor Theodore Larsen and Father Michael McDonald.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #8</ref> 

Blackout continued to stalk Ghost Rider.  He encountered [[HEART (comics)|HEART]], and menaced some [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] children, murdering the Morlock [[Pixie (Morlock)|Pixie]] (not to be confused with the X-Men character of the same name, [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]]). The Morlocks had been in conflict over a plan to change babies into mutated forms. Ghost Rider's incorrect belief it was Blackout behind the vanishing of babies brings the attention of the real Blackout. Though the children are rescued safely, with the assistance of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], Blackout manages to kill Pixie and escape after battling Ghost Rider again.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #9</ref> 

Blackout murdered several sewer workers, then battled Ghost Rider, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]] and HEART again; during this battled, his face is further disfigured by Blaze's gun, and Blackout was finally captured by the police.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #14-15</ref>  He was freed from prison by the [[Firm (comics)|Firm]], then abducted Ketch's mother and friends, seemingly murdering Dan Ketch by tearing his throat out while he is in human form. Only supernatural intervention from other sources allows Dan to recover. In the meantime, Ghost Rider is still able to fight. Around this time, Blackout went on a murderous rampage through Central Park, leading to a hostage situation with the police. With Mr. Stern, Blackout is captured by Ghost Rider and sealed in a mausoleum.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #25</ref> 

With Mr. Stern, Blackout escaped the mausoleum.  Blackout experienced a vision of [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]], the demon-goddess, who claimed she was his grandmother.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #28</ref> Blackout joined forces with Lilith and the Lilin, and would team up with many super-powered offspring of Lilith, all doing her will. Blackout, [[Creed (comics)|Creed]], and [[Pilgrim (comics)|Pilgrim]] abducted John Blaze's son, then battled Blaze and Ghost Rider.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #1</ref> Alongside Lilth and the Lilin, Blackout battled Ghost Rider, John Blaze, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]], and the [[Darkhold|Darkhold Redeemers]] in Greenland.  [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] impaled Blackout through the eye, seemingly killing him.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol 2 #31</ref> Blackout, however, survived.

During one of his many times working with Lilith, he re-inspires the police officer Badilino into becoming [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]] again. Wracked with doubt after learning his demonic mission means little, Badilino is frozen with indecision as Lilith's forces, Blackout, Dark Legion and Meatmarket attack his precinct. Seeing Blackout threaten to consume a small child, Badilino transforms and literally leaps into action. The child is saved. Blackout takes an opportunity minutes later to attack Dan Ketch's friend Stacy Dolan. She is saved by Ghost Rider. Blackout and the Lilin are distracted by the arrival of [[Doctor Strange]] and other [[Midnight Sons]], who are their primary objective. A spell, cast as the Sons retreat from overwhelming forces, protects the citizens in the precinct from being seen by Lilin.

After being defeated by the [[Midnight Sons]], Blackout had his face deformities repaired and went back to work as a hired assassin, also eliminating a few personal grudges along the way until finally being captured by Ghost Rider. He was hoisted and chained over the World Trade Center where he is thought to have burned to death.  Much later, Blackout was seen among the escaping villains in the prison breakout in ''New Avengers'' #1, and his sudden lack-of-death is never explained.

Blackout has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.<ref>New Avengers #35</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Blackout is apparently descended from both human and demonic ancestors, and his hybrid physiology gives him a number of superhuman abilities.  His strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes are near superhuman.  He can see in near darkness, and he has the psionic ability to extinguish both natural and artificial light sources in his immediate vicinity.  His skin is highly sensitive to light.

He is a highly experienced hand-to-hand combatant, a superior acrobat, and wrestler.
