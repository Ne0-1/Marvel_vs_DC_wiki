'''Blackout''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s, both [[supervillain]]s, in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  

The first Blackout was Marcus Daniels; he first appeared in ''[[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'' #19.  Marcus Daniels was the assistant to Dr. Abner Croit, a physicist studying a kind of near-indestructible "solid darkness" from another dimension, called the "[[darkforce]]".  Croit convinced Daniels to subject himself to experiments with the force; these experiments empowered Daniels with the Darkforce.  Daniels wore a suit to keep from merging with the darkforce dimension.  Adopting the name Blackout he became a robber, and soon returned to Croit's lab to attempt to steal a device which would stabilize his powers, only to encounter the neophyte hero Nova.  Blackout was trapped in the darkforce dimension, an imprisonment that drove him mad.  He returned to Earth and was imprisoned, only to team up with the villaness [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].  The two were defeated by [[Dazzler]] and the [[Inhumans]] on the [[moon]].  Blackout was freed one final time by the second [[Baron Zemo]] and recruited to the new [[Masters of Evil]], along with his old ally Moonstone.  Zemo controlled Blackout using technology created by the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]; Moonstone oversaw Blackout's activities and tried to manipulate him to her own ends.  In the end, the Masters conquered the Avengers' Mansion and had Blackout seal it away in a wall of darkforce.  However, and Zemo's constant pushing of Blackout proved too taxing and caused him to suffer a fatal [[cerebral hemorrhage]] when he tried to resist Zemo's commands.

The second Blackout was a darkness-generating [[vampire]] who first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' #2 ([[1991]]).  He fought the Ghost Rider (Dan Ketch), killing several of his close associates.  He later became allied with [[Lilith]], the demon-goddess, who he claimed was his grandmother.
