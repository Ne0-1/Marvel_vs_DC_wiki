'''Ultraa''' is a [[DC Comics]] character, originally the first superhuman on [[Earth Prime]]. The original first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #153 (April 1978), he was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[George Tuska]]. The current Ultraa first appeared in ''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #13 (Winter 1993), written by [[Kevin Dooley]] and drawn by [[Greg LaRocque]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Jack Grey (Pre-Crisis)===
Ultraa's origin was very similar to [[Superman]]'s, in that he was born on an alien world, and sent to Earth to escape its destruction. He landed in the [[Australian Outback]] and was raised by [[Indigenous Australians]] under the alias Jack Grey. In his first appearance, Ultraa plans to go to the [[United States|United States of America]] and become a superhero. As he runs across the ocean, he is detected by the US Air Force, which sends a plane after him. Ultraa retaliates to this attack, and is mistaken for a villain by the Justice League, who are visiting from Earth One. Ultraa eventually decides Earth Prime was not ready for superheroes and accompanies the League back to their world.

Ultraa next appeared in ''Justice League of America'' #158 (September 1978) in which, following a battle between the League and the [[Injustice Gang]] which threatened civilians, he decides Earth One was also endangered by the presence of superhumans. He uses a ray gun to create a feeling of apathy in both the League and the Injustice Gang. Unfortunately, it works on the heroes but has the opposite effect on the villains. Ultraa attempts to fight the Injustice Gang single handedly but fails. After the JLA overcome the ray's effects to defeat the Gang, they no longer trust Ultraa.

===Ultraa (Post-Crisis)===
Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], the original Ultraa was [[retcon]]ned out of history, along with Earth-Prime. In ''Justice League Quarterly'' #13 (Winter 1993), Ultraa is reintroduced as a native of Almerac and the betrothed of [[Maxima (comics)|Queen Maxima]]. He arrives on Earth to look for her, and gets into a fight with [[Captain Atom]], before Maxima sends him home.

Ultraa later appears as a member of the [[United Nations]] funded League Busters in ''Justice League International'' v2, #65 (Jun 1994).

==Powers and abilities==
*The original Ultraa could not fly but had super speed, supersenses, and super strength. He could run fast enough to pass over large bodies of water. This Ultraa's only weakness was targeted [[ultrasonics]].
*As a scion of the Blood Royale of Almerac the modern Ultraa commands a vast array of powers that come from years of selective breeding and gene therapy. Like Maxima the current Ultraa has incredible strength, telepathy, telekinesis and flight.

==Notes==
*The Jack Grey version of Ultraa was the first superhero to appear on his particular parallel Earth. The second was [[Superman Prime|Superboy Prime]].
*An alternate version of Ultraa from one of the Earths in the new 52 multiverse was killed in [[Countdown: Arena]]#1
