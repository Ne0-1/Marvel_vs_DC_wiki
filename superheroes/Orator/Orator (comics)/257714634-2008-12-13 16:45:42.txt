'''Orator (Victor Ludwig)''' was a minor [[fictional character]] from [[Marvel Comics]].  

==Fictional character biography==
He was a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] who was recruited into the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. He first appeared when the Acolytes were searching for their missing leader [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who was also presumed dead at the time. Instead, they found [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]], his [[Clone (genetics)|clone]], and attempted but failed to turn him into their new leader. His first appearance was in the [[limited series]] ''Magneto'' #1. Orator hasn't been seen since the mini, and never on [[Genosha]] before or after the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]' attack, so he might be still alive, though that is uncertain at this point. He also hasn't been seen after [[M-Day]] and the [[House of M]], so he might have lost his powers, but that is unclear at the moment.

==Powers and abilities==
Emotion enhancement; heightened empathetic awareness.
