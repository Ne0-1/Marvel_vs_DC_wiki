'''Miss Steed''', also known as '''Black Queen''' is a fictional character, a mutant in the Marvel Comics Universe. Her first appearance was in Excalibur Vol.1 #96.

Infiltrating the Inner Circle of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] as a double agent for the being known as [[Onslaught]], Steed's whereabouts have been unknown since the [[London]] Inner Circle was brought down by [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].

==Alternate versions==

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Ms. Steed was known as Damask and was the leader of the Pale Riders, a trio of assassins working for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. 

Little is known about Damask before her first appearance. She was a student of the Shadow King, who was sexually attracted to her, and quickly became a high-ranked assassin, working for Apocalypse as the leader of a the Dark Lord's elite taskforce, the Pale Riders. Her fellow Pale Riders were Dani Moonstar and Dead Man Wade.

When one of Apocalypse spies finds out that the X-man Nightcrawler is looking for the mysterious place known as Avalon, a haven for humans, Apocalypse sends Damask and her Pale Riders to find Avalon and wipe it out. Nightcrawler is in search of the precognitive Destiny, who lives on Avalon. To find Destiny, Nightcrawler teams up with his mother, Mystique. The Pale Riders follow them to Avalon. During the trip, Dani amuses herself by torturing Dead Man Wade, whose healing factor instantly restores all the damage she does. Damask gets annoyed by Dani and kills her, enjoying her death.

When they arrive at Avalon (a tropical paradise in the middle of Antarctica), Nightcrawler and Mystique meet up with the mutant known as Switchback and with Destiny and her adopted son Douglas Ramsey. Destiny reveals that she has a vision of Avalon on fire. Damask and Wade follow Nightcrawler and his friends, but when Damask sees the beauty of Avalon, she begins to doubt her mission. Wade hates all that lives though and attacks the group, only to be quickly dispatched by Damask and Nightcrawler. Damask tells the group that she never knew that life could be like it is on Avalon and that she wants to join them. Nightcrawler, Mystique, Switchback and Damask form a group, which Nightcrawler calls X-Calibre after the caliber of bullets in Mystique's guns. The group is determined to take Destiny back to the X-Men before the future Destiny saw becomes true. Damask also kisses Nightcrawler, curious if his skin does feel like velvet.

X-Calibre is then attacked by another one of Apocalypse's servants, the Shadow King himself, who possesses various inhabitants of Avalon in quick succession, turning them against their friends and loved ones. He then possesses Mystique. Nightcrawler, Damask and Switchback combine their powers to kill the Shadow King, but he makes another mutant kill Douglas with the last of his strength. With Douglas dead, Destiny is convinced that Apocalypse must be stopped and travels with X-Calibre back to New York.

Damask did not appear in the 2005 "Age of Apocalypse" series, nor was she mentioned in it.

==Powers==

Miss Steed possesses the ability to create chained blades of psionic energy that can attack and disable a person's mind. These blades seem to appear from the area around her head, and although visible, are not corporeal weapons. This ability has been referred to as psionic skinning.

She is also resistant to telepathic abilities.
