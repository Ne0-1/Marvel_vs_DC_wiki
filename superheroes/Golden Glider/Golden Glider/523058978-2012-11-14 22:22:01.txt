==Fictional character biography==
Lisa Snart is a [[figure skater]], known by the alias Lisa Star, who has help in her career from her secret coach and lover, [[Top (comics)|The Top]], a foe of Flash [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] who dies from complications of duelling with the scarlet speedster.  Furious over his death, Snart vows revenge. She adopts an orange ice-skater's costume, a mask, and [[ice skates]] which create their own ice flow, allowing her to effectively skate on air. She also has diamonds and jewels that can be used as explosives or hypnotic devices. The Golden Glider seeks revenge against the [[Silver Age of comics|Silver Age]] Flash for several years. She frequently collaborates in her heists with her brother, who is very protective of her.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After the death of Barry Allen, Snart retires from crime (she blames Allen himself for the Top's death, not his successor [[Wally West]]). She and her brother embark on a career as mercenaries, forming the Golden Snowball Recovery Company.

Eventually she returns to crime, with a series of partners, all code-named "Chillblaine", whom she supplies with a replica of her brother's cold gun. The last of these- described as more intelligent and ruthless than his predecessors- kills Snart with the weapon she gave him before holding Keystone for ransom with the aid of [[Doctor Polaris]], with Flash only just managing to defeat them. Chillblaine is then himself killed by Captain Cold in retaliation.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #1, she is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. She and her fellow Black Lantern Rogues attack [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]],<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (February 2010)</ref> but Cold is able to maintain control of his emotions of grief long enough to destroy the Black Lantern Glider.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (March 2010)</ref>

===The New 52===
In this timeline of ''[[The New 52]]'', Lisa Snart's murder has been written out of continuity and she is alive again. Unfortunately she is now dying of a brain tumor.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #6 (April 2012)</ref> She survives after the tumor is removed, but expresses shame over her brother's actions.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #7 (May 2012)</ref> Later, she mysteriously appears in [[South America]], now going by the name "Glider" and apparently wielding metahuman abilities. She is shown recruiting [[Weather Wizard]] for some unknown purpose after his battle with the Flash.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #10 (August 2012)</ref>She also recruits [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Trickster (comics)|The Trickster]] and [[Mirror Master]] to join her faction to extract revenge on Flash,<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #11 (September 2012)</ref> but is stopped with the help of [[Pied Piper]], and her brother.<ref>''The Flash annual''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Golden Glider is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] level [[figure skating|figure skater]].  Thanks to a pair of experimental skates that create their own ice, she is able to skate on any surface, including mid-air.  She invented or acquired (depending on the item) a number of jewel-themed gadgets and weapons, such as poisoned rings or hypnosis jewels, and used these to great effect in her crusade against the Flash.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Alternate versions==
===Flash Annual===
Glider and one of her Chillblaines are featured as one of the villains draining Wally of his speed. Despite being slowed, Wally defeats the pair and leaves them for the police.<ref>''Flash Annual'' (vol. 2) #4 (1991)</ref>

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Lisa Snart and her brother, Leonard were being brutally beaten by their own father. Later, Lisa killed her father with a gunshot and was arrested for the crime.<ref>''Flastpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Lisa is taken to [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]] and is then kidnapped by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. Citizen Cold arrives to try to rescue her, but finds she has been killed by the Rogues member Fallout.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

===Teen Titans Go!===
A teen version of Golden Glider named '''Ice Kate''' appeared in an issue of ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' as part of a supervillain duo consisting of herself and her brother, '''Kid Kold'''. The two villains were defeated by [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] and [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]] after a botched robbery.<ref>''Teen Titans Go!'' #53 (May 2008)</ref>
