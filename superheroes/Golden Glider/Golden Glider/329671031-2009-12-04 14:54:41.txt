==Fictional character biography==
Lisa Snart is a [[figure skater]], known by the alias Lisa Star, who has help in her career from her secret coach and lover, [[Top (comics)|The Top]], a foe of Flash [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] who dies from complications of duelling with the scarlet speedster.  Furious over his death, Snart vows revenge. She adopts an orange ice-skater's costume, a mask, and [[ice skates]] which create their own ice flow, allowing her to effectively skate on air. She also has diamonds and jewels that can be used as explosives or hypnotic devices. The Golden Glider seeks revenge against the [[Silver Age of comics|Silver Age]] Flash for several years. She frequently collaborates in her heists with her brother, who is very protective of her.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After the death of Barry Allen, Snart retires from crime (she blames Allen himself for the Top's death, not his successor [[Wally West]]). She and her brother embark on a career as mercenaries, forming the Golden Snowball Recovery Company.

Eventually she returns to crime, with a series of partners, all code-named "Chillblaine", whom she supplies with a replica of her brother's cold gun. The last of these kills Snart before holding Keystone for ransom. Chillblaine is then himself killed by Captain Cold in retaliation.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #3, she is revived as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. In ''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1, she and her fellow Black Lantern Rogues attack [[Iron Heights]] prison.

==Powers and abilities==
The Golden Glider is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] level [[figure skating|figure skater]].  Thanks to a pair of experimental skates that create their own ice, she is able to skate on any surface, including mid-air.  She invented or acquired (depending on the item) a number of jewel-themed gadgets and weapons, such as poisoned rings or hypnosis jewels, and used these to great effect in her crusade against the Flash.<ref name="dc-ency"/>
