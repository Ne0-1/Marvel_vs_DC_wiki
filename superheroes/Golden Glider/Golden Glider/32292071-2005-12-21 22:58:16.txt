'''Golden Glider''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillian]], sister of [[Captain Cold]] and enemy of [[The Flash]]. She first appeared in ''Flash #250'' (June 1977).

Lisa Snart was a [[figure skater]] who had help in her career from her coach, [[Top (comics)|The Top]], who then became her lover until his death. Furious over the murder of her lover (which she blamed on [[Barry Allen]]), Snart vowed revenge. She wore an orange ice-skater's costume, a mask, and [[ice skates]], which created their own ice flow, allowing her to effectively skate on air. She also had diamonds and jewels she could use as explosives or hypnotism. Glider faced of against the [[Silver Age of comics|Silver Age]] Flash for several years. She frequently teamed up with her brother in her heists, and he was very protective of her. 

Lisa was highly aggresive and violent, in contrast to the cooler head of [[Captain Cold]]. She frequently cut her victims very badly with her skates, even slashing their throats, killing them. After the death of Barry, she retired from crime (she blamed Allen himself for the Top's death, not his successor [[Wally West]]). She and her brother formed the Golden Snowball Recovery, using their abilities as mercenaries.

Eventually she was killed by [[Chillblaine]], and was avenged by Captain Cold.

During the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', rumors persisted that she was the mother of the new [[Captain Boomerang]], but these turned out to be false (the actual mother was [[Meloni Thawne]], who was also the mother of [[Bart Allen]]).
