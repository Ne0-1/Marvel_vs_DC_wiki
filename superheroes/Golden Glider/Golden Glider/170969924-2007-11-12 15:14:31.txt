'''Golden Glider''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], the sister of [[Captain Cold]] and an enemy of [[The Flash]]. She first appeared in ''Flash'' #250 (June 1977).

==Fictional character biography==
Lisa Snart is a [[figure skater]] who had help in her career from her secret coach, [[Top (comics)|The Top]], who then became her lover until his death. Furious over the death of her lover (which she blames on [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]), Snart vows revenge. She adopts an orange ice-skater's costume, a mask, and [[ice skates]] which create their own ice flow, allowing her to effectively skate on air. She also has diamonds and jewels that can be used as explosives or hypnotic devices. Golden Glider sought revenge against the [[Silver Age of comics|Silver Age]] Flash for several years. She frequently teamed up with her brother in her heists, and he was very protective of her. 

Lisa is highly aggressive and violent, in contrast to the cooler head of [[Captain Cold]]. She frequently cuts her victims very badly with her skates, even slashing their throats, killing them. After the death of Barry Allen, she retired from crime (she blamed Allen himself for the Top's death, not his successor [[Wally West]]). She and her brother form the Golden Snowball Recovery, using their abilities as mercenaries.

Eventually she returns to crime, with a series of "dumb muscle" partners (the Chillblaines) she supplies with a replica of her brother's cold gun. The last of these proved smarter than he appeared, and kills her in ''Flash'' vol.2 #113 (May 1996) 
before holding Keystone for ransom. Chillblaine is then killed by Captain Cold in retaliation.

During the events of ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', rumors persisted that she was the mother of the new [[Captain Boomerang]] ([[Owen Mercer]]), but these turned out to be false (the actual mother is [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Bart Allen]]).

==Powers and abilities==
Golden Glider is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] level [[figure skating|figure skater]].  Thanks to a pair of experimental skates that create their own ice, she is able to skate on any surface, including mid-air.
