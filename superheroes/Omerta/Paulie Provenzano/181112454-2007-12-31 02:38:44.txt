'''Omerta''' ('''Paul "Paulie" Provenzano''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is featured in the [[Eve of Destruction (comics)|Eve of Destruction]] story arc in Uncanny X-Men.

==Fictional character biography==

Paulie first appears in the [[Eve of Destruction (comics)|Eve of Destruction]] storyline, beginning in Uncanny X-Men #392.

After just being discharged from the [[United States Army]], '''Paul Provenzano''' returns to his home in [[Brooklyn]], where he attempts to take over the local 'chapter' of the [[Mafia]]. The three leaders, whom Paulie has known all his life, were meeting in a local bakery, a mob-owned business. The leader declared he would not be popular if he made a "made man" out of a mutant. Paulie explains he was taking over. At first they were amused by his declarations, then they shoot him. Paulie easily resists their bullets, then brutally injures the men. 

[[Jean Grey]] surprises and lectures him on the seeming waste of using his powers to take over the local mob. Paulie correctly guesses that she is here to recruit him into the X-Men and agrees to join, if only to see her in her costume. Jean's intention is to recruit Paulie for a mission to [[Genosha]], to rescue the rest of the [[X-Men]] from [[Magneto]].

Jean briefly leaves Paulie to enter the X-Mansion while she talks with [[Sunpyre]] on the front driveway. Paulie is thrown through the front doors moments later. [[Northstar (comics)|Northstar]] follows. Paulie protests, revealing his homophobia and Northstar protests as he is gay. Paulie dares Northstar to hit him, as he, Paulie is invulnerable. Northstar's super-speed is enough to stun, but not hurt him.

During the trip Genosha, Paul and teammate [[Wraith (Hector Mendoza)|Hector Mendoza]] receive a telepathic 'crash course' in their mutant powers, allowing them better control and understanding.  Moments later Paul suggests that he and Jean enter the cargo bay for 'privacy'. As a rebuttal, she makes him perceive her as elderly and overweight, an unpleasent visial. He also participates in a telepathic jaunt into Dazzler's mind, to see what had recently ravaged the dimension she had arrived from. The attackers were child-like versions of the alternate reality [[Age of Apocalypse]] villains. This Paulie is one of the few people in current continuinty to have an inkling of what had gone on in said alternate reality. 

During their battle with Magneto, Paulie creates a diversion for his teammates when he taunts Magneto himself. Magneto shoots Paulie into space, where Northstar saves him. This prompts a later apology. After the battle, Paulie left the [[X-Mansion]] and went off to do his own thing.

It is unknown if Omerta retained or lost his mutant powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities==
Omerta has invulnerability and superhuman strength.
