'''Zzzax''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'' #166 (Aug. 1973) and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Herb Trimpe]].

==Fictional character biography==

Zzzax, "the Living Dynamo" is a [[humanoid]] creature that was formed from [[electricity]] by an act of sabotage at a [[Consolidated Edison|Con Ed]] [[nuclear power|nuclear power plant]] in New York City. A group of terrorists used explosives, and in destroying the dynamos started a chain reaction that caused a rapid build in energy. The energy escaped and absorbed several engineers working at the plant. By using the electrical energy from their brains, it was able to achieve humanoid form and [[sentience]].

Calling itself Zzzax, the creature fights the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the hero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], but is swiftly defeated. <ref>''Hulk'' #166 (Aug. 1973)</ref> A short time later, a team of three scientists at Soul-Star Research Center in Chicago revived Zzzax; it absorbs one of them. The Hulk fights Zzzax once again, which gives the remaining two scientists time to shut down the process and stop Zzzax. <ref>''Hulk'' #183 (Jan. 1975)</ref> Zzzax, however, regenerates and eventually pursues the two scientists, bringing it into conflict with the hero [[Luke Cage]]. Zzzax is defeated, but not before another scientist is killed. <ref>''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #47 (Oct. 1977)</ref>

Several years later, Zzzax reforms when a faulty Soul-Star generator power core is installed at the Northwind Observatory for the Hulk's alter ego, Bruce Banner. Now in full control of the Hulk, Banner uses his knowledge of Zzzax to defeat the creature without any casualties. <ref>''Hulk'' #285 (July 1983)</ref> Zzzax is later restored by the demonic entity [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to battle the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the entity known as the [[Beyonder]]. <ref>''Secret Wars'' II #7 (Jan. 1986)</ref> Zzzax then teams with [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]] villains [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], [[Quantum (comics)|Quantum]], and [[Halflife (comics)|Halflife]] in a battle with Hawkeye and the [[West Coast Avengers]]. <ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #12 - 13 (Sep. - Oct. 1986)</ref>

When Zzzax is eventually contained by the spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], General [[Thunderbolt Ross]], a long-time foe of the Hulk, arranges for his mind to be transferred into Zzzax's body in a tactical experiment. Ross is able to dominate Zzzax's mind and it fights against a new Hulk, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], but returns to his own body when confronted with the fact that he had threatened innocent lives as Zzzax. Zzzax's power is relinquished by Ross shortly afterwards to save his daughter [[Betty Ross Banner]]. <ref>''Hulk' #325 - 327 (Nov. 1985 - Feb. 1986) & #330 (May. 1986)</ref> Zzzax is restored again twice after this, but is defeated by the hero [[Iron Man]] <ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #8 (Apr. 1989)</ref> and is contained again years later by the mutant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. <ref>''Cable'' #59 (Oct. 1998)</ref>

Although captured and imprisoned in "[[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]]," a  facility for super-villains, Zzzax is freed in a mass breakout staged by the villain [[Electro (comics)|Electro]]. <ref>''New Avengers'' #1 - 3 (Jan. - Mar. 2006) + ''New Avengers: Most Wanted Files'' #1 (July 2006)</ref> While recaptured by S.H.I.E.L.D., Zzzax escapes a containment unit and turns the [[Helicarrier]]'s defense systems against its agents. The heroine [[She-Hulk]] manages to recapture Zzzax in a modified stasis box, where the creature currently remains trapped. <ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 4, #17 (Apr. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a being of pure electricity, Zzzax can absorb and discharge vastly powerful currents of electricity, manipulate nearby electrical fields, and fly. The creature's size and strength level also increases in relation to the amount of electricity absorbed. This control of electrical current also extends to the human nervous system, as Zzzax has been shown to be capable of controlling even the Hulk. Zzzax is also dependent upon electricity from the human brain to survive, and when killing prey will temporarily take on the personality traits of the victim. In more recent times, Zzzax has been shown as being capable of generating intense heat, to the point whereby water - a previous weakness - evaporates before touching it. As another recent addition, it was shown capable of inhabiting and controlling the [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] Helicarrier.
