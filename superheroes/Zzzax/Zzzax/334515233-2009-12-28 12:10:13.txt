==Powers and abilities==
As a being of pure electricity, Zzzax is capable of absorbing and discharging powerful currents of electricity; manipulating nearby electrical fields and equipment, and [[flight]]. The character's size and strength level increases in relation to the amount of electricity absorbed. This control of electrical current extends to the human nervous system, as Zzzax has been shown to be capable of controlling even the Hulk. Zzzax is also dependent upon brain electricity, and when killing prey will temporarily take on the personality traits of the victim. Zzzax has been shown as being capable of generating intense heat, to the point whereby water - a previous weakness - evaporates before touching it.
