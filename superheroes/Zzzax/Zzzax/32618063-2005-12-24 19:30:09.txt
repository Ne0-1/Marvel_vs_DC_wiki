'''Zzzax''' (sometimes spelled '''Zzaxx''') is a [[fictional character]], an [[elemental]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  It (or "he") first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #166.
==Character biography==
Zzzax is a [[humanoid]] creature that was formed from [[electricity]] by an accident at a [[Consolidated Edison|Con Ed]] [[nuclear power plant]].  It absorbed the electricity from the [[brain]]s of a group of humans, and thus gained [[sentience]].  A remorseless killer, Zzzax has often come into conflict with the Hulk. Though composed of energy, Zzzax is an intelligent being usually capable of speech and thought.

Although Zzzax has been believed destroyed on several occasions, it inevitably reforms itself. On one occasion, the Hulk's long-time [[Literary antagonist|antagonist]] General "Thunderbolt" Ross, had his mind transferred into Zzzax's body; he was able to dominate Zzzax's mind, though Ross was killed afterwards.  (Ross was later returned to life on several occasions.) It was once teamed up with a group of [[fundamental force]]-themed villains ([[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], [[Quantum (comics)|Quantum]] and [[Halflife (comics)|Halflife]]) in a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].  

It was recently imprisoned in "The Raft", a [[prison]] for supervillains, where it was freed by the electricity-manipulating [[Electro (comics)|Electro]].

==Powers and abilities==
Zzzax is a creature of pure electricity (or to be more precise a psionically charged electromagnetic field in humanoid form).  It can generate electricity (usually in the form of [[lightning]] bolts), manipulate nearby electrical fields, and fly.  Zzzax absorbs electricity from the [[human]] [[brain]] to survive; this usually kills its victims, and usually gives Zzzax temporary personality traits similar to those of the person it has absorbed.  Only his foe the Hulk has proven immune to this ability.  

Although Zzzaxx is a being composed of energy, what passes as its corporeal form is able to lift matter as a normal humanoid body (as though it had hands, muscles, and a skeletal structure). Zzzax possesses the ability to lift in excess of 100 tons or more based on its level of energy it has aborbed at the time. Zzzaxx has nearly limitless stamina and durability due to the quasi-physical nature of its body. It is capable of hovering its body in the air, but it does not achieve a velocity any faster than that of an ordinary human of its size who was running or walking at the same speed on level ground. 

When the energy that composes Zzzaxx' quasi-physical body is dispersed or nullified it somehow always reforms itself. Zzzaz is extremely difficult to restrain or damage.
