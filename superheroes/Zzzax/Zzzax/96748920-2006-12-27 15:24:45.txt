'''Zzzax''' (sometimes spelled '''Zzaxx''') is a [[fictional character]], an [[elemental]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  It (or "he") first appeared in ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #166 (1973).
==Fictional character biography==
Zzzax, "the Living Dynamo" is a [[humanoid]] creature that was formed from [[electricity]] by an accident at a [[Consolidated Edison|Con Ed]] [[nuclear power plant]]. Zzzax was created by a group of radical terrorists, when they sneaked into an electrical power plant and threw bombs at the generators, trying to destroy government control over New York City. The dynamos exploded and started an unexpected chain reaction within the atomic chamber. A new type of fusion took place and multiple balls of energy started to form and expand. The rampant energy absorbed several engineers working at the plant and the electrical energy that resides in the human brain allowed the energy to take a living shape. It absorbed the electricity from the [[brain]]s of that group of humans, and thus gained [[sentience]]. 

A remorseless mass murderer, Zzzax has often come into conflict with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Although composed of energy, Zzzax is an intelligent being usually capable of speech and thought. Although Zzzax has been believed destroyed on several occasions, it inevitably reforms itself. It was first defeated by the Hulk, with the assistance of the Avenger known as [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] (Incredible Hulk #166). Zzzax was soon after revived by a team of advanced electronics research project scientists (Stan Landers, Mark Revel, and Alexandria Knox) at Soul-Star Research Center in Chicago, and claimed the life and personality of one of their own (Landers). The Hulk again faced Zzzax, giving the two surviving scientists (Revel and Knox) the opportunity to dispose of the energy creature (Incredible Hulk #183). However, Zzzax still lived and sought revenge. The creature next battled [[Luke Cage]] in its pursuit of Revel and Knox. This confrontation resulted in Revel's death and ultimately the disappearance of Zzzax for some time (Luke Cage, Power Man #47).

A few years later, Zzzax returned, when a faulty Soul-Star generator power core was purchased by [[Tony Stark]] for [[Bruce Banner]]. The unit was hastily installed by [[Scott Lang]] at Banner's newly-constructed Northwind Observatory. Banner was now in full control of the Hulk and used his knowledge of how Zzzax was defeated in the past to once again channel the energy creature away, this time without any casualties (Incredible Hulk #285). Zzzax later was restored, to attend the most massive army of super-villains ever assembled by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to battle the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], attempting to destroy the [[omnipotent]] being known as the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder]] (Secret Wars II #7). The revived Zzzax then teamed up with a group of [[fundamental force]]-themed elemental villains ([[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], [[Quantum (comics)|Quantum]] and [[Halflife (comics)|Halflife]]) in a battle with Hawkeye and his [[West Coast Avengers]] (West Coast Avengers #12-13).

On the following occasion of Zzzax's captivity by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the Hulk's long-time [[Literary antagonist|antagonist]] General [[Thunderbolt Ross]], had his mind transferred into Zzzax's body in a tactical experiment by Agent [[Clay Quartermain]]; Ross was able to dominate Zzzax's mind and fought against a new Hulk ([[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]) while he was confronted by Bruce Banner, though Ross was killed shortly afterwards. Ross, ashamed that he'd threatened an innocent trapped family while in the form of Zzzax retreated, and successfully returned to his own body with the monster's electrical energy power still intact. Ross threatened revenge on Banner and Jones, but instead "Thunderbolt" Ross sacrificed his own life to save his daughter [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty]] from the deadly mutant parasite that called itself "Nevermind", unleashing the power of Zzzax, freeing it from his influence as Ross died (Incredible Hulk #325-327, #330). (Ross was later returned to life on several occasions.) 

Shortly after this incident, [[Iron Man]] ran an experiment, which pulled Zzzax out of the air. It overloaded Stark’s generator. Zzzax said that it felt enough power to free itself of the now deceased Ross’ influence. It said that once again it is Zzzax. It "thanked" Iron Man for his help by zapping him. Iron Man attempted to blast back, but his blast just passed through Zzzax. Iron Man created several holograms so he could think of what to do. Iron Man tried to siphon Zzzax into his armor as energy. Zzzax started to take control of the armor, but Iron Man managed to expel it before it could. Zzzax walked off leaving Iron Man without power. It searched for more power but for some reason walked right by the generator Stark often used to recharge his armor. Iron Man threw a metal cable through Zzzax. Then Iron Man used liquid nitrogen on the cable. He touched the ends of the cable together to short out Zzzax (Marvel Comics Presents #8).

The energy creature was eventually resurrected yet again, this time by a rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent to battle the mutant hero [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who managed to take out the weakened Zzzax with spraying water (Cable #59). 

Zzzax was recently imprisoned in "The Raft", a [[prison]] for supervillains, where it was freed by the electricity-manipulating [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] (New Avengers #1-3). The current status of Zzzax is unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Zzzax is a creature of pure electricity (or to be more precise a psionically charged electromagnetic field in humanoid form).  It can generate electricity (usually in the form of [[lightning]] bolts), manipulate nearby electrical fields, and fly.  Zzzax absorbs electricity from the [[human]] [[brain]] to survive; this usually kills its victims, and usually gives Zzzax temporary personality traits similar to those of the person it has absorbed.  Only his foe the Hulk has proven immune to this ability. However, even the Hulk himself is susceptible to the ability of Zzzax to override the nervous systems of those he encounters, thereby gaining physical control of his opponents and victims bodies.

Although Zzzax is a being composed of energy, what passes as its corporeal form is able to lift matter as a normal humanoid body (as though it had hands, muscles, and a skeletal structure). Zzzax possesses the ability to lift in excess of 100 tons or more based on its level of energy it has aborbed at the time. Zzzax has nearly limitless stamina and durability due to the quasi-physical nature of its body. It is capable of hovering its body in the air, but it does not achieve a velocity any faster than that of an ordinary human of its size who was running or walking at the same speed on level ground. 

When the energy that composes Zzzax's quasi-physical body is dispersed or nullified it somehow always reforms itself. Zzzax is extremely difficult to restrain or damage.

Later he was shown to be able to generate heat up to 7500°C. He melted through steel and other metal, was protected from water (as it was evaporating before touched his body) and plants. He even was shown to change sand to glass. He was immune to heat (fire-but not hellfire) that wasn't as high as the on he was generating. Later that ability wasn't shown anymore.

==Other Media==
Zzzax was in the third episode of [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]] cartoon, entitled "Raw Power" which first aired on Sunday, September 22, [[1996]]. Zzzax's voices was performed by three different VAs: [[Michael Bell]], [[Lisa Zane]], and [[Kevin Schon]].

[[Toy Biz]] produced a Zzzax action figure in [[1997]] in the second wave of their Incredible Hulk line based upon this appearance from the animated series.
