'''Rusty Collins''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[Marvel Comics]].

Raised in [[Oklahoma]] by his uncle, Rusty joined the [[US Navy]] at sixteen years of age. His [[mutant]] power, control of fire, manifested itself violently, burning a woman. Rusty was arrested, but set the arresting officer aflame and escaped.

[[X-Factor]] was alerted and captured Rusty, helping him to control his powers. At this time, he formed a relationship with [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], a former [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]].  They both participated in X-Factor's trainee team, the [[X-Terminators]], and after that team's dissolution joined the [[New Mutants]].  They were both later brainwashed into joining the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] and from there were recruited into [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].  Along with several other Acolytes, Rusty died in battle with [[Holocaust (comics)]].
