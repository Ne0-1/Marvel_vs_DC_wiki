'''Russell "Rusty" Collins''', fomerly known as '''Firefist''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Bob Layton]] and [[Jackson Guice]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (first series) #1 (February 1986).

==Fictional character history==
Raised in [[Oklahoma]] by his uncle, Rusty joined the [[US Navy]] at sixteen years of age. His [[mutant]] power, control of fire, manifested itself violently, burning a woman. Rusty was arrested, but set the arresting officer aflame and escaped.

X-Factor was alerted and came to the aid of Rusty, helping him to control his powers. At this time, he formed a relationship with [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], a former [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]]. They both participated in X-Factor's trainee team, the [[X-Terminators]]. During the [[Inferno (comics)|Inferno]] storyline, the X-Terminators teamed up with the [[New Mutants]] to help rescue mutant babies from [[N'astirh]], who was usinig them to help keep open a portal to [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]]. At the conclusion of Inferno, Rusty joined the New Mutants, along with [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], [[Rictor]] and [[Meltdown (comics)|Boom Boom]].

Due to a fight with [[Nuklo]] and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], Rusty was brought back into the sights of [[Freedom Force]]. While attempting to escape, he was severely injured by the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]]. While recovering in the hospital, he and Skids were contacted by members of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]]. With soldiers opening fire on them, they felt there was no other choice than to join them.

Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were [[brainwashed]] by [[Stryfe]] into following him blindly. Due to this, Rusty had no qualms about attacking former team mate [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] during the [[X-Cutioner's Song]] storyline. At the end of this story, the Mutant Liberation Front were turned into the authorities.

Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were kidnapped by the [[Friends of Humanity]]. While being transported, [[X-Force]] (the team created by the former members of the New Mutants), rescued them. Arriving back to their base, X-Force was soon confronted by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. He was inviting original New Mutants Cannonball and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] to [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]], a "safe haven" for selected mutants. Cannonball refused to go unless all former New Mutants present (Boom Boom, Rictor, Rusty and Skids) were invited also. While Exodus complained that Rusty and Skids were "damaged" due to their brainwashing, he finally acquiesced.

Upon arriving at Avalon, the mutants were taken to "the Savior" (in reality [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]), who used his powers to undo the brainwashing done to Rusty and Skids. When X-Force arrived to save their friends, Rusty and Skids decided they would stay with Magneto, feeling that they owed him. With thus being done, they joined the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].

Shortly after the [[Age of Apocalypse]] storyline, a mutant body ([[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]]) was discovered floating in space near Avalon. It was brought on board. While on guard duty watching over the thought-to-be frozen body, Rusty's life force was drained by Holocaust, killing him. His last appearance was ''[[X-Men]]'' #42 (July 1995).

==Appearance in other media==

A much younger version of Rusty was featured in an episode of [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]]. There he was an orphan whom [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] met while visiting his old orphanage in Nebraska. Rusty was finding it hard to control his pyrokenetic powers. A man known as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]],  offered to help and adopted Rusty seemingly out of charity. In reality, Kilgrave, a mutant himself with telepathic abilities, wanted to use Rusty's and several other mutants' (Skids included)powers to take over as governor. Scott was able to snap Rusty and the others out of Kilgrave's hypnotic brainwashing in the end.
