==Fictional character biography==
Rusty Collins was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Raised by his uncle, Rusty joins the [[US Navy]] at sixteen years of age. His [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power, generation of fire, manifests itself violently, burning a woman. Rusty is arrested, but sets the arresting officer aflame and escapes.

X-Factor is alerted and comes to Rusty's aid, helping him to control his powers.<ref name="X-Factor #1 February 1986">''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986)</ref> He comes to live with X-Factor,<ref name="X-Factor #1 February 1986"/> who are slowly gathering a small team of mutant wards. Rusty forms a relationship with [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], a former [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #16 (May 1987)</ref>

For a time, they all lived upon [[Ship (comics)|Ship]], a sentient being in the form of a long, rectangular spacecraft that towered over all other Manhattan skyscrapers. Rusty and the X-Terminators help X-Factor when an old booby-trap activates, threatening Ship's brain with a gigantic bomb. Ultimately, the bomb explodes harmlessly far above Manhattan.<ref>''X-Factor'' #28 (May 1988)</ref>

===Inferno===
During the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] storyline, Skids and the other wards, taking the name [[X-Terminators]], the name their mentors used when traveling in their mutant guises, teamed up with the [[New Mutants]] to help rescue mutant babies from [[N'astirh]], who was using them to help keep open a portal to [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref>''X-Terminators'' #1-4 (October 1988-January 1989), ''The New Mutants'' #72-73 (February–March 1989)</ref>  Rusty himself had gone back into custody at the Navy but willingly goes with the group when he realizes his younger friends, [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] and [[Artie Maddicks]] have been captured by demonic forces.<ref>''X-Terminators'' #1 (October 1988)</ref>  At the conclusion of Inferno, with Artie, Leech and the even younger kidnapped children involved rescued from the demons, Rusty joins the New Mutants, along with Skids, [[Rictor]] and [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]].<ref>''The New Mutants'' #76 (June 1989)</ref>

Rusty and Skids help out when long time New Mutants member [[Danielle Moonstar]] loses control of her mystical powers. During the incident they are separated from the rest of the group. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s [[Freedom Force (comics)#Mystique's Freedom Force|Freedom Force]] attacks them at Liberty Island. Part of this conflict involves the ultimate fate of the children Rusty helped rescue; he believes that Freedom Force had wrongfully taken them into custody.<ref>''New Mutants'' #80</ref>

Due to a fight with [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Rusty is brought back into the sights of Freedom Force. While attempting to escape, he was severely injured by the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #86 (February 1990)</ref> While recovering in the hospital, he and Skids were contacted by members of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]]. With soldiers opening fire on them, they felt there was no other choice than to join them.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #87 (March 1990)</ref>

===Brainwashed===
Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were [[mind control|brainwashed]] by [[Stryfe]] into being two of his soldiers. During this, Rusty is part of a MLF strike team sent to a museum to steal an ancient artifact. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], the man who took over the New Mutants soon after Rusty left, is there. Cable slays MLF member [[Sumo (comics)|Sumo]]. He attempts to kill the rest of the group but only gets two of them in the arm, Rusty included.<ref>''Cable: Blood and Metal'' #1 (October 1992)</ref>

Due to the brainwashing, Rusty had no qualms about attacking former teammate [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] during the [[X-Cutioner's Song]] storyline.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #15 (December 1992)</ref> At the end of this story, the Mutant Liberation Front are turned over to the authorities.

Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were kidnapped by the [[Friends of Humanity]]. While being transported, [[X-Force]] (the team created by the former members of the New Mutants), rescued them.<ref>''X-Force'' #24 (July 1993)</ref> Arriving back to their base, X-Force was soon confronted by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. He was inviting original New Mutants Cannonball and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] to [[Providence (comics)|Avalon]], a "safe haven" for selected mutants. Cannonball refused to go unless all former New Mutants present (Boom Boom, Rictor, Rusty and Skids) were invited also. While Exodus complained that Rusty and Skids were "damaged" due to their brainwashing, he finally acquiesced.<ref>''X-Force'' #25 (August 1993)</ref>

Upon arriving at Avalon, the mutants were taken to "the Savior" (in reality [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]), who used his powers to undo the brainwashing done to Rusty and Skids. When X-Force arrived to save their friends, Rusty and Skids decided they would stay with Magneto, feeling that they owed him. With thus being done, they joined the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].<ref>''X-Force'' #25</ref>

When a mutant body belonging to [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], a "survivor" from the [[Age of Apocalypse]], was discovered floating in space near Avalon it was brought on board. While on guard duty watching over the thought-to-be frozen body, Rusty's life force was drained by Holocaust, killing him.<ref>''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #42 (July 1995)</ref>

===Return===
Rusty is resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XFv3i21">''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #21, January 2010</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Rusty Collins is a mutant with the psionic ability of pyrokinesis.  He could control and manipulate fire as well as turn some or all of his body into flames.  He was immune to the effects fire had on his body but normal clothes would ignite.

==In other media==
===Television===
* A much younger version of Rusty was featured in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "No Mutant is an Island". There he was an orphan whom [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] met while visiting his old orphanage in Nebraska. Rusty was finding it hard to control his pyrokenetic powers. A man known as [[Purple Man|Killgrave]], offered to help and adopted Rusty seemingly out of charity. In reality, Killgrave, a mutant himself with telepathic abilities, wanted to use the powers of Rusty, [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Rictor]], and [[Taki Matsuya|Whiz Kid]] to take over as governor. Cyclops was able to snap Rusty and the others out of Killgrave's hypnotic brainwashing in the end.
