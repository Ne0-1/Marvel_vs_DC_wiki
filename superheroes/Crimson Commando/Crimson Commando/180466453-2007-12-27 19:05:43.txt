'''Crimson Commando''' ('''Frank Bohannon''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. His first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #215.

===Fictional character biography===
Frank Bohannon was born somewhere in [[Massachusetts]]. As the Crimson Commando, he was one of a trio of World War II veteran super-heroes recruited to be a member of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], the original government-sponsored mutant team. Earlier, along with his partners, [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], Bohannon had become a vigilante who captured criminals, released them and hunted them in [[Adirondack State Park]] in upstate New York. The trio killed the criminals, both to reduce the criminal element in society and for the enjoyment of hunting them.

The trio captured Pamela Morrison, a drug dealer, and mistaking [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] (the leader of the [[X-Men]]) for a criminal, the trio hunted and captured her as well. The women were set out for the vigilantes to hunt both to their deaths.  The Crimson Commando killed Morrison, but [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] arrived to help Storm. When Storm and Wolverine eventually defeated the trio, Stonewall and Crimson Commando agreed to turn themselves in to law enforcement authorities and confess their vigilantism.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #215-216</ref> Stonewall, Crimson Commando, and Super Sabre (who had been presumed dead) agreed to join [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], a U.S. government sponsored team of superhumans, in exchanged for a commutation of their sentences.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223</ref>

On his first mission with Freedom Force, he fought the X-Men in Dallas, and battled cavemen transported to Dallas by time-waves created by the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]]. He watched a telecast of the X-Men's deaths in order to defeat the Adversary, and then witnessed the return of [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to Dallas without the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225-227</ref> While still in Dallas, Freedom Force also contended against the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #65</ref>

Crimson Commando was also a part of the Freedom Force mission to attempt capture [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], who defeated Freedom Force.<ref>''X-Factor'' #30-31</ref> He also assisted the team's attempt to capture [[Rusty Collins]], which was thwarted by the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #78</ref> With Freedom Force, he also pursued [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who had escaped federal custody.<ref>''New Mutants'' #88-89</ref>

Crimson Commando would be gravely wounded during a bungled mission in the [[Middle East]].  Freedom Force was sent to Kuwait City to rescue or kill physicist Reinhold Kurtzmann, but they encountered the Arabic super-team called [[Desert Sword]]. Teammate Super Sabre was killed, while the Crimson Commando's right hand was severed by the "cutting wind" of [[Aminedi]].<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #7</ref> Bohannon' was mortally wounded,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #15</ref> and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] was forced to abandon [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] in the desert to save his life.  Bohannon was evacuated from Kuwait for hospitalization.<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref>

===Cyborg X===
The Crimson Commando next appeared having been turned into a cyborg going by the name of Cyborg X.  He had been rebuilt by CARE LABS but a testing accident had caused him to malfunction bringing him into a confrontation with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]. Cyborg X would later assist Spider-Man in battling the [[Sinister Six]] but was believed to have been killed in an explosion at CARE LABS.<ref>[[Erik Larsen]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] had originally turned Crimson Commando into a cyborg in order to include him in a proposed [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] re-launch in the mid 1990s that eventually went to [[Peter David]].  Larsen would later use his design to create [[SuperPatriot]]</ref>.

===Project: Wideawake===
[[Image:CrimsCommando.jpg|left|thumbnail|Commando.]]
Now going by only the name Commando, Bohannon next appeared on a mission for [[Project Wideawake]].  He was teamed-up with his former Freedom Force teammate [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] to infiltrate the reclusive [[Empyrean (comics)|Empyrean]]'s headquarters and put his operation out of commission.  They were also ordered by a rogue government official to assassinate [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].

Commando was not seen for quite some time after this, but did appear in the reality-altered [[House of M]] storyline. He was serving as one of Magneto's royal guards, and looked much as he had before becoming a cyborg. His fate after this and [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] is unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Commando is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has the ability to achieve the peak of human physical perfection, although beneath superhuman levels (similar to the physical enhancements granted by [[Captain America]]'s super-soldier treatments). More specifically, his mutation has kept his body at the peak of human physical perfection (though below superhuman levels), and apparently ages at a much slower rate than normal human beings.  He also seemed to have enhanced resistance to injury, managing to survive having his right hand severed and bleeding continuously for an hour, before being maimed by a [[land mine]].  Although he was on the brink of death, Commando managed to hang on long enough to receive medical attention and survive.

He can carry out actions while submerging his conscious thought processes so deeply within this mind that his mind is shielded from telepathic detection. Commando also exhibited some degree of super-vision, able to see his super-fast teammate [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]] when the speedster was moving at superhuman velocities.

Crimson Commando wore a computer and modem device on his wrist, and carried knives, daggers, and conventional handguns as weapons.  He is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant and commando fighter, and his also a highly skilled hunter and tracker.

Since becoming a cyborg, the extent of his abilities is largely unknown. One arm was replaced by a large gun, his legs are now metal and can walk up the side of buildings, and at least one eye was replaced with an optical sensor able to see beyond the range of normal human vision.

==Crimson Commando (Brotherhood of Mutants)==
A young, female, African-American version of the Crimson Commando appeared very briefly as a member of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].  Her name was never stated, and her powers never exhibited, but [[Chris Claremont]] previously stated there would be a new [[Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], [[Mastermind (comics)|Mastermind]], and Crimson Commando.  She only appeared briefly in ''X-Men'' vol. 2, #106.  It is unknown whether she retained her mutant powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].
