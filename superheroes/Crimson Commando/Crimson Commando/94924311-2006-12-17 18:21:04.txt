'''Crimson Commando''' '''(Frank Bohannon)''' is a fictional [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. His first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #215.

==Fictional character biography==
As the Crimson Commando, Frank Bohannon was one of a trio of World War II veteran super-heroes recruited to be a member of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], the original government-sponsored mutant team. Earlier, along with his partners, [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]] and [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], Bohannon had become a vigilante who captured criminals, released them and hunted them in the wilderness of upstate New York. The trio killed the criminals, both to reduce the criminal element in society and for the enjoyment of hunting them.

Mistaking [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] (the leader of the [[X-Men]]) for a criminal, the trio captured and hunted her. When Storm and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] eventually defeated the trio, Stonewall and Crimson Commando agreed to turn themselves in to law enforcement authorities and confess their vigilantism. Stonewall, Crimson Commando, and Super Sabre (who had been presumed dead) agreed to join Freedom Force, a U.S. government sponsored team of superhumans, in exchanged for a commutation of their sentences. 

The Crimson Commando possessed the apparently-trained ability to be able to act without thought, making him impossible to lock-onto psychically.

Gravely wounded during a bungled mission in the [[Middle East]] against the Arabic superteam called [[Desert Sword]], the Crimson Commando was turned into a cyborg and became a solo government operative, renamed Cyborg X and eventually rechristened Commando.

On a mission for Project: Wideawake, Commando teamed-up with his former Freedom Force teammate [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] to infiltrate the reclusive [[Empyrean (comics)|Empyrean]]'s headquarters and put his operation out of commission.  They were also ordered by a rogue government official to assassinate [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].

Commando was not seen for quite some time after this, but did appear in the reality-altered [[House of M]] storyline. He was serving as one of Magneto's royal guards, and looked much as he had before becoming a cyborg. His fate after this and [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] is unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Commando is a mutant whose power is similar to the physical enhancements granted by [[Captain America]]'s super-soldier treatments. More specifically, his mutancy has kept his body at the peak of human physical perfection (though below superhuman levels).  He can also shield his mind from telepathic detection. 

Since becoming a cyborg, the extent of his abilities is largely unknown. One arm was replaced by a large gun, his legs are now metal and can walk up the side of buildings, and at least one eye was replaced with an optical sensor able to see beyond the range of normal human vision.

==The second Crimson Commando==

A young, female, African-American version of the Crimson Commando appeared very briefly as a member of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].  Her name was never stated, and her powers never exhibited, but [[Chris Claremont]] previously stated there would be a new [[Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], [[Mastermind (comics)|Mastermind]], and Crimson Commando.  She only appeared briefly in ''X-Men'' (second series) #106.
