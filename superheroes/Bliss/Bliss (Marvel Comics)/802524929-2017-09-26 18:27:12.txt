'''Bliss''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Her first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #261 (May 1990).

==Fictional character biography==
Bliss was a [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] who became a loyal follower of [[Masque (comics)|Masque]]. She helped Masque wrest control of the Morlocks from [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], and Masque used his powers to make Bliss resemble [[Jean Grey]] (and several other Morlocks to resemble other [[X-Men]]) as part of a revenge scheme against Callisto. She helped capture Callisto, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], and the real Jean Grey to the Morlock tunnels. [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] helped Jean escape, killing Masque's [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] duplicate in the process. Masque then reshaped Bliss as Storm, and chased Colossus and Callisto as part of a mock hunt until the other X-Men intervened; Forge's cybernetic parts were immune to Bliss's bite, and he knocked her unconscious.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #261-263</ref>

===The Extremists===
Much later, Bliss was one of the Morlocks who had retained their mutant abilities after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].  She reappeared alongside Masque as a member of his terrorist group, which included [[Erg (comics)|Erg]], [[Litterbug (comics)|Litterbug]], and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].  Masque was in search of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], hoping to inform him of a prophecy that says mutants may yet come to rule the world. To this end, they assaulted and maimed [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], using Masque's newly developed [[secondary mutation]] that also now allows him to shape-shift himself, and Bliss abducted [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] using her powers. The group then set off a bomb in a packed subway train and Masque used his powers to disfigure the humans on the train. Masque also made a video of why they did it and what is to come and posted it on the internet. The group was ultimately defeated once again by the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #487-491</ref>

===Nation X===
Bliss later appeared as a resident of [[Asteroid M|Utopia]], together with Toad, Litterbug and Dragoness.<ref>''Nation X'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bliss can extend a secondary head atop her tongue from inside her mouth, which carries an anesthetic bite.
