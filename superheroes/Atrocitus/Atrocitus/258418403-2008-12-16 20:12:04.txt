==Fictional character biography==
{{Articleissues|tone=October 2008|in-universe=October 2008}}
===''Green Lantern: Secret Origin===
Long ago, when the rogue [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]] rampaged through space sector 666, Atrocitus was one of only five beings in the entire sector to escape death. He and the other four survivors formed a terrorist cabal known as the Five Inversions, bent on the destruction of the [[Guardians of the Universe]] and all who served them, and with Atrocitus serving as their leader. The Five Inversions performed a ritual which allowed them to peer into the future and discover the prophecy of [[Green Lantern: The Blackest Night|the Blackest Night]], which decreed that all life in the universe would end.

After Abin Sur began making periodic visits to the planet Ysmault, where the Five Inversions were imprisoned after the Guardians destroyed their Empire of Tears, he began to ask questions regarding the Blackest Night. Sur even went so far as to free Atrocitus from his imprisonment so he could lead the Green Lantern to Earth, the birthplace of "the black" that would end the universe. Caged in Sur's starship, Atrocitus instilled fear in Sur, allowing the [[Parallax (comics)|yellow impurity]] to seep into his willpower constructs and weaken them enough to escape. After slashing the Green Lantern in the chest, mortally wounding him , Atrocitus jumped from a point high Earth's atmosphere to escape Sur's failing ship.<ref name="gl29"/>

Atrocitus continued his violent rampage on the planet Earth. After killing an unspecified number of Air Force troopers, Atrocitus recited an oath that will possibly become the battle cry of the Red Lanterns and performed a ritual which gives him the name of the herald of the Blackest Night: [[Black Hand (comics)|William Hand]]. Atrocitus created a device using gun parts which acted as a cosmic divining rod, and used it to lead him to Hand (the device eventually became Hand's criminal weapon). Once he tracked down the human who, it is said, will play a prominent role in the coming of the Blackest Night, he attacked, and planned to take Hand's innards back to Ysmault. Before his plan proceeded, however, Sinestro and rookie Green Lantern Hal Jordan intercepted him, spiriting William Hand to safety. Atrocitus used his newly-constructed device to sap the power from their [[Power Ring (weapon)|rings]], leaving them with only their wits to defend them before the master of the Five Inversions.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #33</ref> Sinestro is able to restore their rings' powers through his power battery, but Atrocitus still has the upper hand. Just as he is about to crush Sinestro with a power shovel, Hal uses his ring to blow up the yellow vehicle, surprising Atrocitus greatly, as he believes Green Lantern rings do not work on yellow. Defeated, Atrocitus is contained by Sinestro, and taken to [[Oa]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #34</ref> He is later returned to Ysmault by Sinestro, where he prophecises that Sinestro's home planet [[Korugar]] would soon erupt into chaos and disorder.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #35</ref> It is implied that it was Atrocitus who planted the seeds of Sinestro's fall from grace.

===''Rage of the Red Lanterns''===
{{main|Green Lantern: The Blackest Night}}
Atrocitus is shown in the aftermath of the ''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'' to be the first to forge a Red Lantern power battery, utilizing  the power of rage.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #28</ref> He said that his first new victim would be the one who called himself "the greatest Green Lantern:" Sinestro, who had long since abandoned the Green Lantern Corps to forge a Corps in [[Sinestro Corps|his own namesake]]. He also murdered Qull of the Five Inversions, a fellow member of the Empire of Tears and the one responsible for telling Abin Sur the prophesy of the Blackest Night (which cause the Guardians of the Universe to continue the Empire of Tears' incarceration on Ysmault, rather than transfer them to Oa's sciencells, closer to the enemies of the Five Inversion). In this way, his Red Lantern power battery was christened with blood.

Atrocitus murders the other members of the Five Inversions, using their blood to create red power rings, power batteries, and a Red Central Power Battery on Ysmault. Atrocitus soon dons his new red power ring, created from the blood of the other members of the Five Inversions, becoming the first Red Lantern. He recruits many other individuals  from across the universe who have great anger and hate, including former Green Lantern [[Laira (comics)|Laira]]. Many of them have been wronged by the Sinestro Corps, and Atrocitus promises them that the Red Lantern Corps will eradicate Sinestro himself. He leads his new corps in an assault against Sinestro while he is being transferred by some members of the Green Lantern Corps to his home planet of Korugar for execution.

The Red Lanterns interupt a deadly fight between Sinestro's forces and the Green Lanterns. The Reds kills both sides without discretion, Atrocitus personally slaying the long-standing Green Lantern Remnant Nod. 

Atrocitus and the Red Lanterns kill both the Sinestro Corps members and the Green Lanterns without discrimination. Sinestro is taken by the Red Lanterns to Ysmault for execution, and Hal Jordan, who faced Atrocitus previously, is left for dead in space.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns'' one-shot (October 2008)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Atrocitus wields a Red Lantern power ring similar to that of a [[Green Lantern]]'s, save that it is powered by rage rather than willpower.

Atrocitus possesses superhuman strength and durability; strong enough to toss a construction digger and durable enough to withstand bullets.  He also possesses some knowledge of mystical rituals.
