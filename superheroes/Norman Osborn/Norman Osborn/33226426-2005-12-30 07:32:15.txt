The '''Green Goblin''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] who is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  The Green Goblin dresses in a garish green costume resembling a [[goblin]] and uses an arsenal of high-tech weapons, notably [[hand grenade|grenade]]-like "pumpkin bombs", and rides on a personal flying device.  The Green Goblin was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964).

==Character biography==
===Norman Osborn===
The original Goblin was '''Norman Osborn''', a corrupt industrialist who co-founded a major [[nanotechnology]] firm with Dr. Mendel Stromm. To seize total control, Osborn had Stromm framed for [[embezzlement]] and then searched his possessions, discovering an experimental intelligence enhancement formula. When Osborn attempted to create the serum, it turned green and exploded in his face. The accident changed Osborn, greatly increasing his intelligence and strength, but also drove him [[insane]].

Osborn adopted the bizarre identity of the Green Goblin with the goal of becoming the Boss of the city's [[organized crime]]. This was intended to be complemented by defeating Spider-Man, a relatively low-powered opponent whom he was confident he could defeat to enhance his reputation. To this end, Osborn created a personal flying device, which started in a broomstick-like shape and evolved into his Goblin Glider, and hand [[hand grenade|grenade]]-like explosive weapons resembling pumpkins, a number of thrown projectile weapons called Razor-Bats featuring sharp blades (much like a certain [[Batman]]'s batarangs), and blaster equipped gloves which fired energy blasts from the finger tips. Thus equipped, Osborn set out to achieve his twin goals, only to be frustrated at every turn by Spider-Man.

Frustrated, Osborn decided to lie low until he was sure his enemy's guard was down. When he was ready, Osborn arranged to have Spider-Man exposed to a special gas designed to suppress his spider sense. With that done, Goblin shadowed him until he learned he was really Peter Parker, and then captured him. In turn, Osborn revealed his own identity to Peter and ranted about his [[origin]] and his intentions of killing his greatest enemy, before releasing Peter to do battle. Peter defeated Osborn, who lost his memory and had his costume destroyed by Spider-Man to eliminate his menace.

For a long while, the Goblin personality periodically re-emerged in Osborn to bedevil Spider-Man, only to be forced down in turn when he was defeated. Finally, the Goblin took control one final time and threatened the love of Spider-Man's life, [[Gwen Stacy]], by [[kidnap]]ping her and taking her to the top of a bridge in [[New York City]]. In the resulting battle, the Goblin pushed Gwen from the bridge and Spider-Man's attempt to save her failed. With blood in his eyes, Spider-Man pursued The Goblin for [[revenge]], but managed to control himself after defeating him in battle. In one final attempt to kill him, the Goblin tried to spear Spider-Man with his remote control glider, only to be himself impaled when Spider-Man avoided the attack. The Goblin was presumed dead for years.

===Harry Osborn===
As it turned out, '''Harold "Harry" Osborn''', Norman's son and Peter's friend, saw the battle and took pains to cover up his father's Goblin identity. Already mentally weakened due to an [[LSD]] overdose, he blamed Spider-Man for his father's death, and upon learning his [[secret identity]], planned his revenge as the second Green Goblin. Peter managed to subdue Harry in battle that left him in police custody. Harry raved to the police that Peter was Spider-Man, but was dismissed as a lunatic. Harry later began a relationship with Liz Allan and married her, having one son, but tragedy eventually took Harry's life when he couldn't let go of his 
Goblin identity and was killed by overusing the serum.

''See [[Harry Osborn]] for more information.''

===Bart Hamilton===
Harry was put under the medical care of '''Dr. Barton "Bart" Hamilton''' who managed to make Harry bury his vendetta and identity as the Goblin in his [[subconscious]]. Unfortunately, Dr. Hamilton wanted to use Harry's secrets to become the third Green Goblin. Eventually, the underpowered amateur was killed and the Goblin menace was buried yet again.

===Hobgoblin===
Later, [[fashion]] designer Roderick Kingsley discovered Norman Osborn's abandoned secret lair and set about to discover the rest of his equipment and records. With much of that accomplished, Kingsley created a variant of the Goblin identity as the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], who plagued Spider-Man for months while manipulating innocents to hide his identity.

===Phil Urich===
Still later, Harry's insanity relapsed and he became the Green Goblin again on numerous occasions, until he died from the side effects of a modified Goblin serum. His equipment and the identity of the Green Goblin was then briefly used by '''Philip Benjamin "Phil" Urich''', who tried to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]], although he sometimes seemed to be as maniacal as his villainous predecessors. When his equipment was damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] Crossover, Phil was unable to repair or replace it and the fourth Green Goblin thereafter retired.

===The Return of the First Green Goblin===
It was revealed that Norman Osborn was still alive and had been manipulating the events of the [[Clone Saga]] behind the scenes. For a while, a genetic construct acted as the fifth Green Goblin following Norman's orders, but it proved unstable and died. 

After the fifth Goblin died, Norman developed a new plan for Spider-Man&mdash;he wanted Parker to become his new heir. His first move in this game was [[drug (disambiguation)|drug]]ging Parker into flying around in the Goblin's costume and attacking his friends. Norman then took Peter to the old Osborn estate to try to convince him to take up Norman's mantle on his own [[will (philosophy)|free will]]. After days of physical and psychological [[torture]], Peter cracked under the stress, but still refused Norman at the last minute. Norman's next plan involved using a drunk [[Flash Thompson]] to drive a truck into Midtown High School, where Peter worked. The accident caused Flash to suffer major [[brain damage]] and enraged Peter enough to decide to finish his feud with Norman once and for all. At the end of the fight, which took place in one of Norman's chemical plants, Spider-Man came close to killing the Goblin, but relented at the last second. Peter told Norman that if he gives into his hatred for the Goblin, the last piece of Gwen would die. Parker left, telling Norman that he was tired of fighting him, and declared a truce.

Recently, however, the Green Goblin's true identity was revealed to the public by a dedicated investigation by the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. After a battle with Spider-Man and [[Luke Cage]] that spanned the length of [[Manhattan]], he was arrested and sent to prison for the first time in the character's 40-year history. 

As could be expected, however, Osborn did not stay in prison for long. Even behind bars, Osborn masterminded a plot to get Spider-Man himself to help him escape, which the web-slinger ultimately did, as payment for releasing [[Aunt May]] from kidnappers on Osborn's pay. After this, Spider-Man battled with the Sinister Twelve, a group of his greatest enemies lead by Osborn as the Green Goblin, who revealed that he had a hand in financing many of these villains' origins. The Goblin slipped away in the heat of the battle and abducted [[Mary Jane Watson]], taking her to the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], but Spider-Man was able to rescue her. The Green Goblin then found himself grappling with a deranged [[Doctor Octopus]], still drugged from being held in police custody. A bolt of [[lightning]] sent the two villains plunging into the river. Doctor Octopus was eventually recovered alive and well, and Peter later received a letter from Osborn, mailed before the fight. Osborn likely survived the battle, is once again at large, and it will likely be only a matter of time until he and Spider-Man clash once again.

It was recently revealed in a controversial storyline that, prior to Gwen Stacy's death, Osborn had engaged in an affair with her, resulting in twins. After Stacy's death, Osborn took the children into his care during his sabbatical in [[Europe]]. The children, named '''Gabriel and Sarah''', aged and matured rapidly after only a few years. The twins emerged after Osborn's takedown and confronted Spider-Man, whom they believed to be their real father. After a series of confrontations, Gabriel discovered his real father's identity, and assumed the mantle of the sixth Green Goblin, or "Grey Goblin." Gabriel, deranged and [[amnesia]]c after a battle with Spider-Man, disappeared along with Sarah.

===Norman "Normie" Osborn, Jr.===
In the [[MC2]] universe, Normie Osborn, the son of Harry Osborn and grandson of Norman Osborn Sr., became the new Green Goblin.  He sought to kill Peter Parker for the deaths of his grandfather and father, but was stopped by Parker's daughter, May, who had become [[Spider-Girl]].  Normie continued to be part of Spider-Girl's rogues gallery, but did not possess the flair of a criminal mastermind like his father or grandfather.  Eventually, he regained his friendship with May and became the new [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]

==Powers and abilities==
Due to the serum he ingested, Norman Osborn possesses superhuman strength comparable to that of Spider-Man. His [[reflex]]es, speed, and stamina are enhanced. His durability has been augmented over the years to the point that bullets fired from most conventional weapons can't pierce his skin. Apparently, a [[.45 Magnum]] at close range can injure him, as Mary Jane realized when she shot him when he tried to kidnap her. However, Osborn is capable of healing from damage that would be lethal to a normal person, having regenerated from being impaled through the chest by his own rocket-glider and later from having over a dozen of his bombs explode while webbed to his chest. This was first used as a plot device to bring Norman Osborn back from the grave. 

He is armed with a variety of bizarre incendiary devices and uses a Goblin Glider as a personal transport. It can reach velocities of well over 300 miles per hour and is extremely maneuverable. 

The Superhero Green Goblin (Phil Urich, nephew of Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich), also had the ability to produce an ear-shattering maniacal laugh that threw off his enemies.

Aside from his physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already highly above average intellect, making him a bona fide [[genius]] capable of making progress in advanced areas of [[genetics]], [[robotics]], [[engineering]], and applied [[chemistry]] that most professional scientists can scarcely comprehend. However, these aptitudes are inhibited by the fact that Osborn is criminally insane.

==Ultimate Green Goblin==
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of the Green Goblin is quite a bit different than the way he is portrayed in the regular Marvel universe. Norman Osborn was partially responsible for the accident that created Spider-Man, and in an attempt to recreate said accident, transformed himself into a literal goblin monster (whereas the original one merely dressed up as one). In his first appearances he was little more than a mute beast, although in later appearances he has evolved to the point where he can change back and forth from human to goblin at will. 

It was later revealed in [[Ultimate Six]] that the Oz chemical was created in hopes of recreating the super soldier formula that made Captain America. The creation of the Ultimate Marvel versions of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] are due to a rival company's attempt to recreate the super soldier formula.

The Ultimate Norman Osborn, much like his [[Earth-616|616 Universe]] counterpart, fathered a child named Harry Osborn.  Unlike the 616 Universe, however, Harry Osborn would not grow up to take the mantle of Green Goblin, but instead became the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Ultimate Hobgoblin|Ultimate Hobgoblin]].

Strangly in the Ultimate Hobgoblin story arc, a shot of the Green Goblin's hideout is seen. Inside there is several masks and costumes, which could point to him being not as organic as he apears. Then again, it could just be a easter egg.

==Other media==
===Animated series===
The 1960s [[animated television series]] featured the first depiction of the Goblin outside of the [[comic book]], but fans have criticized it for getting the character completely wrong. For instance, the Goblin is depicted as a dimwitted robber who is obsessed with [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and the [[supernatural]]. Those were fields of expertise that Norman Osborn in the comics was never interested in (save for one anomalous incident in the late 1990s), preferring to use [[technology]] to commit crimes.

The 1980s series depicted Osborn as something closer to [[Lizard (comics)|The Lizard]] with a serious medical problem of physically and uncontrollably changing into the Goblin, a kind of [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]].

The Green Goblin was a long-term recurring villain in the 1990s ''Spider-Man'' series.  In the series, Norman Osborn and his partner, Wardell Stromm, were coerced into creating a formula for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] that grants superhuman strength.  An unstable reaction resulted during one experiment and Norman disappeared in the explosion, presumed dead. His son, Harry blamed the Oscorp stockholders, J. Jonah Jameson, Anastasia Harding, and Wilson Fisk (the Kingpin) among others, for the death of his father.  Soon a mysterious airborne figure, identifying himself as the Green Goblin, began kidnapping the stockholders one by one.  Harry quickly became the main suspect and was followed by a wary Mary Jane who became kidnapped herself.  Tracking her down, Spider-Man uncovered an underwater base where the Goblin intended to kill everyone he had kidnapped.  Fighting the Goblin, Spider-Man unmasked him, only to discover that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. Amnesia ensued and Norman was unable to remember his dual identity.  The following morning at Oscorp, he announced that he will no longer build chemical weapons.

In ''Goblin War'', Norman Osborn became the Green Goblin again, after being pressured by the Kingpin to reveal the identity of the [[Hobgoblin]], who he had hired before to kill Fisk.  Into the Goblin's possession comes the Time Dilation Accelerator (a device that can open and close dimensional portals, enabling the occupant to travel from different realities, or to one location to the other), and he began plotting the downfall of his enemies again.  

In the next episode ''Turning Point'', the Green Goblin discoveres Spider-Man's secret identity, again kidnappes Mary Jane, now Peter's girlfriend, and lures Spider-man to the George Washington Bridge.  After a fierce battle the Goblin becomes trapped in another dimension when the Time Dilation Accelerator malfunctions, but not before Mary Jane becomes trapped in a wormhole of her own.  Turning Point is a homage to the famous "The Night Gwen Stacy Died"  comic strip classic, replacing Gwen Stacy with Mary Jane.  This episode  inspired a scene in the Ultimate comics, as well as in the 2002 Spider-Man movie.

Remaining faithful to the comics, Norman's son, Harry, makes several appearances as the Goblin, following in his father's footsteps.  Harry proves to be an ineffective fighter though, and, although he gains super strength and the knowledge that Parker, his friend, is Spider-man, is defeated on both occasions.

===Video game appearances===
The Green Goblin appears in the 2002 [[Spider-Man#Video games|Spider-Man]] video game, based on the Spider-Man film. Ultimate Green Goblin briefly appears in the 2005 [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]] video game.

===Live action feature films===
While the Green Goblin has appeared numerous times in the various animated series, the first live action appearance was in the blockbuster feature film ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), which starred [[Willem Dafoe]] as Norman Osborn. Gwen Stacy is not featured in the movie, replaced by Mary Jane Watson as the Goblin's prey. 

[[Image:GreenGoblinMovie.jpg|thumb|Green Goblin, from the 2002 [[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man film]].]] His son, Harry, resents his father's apparent favoritism of his friend Peter Parker. Norman Osborn is a brilliant scientist and businessman who is known for his contributions in nanotechnology. He is the head of Oscorp, a company contracted by the United States military to create a new super-soldier. Osborn, needing to prove his formula is the new technology the military is seeking, experiments on himself and becomes the Green Goblin. The process drives him insane however, and kills his partner, Dr. Mendel Stromm. The military then decides to give the super soldier contract to another company, Tony Stark's (Ironman) Quest Aerospace. As the Green Goblin, Osborn appears and kills several high-ranking military officers who were present at the Quest test. Although Quest Aerospace's prototype was destroyed, the company decided to expand and, in doing so, assumes control of Oscorp on the condition that Norman Osborn step down as CEO.

In retaliation, the Goblin kills the board of directors at the World Unity Festival, thus removing the last threat to his takeover of Oscorp, and inadvertently almost killed Mary Jane Watson. His appearance at the festival also marks the beginning of his animosity towards Spider-Man. Instead of hating his new enemy, however, Norman finds that Spider-Man is the son that he always wanted, strong and intelligent. Spider-Man does not return the Goblin's feelings of respect and rebuffs Osborn's offer of alliance.  

The enraged Green Goblin finds out Spider-Man's identity and he proceeds to injure Aunt May. He then kidnaps Mary Jane and tells Spider-Man that he must choose either to save her or to save a group of children in a cable car. Both are thrown off the [[Queensborough Bridge]], yet Spider-Man manages to save the children and Mary Jane, as opposed to the bridge scene in the comic book, which ended in the death of Spider-Man's sweetheart (Gwen Stacy).

The Green Goblin gets into a final battle with Spider-Man after threatening to torture and kill Mary Jane. After being defeated, the Norman personality resurfaced, asking Spider-Man to forgive him while at the same time secretly directing his flying machine to impale Spider-Man from behind. Spider-Man sensed the attack and dodged, and the machine killed the Green Goblin instead. At the [[funeral]], Harry swears revenge on Spider-Man.

In ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', Harry's obsession with defeating Spider-Man leads him into a brief alliance with Doctor Octopus, an alliance that lead him to the discovery of Peter's secret identity. Harry subsequently [[hallucinate]]d that his father was speaking to him from inside of a mirror, demanding that Harry avenge his death. When Harry shattered the mirror, he discovered his father's hidden Green Goblin costume and arsenal. Whether this means Harry becomes the second Green Goblin (or Hobgoblin) or realizes that his father was a murderous criminal that Peter likely killed in [[self-defense|self defense]] has yet to be revealed.
