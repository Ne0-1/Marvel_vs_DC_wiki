The '''Green Goblin''' is a name shared by several [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s that appear in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 ([[1964#July|July 1964]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. The original and current Green Goblin, '''Norman Osborn''', is Spider-Man's archenemy. After a serum enhanced [[industrialist]] Norman Osborn's physical abilities and intellect but also drove him insane, he adopted a [[Halloween]]-themed appearance, dressing in a [[goblin]] costume and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, notably [[Hand grenade|grenade]]-like "Pumpkin Bombs" while riding on a bat-shaped "[[Goblin glider]]" to terrorize [[New York City]]. The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man related media throughout the years, including [[Spider-Man on television|television series]] and the [[Spider-Man (film series)|''Spider-Man'' films]] in which he is portrayed by [[Academy Award]]-nominated actor [[Willem Dafoe]]. The character was ranked number 19 on Wizard Magazine's Top 100 Greatest Villains Ever list.<ref>Wizard Magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Villains of All Time</ref>

==Publication history==
[[Image:14-1goblin.jpg|thumb|185px|right|The Green Goblin's first appearance; the character originally used a turbo-fan-powered "flying [[broom]]stick." Cover of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14. Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
According to Steve Ditko, the Green Goblin, as we know him, was entirely his creation. He claims: <blockquote>"Stan's synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an [[Egypt]]ian-like [[sarcophagus]]. Inside was an ancient, [[mythology|mythological]] [[demon]], the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan's mythological demon into a human villain."<ref name=Ditko>{{cite | title= "Spider Time" |  author= Will Murray | publisher= Starlog and Comics Scene present Spider-Man and other Comics Heroes|date=July 2002}}</ref></blockquote>

The Green Goblin first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14. His identity was unknown. He proved popular and reappeared in later issues which made a point of his [[secret identity]]. Apparently, Lee and Ditko disagreed on who he should be. According to one theory, Lee always wanted him to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted him to be a stranger, feeling this was closer to real life.<ref>See (among others): Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution'', p. 107 (Bloomsbury, 2004)</ref> Ditko seems to have refuted this rumor, however, claiming: <blockquote>"So I had to have some definite ideas: who he was, his profession and how he fit into the Spider-Man story world. I was even going to use an earlier, planted character associated with J. Jonah Jameson: he [was to] be [revealed as] the Green Goblin. It was like a subplot working its way until it was ready to play an active role."<ref name="Ditko"/></blockquote>

Ditko left the series before he could reveal the Goblin's identity and Lee decided in #39 to identify him as Norman Osborn, a character who had been introduced only two issues earlier, the father of [[Harry Osborn]], introduced in #31. [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalls: <blockquote>“Stan wouldn’t have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn’t reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn't know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn't know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin's identity would have been revealed in Amazing #39 if Ditko had stayed on."<ref>''Comics Creators on Spiderman'', pg 29-30, Tom Defalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref></blockquote>  

Interestingly, Norman Osborn was depicted as a villainous character even before being revealed as the Green Gobin. In his first appearance in issue #37, he was revealed to have framed his partner [[Mendel Stromm]] as a thief, sending him to jail, and was willing to shoot. He vowed to eliminate Spider-Man for interfering with his plans and in #38 he offers a reward to anyone in the underworld who takes out the wall-crawler. It seems apparent that Osborn was going to be used as an [[antagonist]]ic figure to Spider-Man even before being chosen to be the Goblin.

Osborn discovers Spider-Man's true identity in ''Amazing'' #39, but then suffers [[amnesia]] so that the story that revealed the Goblin's origin would also be his last appearance. However, the Green Goblin would come back three times, the third time killing Parker's girlfriend, [[Gwen Stacy]]. This [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|landmark storyline]] shocked comic readers. It had been unthinkable to kill off such an important character &ndash; the protagonist's love interest and a character with a large fanbase. This [[story arc]] is considered one of the markers of the end of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], and the beginning of the darker, grittier [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]].<ref name="Blumberg">{{cite journal

After having the Goblin kill Spider-Man's girlfriend, writer [[Gerry Conway]] decided that the Goblin had to pay a heavy price. In the next issue the Goblin has his final battle with Spider-Man in which he ended up unintentionally killing himself. With Norman killed off, the writers have used others to take the mantle of the Green Goblin, including Norman's son Harry. Writer [[Roger Stern]] decided to create a new goblin and introduced the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy. 

During the [[Clone Saga]], the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter with his clone [[Ben Reilly]] as the regular, true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's archenemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. It was suggested that Harry Osborn, who was killed off in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Spectacular Spider-man]]'' #200, would be revealed to be the semi-[[zombie|zombified]] [[cyborg]] known as "[[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]]". Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life, as the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter Parker into thinking he was a clone, and resuming his identity as the Green Goblin full-time. However, the plotline was nixed by newly promoted Editor-In-Chief [[Bob Harras]], who disliked the Harry Osborn character and instead had Norman be the mastermind and revealing Gaunt as Mendel Stromm.

The decision to resurrect the original Green Goblin was also very controversial; his death was part of "The Death of Gwen Stacy" storyline that was widely considered a classic, but it was deemed necessary by Marvel's then-Editor-in-Chief. Osborn's return led to a brief stint in a [[Lex Luthor]]-like role, minimizing his Goblin identity and leading to "The Final Chapter," which closed out the first volume of ''Amazing Spider-Man''.

==Fictional character biography==
The original Goblin is Norman Osborn, the son of industrialist Ambrose Osborn, born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Although he is a brilliant student in the fields of science, his [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] father loses control of his company, and turns on his family. [[Psychological trauma|Traumatized]], the young Osborn kills the family dog, considering it another mouth to feed.

In college, he studies [[chemistry]] and [[electrical engineering]], and meets his sweetheart Emily, gets married, and eventually has a son, Harry. As an adult, he co-founds a major firm with [[Dr. Mendel Stromm]], Osborn Industries, of which he is owner and president. At some point Emily becomes ill and dies. This tragedy pushes Osborn to work harder, and he barely has time for Harry. Hoping to gain more control of his company, Osborn accuses Stromm of [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] from the company and has him arrested. Osborn then searches his possessions, discovering an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula. When Osborn attempts to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and strength, but at the cost of his [[sanity]].

[[Image:Amazingspiderman39.jpg|left|195px|thumb|Cover of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #39 (Aug, 1966). Art by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]

Osborn adopts the bizarre identity of the Green Goblin, based on a monster he feared in his childhood, with the goal of controlling the city's [[organized crime]]. He intends to cement his position in the city by defeating Spider-Man in order to enhance his reputation. To this end, he creates a personal flying device, which starts in a [[broom]]stick-like shape and evolves into his [[Goblin Glider]]. He also develops [[hand grenade]]-like explosive weapons resembling pumpkins, sharp [[shuriken]]-like Razor-Bats, and gloves which fire blasts of energy from the fingertips. Osborn hires the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] to kill Spider-Man at a bogus [[New Mexico]] movie set. The Enforcers fail, but the Goblin defeats Spider-Man in battle.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14</ref> The Green Goblin then fights Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] to a standstill.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #17</ref>

The Green Goblin continues plaguing the city, only to be thwarted at every turn by Spider-Man. Frustrated, the Goblin decides to lie low until he is sure his enemy's guard is down. When he is ready, he arranges to have Spider-Man exposed to a special gas designed to suppress his spider sense. With that done, Goblin shadows him until he learns he is really Peter Parker, a classmate of his son Harry. After capturing him, Osborn in turn reveals his own identity to Peter and rants about his origin and his intentions of killing his greatest enemy, before releasing Peter to do battle. Spider-Man defeats Osborn and destroys his costume, and Osborn loses his memory.

Throughout the next several issues, the Goblin personality periodically re-emerges in Osborn to bedevil Spider-Man, only to be forced down in turn when he is defeated. In "[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]", the Goblin takes control one final time and threatens the love of Spider-Man's life, [[Gwen Stacy]], by [[kidnap]]ping her and taking her to the top of the [[George Washington Bridge]] in New York City. During the resulting battle, the Goblin commits one of his most brutal crimes: pushing Gwen from the bridge to her death. Enraged, Spider-Man pursues the Green Goblin for [[revenge]], but manages to control himself after defeating him in battle. In a final attempt to kill him, the Goblin tries to spear Spider-Man with his remote control glider, only to be himself impaled by the jet-glider's sharp points when Spider-Man avoids the attack. Norman Osborn is then presumed dead.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #122</ref>

Harry later becomes owner and president of Osborn Industries.

===Escape===
Unknown to Peter, Harry secretly witnessed their fight. After Spider-Man leaves the scene, Harry removes his father's costume before the authorities arrive. He later [[bribery|bribes]] the [[coroner]] into altering Norman's [[autopsy]] so no one will find traces of the Goblin formula in Norman's blood. However, Norman's "death" is not what it seemed. The Goblin formula has given Norman a [[healing factor]] which re-grows his internal organs and reanimates him. Norman wakes up in the morgue and covers his trail by replacing his body with that of a drifter (who he murders) of the same build and facial features. After arriving in time to watch Harry swear revenge on Spider-Man, Norman allows the Goblin legacy to pass to his son and escapes unnoticed into [[Europe]]. While traveling, Norman takes over an international criminal organization named the Cabal of the Scrier. He sends one of his agents to Peter's professor, [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]], and offers to help him with his cloning project which eventually results in the clones of Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker. For seven years, Norman watches Peter from the shadows.<ref> ''Spider-Man: The Osborn Journal'' </ref>

===Return===
After Harry dies from the side effects of a modified Goblin serum, Norman returns to the [[United States]] and, from behind the scenes, begins engineering the series of events that came to be known as the [[Clone Saga]]. He does this in an attempt to drive Peter into despair by convincing him that he is the clone, while the real clone, [[Ben Reilly]], is believed to be the original. After this plot fails, Osborn reveals himself to Peter and subsequently kills Reilly. He also apparently kills Peter's newborn daughter, although the full extent of this is unclear to this day. Norman later loses control of the Scriers and creates a smaller organization left over from the cabal called the Order of the Goblin, where he is given the title of "Goblin Lord".

Upon his return, Osborn comes up with a carefully contrived story to explain his absence and regains control of his business. For a while, a genetic construct that had once been a human being acts as the fifth Green Goblin following Norman's orders, so that he (Norman) will not be suspected as the Green Goblin (despite having admitted in public that he is Norman Osborn, and while wearing the costume).

He also buys the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' so that he can control and edit out any bad publicity, such as the frequent editorials by [[Ben Urich]]. Later, when Norman is driven [[insane]] by the Order of the Goblin's [[mysticism|mystic]] ceremony, the [[gene]]tic construct seeks out Osborn's original formula to stabilize itself and discovers who it truly is. Unfortunately for the construct, its effort comes too late, and in front of Spider-Man's eyes, it melts into a puddle and dies. (The construct was originally intended by [[Glenn Greenberg]] to be Phil Urich, as revenge by Norman for using the gear in the first place, but this was subsequently vetoed by the Spider-Man editor at the time.<ref>[http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/specials/LifeOfReilly/33.html PART 33]</ref><ref>[http://www.comicboards.com/smb/view.php?trd=990604101623 The stand-in Green Goblin revealed!]</ref>)

===Goblin's Heir===
After the fifth Goblin dies, the Green Goblin develops a new plan for Spider-Man - he wants Parker to become his new heir. His first move in this game is [[psychoactive drug|drugging]] Parker into flying around in the Goblin's costume and attacking his friends. Norman then takes Peter to the old Osborn estate to try to convince him to take up Norman's mantle on his own [[will (philosophy)|free will]], tormenting him in an attempt to make him accept the darkness rather than the light. After days of physical and psychological [[torture]], Peter cracks under the stress, but still refuses Norman at the last minute, throwing his serum in his face and fighting with him. Norman nevertheless departs, commenting that he has still won because he managed to break Peter, no matter how briefly, and adds that, in the end, he has always known that one of them would kill the other eventually.

Norman's next plan involves using a drunk [[Flash Thompson]] to drive a truck into Midtown High School, where Peter works. The accident causes Flash to suffer major [[brain damage]] and enrages Peter enough to decide to finish his feud with Norman once and for all. At the end of the fight, which takes place in one of Norman's chemical plants, Spider-Man comes close to killing the Goblin, but relents at the last second. Peter tells Norman that if he gave in to his hatred for the Goblin, the last piece of Gwen would die, and that he does not ''need'' to kill Norman anyway, as simply being himself is punishment enough. Parker leaves, telling Norman that he is tired of fighting him, and declares a truce.

===Exposed===
The Green Goblin's true identity is revealed to the public by a dedicated investigation by the ''Daily Bugle'' after he murders one of their reporters. After a battle with Spider-Man and [[Luke Cage]] that spans the length of [[Manhattan]], he is arrested and sent to prison for the first time in the character's 40-year history. As expected, however, Osborn does not stay in prison for long. Even behind bars, Osborn masterminds a plot to get Spider-Man himself to help him escape, which the web-slinger ultimately does, as payment for releasing [[Aunt May]] from Mac Gargan, [[The Scorpion]], a kidnapper in Osborn's employ; a promise that Osborn later breaks. Spider-Man battles with the [[Sinister Twelve]], a group of his greatest enemies led by Osborn as the Green Goblin, who reveals that he had a hand in financing many of these villains' origins. The Goblin slips away in the heat of the battle and abducts [[Mary Jane Watson]], taking her to the [[George Washington Bridge]], but Spider-Man rescues her. The Green Goblin then finds himself grappling with a deranged [[Doctor Octopus]], still drugged from being held in police custody. A bolt of [[lightning]] sends the two villains plunging into the river. Doctor Octopus is eventually recovered alive and well, and Peter later receives a letter from Osborn, mailed before the fight.

===Sins Past===
{{main|Gabriel & Sarah Stacy}}
It was recently revealed in a controversial storyline that, prior to Gwen Stacy's death, Osborn had engaged in an affair with her, resulting in twins. After Stacy's death, Osborn takes the children into his care during his sabbatical in [[Europe]]. The children, named '''Gabriel and Sarah''', age and mature rapidly within only a few years (due to inheriting Norman's enhanced DNA). The twins emerge after Osborn's takedown and confront Spider-Man, whom they believe to be their real father, and who they believe has murdered their mother. After a series of confrontations, Gabriel and Sarah discover their real father's identity after Peter digs up Gwen's grave for a [[DNA]] sample. Sarah rejects Osborn's vendetta, but Gabriel assumes the mantle of the sixth Green Goblin, or "Grey Goblin". Gabriel, deranged and amnesiac after a battle with Spider-Man, disappears along with Sarah, although she later reappears in [[Paris]]. This explains a great deal to Peter: why the Goblin has killed Gwen, why Mary Jane avoided Peter for a long time, having known the secret, and why Osborn wanted Peter as his 'heir' ("So that we could be One Big Happy Goblin Family").

===Thunderbolts===

[[Image:Tbolts121 cov.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover art for ''Thunderbolts'' #121.<br>Art by [[Marko Djurdjevic]].]]

====Civil War====
{{main|Civil War (comics)|l1=Civil War}}

After escaping to [[Paris]], Osborn is apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents and taken into their custody. While in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Osborn watches in shock as Spider-Man publicly reveals his identity as Peter Parker (also confirming Osborn's identity as the Goblin and his role in Gwen's death in the process), railing that Peter "broke the rules!" He is then approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who are seeking his aid. The Goblin confronts and attacks Ben Urich in an alley, but S.H.I.E.L.D.'s nano-machines cause him to stop, involuntarily making him collapse and foam at the mouth.

Later he makes a deal with a shadowy figure who gives him a serum to override the control nano-machines implanted by S.H.I.E.L.D. In the next two issues, Osborn attacks a group of Atlanteans in his Goblin gear, killing and wounding many. Later, when one Atlantean ambassador attempts to give a speech, Norman appears and shoots at him, wounding but not killing him. As he is being taken away by security, Norman says he is 'sick' and is not in control of his actions. While being interrogated by two officers, Norman becomes increasingly agitated when they question who gave Norman access to the press conference and assisted in smuggling a weapon there. At first, Norman gets angry, threatening to kill the two officers' families, then he becomes more and more afraid until the shadowy figure arrives at which point Norman begs the officers not to let him go, even promising to reveal all he knows to them.

====Director of Thunderbolts====

Norman Osborn is now the government's appointed new director of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and has been prescribed medication to stabilize his personality. He has alternately used diplomacy, force and humiliation to keep the field team in line, and enjoys the status and power he has, as well as his criminal career being quietly swept under the carpet. He remains unbalanced, however, due to his habit of mixing his medication and because Thunderbolt [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] has influenced attendants to switch his medication with [[placebo]]s on alternate days so as to get him fired and take his place. He has also forced the supervillain [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] and his allies to secretly work for him directly.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason in Madness''</ref> As a Director for the [[Commission of Superhuman Affairs]], Osborn was present and involved in a joint CSA/UN tribunal against [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], being aggressively against him and clashing with witness [[Doc Samson]]. <ref>''Iron Man'' (Vol.4) #27-8</ref>

When four [[telepathy|telepaths]] try to destroy the Thunderbolts from the inside, they target Osborn with [[hallucination]]s of his Goblin mask,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref> eventually causing him to break down completely in response to [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]] going rogue. Driven to become the Green Goblin again, he brutally [[assault]]s and [[Crucifixion|crucifies]] Swordsman before being telepathically nudged into murdering the entire Thunderbolt Mountain staff.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #120</ref> He engages [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] in battle, and both knock each other unconscious. When [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] murders the four telepaths in their cells, all of the Thunderbolts return to normal.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>

====''New Ways to Die''====
{{update}}
During the course of the ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'' storyline, the situation changes so that Norman's son, Harry, is revealed to be alive once more and no one (including Norman) knows Spider-Man's secret identity. Norman returns to the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' title in a storyline entitled ''New Ways to Die''.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16246 Comic Book Resources > CBR News: Enemies at the Gates: Wacker Talks “Amazing Spider-Man”<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In addition to calling the Thunderbolts to New York to hunt down Spider-Man, Norman agrees to help New York mayoral candidate Randall Crowne, who got into trouble when [[Ben Urich]]'s newspaper ''Frontline'' revealed that he had been operating an illegal sweatshop. Norman confronts the man who took the photos; Peter Parker. Norman is unable to find a way Parker can contact Spider-man and leaves him. Later while observing a fight between [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]], and Spider-Man, Norman is confronted by [[Menace (comics)|Menace]]. After a short confrontation, Menace spares him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction. As Menace leaves Norman finds Peter Parker's camera and uses it to [[reverse-engineer]] the tracing system allowing the camera to zero on Spider-Man's chest. Norman later uses the captured villain [[Freak (comics)|Freak]] to produce a counter-measure for Anti-Venom, at the same time providing Gargan with a protective Scorpion battle suit that will distribute the cure throughout his body, healing the symbiote faster.

====Secret Invasion====
{{main|Secret Invasion}}
[[Captain Marvel (Khn'nr)|Captain Marvel]], revealed to be a Skrull sleeper agent, attacks Thunderbolt Mountain, but he can't bring himself to kill. Norman Osborn offers him a chance to explain himself, speaking with him in private, and convincing him to leave. Following this, it becomes clear the Thunderbolts - due to Norman forcing the usage of Oscorp technology over Stark Industries products, the latter of which has been deactivated by Skrull agents - are the only team that can reach and defend [[Washington, D.C.]]. Norman successfully manages and directs the team, while personally joining the battle with a machine gun. During the conflict, several Skrulls [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into duplicates of Spider-Man, the sight of whom drives Norman into an apparent [[nervous breakdown]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123</ref> He guns down every one of them, stating the slaughter to be "therapeutic" for him.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124</ref>

After saving the capital city, Norman is able to successfully manipulate the media to promote himself and the team as patriotic heroes, as well as undermining the CSA and his former industrial rival [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], who appeared to retreat in the heat of battle. He subsequently leads the team to New York, joining the final battle.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #125</ref> His heroic status is exemplified when numerous TV cameras capture his gunshot killing the Skrull Queen [[Veranke]]. When the [[President of the United States]] shuts down SHIELD and indicts Tony Stark, Norman is given the role of running the SHRA and the Avengers Initiative. So after he meets with the newly established "Dark Illuminati", consisting of [[Doctor Doom]], [[Namor]], [[Emma Frost]], The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> They have been pulling the strings to help Osborn and them gain control of all governments and business empires, to in fact rule the world as all supervillains crave.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Dark Reign'' One Shot</ref>

====Dark Reign====
{{main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
{{Unreferencedsection|date=December 2008}}
Norman is seen as the earth's greatest hero, allowing him power to rewrite the order of Earth itself. He and his [[Dark Illuminati]] start some drastic changes that will tip the scale against superheroes and towards the side of supervillany. Norman first shuts down S.H.I.E.L.D., claiming it is too corrupted due to Skrull infiltration. He reforms it into H.A.M.M.E.R., putting himself as head and firing Tony Stark. Tony is now seen as a coward and Osborn has him hunted down as a fugitive, making the public declare him the reason for the Skrull Invasion. Norman then shuts down the 50-State Initiative, claiming it was a failed program from the mind of Stark. He creates only one government-sponsored Avengers team to do the job, enter the [[Dark Avengers]].{{issue}}

Osborn next ceases the Thunderbolts Initiative, claiming it has done its job. But in reality he turns the current Thunderbolts team into his and the Dark Illuminati's own black-ops team. With Black Widow II leading it, this team will do the dirty work for them, starting with taking down any and all superhero threats to their plans, and find and destroy Nick Fury who is building a group called the [[Secret Warriors]] to counter them now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is gone. Last but not least, he buys out and takes control of StarkTech, making it now Oscorp. This gives him hundreds of classified documents and tech specs, along with Tony's armada of Iron Man suits. Norman then leaves [[War Machine]] out in the cold, severing his ties to the government and leaving him to fend for himself with nothing but his own armor suit. This forces Rhodes to become a one man army, stopping the various terrorist attacks spanning across the globe, now that the US government under Norman's control does nothing.{{issue}}

==Powers and abilities==
The chemical solution devised by Norman Osborn from a formula originally conceived by Professor [[Mendel Stromm]], that turned Norman Osborn into the Green Goblin, bestowed upon him superhuman agility, strength, speed, stamina and dexterity. Additionally, Osborn has gained a "healing factor" allowing him to quickly heal from lethal bodily damage (for example: being stabbed through the chest by large blades or have several pumpkin bombs strapped to his stomach). Aside from his physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already highly above average intellect, making him a bona fide [[genius]] capable of making progress in advanced areas of [[genetics]], [[robotics]], [[engineering]], and applied [[chemistry]]. 

The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He travels on his [[bat]]-shaped "[[Goblin Glider]]", an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider. The goblin glider is armed with [[heat-seeking missile]]s, [[machine gun]]s and retractible blades. Other weapons the Goblin uses are incendiary [[Pumpkin Bomb (comics)|Pumpkin Bombs]] capable of melting through 3 inches of battleship steel, smoke and gas-emitting bombs with an appearance like a ghost, razor-edged bat-shaped [[boomerang]]s (similar to Batman's baterangs) and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity capable of discharging nearly 1,000 [[volt]]s of electricity. He wears bulletproof [[chainmail]] with an overlapping tunic and cape. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep himself safe from his own gasses.

==Personality==
{{Original research|date=September 2008}}
Like many other comic book [[supervillain]]s, Norman Osborn is an [[megalomania]]c who takes [[sadism|sadistic]] pleasure in harming his foes and innocent people alike. 

In the pages of the Thunderbolts it is revealed that Norman Osborn is severely [[manic depressive]]. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings and at the apex of his mania is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations. As a consequence of Norman Osborn's incredible arrogance, he does not submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced because mental illness is an imperfection in his view and therefor he will not admit he is mentally ill. Not since the formation of the Thunderbolts, has Norman Osborn ever been seen as remotely emotionally stable and even this is tenuous. 

There are many examples of Norman Osborn's highly pronounced superiority complex. He generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, who are unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings, and tends to remind those in close relationships with him that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. For example, when he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that when Spider-Man previously had defeated him, it did not count because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the [[Human Torch]]. He also missed the opportunity to lead the original [[Sinister Six]] because he felt joining the group would be admitting that he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. This was fortunate for Spider-Man because Norman's strategic abilities directing the powers of the six would have guaranteed the death of Spider-Man. 

One of the few examples of the Goblin demonstrating any esteem for others is that he has expressed admiration for Peter Parker's integrity and intelligence, informing him in a letter that he owes Peter a great deal for ensuring that his life is always interesting and encouraging him not to quit the hero business as the world would be a far duller place without him in it. He has shown more respect for Peter than he does his own son, since Peter is a talented, capable and determined individual &mdash; a self-made man like himself &mdash; whereas he sees Harry as a spoiled weakling. 

Osborn has demonstrated that he is highly sadistic. While in prison, a guard once asked for his advice in helping his critically ill wife &mdash; Osborn's advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death. When told by Peter that he could have "cured [[cancer]] by now" had he put his mind to it, he responded by saying "I don't give a damn!" Osborn is also apparently a [[control freak]], for example getting angry at [[Mac Gargan]] for choosing the [[Venom (comics)|Venom symbiote]] over a new Scorpion outfit Osborn built for him, despite Venom being a more useful asset for their purpose of killing Spider-Man.

==Other Goblins==
While Norman is assumed to be dead, several villains and one hero take up the mantle of the Green Goblin:

==== Nels Van Adder ====
It was revealed that soon after Norman had Stromm arrested for embezzlement, he had found only a portion of the notes detailing his partner's serum. Norman tests the incomplete version of the serum on an Oscorp employee named Nels Van Adder, exposure to which, drives Van Adder slowly insane and begins transforming him into a red, demon-like being known as the "Proto-Goblin". Killing several people and blaming Norman for what has happened to him, Adder proceeds to harass and later attempts to kill him before being knocked out a window in Oscorp by Arthur and George Stacy and fleeing into the wild. In order to escape conviction for what he had done to Van Adder, Norman convinces the police that Van Adder had been experimenting on himself, and that he had secretly been trying to help him. Van Adder's current fate remains unrevealed. <ref> ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #-1 </ref> 

As well as endowing Adder with super strength and agility, the Goblin Serum also gave him large claws, talons, fangs, glowing green eyes and near impenetrable skin (capable of withstanding several close range bullet shots).

The Proto-Goblin appears as a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]''.

====Harry Osborn====

====Hobgoblin====
{{main|Hobgoblin (comics)}}
Roderick Kingsley, a [[fashion design]]er, finds information that leads him to one of Norman's many abandoned Goblin caches, full of equipment that he alters and takes up the mantle of the Hobgoblin, looking to become an underworld leader. He resorts to [[brainwashing]] and framing [[Ned Leeds]], a friend of Spider-Man's. He goes into hiding, and another Hobgoblin comes forth. His name is [[Jason Macendale]] and is killed by Kingsley years later. Macendale appears as the Hobgoblin in the Spider-Man 1994 Series and is voiced by Mark Hamill.

==== Demogoblin ====
{{main|Demogoblin}}
Jason Macendale assumed the role of the Hobgoblin, and when he became trapped in Limbo, it was there that his essence became infused with an unnamed demon. After a battle with [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Daniel Ketch]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], Jason realized that he needed to expel the demon from within him. Doing so let loose the being known as Demogoblin who would seek revenge against his former host, Macendale. He later joined forces with Carnage and other villains in an effort to take over Manhattan, which ended in failure. Eventually, Demogoblin meets his death during a battle with Hobgoblin. He is later seen in the nightmares and hallucinations of [[Phil Urich]].

==== Phil Urich ====
{{main|Phil Urich}}

Harry's insanity relapses and he becomes the Green Goblin again on numerous occasions, until he dies from the side effects of a modified Goblin serum. His equipment and the identity of the Green Goblin are then briefly used by '''Philip Benjamin "Phil" Urich''' (nephew of [[Ben Urich]] of the [[Daily Bugle]]), who tries to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]], although he is sometimes seen as being as maniacal as his villainous predecessors. When his equipment is damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crossover, Phil is unable to repair or replace it and the fourth Green Goblin thereafter retires. He later forms the team [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]]. In the [[MC2]] alternate future, he resumes his career as the Green Goblin (see [[#Phil Urich 2|below]]).

==== Gabriel Stacy ====
{{main|Gabriel & Sarah Stacy}}

Gabriel, Norman's and Gwen Stacy's son, became the sixth Green Goblin known as the '''Grey Goblin'''.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #514</ref> Born after Osborn's enhancements Gabriel already had improved physical abilities and aged rapidly. After taking a dose of Goblin serum, Gabriel becomes a physical powerhouse, but goes completely insane, thus becoming the Grey Goblin. After crash landing in a battle with Spider-Man and his twin sister, Gabriel suffers severe amnesia. His sister, Sarah, takes Gabriel to Paris, but he soon escapes.

==== Menace ====
{{main|Menace (comics)}}
As of yet, an unknown supervillain using Goblin technology.

== Other versions ==
{{main|Alternate versions of Green Goblin}}
As a [[fictional character]], the [[Green Goblin]] has appeared in a number of [[Mass media|media]], from [[comic books]] to [[films]] and [[television series]]. Each version of the work typically establishes its own [[continuity]], and sometimes introduces [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. This article details various versions of the Goblin depicted in works including [[Marvel Comics]] [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate line]] and ''[[Earth X]]''.

==In other media==
===Television===
==== Spider-Man (1967) ====
Green Goblin appears in the 1960s [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|animated television series]], voiced by [[Len Carlson]]. Although the Goblin here is depicted as a dimwitted robber who is obsessed with [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and the [[supernatural]] - fields of expertise that Norman Osborn in the comics is never interested in (save for one incident in the late 1990s), preferring to use [[technology]] to commit crimes. He appears in the episodes "The Witching Hour", "Magic Malice" and "To Catch a Spider".

==== Spider-Man (1981) ====
Green Goblin appears in the 1980s ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' cartoon show, which depicts Norman Osborn, voiced by [[Neil Ross]], as something closer to The [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], with a serious medical problem of physically and uncontrollably changing into the Green Goblin, voiced by [[Dennis Marks]]. This version of the character has a niece by the name of Mona Osborn, who had no knowledge of her uncle's double identity. When she was held captive by the Green Goblin, she stated that he looked familiar. He appears in the episodes "Triumph Of The Green Goblin" and "Quest Of The Red Skull".

The solo ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series' version, which ran around the same time, is truer to the original comic book (in which Osborn suffered from amnesia and wore a Goblin costume instead of physically transforming into the Goblin), with the Goblin appearing in "Revenge of the Green Goblin".

==== ''Spider-Man: The Animated Series'' ====
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Goblinani.jpg|185px|left|thumb|Green Goblin as he appears in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]  -->

The Green Goblin appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Neil Ross]]. Unlike his comic counterpart, Norman Osborn here is not an insane version of himself, and has instead developed a [[multiple personality disorder]]. His other personality is the Green Goblin, who acts on destroying everyone who has hurt Osborn throughout his life. In this incarnation, Osborn is a responsible father, inventor, though ruthless businessman, who gets caught up in the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin's]] affairs. Also, unlike the comic book version, who considers his son weak, the animated series' Osborn cares deeply for Harry. 

In the Goblin's debut episode, "Enter the Green Goblin", Norman Osborn is exposed to a gas that greatly increases his physical strength but also drives him insane. The gas also somehow alters the [[Hobgoblin]]'s (who in the animated series came before the Green Goblin, unlike the comics) equipment, which had been created at Oscorp, and Norman dons it, becoming the Green Goblin. He then kidnaps various Oscorp stockholders (including Wilson Fisk (Kingpin) and [[Felicia Hardy]]'s mother) that had tormented Norman. In "Goblin War!", Norman Osborn becomes the Green Goblin again, defeating the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] and stealing his Time Dilation Accelerator, a machine capable of generating portals. In the next episode "Turning Point", the Green Goblin finds out Spider-Man's secret identity, kidnaps Mary Jane, and fights Spider-Man atop the [[George Washington Bridge]]. In the end, the Goblin gets stuck in another dimension, after his glider pushes him through a portal. In "The Return of the Green Goblin", the Green Goblin appears to Harry Osborn, and lures him into becoming the new Green Goblin. In "The Wedding", Green Goblin appears again to convince Harry Osborn to become the Green Goblin again when he hears that Peter Parker and Mary Jane are going to get married, but Liz Allan in the end convinces Harry that his real friends are Mary Jane and Peter, not the Green Goblin. With his connection to Harry broken, Norman Osborn remains trapped in limbo. The Green Goblin makes his final appearance in "I Really, Really Hate Clones", the first part of the two-part series finale, in which he is working for [[Carnage|Spider-Carnage]] and the Kingpin in an alternate reality.

==== ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' ====
A Counter Earth version of the Green Goblin appears in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series voiced by [[Rino Romano]]. This version is actually a hero instead of a villain, mistaking Spider-Man for a villain during their first encounter. Instead of a glider, he wields a backpack that sprouts wings. By the end of his first appearance, after saving Naoko and Shayne Yamada-Jones from one of Venom and Carnage's plans with the help of Spider-Man and after the Goblin lets Naoko and Shayne go, he whispers to himself about calling Naoko his love. It is revealed in the next episode, which the Goblin himself doesn't appear in, that Naoko has a jealous ex-husband who works for the rebellion against the [[High Evolutionary]]. Naoko's ex-husband, who is standing in the shadows by the end of the episode, reveals that he is jealous, suspecting that Naoko and Peter Parker, the man who pays the rent while living at Naoko's home, are having an affair. He punches a wall that bricks fall down thus confirming the Goblin, who has super-strength is indeed Naoko's ex-husband. 

The Goblin's next appears when he finds out that both Spider-Man and Peter Parker are the same person. He also learns that Spider-Man is from the original Earth, and his intentions on Counter-Earth are to rescue John Jameson. But since Jameson, who is working with the rebels against the High Evolutionary, doesn't agree to come and lets Spider-Man go off on his own, the Goblin decides to help by getting a ship the High Evolutionary has, which was originally Spider-Man's. Spider-Man and the Goblin team up with the Rejects, a group of Beastials that the High Evolutionary gotten rid of since they proved useless, and they get to Solaris II, the ship Spider-Man once had. But Spider-Man has more heart and has Solaris II crash into one of the High Evolutionary's towers, which presumably kills the Goblin in the explosion. However, by the series finale, it is revealed he survived the explosion and joined the Rejects. But he leaves them to help Spider-Man and the rebels fight against the High Evolutionary. By the end of the episode, he is one of the characters who run off when thousands of symbiotes spring to Counter-Earth according to Venom and Carnage's plans.

==== ''Spider-Man: The New Animated Series'' ====
Harry Osborn is a main character in this series, which supposedly follows the same canon as the Spider-Man films. Norman Osborn was mentioned in the show on a number of occasions.

==== ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' ====
Norman Osborn appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' (voiced by [[Alan Rachins]]) as the charismatic yet pompous spirited CEO of OsCorp. He expresses disapproval at his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] for his not getting offered for the ESU lab job and telling him to man up to get what he wants. Bent on being the number one in weapons tech, Norman embezzled the designs of [[Vulture (comics)|Adrian Toomes]] and then tipped Big Man on the technology created by TRI-CORP on shipment. As a result, Norman considers Big Man's deal, with him receiving guinea pigs for his illegal experiments in return for the created supervillains to distract Spider-Man from Big Man's operations. Osborn may be deceitful and rude with a dash of ungratefulness, he does show concern for those close to him.

In the 7th episode "Catalysts", the Green Goblin mysteriously appears (voiced by [[Steven Blum]]) and attempted in vain to overthrow the [[Tombstone (comics)|Big Man]] before Spider-Man intervened. After the Goblin caused the accident that warped [[Doctor Octopus|Octavius]]' mind, Norman was suspected by both Spider-Man and the Big Man for being the Green Goblin due to the fact that all the Goblin's actions were somewhat beneficial to him: overthrowing the Big Man (Norman would not have to conduct more experiments) and creating Dr. Octopus in order to obtain the silence of the timid scientist. Bent on finding out the truth after learning the "Globulin Green" vial is missing and tied to his "benefactor", Norman tells Hammerhead he is determined to unmask the Goblin at any cost. However, when it is revealed to Spider-Man that Green Goblin is actually Norman's son Harry, Norman is grieved by the mess Harry has become and pleads Spider-Man not to take him to the authorities. The next day, Norman embarks on a tour to Europe with Harry so he can relax and forget about his addiction to the formula.

The show's version of Norman has the [[Earth-616|mainstream]] version's hairstyle and appearance, but with the personality of the Ultimate version, while the Green Goblin wears a costume similar to his normal counterpart, but with some differences, including the lack of gloves, thick battle boots, a flying cap and a pumpkin that connects a tunic to his costume. He also lacks a bag, with the weapons being stored in the glider like the first film.

====South Park====
Green Goblin appears in an episode of ''[[South Park]]'' in "[[Imaginationland Episode II]]" as a resident of a world with the same name which is divided by a good and bad side. Obviously, the Goblin is on the bad side.

=== Films ===
In the [[Stephen King]] movie ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'', the face of the Green Goblin is prominently displayed on the front of the movie's main villain, a murderous "Happy Toyz Co." truck. 

==== ''Spider-Man'' ====
The Green Goblin's first live action appearance (beyond a 1982 [[television commercial]] for the [[Atari]] video game) was in the blockbuster feature film ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), which starred [[Willem Dafoe]] as Norman Osborn.

[[Image:Greengoblinspidermanfilm2002.png|right|250px|thumb|The Green Goblin, redesigned for the movie ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]''.]]

Dr. Norman Osborn is a brilliant [[scientist]] and businessman/[[industrialist]] who is known for his contributions to [[nanotechnology]]. As in the comics, he has a distant relationship with his son, [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] ([[James Franco]]), who resents his father's apparent favoritism toward his friend Peter Parker ([[Tobey Maguire]]). Norman takes an immediate liking to Peter when he is informed that Parker can understand his work, and later admires Parker's desire to make his own way in the world, rather than accepting Osborn's help. He is the head of Oscorp, a company contracted by the United States military to create a new [[super-soldier]]. Osborn's colleague, Dr. Mendel Stromm, feels it important to reveal to the military official overseeing the project that some of the test subjects have gone insane. Hearing this, Osborn is threatened with a tight deadline. Needing to prove his formula can succeed, Osborn experiments on himself and becomes the Green Goblin. The process drives him insane however, and he kills Stromm. The military decides to give the super-soldier contract to another company, Quest Aerospace, and in revenge, the Green Goblin kills several high-ranking military officers and Quest scientists who were present at the test. Although Quest Aerospace's prototype was destroyed, the company decides to expand and, in doing so, assumes control of Oscorp on the condition that Norman Osborn step down as [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]].

In retaliation, the Goblin kills the board of directors during a festival in [[Times Square]], thus removing the last threat to his takeover of Oscorp, and inadvertently almost killing [[Mary Jane Watson]] ([[Kirsten Dunst]]). His appearance at the festival also marks the beginning of his animosity towards Spider-Man. Instead of hating his new enemy, however, Norman views Spider-Man as the son that he always wanted, and attempts to recruit him to his side.

The Goblin next leads an attack at the ''Daily Bugle'' to question [[J. Jonah Jameson]] ([[J.K. Simmons]]) for the identity of the photographer who takes pictures of Spider-Man. Peter is at the office during the attack and soon shows up as Spider-Man. The Goblin gasses him and takes him to a rooftop, where he offers Spider-Man a partnership and belittles his choice to become a hero, warning that eventually the city will turn against him. This starts to become true when the ''Bugle'' in response to the attack prints a story claiming the Goblin and Spider-Man are allies.

A few days later the Goblin baits Spider-Man into a burning building and asks him if he's decided to join him. When Spider-Man refuses, the Goblin attempts to kill him with razor bats and eventually slips away. Norman finds out Spider-Man's identity when, while visiting his son Harry (who is Peter's roommate) for [[Thanksgiving Day]], he discovers that Peter has an identical wound to one he had inflicted on Spider-Man in the earlier fight. After deducing Spider-Man's identity, he decides to leave though Harry tries to stop him. Norman tells Harry to do what he wants with Mary Jane and then dump her fast, as he believes she is only interested in his money, as his own wife was. After [[hallucination|hallucinating]] that his other persona informs him to attack Spider-Man's heart, he attacks and seriously injures Aunt May, then kidnaps Mary Jane and tells Spider-Man that he must choose either to save her or to save a group of children in a cable car. Both are thrown off the [[Queensboro Bridge]], yet Spider-Man saves both the children and Mary Jane.

After saving the children and Mary Jane, Spider-Man is lured into an abandoned building. Goblin then throws a pumpkin bomb and it explodes in Spider-Man's face, sending him through a brick wall. As the Goblin brutally beats Spider-Man, he tells him how he will kill Mary Jane slowly. Enraged, Spider-Man attacks him, and gains the upper hand. After being defeated in their final battle and with his own personality apparently resurfaced, Norman removes his Goblin helmet to reveal himself to Spider-Man, and asks Spidey to forgive him and protect him from the Goblin persona. At the same time however, Norman (with the Goblin still controlling him) secretly directs his glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Norman states he was like a father to him and begs him to be a son to him, to which Peter retorts that he had a father: his late uncle, [[Benjamin Parker]] ([[Cliff Robertson]]). The Goblin responds by launching his glider.

Spider-Man senses the attack with his spider-sense and dodges, and the machine kills the Green Goblin by [[impaling]] him. Just before dying, Norman begs Spider-Man not to tell his son about his second identity. When Spider-Man takes Norman's corpse back to his mansion, Harry sees him placing his father’s dead body on a bed. Not knowing that his father was the Green Goblin, Harry holds Spider Man responsible for his death. At the funeral, Harry swears revenge on Spider-Man. 

In the film, the Green Goblin pilots a high-tech Goblin Glider, armed with seeking missiles and machine guns. He also wears green armor that cybernetically connects him to his glider and weapons. He is seen using three varieties of his signature "pumpkin bombs": one which is a simple explosive; one that releases a bright, radioactive flash which reduces people to skeletons; and one that splits into flying, razor-bat blades. Rather than carrying a shoulder "bag of tricks", the weapons are contained in the glider and are ejected individually out of their storage compartment when desired. His suit is armed with [[knockout gas]] that is released from the wrists. His suit is also linked to the Goblin Glider, allowing him to control it remotely.

====''Spider-Man 2''====
Willem Dafoe reprised his role of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin briefly in [[Spider-Man 2]]. In the movie, Harry Osborn, obsessed with defeating Spider-Man, forms a brief alliance with [[Doctor Octopus]], which leads him to the discovery of Peter's secret identity. An evil vision of the late Norman Osborn subsequently speaks to Harry from inside of a mirror, demanding that Harry avenge his death. When Harry shatters the mirror, he discovers his father's hidden Goblin lair.

====''Spider-Man 3''====
In [[Spider-Man 3]], [[Harry Osborn]], still obsessed with taking revenge on Spider-Man, has finally taken up the mantle of the New Goblin. When Harry suffers from amnesia and briefly forgets his vendetta, the vision of Norman returns in a successful attempt to sway him back to destroying Peter/Spider-Man by one purpose: "Attack his heart."

===Video games===
* The first video game appearance of the Green Goblin is in the 1982 [[Atari 2600]] ''[[Spider-Man (Atari 2600)|Spider-Man]]'' game. 

* The Goblin was originally meant to appear in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (Game Boy)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' for the [[Game Boy]], but he was replaced by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].

* The Green Goblin is a boss in the ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game|Spider-Man]]'' [[arcade game]]. Though not the final boss, he is often acknowledged as being the hardest.<ref>[http://www.progressiveboink.com/archive/sorcererstone.html Peter Parker & The Sorcerer Stone]</ref>

* The Green Goblin is also a boss in the video game adaptation of ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''  The game features the Green Goblin as one of the many bosses that have to be beaten throughout the game.  

* In 2000's [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], and [[Dreamcast]] game, ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' there is a crane. It has a pumpkin on it, and next to the pumpkin it says "bomb".Spider-Man can enter which contains pumpkin bombs, a Goblin Glider, and a Green Goblin poster inside. This is a reference to the numerous hidden hideouts of the Goblin; the Green Goblin himself does not appear in this game.

* The Goblin appears in the 2002 [[Spider-Man#Video games|Spider-Man video game]], based on the film. Dafoe reprised his role of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin in this game. The game's biggest unlockable is the ability to play through the game as Harry in the Goblin suit and equipment, apparently featuring a Harry who has discovered his father's Goblin gear and is trying to learn more about his father's plans as the Goblin. Because the levels are designed for Spider-Man, certain levels (E.g., the bell tower level) are harder, while some are far easier (Such as the chase sequences). Levels where Spider-Man fights the Goblin feature a second Goblin, with a distorted voice, who claims to have been hired to fight Spider-Man; his true identity is unknown. Harry is voiced by [[Josh Keaton]]. The Goblin's genesis in the game parallels that of the film, with Norman and his scientists attempting to capture Spider-Man in order to study his genetics to perfect their own contracted super soldier serum. After a number of failed attempts to capture Spider-Man using OsCorp robots, Norman subjects himself to the serum and becomes the Green Goblin. In this guise he offers Spider-Man a partnership but is refused (In the Xbox version of the game, he subsequently hires [[Kraven the Hunter]] to go after Spider-Man). Upon seeing a picture of Mary Jane kissing Spider-Man, he abducts her as bait for a final battle with Spider-Man, ending with Norman impaled on his glider much like in the comics and film.

* Ultimate Green Goblin briefly appears in the 2005 ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, where he is voiced by [[Peter Lurie]]. He is held captive by S.H.I.E.L.D. since he is such a dangerous threat, but the villain [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] has sneaked into the headquarters and frees the Goblin, having him go on a rampage throughout New York. Spider-Man confronts the Goblin after he escapes from the [[Latveria]]n embassy, the two fighting throughout the city until the battle ends in a conference house where Spider-Man finally beats Goblin to a pulp, knocking him unconscious. Shortly after the villain's defeat, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by [[Sharon Carter]] arrive in the warehouse and take Osborn back into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody without giving Spider-Man a "thank-you", which upsets the hero. Unlike the original Ultimate Green Goblin, who is in control of his Goblin form, this version is portrayed as being more of the out-of-control monster he was in his debut.

* Ultimate Green Goblin makes a major appearance in the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] exclusive ''[[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]'', released in 2006. He is one of the two playable characters (the other being Spider-Man) and the game is a retelling of his [[origin story|origin]].

[[Image:Goblinfof.jpg|thumb|185px|Green Gobllin as he appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'']]
* Green Goblin appears in the game ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Roger L. Jackson]]. Outside of the opening cinematics, he is among the supervillains brainwashed by Mysterio's Control Amulet. Spider-Man fights him on the helipad at OsCorp's Japanese branch. After being defeated, he joins Spider-Man on his quest to obtain the meteor shards.

* Green Goblin appears in the Nintendo DS version of ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]''. Black Cat informs Spider-Man that Green Goblin is setting up bombs as part of a plot to defeat the symbiotes. In the other versions, the first appearance of the glider-bound armored enemies has Spider-Man mercilessly mocking them for their lack of originality by saying things like, "You're not the Green Goblin or the Hobgoblin, you're just a lousy knock-off!"

* Green Goblin appears in the game ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2: Fusion]]'' as a playable character. <ref>[http://ds.ign.com/articles/890/890441p1.html IGN: E3 2008: Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 Character Announcements<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
