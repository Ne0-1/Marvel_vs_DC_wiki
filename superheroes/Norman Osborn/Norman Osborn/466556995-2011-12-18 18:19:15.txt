The '''Green Goblin''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who appears in the comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 ([[1964 in comics#July|July 1964]]).

Although many characters have taken up this identity, the most well-known is the original Green Goblin, '''Norman Virgil Osborn'''. Norman Osborn was originally an [[business magnate|industrialist]] head of OSCORP and father of Spider-Man's best friend, Harry Osborn, who took a serum which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect but also drove him to insanity. He adopted a [[Halloween]]-themed appearance, dressing in a [[goblin]] costume, riding on a bat-shaped "Goblin Glider", and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, notably [[Hand grenade|grenade]]-like "Pumpkin Bombs", to terrorize [[New York City]]. He is one of [[Spider-Man]]'s most persistent foes, and many consider him to be one of the [[archenemy|archenemies]] of Spider-Man,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.2233.tuesday_q&a~colon~_brian_michael_bendis |title=The ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN writer talks about Spidey's new Amazing Friends and lays the Osborns to rest once and for all &#124; Marvel.com News |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.2581.take_10~colon~_marvel~apos~s_finest_couples |title=Love is in the air as Marvel.com's Secret Cabal picks the greatest Marvel romances of all in time for Valentine's Day &#124; Marvel.com News |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbooks.about.com/od/characters/tp/archenemies.htm |title=Top Ten Comic Book Archenemies&nbsp;– Superhero and Villain Arch-rivals |publisher=Comicbooks.about.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> being directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Spider-Man's life, such as the death of [[Gwen Stacy]] and the [[Clone Saga]]. He is also the lead [[protagonist]] of the company-wide "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline.

The character was ranked number 19 on ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top 100 Greatest Villains Ever list, and 27th on its Top 200 Comic Book Characters list.<ref>Wizard Magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Villains of All Time.</ref><ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/0522089thgreatestcharacters2.html ]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> In 2009, Norman Osborn was also ranked as [[IGN]]'s 13th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/13.html Norman Osborn is number 13 ], [[IGN]].</ref> He also placed #11 on GuysNation's Top Villains of All Time. Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: "Of all the costumed villains who've plagued Spider-Man over the years, the most flat-out unhinged and terrifying of them all is the Green Goblin."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'' (Collins & Brown, 2004), p. 55</ref>

==Publication history==
According to Steve Ditko, the Green Goblin, as we know him, was entirely his creation. He claims: {{blockquote|Stan's synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an [[Egypt]]ian-like [[sarcophagus]]. Inside was an ancient, [[mythology|mythological]] [[demon]], the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan's mythological demon into a human villain.<ref name=Ditko>{{Cite document | title=Spider Time | first= Will |last=Murray | work= Starlog and Comics Scene present Spider-Man and other Comics Heroes|date=July 2002 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>}}

The Green Goblin debuted in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #14. At this time his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his [[secret identity]]. Apparently, Lee and Ditko disagreed on who he should be. According to one theory, Lee always wanted him to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted him to be a stranger, feeling this was closer to real life.<ref>See (among others): Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution'', p. 107 (Bloomsbury, 2004)</ref> Ditko has refuted this rumor, however, claiming: {{blockquote|So I had to have some definite ideas: who he was, his profession and how he fit into the Spider-Man story world. I was even going to use an earlier, planted character associated with [[J. Jonah Jameson]]: he [was to] be [revealed as] the Green Goblin. It was like a subplot working its way until it was ready to play an active role.<ref name="Ditko"/>}}

Ditko left the series with issue #38, before he could reveal the Goblin's identity, and Lee subsequently unmasked him in the next issue as Norman Osborn, a character who had been introduced two issues earlier as the father of [[Harry Osborn]]. [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalls: {{blockquote|Stan wouldn’t have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn't reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn't know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn't know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin's identity would have been revealed in ''Amazing'' #39 if Ditko had stayed on.<ref>''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 29–30, Tom Defalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref>}}

After the Green Goblin killed Peter Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], writer [[Gerry Conway]] decided that the Goblin had to pay a heavy price. Osborn accidentally caused his own death in the course of a fight against Spider-Man. Others, such as Harry Osborn, later adopted the Green Goblin identity, and writer [[Roger Stern]] later introduced the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy.<ref name="Creators">{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1840234229 }}</ref>

During the [[Clone Saga]] storyline, the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter with his clone [[Ben Reilly]] as the true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to use [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], but they felt a more down-to-earth character was needed.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/25/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-174/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed 174], ''Comics Should be Good'' [[Comic Book Resources]], September 25, 2008</ref> It was then suggested that the semi-[[zombie|zombified]] [[cyborg]] known as "[[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]]" be revealed as Harry Osborn, who had been killed in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200. Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a [[plot device]] to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter Parker into thinking he was a clone, and resuming his identity as the Green Goblin full-time. However, the plotline was changed by newly promoted [[editor in chief]] [[Bob Harras]], who disliked the Harry Osborn character, and instead chose Norman be the mastermind, revealing Gaunt as Mendel Stromm. Osborn briefly reprised his original evil businessman role, minimizing his Goblin identity, in the lead-up to "The Final Chapter", which closed out the first volume of ''Amazing Spider-Man''.

===New roles===
Following the "Civil War" story arc, [[Warren Ellis]] began writing ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'',<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=8264 Ellis Gets Thunderstruck: Brevoort talks "Thunderbolts"], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 6, 2006</ref> and Osborn was brought into the title as the director of the team. He was one of several characters offered to Ellis, who picked him because, according to ''Thunderbolts'' editor Molly Lazer, "[t]here was something about Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he’s in the book!"<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 Better Know a Thunderbolt: Green Goblin], [[Newsarama]], December 21, 2006</ref> Ellis admitted not being very familiar with the character, saying, "all I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head. That guy as a [[Donald Rumsfeld]]-like public governmental figure... <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Joe Quesada]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=86724 Updated&nbsp;– Confirmed: Ellis & Deodata On Thunderbolts], [[Newsarama]], June 10, 2006</ref> Lazer confirmed that the new team was answerable to the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], giving him the opportunity to do what he wanted: "He's a free man with a lot of power .... And his agenda, well, it's not that secret. He wants to get Spider-Man."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10602 NUTS AND T-BOLTS: Lazer talks "Thunderbolts"], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 22, 2007</ref>

Writer [[Christos Gage]] took over for the [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in stories,<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=151310 Christos Gage: Taking The Thunderbolts Through The Invasion], [[Newsarama]], March 25, 2008</ref><ref name=monstersmarvels>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16183 Monsters and Marvels: Gage Talks “Thunderbolts”], [[Comic Book Resources]], April 25, 2008</ref> which ended with Osborn taking credit for the defeat of the [[Skrull]]s, after he killed the Skrull queen [[Veranke]].<ref name=si8>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #8</ref> This allowed the character to be placed into an influential position in the aftermath, [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]. Although the dark turn at the end was always part of the plan for the storyline, [[Brian Michael Bendis]], ''Secret Invasion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writer, says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis: "While I was putting it together, Warren [Ellis]'s ''Thunderbolts'' run made it very clear that if one would choose to do so, Norman was on track to head toward this kind of storyline, very organically, very in-character, and very much within the realm of what was going on."<ref name=darkreign>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120805-Bendis-Dark-Reign.html Brian Bendis&nbsp;– Wrapping it All Up & Starting Dark Reign], [[Newsarama]], December 5, 2008</ref> Bendis stated, "Norman's team is made up of people who are outstanding at what they do. These are bad-ass, hardcore get-it-done types. They'll close the door and take care of business, and he's dressing them up to make them something that the people want."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19654 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 22, 2008</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Andy Diggle]] took over the writing of ''Thunderbolts''.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080726-diggle-t-bolts.html SDCC '08&nbsp;– Writer Andy Diggle Takes on the T-Bolts], ''[[Newsarama]]'', July 26, 2008</ref> He introduced new characters to serve as Osborn's [[black operation|black ops]] team, explaining, "Norman selected agents with stealth, infiltration and assassination skills rather than overt flying-and-fighting type powers"<ref name=osbsuptb>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19483 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Thunderbolts], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 9, 2009</ref> and "now that he's reached a higher level, he's reconfiguring the Thunderbolts into something much more covert and much more lethal: his own personal hit squad."<ref name=newsarama120817>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120817-Diggle-ThunderboltsB.html Andy Diggle: The Future of the Thunderbolts], ''Newsarama'', December 17, 2008</ref> Diggle's Osborn is still mad: "To quote the movie ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', he's 'crazy, not stupid.' He's clearly fiercely intelligent and a natural born leader, with the ego and competitive drive to succeed against all odds. He also just happens to be crazy as a shithouse rat." He describes his take on Osborn: "I think the secret to understanding Norman is that he doesn't realize he's the villain. He thinks he's the hero. He truly believes that he deserves public adulation, and it bugs the hell out of him that so-called 'superheroes' are getting it instead of him."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17455 CCI: Diggle and Rosemann Talk "Thunderbolts"], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 27, 2008</ref>

Osborn next starred in the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''Osborn'' that was a tie-in to the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/25/spider-man-big-time/|title=Spider-Man: Big Time Begins, 'Spider-Girl,' 'Osborn' and 'Carnage' Comics Announced|accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref> by writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and artist [[Emma Rios]], looking at the character's life in prison. <!--Rest is unclear: Who made the comment?

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Goblin years===
Norman Osborn, the son of industrialist Ambrose Osborn, was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Although Ambrose was a brilliant student in the fields of science, he was also an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who lost control of his company and was abusive toward his family. In one incident, Ambrose locked Norman in one of the Osborn family's empty estates in an attempt to toughen him. It was in that darkened mansion that Norman felt haunted by a "green, goblin-like" creature that was "waiting to pounce on him."<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #25</ref> All of these events had a severe impact on Norman, planting the seeds of the [[megalomania]]c he would eventually become. Norman would stop at nothing to regain the wealth that his father had lost.

In college, where he studies [[chemistry]] and [[electrical engineering]], Norman Osborn meets his sweetheart Emily, gets married, and eventually has a son who he names [[Harry Osborn|Harry]]. In his adulthood, he co-founds a major firm with his former professor [[Dr. Mendel Stromm]] called Osborn Industries, of which he is owner and president. However, Emily becomes ill and dies when Harry is barely a year old.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #1</ref> This tragedy pushes Osborn to work harder, leading him to emotionally neglect Harry. Hoping to gain more control of Osborn Industries, Norman accuses Stromm of [[embezzlement]] and has him arrested. Osborn then searches Stromm's possessions, discovering an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #40</ref> When Osborn attempts to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities, but also drive him to destructive [[insanity]].

===Enter the Goblin===
[[Image:Amazingspiderman39.jpg|right|thumb| ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #39 (Aug. 1966). Cover art by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]<!--both pencils and inks per GCD-->
Osborn adopts the bizarre identity of the Green Goblin—based on the monster he feared in his childhood—with the goal of becoming boss of the city's [[organized crime]]. He intends to cement his position by defeating Spider-Man. As the Green Goblin, he would bedevil Spider-Man many times but fail to achieve his goal. He first assembled the Enforcers and claimed he was shooting a film about Spider-Man for which Spider-Man would be paid $50,000. Spider-Man battled them in the desert, first thinking they were actors. Finally they battled him in a cave and were defeated. However Spider-Man then was attacked by the Hulk, who was hiding there. Spider-Man hid from the Hulk, then turned the Enforcers over to the police, while the Goblin escaped. Later the Goblin encountered Spider-Man again, but left after the Human Torch got embroiled in the battle. He tried to take over a mob led by 'Lucky' Lobo, and led Spider-Man to their base, hoping the leader would be defeated, but they were defeated and arrested by Spider-Man. Spider-Man battled the Goblin again, but he escaped. The Green Goblin revealed his identity to a criminal called the Crime-Master and vice versa. However a rivalry developed between them. They tried to take over gangs, and the Green Goblin succeeded in knocking out Spider-Man just before he attended a meeting of numerous criminals. Hoping to use this to persuade the gangs to join him, he took Spider-Man in. But Spider-Man recovered and defeated the crooks, but the Green Goblin flew away and the Crime-Master escaped by using gas to delay Spider-Man. Later when the Crime-Master tried to attack the Daily Bugle offices, he was shot by the police. He tried to reveal the identity of the Goblin, but died just before he could. It was then revealed he was 'Lucky' Lobo.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #14, #17, #23, #26–27</ref> Stromm returns and attempts revenge with an army of robots, but apparently dies of a [[heart attack]] after someone apparently tries to shoot him through the window.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37</ref> Osborn discovers that college student Peter Parker, a classmate of Harry's, is Spider-Man after exposing Spider-Man to a gas that weakens his spider-sense with the aid of a gang of ordinary crooks, and allows him to be observed. Osborn captures Parker after knocking him out with an asphyxiation grenade, catching him off-guard at home and concerned for Aunt May. The Green Goblin bound Peter with a steel rope and took him to his waterfront base. He then ties him to a steel chair with the intention of torturing Peter with suspense, revealing his identity to the world, and killing Peter while he is completely helpless and at his mercy. He reveals his true identity and origin to Peter, who stalls Osborn long enough to free one hand. Seeing this, The Green Goblin releases Spider-Man for what he intends to be their climactic battle. Spider-Man defeats Osborn, who loses his memory after being knocked into a mass of electrical wires, and destroys the Goblin costume in the resulting fire.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #39–40</ref>

Osborn is troubled by repressed memories, which he takes as hallucinations, of the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. A presentation on supervillains by [[NYPD]] Captain George Stacy restores Osborn's memory, but after a brief return to his Green Goblin persona, in which he abducts Parker's friends and threatens Parker's elderly [[Aunt May]], he is exposed to one of his own "[[psychedelic]] bombs", inducing another amnesia spell.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #2 (1969)</ref> In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #96, Osborn stumbles upon an old Green Goblin hideout which again restores his memory. The Goblin battles Spider-Man in this and the following two issues, until Spider-Man leads Osborn to see his son Harry Osborn hospitalized, overdosed on drugs. The shock causes Osborn's amnesia to return yet again.

In [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|issue #121]] (June 1973), his memory having been regained, the Green Goblin throws Parker's love, [[Gwen Stacy]], from a tower of either the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] (as depicted in the art) or the [[George Washington Bridge]] (as given in the text).<ref>Saffel, p. 65, states, "In the battle that followed atop the Brooklyn Bridge (or was it the George Washington Bridge?)...." On page 66, Saffel reprints the panel of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121, page 18, in which Spider-Man exclaims, "The George Washington Bridge! It figures Osborn would pick something named after his favorite president. He's got the same sort of hangup for dollar bills!" Saffel states, "The span portrayed...is the GW's more famous cousin, the Brooklyn Bridge. ... To address the contradiction in future reprints of the tale, though, Spider-Man's dialogue was altered so that he's referring to the Brooklyn Bridge. But the original snafu remains as one of the more visible errors in the history of comics."</ref><ref>Sanderson, ''Marvel Universe'', p. 84, notes, "[W]hile the script described the site of Gwen's demise as the George Washington Bridge, the art depicted the Brooklyn Bridge, and there is still no agreement as to where it actually took place."</ref> She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: "It saddens us to say that the [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash effect]] she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her."<ref name=saffel65>Saffel, p. 65</ref> The following issue, the Goblin appears to accidentally kill himself in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man when he is impaled by his Glider.

Years after Gwen's death, it is revealed that Osborn had a [[one-night stand]] with Gwen after she's overwhelmed by his charisma which in turn leads to her pregnancy with his twin children, [[Gabriel and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah]]. Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent her talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself thus becoming his ideal heirs. The only person who knew of their liaison and the existence of their children was [[Mary Jane Watson]], who despises Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before discovering he's the villainous Green Goblin.<ref>The Amazing Spider-Man #509-514 (August 2004 - January 2005)</ref>

The Green Goblin formula endowed Osborn with a [[healing factor]] that allowed him to circumvent his otherwise certain death. Osborn, no longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, escapes from a morgue and goes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed.  He becomes the leader of the Scrier cabal, which he utilizes to carry out revenge on Parker using Seward Trainer, [[Judas Traveller]], the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], and [[Mendel Stromm]], who is now the [[cyborg]]-like Gaunt, as his pawns.

When Parker learns the truth, Osborn kills Reilly, the real clone.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #75</ref>  It is later revealed that he also raises his illegitimate children, Gabriel and Sarah, while in Europe and tells them that Peter Parker is their father and murdered their mother as Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514 (August 2004 - January 2005)</ref>

The returned Osborn devises a contrived story to explain his absence and regains control of his business. He even uses a Goblin stand-in so as not to be suspected of being the Green Goblin. He also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley, the original [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], and initiates a hostile takeover of the latter's corporate empire in retaliation for raiding the Goblin arsenal and identity. Osborn joins a cult hoping to receive great power but instead goes further into madness.<ref>The "Final Chapter" storyline in; ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #32–33, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #440–441, ''Spider-Man'' #97–98 and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #262–263.</ref> Osborn comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #1–3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #466, ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #25</ref> Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken [[Flash Thompson]] to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson [[brain damage]].

''Siege'' #1-4</ref> Osborn knocks out Captain America and tries to escape, but is captured by [[Volstagg]], and is incarcerated in [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] penitentiary, where he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

===Prison break===
Osborn quickly began taking steps to ensure his release from prison, using a 'Green Goblin Cult' he has assembled to stage a break-out with the aid of various corrupt senators so that he could turn himself in after eliminating most of his fellow inmates, creating a new impression of him as a 'champion' of the judicial system that he may use in future.<ref>''Osborn'' #1-#5</ref> He was subsequently broken out of prison when the government attempted to relocate him to another prison in preparation for his trial, despite the efforts of the New Avengers to prevent any such attack, due to most of the men in the prison belonging to his group<ref>''New Avengers'' vol.2 #16.1</ref>. With his followers explaining the public perception of him as a voice for the 'disenfranchised' who do not believe in Captain America's right to take charge, Osborn sets out to assemble a new team of Dark Avengers, concluding that what he has learned in prison will make it far easier for him to use the team 'properly' this time.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol.2 #18</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and weaknesses==
Norman Osborn was turned into the Green Goblin by a chemical solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor [[Mendel Stromm]]. The process granted Osborn superhuman agility, strength, speed, stamina, and dexterity, as well as a "healing factor" that allows him to quickly heal even from such lethal bodily damage as being stabbed through the chest by large blades. In addition to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of [[genetics]], [[robotics]], [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[applied chemistry]]. The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane&nbsp;– defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.

===Weapons of the Green Goblin===
The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He travels on his [[bat]]-shaped "Goblin Glider", an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider equipped with various armaments. Other weapons the Goblin uses include incendiary Pumpkin Bombs, smoke- and gas-emitting grenades resembling ghosts and jack-'o'-lanterns, razor-edged [[boomerang]]-like throwing weapons, resembling bats, and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity at nearly 10,000 [[volt]]s. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof [[mail (armour)|chainmail]] with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses.

====Goblin Glider====
The Goblin Glider's controls and [[microprocessor]] are located behind the head of the glider. The pilot is attached to the glider via [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] clasps on the wings of the glider. It has great maneuverability and is steered mostly by leaning, but manual controls are available behind the head of the glider. The Green Goblin later added radio-linked voice controls to his mask. Its top speed is {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h}}, and it can support about {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}}, though it could lift far more for brief periods. Flying at top speed with a full load and a full fuel tank would deplete its fuel supply in about an hour.

The glider possesses a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher.

====Pumpkin Bomb====
A [[grenade]] used by the Green Goblin, the Pumpkin Bomb resembles a miniature [[Jack-o'-lantern]] and, when thrown ignites almost soundlessly and produces enough heat to melt through a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} thick sheet of steel. The Goblin carries these and a variety of other weapons in a shoulder bag he calls his "Bag Of Tricks". The Green Goblin has a range of other "Pumpkin Bombs" at his disposal, including smoke- and gas-emitting bombs. Some release [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] gases, while others emit a specially created mixture that neutralizes [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-sense for a limited period of time. All of these are covered in a light plastic mantle that flutters like a ghost when thrown.

===Weapons as the Iron Patriot===
During the events of the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]", Osborn created a new identity, the '''Iron Patriot''' (an amalgam of [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]]), to cement his standing as a hero. As the Iron Patriot, he utilized a version of Iron Man's armor. The armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability via a pliable crystalline material with a molecular structure that can collimate into super-hard planes upon the application of an electrical field, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While the original Iron Man armor utilized repulsor technology, Osborn's design does not; Stark destroyed all but one repulsor, and stated that "Oz is too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system. The star shaped Uni Beam projector on his chest, because of its shape, also has a less powerful output than that of the original Iron Man model.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List-Spider-Man'' #1</ref>

===Mental illness and other weaknesses===
Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression. He has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits and in some depictions, multiple-personality disorder. He is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand between him and his objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.

In ''Thunderbolts'' Norman Osborn is shown to be severely [[manic depressive]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #113</ref> This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness.

There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes, transferring blame for his shortcomings to others or claiming that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father. Having become the Goblin, he generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the [[Human Torch]], despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #40</ref> He also missed the opportunity to lead the original [[Sinister Six]] because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual&nbsp;– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively&nbsp;– only to receive the gift of madness instead,<ref>''Spider-Man'' #98</ref> subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians ''wouldn't'' threaten his power<ref>''Siege: The Cabal'' #1</ref> Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals.{{issue|date=January 2011}}

Osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism. While he was in prison, a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife; Osborn's advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death. As director of the Avengers, he allowed Bullseye to continue to function as an Avenger, even after Bullseye allowed over thirty innocent bystanders to be killed during a skirmish with a supervillain.<ref>''Dark Reign: Hawkeye'' #1</ref> As director of H.A.M.M.E.R. he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy, [[Pepper Potts]], was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her Rescue variant of the Iron Man armor.<ref>''Invincible Iron-Man'' #11–12</ref> Because these actions threatened the hero persona he had carefully crafted some in the media began to see him for what he really was, and many of his highly-credible former enemies spoke out against him. His Goblin persona vied for control of his body, as depicted in the January 2010 issue of ''[[Dark Avengers]]'', where he is shown writhing on the floor and imploring, apparently to himself, "Why won't this face come off...?", and finally took over when Osborn was defeated by Iron Man at the end of the "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" arc.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]]. ''Siege'' #3</ref>

The Green Goblin is the main [[antagonist]] in the feature film ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), which starred [[Willem Dafoe]] as Norman Osborn. In the film, Osborn is a leading scientist specializing in cybernetics engineering, and has successfully created the advanced flightsuit and jet-propelled, heavily-armed "glider" later used to wreak havoc as the Goblin. OsCorp's failure, however, in creating an effective "super-soldier" serum for the U.S. Military prompts them to threaten the firm with the loss of their funding. Without enough time to do proper human trials, Osborn tests the procedure on himself, gaining extremely enhanced strength, stamina and reflexes but being driven insane as a side-effect and developing a split personality: his [[id]] emerging as the Goblin. He wields pumpkin-shaped grenades of varying effect and wears a green and purple outfit with a grotesque Goblin-faced mask, and this version of the suit is covered in plated armor and circuitry. Dafoe reprised his role in hallucinatory sequences in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', haunting his son Harry Osborn ([[James Franco]]) with guilt and inferiority.
