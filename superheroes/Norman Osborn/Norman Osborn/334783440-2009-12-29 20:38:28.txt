The '''Green Goblin''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] that appears in stories published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 ([[1964 in comics#July|July 1964]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. Although there have been many people who have taken up this mantle, the most well-known is the original Green Goblin, '''Norman Osborn'''. He is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]], having been directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Spider-Man's life, such as the death of [[Gwen Stacey]] and masterminding the entire [[Clone Saga]]. He is also the lead [[protagonist]] of the [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] series. After a serum enhanced [[business magnate|industrialist]] Norman Osborn's physical abilities and intellect it also drove him insane, he adopted a [[Halloween]]-themed appearance, dressing in a [[goblin]] costume and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, notably [[Hand grenade|grenade]]-like "Pumpkin Bombs" while riding on a bat-shaped "[[Goblin Glider]]" to terrorize [[New York City]]. The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man related media throughout the years, including the [[Spider-Man television series|television series]] and [[Spider-Man (film series)|''Spider-Man'' feature films]]. In the films, he is portrayed by [[Academy Award]]-nominated actor [[Willem Dafoe]]. 

==Publication history==
===Origin===
[[Image:14-1goblin.jpg|thumb|185px|left|The Green Goblin's first appearance; the character originally used a turbo-fan-powered "flying [[broom]]stick." Cover of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14. Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
According to Steve Ditko, the Green Goblin, as we know him, was entirely his creation. He claims: {{cquote|Stan's synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an [[Egypt]]ian-like [[sarcophagus]]. Inside was an ancient, [[mythology|mythological]] [[demon]], the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan's mythological demon into a human villain.<ref name=Ditko>{{cite | title= "Spider Time" |  author= Will Murray | publisher= Starlog and Comics Scene present Spider-Man and other Comics Heroes|date=July 2002}}</ref>}}

The Green Goblin first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14. His true identity was unknown. He proved popular and reappeared in later issues which made a point of his [[secret identity]]. Apparently, Lee and Ditko disagreed on who he should be. According to one theory, Lee always wanted him to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted him to be a stranger, feeling this was closer to real life.<ref>See (among others): Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution'', p. 107 (Bloomsbury, 2004)</ref> Ditko seems to have refuted this rumor, however, claiming: {{cquote|So I had to have some definite ideas: who he was, his profession and how he fit into the Spider-Man story world. I was even going to use an earlier, planted character associated with [[J. Jonah Jameson]]: he [was to] be [revealed as] the Green Goblin. It was like a subplot working its way until it was ready to play an active role.<ref name="Ditko"/>}}

Ditko left the series before he could reveal the Goblin's identity and Lee decided in #39 to identify him as Norman Osborn, a character who had been introduced only two issues earlier, the father of [[Harry Osborn]], introduced in #31. [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalls: {{cquote|Stan wouldn’t have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn’t reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn't know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn't know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin's identity would have been revealed in Amazing #39 if Ditko had stayed on.<ref>''Comics Creators on Spiderman'', pg 29-30, Tom Defalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref>}}

Interestingly, Norman Osborn was depicted as a villainous character even before being revealed as the Green Gobin. In his first appearance in issue #37, he was revealed to have framed his partner in OsCorp Industries [[Mendel Stromm]] as a thief, sending him to jail, and was willing to shoot. He vowed to eliminate Spider-Man for interfering with his plans and in #38 he offers a reward to anyone in the underworld who takes out the wall-crawler. It seems apparent that Osborn was going to be used as an [[antagonist]]ic figure to Spider-Man even before being chosen to be the Goblin.

Osborn discovers Spider-Man's true identity in ''Amazing'' #39, but then suffers [[amnesia]] so that the story that revealed the Goblin's origin would also be his last appearance. However, the Green Goblin would come back three times, the third time killing Parker's girlfriend, [[Gwen Stacy]]. This [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|landmark storyline]] shocked comic readers. It had been unthinkable to kill off such an important character &ndash; the protagonist's love interest and a character with a large fanbase. This [[story arc]] is considered one of the markers of the end of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], and the beginning of the darker, grittier [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]].<ref name="Blumberg">{{cite journal

After having the Goblin kill Spider-Man's girlfriend, writer [[Gerry Conway]] decided that the Goblin had to pay a heavy price. In the next issue, the Goblin has his final battle with Spider-Man in which he ended up unintentionally killing himself. With Norman killed off, the writers have used others to take the mantle of the Green Goblin, including Norman's son Harry. Writer [[Roger Stern]] decided to create a new goblin and introduced the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Return===
During the [[Clone Saga]], the Spider-Man writers were met with a massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter with his clone [[Ben Reilly]] as the regular, true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to have [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] but it was felt a more down-to-earth character was needed.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/25/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-174/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed 174], ''Comics Should be Good'' [[Comic Book Resources]], September 25, 2008</ref> It was suggested that Harry Osborn, who was killed off in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200, would be revealed to be the semi-[[zombie|zombified]] [[cyborg]] known as "[[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]]". Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a [[plot device]] to return Harry to life, as the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter Parker into thinking he was a clone, and resuming his identity as the Green Goblin full-time. However, the plotline was nixed by newly promoted [[editor in chief]] [[Bob Harras]], who disliked the Harry Osborn character and instead had Norman be the mastermind and revealing Gaunt as Mendel Stromm.

The decision to [[comic book death|resurrect]] the original Green Goblin was also very controversial; his death was part of "The Death of Gwen Stacy" storyline that was widely considered a classic, but it was deemed necessary by Marvel's then editor in chief. Osborn's return led to a brief stint in his original "evil" businessman role, minimizing his Goblin identity and leading to "The Final Chapter," which closed out the first volume of ''Amazing Spider-Man''.

===Rise to Power===
The end of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] storyline marked the start of the character's climb to power, which would result in him becoming one of the most important characters in the Marvel Universe{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

Following Civil War, [[Warren Ellis]] took over writing duties on ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'',<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=8264 Ellis Gets Thunderstruck: Brevoort talks "Thunderbolts"], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 6, 2006</ref> and Osborn was brought into the title, as the team director, as he was one of the characters offered to Ellis, and was picked because, according to ''Thunderbolts'' editor Molly Lazer, "[t]here was something about Norman, his instability, and his fixation with Spider-Man that Warren liked, so he’s in the book!"<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 Better Know a Thunderbolt: Green Goblin], [[Newsarama]], December 21, 2006</ref> However, Ellis admitted to not being that familiar with the character "all I remember of the Norman Osborn character was from the Spider-Man reprints my parents used to buy me when I was very young, and Norman Osborn was this guy with a weird rippled crewcut who was always sweating and his eyes were always bulging out of his head. That guy as a [[Donald Rumsfeld]]-like public governmental figure... <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Joe Quesada]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=86724 Updated - Confirmed: Ellis & Deodata On Thunderbolts], [[Newsarama]], June 10, 2006</ref> Lazer confirmed that the new team was answerable to the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], giving him the opportunity to do what he wanted: "He's a free man with a lot of power .... And his agenda, well, it's not that secret. He wants to get Spider-Man."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10602 NUTS AND T-BOLTS: Lazer talks "Thunderbolts"], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 22, 2007</ref> and Osborn became director of the team.

Writer [[Christos Gage]] would then take over for the [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in stories,<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=151310 Christos Gage: Taking The Thunderbolts Through The Invasion], [[Newsarama]], March 25, 2008</ref><ref name=monstersmarvels>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16183 Monsters and Marvels: Gage Talks “Thunderbolts”], [[Comic Book Resources]], April 25, 2008</ref> which ended with Osborn taking credit for the defeat of the [[Skrull]]s.<ref name=si8>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #8</ref> This allowed the character to be moved up into an influential position in the aftermath, [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]].  Although the dark turn at the end was always part of the plan for the storyline, [[Brian Michael Bendis]], ''Secret Invasion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writer, says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis: "While I was putting it together, Warren [Ellis]'s ''Thunderbolts'' run made it very clear that if one would choose to do so, Norman was on track to head toward this kind of storyline, very organically, very in-character, and very much within the realm of what was going on.<ref name=darkreign>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120805-Bendis-Dark-Reign.html Brian Bendis - Wrapping it All Up & Starting Dark Reign], [[Newsarama]], December 5, 2008</ref>

Osborn, as the '''Iron Patriot''', leads the new team consisting of members from the Thunderbolts and other characters.<ref>''[[Dark Avengers]]'' #1</ref> Writer Bendis stated "Norman's team is made up of people who are outstanding at what they do. These are bad-ass, hardcore get-it-done types. They'll close the door and take care of business and he's dressing them up to make them something that the people want".<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19654 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 22, 2008</ref> Meanwhile, [[Andy Diggle]], writer of ''[[Losers (comics)|The Losers]]'', took over the writing of the ''Thunderbolts''<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080726-diggle-t-bolts.html SDCC '08 - Writer Andy Diggle Takes on the T-Bolts], [[Newsarama]], July 26, 2008</ref> and introduced a new team drawing on characters with abilities that make the Thunderbolts into Osborn's [[black operation|black ops]] team, saying that "Norman selected agents with stealth, infiltration and assassination skills rather than overt flying-and-fighting type powers"<ref name=osbsuptb>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19483 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Thunderbolts], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 9, 2009</ref> and "now that he's reached a higher level, he's reconfiguring the Thunderbolts into something much more covert and much more lethal: his own personal hit squad".<ref name=newsarama120817>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120817-Diggle-ThunderboltsB.html Andy Diggle: The Future of the Thunderbolts], [[Newsarama]], December 17, 2008</ref> Diggle's Osborn is still mad: "To quote the movie '[[Speed (film)|Speed]],' he's 'crazy, not stupid.' He's clearly fiercely intelligent and a natural born leader, with the ego and competitive drive to succeed against all odds. He also just happens to be crazy as a shithouse rat," going on to describe his take on Osborn: "I think the secret to understanding Norman is that he doesn't realize he's the villain. He thinks he's the hero. He truly believes that he deserves public adulation, and it bugs the hell out of him that so-called 'superheroes' are getting it instead of him."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17455 CCI: Diggle and Rosemann Talk "Thunderbolts"], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 27, 2008</ref>

===The Pre-Goblin years===
Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin, was the son of wealthy businessman Amberson Osborn.  The Osborn family fortune was established by Alton Osborn, Norman's great-grandfather, a man referred to by his enemies as a "[[robber baron]]".<ref>Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin #2</ref>  There is indication that Norman's childhood was somewhat normal, as he claims to have read comic books and [[H. G. Wells]] as a kid.<ref>Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol. 1 #96</ref>  That did not last, because Norman's father loses almost all of the family fortune that Alton had attained, claiming to have been cheated and that someone had stolen his invention.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #14</ref> Amberson eventually becomes a drunkard, often lashing out at his wife and son because of his own failures. Distraught by the abuse from his father, the young Osborn kills the family dog, considering it another unnecessary mouth to feed.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  Norman was subjected to not only verbal abuse from his father, but psychological abuse as well. On at least one occasion in Norman's childhood, Amberson locked Norman in one of the family's empty estates in an attempt to toughen him. It is in that darkened mansion that Norman is haunted by a "green, goblin-like" creature that is "waiting to pounce on him."<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' Vol 2, #25</ref>  Norman eventually accepts the darkness and it is very likely that the he eventually chooses the guise of the Green Goblin to strike fear in his enemies in the same way he was terrified by the "green, goblin-like" creature of his childhood. All of these events had a severe impact on Norman, planting the seeds of the megalomaniac he would eventually become. He would stop at nothing to regain the family wealth that his father had lost.

Norman attended [[Empire State University|ESU]] for college where he studied [[chemistry]] and [[electrical engineering]] and soon meets the love of his life, Emily.  The two marry and eventually have a son, [[Harry Osborn]].  Emily brought a balance to Norman's life that he had never experienced previously and he loved her greatly.  Tragically, Emily died before Harry turned a year old, leaving Norman a distraught single father.<ref>''Spider-Man Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #1</ref> The loss of Emily caused Norman to re-focus on his plan to attain wealth and power, a decision that left him very little time for Harry.  Norman spoiled Harry with material things from the success of his business, but failed to give him any true parenting.  Norman's ruthless business tactics led him to frame the co-founder of his chemical company, [[Mendel Stromm]], for [[embezzlement]].  Stromm claimed to have only borrowed the money from their account and that he had no intention of stealing it.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1 #40</ref>  Osborn turned Stromm over to the police anyway, leaving Norman the sole owner of the chemical company, Osborn Industries.  Norman then began experimenting on his own employees with some strength enhancing formulae, but he struggled to decipher Stromm's notes.  One such employee, Nels Van Adder, went on a killing spree as the red, demon-like monster called the "Proto-Goblin".  When Van Adder tried to kill Norman at Stromm's private laboratory, Norman is saved by Arthur and [[George Stacy]].<ref>''Peter Parker Spider Man'' minus 1</ref> After the dust settled, Norman found more of Stromm's notes hidden within the structure of his old desk.  He was convinced that this is the remaining information needed to recreate Stromm's work.  Interestingly, Norman's original intent is not to make a strength enhancing formula to use on himself, rather a formula that he could sell for profit to become wealthy.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #40</ref>  However, when Osborn attempted to duplicate Stromm's formula, it turned green and exploded in his face, leaving him in the hospital.  He quickly recovered and soon realized that the explosion had greatly increased his intelligence and strength.  Although given these tremendous gifts, his delicate disposition was tipped and the explosion had cost him his [[sanity]].

===Siege on the underworld===
Since the origin of the Green Goblin was first told as a [[flashback]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man #40'', it is sometimes difficult to discern in [[retconned]] stories whether or not Norman has already been exposed to the exploding green serum that ultimately gives him his powers.  Interestingly, in ''Marvel Knights Spider-Man #9'', Mac Gargan, the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], tells Peter Parker the history of supervillains.  He states that they were created in the forties when the “ruling class”, companies responsible for putting governments into office, desired to keep emerging superheroes at bay, and away from discovering the corruption that they have been utilizing to prevail.  This “divide and conquer” tactic led to contracted supervillains, of which Norman Osborn was one of the favorites, until he went out of control with the Goblin persona.  It is unclear exactly when and how this fits into Norman’s early escapades as the Goblin, but with all of the super-criminal alliances he was forming, it is possible that some of these connections were made through this “ruling class” cabal.<ref name="Marvel Knights Spider-Man #9">''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #9</ref>  

However, one event, which takes place around the time of the events of ''[[Fantastic Four]] #1-4'', could be Norman’s first “post explosion” appearance, and thus marks the beginning of his assault on the criminal underworld.  In this story, Osborn comes into conflict with the still amnesiac and homeless [[Namor]] when he trashes some of the machinery at one of Norman’s businesses.  At this point, Norman already has the public reputation as a ruthless businessman and a close affiliation with the hired goons known as the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]].  When Namor’s companion, an “off the wagon” street vagrant named John, returns to the scene where Namor had trashed Osborn’s property to remove his fingerprints, Norman is there waiting for him.  The Enforcers beat him to within inches of his life in effort to find out who was responsible for these actions against Norman.  John doesn’t rat out Namor and Norman and his crew leave the alcoholic for dead.<ref>''Tales of the Marvels:  Inner Demons''</ref> 

In ''Amazing Spider-Man #10'', Spidey defeats the Enforcers and unmasks [[Frederick Foswell]] as the Big Man.  With the Big Man out of commission, Norman sends the [[Headsman (comics)|Headsman]] to take out Spider-Man, who Norman feels is going to be disruptive to his plans.  Spider-Man defeats the Headsman and the Enforcers as well.  At this point, Norman has the [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], Enforcers, and the Headsman working for him.  He has hired the Scorcher specifically to steal more plans for electronics equipment, turbine engines, and explosives so that Osborn can use them for his desires.  However, Norman is infuriated by the failure of his associates and resolves to handling the problem himself.  Norman is seen having sketched the mask for his Goblin persona.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man #8''</ref>  
Osborn adopts the bizarre identity of the Green Goblin, based on a monster he feared in his childhood.  His arsenal of weapons includes a personal flying device, which starts in a broomstick-like shape and evolves into his [[Goblin Glider]].  He also develops hand grenade-like explosive weapons resembling pumpkins, sharp [[shuriken]]-like razor-bats, and gloves that fire blasts of energy from the fingertips.

The first direct conflict between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin occurs when the Goblin convinces Hollywood movie executive B.J. Cosmos that he can get Spider-Man and they can then make a movie with him. The Goblin enlists the help of the Enforcers for his trap, since they were recently defeated by Spider-Man.   During a "rehearsal", Spider-Man is attacked and the fight interrupts the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who was seeking solitude. The Green Goblin escapes while Spider-Man is distracted by the Hulk and the Enforcers.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #14</ref>  Later, the Green Goblin approaches Lucky Lobo and claims to be able to take out Spider-Man and the Headsman. While Spider-Man struggles against the Headsman, the Goblin easily defeats the Headsman who claims he failed while using technology given to him by the Goblin.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #18</ref>  Spider-Man is unaware that it is the Goblin who has defeated the Headsman.  Later, after defeating a “robo” spidey, the Green Goblin feels he’s ready to challenge Spider-Man and defeat him this time.  He chooses to attack Spider-Man at the first meeting of the Spider-Man Fan Club.  The [[Human Torch]] interrupts the fight, but the Goblin evades him and escapes before being caught.  Spider-Man bails out of the fight because he hears that [[Aunt May]] has suffered a heart attack.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #17</ref>  Soon after, the Green Goblin approaches the [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] and offers an alliance with him as he, the Green Goblin, unites the underworld.  The Scarecrow refuses to be his ally.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #22</ref> The Green Goblin then approaches the gang boss Lucky Lobo and requests that he hand over the leadership of his criminal operations to him.  Lucky refuses. The Green Goblin then exposes Lucky to the public and the police raid Lucky’s establishments.  Spider-Man sees this and he tails the Goblin as he goes after Lucky.  Spider-Man takes down Lucky’s crew and then goes after the Goblin.  The Goblin escapes before being captured by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #23</ref>  

After unsuccessfully taking over Lucky Lobo’s operations, the Green Goblin initiates an alliance with [[the Crime Master]].  The Crime Master agrees to ally himself with the Green Goblin, if the Goblin reveals his true identity to him.  Norman double crosses the Crime Master and exposes himself as [[J. Jonah Jameson]].  During a dedication ceremony, a distraction set up by Norman, the Crime Master’s men attempt to steal a Seismic Ray Device (S.R.D.).  Spider-Man stops them and the Green Goblin intervenes to get the S.R.D.  The Crime Master feels the Green Goblin is settling a personal vendetta, so he tries to kill Spider-Man and the Green Goblin at the same time. The Goblin escapes from Spider-Man and vows to “deal” with the Crime Master who now has the ability to reveal his identity because of his close association with J. Jonah Jameson.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #25</ref>  It is revealed that the true identity of the Crime Master is Nick Lewis.  The Crime Master decides he no longer wants to work with the Green Goblin and that he is going to pursue uniting the underworld on his own.  The Crime Master begins making power moves at known mobs and he even manages to take down Spider-Man, or so he thinks.  The Green Goblin manages to sneak up on Spider-Man and is able to deliver a knockout blow with his glider.  He then takes the unconscious Spider-Man to the collection of gangsters that the Crime Master has assembled in an effort to assert his leadership. The Green Goblin has a chance to unmask Spider-Man but Spider-Man was wearing a cheap second-hand costume (as he had lost the original at this point) which he kept together with webbing. The mask was webbed on and therefore  impossible to remove; he kept up the criminals' faith by claiming “There’ll be time for that later!”<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #26</ref>  With Spider-Man as a captive of the Green Goblin, he swayed a whole room filled with mobsters to follow his lead.  However, Spider-Man soon regains consciousness from the nerve gas he was exposed to and is able to get out of the chains that had bound him.  With the help of the police, Spider-Man is able to subdue the mobsters, yet the Crime Master and the Green Goblin get away.  Soon after, however, the Crime Master is caught and killed by the police before he can reveal the Goblin’s identity.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #27</ref>  The Goblin is now fed up with Spider-Man and his goals switch from uniting the underworld to a personal vendetta with Spider-Man.

===Personal vendetta with Spider-Man and amnesia spells===

[[Image:Amazingspiderman39.jpg|left|195px|thumb|Cover of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #39 (Aug, 1966). Art by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]

After multiple conflicts with Spider-Man, the Green Goblin soon begins to view his foe as a personal rival, and not just an obstacle on his way to controlling the underworld.  The Goblin soon returns from the shadows and stages a robbery in an effort to attract Spider-Man.  During the fight with the robbers, Spider-Man is exposed to a gas, designed by the Goblin, to dull his [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-Sense|Spider-Sense]].  This allows the Goblin to track Spider-Man and obtain his true identity as Peter Parker.  The Goblin then confronts Spider-Man outside his home and the Goblin is able to subdue Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #39</ref>  Back at his waterfront hideout while Spider-Man is restrained, the Green Goblin exposes his true identity as Norman Osborn.  The Goblin soon frees Spider-Man from the restraints because it would be a hollow victory to defeat an impaired Spider-Man.  The Goblin is confident because he feels Spider-Man has yet to defeat him in battle.  During the ensuing fight, the Goblin is knocked unconscious by an “electro-chemical charge”.  His exposure to the charge results in Norman getting temporary [[amnesia]] and forgetting the “last few years” and thus ever becoming the Green Goblin.  Peter changes Norman back into one of his civilian suits and the authorities believe the Green Goblin died in the fire.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #40</ref>  

Later, while Norman is living a Goblin-free life, [[Kraven the Hunter]] crosses his path because he is convinced Norman is the Goblin’s messenger.  Kraven claims that the Green Goblin offered him $20K to kill Spider-Man and he wanted an advance payment, but he couldn’t collect from the Goblin directly because he believed the Goblin was dead.  Unable to locate Norman, Kraven abducts Harry Osborn only to be thwarted by Spider-Man.  Norman arrives during the fight and Kraven immediately attacks him.  However, Kraven soon becomes convinced that Norman does not know anything about the Green Goblin nor the money he owes Kraven.  Kraven leaves Norman unharmed, as Norman was saved by his amnesia.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #47</ref>  Some time after those events, Norman meets Kraven and offers him  a great deal of money as well as an alliance.  Norman assures Kraven that he will someday control a vast worldwide empire.  However, Kraven feels dishonored by Norman’s actions and ends their brief alliance.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' 1996</ref>  

Norman continues to be periodically troubled by memories of the Green Goblin and Spider-Man.  The memories amount to nothing other than lashing out at the people around him, namely Harry, J. Jonah, and Peter.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #61-63</ref>  During a presentation by Captain George Stacy on supervillains, Norman’s memory is sparked by images of the Goblin battling Spider-Man.  He remembers that he is the Goblin and he is ready to exact his revenge on Peter Parker.  Norman holds a gathering for Harry and his friends in order to get Peter in a vulnerable situation.  Peter creates a diversion and gets out of Norman’s home, but the Goblin goes to Aunt May’s house.  A fight ensues and Spider-Man is exposed to a psychedelic bomb, which allows the Goblin to render Spider-Man helpless.  However, Spider-Man soon recovers and he uses the same psychedelic bomb on the Goblin, which induces another amnesia spell.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Magazine'' #2</ref>  At this point, Norman is still unaware the he is the Green Goblin.

Some time later, after watching a show featuring [[Mary Jane Watson]], Norman is troubled by a door that he sees in a back alleyway.  Peter follows Norman and changes into his Spidey costume.  The door turns out to be that of an old Goblin hideout and when Norman goes in his memory is jogged and he again becomes the Green Goblin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #96</ref>  A fight ensues and the Goblin thinks he has left Spider-Man to fall to his death.  Meanwhile, Harry overdoses on pills in an attempt to get Mary Jane off his mind.  Harry is then taken in an ambulance to the hospital for treatment.  A second battle between the Goblin and Spider-Man occurs and Spidey guides the Goblin on his glider to see Harry in the hospital.  The vision of Harry causes Norman to breakdown, once again having temporary amnesia and forgetting that he is the Goblin and that Peter is Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #98</ref>  As traumatic as these events were, Norman’s next dealing with Peter would prove his most tragic.

===Norman's death and resurrection===
Norman's conflict with Peter at a very personal level began in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man #39''.  The stresses that ultimately lead Norman to unleash the Goblin's fury on Spider-Man do not even originate from the wall crawler himself.  In fact, Harry's drug addiction resurfaces and he becomes bed ridden from overdosing on LSD.  The stress from Harry and the news that his company’s stock is down 13% causes Norman to lose control, have delusions involving Spider-Man and eventually revert to the Green Goblin.  He once again plans to exact his revenge upon Spider-Man and this time in doing so, he kidnaps [[Gwen Stacy]] who was at Peter’s home waiting for him.  Spider-Man tracks the Goblin to the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] where a fight ensues and the Goblin knocks Gwen off of the side of the bridge.  In one of the most memorable comic panels of the Silver Age, Spider-Man shoots a web line to catch the falling Gwen, but the jolt from the sudden stop appears to snap Gwen's neck.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #121</ref>  Because of that, Peter feels guilty for her death, in the same way he feels remorse for his [[Uncle Ben]]'s death. (However, the only conclusion in the matter to date has been Norman's claim that falling through the air as Gwen did would kill anyone,{{Issue|date=December 2009}} meaning she was already dead when Peter caught her.) Of interesting note, in [[Kurt Busiek]]'s ''[[Marvels]]'', photographer Phil Sheldon witnesses both the Green Goblin leaving the apartment with Gwen Stacy and her death on the bridge.  Enraged by the Goblin's brutal plan, Spider-Man continues fighting him on the bridge.  Spider-Man's fury blinds him and he gets sloppy; he is knocked out by a bridge cable, allowing the Goblin to escape.  Luckily, Peter gets a tip from [[Joe Robertson]] that leads him to finding Norman at his Goblin hideout.  In the ensuing fight, Spider-Man is able to neutralize the Goblin, but the Goblin sends his [[Goblin Glider]] to hit Spider-Man from behind.  Spider-Man ducks to avoid the glider and the Goblin is impaled, causing his “death.”  Peter feels no retribution in watching Norman die.  There is a mysterious figure watching all these events transpire and it is later revealed to be Harry Osborn.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #122</ref>  

Another interesting facet to this story arc and Spider-Man [[wikt:mythos|mythos]], is that in ''Amazing Spider-Man #121'', Spider-Man refers to the Brooklyn Bridge as the [[George Washington Bridge]] and even going further to say that Norman took her to this bridge because George Washington was Norman's favorite president.  Most stories published after ''Amazing Spider-Man #121'', refer to the site of this tragedy as occurring at the Brooklyn Bridge.  The artwork in ''Amazing Spider-Man #121'' is clearly indicative of the Brooklyn Bridge.

While Norman was believed to be dead, multiple individuals raided his Goblin hideouts and used his Green Goblin technology. The most notable were his son Harry Osborn, Harry's psychiatrist Bart Hamilton,<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #180</ref> [[Roderick Kingsley]]- remaking the costume into the Hobgoblin-,<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #238</ref> and Ben Urich's nephew Phil.<ref>Green Goblin #1 (1995)</ref>

However, Norman did not die that day.  In fact, the Green Goblin formula that gave Norman his powers, also endowed him with a [[healing factor]], which allowed him to circumvent this certain death.  Norman first awakes inside a morgue, where he realizes that he has survived the impalement of the glider.  He sees Harry bribing the mortician and decides to let Harry have a chance to be a man and take up the mantle of the Green Goblin.  Norman leaves for Europe where he can move more freely and be unnoticed.  He also becomes the undisputed leader of the Scrier cabal, which he utilizes to carry out his revenge on Peter Parker.  Norman schemes to play mind games with Peter using Seward Trainer, [[Judas Traveller]], the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], and [[Mendel Stromm]] (who is now the [[cyborg]]-like '''Gaunt''') as his pawns.  It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Peter during the infamous [[Clone Saga]].  Interestingly, Mendel Stromm apparently experimented on himself with Goblin formula, allowing Norman to revive him as well.<ref>''Spider-Man:  The Osborn Journal''</ref>  Norman waits in the shadows for the perfect time to exact his revenge on his arch-nemesis.

As the Clone Saga comes to an end, Peter Parker and [[Ben Reilly]] have accepted the “fact” that Peter is the clone and Ben is the original Spider-Man.  [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] is pregnant with Peter’s child, who’s due date is approaching.  Seward Trainer, a friend of Ben Reilly, is killed by Norman Osborn, who is now ready to return from hiding and confront Peter.<ref>Spectacular Spider-Man Vol. 1 #240</ref>  Later, Peter and Ben fight Gaunt and neutralize him, however during the fight Mary Jane goes into labor.<ref>Sensational Spider-Man Vol. 1 #11</ref>  Gaunt is then killed by Norman because of his failure.  Mary Jane is informed that the baby did not survive the birthing process.  Alison Mongrain, who was working for Norman, along with the help of a Doctor Folsome were responsible for deceiving Mary Jane about the baby and kidnapping it.  Alison is instructed by Norman to “make sure it’s never seen again.”<ref>Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 #418</ref> Peter soon leaves to see Mary Jane in the hospital and when he gets there, Dr. Folsome informs him that “there’s been a problem”, before sedating Peter.  Meanwhile, [[J. Jonah Jameson]], [[Flash Thompson]], [[Liz Allan]], and others have been mysteriously invited to the [[Daily Bugle]] from different sources; they soon realize that they have been trapped.  Norman reveals himself to Peter along with explaining how he survived the glider impaling him with his healing factor, that he's been in Europe hiding all this time, and that he has returned because he was tired of Peter rebounding from all the things he’s thrown at him and he wants to exact his final revenge.  He also informs Peter that Ben Reilly was actually the clone, not Peter.  Norman reveals himself as the mastermind behind the entire Clone Saga hoax.  He then leads Peter to the Daily Bugle where he wants Peter to watch him kill “all those close to him”, before he kills Peter.  Ben sneaks the hostages out of the Daily Bugle, and makes his way to Peter, who has neutralized the Goblin.  Ben is killed when he steps in front of the Goblin Glider in an attempt to save Peter.  The glider impales him.  Peter hurls a bag of pumpkin bombs at the Green Goblin, which explode when they hit him, and the Goblin vanishes out of sight.<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #75</ref>  Ben Reilly dies and his body disintegrates, revealing him as the true clone.  Peter does not find Norman's body, but he knows that he has not seen the last of his enemy.  The significance of this era of Norman Osborn's life is that from the moment he awoke in the morgue, he has always been aware that he is the Green Goblin, his amnesiac episodes over.

===Norman distances himself from the Green Goblin===
Neither Norman Osborn nor the Green Goblin were seen since the events of ''Peter Parker Spider-Man #75''.  Prior to a public announcement of his return, Norman sneaks up on Daily Bugle reporter [[Betty Brant]] and informs her that he now owns half of the Daily Bugle.<ref name="ReferenceB">''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #249</ref>  At the press conference, Norman states that he was hiding in Europe to avoid his enemies, which include Spider-Man.  He also states that he has come back because of the “smear campaign” bestowed upon his family name by [[Ben Urich]].  Urich had written a book called ''The Legacy of Evil'', which outed Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin.  Norman states that he has now dedicated his life to finding out who the Green Goblin “really is”.   When Peter returns to his ransacked home, he attacks Norman at his apartment, beating him up very badly.  Unfortunately, this is all caught on tape and the Daily Bugle puts a $1 million reward on Spider-Man’s head.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  

During the ''Spider-Hunt'' saga, Dr. Jonas Meuller, aka Dr. Angst, is working for Osborn on a genetic construct that will fill the role of the Green Goblin and prevent Norman from being suspected as such.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #25</ref>  Norman’s grandson, [[Normie Osborn]], is kidnapped by this construct “Green Goblin” and Spider-Man amongst others, try to find Normie.  Spider-Man tracks down this alternate Goblin and the Goblin “dies” in an explosion that occurred during the fight.  Normie is returned to Norman by Override and Clarence Fielding, a regular guy.  At the conclusion of the story it is revealed that Norman arranged the kidnapping of Normie by the alternate Goblin in an effort to sway public opinion away from him being the Green Goblin.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #255</ref>  

The reward on Spider-Man's head is now $5 million because he is also the suspected murderer of a thug named Joey Z.  Peter retires his Spider-Man costume and chooses to don [[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis|four new costume identities]]: [[Hornet (comics)|The Hornet]], [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]], [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], and [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]].  As the Dusk persona, Peter aids the [[Trapster]] who also seeks revenge on Norman Osborn, having deduced that the Trapster was responsible for Joey Z's death as the only person capable of manufacturing a substance similar to his webbing.  The Trapster threatens to kill Osborn, but Dusk stops him from doing so and Osborn gets away, leaving the Trapster's only remaining 'weapon' against Osborn being to publicly confess to having killed Joey Z and exonerates Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #92</ref>   As the Prodigy persona, Peter battles with Conundrum and Jack O’Lantern to return Tabriaz Chaliz, the kidnapped daughter of the Sufindian ambassador.  We learn later that Norman had orchestrated that kidnapping as well.  Prodigy exonerates Spider-Man by stating that it was either Conundrum or Jack O’Lantern who disguised themselves as Spider-Man and attacked Norman Osborn at his apartment.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #258</ref>  Spider-Man is no longer a wanted criminal, and the Identity Crisis story arc comes to an end.

Soon after, Roderick Kingsley, who is currently being held in prison for his crimes as [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], spreads word out that he has an incriminating diary exposing Norman Osborn as the true Green Goblin.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #259</ref>  This sets up the first conflict between the original Green Goblin and the Hobgoblin.  While being transferred from prison, Roderick is abducted by the alternate Goblin and brought to Norman Osborn.  Norman suspects fraud, stating that any journals that did exist were burnt up during the Spider-Man and Hobgoblin battle that occurred in ''Amazing Spider-Man #250''.  Roderick was bluffing about having the diary, and Norman takes over all of Roderick’s financial interests in Kingsley Ltd.  During a fight between the Hobgoblin, the Green Goblin, Norman Osborn, and Spider-Man the Hobgoblin escapes, as does Norman wearing the Goblin mask.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #261</ref>  

In an attempt to kill Norman Osborn and seize control of the NYC underworld, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] sends the assassin [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] to blow Norman up at the Daily Bugle building.  After Nitro detonates himself, Norman, Peter, Normie, and Betty Brant become trapped in the destroyed elevator remains.  After some psychological provoking by Norman, Peter decides to save Betty and Normie from the elevator despite the risk of the internal cameras witnessing him displaying superhuman strength (Although it is subsequently confirmed that the cameras were down).  After saving Betty and Normie, Peter goes back and saves Norman in the nick of time.  Despite the rescue, Norman would soon return to the role of the Green Goblin to terrorize Peter and those close to him.<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #95</ref>

===The Gathering of Five===
Norman Osborn now gathered 5 individuals together for the arcane ritual of the ''Gathering of Five'' in which each participant receives one of five possible ''gifts'':  power, immortality, knowledge, madness, or death.  Each individual must make the choice to be a part of the ritual with an open heart and a conviction of purpose.  The five members are [[Madame Web]], [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Martha “Matt” Franklin]], Gregory Herd (aka Override), Morris Maxwell, and Norman Osborn.  Meanwhile, Alison Mongrain, along with Joe Roberston, is making her way to Peter Parker in an attempt to deliver vital information to him.  She doesn’t reach Peter, but she finds Mary Jane and before she “dies” she tells MJ that May Parker is still alive and she is being held at Norman’s hunting lodge upstate.  Mary Jane tells Peter this and he resolves to go after Norman; MJ tries to stop him claiming that it is probably just another trap set by Norman.  Meanwhile, after the Gathering of Five ritual, Norman becomes convinced that he is given the gift of power.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #441</ref>  

Peter makes his way to Norman’s hunting lodge and after battling some mutant beasts he confronts Norman, who is now garbed as the Green Goblin.  Norman claims that he is now tired of “his personal vendetta he’s waged” against Peter and their dealings will soon come to an end.  Norman also claims that he is planning on releasing a "DNA bomb" in order to reshape the world in his image, a threat that appears substantiated due to a report that 50 people were killed, just "melting" in their clothing at a subsidiary of Osborn Industries.  After neutralizing the Goblin with webbing, Spider-Man heads into the estate to find his baby May. However, he was misled, as the ''May'' Alison Mongrain was referring to was his deceased [[Aunt May]].<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #97</ref>  

Peter takes this Aunt May to [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] who runs a slew of tests on her.  Reed claims that she is human and not a clone and that untampered DNA evidence would be the final piece of confirmation that she is the real deal.  Peter finds an old blood sample of Aunt May’s to bring to Richards.  Upon Peter's return to the [[Baxter Building]], Reed informs Peter that someone has implanted a device at the base of the skull of his aunt and if it is not removed soon she will die.  Peter confronts Norman, who has been waiting for him, to find out what the purpose of the device is.  Norman provides ample information.  First, the device in her skull is the “trigger” for the worldwide DNA bomb; once it is removed the bomb will detonate.  Second, this Aunt May is the real Aunt May and the person who died in ''Amazing Spider-Man #400'' was an actress hired by Norman and infused with May’s genetic matrix.  This actress, who was to play her final role, was trained to mimic every aspect of May in order to confuse and destroy Peter.  Norman, as the Green Goblin, proceeds to defeat Spider-Man and unmasks him publicly.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #263</ref>  

However, it is soon revealed that this was just a delusion: the Green Goblin himself is defeated, Norman Osborn having received the gift of madness from the ''Gathering of Five''.  The other gifts were as follows:  Martha Franklin receives power, [[Madame Web]] receives immortality, Morris Maxwell receives knowledge, and Gregory Herd receives death.  Gregory Herd, formerly Override, eventually becomes the villain [[Shadrac]].  During the fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, the Daily Bugle building was destroyed, but Peter manages to temporarily stop it from falling by webbing it up.  Reed Richards neutralizes the device in May’s skull and she is now recuperating from the surgery.  Norman is taken to the psychiatric ward at Bellevue where he is unmasked by the guards/doctor, who immediately cry out, “his face”.  Before they could do anything else, a group of Scriers take out the guards/doctor and steal Norman Osborn claiming that he “belongs to the Scriers”.<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #98</ref>

===The Goblin Heir===
Norman Osborn, now dependent upon a cocktail of drugs to maintain his sanity, is in a safehouse as he ponders recent dealings with Spider-Man.  His companion, Donald Menken, who was first introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man #239'' as an employee of Osborn Industries, is at Norman's side.  Menken is revealed to have been one of the loyal Scriers who removed Osborn from the psychiatric ward after the events of the ''Gathering of Five'' ritual.  Norman has fallen in love with his nurse, Kolina Frederickson, and he states that she reminds him of his now deceased wife Emily.  Norman feels the time is perfect for an attack on Spider-Man with the recent death of Mary Jane and the loss of all his savings.  Norman disguises himself as a mailman and tampers with Peter and [[Randy Robertson]]’s mail.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #1</ref> 

Norman created a cabal known as the ''Order of the Goblin'' from those Scriers who remained loyal to him during his recent “incapacitation”, his bout with insanity.  After Kolina inadvertently stumbles upon Norman in his Goblin garb, he tosses a gas bomb at her, not knowing it was her, and he nearly kills her.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #2</ref>  Norman than decides to reveal his life story to Kolina and come clean.  Peter Parker is now suffering from hallucinations induced by the toothpaste Norman planted in his mail, causing him to have Goblin-related delusions.  Norman states that he desires to make Peter the heir to his Osborn Legacy and that he shall become the next Green Goblin.  Osborn sends Kolina and Donald to his estate in the Adirondacks.<ref>''Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin'' #3</ref>  

Norman then visits an old family estate and recalls the memory of his father forcing him to stay in the old house overnight to become a man and face the darkness.  Peter is still experiencing hallucinations involving the Goblin and is beginning to figure that Norman is behind these hallucinations.  When Peter once again regains consciousness he is being held captive by Norman who is determined to make Peter face the darkness and become an Osborn.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #25</ref>  

We also learn that the [[hallucinogens]] that Peter was exposed to contained some of the Goblin formula.  Peter is tortured by Osborn for what appears to be weeks as Norman tries to break Peter’s spirit and accept the darkness.  Peter eventually overcomes the mind games and rejects being the heir to the Osborn legacy as well as accepting the darkness.  Norman tells Peter that he realized Peter was the rightful heir when he came to visit the birth of his grandson Normie and saw that Peter was secretly visiting the hospital as well.  Norman claims that he has won, because for a brief moment during the torture, Peter “blinked” at the darkness, and that meant that Peter would no longer be able to maintain his altruistic façade.<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #25</ref>

===A Death in the Family===
The story begins with Norman visiting Harry’s grave, and in Norman's introspection he states that he had reached out to Peter and that he had refused him, and that Norman can’t let things stand at that.  Meanwhile, Peter is haunted by a dream and he has no one he can confide in; he tries Mary Jane, but decides not to talk to her (she is in California and they aren’t together).  As if drawn to each other, Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in the middle of a rain storm; a fight ensues and Norman leaves Peter with an invitation to a family reunion - a funeral.<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #44</ref>  The Green Goblin then appears on TV stating that it was Spider-Man who was responsible for the death of Gwen Stacy and that he had originally planned to catch her after her drop.  Peter confronts Norman while Norman is with some clients and Norman tells Peter that one of them, either Peter or Norman, has to die.  The Green Goblin then force feeds [[Flash Thompson]], a recovering alcoholic, whiskey and then has him drive a truck that crashes into Midtown High.  Due to the accident, Flash goes into a coma.<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #45</ref>

Norman offers to repair Midtown High since it was his company’s truck that crashed into the school.  Later, Norman has Peter meet him at one of Osborn’s chemical companies. While there, Norman states that he plans to kill his grandson, [[Normie Osborn]].<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #46</ref>  The fight continues and Norman states that only one of them can leave there today and that he has operatives stationed all over the place and they are ready to kill those close to Peter at any time.  An enraged Peter Parker pummels the Green Goblin, beating him mercilessly.  Just before delivering the final blow, Peter releases Norman and says that he can’t kill him.  The two even share a laugh at that point.  He then confides in Norman about his dream at which point Peter realizes the meaning of the dream.  Everyday he refuses to hate Norman for what he did and Gwen lives; if he caves into the anger she dies. He doesn’t cave into the anger and Peter calls Norman’s bluff concerning killing young Normie.  As the story arc closes, the two rivals share a laugh, in a scene reminiscent of the conclusion to [[Alan Moore]]’s ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]''.  It appears as though Norman set the whole thing up because he wanted Peter to kill him; that was the “death in the family” and Norman contemplates suicide at the conclusion.  The ramifications from this story arc are numerous; however, one of the major results is Flash becoming a [[paraplegic]].<ref>''Peter Parker Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #47</ref>

===The Goblin outed publicly===
Terri Kidder, a reporter for the Daily Bugle, follows a lead she was given from a friend concerning missing persons at Oscorp.  Her friend is an employee at Oscorp.  In an attempt to break the story, she tricks her way into the office of Norman Osborn to question him about the missing people.<ref>''The Pulse'' #1</ref>  She is then found dead and mutilated in the reservoir on the east side of [[Central Park]].  [[Ben Urich]] puts the pieces together and eventually the police come to investigate Norman for the missing bodies. When they arrive at Norman’s office, they find the Green Goblin instead.  Spider-Man intervenes and neutralizes the Goblin, who nearly kills both Ben Urich and [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]]’s girlfriend.  Luke Cage, angered by the attacks on his then-pregnant girlfriend, goes after Norman after he had already surrendered to the authorities.  To escape this attack Norman dons his Goblin apparel, but Luke subdues him.  The story concludes with Osborn being confirmed publicly as the Green Goblin and being placed in jail.<ref>''The Pulse'' #5</ref>

===Norman kidnaps Aunt May===
This story arc picks up immediately after the events of ''The Pulse'', where Spider-Man is now in the process of tracking down the Green Goblin.  He succeeds and the Goblin is brought into prison, but Norman sues Spider-Man for aggravated assault charges due to the nature of which Spider-Man overpowered him.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #1</ref>  When Peter returns home, he gets a phone call in the middle of the night that someone has defaced his [[Uncle Ben]]’s grave.  Peter goes to the grave site to see.  Unfortunately, this was a decoy because [[Aunt May]] was kidnapped from his home while he was gone.  He confronts Norman in prison, thinking that he is to blame, and Norman plays mind games with Peter as to whether or not he is involved, basically providing no information for him.  Interestingly, in the course of the conversation we learn that Norman's age is 55.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2</ref>  

Later, Mac Gargan approaches Peter Parker, claiming to be the one responsible for kidnapping Aunt May, and he says that he was working for Norman Osborn, but that this kidnapping is the “tip of the iceberg” for Norman’s plans.  Gargan tells Peter the history of supervillains and that they were created in the forties when the “ruling class”, companies responsible for putting governments into office, desired to keep emerging superheroes at bay, and away from discovering the corruptness which this "ruling class" has been utilizing to prevail.  This “divide and conquer” tactic led to contracted supervillains, of which Norman Osborn was one of the favorites, until he went out of control with the Goblin persona.  This corrupt administration is no longer operating but there were some famous names in the “original cabal”.<ref name="Marvel Knights Spider-Man #9"/>   Due to that Norman has become a target because he knows where “all the bodies are buried” and he is a sitting duck in prison. So Norman Osborn orchestrated the kidnapping of Aunt May in order to solicit Peter’s help to break him out of prison; he has to help him or Aunt May dies.  Peter reluctantly decides to help break him out, and in the process of doing so he receives help from the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].  Peter successfully breaks Norman out, but when he does, the Green Goblin has a surprise for him.  The Green Goblin double crosses Peter and has the Sinister Twelve, a group composed of classic Spider-Man villains such as the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Hydro-Man]], and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] waiting for him.  Fortunately, Mary Jane called [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as well as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and the [[Fantastic Four]] to help neutralize them.  The Green Goblin leaves to go kill Mary Jane, and Spider-Man then goes after him.  They meet on what looks to be the [[George Washington Bridge]].  A mind controlled [[Doctor Octopus]], who has been programmed to kill Norman Osborn, arrives at the scene.  A lightning bolt strikes and hits the Goblin, who was holding his Goblin Glider in the air as well as Doc Ock, and sends both of them plunging into the water below.  Peter finds Aunt May buried alive in the grave site of his Uncle Ben, reaching her just in time to save her life.  The story concludes with a letter written from Norman to Peter thanking him for providing the intellectual and physical challenge as Spider-Man as they have provided his life with both structure and meaning.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

===Sins Past===
{{Main|Gabriel & Sarah Stacy}}
This controversial story arc begins with Peter receiving a letter in the mail from [[Gwen Stacy]]. There is only one page of the letter and its clear information is missing.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #509</ref>  Peter takes the letter to Detective Lamont, who passes the letter on to forensics in order to figure out if something was written on the back side of the paper, which might possibly provide more insight into what is going on.  While visiting Gwen’s grave, Peter is attacked by two unknown assailants, one male and one female.  Lamont gives the letter back with what could be retrieved from the original letter and it is revealed that Gwen was pregnant with twins and that she had given birth to them; their names were Gabriel and Sarah.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #510</ref>  The two assailants were Gabriel and Sarah and they are determined to kill Peter Parker/Spider-Man because they are convinced that he is their father who abandoned them and killed their mother. Realizing that they could not have been born normal to begin with, since they would only be a few years old by this point, Peter runs DNA tests on the letters to see if they really are Gwen’s kids. The tests confirm they are her biological children.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #511</ref>  

Mary Jane tells Peter that she knows who the real father is and that Gwen confided in her in regards to an affair she had with  Norman Osborn roughly 7 months before she died. She had given birth to the children in Europe, where they remained hidden. This provides Peter the insight into some of Norman's prior motivations including why he chose Gwen of all people to kill and why he went hiding in Europe after his “death”. Also, Gwen would not let Norman have the children, which explains why Norman was so hungry for an heir and wanted Peter to fill that role. Gwen had wanted Peter to help raise the children. There was still the question as to why the children were as old as they were, as the timeline didn't make sense. It turned out that Norman’s Goblin formula, which has integrated into his DNA and provides him with rapid regenerative capabilities, had been passed down to his offspring and explained their rapid aging.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #512</ref> Unfortunately, the twins are now dying and need Peter’s help in order to stay alive. Norman, while in Europe, fed the children the false information that Peter was their father and that he was responsible for their mother’s death. At the Brooklyn Bridge, Peter tells Sarah and Gabriel that Norman is their father, explaining that they need help. Whereas Sarah believes him, Gabriel refuses to listen, and in the ensuing fight, he inadvertently shoots Sarah.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #513</ref>  Peter gives Sarah his blood to keep her alive, while Gabriel remembers instructions he was given by Osborn to find a Goblin hideout.  When he arrives there, Norman has a pre-recorded message for him and an enhancing formula that should have curb the  aging process.  He then dons the Grey Goblin costume.  The Grey Goblin attacks Peter in the hospital, but Sarah steps in to help.  Gabriel is knocked into the water and he washes up on shore with temporary amnesia.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #514</ref>

===Civil War===
{{Main|Civil War: Front Line}}

While in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Osborn watches in shock as Spider-Man publicly reveals his secret identity as Peter Parker (also confirming Osborn's identity as the Goblin and his role in Gwen's death in the process), railing that Peter "broke the rules".<ref>''Civil War Front Line'' #2</ref> He is then approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who are seeking his aid. The Goblin confronts and attacks Ben Urich in an alley, but S.H.I.E.L.D.'s nano-machines cause him to stop, involuntarily making him collapse and foam at the mouth.<ref>''Civil War Front Line'' #4-5</ref>

Later, he makes a deal with a shadowy figure who gives him a serum to override the control of nano-machines implanted by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Civil War Front Line'' #7</ref> In the next two issues, Osborn attacks a group of [[homo mermanus|Atlanteans]] in his Goblin gear, killing and wounding many. Later, when one Atlantean ambassador attempts to give a speech, Norman appears and shoots at him, wounding but not killing him. As he is being taken away by security, Norman says he is 'sick' and is not in control of his actions. While being interrogated by two officers, Norman becomes increasingly agitated when they question who gave Norman access to the press conference and assisted in smuggling a weapon there. At first, Norman gets angry, threatening to kill the two officers' families, but then becomes more and more afraid until the shadowy figure arrives at which point Norman begs the officers not to let him go, even promising to reveal all he knows to them.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Norman Osborn is the government's appointed new director of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and has been prescribed medication to stabilize his personality. He has alternately used diplomacy, force, and humiliation to keep the field team in line, and enjoys the status and power he has, as well as his criminal career being quietly swept under the carpet. He remains unbalanced, however, due to his habit of mixing his medication and because Thunderbolt [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] has influenced attendants to switch his medication with [[placebo]]s on alternate days so as to get him fired and take his place.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} He has also forced the supervillain [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] and his allies to secretly work for him directly.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason in Madness''</ref> As a Director for the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], Osborn was present and involved in a joint CSA/UN tribunal against [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], being aggressive and clashing with witness [[Doc Samson]].<ref>''Iron Man'' (Vol.4) #27-8</ref>

When four [[telepathy|telepaths]] try to destroy the Thunderbolts from the inside, they target Osborn with [[hallucination]]s of his Goblin mask,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref> eventually causing him to break down completely in response to [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]] going rogue. Driven to become the Green Goblin again, he brutally [[assault]]s and [[Crucifixion|crucifies]] Swordsman before being telepathically nudged into murdering the entire Thunderbolt Mountain staff.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #120</ref> He engages [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] in battle, and both knock each other unconscious. When [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] murders the four telepaths in their cells, all of the Thunderbolts return to normal.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>

====''New Ways to Die''====
{{Main|New Ways to Die}}
During the course of the ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'' storyline, which ended with the removal of Peter and Mary-Jane's marriage from all memories, the situation changes so that Norman's son, Harry, is revealed to be alive once more and no one (including Norman) knows Spider-Man's secret identity. Norman returns to the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' title in a storyline entitled ''[[New Ways to Die]]''.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16246 Enemies at the Gates: Wacker Talks "Amazing Spider-Man"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 1, 2008</ref> In addition to calling the Thunderbolts to New York to hunt down Spider-Man, Norman agrees to help New York mayoral candidate Randall Crowne, who got into trouble when [[Ben Urich]]'s newspaper ''Frontline'' revealed that he had been operating an illegal sweatshop. Norman confronts the man who took the photos:  Peter Parker. Norman is unable to find a way Parker can contact Spider-Man and leaves him. When he later observes a fight between [[Mac Gargan#Venom|Venom]], [[Eddie Brock#Anti-Venom|Anti-Venom]], and Spider-Man, Norman is confronted by [[Menace (comics)|Menace]]. After a short confrontation, Menace spares him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction. As Menace leaves, Norman finds Peter Parker's camera and uses it to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] the tracing system allowing the camera to zero on Spider-Man's chest. Norman later uses the captured villain [[Freak (Marvel Comics)#Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]] to produce a counter-measure for Anti-Venom, at the same time providing Gargan with a protective Scorpion battle suit that will distribute the cure throughout his body, healing the [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]  faster. However when faced with the combined might of Anti-Venom and Spider-Man, Anti-Venom flees the fight and Norman had to destroy his recent New York Headquarters after his fight with Spider-Man. However, he is still reclaimed a hero within the eyes of the public.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man # 568-573''</ref>

====Secret Invasion====
{{Main|Secret Invasion}}
[[Captain Marvel (Khn'nr)|Captain Marvel]], revealed to be a [[Skrull]] sleeper agent, attacks Thunderbolt Mountain, but he can't bring himself to kill. Norman Osborn offers him a chance to explain himself, speaking with him in private, and convincing him to leave. Following this, it becomes clear the Thunderbolts - due to Norman forcing the usage of Oscorp technology over [[Stark Industries]] products, the latter of which has been deactivated by Skrull agents - are the only team that can reach and defend [[Washington, D.C.]] Norman successfully manages and directs the team, while personally joining the battle with a machine gun. During the conflict, several Skrulls [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into duplicates of Spider-Man, the sight of whom drives Norman into an apparent [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123</ref> He guns down every one of them, stating the slaughter to be "therapeutic" for him.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124</ref>

After saving the capital city, Norman is able to successfully manipulate the media to promote himself and the team as patriotic heroes, as well as undermining the CSA and his former industrial rival [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], who appeared to retreat in the heat of battle. He subsequently leads the team to New York, joining the final battle.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #125</ref> His heroic status is exemplified when numerous TV cameras capture his gunshot killing the Skrull Queen [[Veranke]]. When the [[President of the United States]] shuts down [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and indicts Tony Stark, Norman is given the role of running the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|SHRA]] and the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Avengers Initiative]]. He then meets with his newly created 'Cabal', consisting of [[Doctor Doom]], [[Namor]], [[Emma Frost]], The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref name="Secret Invasion #8">''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> They have been pulling the strings to help Osborn and themselves gain control of all governments and business empires, the desire of most supervillains.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Dark Reign'' One Shot</ref>

===Dark Reign===
====Cementing power====
{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}
Promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and head of the entire Avengers/Initiative set-up created by the now disgraced Tony Stark, Norman stamps his authority on the Marvel Universe by changing S.H.I.E.L.D. into H.A.M.M.E.R., with S.H.I.E.L.D. secretary Victoria Hand as his second, using the aftereffects of the invasion to his advantage. Norman has operatives track down the living computer QUASIMODO. QUASIMODO agrees to help Osborn and for his first act creates a database of 189 "persons of interest", each of whom mostly straddles the line between good and evil.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Norman then reorganizes the [[Fifty State Initiative|50 State Initiative]], claiming it was a failed program from the mind of Stark and placed villains on Initiative teams. He also buys out and takes control of StarkTech, merging it with Oscorp. This gives him hundreds of classified documents and tech specs, along with Tony's armada of Iron Man suits.

Osborn next ceases the Thunderbolts Initiative, claiming it has done its job. By doing this, he actually turns the current Thunderbolts team into the Cabal's personal [[black operation|black op]]s team. With [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Black Widow II]] leading it, this team will do the dirty work for them, starting with taking down any and all superhero threats to their plans. When overseeing the shutdown of Thunderbolts Mountain, an irate [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]] confronts Norman about his action. Norman seizes his sword and murders him in a psychotic tantrum. Norman Osborn then throws Swordsman out of a window, watching as the body tumbles down the mountainside. Norman then realizes that his Green Goblin side is starting to go berserk.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Dark Reign'' #1</ref>

Norman is called to ride aboard [[Air Force One]] by the new U.S. President. On board, [[Doc Samson]] reveals that he has footage of Norman as the Goblin murdering security forces inside Thunderbolts Mountain. Osborn tries to frame Samson by suggesting that he was actually involved. Before Samson can play this evidence, the new Thunderbolts take control of Air Force One, and someone dressed as the Green Goblin attacks.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #128</ref> At the same time, a Gamma Radiation emitter planted on Samson by [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]] causes Samson to "Hulk out", becoming stronger and less rational, even threatening the President. Norman uses a device to knock out everyone on the plane (except himself, Samson, and the Goblin) and has Ghost phase Samson out of the plane. When the President awakens, Norman starts fighting the Goblin, their dialogue suggesting that the Goblin had tried to kill Norman at Thunderbolts mountain. Norman throws the Goblin out of the plane. At this point, it is revealed (to the reader) that the Goblin is actually Headsman, one of Norman's new Thunderbolts, who is saved from the fall by his teammates. In the aftermath, the President places Norman in charge of the country's security.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #129</ref>

====Dark Avengers====
[[File:DarkavengersIP.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Norman Osborn as the Iron Patriot]]{{Main|Dark Avengers}}
Norman's next order of business is setting up his new team of Avengers. He is able to recruit [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|The Sentry]], and [[Noh-Varr|Marvel Boy]] (now calling himself [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), as well as giving his former Thunderbolts new identities ([[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] becomes [[Ms. Marvel]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] becomes Spider-Man, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] becomes [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Daken]] takes the identity of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].) Osborn is able to use the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] to break into [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s armor vault and create his own suit, becoming the '''Iron Patriot'''.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref>

However, certain factions, both good and evil are threatening to undermine Osborn and expose him for the psychopath that he is. Clint Barton went live and accused him of placing criminals in the Avengers and as his black ops team;<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref> Loki, disguised as the [[Scarlet Witch]], assembled her own team of Avengers, who were considered by other countries to be "true" Avengers;<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #24</ref> heroes in the Initiative formed the [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Avengers Resistance]] to expose him;<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #26</ref> and [[Nick Fury]] and his [[Secret Warriors]] are coercing [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents to join his side against Osborn and the renewed HYDRA threat.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #5-6</ref> All this was to make Osborn slip up more and more. They know that Osborn will crack sooner or later, especially because he hasn't slept since his rise to power.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #6</ref>

====World's Most Wanted====
After Tony Stark is removed from power, Osborn attempts to attain the former Superhuman Registration Database to find out the identities of the registered superhumans. After a confrontation with Stark, Osborn learns that Stark has downloaded the entire database into his mind. Osborn becomes enraged and starts sending assassins after Stark, unaware that he is deleting his mind with his powers in order to keep the database out of Osborn's hands. After offering Tony a surrender, Osborn seizes all Stark Industries buildings across the country and serves a warrant for Tony's arrest. As Tony begins fleeing around the world, Osborn devotes HAMMER's resources to finding him. After seeing War Machine being defeated by Tony, Osborn asks Namor to capture him. Namor fails to capture Stark and Tony continues his escape, but he detains Stark's friend Pepper Potts, who also has a suit of armor. After a while, he lets her go and brings in Madame Masque to find Stark. After Stark and Pepper escape from her Osborn decides that he will go out and take Stark on his own. The two clash and get into a very brutal battle. Tony's intelligence is almost gone, so Osborn easily begins to beat him. He brutally beats Tony so badly that Tony gets brain damage, but Tony had set up a trap. Their whole fight had been taped for the whole world to see, and now Osborn's name has been damaged beyond repair and Tony is delivered into the medical hands of Donald Blake, the alter-ego of Thor.<ref>''Invincible Iron-Man #19''</ref>

====American Son====
{{Main|American Son (comics)}}
A storyline in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' details Norman's relationship with his son, Harry. During a dinner at Mayor [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s residence (celebrating his father and [[Aunt May]]'s upcoming nuptials), Norman stops by and offers Harry a job at H.A.M.M.E.R. Harry refuses, but reconsiders later when he finds out that [[Menace (comics)|Lily Hollister]] is pregnant with his child. Meanwhile, Spider-Man attacks Norman in public after the dinner, telling him to leave Harry alone. After Harry's first day working at the Avengers' Tower, he sneaks into restricted areas (using Green Goblin gadgets), and finds a antidote serum for Lily.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #595</ref>

Meanwhile, Spider-Man has disguised himself as [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], and during a meeting of the [[Dark Avengers]], Norman reveals he wants to turn Harry into the "American Son," a hero combining Iron Man's armor technology and Captain America's super-soldier serum (which Osborn has created using Captain America's blood samples and Goblin serum).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #596</ref>

Spider-Man is revealed not to be Venom, and the Dark Avengers battle and capture him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #597</ref> While restrained, Norman allows [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to torture Spider-Man, but they are unable to remove his mask, as it was made by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] from [[unstable molecules]].

As Harry leaves the building, he encounters Lily, explaining his theft of the antidote. She laughs at him, claiming she wants to be Menace, and quickly changes into a more Goblin-oriented form of Menace (while still noticeably pregnant). She then confesses the child is Norman's, not his. Harry runs back inside to find the tortured Spider-Man, leading to a father-son confrontation, made more bitter from Spider-Man forcing Norman into confessing his plan to have the ''American Son'' die after his inception, to bring Americans around the Iron Patriot.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref> Harry then fights Norman using the American Son armor.  Norman insults Harry saying that he had to breed a better child to make up for Harry's failure. Harry almost decapitates Norman but instead walks away accepting that Norman is no longer his father, ruining his greatest plan.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #599</ref>

====Utopia====
{{Main|Utopia (comics)}} 
When riots begin in San Francisco over regulation for mutants, H.A.M.M.E.R. moved in to secure the situation. Osborn branded [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] as the instigator of the chaos and turned public opinion against him and the [[X-Men]]. He had [[Namor]] and [[Emma Frost]] assemble a team of mutants to serve as [[Dark X-Men|Osborn's X-Men]] for the riots and rounded up hostile mutants to subject to the Omega Machine, a device created by [[Dark Beast]] to sap them of their powers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> Cyclops then comes to negotiate with Osborn and demand that he leave the city once he had the riots under control. However, their arguments go nowhere, so Cyclops leaves. Osborn declares to Ms. Hand that he will kill Cyclops personally.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #7</ref>

Soon enough, Frost and Namor turn on Osborn, having been working for Cyclops the whole time, allowing [[X-Force]] to evacuate the captive mutants. They retreat to a rebuilt [[Asteroid M]], christened Utopia. Cyclops then denounces Osborn and his methods on live television. Angered at this betrayal, Osborn becomes determined to kill his fellow Cabal members.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8</ref>

====The List====
{{Main|Dark_Reign_(comics)#The_List}} 
After the events of Utopia, Osborn realizes that the status quo has failed the world in many areas. He makes a "must-do" list of people and things that need to be dealt with, such as the New Avengers, Daredevil, Nick Fury, the X-Men and the [[Punisher]]. Clint Barton comes to kill him but is captured instead, with Osborn remarking that is one down from his list.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Avengers'' #1</ref>

He later tasks Victoria Hand and Karla Sofen with the presumed mission of taking out [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] and his son [[Skaar]]. Using Kate Waynesboro as bait, the fight spans multiple facilities researching Kate and Skaar's Oldpower. It is revealed that the last facility also exposed them to Gamma radiation which accelerated Bruce's metabolism, speeding up an eventual return of his Hulk powers (previously stripped away by the [[Red Hulk]]). Osborn checks off Banner's name, knowing that he's less dangerous when he devotes his entire intellect to suppressing the beast within.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Hulk'' #1</ref>

Osborn is coerced into helping Nick Fury when Fury breaks into Avengers Tower and is simply let in by Ares. When Fury is unfazed by his list, Osborn gives him the name of a target that is secretly giving secrets to a shadowy group. Osborn, Bullseye, and Fury interrogate the man, but when Fury gets what he needs, he attacks Osborn and escapes. Osborn has HAMMER try to chase Fury, but Ares intervenes and drives the helicopters off.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Secret Warriors'' #1</ref>

When a group of black clad ninjas attack and kill a group of corrupt cops, Osborn learns that Daredevil is now the leader of the Hand. Seeing this as a sign of a potential enemy, Osborn orders Bullseye to kill Daredevil. The two clash along with HAMMER agents and the Hand ninjas accompanying Daredevil. Bullseye rigs a building full of people to explode and offers Daredevil a choice: save them or fight him. The building explodes and Daredevil is left to his grief. Unbeknownst to Osborn, the ninjas were actually sent by the Kingpin and Lady Bullseye to get his attention.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Daredevil'' #1</ref>

After the events of Utopia and Namor's betrayal, Osborn releases Marrina, Namor's former lover, to destroy the Atlanteans. After a massive assault on Atlantis, Marrina begins to come near Utopia. The X-Men battle Marrina and manage to stun her, but Namor kills her without remorse. At Avengers Tower, Osborn is on the phone when Marrina's head is flung into the room. Namor appears in front of Osborn and says that he will pay for what he has done. The confrontation afterwards is not seen, but later on, Namor's name is seen checked off.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - X-Men'' #1</ref>

Following repeated failed attempts to kill Frank Castle, Norman Osborn sends [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s son [[Daken]] and a [[platoon]] of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (comics)|H.A.M.M.E.R]] troops to complete this mission. After a bloody round of [[hand-to-hand]] combat, Daken [[dismember]]s and [[decapitate]]s Castle, before kicking his remains from a rooftop.<ref>''Dark Reign - The List - The Punisher'' #1</ref>.

During his tenure as leader of HAMMER, Norman Osborn tries to take control of The World and the Weapon Plus creations. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Noh-Varr]] head to the World to try and stop Norman Osborn but are soon attacked by a large army of Weapon Plus creations infected by Allgod (Weapon XVI), the living religion. Noh-Varr is rescued by [[Fantomex]], who admits he should have kept an eye on The World, and the two of them make their way to The World's brain (now a sentient being) where they are confronted by the Allgod drones, Wolverine included. Noh-Varr is able to disarm Allgod by kissing the World's brain, thus showing it some compassion, and disabling Allgod. Immediately after this, Wolverine regains his senses and the three of them defeat Osborn's invading army of [[Deathlok]] prototypes<ref>"Dark Reign - The List - Wolverine #1"</ref>. 

Spider-Man breaks into Norman's lab, and downloads a video showing Norman using a live human being as a test subject. However he is caught by Norman himself, who was already planning on killing Spider-Man as his last thing on his List. Spider-Man escapes, with Norman, as the Iron Patriot, chasing him. After a long battle, Spider-Man was able to give Norman the slip, and was able to change back into Peter Parker. Peter was than able to upload the video to all his friends online, who are all either in the media or techies. Peter then stands up to the Iron Patriot, claiming that he isn't a real hero. The Patriot soon leaves, citing that he added another name to his list.<ref>"Dark Reign - The List - Amazing Spider-Man #1"</ref>

===Conflict with Molecule Man===

While investigating a number of strange disappearances, Osborn is confronted by [[Molecule Man]], who is seemingly flanked by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Beyonder]], [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and [[Zarathos]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #10</ref> However, it was revealed that these others were merely the Molecule Man's creations, and he began to psychologically and physically torture Osborn and seemingly killed his Avengers.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #11</ref>

===Captain America: Reborn===
HAMMER captures Sin and Crossbones, two associates of the Red Skull, and hold them in Colorado. Sin attacks an agent and whispers something in his ear before Bullseye stops her. It is revealed that she said "Are you sure he is dead?", and Osborn wonders whether she is talking about the Red Skull or Captain America. He meets with Arnim Zola, who explains that Steve Rogers has become unstuck in time and no one knows where he is. Osborn then meets with Sin and Crossbones and offers to set them free in return for getting the Red Skull's mind into Steve Rogers' body. After Bucky Barnes and Black Widow are captured, Osborn holds them prisoner and says that he knows about Sharon Carter and orders Natasha to give a message to Sharon or he will kill Bucky. Bucky escapes, but Sharon turns herself in. With Sharon arrested, Osborn delivers her to the Skull and Doctor Doom, who is helping with the time machine, and the Red Skull manages to take over Steve's body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref>

===Siege: The Cabal===
Osborn decides that the next thing he needs to do is get Asgard out of the United States. Soon after, Osborn gathers the Cabal, with [[Taskmaster]] replacing the defecting Emma Frost and Namor. When Doctor Doom arrives, Osborn requests that he retrieve Namor, and Doom refuses. Osborn uses his secret weapon to attack Doom, who is revealed as a Doombot, unleashing a flurry of robotic locusts upon Avengers Tower. The Cabal disperses, leaving Osborn alone to try to deal with the problem. He is rescued by [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], who destroys the body. When Osborn contacts Doom, Doom tells him not to ever strike him or he's willing to go further. The next day, Osborn attempts to get the authority to invade Asgard, but the President refuses. Loki reappears and gives Osborn on how to obtain the right to attack Asgard: a plan that would even resemble the incident that kicked off the Superhuman Civil War.<ref>''Siege: The Cabal''</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and weaknesses==
The chemical solution devised by Norman Osborn from a formula originally conceived by Professor [[Mendel Stromm]], turned Norman Osborn into the Green Goblin. In the process, he gained superhuman agility, strength, speed, stamina, and dexterity. Additionally, Osborn has gained a "healing factor" allowing him to quickly heal from lethal bodily damage (for example: being stabbed through the chest by large blades or have several pumpkin bombs strapped to his stomach). Aside from his physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already above average intellect, making him a bona fide [[genius]] capable of making progress in advanced areas of [[genetics]], [[robotics]], [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[applied chemistry]]. The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn mentally insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.

===Weapons as the Green Goblin===
The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He travels on his [[bat]]-shaped "[[Goblin Glider]]", an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider. The goblin glider is armed with [[infrared homing|heat-seeking missile]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and retractable blades. Other weapons the Goblin uses are incendiary Pumpkin Bombs capable of melting through {{convert|3|in|mm}} of battleship steel, smoke and gas-emitting bombs with an appearance like a ghost, razor-edged bat-shaped [[boomerang]]s (similar to [[Batman]]'s [[batarang]]s), and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity at nearly 1,000 [[volt]]s. He wears bulletproof [[mail (armour)|chainmail]] with an overlapping tunic and cape. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep himself safe from his own gasses.

'''Pumpkin Bomb''':
A '''Pumpkin Bomb''' is a [[grenade]] used by the Green Goblin. A Pumpkin Bomb looks like a miniature [[Jack-o'-lantern]] and when thrown, ignites almost soundlessly and produce enough heat to melt through a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} thick sheet of [[steel]]. The goblin holds these and a variety of other grenades in a shoulder bag he calls his "Bag Of Tricks". The Green Goblin has a range of other "Pumpkin Bombs" at his disposal. These include smoke and gas-emitting bombs. Some release [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] gases, while others emit a specially created mixture that neutralizes [[Spider-Man]]'s Spider Sense for a limited period of time. All of these are covered in a light plastic mantle that flutter like a wraith when thrown.

===Weapons as the Iron Patriot===
Due to the events of the ''"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]"'' Osborn has created the new identity of the Iron Patriot (an apparent amalgam of [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]]) to cement his standing as a hero. He now utilizes (aside from his organic abilities) a version of Iron Man's [[Iron Man armor#Extremis Armor|Extremis]] Armor (with a different color scheme). The armor grants superhuman strength, enhanced durability (via a pliable crystalline material with a molecular structure that can collimate into super-hard planes upon the application of an electrical field), a flight system, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers and a communications system housed in his helmet which allows interface with any U.S. controlled satellite or computer network. While the Iron Man armor that Osborn based his suit on used repulsor technology, Osborn's does not. Stark destroyed all but one repulsor, and stated that "Oz is too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system.

===Mental illness and other weaknesses===
Norman Osborn has consistently been depicted with several unusual weaknesses related to his psychosis and to his personality. 
He suffers from manic depression. He has a pronounced superiority complex and, in some depictions, multiple-personality disorder. Finally, he is highly sadistic and shows disregard for the lives of innocent people who stand between himself and his objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.

In the pages of the Thunderbolts it is revealed that Norman Osborn is severely [[manic depressive]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #113</ref> This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not under the direction of a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings and at the apex of his mania is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations (such as hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror, rather than his own). As a consequence of Norman Osborn's incredible arrogance, he does not submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced because mental illness is an imperfection in his view and therefore he will not admit he is mentally ill. Not since the formation of the Thunderbolts, has Norman Osborn ever been seen as remotely emotionally stable and even this is tenuous. It has recently been revealed in his conversations with the mentally ill Sentry that Norman has come to accept his own mental illness.

There are many examples of Norman Osborn's highly pronounced superiority complex. He generally views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, who are unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out of his way to remind others of their personal failures and shortcomings, and tends to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. These attributes have consistently been shown in stories featuring this character. For example, when he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that when Spider-Man previously had defeated him, it did not count because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the [[Human Torch]]. He also missed the opportunity to lead the original [[Sinister Six]] because he felt joining the group would be admitting that he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. 

Osborn has demonstrated that he is highly sadistic. While in prison, a guard once asked for his advice in helping his critically ill wife &mdash; Osborn's advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death. As director of the Avengers, he allowed Bullseye to continue to function as a member of the Avengers, even after Bullseye allowed over 30 innocent bystanders to be killed during a skirmish with a supervillain.<ref>''Dark Reign: Hawkeye'' #1</ref> As director of H.A.M.M.E.R. he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see if his enemy, [[Pepper Potts]], was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her variant of the Iron Man armor.<ref>''Invincible Iron-Man'' #11-12</ref> Such actions threaten the hero persona he has carefully crafted with the media as some reporters have started to see him for what he really is, and many of his highly credible former enemies have spoken out against him. His Goblin persona is vying for control of his body, which, during the Dark Reign run in the January 2010 issue of Dark Avengers, after being "ordered" by his second in command, Ms. Hand, to get a psychiatric evaluation, once she leaves his lab, he is seen writhing on the floor and imploring, apparently to himself, "Why won't this face come off...?".{{issue}}

Though suppressing his Goblin persona, Osborn has proven to be evil and cruel without it, often in vastly far reaching and far more complicated and intricate ways than his alter-ego, due to his power and influence as director of H.A.M.M.E.R..
