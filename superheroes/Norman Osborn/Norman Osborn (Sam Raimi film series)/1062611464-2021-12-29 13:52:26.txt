'''Norman Virgil Osborn''' is a [[fictional character]] from [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|trilogy of ''Spider-Man'' films]] and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), adapted from the [[American comic book|comic book]] character [[Norman Osborn|of the same name]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], also known by his [[alter-ego]], the '''[[Green Goblin]]'''. He is portrayed by [[Willem Dafoe]], who also voices the character in the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|video game adaptation]] of the first film.

Norman is introduced in the first ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) film as the CEO of science company [[Oscorp]], and the father of [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry Osborn]]. Norman has a strained relationship with his son and often neglects him in favor of Harry's best friend, [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker]], because he views himself as the only father figure in the boy's life after his [[Uncle Ben]] is killed. 

When Oscorp faces financial difficulties and Norman is pressured to secure a government contract to save it from bankruptcy, he tests an unstable performance-enhancement serum on himself, developing enhanced physical abilities and a [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]]. This new persona, later dubbed the "'''Green Goblin'''", occasionally takes over Norman's body to exact revenge on their enemies, using advanced military equipment stolen from Oscorp. He later comes into conflict with Spider-Man, and eventually discovers that he is Peter, but accidentally kills himself while fighting him. Norman's Green Goblin persona appears posthumously in the sequels ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), as a hallucination enticing Harry, who assumed Spider-Man killed his father, to take revenge on the hero. Dafoe reprised the role in the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), in which Norman is transported there right before his death along with four other villains due to a magic spell gone wrong, and ends up clashing with that universe's [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Spider-Man]] and his allies.

Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin was critically praised, and the character is considered to be one of the most iconic villains in superhero films.

===Design, casting and execution===
[[File:OriginalGreenGoblin.jpg|thumb|The original animatronic headgear for the Green Goblin was created by [[Amalgamated Dynamics]]]]
During development of what would eventually become ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), [[David Koepp]]'s rewrites of [[James Cameron]]'s original script had the [[Green Goblin]] as the main antagonist and added [[Doctor Octopus]] as the secondary antagonist.<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= Edward |title= Spider-Man Confidential |pages=208–209 |publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] |date=May 2002 |isbn= 0-7868-8722-2 }}</ref> Incoming director [[Sam Raimi]] felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father-son theme between [[Norman Osborn]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], influenced by the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Green Goblin (Ultimate Marvel character)|version of the character]], would be more interesting, thus, he dropped Doctor Octopus from the film.<ref name="trivia track">{{cite video | title = Subtitled Factoids: Weaving the Web | type = DVD | publisher = Sony |year = 2002}}</ref> In June 2000, [[Columbia Pictures]] hired [[Scott Rosenberg]] to rewrite Koepp's material.

Dafoe later called his role as the Green Goblin one of his favorites throughout his career, having enjoyed playing the unhinged character particularly due to his dual personalities, and balancing between a dramatic and comedic performance. In particular, he enjoyed the mirror scene in which Norman Osborn discovers and converses with the Green Goblin persona after murdering the Oscorp board of directors. Sam Raimi had given Dafoe a copy of [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]] to prepare for the scene, which was filmed in one take multiple times before Raimi decided to split it; to further differentiate the personas, Dafoe wore dental prosthetics presenting the character with straight teeth whenever portraying Norman, only exposing his natural crooked teeth when portraying the Goblin.<ref name="Dafoe enjoyment">{{Cite web |last=Holmes |first=Adam |date=2019-02-19 |title=Willem Dafoe Really Loved Playing The Green Goblin In Spider-Man |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467144/willem-dafoe-really-loved-playing-the-green-goblin-in-spider-man |access-date=2020-08-25 |website=CINEMABLEND |archive-date=2020-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620044024/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467144/willem-dafoe-really-loved-playing-the-green-goblin-in-spider-man |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiMguaZQREUt=202s |title=Willem Dafoe Breaks Down His Most Iconic Characters – GQ |date=February 15, 2019 |type=Video |language=en|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

To prevent his involvement in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021) from leaking and preserve the film's secrecy, Dafoe was required to walk around the set with a cloak covering his costume. [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]] actor [[Tom Holland]] first met Dafoe when he accidentally bumped into Dafoe before filming, reacting surprised upon seeing who the cloaked actor was, Holland then-unaware of his casting in the film.<ref name="VillainsSetSecrecy">{{Cite web |last=Oddo |first=Marco Vito |date=November 23, 2021 |title=Tom Holland Reveals How 'No Way Home' Kept the Returning Villains a Secret |url=https://collider.com/spider-man-no-way-home-villains-secret-explained-tom-holland/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211124033954/https://collider.com/spider-man-no-way-home-villains-secret-explained-tom-holland/ |archive-date=November 24, 2021 |access-date=November 30, 2021 |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>

===Costume design===
Before settling on the look used in the film, the original headgear created for the Green Goblin was an [[animatronic]] mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics. The design was much more faithful to the comics than the finished product, and allowed for a full range of emotions to be expressed by the wearer. Ultimately, the mask was scrapped before an actor was chosen to play the Green Goblin, and a static, military-grade helmet was produced for the film instead, due to the animatronic concept being deemed "too creepy" by studio executives and due to technical difficulties and constraints.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Ryan |title='Spider-Man': Willem Dafoe's Original Green Goblin Mask Was Amazing |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-willem-dafoes-original-green-goblin-mask-was-amazing-1019532 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=October 4, 2018 |archive-date=October 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004190007/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-willem-dafoes-original-green-goblin-mask-was-amazing-1019532 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lammers |first1=Timothy |title=Spider-Man's Green Goblin Mask Was Originally Far More Comic Accurate |url=https://screenrant.com/raimi-spider-man-green-goblin-accurate-mask-dafoe/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=October 4, 2018 |archive-date=October 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004185734/https://screenrant.com/raimi-spider-man-green-goblin-accurate-mask-dafoe/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Behind the scenes">{{Cite web |last=Hutchinson |first=Sam |date=2020-06-01 |title=Spider-Sense: 10 Behind-The-Scenes Details Of Sam Raimi Trilogy Fans Never Knew |url=https://screenrant.com/spider-man-sam-raimi-tobey-maguire-trilogy-trivia/ |access-date=2020-08-25 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US |archive-date=2020-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200618102014/https://screenrant.com/spider-man-sam-raimi-tobey-maguire-trilogy-trivia/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Characterization and themes==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2021}}
[[File:Norman Osborn Willem Dafoe.png|thumb|200px|Norman Osborn during the iconic "mirror scene"]]
As portrayed in the Sam Raimi film series, Norman Osborn is a workaholic scientist/businessman, who has a complicated relationship with his son Harry. A career-focused man who prioritizes science, business and success above all else and despite genuinely caring for his son, has a distant relationship with him and is quite disappointed in Harry, who is meant to be Norman's heir, but lacks his father's ambition, intellect, strength and will to succeed and control.

The Green Goblin is Norman Osborn's second personality, born because of the exposure to the experimental performance-enhancing gas. The Green Goblin may perhaps be the unrestrained manifestation of Norman Osborn's ambition for power, desire to succeed, and hatred for anyone who may be a hindrance to his control, such as greedy contractors and board members, and his destined enemy, the superhero Spider-Man. He is a violent, sadistic and unhinged psychopath and an over-ambitious maniac who believes that his power gives him endless potential and places him above normal people. He even attempts to invite Spider-Man to join him, believing that as another powerful being, they both could accomplish many things together. He refuses to give any value to human life and kills whomever stands in his way without hesitation. Although his mental stability has been badly damaged, the Green Goblin is extremely intelligent and clever, making him even more dangerous.

In the comics, Norman Osborn is either depicted as having [[dissociative identity disorder|dual personalities]] (in original/classic depictions of the Spider-Man mythos) or utilizing the Goblin persona as a mask for his villainous deeds and being truly evil (as in later depictions), depending on the writer. The films went with the former route, making the Goblin personality separate from Norman's normal personality.<ref name="Dafoe enjoyment" />

Writing in 2020, James Whitbrook of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' contrasts [[Tobey Maguire]]'s Peter Parker / Spider-Man with Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn / Green Goblin and [[James Franco]]'s Harry Osborn in the way they choose to exercise their power in the film series, as he notes that the leading men in the series appear to hold some form of power. While Peter learns to tame his abilities and [[With great power comes great responsibility|accept the responsibility that comes with it]], Norman gives into fear of losing his prestigious position at his company, choosing to pursue an alternate power in the form of inadvertently becoming the Green Goblin. As a result, he attacks his former colleagues and the people he cares about, namely Harry and Peter, while descending further into madness and insanity.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Whitbrook |first=James |date=2020-08-02 |title=Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a Cautionary Tale About the Power Men Wield |url=https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2020/08/sam-raimis-spider-man-is-a-cautionary-tale-about-the-power-men-wield/ |access-date=2020-08-25 |website=Gizmodo UK |language=en |archive-date=2020-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805081353/https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2020/08/sam-raimis-spider-man-is-a-cautionary-tale-about-the-power-men-wield/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Becoming the Green Goblin===
{{Further|Spider-Man (2002 film)}}
Osborn first appears at the beginning of the film where he drops his son [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry]] off to a school field trip and tells him not to be ashamed of himself, it is evident that they have somewhat of a strained relationship. Osborn is then introduced to Harry's best friend [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker]] and quickly takes a liking to him, impressed with his intelligence.

After hearing his colleague Dr. [[Mendel Stromm]] reveal to the military officials overseeing the project that some of the test subjects have gone insane, Osborn is threatened with a tight deadline, and experiments on himself. The process ends up developing an alternate, crazed personality of Osborn, and he kills Stromm. The military decides to give the super-soldier contract to another company, Quest Aerospace, and in revenge, a crazed Osborn, under the influence of the new Goblin persona, steals an Oscorp suit and glider, killing several high-ranking military officers and Quest scientists present at the test. Although Quest Aerospace's prototype is destroyed, the company decides to expand and, in doing so, assumes control of Oscorp on the condition that Osborn steps down as CEO. The Goblin kills Oscorp's board of directors during a festival in [[Times Square]], thus removing the last threat to his control of Oscorp, and inadvertently almost killing [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]] and meets [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Spider-Man]].

The Goblin leads an attack at the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' editor-in-chief [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who has dubbed his crazed split personality as the "[[Green Goblin]]", for who takes pictures of Spider-Man. The Goblin offers Spider-Man a partnership and belittles his choice to become a hero, warning that eventually, the city will turn against him. The Goblin baits Spider-Man to a burning apartment, and demands Spider-Man's choice, to which the latter refuses to work with him. After Osborn deduces Spider-Man is Peter Parker, despite begging the Goblin not to hurt him, he then attacks and hospitalizes Parker's [[aunt May]], and later kidnaps Mary Jane thanks to his son, [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry]]. The Goblin makes Spider-Man choose between saving Mary Jane and a [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]] car full of children, but Parker saves both. The Goblin brutally beats Spider-Man, threatening to make Mary Jane's death "nice and slow", but an enraged Parker brutally counterattacks the Goblin. The Goblin tries to fool Peter and takes off his mask to reveal Osborn to Parker, while slowly raising his glider to attack him, and stating that Parker was like a son to him. After Parker retorts that his true father is [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], the Goblin attempts to impale Parker with his bladed glider, but the latter senses the attack coming and dodges, allowing the glider to instead fatally stab Osborn, whose last words are a request for Parker to not tell Harry about his actions.

===As a hallucination===
{{Further|Spider-Man 2|Spider-Man 3}}
Two years later, Harry discovers Parker is Spider-Man, and meets Osborn, now a living hallucination. Osborn states that Harry should avenge him, while Harry is reluctant to kill his best friend. Harry shatters the mirror and discovers a hidden lair containing Green Goblin equipment and technology.

One year later, Harry becomes the "[[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|New Goblin]]" in honor of Osborn's legacy. Osborn's presence appears after Harry recovers his memories after his first encounter with Parker, reminding Harry to avenge him and to go after Parker's heart. However, Harry eventually finds out the truth about his father's death and gives up his vendetta against Parker, helping him in a battle against [[Flint Marko (Sam Raimi film series)|Flint Marko / Sandman]] and [[Eddie Brock (Sam Raimi film series)|Eddie Brock / Venom]] and giving his own life to save his friend.

===Entering a different reality===
{{Further|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}
In [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|another universe]], due to a malfunction in Dr. [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]]'s spell to erase the world's memory of [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Spider-Man]]'s identity, Osborn, before his death, is brought to their reality, as he is aware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. He encounters the alternate Parker and [[Otto Octavius (film character)|Otto Octavius]] at the [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]].{{efn|In an act of [[retroactive continuity]], after recognizing Norman Osborn in his Green Goblin suit at the [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]], [[Otto Octavius (film character)|Otto Octavius]] and [[Flint Marko (Sam Raimi film series)|Flint Marko]] inform [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the alternate Peter Parker]] that Osborn's identity as the Goblin was made public knowledge upon his original death in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), known to Octavius by ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004), and known to Marko sometime after the events of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), the former film in which Norman's son [[Harry Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Harry]] had been in [[denial]] over his father's true identity before its conclusion.}} Afterwards, Osborn abandons his Goblin mask and persona and runs away, retrieved by F.E.A.S.T. and treated by Parker's aunt [[May Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|May]] after finding Oscorp not to exist in this universe. Parker works to make cures for Osborn, Octavius, [[Flint Marko (Sam Raimi film series)|Flint Marko / Sandman]], [[Lizard (character)#Film|Curt Connors / Lizard]], and [[Max Dillon (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Max Dillon / Electro]], but the Green Goblin takes over Osborn's mind once again and betrays the group. He fights Peter and kills May during his escape.

After Marko, Dillon and Connors are cured, the Goblin attacks at the [[Statue of Liberty]] and destroys Strange's spell-containing relic, causing the barriers between universes to break. While Strange attempts to seal the barriers, an enraged Parker nearly kills the Goblin in battle before he is stopped by Osborn's Peter Parker. Parker injects a cure into the Goblin, turning him back to a remorseful Norman Osborn. Strange casts a spell to make everyone forget Peter Parker's existence, causing Osborn to return to his universe.

==In other media==
===Television===
This version of Norman Osborn is mentioned in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'', a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated television series which serves as a loose alternate continuation of the first ''Spider-Man'' film. As in the films, Harry holds a grudge against Spider-Man for his father's death, and is not aware of Norman's criminal activities as the Green Goblin.

===Video games===
*Norman Osborn/Green Goblin appears in the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|video game adaptation]] of the 2002 film, with Willem Dafoe reprising his role in a vocal capacity, making him and [[Tobey Maguire]] the only two actors from the film to do so.
*This version of Norman Osborn appears in his Green Goblin persona in the 2007 game ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Roger L. Jackson]]. In this alternative timeline where all the villains from the ''Spider-Man'' films survived their supposed deaths, the Goblin is present during their attempt to kill Spider-Man in the game's opening [[cutscene]]. Harry is also present and assists Spider-Man as the New Goblin, not acknowledging that his father is among the villains at any point. After the battle, the group is attacked by a swarm of P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s, and the villains, including the Goblin, are suddenly teleported elsewhere while Spider-Man is rescued by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The Goblin is then brainwashed by [[Mysterio|the villainous mastermind]] behind the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s and sent to [[Tokyo]] to retrieve one of the meteor shard used to create the P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s. There, the player fights him on top of the city's Oscorp tower, and Spider-Man destroys his mind-controlling amulet, restoring his free will. Afterward, the Goblin, seeking revenge on whoever brainwashed him, reluctantly joins forces with Spider-Man, and becomes a playable character for the remainder of the game.

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Willem Dafoe Cannes.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Willem Dafoe]] at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Willem Dafoe's role in the first ''Spider-Man'' film was widely well-received, including a ''[[New York Daily News]]'' reviewer who felt he put "the scare in archvillain" and [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' who deemed him "strong support".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mathews|first1=Jack|title=What A Wondrous Web They Weave|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/wondrous-web-weave-article-1.479105|website=[[New York Daily News]]|access-date=April 11, 2018|date=May 3, 2002|archive-date=April 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412082020/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/wondrous-web-weave-article-1.479105|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bradhsaw|first1=Peter|title=Spider-Man|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/14/1|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=April 11, 2018|date=June 14, 2002|archive-date=December 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210071949/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/14/1|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=A.

Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression."<ref>{{cite web | first = Richard | last = George | title = Spider-Man in Film: Volume One | website = IGN | date = April 19, 2007 |url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p3.html | access-date = April 27, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017233239/http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p3.html | archive-date = October 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Despite some criticism of the costume, Dafoe's rendition of the Green Goblin is now acclaimed as one of the greatest superhero film villains.
