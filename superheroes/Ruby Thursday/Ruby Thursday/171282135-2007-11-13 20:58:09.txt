'''Ruby Thursday''' ('''Thursday Rubinstein''') a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe and a member of the [[Headmen]].  

She was a scientist who grafted an organic computer to her head composed of melleable plastic that can assume any form she wills it to.  She ran for [[President of the United States]], but was forced to drop out by the Defenders.  She later indirectly caused the death of [[Omega the Unknown]] when he was considered by police to be assaulting her in her car. 

The police were unaware of her previous actions, including killing people with a large purple creature called Dibbuk (named after, but unrelated to a [[dybbuk]]).

The confrontration with Omega led Ruby into another fight with the Defenders. This ended when her head was smashed open. It is not known how Ruby survived this damage.

Ruby, now with a much smaller head, later participated in the plan to gain her ally Chondu a new body. Specifically, the body of a clone of [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen hired the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, then later [[Mysterio]] in order to test She-Hulk for compatabillity. She was subdued and cloned, but would escape with the aid of Spider-Man. Ruby was arrested by the New York city police. 

The assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] was hired to Kill Ruby. He did so by throwing the [[Rolling Stones]] album [[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]] into her chest.<ref>''[[I ♥ Marvel|I ♥ Marvel: Outlaw Love]]''</ref>
