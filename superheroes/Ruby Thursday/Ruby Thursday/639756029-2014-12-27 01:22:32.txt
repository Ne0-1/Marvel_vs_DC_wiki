==Fictional character biography==
Thursday was a scientist who grafts an organic computer to her head composed of malleable plastic that can assume any form she wills it to. She ran for [[President of the United States]], but is forced to drop out by the superhero team known as the Defenders.{{issue|date=December 2010}}  She later indirectly causes the death of [[Omega the Unknown]] when he was considered by police to be assaulting her in her car. The police were unaware of her previous actions, including killing people with a large purple creature called Dibbuk (named after, but unrelated to a [[dybbuk]]).<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #10</ref>

The confrontation with Omega leads Ruby into another fight with the Defenders. This ended when her head was smashed open.<ref>''Defenders'' #77</ref> It is not known how Ruby survived this damage.

Ruby, now with a much smaller head, later participates in the plan to gain her ally Chondu a new body. Specifically, the body of a clone of [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen hire the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, then later [[Mysterio]] in order to test She-Hulk for compatibility. She is subdued and cloned, but escapes with the aid of Spider-Man.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #1-3 (May–July 1989)</ref> Ruby is arrested by the New York city police.

The assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] is hired to kill Ruby. He throws the [[Rolling Stones]] album [[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]] (which contains the song [[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]) into her chest. The [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], her boyfriend, saves her head after Bullseye leaves in hopes of reviving her later.<ref>''[[I ♥ Marvel|I ♥ Marvel: Outlaw Love]]''</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Ruby later is involved in a high speed 'chase' through the streets of Manhattan. The super-heroine [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] ends up clinging to her bumper. Ruby uses her malleable head to fire a gun at Hellcat during the pursuit. The fight is ended with the intervention of She-Hulk and her allies. She-Hulk does not actually go for Ruby, she takes down Hellcat first for being an unlicensed superhero. The results of Ruby's rampage are shown in the forms of cars being shot up, people traumatized by this, and a cab ending up through the front window of a bookstore. Ruby herself is subdued by the weaponry of [[Two-Gun Kid]], a licensed bounty hunter for the state of New York.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10, Oct. 2006</ref>

Ruby and the Headmen then fought the [[Heroes for Hire]] while attempting to transplant [[Chondu the Mystic|Chondu]]'s head onto [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]'s body.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #6-8</ref> At some point, she was imprisoned in The Raft, which Wolverine broke her out of in his plan against  Romulus.  Ruby was contacted by Romulus and her daughter's life was threatened, forcing her to give Romulus the information to Wolverine's plans.  When confronted by Wolverine, Ruby attacked, defeating him by impaling him with the tentacles she had formed with her head. Soon, Cloak, Silver Samurai,  Skaar, and Bruce Banner appeared, all battling Ruby Thursday. She held her own, but was eventually caught by Skaar and teleported back to The Raft by Cloak. It was later discovered The Answer is the one who had planned her escape.<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ruby Thursday’s head has been replaced with a mass of “organic circuitry”. The red spherical mass can alter its shape so she can form tentacles, fire projectiles and fire blasts of pure force. If the sphere is removed from the body Ruby can still control her body.
