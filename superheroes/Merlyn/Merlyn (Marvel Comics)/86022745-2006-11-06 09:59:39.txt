'''Merlyn''' is a [[fiction]]al character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He claims to be the [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] of British Legends (see Notes) and has served for many years as the Omniversal Guardian, a function his daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] now fulfills.
He first appeared in ''Captain Britain'' #1 (1976), though the legendary Merlin, who might be one and the same, first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #134.

==Character history==
Merlyn was born on an [[Marvel Comics Multiverse|alternate earth]] as a member of a race of immortal, powerful beings. He became the student of [[Necrom]], his world's [[Sorcerer Supreme]]. Necrom asked Merlyn and his fellow-student [[Feron]] to assist him in a magical ritual. Feron would contact the cosmic [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] on [[Earth 616]] and using the Phoenix an alignment would be created between parallel universes. This assignment would be marked with a tower in the same place on every Earth in the [[Omniverse]]. According to magical principles, such an alignment would create a matrix of nearly endless magical energy. Necrom desired the power of the Phoenix for himself though and he attacked Feron. Feron, his powers enhanced by the Phoenix battled his master and Merlyn used the opportunity to jump into the Matrix, taking its power for his own. Necrom wounded the Phoenix and escaped with a small part of it. The Phoenix left Feron and Feron stayed behind on Earth 616, dedicating his life to asking the Phoenix for forgiveness. 

Merlyn travelled to Otherworld and established himself as Omniversal Guardian, safeguarding the total of all universes in existence. With the powers of the Matrix, Merlyn dedicated himself to protecting the universe and finding Necrom. Necrom hid and planned for the next few centuries, changing the part of the Phoenix Force that he had stolen into the ''Anti-Phoenix''. Merlyn founded the [[Captain Britain Corps]], a group of matrix-powered superheroes based on each Earth in the omniverse. Merlyn sent his best agent, Sir James Braddock, to Earth 616 to father a hero. James' first son, [[Jamie Braddock]], was unsuitable for Merlyn's purposes, but the twins [[Psylocke|Elisabeth]] and [[Captain Britain|Brian]] both were. Merlyn chose Brian to become Earth 616's Captain Britain and he would be pivotal to Merlyn's plans. 

Over the years, Merlyn manipulated Brian to become a stronger and wiser hero. He partnered Brian with [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|the Black Knight]], another of Merlyn's champions, to teach him more about magic. Merlyn used Brian to stop [[Mad Jim Jaspers]], a reality warper who threatened the fabric of the multiverse itself. Merlyn seemingly died in the battle between Jaspers and [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|the Fury]]. Merlyn was buried and Roma took over as Omniversal Guardian. 

Merlyn faked his death though and hid, even from his daughter. In secret he manipulated his daughter and Captain Britain to form [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], a team of superheroes, who would become his weapon against Necrom. Excalibur would take the tower that was part of the Matrix as their base, not knowing the true meaning of this building. Necrom resurfaced and fought Excalibur. In the battle, [[Rachel Summers]] killed Necrom and Merlyn appeared to congratulate Excalibur. Excalibur was furious at Merlyn for manipulating them and endangering them all. Roma, also disappointed in her father's callous behaviour, assisted Excalibur in destroying their tower and by extension the Matrix. Merlyn left in rage at losing his source of power. 

Merlyn and [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] both met occasionally on Otherworld, but Merlyn didn't retake his position as Omniversal Guardian, trusting his daughter to protect the Omniverse. He was nowhere to be seen when [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] took over Otherworld or during the [[House of M]]. His current whereabouts and motivations are unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Merlyn has vast magical abilities and is immortal. He can create illusions, change his shape, observe other realities, raise the dead and manipulate energy. Sometimes he uses advanced technology to help him.

==Notes==
*Merlyn is but one of several characters in the Marvel Universe claiming to be the Merlin of legend. Combined with the fact that Merlyn is also a habitual liar and manipulator, makes it nearly impossible to determine which actions were done by Merlyn and which by other Merlins. This page only deals with the confirmed actions of Merlyn.
