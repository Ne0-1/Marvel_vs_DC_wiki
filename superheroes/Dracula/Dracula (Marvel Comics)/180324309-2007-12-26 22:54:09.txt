'''Dracula''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Gene Colan]] in 1972.

== Publication History ==

Dracula [[First appearance|first appears]] in a [[Atlas Comics]] publication.<ref>''Suspense'' #7</ref> 

In Marvel Comics, Dracula appeared in a ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' comic<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' ran from issue #1 to #70</ref> which ended in 1979.

Although Dracula (and all other vampires in the Marvel Universe) were eventually destroyed by the mystical "Montesi Formula" in the pages of ''Doctor Strange'', the vampire lord was revived. Marvel published a four-issue ''Tomb of Dracula'' [[miniseries]], reuniting Wolfman and Colan, under its [[Epic Comics]] imprint in 1991, and revived Dracula and his foes in the short-lived ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]'' and ''[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'' series in the [[1990s]]. Most recently, Dracula took the title role in the miniseries ''Dracula: Lord of the Undead''.

''[[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] vs. Dracula'' featured Dracula battling the immortal foe of the X-Men in Victorian London.

==Fictional character biography==
Born Vlad Dracula in 1430 in Schassburg, Transylvania (now [[Sighişoara]], [[Romania]]), as the second son of a Transylvanian nobleman. He was named prince of [[Wallachia]] and became ruler while still a child. Over the next several years, he struggled against the Ottoman Turks, losing and regaining his throne. Through an arranged marriage to a Hungarian noblewoman, he sired his daughter, [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)|Lilith]].  He sent his wife away and later married a woman named Maria, with whom he had a son named Vlad Tepelus. He had a son with his third wife Domini named Janus.

In 1459, Dracula was mortally wounded by the Turkish warlord [[Turac]], who brought Dracula to a gypsy named Lianda to be healed. However, Lianda was a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], and transformed Dracula into a vampire as well. Turac raped and killed Maria, and in revenge Dracula slew Turac, causing him to become a vampire. Dracula gave his son Vlad Tepelus to gypsies to raise.

Dracula defeated the vampire [[Nimrod (vampire)|Nimrod]] in battle, and thus succeeded him at ruler of Earth’s vampires. Soon afterwards, he enhanced his own blood with that of [[Varnae]], giving him greater powers than any other vampire. In 1471, Dracula abdicated his princehood.

In the [[19th century]], he faced opposition from Abraham van Helsing and Jonathan Harker in England, the exploits of which were recorded in the 1897 novel by Stoker, ''Dracula''.  When the humans destroyed Dracula, his remains were placed in his coffin, concealed within a cave blocked by an enormous boulder. In ''[[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]]'', the behemoth in the story was tricked into unsealing the cave and opening the coffin, thus, freeing Dracula.

In the [[20th century]], Dracula encountered numerous opponents, including [[Quincy Harker]] and [[Rachel van Helsing]], the descendants of his enemies described by Stoker, vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], his only known living descendant [[Frank Drake]], vampiric detective [[Hannibal King]], [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Doctor Sun]], the [[X-Men]], and others. Just before [[World War I]], he was responsible for transforming Lord John Falsworth into [[Baron Blood]]. Doctor Strange destroyed Dracula and all of Earth’s vampires by casting the Montesi Formula<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #62</ref>, though Dracula eventually returned.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Rachel van Helsing.jpg|thumb|215px|Dracula attempting to vampirize [[Rachel van Helsing]]<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #40</ref>]]

Dracula possesses far greater powers than most vampires. He has [[superhuman strength]] (to the point of standing toe to toe, and defeating, the X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] in single combat), [[Vampire: The Requiem#Physical|celerity]], [[shapeshifting]], [[Flight#In fiction|flight]] (which is a usual attribution to most vampires with shapechanging abilities, see [[Vampire fiction#Traits of vampires in fiction|vampires in fiction]]), superhuman stamina, agility and reflexes; he is [[Immortality|immune to aging]], conventional disease, sickness and most forms of injury.

He ignores most assaults and can rapidly [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate damaged tissue]]; 

Dracula can [[Mind control|manipulate the minds of others]]; commanding the minds of animals such as rodents, bats and wolves alike. With limited exceptions, he may control other vampires. He is capable of transforming into a bat — normal or human size — and into a [[fog]] or [[mist]] — partially or fully — and has the ability of [[weather control]], such as summoning [[Thunderstorm|electrical storm]]s. Like some vampires in other works of fiction, Dracula does not cast reflections.  His powers have  been greatly amplified and his weaknesses circumvented by magical sources, such as spells of the Darkholders.

Dracula is also a skilled combatant and swordsman, specializing in [[15th century]] warfare and militaristic strategy. He has a gifted [[intellect]].

==Other Media==
Dracula appeared in the ''[[Spider-Woman (TV series)|Spider-Woman]]'' episode "Dracula's Revenge."

In 1980, an animated [[TV-movie]] was made based on ''Tomb of Dracula''. Much of the main plot was condensed and many characters and subplots were truncated or omitted. It was animated in [[Japan]] and sparsely released on cable TV in [[North America]] by [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] under the title ''Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned''.

Dracula appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episode "The Transylvania Connection" (AKA "The Bride of Dracula") voiced by [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]].

===Blade: Trinity===

Dracula appears as the main villain in ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' portrayed by [[Dominic Purcell]] and under the name "Drake."

Drake was [[resurrection|resurrected]] by a cadre of [[Vampire (Blade)|vampire]] followers to help them in their plan to transform them into [[daywalker]]s. While Blade and Abigail are out hunting, Drake finds their base of operations, killing the entire staff, and capturing Hannibal, who was injured in their last encounter. In a desperate attempt to rescue him, both Blade and Abigail storm his [[skyscraper]] fortress, and confront him. After a prolonged battle, Blade draws Drake's blood and releases the '''Daystar''', a [[Biological warfare|bioweapon]] that will that will wipe out all vampires. In a show of respect, he allowed Blade to escape upon his death, assuming his [[identity]] for several hours while dead. 

====Powers and abilities in Blade: Trinity====
Drake's origins are never stated although he claims to have been alive when [[Jesus]] was crucified.
Given Drake's age and origin, he, more than any other Vampire that followed, can harness a much greater and more dynamic range of abilities. He possesses unnatural strength, much greater than that of Blade, and also incredible speed. Like those he sired he is capable of leaping great distances and seems to be knowledgeable of sword fighting techniques, even rivaling Blade himself.

Drake's true power though is derived from his origin as the first of his species.Unlike the rest of the vampires,Drake can walk in sunlight like Blade.He also has the '''Shapeshifting''' ability,Because his body structure and skin are not like that of a human or a vampire,but they are close to that of a snake,and his body structure consists of thousands of tiny bones,which allows him to take the shape of other people.The manipulation of energies which lead to his first resurrection left Drake with two forms; human, and a demonic alter ego.

In his demonic alter-ego form, Drake is much stronger, resilient to all forms of damage and much taller than his human self. He also possesses very keen senses, at one point allowing him to catch an arrow mid-flight.

Drake can see in total darkness, whereas it appears pure bloods can see with minimal (below the perception of the human eye) light, and turned vampires cannot (requiring as much light as humans to see). 

Drake's demonic alter ego has three-way jaws and a leech-like sucker similar to those seen possessed by the Reapers in [[Blade II]].
