'''James Proudstar''', previously known as the second '''Thunderbird''' but also known as '''Warpath''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]].

An [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Proudstar possesses [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhuman strength and speed, like his older brother, the short-lived X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], though Warpath's power-levels are much higher.

He originally blamed the X-Men for his brother’s death and joined the [[supervillain|villain]] group the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] to get revenge. He later reconsidered his views and became a longtime member of the militant X-Men offshoot [[X-Force]].  After a long journey to the Shi'ar Empire with the [[Uncanny X-Men]], Warpath became a member of the new incarnation of X-Force but he left after the events of Necrosha.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared as the second Thunderbird in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #16 ([[1984 in comics#June|June 1984]]).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
James Proudstar was born on the Apache reservation at [[Camp Verde, Arizona]].  James' brother, [[Thunderbird (comics)|John Proudstar]], was one of the "All New, All Different" [[X-Men]].<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975)</ref> John was killed on one of the team's earliest missions. James angrily blamed the X-Men for his brother's death and made it his life's mission to murder its founder, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]].

===Taking retribution===
James' hatred of the X-Men made him an ideal recruit for [[Emma Frost]]'s Hellions, a team intended to be her answer to Charles Xavier's New Mutants. The Hellions were students at Frost's [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]]; as a Hellion, James clashed with the [[New Mutants]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #16-17</ref>  His hatred led him to attack the X-Men on his own, with the unexpected, and unwanted, aid of [[Roulette (Marvel Comics)|Roulette]], [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], and [[Firestar]]. James donned his brother's costume, and kidnapped the X-Men member [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]] where John was killed. However, when the opportunity arrived, James was unable to kill Professor X in cold blood. James was reconciled with the X-Men, and Professor X offered membership into the New Mutants to James, but he declined.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985)</ref>

===A quiet life interrupted===
Months later, James came to realize that the Massachusetts Academy wasn't the place for him. So, he left to return home to his family's [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. James enjoyed his stay at home so much, that he originally turned down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s offer to join the [[New Mutants]]. After the meeting, in [[New York]], James returned home, to find his entire tribe murdered. James originally thought that the Hellions committed the act to punish him for leaving the team, due to a foot soldier's mask he found alongside the bodies of his fallen tribesmen. He then joined the New Mutants, hoping to track down the Hellions and gain revenge.<ref>''New Mutants'' #99</ref>

===X-Force===
Before long, the New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and became the militant adventurers known as [[X-Force]] and James changed his codename to Warpath. Alongside X-Force, Warpath first battled the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].<ref>''X-Force'' #1</ref> Alongside X-Force and [[Spider-Man]], he battled the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''X-Force'' #3-4</ref> With the team, he fought the likes of [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]],<ref>''X-Force'' #6-7, 9</ref> and then [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]]<ref>''X-Force'' #13</ref> X-Force rescued [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] from [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]],<ref>''X-Force'' #15</ref> and fought the X-Men and the second incarnation of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], being taken prisoner by them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #294-295; ''X-Factor'' #84; ''X-Force'' #16-19</ref> Warpath later traveled to Nova Roma to tell [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] that most of the other Hellions were dead.<ref>''New Warriors'' #31</ref> With [[Tabitha Smith|Boomer]] and [[Siryn]], he was taken prisoner by Gideon and the [[Externals]]; they were rescued by their X-Force teammates.<ref>''X-Force'' #21, 23</ref> Warpath was a part of X-Force for the duration of the team. As a member of X-Force, James became more calm and controlled and struck up a close friendship with his teammate [[Siryn|Theresa Rourke Cassidy]]. Despite his strong attraction to her, Theresa only saw James as a friend.

===Coming to terms with life===
James finally had a face to face meeting with Emma Frost. The two talked about the deaths of his tribesmen, but Emma swore she wasn't involved.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Warpath eventually met a woman, by the name of [[Risque (comics)|Risque]]. Risque was instrumental in helping James with his confidence and the two began a love affair.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}  However, Risque was being blackmailed by a man named Sledge, who forced her to drug Warpath and bring him to his lair.  Sledge gave him information about a member of the tribe that was still alive, but in turn James had to retrieve his partner, the [[Vanisher]], who had disappeared in another dimension.  Sledge hints at abilities within James that make him adept at surviving in this alternate dimension, which is corroborated by a mysterious being in the dimension under the guise of Coyote (James's childhood pet cat),{{Issue|date=September 2010}} but these abilities are never expanded upon.  James found the Vanisher and in turn Sledge gave information on one of his tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, whom James had presumed deceased.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}  Whitecloud told him that [[Stryfe]], X-Force's adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James went to [[Hell]] to gain revenge, but was returned to the living world by [[Blackheart]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}  When James found out Risque's involvement in the whole ordeal, he ended their relationship despite her deepest remorse.  She would eventually reunite with X-Force on several occasions as an ally.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

===X-Corporation===
After X-Force's disintegration, Warpath joined the [[Mumbai]] branch of the international mutant agency, [[X-Corporation]], in [[India]]. His new team was a mix of old and new friends: [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], and [[Thornn]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He stayed there with the X-Corporation for a while, helping to save Professor X's life, who was surprised that he was still alive.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

===X-Force Reunion===
A threat from Cable's past comes back to haunt him, when a group of time-traveling ninjas called the Helix attack him and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. The Helix worship a demon called the [[Skornn]], which Cable had defeated before. After defeating the Helix, they go in search of the Five Fingers of Annihilation, a blade that is the only thing that can kill the Skornn. They meet up with Shatterstar, and are then attacked by more Helix ninjas.<ref>''X-Force vol.2'' #1</ref> The threat proves more than he and Domino can handle, so they enlist the help of Warpath, Sunspot, and Meltdown. Warpath tells Cable that he and Sunspot have responsibilities with the X-Corporation, and doesn't really want to be involved with him. Cable explains that he needs people that he can trust on his team. They all agree to join Cable, and go onto to help [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] who is being approached by another time traveler.<ref>''X-Force vol.2'' #2</ref> X-Force is eventually joined by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and the [[Fantastic Four]]. They fight the Skornn, and eventually Cable kills it once again.<ref>''X-Force vol.2'' #6</ref> X-Force disbands, with Warpath apparently returning to the X-Corporation.

===X-Men===
Warpath was one of the few mutants to retain their powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], and soon after found himself living in the Mutant camp at the [[X-Mansion]].  Shortly afterwards, he joined the ranks of the X-Men for the first time at [[Professor X]]'s request.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #475</ref> Along with [[Professor X]], [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], he journeys into space to track down [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. He shows his superb fighting prowess while fighting cyborg drones as the X-Men attempt to commandeer a [[Shi'ar]] ship.  During the final fight with Vulcan,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #486''</ref> Warpath fought bravely and in the end was on the spaceship with half of the team when [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] sent it back to Earth.

Since she is stuck on Earth and has nowhere else to go, [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]] joins Professor X's team of X-Men. She and Warpath have already created a bond of sorts, with Hepzibah remarking that his presence has helped her through her mourning of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]]. Together, they confront one of the X-Mansion's guardian Sentinels when [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a long time X-Men ally, runs onto the grounds.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #487''</ref>

Warpath enters the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] Tunnels along with Hepzibah, Storm, and Caliban.

Warpath's name has been written on a Morlock wall, along with the names of the other X-Men team members.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #488''</ref>

After the Morlock encounter, Hepzibah speaks with Scott, who accepts her having Warpath as her new mate and they begin a relationship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #491''</ref>

Later when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks the mansion looking for Professor Xavier, Warpath is one of the X-Men who answers the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]' call for help.<ref>''World War Hulk : X-Men #2''</ref>

===Messiah Complex===

==Powers and abilities==
Warpath is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses superhuman physical ability in virtually all areas:

He possesses superhuman strength (used as his main power in X-Force, as the team 'strong guy') with his current power levels showing him capable of toppling a Sentinel by clapping, the resulting air pressure causing it to collapse.  He has even directly fought with and managed to hold his own against the Juggernaut.<ref>''X-Force' vol.1 #3</ref>

He possesses superhuman resistance to injury, at least enough to withstand short-range firepower,<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #115</ref> grenade explosions,<ref>''Deadpool'' vol.1 #11</ref> and even a direct telekinetic attack<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #25</ref> from a Alpha-level mutant psionic such as Exodus.  He also repairs and regenerates damaged and destroyed tissue much faster than a normal human, as well as revives and recuperates from exhaustion and fatigue much faster than a normal human.

He possesses superhuman agility & flexibility, as he has been officially stated to "move with the grace an Olympic gold-medalist would envy"<ref>''X-Force'' vol.1 #65</ref> and "swim with the ease of a porpoise."<ref>''X-Force'' vol.1 #81</ref>

His power of flight was discovered by his one-time mentor and team leader [[Peter Wisdom]], who analyzed his mutation after the High Evolutionary devolved and re-evolved all mutants on Earth, and forced James to incorporate this ability in his fighting style.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #104</ref> This power has not been depicted in later comic storylines, although writer [[Ed Brubaker]] has said that he chose not to depict Warpath's flight power because he didn't understand how Warpath's speed and strength would allow it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, his fighting style in the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' storyline has shown him to return to using his flight powers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #493''</ref> In ''X-Force'' he can be seen flying even for long distances.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} It has since been suggested by writer [[Christopher Yost]] that "I thought he was a little embarrassed by the whole flying thing".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Warpath's senses, particularly sight, smell and hearing, are enhanced to levels beyond the capabilities of a normal human. He is able to see with perfect clarity at much greater distances than an ordinary human. He retains this same level of visual clarity, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is similarly heightened, enabling him to both clearly hear sounds that ordinary humans can't and sounds that they can detect but at much greater distances.

After nearly getting killed by [[Reignfire]], Warpath experienced an increase in senses and speed that allowed him to perform feats he had previously not been aware he was capable of, such as run at high speeds up to at least 150&nbsp;km/h (roughly 93&nbsp;mph) for long distances and quickly climb building walls by rapidly digging his hands and feet into the bare concrete.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #51</ref> He can even evade weapon fire with rapid reflexes and reactions.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #94</ref>

Aside from his natural physical attributes, Warpath is well versed in hand-to-hand combat, which is enhanced by his superhuman reflex/reaction rate and eye/ear-hand/foot coordination. He was trained in unarmed combat under the guidance of [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] and was personally extensively trained in the use of the staff by his long-time teammate star Mojoverse gladiator [[Shatterstar]] - who he eventually matched in a record time of only a dozen tries<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #52</ref> - at the insistence of their mentor [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].  He currently wields a pair of [[Bowie knife|bowie knives]] composed of [[vibranium]], given to him by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], with which he has proved to be highly proficient in combat.  James is also a skilled hunter and tracker in his native Apache tradition.

Ghost Rider activated limited Apache shaman abilities within James, in order to help him fight the Demon Bear. He could perceive the creature's wounds and the resulting spirit energy when it was destroyed.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #10</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Warpath made a cameo in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "[[List of X-Men episodes|Slave Island]]" as one of the mutant slaves. He also appears as a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] team in the opening credits.
