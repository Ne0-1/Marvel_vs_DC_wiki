'''Warpath''' is a [[mutant]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], best known as a member of the [[X-Men]] offshoot [[X-Force]]. Warpath (real name James Proudstar) is an [[Apache]] [[Native American]] who possesses [[superhuman]] levels of strength and endurance, reflected by his hulking physique. He is the younger brother of the shortly-lived X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], who possessed similiar powers. When James first appeared he used the codename Thunderbird as well but is best known as Warpath today.

===History===
James' brother John Proudstar was one of the "All New, All Different" X-Men who debuted in ''Giant-Sized X-Men'' #1 ([[1975]]). He was killed on a mission, months after. James blamed the X-Men for his brother's death and made it his life’s mission to murder the its founder [[Professor X]].

James first appeared, under the name Thunderbird, in issue #16 ([[June 1984]]) of ''[[The New Mutants]]'', a series featuring a junior X-Men team. Then, James was a member of the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]], a team of young mutants led by the supervillain [[The White Queen]].

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 ([[May 1985]]), which celebrated the tenth anniversary of the X-Men’s revival, James reappeared, donning his brother’s costume, and kidnapped the X-Men’s [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]] where John was killed. However, when the oppurtunity arrived, James was unable to kill Professor X in cold blood. 

Months later, James found his entire tribe murdered and thought the Hellions committed the act to punish him for leaving the team. He then joined The New Mutants, now under the tutelage of the mysterious war hawk [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], hoping to track down the Hellions. 

In [[1991]], The New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and became the militant X-Force and James changed his codename to Warpath. Warpath was a part of X-Force for all of its ten year existence. As a member of X-Force, James became more calm and controlled and was romantically involved with his teammate [[Siryn]] (ironically Banshee’s daughter). He also discovered that X-Force’s adversary [[Stryfe]] was behind the killing of his tribe but Stryfe was already dead by the time Warpath learned so. When the former British intelligence agent [[Pete Wisdom]] became X-Force's mentor, in [[2000]], he helped James learn how to use his powers to fly.

After X-Force’s disintegration, Warpath joined the [[Mumbai]] branch of the international mutant agency [[X-Corporation]].
