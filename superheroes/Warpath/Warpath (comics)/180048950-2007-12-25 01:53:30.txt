'''Warpath''' ('''James Proudstar'''), previously known as the second '''Thunderbird,''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #16 ([[1984#June|June 1984]]).

An [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Proudstar possesses [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] superhuman strength and speed, like his older brother, the short-lived X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], though Warpath's power-levels are much higher. 

He originally blamed the X-Men for his brotherâ€™s death and joined the [[supervillain|villain]] group the [[Hellions]] to get revenge. He later reconsidered his views and became a longtime member of the militant X-Men offshoot [[X-Force]]. He is currently a member of the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' team.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
James Proudstar was born at the [[Indian reservation|Apache reservation]] at [[Camp Verde, Arizona]].  James' brother, [[John Proudstar]], was one of the "All New, All Different" X-Men who debuted in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975). He was killed on one of the team's earliest missions. James angrily blamed the X-Men for his brother's death and made it his life's mission to murder its founder, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]. 
===Taking retribution===
In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985), which celebrated the tenth anniversary of the X-Men's revival, James reappeared, donning his brother's costume, and kidnapped the X-Men's [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]] where John was killed. However, when the opportunity arrived, James was unable to kill Professor X in cold blood. Professor X offered membership into the New Mutants to James, but he declined. Instead, James became a member of the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]], a team of young mutants led by the supervillain [[Emma Frost|The White Queen]].

===A quiet life interrupted===
Months later, James came to realize that the [[Massachusetts]] Academy wasn't the place for him. So, he left to return home to his family's [[Indian reservation|reservation]], in [[Camp Verde, Arizona]]. James enjoyed his stay at home so much, that he originally turned down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s offer to join the New Mutants. After the meeting, in [[New York]], James returned home, to find his entire tribe murdered. James originally thought that the Hellions committed the act to punish him for leaving the team, due to a [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] foot soldier's mask he found alongside the bodies of his fallen tribesmen. He then joined the New Mutants, hoping to track down the Hellions and gain revenge.

===X-Force===
Before long, the New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and became the militant [[X-Force]] and James changed his codename to Warpath. Warpath was a part of X-Force for the duration of the team. As a member of X-Force, James became more calm and controlled and struck up a close friendship with his teammate [[Siryn]] (ironically Banshee's daughter). Despite his strong attraction to her, Theresa only saw James as a friend.

===Coming to terms with life===
James finally had a face to face with Emma Frost. The two talked about the deaths of his tribesmen, but Emma swore she wasn't involved. Warpath eventually met a woman, by the name of [[Risque (comics)|Risque]]. Risque was instrumental in helping James with his confidence and the two began a love affair.  Unfortunately, Risque was being blackmailed by a man named Sledge, who forced her to drug Warpath and bring him to his lair.  Sledge gave him information about a member of the tribe that was still alive, but in turn James had to retrieve his partner, the [[Vanisher]] who had disappeared in another dimension.  James found the Vanisher and in turn Sledge game information on one of his tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, whom James had presumed deceased.  Whitecloud told him that [[Stryfe]], X-Force's adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James went to [[Hell]] to gain revenge, but was returned back to the living world by [[Blackheart]].  When James found out Risque's involvement in the whole ordeal, he ended their relationship despite her deepest remorse.  She would eventually reunite with X-Force on several occasions as an ally.

James returned to X-Force and stayed a devoted member. When the former British intelligence agent [[Pete Wisdom]] became X-Force's mentor, he helped James learn how to use his powers to fly. James was presumed dead in a violent altercation, along with most of his team-mates.

===X-Corporation===
After X-Force's disintegration, Warpath joined the [[Mumbai]] branch of the international mutant agency, [[X-Corporation]], in [[India]]. His new team was a mix of old and new friends. [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], Sunfire and [[Thornn (comics)|Thornn]]. He stayed there with the X-Corporation for a while, helping to save Professor Xaiver's life, who was surprised that he was still alive. Later he rejoined X-Force at Cable's request. X-Force has since disbanded, with Cannonball, Cable and Warpath joining separate teams of X-Men. Rictor and Siryn have joined [[X-Factor Investigations]], and Boom Boom is in the superhero group [[Nextwave]] after a brief stint as part of Cable's [[Underground (comics)|Underground]].

===The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire===
Warpath was one of the few mutants to retain their powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], and soon after found himself living in the Mutant camp at X-Men's mansion.  Shortly afterwards, he joined the ranks of the X-Men for the first time (''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #475), at [[Professor X]]'s request. Along with [[Professor X]], [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], he journeys into space to track down [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. He shows his superb fighting prowess while fighting cyborg drones as the X-Men attempt to commandeer a [[Shi'ar]] ship.  During the final fight with Vulcan (''Uncanny X-Men #486'') Warpath fought bravely and in the end was on the spaceship with half of the team when Lilandra sent it back to Earth.

===Back on Earth===
Warpath, since has been shown training with [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]]. When training the two hear a loud bang and rush to the scene to find a Sentinel attacking someone. Warpath hits the Sentinel, then checks on the victim which turns out to be Caliban. Nightcrawler shows up and teleports Caliban away to the infirmary and Warpath continues to threaten the Sentinel until Storm shows up telling the Sentinel that Caliban is under the protection of The X-Men. 

Warpath, Storm, Hepzibah and Caliban enter the Morlock Tunnels looking for them. While walking around the tunnels, Warpath stops the team and tells them he smells alligators. Caliban explains that they were their protectors and a girl could talk to them, but Warpath tells him that she's gone and they aren't listening anymore. Later James is shown fighting with one of the alligators. While fighting its tail crashes through a wall and Warpath defeats it. The team walk through the hole in the wall and find where Leech was taken and then find writing on the wall which is what Masque is going on about.

===World War Hulk===
Warpath is one of the X-Men who answers The [[Stepford Cuckoo]]'s call for help when Hulk attacks Professor Xavier. 

===Messiah Complex===
Warpath will rejoin X-Force. While the X-Force is searching a Cooperstown Hospital to pick up the trail of the fugitive Cable. Wolverine doesn't trust that Warpath will be willing to kill Cable should the need arise, and he asks Wolfsbane to keep an eye on him, but she learns that while he won't like it, he'll do what needs to be done. As the X-Force finishes dispatching the remaining Reavers,[[Caliban]] sacrifices himself to save Warpath by jumping into the path of a line of bullets meant for him.

==Powers and abilities==

Warpath is a mutant who possesses superhuman strength (used as his main power in X-Force, as the team 'strong guy'; he was paired with the likes of Strong Guy and the Juggernaut in battles), speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and a high degree of resistance to physical injury.  He has previously demonstrated the ability of flight (most likely a temporary secondary mutation), although this power has not been depicted in recent comic storylines. Writer [[Ed Brubaker]] has said that he chose not to depict Warpath's flight power because he didn't understand how Warpath's speed and strength would allow it.

He also possesses heightened senses which enable him, among other things, to see in near-total darkness and hear whispers from great distances. After nearly getting killed by [[Reignfire]], Warpath experienced an increase in senses and speed that allowed him to perform feats he had previously not been aware he was capable of, such as run at high speeds for long distances and quickly climb building walls by rapidly digging his hands and feet into the bare concrete.

Aside from his natural physical attributes, Warpath is well versed in hand-to-hand combat. He has been trained in the use of the bo staff as a weapon in battle at the insistence of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. He currently wields [[Bowie knife|bowie knives]] composed of [[vibranium]], given to him by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], which he is highly experienced and skilled with.
