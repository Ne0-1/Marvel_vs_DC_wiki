'''Warpath''' ('''James Proudstar''') is a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[Superhero|superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], best known as a member of [[X-Force]], an offshoot of the [[X-Men]]. Warpath is an [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], who is the younger brother of the shortly-lived X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. James first appeared with the codename '''Thunderbird''', in ''[[New Mutants]]'' Vol. 1 #16 (June 1984). He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Character history==
===Origin===
James' brother, John Proudstar, was one of the "All New, All Different" X-Men who debuted in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975). He was killed on one of team's earliest missions. James angrily blamed the X-Men for his brother's death and made it his life's mission to murder its founder, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]. James became a member of the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]], a team of young mutants led by the supervillain [[Emma Frost|The White Queen]]. 

===Taking retribution===
In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985), which celebrated the tenth anniversary of the X-Men's revival, James reappeared, donning his brother's costume, and kidnapped the X-Men's [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]] where John was killed. However, when the opportunity arrived, James was unable to kill Professor X in cold blood. Professor X offered membership into the New Mutants to James, but he declined. Instead, James rejoined the Hellions.

===A quiet life interrupted===
Months later, James came to realize that the [[Massachusetts]] Academy wasn't the place for him. So, he left to return home to his family's [[Indian reservation|reservation]], in [[Camp Verde, Arizona]]. James enjoyed his stay at home so much, that he originally turned down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s offer to join the New Mutants. After the meeting, in [[New York]], James returned home, to find his entire tribe murdered. James originally thought that the Hellions committed the act to punish him for leaving the team. He then joined the New Mutants, hoping to track down the Hellions and gain revenge. 

===X-Force===
Before long, the New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and became the militant [[X-Force]] and James changed his codename to Warpath. Warpath was a part of X-Force, for all of its existence. As a member of X-Force, James became more calm and controlled and was romantically involved with his teammate [[Siryn]] (ironically Banshee's daughter). 

====Coming to terms with life====
James finally had a face to face, with Emma Frost. The two talked about the deaths of his tribesmen, but Emma swore she wasn't involved. Warpath eventually met a woman, by the name of Risque. Risque was instrumental in helping James with his confidence. She introduced him to a man called Sledge. Sledge gave him information about a a member of the tribe that was still alive. James found this tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, who told him that [[Stryfe]], X-Force's adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James went to [[Hell]] to gain revenge, but was returned back to the living world by [[Blackheart]].

James returned to X-Force and stayed a devoted member. When the former British intelligence agent [[Pete Wisdom]] became X-Force's mentor, he helped James learn how to use his powers to fly.

===Recently===
After X-Force's disintegration, Warpath joined the [[Mumbai]] branch of the international mutant agency, [[X-Corporation]], in [[India]]. He stayed there with the X-Corporation for a while, before joining a reformed X-Force at Cable's request. 

==Powers and abilities==
Warpath mutant abilites gives him the [[superhuman]] levels of strength, speed, endurance, enhanced senses, and flight. All of which are reflected by his hulking physique.
