'''James Proudstar''', previously known as the second '''[[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]''' but also known as '''Warpath''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared as the second Thunderbird in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #16 ([[1984 in comics#June|June 1984]]).

An [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Proudstar possesses [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhuman strength and speed, like his older brother, the short-lived X-Men [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], though Warpath's power-levels are much higher.

He originally blamed the X-Men for his brother’s death and joined the [[supervillain|villain]] group the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] to get revenge. He later reconsidered his views and became a longtime member of the militant X-Men offshoot [[X-Force]]. After a long journey to the Shi'ar Empire with the [[Uncanny X-Men]], Warpath became a member of the new incarnation of X-Force but he left after the events of Necrosha.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared as the second Thunderbird in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #16 ([[1984 in comics#June|June 1984]]). The character initially appeared as an antagonist of the [[New Mutants]] and [[X-Men]], but eventually joined the New Mutants in issue #99 of that series, and the team became known as [[X-Force]] in the first issue of that series. The character appeared regularly as a member of that team for most of the duration of the title.

==Fictional character biography==
James Proudstar was born on the Apache reservation at [[Camp Verde, Arizona]]. James' brother, [[Thunderbird (comics)|John Proudstar]] of the [[X-Men]], is killed on one of the team's missions.<ref>''X-Men'' #95 (October 1975)</ref> James blames the X-Men's founder, [[Professor X]], for his brother's joining the X-Men.

James is recruited for [[Emma Frost]]'s [[Hellions]]. As a Hellion, James clashes with the [[New Mutants]] and [[Kitty Pryde]], but to his chagrin, Frost feels they are not ready to take on the adult X-Men.<ref>''New Mutants'' #16-17</ref> Impatient for revenge, James defies Frost's orders, dons his brother's costume, and kidnaps former X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]], where John was killed. However, when the opportunity to kill Professor X arrives, James finds he has too many doubts about how John joined the X-Men. James is reconciled with the X-Men, and Professor X offers him membership in the New Mutants, but he declines out of loyalty to his friends in the Hellions.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985)</ref> 

Months later, James leaves the Hellions and returns home to his family's [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] makes him another offer to join the New Mutants, but he turns Cable down. After a meeting in [[New York]], James returns home to find his entire tribe murdered. James deduces that the Hellions committed the act to punish him for leaving the team. He joins the New Mutants, hoping to track down the Hellions and gain revenge.<ref>''New Mutants'' #99</ref> The New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and become the militant adventurers [[X-Force]], and James changes his codename to Warpath.

Sledge's partner, the [[Vanisher]], has disappeared in another dimension. Sledge hints at abilities within James that make him adept at surviving in this alternate dimension, but does not explain what these abilities are.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}  James finds the Vanisher, and in turn Sledge gives information on one of his tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, whom James had presumed deceased.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Whitecloud tells him that [[Stryfe]], X-Force's adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James goes to [[Hell]] to gain revenge, but is returned to the living world by [[Blackheart]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} When James finds out Risque's involvement, he ends their relationship.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

After X-Force's disintegration, Warpath joins the [[Mumbai]] branch of the international mutant agency, [[X-Corporation]].

He stays there for a while, helping to save Professor X's life.<ref>''New X-Men'' #133 (December 2002)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove|section=y|date=January 2013}}

Warpath is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses superhuman physical ability in virtually all areas:

He possesses superhuman strength. The air pressure from one of his claps causes a Sentinel to collapse.{{cn|date=September 2013}} He has even directly fought with and managed to hold his own against the Juggernaut.<ref>''X-Force'' #3</ref>

He possesses superhuman resistance to injury, at least enough to withstand short-range firepower,<ref>''X-Force'' #115</ref> grenade explosions,<ref>''Deadpool'' #11</ref> and even a direct telekinetic attack from Exodus.<ref>''X-Force'' vol 1. #25 (August 1993)</ref> He also repairs and regenerates damaged and destroyed tissue much faster than a normal human, as well as revives and recuperates from exhaustion and fatigue much faster than a normal human.

He possesses superhuman agility and flexibility, as he has been stated to "move with the grace an Olympic gold-medalist would envy"<ref>''X-Force'' #65</ref> and "swim with the ease of a porpoise."<ref>''X-Force'' #81</ref>

His power of flight was discovered by his one-time mentor and team leader [[Peter Wisdom]], who analyzed his mutation after the High Evolutionary devolved and re-evolved all mutants on Earth, and forced James to incorporate this ability in his fighting style.<ref>''X-Force'' #104</ref> This power has not been depicted in later comic storylines, although writer [[Ed Brubaker]] has said that he chose not to depict Warpath's flight power because he didn't understand how Warpath's speed and strength would allow it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, his fighting style in the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' storyline has shown him to return to using his flight powers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #493</ref> In ''X-Force'' he can be seen flying even for long distances.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} It has since been suggested by writer [[Christopher Yost]] that "I thought he was a little embarrassed by the whole flying thing".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Warpath's senses, particularly sight, smell and hearing, are enhanced to levels beyond the capabilities of a normal human. He is able to see with perfect clarity at much greater distances than an ordinary human. He retains this same level of visual clarity, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is similarly heightened, enabling him to both clearly hear sounds that ordinary humans can't and sounds that they can detect but at much greater distances.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

After nearly getting killed by [[Reignfire]],{{issue|date=September 2013}} Warpath experienced an increase in senses and speed that allowed him to perform feats he had previously not been aware he was capable of, such as run at high speeds up to at least 150&nbsp;km/h (roughly 93&nbsp;mph) for long distances and quickly climb building walls by rapidly digging his hands and feet into the bare concrete.<ref>''X-Force'' #51</ref> He can even evade weapon fire with rapid reflexes and reactions.<ref>''X-Force'' #94</ref>

Aside from his natural physical attributes, Warpath is well versed in hand-to-hand combat, which is enhanced by his superhuman reflex/reaction rate and eye/ear-hand/foot coordination. He was trained in unarmed combat under the guidance of [[Emma Frost]] and was extensively trained in the use of the staff by his long-time teammate [[Shatterstar]] - who he eventually matched in a record time of only a dozen tries.<ref>''X-Force'' #52</ref> He wields a pair of [[Bowie knife|bowie knives]] composed of [[vibranium]], given to him by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]],{{issue|date=September 2013}} with which he has proved to be highly proficient in combat. James is also a skilled hunter and tracker in his native Apache tradition.

Ghost Rider activated limited Apache shaman abilities within James, in order to help him fight the Demon Bear. He could perceive the creature's wounds and the resulting spirit energy when it was destroyed.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #10</ref>
