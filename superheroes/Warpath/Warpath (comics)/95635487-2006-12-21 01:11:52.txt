'''Warpath''' ('''James Proudstar'''), previously known as the second '''Thunderbird,''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #16 ([[1984#June|June 1984]]).

An [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Proudstar possesses [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] superhuman strength and speed, like his older brother, the short-lived X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], though Warpath's power-levels are much higher. 

He originally blamed the X-Men for his brotherâ€™s death and joined the [[supervillain|villain]] group the [[Hellions]] to get revenge. He later reconsidered his views and became a longtime member of the militant X-Men offshoot [[X-Force]]. He is currently a member of the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' team.

==Character history==
===Origin===
James' brother, John Proudstar, was one of the "All New, All Different" X-Men who debuted in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975). He was killed on one of the team's earliest missions. James angrily blamed the X-Men for his brother's death and made it his life's mission to murder its founder, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]. James became a member of the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]], a team of young mutants led by the supervillain [[Emma Frost|The White Queen]].

===Taking retribution===
In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985), which celebrated the tenth anniversary of the X-Men's revival, James reappeared, donning his brother's costume, and kidnapped the X-Men's [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]] where John was killed. However, when the opportunity arrived, James was unable to kill Professor X in cold blood. Professor X offered membership into the New Mutants to James, but he declined. Instead, James rejoined the Hellions.

===A quiet life interrupted===
Months later, James came to realize that the [[Massachusetts]] Academy wasn't the place for him. So, he left to return home to his family's [[Indian reservation|reservation]], in [[Camp Verde, Arizona]]. James enjoyed his stay at home so much, that he originally turned down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s offer to join the New Mutants. After the meeting, in [[New York]], James returned home, to find his entire tribe murdered. James originally thought that the Hellions committed the act to punish him for leaving the team, due to a [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] foot soldier's mask he found alongside the bodies of his fallen tribesmen. He then joined the New Mutants, hoping to track down the Hellions and gain revenge.

===X-Force===
Before long, the New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and became the militant [[X-Force]] and James changed his codename to Warpath. Warpath was a part of X-Force, for all of its existence. As a member of X-Force, James became more calm and controlled and struck up a close friendship with his teammate [[Siryn]] (ironically Banshee's daughter). Despite his strong attraction to her, Theresa only saw James as a friend.

===Coming to terms with life===

James finally had a face to face with Emma Frost. The two talked about the deaths of his tribesmen, but Emma swore she wasn't involved. Warpath eventually met a woman, by the name of [[Risque (comics)|Risque]]. Risque was instrumental in helping James with his confidence. She introduced him to a man called Sledge. Sledge gave him information about a member of the tribe that was still alive. James found this tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, who told him that [[Stryfe]], X-Force's adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James went to [[Hell]] to gain revenge, but was returned back to the living world by [[Blackheart]].

James returned to X-Force and stayed a devoted member. When the former British intelligence agent [[Pete Wisdom]] became X-Force's mentor, he helped James learn how to use his powers to fly.

After X-Force's disintegration, Warpath joined the [[Mumbai]] branch of the international mutant agency, [[X-Corporation]], in [[India]]. He stayed there with the X-Corporation for a while, before rejoining X-Force at Cable's request. X-Force has since disbanded, with Cannonball, Cable and Warpath joining separate teams of X-Men. Rictor and Siryn have joined [[X-Factor Investigations]], and Boom Boom is in the superhero group [[Nextwave]]. 

Warpath was one of the few mutants to retain their powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], and soon after found himself living in the Mutant camp at X-Men's mansion.  Shortly afterwards, he joined the ranks of the X-Men for the first time (''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #475), at [[Professor X]]'s request.  Along with [[Professor X]], [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Havok]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], he journeys into space to track down [[Vulcan (comics)|Vulcan]].  He shows his superb fighting prowess while fighting cyborg drones as the X-Men attempt to commandeer a [[Shi'ar]] ship.

==Powers and abilities==
Warpath is a mutant who possesses superhuman strength, speed, flight, stamina, agility, reflexes, and a high degree of resistance to physical injury.

Aside from his physical attributes, Warpath is well versed in hand to hand combat. He is usually wields knives composed of [[vibranium]], which he is capable of using with great expertise.
