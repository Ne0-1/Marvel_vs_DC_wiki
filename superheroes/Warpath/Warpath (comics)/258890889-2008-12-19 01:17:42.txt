'''James Proudstar''', previously known as the second '''Thunderbird''' but also known as '''Warpath''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #16 ([[1984#June|June 1984]]).

An [[Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Proudstar possesses [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhuman strength and speed, like his older brother, the short-lived X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], though Warpath's power-levels are much higher. 

He originally blamed the X-Men for his brotherâ€™s death and joined the [[supervillain|villain]] group the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] to get revenge. He later reconsidered his views and became a longtime member of the militant X-Men offshoot [[X-Force]].  After a long journey to the Shi'ar Empire with the [[Uncanny X-Men]], Warpath is now a member of the new incarnation of X-Force.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
James Proudstar was born on the Apache reservation at [[Camp Verde, Arizona]].  James' brother, [[Thunderbird (comics)|John Proudstar]], was one of the "All New, All Different" X-Men<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975)</ref>. He was killed on one of the team's earliest missions. James angrily blamed the X-Men for his brother's death and made it his life's mission to murder its founder, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]].

===Taking retribution===
James hatred of the X-Men made him an ideal recruit for Emma Frost's Hellions.  A team intended to be her answer to Charles Xavier's New Mutants.  As a Hellion, James clashed with the New Mutants and Shadowcat.  But his hatred led him to attack the X-Men on his own, with the unexpected, and unwanted, aid of Roulette, Empath and Firestar.
James donned his brother's costume, and kidnapped the X-Men's [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]] where John was killed<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985)</ref>. However, when the opportunity arrived, James was unable to kill Professor X in cold blood. Professor X offered membership into the New Mutants to James, but he declined.

===A quiet life interrupted===
Months later, James came to realize that the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] wasn't the place for him. So, he left to return home to his family's [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. James enjoyed his stay at home so much, that he originally turned down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s offer to join the [[New Mutants]]. After the meeting, in [[New York]], James returned home, to find his entire tribe murdered. James originally thought that the Hellions committed the act to punish him for leaving the team, due to a foot soldier's mask he found alongside the bodies of his fallen tribesmen. He then joined the New Mutants, hoping to track down the Hellions and gain revenge.

===X-Force===
Before long, the New Mutants cut ties with the X-Men and became the militant [[X-Force]] and James changed his codename to Warpath. Warpath was a part of X-Force for the duration of the team. As a member of X-Force, James became more calm and controlled and struck up a close friendship with his teammate [[Siryn]] (ironically Banshee's daughter). Despite his strong attraction to her, Theresa only saw James as a friend.

===Coming to terms with life===
James finally had a face to face with Emma Frost. The two talked about the deaths of his tribesmen, but Emma swore she wasn't involved. Warpath eventually met a woman, by the name of [[Risque (comics)|Risque]]. Risque was instrumental in helping James with his confidence and the two began a love affair.  Unfortunately, Risque was being blackmailed by a man named Sledge, who forced her to drug Warpath and bring him to his lair.  Sledge gave him information about a member of the tribe that was still alive, but in turn James had to retrieve his partner, the [[Vanisher]], who had disappeared in another dimension.  James found the Vanisher and in turn Sledge gave information on one of his tribesman, Michael Whitecloud, whom James had presumed deceased.  Whitecloud told him that [[Stryfe]], X-Force's adversary, was behind the killing of his tribe. James went to [[Hell]] to gain revenge, but was returned back to the living world by [[Blackheart]].  When James found out Risque's involvement in the whole ordeal, he ended their relationship despite her deepest remorse.  She would eventually reunite with X-Force on several occasions as an ally.

James returned to X-Force and stayed a devoted member. When the former British intelligence agent [[Pete Wisdom]] became X-Force's mentor, he helped James learn how to use his powers to fly. James was presumed dead in a violent altercation, along with most of his teammates.

===X-Corporation===
After X-Force's disintegration, Warpath joined the [[Mumbai]] branch of the international mutant agency, [[X-Corporation]], in [[India]]. His new team was a mix of old and new friends: [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], and [[Thornn]]. He stayed there with the X-Corporation for a while, helping to save Professor X's life, who was surprised that he was still alive. Later, he rejoined X-Force at Cable's request. X-Force has since disbanded, with [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], Cable, and Warpath joining separate teams of X-Men. [[Rictor]] and Siryn have joined [[X-Factor Investigations]], and [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]] is in the superhero group [[Nextwave]] after a brief stint as part of Cable's [[Underground (comics)|Underground]].

===X-Men===
Warpath was one of the few mutants to retain their powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], and soon after found himself living in the Mutant camp at X-Men's mansion.  Shortly afterwards, he joined the ranks of the X-Men for the first time at [[Professor X]]'s request.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #475</ref> Along with [[Professor X]], [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], he journeys into space to track down [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. He shows his superb fighting prowess while fighting cyborg drones as the X-Men attempt to commandeer a [[Shi'ar]] ship.  During the final fight with Vulcan<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #486''</ref>, Warpath fought bravely and in the end was on the spaceship with half of the team when [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] sent it back to Earth.

Since she is stuck on Earth and has nowhere else to go, Hepzibah joins Professor X's team of X-Men. She and Warpath have already created a bond of sorts, with Hepzibah remarking that his presence has helped her through her mourning of Corsair. Together, they confront one of the X-Mansion's guardian Sentinels when Caliban, a long time X-Men ally, runs onto the grounds.

Warpath enters the Morlock Tunnels along with Hepzibah, Storm, and Caliban. As a group, they are attempting to discover the reason for the Morlocks' increased activity, which has included the capturing of X-Men ward Leech. Warpaths name has been written on a Morlock wall, along with the names of the other X-Men team members.

After the Morlock encounter, [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]] speaks with Scott, who accepts her having Warpath as her new mate and they begin a relationship.

Later when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks the mansion looking for Professor Xavier, Warpath is one of the X-Men who answers The [[Stepford Cuckoos]]' call for help.

===Messiah Complex===
Warpath rejoins X-Force as they search a Cooperstown Hospital to pick up the trail of the fugitive Cable. Wolverine doesn't trust that Warpath will be willing to kill Cable should the need arise, and he asks Wolfsbane to keep an eye on him.  She learns that while he won't like it, he'll do what needs to be done. As the X-Force finishes dispatching the remaining Reavers, [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] sacrifices himself to save Warpath by jumping into the path of a line of bullets meant for him. In the final battle, Warpath and the rest of the X-Force team are charged with taking down Predator X.  James jumps on top of Predator X, stabbing it in the back.  However, he realizes that Predator X has a healing factor. He is later seen standing around Professor Xavier when he is thought dead.

===Divided We Stand===
[[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] goes to [[San Francisco, California]], to meet up with Hepzibah, Warpath and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. All four are caught in the effects of a city-wide illusion created by [[Martinique Jason]], who thanks to her powers has transformed the city into a [[hippie]] paradise.  Now calling himself "Running Sun", he and the others are sent by Jason to confront Cyclops and Emma Frost.  After Emma manages to break through Jason's illusion, Warpath and the other are returned to normal, after which they begin to re-establish the X-Men organization in San Francisco.

===X-Force===
Warpath is one of the founding members of the revived X-Force, Cyclops's covert wetworks team, charged with finding and eliminating Purifiers cells. James joins out of a desire for revenge for the death of his friend Caliban at the hands of the Purifiers. While physically the strongest member, he has shown to be shocked at the amount of blood shed on his and his teammates hands.

Since the team was not allowed to contact anyone from the outside world, he is shown regret being with the team then being with his girlfriend, Hepzibah.  James takes a break from duty, in order to make peace with the deaths he has caused and travels to visit the grave of his brother, John. En route, his truck is destroyed and James crawls from the wreckage to confront the attacker; the Demon Bear. After a fight with the Demon Bear, he realises he can't hurt the Bear and is badly beaten before being rescued by Ghost Rider. When he comes to, Ghost Rider says he is going to teach him how to kill a demon.

==Powers and abilities==
Warpath is a mutant who possesses superhuman senses, strength (used as his main power in X-Force, as the team 'strong guy'; he was paired with the likes of Strong Guy in battles), speed, agility, reflexes, endurance, and flight. His current strength levels have shown him capable of toppling a Sentinel by clapping, the resulting air pressure causing it to collapse.

His power of flight was discovered by his one-time mentor and team leader [[Peter Wisdom]], who analyzed his mutation after the High Evolutionary devolved and re-evolved all mutants on Earth, and forced James to incorporate this ability in his fighting style. This power has not been depicted in recent comic story-lines though, as current head X-Writer [[Ed Brubaker]] has said that he chose not to depict Warpath's flight power because he didn't understand how Warpath's speed and strength would allow it. However, his recent fighting style in the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex]] storyline has shown him to either return to using his flight powers, as the only alternative explanation is that he has gained a new ability to make extremely large leaps.

His super senses enable him to see in near-total darkness and hear whispers from great distances. 

After nearly getting killed by [[Reignfire]], Warpath experienced an increase in senses and speed that allowed him to perform feats he had previously not been aware he was capable of, such as run at high speeds for long distances and quickly climb building walls by rapidly digging his hands and feet into the bare concrete.

Aside from his natural physical attributes, Warpath is well versed in hand-to-hand combat. He has trained in the use of the staff at the insistence of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and currently wields a pair of [[Bowie knife|bowie knives]] composed of [[vibranium]], given to him by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], with which he has proved to be highly proficient in combat.
