'''Dreadknight''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He had ties to [[Doctor Doom]], and has come into conflict with [[Iron Man]].

He was created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[George Tuska]] in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #102 (August, 1977). Given that the criminal [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]] died fighting Iron Man during the Silver Age of comics, Dreadknight was likely meant as a new/legacy version of the villain, a heroic Black Knight having assumed the identity years before.

==Fictional character biography==
Bram Velsing was born in Schonstadt, [[Latveria]]. He became a scientist and engineer in the employ of [[Doctor Doom]]. When Doom discovered Velsing harbored treacherous ideals, he permanently grafted a skull-like cybernetic helm to Velsing's head, scarring him. He sent the now-mutilated Velsing into the Balkan wilds to die.

Velsing did not die, however. He gained a variety of weapons and took possession of the flying mutant horse employed by the original, criminal [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]] while taken under the care of [[Victoria Frankenstein]] (Dr. Victor Frankenstein's great-granddaughter), who discovered him in the wilderness. She brought Velsing to Castle Frankenstein and nursed him back to health. Velsing, now calling himself the Dreadknight, attempted to force more resources from Frankenstein that he might take revenge upon Doom, and tried to steal her secret notebooks. He was defeated by the "visiting" [[Iron Man]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]], and Victoria's mutated charges, [[The Children]]. Left a comatose, wounded shell at the finale of the battle, Dreadknight was given over to the custody of kindly Victoria and the Children.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref>

Velsing was revived by the mystical villains [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] and [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]]. He escaped Frankenstein's care with his steed and personal weaponry. He menaced [[Captain Britain]], [[Victoria Bentley]], and [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]], but was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

Dreadknight's further schemes usually consisted of sporadic mercenary work meant to gather personal power or wealth to attempt a coup of Latveria. He also battled [[Spider-Man]] when he became entangled in Dreadknight's failed coup of Latveria following Doom's apparent death fighting the entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

Dreadknight has made few appearances in the Marvel Universe. It is worth mentioning that [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] once wore the Dreadknight's armor and weapons during an infiltration effort. The tone of the appearance was such that it made soft suggestion that Velsing had lost or abandoned his costumed arsenal/persona.

==Powers and abilities==
Dreadknight wears a steel alloy body armor that he designed, and his mask was micro-surgically attached to his face by Doctor Doom and cannot be removed. Dreadknight also designed his power-lance, which projects electromagnetic force beams, fires electrified steel cable bolas, and launches miniature "penetro-shell" explosive missiles. He also invented his carbon dioxide pistol, which fires concentrated nerve gas which can render unconscious or kill opponents.

Bram Velsing is a skilled scientist and engineer, with an advanced degree in engineering.

Dreadknight rides the "hellhorse", a mutated bat-winged flying horse that was genetically engineered by [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]] and Victoria Frankenstein.

==Other media==
===Television===
* In the 1994 ''[[Iron Man]]'' [[animated series]], Dreadknight (voiced by [[Neil Dickson]]) served as one of the minions of [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]]. He and [[Blacklash]] were rivals for the affections of [[Hypnotia]], the sole female member of the Mandarin's followers.
