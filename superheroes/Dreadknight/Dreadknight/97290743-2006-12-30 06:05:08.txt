'''Dreadknight''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He has ties to [[Doctor Doom]], and has come into conflict with [[Iron Man]]. He was created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[George Tuska]] in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #101 (August, 1977). Given that the criminal [[Black Knight (Marvel Comics)#Villainous Black Knight|Black Knight]] died fighting Iron Man during the Silver Age of comics, Dreadknight was likely meant as a new/legacy version of the villain, a heroic Black Knight having assumed the identity years before.

Bram Velsing was a [[Latverian]] scientist in the employ of Dr. Doom. When Doom discovered Velsing harbored treacherous ideals, he grafted a skull-like cybernetic helm to Velsing's head, scarring him. He sent the now-mutilated Velsing into the Balkan wilds to die.

Velsing did not die, however. He gained a variety of weapons and took possession of the flying mutant horse employed by the original, criminal [[Black Knight (Marvel Comics)#Villainous Black Knight|Black Knight]] while taken under the care of [[Victoria Frankenstein]], who discovered him in the wilderness. Velsing, now calling himself the Dreadknight, attempted to force more resources from Frankenstein that he might take revenge upon Doom. He was defeated by the "visiting" [[Iron Man]], [[Frankenstein (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]], and Victoria's mutant charges, [[The Children]]. Left a wounded shell at the finale of the battle, Dreadknight was given over to kindly Victoria's custody.

Velsing would escape Frankenstein's care with his steed and personal weaponry. Dreadknight's further schemes usually consisted of sporradic mercenary work meant to gather personal power or wealth to attempt a coup of Latveria. He has served the mystical villains [[Morgan Le Fay]] and her son [[Mordred]] in campaigns against Avenger Dane Whitman and battled [[Spider-Man]] when he became entangled in Dreadknight's failed coup of Latveria following Doom's apparent death fighting the entity [[Onslaught]].

Dreadknight has made few appearances in the Marvel Universe. It is worth mentioning that [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] once wore the Dreaknight's armor and weapons during an infiltration effort. The tone of the appearance was such that it made soft suggestion that Velsing had lost or abandoned his costumed arsenal/persona.

==In Other Media==
In the [[1994]] ''[[Iron Man]]'' [[animated series]], Dreadknight served as one of the minions of [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]]. He and [[Blacklash]] were rivals for the affections of Hypnotia, the sole female member of the Mandarin's followers. He was played by [[Neil Dickson]].
