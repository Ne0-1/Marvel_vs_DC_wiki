'''Dreadknight''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=August 2015}}
The character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #101 (Aug. 1977) and was created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[George Tuska]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Bram Velsing''' is a [[Latveria]]n scientist, unsatisfied with serving [[Doctor Doom]] whom he referred to as a "grotesque mockery" and thought himself as his superior. Upon learning of Velsing's treacherous ideals, Doom permanently grafts a skull-like cybernetic helmet to Velsing's head, scarring him. Velsing flees, and comes under the care of Victoria Frankenstein who nurses him back to health at Castle Frankenstein. The character gains a variety of weapons and rides the "Hellhorse", a mutated bat-winged flying horse genetically engineered from [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]'s flying horse by Victoria Frankenstein. Calling himself the Dreadknight, the character attempts to force more resources from Frankenstein to defeat Doctor Doom but is defeated by [[Iron Man]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]], and Victoria's mutated charges The Children.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref>

Velsing is revived by the mystical villains [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] and [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], and menaced [[Captain Britain]], [[Victoria Bentley]], and [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]] but is defeated by [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] impersonated Dreadknight in order to get close to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #20</ref>

Following Doctor Doom's apparent death at the hands of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Dreadknight briefly takes over Latveria and battles [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited #16''</ref>

Dreadknight later appeared fighting [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and apparently still serving (but resenting) [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Iron Man: Legacy'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dreadknight wears a steel alloy body armor granting him superhuman strength and durability. The character uses a power-lance capable of projecting energy blasts; electrified steel cable bolas; miniature missiles; and also uses a carbon dioxide pistol that fires concentrated nerve gas which can render unconscious or kill opponents. Dreadknight rides the "Hellhorse", a mutated bat-winged flying horse that was genetically engineered by Victoria Frankenstein from the winged horse that was used by Nathan Garrett.

Bram Velsing is also a gifted scientist with skills as an engineer.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' universe, Bram Velsing appears in a suit of armor based on [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Ultimate Iron Man]]'s designs in the 2009 ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' series. Although his armor features a skull motif and is painted in a color scheme reminiscent of his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart, he is never called Dreadknight. The German-born Velsing made his home in a renovated Castle [[Frankenstein]] where he fought Iron Man with the help of Justine Hammer. At the end of their encounter, Iron Man locked down the defeated Velsing's armor leaving him to [[Asphyxia|suffocate]]. At one point during the battle, Velsing asks why a girl (in this case, the Ultimate version of [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]]) is in his presence "without a leash."<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #2-3</ref>

==In other media==
