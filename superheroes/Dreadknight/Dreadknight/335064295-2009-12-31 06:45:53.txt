==Biography==
'''Bram Velsing''' is a [[Latveria]]n scientist, unsatisfied with serving [[Doctor Doom]] whom he refered to as a "grotesque mockery" and thought himself as his superior. Upon learning of Velsing's treacherous ideals, Doom permanently grafts a skull-like cybernetic helmet to Velsing's head, scarring him. Velsing flees, and comes under the care of [[Victoria Frankenstein]] who nurses him back to health at Castle Frankenstein. The character gains a variety of weapons and rides the "hellhorse", a mutated bat-winged flying horse genetically engineered by [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]. Calling himself the Dreadknight, the character attempts to force more resources from Frankenstein to defeat  Doom but is defeated by [[Iron Man]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]], and Victoria's mutated charges, [[The Children]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref> Velsing is revived by the mystical villains [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] and [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], and menaced [[Captain Britain]], [[Victoria Bentley]], and [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]] but is defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]], [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref>''Black Knight'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> Following Doctor Doom's apparant death at the hands of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Dreadknight briefly takes Latveria and battles [[Spider-Man]]. <ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited #16''</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Dreadknight===
Bram Velsing appears in a suit of armor based on Tony Stark's designs to menace Ultimate Iron Man in the 2009 [[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]] series. Although his armor features a skull motif and is painted in a color scheme reminiscent of his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart, he is never called Dreadknight. Ultimate Velsing made his home in a renovated Castle [[Frankenstein]]. At the end of their encounter, Iron Man locked down the defeated Velsing's armor, leaving him to die, presumably of suffocation.{{issue}}
