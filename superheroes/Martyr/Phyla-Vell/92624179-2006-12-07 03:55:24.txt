'''Phyla-Vell''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She is the fourth to bear the name [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], her brother [[Genis-Vell]] being the third. She was created by [[Peter David]] and [[Paul Azaceta]] in ''Captain Marvel'' (6th series) #16 (December 2003). 

Her name is derived from the [[Scientific classification]] [[Phyla]], one of the levels of organization ([[taxon]]s) for classifying [[life]]. This is a reference to the fact that her brother Genis-Vell's name comes from [[Genus]], one of the other classifications for life forms.
  
The character is a [[retcon]] &mdash; her existence and history conflict with previous published stories and were retroactively established. This is resolved in ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 6) #18 (February, 2004), where it is explained that after Captain Marvel III (Genis-Vell) previously destroyed and recreated the universe the "new" version was subtly altered with her existence being one of the changes.

The same comic reveals that she is the second artificially created offspring of Captain Mar-Vell who was created by her mother [[Elysius]] in the "new" universe because her first attempt (Genis-Vell) had been so successful. 

She fights her (at the time insane) brother Genis-Vell in ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 6) #17-18 (January - February, 2004), in the process helping to restore his sanity. In #19 (March, 2004), she tries to lay claim to the "Captain Marvel" title, though her brother refuses to give it up.

The ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 6) series heavily hinted that Phyla-Vell is a [[lesbian]], and in #25 (September, 2004) the character admits that she is attracted to [[Moondragon]] and invites her on a tour of the "[[spiral nebula]] near Renault VII". Before Moondragon can accept the two wander through a portal. 

Phyla appeared at the trial of Starfox (She-Hulk #12-13, 2006).

Recently she appeared in the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' [[limited series]], she had been visiting her fathers grave with Moondragon when the pair were attacked by [[Thanos]] who ripped off Moondragon's ear and gave it to Phyla, telling her to go to [[Drax the Destroyer]] and how his actions would determine Moondragons's fate shortly before teleporting away with Moondragon. Drax has indicated he will not be stopping his pursuit of Thanos.
