'''Krakoa''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]], commonly associated with the [[X-Men]]. It is a living [[island]], a sentient [[ecosystem]] able to command all the living things native to its island body, and even its terrain. Its name was derived from the real [[Indonesia]]n [[volcano]] island [[Krakatoa]].

Although Krakoa has made only one notable appearance in the X-Men franchise, it is vividly remembered by the fanbase as the main enemy in what may be the most influential X-Men comic of all time, ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1. Krakoa is directly responsible for the formation of the "new" X-Men.

==Fictional character biography==
===''[[Giant-Size X-Men]] #1''===
Krakoa was originally a very small island in the Pacific Ocean that was located close to where some nuclear bombing tests were done. The radiation somehow turned the island's ecosystem into a hive-mind entity.

In ''Giant-Size X-Men #1'', the X-Men (then consisting of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl (Jean Grey)]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]) came to the island after [[Cerebro]] detected an unknown mutant there, and were captured by Krakoa, who used them as foodsources. Cyclops was the only one able to flee, but doesn't remember what happened. [[Professor X]] decides to recruit international mutants to save his X-Men, namely [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and sends them to Krakoa. 

Cyclops' group of mutants pair off and after each pair encounter and defeat various aspects of the island, the new X-Men team finds the original X-Men, who are weakened from being fed upon by Krakoa for so long. At this point, it is revealed that the island is itself the mutant they had originally detected and Krakoa battles the new and old X-Men by forming a giant humanoid body out of its terrain. With a combination of psi interference by Professor X and energy blasts from Cyclops and Havok, Storm is able to supercharge Polaris' magnetic powers with bolts of lightning. Polaris interacts with the Earth's core and creates a magnetic pulse so strong that she is able to launch Krakoa into outer space. The X-Men - now counting thirteen members - are saved.

Later a "son of Krakoa" appeared in ''Excalibur #31'', the result of a spore that was released from Krakoa as it was shot into space.  Nightcrawler eventually defeated this "Vega-Superior" by tricking him into drowning himself.

Krakoa was apparently found and captured for study by the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] known as [[Stranger (comics)|The Stranger]], as seen when [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] visited one of his 'laboratory worlds'. Krakoa was eventually freed as well as many of the specimens.

===''X-Men: Deadly Genesis''===
The 2006 ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' storyline features a major [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] in which it is revealed that many of the elements in Giant-Size X-Men #1 were in fact deceptions and delusions created by Professor X to hide the major part of the story. 
Another team of young mutants, composed of [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], [[Sway (comics)|Sway]], and the [[third Summers brother]] [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Kid Vulcan]], from a parallel X-Mansion led by [[Moira MacTaggert]], were sent to help the original X-Men. They managed to save Cyclops and returned him to Professor X. However Krakoa, no more intelligent than an animal, killed Petra and Sway and left Darwin and Kid Vulcan almost dead. Xavier had erased all records of the real events in Cyclops' mind, and altered the mutants' minds to cast the illusion of a speaking, sentient Krakoa.

===Manifest Destiny===
[[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]'s business partner tells the [[Young X-Men]] that his workers went missing on an uncharted island. This island turns out to be an offshoot of Krakoa.

==Powers and abilities==
In its original depiction, Krakoa was an immensely powerful being. It could manipulate its flora and fauna at will and possessed incredible psi powers, rivaling those of [[Professor X]]; indeed, it was capable of subtly manipulating his mind from a great distance to prevent him contacting experienced heroes for help.  After the revelation of the events surrounding Vulcan, it was revealed that Krakoa was little more than an animal-like system whose intelligence was merely survival instinct. However, given that Professor X continued to recruit a new team of mutants to save the original X-Men rather than contacting an already-existent team for aid, it suggests that Krakoa's ability to influence his mind was a deliberate action on Krakoa's part.

==Other versions==
===[[Amalgam Comics]]===
[[Image: KrakoaDino.jpg|thumb|right|Krakoa the Living Dinosaur Island from [[Amalgam Comics]].]]
Krakoa was combined with [[Dinosaur Island]] to form '''Krakoa the Living Dinosaur Island'''. The insane mutant hater Dr. [[Will Magnus]] and his [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots used Krakoa as their base of operations before their location was discovered by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].

=== Ultimate Krakoa ===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity of ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', Krakoa was reimagined as an apparently normal island near [[Genosha#Ultimate Genosha|Genosha]], on which TV mogul [[Mojo (comics)#Ultimate Mojo|Mojo Adams]] hosts his gruesome reality TV show ''Hunt for Justice'', in which mutant felons are hunted to death. It is where [[Deadpool (comics)#Ultimate Deadpool|Ultimate Deadpool]] takes [[Spider-Man]] and the X-Men in the Deadpool arc of USM.

=== [[What If (comics)|What If?]] ===
Krakoa was featured in various versions of What If?:

* In "What If the X-Men Died on the First Mission," Polaris demagnetizes Krakoa only for the featured X-Men to not be able to get off in time

* In "What If an All New, All Different X-Men Never Existed," the original X-Men had never disbanded and were able to defeat Krakoa easily.

* In ''What If? Deadly Genesis'', Vulcan and his team make their way through the island, surviving its assault. Vulcan becomes separated from the group and finds the captured X-Men. After accidentally killing them all in a panic, Vulcan escapes the temple and, with the rest of his team, the island itself. Krakoa is then jettisoned into deep space, where it remains untouched for years until being discovered by the [[Silver Surfer]]. There, [[Sway (comics)|Sway]] finds a time pocket and uses her powers to replay the events of Vulcan's killings. After confronting and disabling him of his powers, Professor Xavier banishes Vulcan to the island, where he is forced, as punishment, to replay the transpired murders of the X-Men every time he requires food.

* In the story ''What If? Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire'' Krakoa is resurrected by a power-mad Vulcan using the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]], with a battle between him, [[Rachel Summers]], Havok, Cyclops, and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] taking place on it.
