'''Heat Wave (Mick Rory)''' is an [[antihero]] and supervillain  appearing in American [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an enemy of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]] and a member of [[Rogues (comics)|The Rogues]] along with [[Captain Cold]].

Actor [[Dominic Purcell]] has portrayed the character in [[The CW]]'s television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and currently is in ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.

== Publication history ==
Heat Wave was first introduced in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #140 which was written by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]]. He was first made to be a rival for [[Captain Cold]]. However, in recent comics by [[Geoff Johns]], Rory looks to Captain Cold to help him keep his obsession at bay, though Cold thinks he'll eventually become beyond help.

== Fictional character biography ==
Born on a farm outside Central City '''Mick Rory''' became fascinated with [[fire]], as a child.  This fascination turned into an obsession and one night, he set his family's home ablaze. His obsession was so great, that he simply watched the flames engulf his house, instead of running to get help.

After this event, Rory went to live with his uncle. His pyromania continued and he was forced to run away after locking a schoolmate in his house and setting it on fire, after the boy locked Rory in a meat locker during a field trip. He took a job as a [[fire eater]] with a traveling [[circus]]. This did not last long either, as he ended up setting the circus on fire. He has an intense fear of cold, called cryophobia. This was due to a school field trip (noted above) to a slaughterhouse, during which one of his friends locked him in a freezer.

It was these events that made him desperate to fight his fire obsession and after seeing the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] in action in Central City, he decided to use his mania to become a villain. He created a protective costume made of [[asbestos]] (this was back before the dangers of asbestos were known), built a gun-sized [[flamethrower]] (nicknamed the "Hot Rod"), and became Heat Wave. As he was committing crimes in Central City, it was inevitable that he would run into the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], which he did quite regularly. Subsequently, he also ended up in jail quite regularly. He also became an adversary of [[Captain Cold]], due to his aversion to cold temperatures. It was Captain Cold who introduced Heat Wave to the Rogues, and in his first appearance they teamed up to get rid of the Flash as they competed over a newscaster they had both fallen in love with and fought each other as they each tried to compete a larger crime spree, but the Flash jailed them both.

Eventually, Mick went straight, due largely to the manipulations of the [[Top (comics)|Top]]. He took a job as a firefighting consultant, using his vast knowledge on fires and heat. He also became good friends with Barry Allen, whose secret identity as Flash was discovered by Rory years before. Rory later succumbed to an offer by [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] of gaining respect and infamy in the world. He and four other members of the Rogues sacrificed themselves, quite unwittingly, to unleash the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]].<ref>''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' #1 (November 1995)</ref>

Neron returned the soulless bodies of the five to Earth, in a plan to force Flash into a deal.<ref>''Flash'' #126 (June 1997)</ref> The five Rogues each possessed incredible powers and wreaked havoc, death, and destruction before Neron was forced by Flash to halt their actions and return their souls to their bodies.<ref>''Flash'' #129 (September 1997)</ref>

Heat Wave would only briefly return to his criminal ways before abandoning them to study with Zhutanian monks.<ref>''New Year's Evil â€“ The Rogues'' #1 (February 1998)</ref> Afterwards, he worked for [[Project Cadmus]] as a backup agent, but eventually quit that too and moved to the [[Quad Cities]], [[Illinois]] area. He eventually got a job at the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], along with other reformed members of the Rogues. This was a spectacular failure and Rory became a villain once again after the Top arrived and undid the mental program that had kept him reformed.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Heat Wave became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

=== One Year Later ===
In [[One Year Later]], Heat Wave is next seen being recruited by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] to team up against [[Bart Allen]]. He is one of the rogues who deliver the killing blow to Bart. He freaks out about what he and the Rogues have done and flees only to be captured by [[Captain Boomerang]] alongside [[Weather Wizard]]. He is sent to "hell planet" Salvation with the other Rogues. When the conflict starts, he sides with [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]. When they beat [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn]], he's worried about killing another hero, claiming that they will kill them with rusty razors. He returns to Earth with the villains who are still alive.

=== Salvation Run ===
Heat Wave is one of the exiled villains featured in [[Salvation Run]] along with his fellow Rogues: [[Captain Cold]], [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].

=== Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge ===
He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, however, Heat Wave and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used, particularly after they find that [[Paul Gambi]], the Rogues' tailor, has been badly beaten by the 'New Rogues' organised by Libra. During the hunt for Inertia, Heat Wave also kills Burn- his own counterpart in the 'New Rogues'- when the two shoot their weapons at each other, Heat Wave noting that Burn's costume was of poorer quality than his own, allowing him to burn Burn to death while he is barely sweating while subjected to Burn's own weapons. Captain Cold later has him kill Cold's father, abducted by Libra as a hostage against Cold. While Libra tries to hypnotize the Rogues, Captain Cold tells Rory to watch a nearby fire to retain his focus. When they are fighting Inertia, Rory melts his boots, making him unable to move. He then helps the other Rogues kill Inertia.

Once the crisis is over, the unarmed [[Human Flame]] seeks out Heat Wave, hoping to purchase one of his signature flamethrower guns after his own equipment was lost in a confrontation with the Mafia. After learning that the Human Flame can only offer him $5 000, Heat Wave refuses, denouncing Human Flame as "pathetic". Noting that Captain Cold advised against this meeting and he only agreed to see what the other man had to offer, Heat Wave gives Human Flame a harsh beating, the fight concluding with Heat Wave blowing up the fireworks factory they were meeting in, noting that he had always wanted to do something like that.<ref>''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #2 (June 2009)</ref>

=== The Flash (Vol. 3) ===
Heat Wave and the Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words ''In Case of Flash: Break Glass'' written on it.<ref>''Flash Secret Files and Origins'' (2010)</ref> Rory is still on the run with The Rogues.<ref name="theflash1">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)</ref>

=== The New 52 ===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this timeline, Heat Wave is now able to shoot fire from his chest, and has issues with Captain Cold, blaming him for the breakup of the Rogues. Both villains end up being defeated by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], but upon being incarcerated they meet with Cold's sister [[Golden Glider]] who recruits him for an unknown plot.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #11 (July 2012)</ref>

In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Heat Wave and his fellow Rogues are among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] to talk about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==

=== Pre-52 ===
In the Pre-52 continuity Heat Wave had no meta-human abilities; however, he was able to create a [[flamethrower]] that allowed him to project intense streams of flame that reach temperatures well over 900 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. The flame that his weaponry projects is so hot that it has been able to melt Flash's friction proof boots, the same boots that allow Flash to run at light speed. He also has an in-depth knowledge of fire and [[pyrotechnics]].

=== New 52 ===
In the New 52 continuity, Heat Wave merged his [[DNA]] with his flamethrower, thus granting him the ability to project and manipulate fire from his own body.

=== Weapons & Equipment ===
Heat Wave carries a hand held flamethrower that allows him to project a concentrated stream of fire at opponents. He wears an [[asbestos]] suit with a breathing mask that affords him protection against fire and heat. His suit was once shown to be able to project heat as well, capable of staving off an attack from Captain Cold's cold gun, neutralizing solid projectiles, or melting his way through walls. Heat Wave has a pipe attached to his left arm that can project a fire retardant which allows him to put out fires.

* Mick Rory/Heat Wave appears on [[The CW]]'s television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Dominic Purcell]]. This version is depicted as a pyromaniac with burns covering half of his body, including his upper arms. He debuts in the episode "Going Rogue", where his ex-partner [[Leonard Snart]] (played by Purcell's ''[[Prison Break]]'' co-star [[Wentworth Miller]]) recruits him into his criminal gang. Snart offers Rory an experimental 'heat gun' that he stole earlier and proposes that they work together to kill the Flash so that no one could interfere with their crimes in Central City. However, in "Revenge of the Rogues", the Flash tricks Snart and Rory into firing their guns at each other, destroying both weapons. After being apprehended, they are rescued by [[Golden Glider|Snart's sister, Lisa]], and are able to coerce the Flash's ally [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] into recreating their weapons. In season 2, Mick reportedly made off with cash from an interrupted robbery after the Snart siblings were ambushed by their father, Lewis, and he abandoned them ("Family of Rogues"). He later appears along with the other Legends in the crossover episode ''[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]''.
* Heat Wave next appears in the spin-off ''[[DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]'' with Dominic Purcell reprising his role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/03/dominic-purcell-cast-arrow-flash-spinoff-heat-wave-cw-1201393858/|title=Dominic Purcell Joins Arrow/Flash Spinoff|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref> Here, Snart reveals that when he was first sent to juvenile prison, fellow inmate Rory protected the much-smaller Snart from the other inmates. Snart since looked out for Rory, tempering his more violent tendencies. In "Star City 2046", Rory becomes the leader of a criminal gang in a [[dystopia]]n [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] and wants to remain in this alternate reality, as it suits his temperament. Unable to persuade Rory to leave, Snart - for his own reasons - knocks him unconscious and forcibly returns him to the ''Waverider''. This creates tension between the two partners. In "Marooned", [[Rip Hunter]] admits that he only recruited Rory because he wanted Snart, and the two were "a package deal". This leads Rory to betray the team to a band of space pirates and him nearly killing [[Sara Lance|Sara Lance/White Canary]], before being stopped by Snart. Since returning him to 2016 would open the team's family members to retaliation, Snart volunteers to "handle" Rory. He takes his former partner to an isolated area and fires his cold gun at him, distracting Rory in order to knock him out and abandon him. Rory is later revealed to be the Time Masters' bounty hunter '''[[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]]''', saved from near death and trained by the Time Masters at the Vanishing Point some time after Snart "handled" him. He captures Leonard and plans to kill his sister, [[Golden Glider|Lisa]], in front to him. Rory/Chronos later attacks Rip's team, but he is overwhelmed and defeated by them. Imprisoning him on the ''Waverider'', the team elects to try rehabilitating their former teammate. The team not making any headway, Snart proposes that he and Rory settle matters with their fists; if Rory kills Snart, he can escape in the jump-ship and go wherever he likes. Rory soundly beats Snart, but does not kill him, claiming it no longer matters now. He tells the team that the Time Masters have now sent out the Hunters to kill them all, including Rory for failing his mission and realigns himself with the team. Escaping to the town of Salvation in 1871, Rory and the others encounter bounty hunter [[Jonah Hex]], an old friend of Rip's. Rory, Hex and the team are ultimately able to defeat both the Hunters and the Jeb Stillwater gang. Before Rory kills the final Hunter, the latter informs him that an assassin known as the Pilgrim has been sent to kill the team's younger selves in the past. As a young Rory watches his home burn in 1990, the Pilgrim secretly targets him from behind as she prepares to make the kill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/15/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-the-magnificent-eight-review|title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow: "The Magnificent Eight" Review|last=Schedeen|first=By Jesse|website=IGN|access-date=2016-04-17}}</ref> After Snart sacrifices himself to destroy the Time Masters' Oculus device, a more subdued Mick has Rip take him back to Central City in 2013 to see Snart so that he can ensure that his old friend knew how he felt about him: that Snart was "the best guy I ever knew". In the final episode of season 1, [[Rex Tyler]] says that Mick Rory sent him to stop the team from boarding the ''Waverider''. In the second season, Rory is the last member of the team left on the ''Waverider'' after Rip is forced to use the ship to ram a Nazi submarine intending to destroy New York with a nuclear bomb in 1942, initiating a 'time scatter' option to disperse the team across history, Rory remained in the ship because he was too injured to survive the jump, being left in stasis until he was retrieved by Nate Heywood and Oliver Queen, subsequently using the ''Waverider'' to find the rest of the crew across history. During the Legends encounters with the [[Legion of Doom]], he begins seeing visions of Captain Cold, but also begins a friendship with [[Vixen (comics)|Amaya Jiwe]]. In the Episode "Turncoat" Mick has an impression on George Washington. In the episode "Fellowship of the Spear", Mick begins seeing Snart again, and after asking the Legends what it means, they casually brush it off, merely insinuating that Mick misses Snart. Believing that Snart only exists in his mind, he casually tells him of their plan, until it is revealed that Snart is there in person, a past version recruited by the Legion, and uses the information given to him by Mick to ambush the Legends. The Legends angrily reprimand Rory, stating that he will always choose Snart over the team and claiming that he'll never be more than a criminal. Angered and betrayed, Mick gives the Spear to the Legion, who use it to re-write history in their own image. In "Doomworld", Mick later regrets his decision, finding his new life of easy thefts with Snart boring and resenting how Thawne exclusively calls the shots while Snart merely makes vague promises of a 'plan' to deal with him, recruiting his former teammates and giving them back their memories before confronting the Legion. In "Aruba", Mick and the other Legends are forced to go back in time to steal the Spear and fight the Legion before they rewrote reality in the first place, and after confronting Snart, Rory chooses the Legends over his former partner. Following their defeat, Mick personally returns Snart to his original timeline, saying that being a part of the Legends made both of them better men, and erases Snart's memories before leaving. He is responsible for the team coming back together in the third season after he encounters a time-displaced Julius Caesar. While investigating a time aberration in the Vietnam War in 1967, Mick has an unexpected encounter with the contemporary version of his father, forcing him to face his feelings about his father's abusive history. When the Legends learn that current villain Mallus can only be defeated by the six totems of Amaya's tribe, Mick becomes the wielder of the Fire totem after it is retrieved from the Darhks and repowered by Ray Palmer's efforts after it is shattered.
** [[Mitchell Kummen]] portrayed a younger Mick Rory in the episode "Last Refuge",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/shark-week-2016-premiere-date-legends-of-tomorrow-young-heat-wave-mitchell-kummen-1201741391/|title=TV News Roundup: â€˜Legends of Tomorrowâ€™ Casts Young Heat Wave, Shark Week Sets Premiere Date|publisher=Variety|last=Sage|first=Alyssa|date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> when the team rescue him from the fire that killed his parents when he was a child. A conversation with his future self reveals that Mick started the fire- albeit by accident- but the conversation helps Rory accept that his younger self was just a foolish child who didn't know any better rather than causing the fire out of genuine malice, advising his younger self to be better than him.
* In the four-part crossover event "[[Crisis on Earth-X]]," Heat Wave assists in fighting the invaders from Earth-X led by its versions of Green Arrow and Supergirl who have allied with Eobard Thawne. During this time, he has taken a liking to [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]]'s Killer Frost side. When attending the wedding of Barry and Iris, Mick suggests that he be placed on the bride's side as he has tried to kill the groom at least twice, and later states that he only came to the wedding for the free food at the rehearsal. When the Dark Arrow- the Earth-X counterpart to Oliver Queen- attacks S.T.A.R. Labs, Rory is initially the facility's only obvious defence as the other heroes are absent, but soon falls to the Dark Arrow despite hitting him with a near-point-blank flamethrower. There is some tension between Rory and the Earth-X version of Snart, but they eventually accept that they are different people before Snart returns to his universe.
