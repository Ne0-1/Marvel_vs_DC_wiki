'''Heat Wave''' is a fictional villain in the [[DC Universe]] and a primary foe of [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]].

==Fictional character biography==
Born on a farm outside [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], '''Mick Rory''' became fascinated with [[fire]], as a child.  This fascination turned into an obsession and one night, he set his family's home ablaze.  His obsession was so great, that he simply watched the flames engulf his house, instead of running to get help.

After this event, Rory went to live with his uncle.  His [[pyromania]] continued and he was forced to run away after locking a schoolmate in his house and setting it on fire, after the boy locked Rory in a meat locker during a field trip.  He took a job as a [[fire eater]] with a traveling [[circus]].  This did not last long either, as he ended up setting the circus on fire.

It was these events that made him desperate to fight his fire obsession and after seeing the [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues]] in action in Central City, he decided to use his mania to become a villain.  He created a protective costume made of [[asbestos]] (this was back before the dangers of asbestos were known), built a gun-sized [[flamethrower]] and became Heat Wave.  As he was committing crimes in Central City, it was inevitable that he'd run into the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], which he did quite regularly.  Subsequently, he also ended up in jail quite regularly.  He also became an adversary of [[Captain Cold]], due to his aversion to cold temperatures ([[Heat Wave (comics)#Trivia|see below]]).  It was Captain Cold who introduced Heat Wave to the Rogues.

Eventually, Mick went straight, due largely to the manipulations of the [[Top (comics)|Top]].  He took a job as a firefighting consultant, using his vast knowledge on fires and heat.  He also became good friends with Barry Allen, whose secret identity as Flash was discovered by Rory years before.  All good things must come to an end though, and Rory succumbed to an offer by [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] of gaining respect and infamy in the world.  He and four other members of the Rogues sacrificed themselves, quite unwittingly, to unleash the demon [[Neron]].

Neron returned the soulless bodies of the five to Earth, in a plan to force Flash into a deal.  The five Rogues each possessed incredible powers and wreaked havoc, death and destruction before Neron was forced by Flash to halt their actions and return their souls to their bodies.

Heat Wave would only briefly return to his criminal ways before abandoning them to study with [[Zhutanian monks]].  Afterwards, he worked for [[Project Cadmus]] as a backup agent, but eventually quit that too and moved to the [[Quad Cities]], [[Illinois]] area.  He eventually got a job at the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], along with other reformed members of Rogues.  This was a spectacular failure and Rory became a villain once again after the Top arrived and undid the mental program that had kept him reformed.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Heat Wave became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

[[One Year Later]], after a being caught by the police, he and several more of the Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]).  Though Inertia is defeated, he, [[Weather Wizard]], and Captain Cold shot Bart to death and are now on the run. He, Weather Wizard, and Captain Cold seemed to express guilt immediately after Bart's death. 

He is later seen among the exiled Supervillains in [[Salvation Run]].

He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined the [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In "[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]" #1, however, Heat Wave and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.

==Powers and abilities==
Heat Wave carries a hand held flamethrower that allows him to project a concentrated stream of fire at opponents. He wears an asbestos suit with a breathing mask that affords him protection against fire and heat. Heat Wave has a pipe attached to his left arm that can project a fire retardant which allows him to put out fires.

==Other versions==
* Heat Wave has appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-offs comic book. His appearances are in issues # 21
*In [[Tangent Comics]] (now Earth-9 of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]]) Heat-Wave is mentioned as New York's weather-manipulating villain that was defeated by [[Superman]].

==Other media==
* Heat Wave (spelled Heatwave in the show's [[Billing (film)|billing]]) was shown to be a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' voiced by [[Lex Lang]]. He was seen helping [[Giganta]], [[Killer Frost]], and [[Black Manta#In Other Media|Devil Ray]] retrieve a frozen Viking ship containing the Viking Prince's corpse. His job was to defrost the Viking ship. In the ultimate battle he was seen burning [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]] and being struck by [[Silver Banshee]], who was subsequently shot by [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]]. He was with Luthor and the other remaining Secret Society members when it came to Darkseid's invasion upon Earth.
* Heat Wave is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

==Trivia==
{{trivia|date=January 2008}}
Heat Wave has an intense fear of cold, called [[cryophobia]].  This was due to a school field trip (noted above) to a slaughterhouse, during which one of his friends locked him in a walk in freezer.
