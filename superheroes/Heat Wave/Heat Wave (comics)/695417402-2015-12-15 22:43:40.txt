'''Heat Wave''' is a fictional supervillain in the appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]], as a primary foe of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. He is a member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].

==Publication history==
Heat Wave was first introduced in ''The Flash'' #140 which was written by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]]. He was first made to be a rival for [[Captain Cold]], however in recent comics by [[Geoff Johns]], Rory looks to Captain Cold to help him keep his obsession at bay, though Cold thinks he'll eventually become beyond help.

==Fictional character biography==
Born on a farm outside [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], '''Mick Rory''' became fascinated with [[fire]], as a child.  This fascination turned into an obsession and one night, he set his family's home ablaze. His obsession was so great, that he simply watched the flames engulf his house, instead of running to get help.

After this event, Rory went to live with his uncle. His [[pyromania]] continued and he was forced to run away after locking a schoolmate in his house and setting it on fire, after the boy locked Rory in a meat locker during a field trip. He took a job as a [[fire eater]] with a traveling [[circus]]. This did not last long either, as he ended up setting the circus on fire. He has an intense fear of cold, called cryophobia. This was due to a school field trip (noted above) to a slaughterhouse, during which one of his friends locked him in a freezer.
It was these events that made him desperate to fight his fire obsession and after seeing the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] in action in Central City, he decided to use his mania to become a villain. He created a protective costume made of [[asbestos]] (this was back before the dangers of asbestos were known), built a gun-sized [[flamethrower]], and became Heat Wave. As he was committing crimes in Central City, it was inevitable that he'd run into the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], which he did quite regularly. Subsequently, he also ended up in jail quite regularly. He also became an adversary of [[Captain Cold]], due to his aversion to cold temperatures. It was Captain Cold who introduced Heat Wave to the Rogues, and in his first appearance they teamed up to get rid of the Flash as they competed over a newscaster they had both fallen in love with and fought each other as they each tried to compete a larger crime spree, but the Flash jailed them both.

Eventually, Mick went straight, due largely to the manipulations of the [[Top (comics)|Top]]. He took a job as a firefighting consultant, using his vast knowledge on fires and heat. He also became good friends with Barry Allen, whose secret identity as Flash was discovered by Rory years before. Rory later succumbed to an offer by [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] of gaining respect and infamy in the world. He and four other members of the Rogues sacrificed themselves, quite unwittingly, to unleash the demon [[Neron]].<ref>''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' #1 (November 1995)</ref>

Neron returned the soulless bodies of the five to Earth, in a plan to force Flash into a deal.<ref>''Flash'' #126 (June 1997)</ref> The five Rogues each possessed incredible powers and wreaked havoc, death, and destruction before Neron was forced by Flash to halt their actions and return their souls to their bodies.<ref>''Flash'' #129 (September 1997)</ref>

Heat Wave would only briefly return to his criminal ways before abandoning them to study with Zhutanian monks.<ref>''New Year's Evil - The Rogues'' #1 (February 1998)</ref> Afterwards, he worked for [[Project Cadmus]] as a backup agent, but eventually quit that too and moved to the [[Quad Cities]], [[Illinois]] area. He eventually got a job at the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], along with other reformed members of the Rogues. This was a spectacular failure and Rory became a villain once again after the Top arrived and undid the mental program that had kept him reformed.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Heat Wave became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

=== One Year Later ===
In [[One Year Later]], Heat Wave is next seen being recruited by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] to team up against [[Bart Allen]]. He is one of the rogues the deliver thekilling blow to Bart.He freaks out about what he and the Rogues have done and flees only to be captured by [[Captain Boomerang]] alongside [[Weather Wizard]]. He is sent to "hell planet" Salvation with the other Rogues. When the conflict starts he sides with [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]. When they beat [[Martian Manhunter|J"onn]] he's worried about killing another hero, claiming that they will kill them with rusty razors. He returns to earth with the villains who are still alive.

Later he hears Libra's offer and (off-panel) rejects it. When he hears Inertia free he decides with his fellow Rogues to kill him for their troubles. He and the other Rogues find [[Paul Gambi]] seriously injured by a group of Libra's men called the " new" rogues. He receives a new improved costume from Gambi. Heat Wave defeats his "new" rogue counterpart, Burn. Captain Cold has him kill Cold's father. While Libra tries to hypnotize the Rogues, Captain Cold tells him to watch a nearby fire. When they are fighting Inertia, he melts his boots, making him unable to move. He then helps the other Rogues kill Inertia.

Heat Wave meets with the [[Human Flame]], who wants to buy one of Heat Wave's guns. Heat Wave is appalled by the small amount of money he is offered, and beats up the Human Flame. On his way out he blows up the fireworks factory they were meeting in, with the Human Flame still inside.

Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used. Heat Wave also kills Burn- a member of the 'New Rogues' organized by Libra- when the two shoot their weapons at each other, Heat Wave noting that Burn's costume was of poorer quality than his own, allowing him to burn Burn to death while he is barely sweating while subjected to Burn's own weapons.

Once the crisis is over, the unarmed [[Human Flame]] seeks out Heat Wave, hoping to purchase one of his signature flamethrower guns after his own equipment was lost in a confrontation with the Mafia. After learning that the Human Flame can only offer him $5 000, Heat Wave refuses, denouncing Human Flame as "pathetic". Noting that Captain Cold advised against this meeting and he only agreed to see what the other man had to offer, Heat Wave gives Human Flame a harsh beating, the fight concluding with Heat Wave blowing up the fireworks factory they were meeting in, noting that he had always wanted to do something like that.<ref>''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run!'' #2 (June 2009)</ref>

They are rescued by Snart's sister Lisa and are able to force the Flash's ally Cisco Ramon into recreating their weapons and revealing the Flash's identity to Cold, but in a subsequent confrontation with Barry Cold agrees that he will keep the Flash's identity secret, even from his fellow Rogues, and not kill any innocent people, in exchange for not being sent to the Pipeline prison.
