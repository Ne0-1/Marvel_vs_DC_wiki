One of the biggest steps we took in this direction came in ''Captain America''. I enjoyed drawing people of every kind. I drew as many different types of people as I could into the scenes I illustrated, and I loved drawing black people. I always found their features interesting and so much of their strength, spirit and wisdom written on their faces. I approached Stan, as I remember, with the idea of introducing an African-American hero and he took to it right away. ... I looked at several African-American magazines, and used them as the basis of inspiration for bringing The<!--as written in original source--> Falcon to life.<ref>[[Colan, Gene]].

He was introduced as an unnamed former resident of [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood, who had adopted a wild falcon he trained and named Redwing (His own name, Sam Wilson, was not given until page five of the following issue). After Wilson came into conflict with the [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]], Steve Rogers inspired Wilson to take on the costumed identity of the Falcon, and Wilson underwent training with Rogers.<ref>''Captain America'' #117–118 (September–October 1969).

At Rogers' suggestion, the Avengers head to Wakanda with the intention of removing it from Vision (in the hope Vision can function without it) and destroying it so Thanos can't get it. Wilson notifies Rogers of Thanos' invading army and participates in the ensuing battle. When Thanos collects all six stones and does a snap of the fingers, Wilson is among those disintegrated. In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', five years after the events of ''Infinity War'', Wilson is resurrected by [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] along with the rest of the decimated, after the Avengers have retrieved the Infinity Stones from different points in time and used them to undo Thanos' snap. Wilson participates in the final battle against an earlier version of Thanos (as Thanos' older version was killed by [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] after Thanos destroyed the [[Infinity Stones|stones]]). After the battle, during which Stark sacrifices himself in order to destroy Thanos' army, Wilson attends Stark's funeral, and later receives Captain America's shield and mantle from Rogers, now an elderly man (as a result of time travelling into the past to live with [[Peggy Carter]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/avengers-endgame-captain-america-chris-evans-anthony-mackie/|title='Avengers: Endgame' – Let's Talk About the Future of Captain America and Sam Wilson|first1=Trey|last1=Williams|first2=Ross A.|last2=Lincoln|work=The Wrap|date=April 26, 2019|accessdate=April 27, 2019}}</ref>
