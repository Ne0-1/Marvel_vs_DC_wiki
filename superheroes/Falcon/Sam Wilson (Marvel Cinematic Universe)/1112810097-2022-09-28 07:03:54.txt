One of the biggest steps we took in this direction came in ''Captain America''. I enjoyed drawing people of every kind. I drew as many different types of people as I could into the scenes I illustrated, and I loved drawing black people. I always found their features interesting and so much of their strength, spirit and wisdom written on their faces. I approached Stan, as I remember, with the idea of introducing an African-American hero and he took to it right away. ... I looked at several African-American magazines, and used them as the basis of inspiration for bringing The<!--as written in original source--> Falcon to life.<ref>[[Colan, Gene]].

He was introduced as an unnamed former resident of [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood, who had adopted a wild [[falcon]] he trained and named Redwing.

He later became a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Pararescueman]] and served multiple tours in overseas military campaigns.

At Wilson's suggestion, Rogers calls [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] to recruit Lang and retrieve Maximoff.

===Becoming Captain America===
{{see also|The Falcon and the Winter Soldier}}
{{further|New World Order (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|l1=New World Order}}
In 2024, Wilson has returned to work as a contractor with the USAF with support from his friend, USAF first lieutenant [[Joaquin Torres (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Joaquin Torres]]. In Washington, D.C., Wilson gives the shield to the U.S. government so it can be displayed in a [[Smithsonian]] exhibit dedicated to Captain America, believing that he is not worthy of taking up Captain America's mantle. He returns to Delacroix to help his sister, Sarah, with the family business until Torres tells of him an attack carried out by the [[Flag Smashers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Flag Smashers]], a terrorist group that believes life was better during the Blip. Wilson later learns that the U.S. government has named [[John Walker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Walker]] the new Captain America.

====Partnering with Bucky Barnes====
{{further|The Star-Spangled Man|Power Broker (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|l2=Power Broker}}
Wilson is approached by Barnes, who expresses disapproval that the former surrendered the shield before joining him in facing the Flag Smashers and their leader [[Karli Morgenthau]] in [[Munich]], only to discover they all have superhuman strength. Despite receiving aid from Walker and [[Lemar Hoskins (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Lemar Hoskins]], Wilson and Barnes are overpowered and the terrorists escape. Walker requests the pair join him in aiding the Global Repatriation Council (GRC) to quash the ongoing violent post-Blip revolutions, but they decline and head to [[Baltimore]] to meet [[Isaiah Bradley (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Isaiah Bradley]], a [[Korean War]] veteran and super-soldier whom Barnes encountered in battle decades prior, to find out how the Flag Smashers obtained super-solder serum. However, Bradley refuses to help them, revealing he was imprisoned and experimented on by the government for thirty years. Barnes convinces Wilson to travel to [[Berlin]] and meet with the imprisoned Zemo in an effort to obtain information about the Flag Smashers, during which Barnes secretly orchestrates Zemo's escape. Despite his reluctance, Wilson joins Barnes and Zemo in traveling to [[Madripoor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Madripoor]] under assumed names to locate the source of the new super-soldier serum. They learn from high-ranking criminal, Selby, that the [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Broker]] hired former Hydra scientist Dr. Wilfred Nagel to recreate the serum before the trio is compromised and Selby is killed. The trio are saved by the fugitive [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sharon Carter]], who agrees to help them after Wilson offers to get her pardoned. They travel to Nagel's lab and confront him, learning that he created twenty vials of the serum before the Flag Smashers stole them. After Zemo kills Nagel and bounty hunters destroy the latter's lab, Wilson, Barnes, and Carter fight the bounty hunters until Zemo acquires a getaway car to help them escape. While Carter stays behind, Wilson, Barnes, and Zemo travel to [[Latvia]] to find Morgenthau.

====Stopping the Flag Smashers====
{{further|The Whole World Is Watching (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|Truth (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier)|One World, One People|l1=The Whole World Is Watching|l2=Truth}}
Wilson attempts to persuade Morgenthau to end the violence, but an impatient unstable Walker interrupts and she escapes. After she threatens Sarah, Wilson meets with Morgenthau, during which she asks him to join her movement. Walker and Hoskins intervene, leading to a fight in which Morgenthau accidentally kills Hoskins. Enraged by his friend's death and having taken the serum, Walker uses Captain America's shield to kill one of the Flag Smashers in front of a group of horrified bystanders, who film his actions.

Following this, Wilson and Barnes demand the shield from Walker, starting a fight in which Walker destroys Wilson's wingsuit before Wilson and Barnes narrowly take the shield back. After passing on his wingsuit to Torres, Wilson revisits Bradley, but the latter states his belief that a black man cannot, and should not, be Captain America. Wilson returns home to Louisiana and helps fix the family boat, with assistance from several locals as well as Barnes, who delivers a new Captain America suit he acquired from the Wakandans to Wilson. While training with the shield, Wilson and Barnes agree to move on from their pasts and work together as friends.

Accepting his role as the new Captain America and after receiving a lead from Torres, Wilson flies to New York to save the GRC from the Flag Smashers with help from Barnes, Carter, and Walker. Wilson attempts to reason with Morgenthau, but Carter kills her when she points a gun at him. After carrying out Morgenthau's body, Wilson convinces the GRC to postpone their impending vote to force the relocation of Blip-displaced individuals and make efforts to help them instead. He also convinces the government to create a statue honoring Bradley as part of the Smithsonian's Captain America exhibit. Afterward, Wilson returns home and joins his family, Barnes, and his community for a cookout.

==Differences from the comic books==
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2021}}
A number of differences have been observed between the comic book version of the character and the MCU adaptation. The character's comic book backstory is dispensed with entirely, with Wilson instead being introduced with a military background, an aspect that originated from the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate comics]] through which he is able to relate to Rogers.<ref name="CBR Right and Wrong">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-falcon-sam-wilson-mcu-comics-marvel-comparison/|title=Captain America: 5 Things The MCU Gets Wrong About Falcon (& 5 They Got Right)|date=June 3, 2020|website=CBR}}</ref> In the comic book, Wilson has the ability to communicate with birds and is assisted in his heroics by an actual falcon named Redwing. In the films, this is replaced by a drone nicknamed Redwing, which the character is able to control remotely.<ref name="CBR Right and Wrong"/> Wilson's costume is also dramatically different from the bare-chested skintight outfit worn by the character in the comics,<ref name="CBR Right and Wrong"/> instead wearing a utilitarian outfit inspired by the Ultimate Marvel version, though Mackie has indicated that he wanted to wear "red Spandex, head to toe" for the part.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/04/anthony-mackie-on-avengers.html |title=Anthony Mackie on Captain America, Spandex, and Crashing the Avengers Sequel|first1=Kyle|last1=Buchanan|website=[[Vulture.com]]|date=April 2, 2014}}</ref>

In ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'', he wears a red-and silver costume that is closer to the comics. While fighting the [[Flag Smashers]] and [[John Walker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Walker]] however, the former destroys his Redwing drone while the latter destroys his flight suit. Following these, Barnes convinces [[Ayo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ayo]] of [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]'s [[Dora Milaje (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dora Milaje]] to arrange for the construction of a replacement flight suit made of [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Vibranium|vibranium]] and equipped with a pair of Redwing drones.
