The '''Falcon''' (Sam "Snap" Wilson) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] who [[first appeared]] in ''[[Captain America]]'' Vol. 1, #117 (Sept. 1969). Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], the Falcon most frequently works with Captain America, and became a member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. 

The Falcon is Marvel's first [[African American]] superhero, following the company's first African-American co-starring character, the non-superpowered [[World War II]] soldier [[Gabe Jones]], and first regular supporting character, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'''s [[Joe Robertson]] agent. Marvel Comics' first black hero, the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] is an African native. The Falcon debuted nearly three years before [[Luke Cage]], Marvel's first African-American series star. The Falcon is is also the first black superhero not to have the word "black" as part of his superhero name, preceeding the [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] [[Green Lantern]] by over two years. (The first black starring character in comics is [[Dell Comics]]' [[Old West]] [[gunfighter]] [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], introduced in 1965.

The Falcon's deceased nephew was the [[Incredible Hulk]]'s sometime-sidekick [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]], one of the first openly [[HIV-positive]] comic-book characters.

==Fictional character biography==
The Falcon originated as a hoodlum known as "Snap" Wilson.  One day, on the way to [[Rio de Janeiro]], he crash-landed on Exile Island.  There, he was found by the [[Red Skull]], who used the [[Cosmic Cube]] to turn him into an ideal partner for [[Captain America]] as part of one of his schemes.  They defeated the Skull, and the Falcon became Cap's partner for a long time.

In a two-part [[retcon]] story<ref>''Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty'' #8-9 (April - May, 1999)</ref> set in his early career as Captain America's partner, the character briefly takes on the "Captain America" costume and identity.

Back in his "Falcon" name and costume, Wilson later receives help from the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] who creates a harness for him which allowes him to fly.  The Falcon ultimately left as Cap's partner when he was named the leader of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Super Agents.

Later, as one of the few black superheroes active, he was drafted to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] to fill a quota.  Resenting being a "token," he quit at the first opportunity.

At one point, a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] chased him, believing him to be a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], but this was later debunked and the Sentinel is presumed to have been malfunctioning.

In mid-2000s stories, the insane [[Scarlet Witch]] destabilized the Falcon's mind, reverting him to  his "Snap" persona. While he continued to work with Captain America, their relationship became strained and Captain American eventually severed it.  In an antagonist's attempt to shoot the Falcon, Captain America was instead hit in the back.  After eventually recovering from his wound, Captain America searched for the now-missing Falcon. After being told that the Falcon had been assassinated by the supervillain the [[Anti-Captain]], Captain America found the Falcon's costume abandoned in a field.

With nothing explaining his reappearance, the Falcon has been subsequently seen on the way to Genosha<ref>''[[House of M]]'' #1</ref> as well as later in subsequent appearances.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #12</ref><ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref>.  He has joined with Captain America against the Superhuman Registration Act, and, when Cap is incapacitated, temporarily assumes leadership of the "Secret Avengers"<ref>''Civil War #4''</ref>.

==Powers and tools==
The Falcon's only super-power is his empathic link with his bird Redwing endowed by the Red Skull using the Cosmic Cube.  Recently, the Falcon has been able to extend his empathic link to other birds making it possible for him see through their eyes, similar to [[The Beastmaster (film)|Dar]] in [[The Beastmaster (film)|The Beastmaster]] movie and television series.

For a time, he flew using a specially built harness that resembles wings.  After its destruction, the Black Panther supplied him with a new harness with hard-light wings, which can be configured into several different modes.

He is also an excellent bird trainer, and has been trained in gymnastics and hand-to-hand combat by Captain America.

==Alternate reality versions==
===''U.S. War Machine''===
In the [[Marvel MAX]] series ''[[War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Falcon appeared alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]; he and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] served as [[Captain America]]'s backup and wore no costumes, only being addressed by their real names.  In this reality, [[Captain America]] was actually [[Bucky]] wearing the Captain's uniform as here the Captain had died in [[World War II]] in his stead.

===Ultimate Falcon===

Falcon appears in the mini-series [[Ultimate Nightmare]], which takes place in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity.  Not much is known about the Ultimate version of Falcon, except that he appears to have an entirely different origin than the original Falcon, is a scientist, has served with or under General Nick Fury, and wears a pair of metal wings similar to the harness given to the original Falcon by Black Panther.  This version appears to be an accomplished combatant, especially when using the sharp edge of the metal wings he wears as a weapon. His wings are controlled through the help of [[nanotechnology]] with which he can communicate and which can also send and retrieve computer information.

Ultimate Falcon also appears in the second [[Ultimates]] annual, where he teams up with Captain America.
