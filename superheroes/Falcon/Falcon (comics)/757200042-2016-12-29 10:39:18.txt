'''Falcon''' ('''Sam Wilson''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], and introduced in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #117 (Sept. 1969), the character is mainstream comics' first [[African-American]] superhero.<ref name="BlackHistory">Brothers, David. [http://marvel.com/news/story/15240/a_marvel_black_history_lesson_pt_1#ixzz1QFnuw5Yi "A Marvel Black History Lesson Pt. 1"], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]], February 18, 2011. [http://www.webcitation.org/5zhBRA0i5 WebCitation archive]. Quoting Marvel Senior Vice President of Publishing Tom Brevoort: "The Falcon was the very first African-American super hero, as opposed to The Black Panther, who preceded him, but wasn't American."</ref> Falcon uses mechanical wings to fly and has limited telepathic and empathic control over birds. Following Steve Rogers' retirement, Sam Wilson becomes the newest '''Captain America''' and leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. A similar, unrelated character of the same name and powers was created in 1939 by writer-artist [[Bill Everett]] for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, [[Timely Comics]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The Falcon's deceased nephew was the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'s sometime-sidekick [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]], one of the first openly [[HIV-positive]] comic-book characters. Jim Wilson's father Gideon Wilson would go on to join the [[Gamma Corps]]. Sam also has a sister named Sarah Casper and a nephew,<ref>''Captain America'' #134</ref> named Jody Toby Casper and an unnamed niece.<ref>''All-New Captain America'' #6</ref>

[[Anthony Mackie]] portrays Falcon in the 2014 [[Marvel Studios]] film, ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' and reprises his role in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015) and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).

==Publication history==
The Falcon, the first [[African-American]] [[superhero]] in mainstream [[comic books]],<ref name="BlackHistory"/> [[first appeared]] in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #117 (Sept. 1969).<ref name=gcd117>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/22963/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Captain America #117|publisher=}}</ref> Marvel had previously introduced the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], a native of the fictional [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] country [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]].

The Falcon followed the company's first African-American co-starring character, the non-superpowered [[World War II]] soldier [[Gabe Jones]], and first regular supporting character, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]] of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. The Falcon debuted nearly three years before [[Luke Cage]], Marvel's first African-American series star, and almost six years before the African character [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the first black female, and also precedes Marvel's British vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], also created by Colan, by almost four years. The Falcon is also the first superhero of African descent not to have the word "black" as part of his superhero name, preceding the [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] [[Green Lantern]] by over two years. The first African-American starring character in comics is [[Dell Comics]]' [[Old West]] [[gunfighter]] [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], introduced in 1965.

Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gene Colan]],<ref name=gcd117 /> he came about, Colan recalled in 2008,
{{quote|text=...in the late 1960s [when news of the] [[Vietnam War]] and [[civil rights]] protests were regular occurrences, and Stan, always wanting to be at the forefront of things, started bringing these headlines into the comics. ... One of the biggest steps we took in this direction came in ''Captain America''. I enjoyed drawing people of every kind. I drew as many different types of people as I could into the scenes I illustrated, and I loved drawing black people. I always found their features interesting and so much of their strength, spirit and wisdom written on their faces. I approached Stan, as I remember, with the idea of introducing an African-American hero and he took to it right away. ... I looked at several African-American magazines, and used them as the basis of inspiration for bringing The<!--as written in original source--> Falcon to life.<ref>[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]]. "Introduction," ''Marvel Masterworks: Captain American Volume 4'' (Marvel Publishing : New York, 2008), p. 2 of introduction (unnumbered)</ref>}}

He was introduced as an unnamed former resident of [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood, who had adopted a wild falcon he trained and named Redwing. (His own name, '''Sam Wilson''', was not given until page five of the following issue.) When a group of men on an island "in the tropics" wanted a hunting falcon, Wilson answered the ad, only to discover that the self-dubbed "Exiles" were former [[Nazi]]s in league with the [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]]. He escaped, but remained on the island to organize the natives to confront the Exiles, who had turned them into [[serf]]s. At the urging of Steve Rogers, whom he later learned was Captain America, Wilson took on the costumed identity of the Falcon and underwent training with Rogers in order to better inspire the villagers and lead the fight.<ref>''Captain America'' #117–118 (September–October 1969). Writer: [[Stan Lee]]. [[Penciler]]: [[Gene Colan]]. Publisher: [[Magazine Management Company]]. Brand: [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

Through most of the 1970s, the Falcon and Captain America were a team in New York City, and the series was cover-billed ''Captain America and the Falcon'' from issues #134–192 and 194–222 (February 1971&nbsp;– June 1978),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1860/covers/ ''Captain America'' cover scans, page 1] to [http://www.comics.org/series/1860/covers/?page=4 page 4], at the Grand Comics Database</ref> though still copyrighted as ''Captain America.'' In issue #186 (June 1975), writer [[Steve Englehart]] [[retconned]] aspects of the Falcon's past. Originally depicted as a former [[social worker]], motivated by a desire to better the lives of inner-city youth, the Falcon was revealed as a mob-connected thug whose memories were altered by the reality-warping [[Cosmic Cube]].

The Falcon briefly joined the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], appearing in issues #62–64 (August–October1978), and was a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] from issues #183–194 (May 1979&nbsp;– April 1980). He starred in his own four-issue miniseries in 1983, written by [[Jim Owsley]]. Its first issue was illustrated by [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] with the final three issues by [[M. D. Bright|Mark Bright]]. The series revealed that the Falcon was a [[mutant (comics)|mutant]], although this development was later retconned in the ''Avengers 2001 Annual''.<ref>{{cite web|work=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com|date=December 10, 2011|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/12/10/the-abandoned-an-forsaked-the-falcon-is-a-mutant/|title=The Abandoned An' Forsaked – The Falcon is a Mutant?!|first=Brian|last=Cronin}}</ref>

After regularly appearing in ''Captain America'' vol. 2 (November 1996&nbsp;– November 1997), the Falcon rejoined the Avengers in ''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 (February 1998). This time, he remained with the team, becoming one of its most prominent members by issue #57 (Oct. 2002). Concurrently, he was also a supporting character in ''Captain America'' vols. 3–4 (January 1998&nbsp;– February 2002 and June 2002&nbsp;– December 2004). The Falcon next appeared in the short-lived ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'' series, in 2004 and 2005. After the events of the storyline "[[Avengers Disassembled]]", when the [[Scarlet Witch]] temporarily restored his criminal personality, the Falcon became a supporting character in ''Captain America'' vol. 5 (January 2005&nbsp;– July 2009). The Falcon continued to play a significant role in the series after it returned to its original numbering, beginning with ''Captain America'' #600 (Aug. 2009).

Falcon was a member of the Avengers in the 2012 [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/avengers-lineup-revealed-marvel-now.html |title=UPDATED: 1st Look at Marvel NOW!

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Samuel Thomas Wilson was born in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], to Paul Wilson, a prominent minister, and Darlene Wilson. Wilson has a happy childhood and finds he has a natural affinity for birds. He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest pigeon coop in Harlem.<ref name="Lee, Stan 1969">Lee, Stan ''Captain America'' #117–119 (Sept.–Nov. 1969)</ref> In his teens, however, encounters with racism leave him jaded.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186</ref> When he is 16, Wilson refuses to join the church, believing his deeply religious parents to be ignorant for their faith. To his surprise, rather than put up a fight, his parents provide him with books on different religions and comparative theology. The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight (originally Paul was said to have been killed when Sam was 9 years old).<ref>''Captain America'' #277</ref> Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment. Consumed by grief and "angry at the world" Sam turns his back on his past as a respected community volunteer. He moves to [[Los Angeles]] and creates a new persona: "Snap" Wilson, a professional criminal and gang member.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' volume 3, #64</ref><ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon'' #7</ref>

While Snap is on his way to "a big score in [[Rio de Janeiro]]", his plane crashes on Exile Island (years later, he would say "I actually loved this place quite a bit. It's where I met my two best friends," referring to Captain America and Redwing).<ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon'', #11</ref> The once-peaceful island had been taken over by the [[Exiles (Red Skull allies)|Exiles]], a group of would-be world conquerors who had collaborated with the [[Nazi]] [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]] during [[World War II]]. More recently, they had been betrayed by the Red Skull, and were forced to remain in hiding on the island, enslaving the natives. Wilson finds and befriends [[Redwing (Marvel Comics)|Redwing]], a falcon with which he feels a remarkably strong bond.<ref>''Captain America'' #186</ref>

===Becoming the Falcon===
As part of a plot against Captain America, the Red Skull uses the [[Cosmic Cube]], a creation that allows its user to alter reality, to mentally fuse Wilson with Redwing, creating a "super-normal mental link" that would, with time and concentration, give Wilson broad powers over all birds.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186 (June 1975).</ref><ref>Johns, Geoff. ''The Avengers'' #475 / vol. 3, #60 (Jan. 2003).</ref> Next, the Skull uses the Cube to rewrite the past and erase the years Wilson had spent angrily living as Snap Wilson. In this new history, Wilson was an upright and cheerful [[social worker]] who is eventually lured to the Exiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom. Steve Rogers (Captain America) befriends him there and convinces Wilson to adopt a persona to inspire the natives in their rebellion. The two create the costumed persona the Falcon, and train together extensively before attacking and defeating the Exiles and the Red Skull.<ref name="Lee, Stan 1969"/> The Falcon becomes Captain America's regular partner in crime-fighting,<ref>''Captain America'' #133</ref> and briefly even takes on the Captain America costume and identity when Rogers is believed to have been killed.<ref>''[[Captain America|Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty]]'' #8–9 (April–May 1999)</ref>

Later, again as the Falcon, Wilson receives help from the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], who creates a harness for Wilson, allowing him to fly.<ref>Englehart, Steve, and Mike Friedrich. ''Captain America'' #170 (Feb. 1974)</ref> When Rogers briefly abandons his Captain America identity, others attempt to take up the mantle, including a young man named Roscoe whom the Falcon mentors. When the Red Skull eventually kills Roscoe, Rogers again becomes Captain America.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #181–183 (Jan.–March 1975)</ref>

Soon afterwards, the Red Skull reveals the Falcon's true past as Snap Wilson, and unsuccessfully attempts to use the Cosmic Cube to make the Falcon kill Captain America.<ref>Englehart, Steve, and John Warner. ''Captain America'' #186 (June 1975)</ref> Now aware of his past but deciding to continue as a hero, the Falcon is eventually named head of the Super Agents at the [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>Glut, Donald F. ''Captain America'' #218 (Feb. 1978)</ref>

US government superhero liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] then recruits the Falcon, one of the few active African-American superheroes, to fill a mandated racial quota for the venerable team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #184 (June 1979)</ref> Resentful of being a "token", the Falcon quits at the first opportunity. He debuts a new costume when he fights the supervillain [[Taskmaster]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #11</ref>

===2000s===
Falcon becomes a member of the new team of Avengers assembled to fight the international menace [[S.C.O.R.P.I.O (comics)|Scorpio]] as a United Nations peacekeeping agency. By this point, Falcon had discovered that he could extend his telepathic bond with Redwing, allowing him to control other birds and "see" through their eyes. He uses this ability to spy on Henry Gyrich (now the Avengers' liaison with the United Nations) and discovers that the United States' Secretary of Defense, Dell Rusk, has been pressuring Gyrich to spy on the Avengers and turn over their secrets. Although initially hostile to one another, Falcon convinces Gyrich to help the Avengers spy on Rusk, feeding him false information while gathering evidence to expose him. They discover that Rusk is actually the Red Skull, who has launched a biological weapon attack on America, intending to use the ensuing panic to gain control over America's government and start a war with other countries. Falcon is instrumental in defeating the Red Skull.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'', Volume 3, #57–70</ref>

It is around this period of time that, a new "Captain America" secretly created by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (O.N.I.) goes rogue and begins eliminating anything and anyone he sees as a source of terrorism. To draw out this agent (dubbed "The [[Anti-Cap]]"), O.N.I. leaks information about their involvement in a [[biological weapons]] project with the notorious Rivas Family, powerful Cuban drug lords. Reporter and social activist Leila Taylor investigates this rumor and attempts to smuggle a sample of the virus into America, but she is arrested by U.S. forces in Cuba. Falcon, who is a friend of Taylor, breaks her out of prison and investigates her claims, destroying the Rivas Family's biological weapons lab and obtaining a sample of the mysterious virus they were developing for O.N.I. Falcon is able to fly Leila back to America (although his flying harness is destroyed in a hurricane) while Captain America follows Falcon's directions and retrieves the virus sample. The Anti-Cap kills the head of the Rivas family, and pursues Leila, Falcon, and Cap, intent on obtaining the virus sample. After reuniting, Falcon and Captain America are able to barely defeat the Anti-Cap. Realizing that O.N.I.'s goal was to draw out their rogue agent to execute him, Captain America arranges to have the Anti-Cap secretly imprisoned in the Wakandan embassy until O.N.I. agrees not to kill him.{{issue|date=August 2015}}

Since Captain America and Falcon now possess both O.N.I.'s rogue agent and the last remaining sample of O.N.I.'s virus, O.N.I. begins to put increasing amounts of pressure on the heroes. Falcon is especially targeted – he had broken Leila out of Federal Custody, and his criminal history makes it easier for O.N.I. to create further false charges against him. Falcon soon finds himself on the run from O.N.I.{{issue|date=August 2015}}

Meanwhile, the superheroine the [[Scarlet Witch]], having gone insane, begins using her powers to re-create many of the Avengers' greatest trials and tragedies. She destabilizes the Falcon's mind, causing him to act increasingly like his "Snap" persona. He begins carrying a gun, keeps secrets from his friends, assaults Leila's boyfriend Norman when he protests they go into hiding, and uses a high power rifle to shoot at his friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] (to fool Robbie into thinking O.N.I. was threatening to kill him). Although they succeed in exposing the illegal activities of O.N.I. and clear Wilson's name, Sam's methods cause his relationship with Captain America to become strained. Cap confronts Falcon about his recent actions, and Falcon, angered at what he sees as an ultimatum, terminates their partnership. As they are walking away, Norman (who blames Falcon for the end of his relationship with Leila) appears and shoots at Falcon. Captain America is seriously injured by the stray bullets, and even appears to die. The shock of watching his best friend seemingly die because of his actions has a powerful affect on Sam, who briefly gives up being Falcon and reexamines his life.<ref>Priest, Christopher J. ''Captain America and the Falcon''. #1–14</ref>

Sam Wilson reappears as Falcon in the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline and in the 2006–07 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.<ref>''[[House of M]]'' #1, ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #12, ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref> In the latter, he supports Captain America against the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. When the Captain becomes incapacitated, Falcon temporarily assumes leadership of the "Secret Avengers" rebel group.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref> Following Captain America's assassination by the machinations of the Red Skull, the Falcon registers with the government and is made responsible for Harlem, although he continues to maintain contact with the underground [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>{{cite comic|title=Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America|story=The Death of Captain America, Chapter 5: Acceptance|date=August 2007|issue=5|writer=[[Jeph Loeb]]|artist=[[John Cassaday]]}}</ref> He is also called upon to investigate the Captain's assassination by locating [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]] and tracking down the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' vol.5, #31–33 (Dec. 2007&nbsp;– Feb. 2008), Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===

Falcon appears in the 2010 ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, after which he becomes an operative in the new incarnation of the [[Heroes for Hire]] team, in the book of the same name.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 4 #1</ref> He later appears in the 2012 ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, helping [[She-Hulk]] and several other Avengers contain the students at the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #266</ref>

During the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' relaunch, Falcon rejoins the Avengers after [[Iron Man]] and Captain America choose to expand the team's line-up.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 5) #1</ref> After Rogers is aged into an old man, he appoints Falcon as his 'official' replacement as Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol.7) #25</ref> During a confrontation with the Red Skull's daughter Sin, it is revealed that the "Snap" identity was a fake memory implanted into Sam by the Red Skull in an attempt to discredit the hero through racism.<ref>''All-New Captain America'' #3</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Captain America investigated the disappearance of Mexican teenager Joaquin Torres after he was abducted by the [[Sons of the Serpent]].<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #1</ref> After fighting [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]] and capturing the leader of the hate group,<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #2</ref> Captain America discovered that Joaquin was being used in the experiments of [[Karl Malus]] who turned Joaquin into a bird/human hybrid using Captain America's pet bird Redwing. When Karl Malus was defeated, Captain America took Joaquin in.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #3</ref> When it was discovered Joaquin's bird/human hybrid condition wasn't temporary, Captain America learned from [[Claire Temple]] that Joaquin's condition was permanent due to Redwing being vampiric and sporting a healing factor.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4</ref> When Captain America was captured by the Serpent Society and thrown out the window by [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], he was saved by Joaquin.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #5</ref> Using his link with Redwing, Captain America telepathically sent Joaquin the knowledge on how to fight where he held his own until [[Misty Knight]] and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]] showed up. After the Serpent Society was defeated, Captain America allowed Joaquin to become his sidekick, enabling him to become the new Falcon.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #6</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Sam, after defeating the Green Skull, is contacted by Whisperer (an alias of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]). After meeting Whisperer, he learns that S.H.I.E.L.D. never discarded the Kobik project as he thought they did. He meets with Steve Rogers, where they follow a lead to a town in [[Connecticut]] and are later picked up by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha!'' #1</ref> He then meets the [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]] and rescue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Avril Kincaid from the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]], who informs them of a super-weapon hidden in the town that [[Baron Helmut Zemo |Baron Zemo]] and the other villains are looking for. They then head to the bowling alley where Kobik uses her powers to restore Steve Rogers to his prime when he was about to be killed by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. They begin looking for Kobik again only to discover that Baron Zemo had [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] invent a device that would help find Kobik as [[Kraven the Hunter]] rallies the villains to help with their goals. Upon not being able to successfully locate Kobik, Steve Rogers decides to rally the heroes so that they can take the fight to Baron Zemo.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7-8</ref> In the aftermath of the incident, Steve and Sam plan to keep what happened at Pleasant Hill under wraps at the time being.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref>

After the ''Standoff!'' event, Sam begins to face public backlash over the fact that people want him to return the shield and mantle of Captain America to Steve and that Maria Hill will not be facing the consequences of what happened on Pleasant Hill. He and Steve then begin to secretly plan for a way to get Hill to face her crimes publicly. During a press conference, Sam encounters the mercenary [[Chance (comics)|Chance]] who was about to kill Steve in the middle of his speech. After defeating him, Sam receives a hero's welcome when Steve announces him to the public as Captain America. While getting arrested, Chance tells Sam that he was on Pleasant Hill and that he didn't agree with the heroes' actions.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #9</ref> 

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Captain America attended [[War Machine]]'s funeral, where he delivered an inspirational speech. Months later, Wilson watched a TV broadcast about former New Warrior [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] engaging in a fight with the Americops, a private police force funded by Keane Industries, in [[Brooklyn]]. Intending to stop the fight, Wilson, along with Redwing and Falcon, left to try to contain the situation. Sam managed to stop the fight, although not without fighting the Americops, for which he knew the media would portray him negatively. As he was leaving, he was suddenly attacked from behind by [[U.S. Agent]]. After a brief argument, Captain America and U.S. Agent begin to fight, with U.S. Agent gaining the upper hand, until Sam drags him into a tunnel where the darkness and the great horned owls that reside in it allow him to win the fight. After defeating U.S. Agent and receiving an argument from Rage, Wilson returns to his headquarters, where he decides to put a tiny implant in his brain that will enhance his ability to see what birds see, enabling him to transmit them into a data storage facility, that converts them into images and videos. He then decides to further investigate the Americops, to find proof of their violent activities.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #10-13</ref> 

While accompanying Steve Rogers on a mission to stop [[Flag-Smasher]]'s latest assault, Wilson fails to save a senator from being shot by the villain, further compromising his current public image. This is subsequently revealed to have been deliberately staged by Rogers - currently converted to believe himself to have been a Hydra sleeper agent since childhood. Using his greater familiarity with the shield, Rogers deliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save the senator, with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the point where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will (not wanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyr).<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #14</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==

===Powers===
In his earliest appearances Falcon exhibits a close bond with his bird Redwing, which is confirmed as being a telepathic link by [[Professor X]] in ''Captain America'' #174 . The [[Red Skull]] later reveals that he had used the [[Cosmic Cube]] to create a "super-normal mental link" between Sam Wilson and Redwing.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186. Marvel Comics, 1975</ref> Falcon later recalled the experience, stating "Hurt like ''hell''. Being mentally ''fused'' with that falcon. Able to ''see'' through ''his'' eyes."<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #60. Marvel Comics, 2003</ref>

Falcon eventually revealed that he has been able to extend this empathic link. "I'm always psychically connected with Redwing, but through concentration I've recently tapped into another ability – I'm able to link-up with other birds. ... I have over six ''billion'' pairs of eyes in the United States alone." He used this ability to quickly search New York City when the criminal [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] kidnapped two children,<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #64. Marvel Comics, 2003</ref> as well as to spy on Senator Dell Rusk (actually the Red Skull in disguise) and Henry Peter Gyrich.<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #61–69. Marvel Comics, 2003–2004</ref> He is also apparently able to access the memories of birds, and see things they had witnessed in the past (although birds have a different concept of the passage of time, which makes it difficult for him to know when any events they witnessed occurred).<ref>Brubaker, Ed. ''Captain America'' vol. 5 #35. Marvel Comics, 2008</ref>

===Uniform and flight harness===
The Falcon's original wing harness featured detachable jet-powered glider wings made of lightweight titanium ribbing and Mylar. The wings were covered with wafer-thin solar power receptors that convert sunlight into electricity to power miniature high-speed electric turbine fans in his uniform and boots. The wings detached and reattached to his uniform cybernetically. The harness was destroyed in ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'' #2 (2004). The uniform was made of synthetic stretch fabric lined with a steel-alloy mesh.{{Issue|date=June 2008}}

After the original flying harness's destruction in a 2004 storyline,<ref>Priest, Christopher (w). ''Captain America and the Falcon #2'' (2004). Marvel Comics</ref> the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] supplied Falcon with a new costume and wings. An emitter array on Falcon's back creates holographic "hard light" wings with a maximum wingspan of up to {{convert|50|ft|m}}. Controlled by a cybernetic link, the wings can be instantly reconfigured into "dozens of different cruise configurations". A "magnetic drive", in turn, provides the thrust needed to get Falcon airborne. The emitter also possesses GPS jamming devices that prevent [[satellite]] tracking, while the hard-light wings interfere with infra-red tracking. A [[vibranium]] microweave was added to the costume itself, making Falcon resistant to small arms fire.<ref>Priest, Christopher ''Captain America and the Falcon #6'', Marvel Comics (2004)</ref> The entire system is controlled mentally through cybernetic circuitry in the Falcon's mask. The costume has in the past featured a hidden "talon," a cybernetically controlled grappling line built into the gauntlets of his costume which he uses to entangle opponents, hook objects, or for swinging and climbing when his wings are detached. The costume's visors come equipped with various capabilities, including infrared lenses, giving him the ability to see objects by their infrared signature at night, magnification capabilities, and remote imaging sensors that allow a full 360 degree of vision when activated. The cowl also has a wide band receiver and transmitter with an unspecified range. The suit was originally built by the Black Panther,<ref>''Captain America'' #170 (February 1974).

==Other versions==

* In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Samuel Wilson is an explorer, adventurer, and scientist who uses a backpack with high-tech folding wings to fly. Wilson first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Galactus trilogy#Ultimate Nightmare|Ultimate Nightmare]]'' and then worked on the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], demonstrating a high level of technological understanding and confronted [[M.O.D.O.K.|George Tarleton]] of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] aboard a space station studying a [[Gah Lak Tus]] module.<ref>''Ultimate Nightmare'' #1–5</ref> He is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. rather than an official member of [[the Ultimates]] or Reserves. He has served with or under General [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]], and was a member of the armed forces but retired to pursue scientific interests. This version appears to be an accomplished combatant, especially when using the sharp edge of the metal wings he wears as a weapon, which are controlled through the help of [[nanotechnology]], with which he can communicate and retrieve computer information. The wings are partially self-repairing, as referenced in ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Extinction'' #1–5</ref>
* In Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] series ''[[War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Falcon appeared alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]; he and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] served as [[Captain America]]'s backup and wore no costumes, only being addressed by their real names. In this reality, [[Captain America]] was actually [[Bucky]] wearing the Captain's uniform as here the Captain had died in [[World War II]] in his stead.
* In the 2006 comic ''[[What If (comics)|What If Captain America had fought in the Civil War?]]'', the [[Earth-717]] version of Wilson was an orphan raised by a [[Shawnee]] [[medicine man]], and grew up to fight in the [[American Civil War]] as part of an Indian volunteer regiment. He performs a ritual to give Steven Rogers the power of We-Pi-Ahk, the Eagle Spirit, and has a red eagle painted on his chest for this ceremony. He is killed by [[Bucky Barnes|Colonel Barnes]] (who in this reality is the White Skull).
* In the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" universe, created by [[Franklin Richards]], a version of Samuel Wilson/Falcon appears. His father, Abraham "Abe" Wilson fought alongside Captain America during [[World War II]], but is later killed by [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]'s army.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> During the fight, Abe's son Sam Wilson is shot in a fight and gravely wounded, but Captain America saves his life by giving him a transfusion of the Super-Soldier's own blood. Consequently, Wilson gains superhuman abilities comparable to those of Captain America. His military nickname, "The Falcon", becomes his superhero code name, avenges his father by beating Master Man, and along with Captain America, and [[Nick Fury]] defeat the [[Red Skull]]'s plans for world domination.<ref>''Captain America'' v2 #1–12</ref>
* In an alternate timeline seen in ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'', Sam was succeeded as the Falcon by his daughter Samantha. Samantha is shown as a member of the Avengers alongside her husband [[Elijah Bradley|Eli]] (the new Captain America), and their son Steve (the new [[Bucky (comics)|Bucky]]).<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade – Young Avengers'' #1</ref>
* In ''[[Daredevil: End of Days]]'', Wilson is briefly shown as the future president of the United States of America.<ref>''Daredevil: End of Days'' #2</ref>
* During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, an alternate, naturally-winged version of Sam Wilson is a member of the Thor Corps (which are the police force of [[Battleworld]]). He and the Thor Corps members arrest [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)#America Chavez|Miss America]] after she violates [[Doctor Doom|Doom]]'s laws by throwing a [[Megalodon]] that attacked Arcadia far enough to go over the Shield and end up in the Deadlands.<ref>''A-Force'' #1</ref>
* A female version of Sam Wilson (Samantha T. Wilson) serves as the original Captain America of the ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' universe of Earth-65. When World War II struck, she became one of the first female African-American pilots in the U.S. military. Eventually, she was recruited into Project Rebirth, and was chosen to undergo the procedure  when the other candidates [[Bucky|Bucky Barnes]], [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], and [[Isaiah Bradley]] were badly injured by Nazi agents. After this, she became Captain America, and fought the Nazis. When the Nazis attempted to summon creatures from another dimension, she entered said dimension to hold off the invading forces, un-aging in this reality for nearly 75 years. When she finally defeated them and returned to her home dimension of Earth-65, she was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. director Peggy Carter to continue her service as Captain America as one of her agents.<ref name="auto">''Spider-Gwen'' vol. 2 #2</ref>
** Another version of Sam Wilson appears in the ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' universe of Earth-65. He is the male clone of Samantha Wilson and is also this universe's Falcon where he works as Captain America's sidekick. Falcon is known as Sam 13 and is an expert sniper-assassin. He is aided by Redwing (who in this reality is a robotic falcon) where Sam 13 used him for assault and reconnaissance. Falcon and Redwing first come into contact with Spider-Woman while she was fighting Lizard.<ref name="auto"/>
