{{Otheruses|Falcon (disambiguation)}}

The '''Falcon''' ('''Sam "Snap" Wilson''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] who [[first appeared]] in ''[[Captain America]]''  #117 (Sept. 1969). Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], the Falcon most frequently works with Captain America, and became a member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

The Falcon is mainstream comics' first [[African American]] superhero{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}; Marvel's previously introduced [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] is [[African]], a native of the fictional country [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]. The Falcon follows the company's first African-American co-starring character, the non-superpowered [[World War II]] soldier [[Gabe Jones]], and first regular supporting character, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'''s [[Joe Robertson]].  The Falcon debuted nearly three years before [[Luke Cage]], Marvel's first African-American series star, almost six years before [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] (the first black female), and is also the first superhero of African descent not to have the word "black" as part of his superhero name, preceding the [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] [[Green Lantern]] by over two years. (The first black starring character in comics is [[Dell Comics]]' [[Old West]] [[gunfighter]] [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]], introduced in 1965.)

The Falcon's deceased nephew was the [[Incredible Hulk]]'s sometime-sidekick [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]], one of the first openly [[HIV-positive]] comic-book characters. Jim Wilson's father Gideon Wilson would go on to join the [[Gamma Corps]]. Gideon would presumably be Sam's older brother. Sam also has a sister named Sarah Casper and a niece Jody Casper.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Samuel Thomas Wilson was born  in [[Harlem]], [[New York|New York City]], to Darlene Wilson, and Paul Wilson, a prominent minister.  Wilson has a happy childhood and finds he has a natural affinity for birds.  He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest pigeon coop in Harlem<ref name="Lee, Stan 1969">Lee, Stan ''Captain America'' #117-119 (Sept.-Nov. 1969)</ref>.  In his teens, however, encounters with racism leave him jaded.<ref>Englehart, Steve.  Captain America 186</ref>   When he is 16, Wilson refuses to join the church, believing his deeply religious parents to be ignorant for their faith.  To his surprise, rather than put up a fight, his parents provide him with books on different religions and comparative theology.  The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight.  Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment. Consumed by grief and "angry at the world" Sam turns his back on his past as a respected community volunteer.  He moves to [[Los Angeles]] and creates a new persona: "Snap" Wilson, a professional criminal, gang member, and pimp.<ref>Johns, Geoff. Avengers volume 3, #64</ref><ref>Priest, Christopher J. Captain America and the Falcon, #7</ref>

While "Snap" is on his way to "a big score in [[Rio de Janeiro]]", his plane crashes on Exile Island (years later, he would say "I actually loved this place quite a bit.  It's where I met my two best friends," referring to Captain America and Redwing)<ref>Priest, Christopher J. Captain America and the Falcon, #11</ref>.  The once-peaceful island had been taken over by the [[Exiles (Red Skull allies)|Exiles]], a group of would-be world conquerors who had collaborated with the [[Nazi]] [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]] during [[World War II]].  More recently, they had been betrayed by the Red Skull, and were forced to remain in hiding on the island, enslaving the natives.  Wilson finds and befriends '''Redwing''', a falcon which he feels a remarkably strong bond with.

===Becoming the Falcon===
The Red Skull uses the [[Cosmic Cube]], a creation that allows its user to alter reality, to mentally fuse Wilson with Redwing, creating a "super-normal mental link" that would, with time and concentration, give Wilson broad powers over all birds.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186 (June 1975).</ref><ref>Johns, Geoff. ''The Avengers'' #475 / vol. 3, #60 (Jan. 2003).</ref>  Next, the Skull uses the Cube to rewrite the past and remove the years Wilson had spent angrily living as "Snap".  In this new history, Wilson was an upright and cheerful [[social worker]] who is eventually lured to the Exiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom. Steve Rogers (Captain America) befriends him there and convinces Wilson to adopt a persona to inspire the natives in their rebellion. The two create the costumed persona the Falcon, and train together extensively before attacking and defeating the Exiles and the Red Skull.<ref name="Lee, Stan 1969"/>  The Falcon becomes Captain America's regular partner in crime-fighting,<ref>''Captain America'' #133</ref> and briefly even takes on the Captain America costume and identity when Rogers is believed to have been killed.<ref>''[[Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty]]'' #8-9 (April-May 1999)</ref> 

Later, again as the Falcon, Wilson receives help from the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], who creates a harness for Wilson, allowing him to fly.<ref>Englehart, Steve, and Mike Friedrich. ''Captain America'' #170 (Feb. 1974)</ref> When Rogers briefly abandons his Captain America identity, others attempt to take up the mantle, including a young man named Roscoe whom the Falcon mentors. When the Red Skull eventually kills Roscoe, Rogers again becomes Captain America.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #181-183 (Jan.-March 1975)</ref>

Soon afterward, the Red Skull reveals the Falcon's true past as "Snap" Wilson, and unsuccessfully attempts to use the Cosmic Cube to make the Falcon kill Captain America.<ref>Englehart, Steve, and John Warner. ''Captain America'' #186 (June 1975) </ref> Now aware of his past but deciding to continue as a hero, the Falcon is eventually named head of the Super Agents at the [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].<ref>Glut, Donald F. ''Captain America'' #218 (Feb. 1978)</ref>

===Avenger===
US government superhero liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] then recruits the Falcon, one of the few active African-American superheroes, to fill a mandated racial quota for the venerable team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #184 (June 1979)</ref> Resentful of being a "token", the Falcon quits at the first opportunity. He debuts a new costume when he fights the supervillain [[Taskmaster]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #11</ref>

Eventually, a new team of Avengers is assembled to fight the international menace [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]].  Afterwards, the United Nations offers to make this new team of Avengers an international peacekeeping agency.  Having been called on for his talent, and not for the color of his skin, Falcon decides to stay as a member of this Avengers team.  By this point, Falcon had discovered that he could extend his telepathic bond with Redwing, allowing him to control other birds and "see" through their eyes.  He uses this ability to spy on Henry Gyrich (now the Avengers' liaison with the United Nations) and discovers that the United States' Secretary of Defense, Senator Dell Rusk, has been pressuring Gyrich to spy on the Avengers and turn over their secrets.  Although initially hostile to one another, Falcon convinces Gyrich to help the Avengers spy on Rusk, feeding him false information while gathering evidence to expose him.  They discover that Rusk is actually the Red Skull, who has launched a biological weapon attack on America, intending to use the ensuing panic to gain control over America's government and start a war with other countries. Falcon is instrumental in defeating the Red Skull<ref>Johns, Geoff.  Avengers, Volume 3, #57-70</ref>.

It is around this period of time that, a new "Captain America" secretly created by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (O.N.I.) goes rogue and begins eliminating anything and anyone he sees as a source of terrorism.  To draw this agent (dubbed "The [[Anti-Cap]]") out, O.N.I. leaks information about their involvement in a [[biological weapons]] project with the notorious Rivas Family, powerful Cuban druglords.  Reporter and Social Activist Leila Taylor investigates this rumor and attempts to smuggle a sample of the virus into America, but she is arrested by U.S. forces in Cuba.  Falcon, who is a friend of Taylor, breaks her out of prison and investigates her claims, destroying the Rivas Family's biological weapons lab and obtaining a sample of the mysterious virus they were developing for O.N.I.  Falcon is able to fly Leila back to America (although his flying harness is destroyed in a hurricane) while Captain America follows Falcon's directions and retrieves the virus sample.  The Anti-Cap kills the head of the Rivas family, and pursues Leila, Falcon, and Cap, intent on obtaining the virus sample.  After reuniting, Falcon and Captain America are able to barely defeat the Anti-Cap.  Realizing that O.N.I.'s goal was to draw out their rogue agent to execute him, Captain America arranges to have the Anti-Cap be secretly imprisoned in the Wakandian embassy, until O.N.I. agrees not to kill him.

Since Captain America and Falcon now possess both O.N.I.'s rogue agent and the last remaining sample of O.N.I.'s virus, O.N.I. begins to put increasing amounts of pressure on the heroes. Falcon is especially targeted - he had broken Leila out of Federal Custody, and his criminal history makes it easier for O.N.I. to create further false charges against him.  Falcon soon finds himself on the run from O.N.I.

Meanwhile the superheroine the [[Scarlet Witch]], having gone insane, begins using her powers to recreate many of the Avengers' greatest trials and tragedies.  She destabilizes the Falcon's mind, causing him to act increasingly like his "Snap" persona.  He begins carrying a gun, keeps secrets from his friends, assaults Leela's boyfriend '''Norman''' when he protests they go into hiding, and uses a high power rifle to shoot at his friend [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]] (to fool Robbie into thinking O.N.I. was threatening to kill him).  Although they succeed in exposing the illegal activities of O.N.I. and clear Wilson's name, Sam's methods cause his relationship with Captain America to become strained.  Cap confronts Falcon about his recent actions, and Falcon, angered at what he sees as an "Ultimatum" terminates their partnership.  As they are walking away, Norman (who blames Falcon for the end of his relationship with Leila) appears and shoots at Falcon.  Captain America is seriously injured by the stray bullets, and even appears to die.  The shock of watching his best friend seemingly die because of his actions has a powerful affect on Sam, who briefly gives up being Falcon and reexamines his life. <ref>Priest, Christopher J. Captain America and the Falcon, #1-14</ref>

===Civil War/Initiative===
Sam Wilson reappeared as Falcon without explanation,<ref>''[[House of M]]'' #1, ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #12, ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref> and supports Captain America against the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. When the Captain becomes incapacitated, Falcon temporarily assumes leadership of the "Secret Avengers" rebel group.<ref>''Civil War #4''</ref>. Following Captain America's assassination by the machinations of the Red Skull, the Falcon registers with the government and is made responsible for Harlem, although he continues to be in contact with the underground [[New Avengers]].  Falcon is one of the pallbearers carrying Captain America's coffin, and gives an inspirational speech at the funeral.<ref>''Fallen Son: Death of Captain America''</ref> Afterward, S.H.I.E.L.D. recruits the Falcon and agent [[Sharon Carter]] to investigate the Captain's assassination by locating the [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]] and tracking down the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' vol.5, #31-33 (Dec. 2007-Feb. 2008), Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
===Powers===
In his earliest appearances Falcon exhibits a close bond with his bird Redwing, which in ''Captain America'' #174 [[Professor X]] confirms as being a paranormal empathic link.  The [[Red Skull]] later reveals that he had used the [[Cosmic Cube]] to create a "super-normal mental link" between Sam Wilson and Redwing.<ref>Englehart, Steve. ''Captain America'' #186.  Marvel Comics, 1975</ref>  Falcon later recalled the experience, stating "Hurt like ''hell''.  Being mentally ''fused'' with that falcon.  Able to ''see'' through ''his'' eyes."<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #60.  Marvel Comics, 2003</ref> 

Recently, Falcon revealed that he has been able to extend this empathic link.  "I'm always psychically connected with Redwing, but through concentration I've recently tapped into another ability -- I'm able to link-up with other birds. ... I have over six ''billion'' pairs of eyes in the United States alone."  He used this ability to quickly search New York City when the criminal [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] kidnapped two children<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #64.  Marvel Comics, 2003</ref>, as well as to spy on Senator Dell Rusk (actually the Red Skull in disguise) and Henry Peter Gyrich<ref>Johns, Geoff. ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #61-69.  Marvel Comics, 2003-2004</ref>.   He is also apparently able to access the memories of birds, and see things they had witnessed in the past (although birds have a different concept of the passage of time, which makes it difficult for him to know when any events they witnessed occurred).<ref>Brubaker, Ed. ''Captain America'' vol. 5 #35.  Marvel Comics, 2008</ref>  

[[Image:Falcon avengers 64.jpg|180px|thumb|Falcon attacking Scarecrow, accompanied by a large flock of birds. Art by [[Ivan Reis]].]] Falcon has shown some ability to apparently control birds, as shown when he enlisted their aid in attacking Scarecrow, and when (badly injured and manacled to a wall) he telepathically summoned a large number of different birds from the surrounding area to smash through a window and attack the Red Skull.

===Uniform and flight harness===
The Falcon's original wing harness featured detachable jet-powered glider wings made of lightweight titanium ribbing and Mylar. The wings were covered with wafer-thin solar power receptors that convert sunlight into electricity to power miniature high-speed electric turbine fans in his uniform and boots. The wings detached and reattached to his uniform cybernetically.  The harness was destroyed in ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'' #2 (2004). The uniform was made of synthetic stretch fabric lined with a steel-alloy mesh.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

After the original flying harness's destruction,<ref>Priest, Christopher ''Captain America and the Falcon #2'', Marvel Comics (2004)</ref> the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] supplied Falcon with a new costume and wings.  An emitter array on Falcon's back creates holographic "hard light" wings with a maximum wingspan of up to {{convert|50|ft|m}}.  Controlled by a cybernetic link, the wings can be instantly reconfigured into "dozens of different cruise configurations".  A "magnetic drive", in turn, provides the thrust needed to get Falcon airborne.  The emitter also possesses GPS Jamming Devices that prevent [[satellite]] tracking, while the hard-light wings interfere with infra-red tracking.  A [[Vibranium]] microweave was added to the costume itself, making Falcon resistant to small arms fire.<ref>Priest, Christopher ''Captain America and the Falcon #6'', Marvel Comics (2004)</ref>  The entire system is controlled mentally through cybernetic circuitry in the Falcon's mask.  The costume has in the past featured a hidden "talon," a cybernetically controlled grappling line built into the gauntlets of his costume which he uses to entangle opponents, hook objects, or for swinging and climbing when his wings are detached. The costume's visors come equipped with various capabilities, including infrared lenses, giving him the ability to see objects by their infrared signature at night, magnification capabilities, and remote imaging sensors that allow a full 360 degree of vision when activated. The cowl also has a wide band receiver and transmitter with an unspecified range. The suit was originally built by [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakandan]] scientists, with costume modifications by Desmond Burrell.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Abilities===
The Falcon is an excellent trainer of wild birds, and has been trained in gymnastics and hand-to-hand combat by Captain America.

Redwing is a highly trained hunting falcon who responds to the Falcon's verbal and mental commands and joins him in battle against his adversaries.

At one point, a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] chased him, believing him to be a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], but this was later debunked and the Sentinel is presumed to have been malfunctioning.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

==Other versions==

===Marvel Zombies===
Falcon appears as one of the zombified heroes in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe. Initially, he is among the many heroes summoned by Nick Fury to fight off the infection, but he winds up being infected.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Afterwards, in ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', he, along with other wing-laden characters ([[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]] and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]), attack [[Machine Man]] and [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] as soon as they arrive in this ravaged universe, but he and the others are quickly killed by Machine Man.<ref>"Marvel Comics 3" #3</ref>

===MC2===
In ''Amazing [[Spider-Girl]]'' #7, Falcon was revealed to be dead. However, the [[Ladyhawk]] twins wear attire similar to his first costume (before he got his wings).

===Ultimate Falcon===
[[Ultimate Marvel]]'s Samuel Wilson is an explorer, adventurer, and scientist who uses a backpack with high-tech folding wings to fly. Wilson first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Galactus trilogy#Ultimate Nightmare|Ultimate Nightmare]]'' and then worked on the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], demonstrating a high level of technological understanding. He is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. rather than an official member of [[the Ultimates]] or Reserves. Not much is known about the Ultimate version of Falcon, except that he appears to have an entirely different origin than the original Falcon, has served with or under General [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]].  Wilson was a member of the armed forces but retired to pursue scientific interests.  This version appears to be an accomplished combatant, especially when using the sharp edge of the metal wings he wears as a weapon. His wings are controlled through the help of [[nanotechnology]] with which he can communicate and which can also send and retrieve computer information. The wings are partially self-repairing, as referenced in ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]''.

Ultimate Falcon also appears in the second [[Ultimates]] annual, where he teams up with Captain America, and in the [[Ultimate Vision]] miniseries.

===''U. S. War Machine''===
In Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]] series ''[[War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Falcon appeared alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]; he and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] served as [[Captain America]]'s backup and wore no costumes, only being addressed by their real names. In this reality, [[Captain America]] was actually [[Bucky]] wearing the Captain's uniform as here the Captain had died in [[World War II]] in his stead.

===What If?===
In the 2006 comic ''[[What If? (comics)|What If Captain America had fought in the Civil War?]]'', the [[Earth-717]] version of Wilson was an orphan raised by a [[Shawnee]] [[medicine man]], and grew up to fight in the [[American Civil War]] as part of an Indian volunteer regiment. He performs a ritual to give Steven Rogers the power of We-Pi-Ahk, the Eagle Spirit, and has a red eagle painted on his chest for this ceremony. He is killed by [[Bucky Barnes|Colonel Barnes]], the White Skull.
