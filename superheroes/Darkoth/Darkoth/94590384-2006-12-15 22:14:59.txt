'''Darkoth''' (aka '''Darkoth the Death Demon''') is a [[fictional character]], [[supervillain]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' series 1 #142, (January 1974), and he was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Rich Buckler]].

==Fictional character biography==
Major Desmond Pitt of the United States Air Force, was from the (fictional) city of St. Louis, [[Montana]]. He had a degree in [[aeronautical engineering]] and was a friend of, then test pilot, [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]]. 

Later, Pitt discovered that agents of [[Doctor Doom]], had infiltrated a solar shuttle project he was assigned to. Pitt passed himself off as a willing accomplice in order to discover the extent of their infiltration into [[NASA]]. He was so convincing that Doom himself took an interest. 
However, due to the recent death of his wife, Pitt made an error of judgment, and was discovered to be a double agent. Doom's operatives had Desmond denounced as a traitor, and kidnapped.

Doom made an example of Desmond by using genetic surgery and mutagenic compounds to radically alter his body until he resembled a legendary [[Latveria|Latverian]] mountain demon and codenamed him ''Darkoth the Death Demon''. Doom wiped his memories, and implanted the hypnotic suggestion that Darkoth was really a demon that had been rescued from the Netherworld. Darkoth was then enhanced by [[Diablo (comics)|Diablo]] and fought both Doom and the Thing. Upon his memory's returned he became Doom's nemesis, and the Thing's ally.

Later, Darkoth was killed in a battle with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and ended up in [[Belasco]]'s Realm, the dimension known as Otherplace. There he fought Belasco's servant [[S'ym]] for possession of the [[Soulsword]]. Darkoth killed S'ym and took control over the Soulsword, thereby becoming the embodiment of Otherplace, which he transformed into a realm of peace.

==Powers==
