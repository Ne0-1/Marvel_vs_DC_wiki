'''Starlight''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Defenders'' # 35 (May 1976).

==Fictional character biography==
Tania Belinsky was born in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], in the former [[Soviet Union]].  Tania became a young neurosurgeon, though after her dissident father Andrei had been sent to Siberia, she adopted a costume and identity similar to the original [[Red Guardian]]'s, and fought crime and protected dissidents in an attempt to reform Soviet society.  She left the USSR at the request of [[Doctor Strange]] staying in America and joining the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  

Dr. Belinsky fell under the influence of Sergei Krylov, alias the "[[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]", a mad scientific genius who had become one of the most influential men behind the scenes of the Soviet government.  He used a [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster to transform Tania into his super-powered thrall with nuclear powers, currently called '''Starlight'''.  Since her mutation by the Presence, Tania continually emits harmful radiation which she can harness for a variety of effects, including superhuman strength and durability, flight, and energy blasts.  She and the Presence left Earth for a time, when their radiatio levels were too dangerous to remain on Earth.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #259</ref>

Tania remains under the influence of the Presence.
