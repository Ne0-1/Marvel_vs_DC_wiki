She and the Presence left Earth since their radiation levels were too dangerous for them to remain.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #259</ref> Tania and Sergei were eventually revealed to be laboratory subjects on one of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory worlds.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref> After regaining their freedom, Tania took the name '''Starlight''', and returned to Earth with the Presence and [[Jack of Hearts]].

Tania was last seen in the company of the Presence as his cosmic companion during his attempts to conquer Russia by mutating its citizens and armies into radioactive zombie-like beings. This included some of the Avengers, who fell under his power. He was defeated by Thor and Firebird, who proved immune to the transformations and Tania offered to restore all those who had been transformed to normal. She also revealed that she had come to genuinely love the Presence and felt that she would have no one else in her life if she left him.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Later Tania and the Presence aided the Avengers in battling [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} The Presence was planning to capitalize on the chaos Kang had sown on Earth by attempting to conquer Russia again once he was defeated, but Tania refused to allow it and threatened to desert him if he did so.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of [[mutation]] from [[cobalt]] [[radiation]], Tania has [[superhuman strength]], [[endurance|stamina]], and [[durability]].  She can generate nuclear [[energy]] for [[flight]] at [[supersonic]] speeds, and to project radiation blasts. Starlight gives off low levels of [[nuclear]] radiation at all times, putting [[normal]] human beings to associate with her for any length of [[time]] at risk.

Tania has a gifted [[intellect]], and is skilled at neurosurgery and medicine, with a PhD. in [[medicine]]. She also has extensive [[experience]] in hand-to-hand [[combat]].
