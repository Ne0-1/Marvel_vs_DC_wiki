'''Dreadnoughts''' are a type of [[fictional character|fictional]] [[robot]] found in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]].  They are frequently employed by [[villain]]ous organizations. Different forms of the robots are depicted by organizations such as [[HYDRA]] and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Dreadnought is a non-sentient robotic combat instrument originally created by the subversive organization HYDRA for use in various commando operations.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #154</ref> It was first used in an attempt to breach the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] and assassinate director [[Nick Fury]]. 

Later the design and specifications for it were sold to the criminal cartel, The [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], who built the Silver Dreadnought.<ref>''Iron Man'' #138</ref>

Some time later, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] designed a new version, the Dreadnought 2000, stored at Target Technologies in Rutherford, New Jersey.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26</ref>

A rebuild version was used years later during an attack to destroy London city, where the robot had to fight Union Jack.

==Powers and abilities==
The Dreadnought was designed by [[HYDRA]], and the Silver Dreadnought was built by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. Its robotic materials, design, and construction from a titanium steel alloy afford the Dreadnought superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes. It has limited artificial intelligence, and no capacity for self-motivated activity. It is programmed for hand-to-hand combat in the style of an American boxer and for combat uses of its built-in weapons sub-systems.

This original and Silver Dreadnought versions' gauntlets have [[flamethrower]] nozzles, capable of firing a hydrazine-liquid oxygen mix.  Its knuckles are studded with spikes which can be shot like rifle bullets.  From the modules mounted like ears, the Dreadnought generates a powerful electrical charge which conducts throughout its body's frame and through conducting material.  The Dreadnought has no capability for projecting this electricity, but is capable of electrifying by touch. The Dreadnought's optical imaging sensor eyes are gamma ray particle beam projectors which can irradiate a target. The Dreadnoughtâ€™s mouth is connected to a tank of refrigerated Freon gas which allows the Dreadnought a single-use attack of freezing breath.

The Dreadnought 2000 model, designed by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]], has gauntlet projectors firing high pressure jets of either water, liquid oxygen, acid, oil, powerful adhesive, anesthetic gas, and/or napalm, and/or beams capable of liquefying steel of solidifying gases in the air.  It also has the eight gunpowder-launched knuckle spikes, body-wide electrical field, gamma ray particle beam projectors in its optical imaging sensors, and refrigerated Freon gas dispenser in the "mouth" cavity of the previous models.
