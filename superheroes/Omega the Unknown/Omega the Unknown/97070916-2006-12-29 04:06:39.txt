'''Omega The Unknown''' was both an American [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] from 1976-1977 and the titular character of that comic book.  The series, written by [[Steve Gerber]] and Mary Skrenes and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]], ran for 10 issues before cancellation for low sales.  Despite its short run, it has remained as a [[cult classic]] due to its intriguing characters and unusual storytelling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/comics/features/omegatheunknownclassic/default.asp |title=Omega the Unknown Classic |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Latta |first=D.K. |authorlink=D.K.

==Plot Synopsis==
Unlike many other [[superhero]] titles, the main focus of ''Omega The Unknown'' wasn't on the super-powered man in the iconic costume and cape.  Instead the story largely dealt with an unusually mature 12 year old boy named James-Michael Starling.  Through the 10 issue run of this comic book it was made clear that there was a connection between the [[Speech disorder|mute]] Omega and the strangely analytical James-Michael, with most issues adding to the mysterious nature of their relationship.

In the premiere issue, the character of Omega was shown as the last surviving member of an unnamed [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] race.  He escaped the mechanical beings who had devastated his planet in a ship headed to Earth.  The story then cut to James-Michael waking up in bed having dreamed the events that had just occurred with Omega.  

In his waking world, James-Michael and his parents are moving to New York City from 'the mountains' so he can improve his socialization skills after years of home-schooling.  En route to New York the Starlings' car is driven off the road and both of James-Michael's parents are killed, but not before the boy discovers that both of them were [[robots]].  James-Michael collapses into a coma and awakens a month later in a private hospital exhibiting an eerie lack of emotional response to his parents' deaths.  The hospital is later attacked by one of the mechanical beings that had destroyed Omega's homeworld, and Omega himself appears to defend James-Michael.  The superhero and the android fight but the conflict ends when James-Michael himself destroys the alien mechanism with energy bursts from his hands (an effect used by Omega in James-Michael's dreams).

After this beginning, the story follows James-Michael's life as he is fostered to two young women, nurse Ruth Hart and her roommate, ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[freelance]] [[photographer]] Amber Grant, in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of New York City.  The series explores the problems he encounters in a strange new place, and his trials (and friendships) in a New York City public school.  Issues of racism and bullying are addressed, although the stories' focus is on how the reserved and detached James-Michael relates to the world around him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/05/trapped-in-a-%20friday-he-never-made/ |title=Trapped In A Friday He Never Made! |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Hatcher |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Hatcher |date=2006-08-05}}</ref>

Meanwhile Omega the Unknown becomes a superhero figure in New York City, fighting minor supervillains such as [[electro (comics)|Electro]] and [[Nitro]].  He tends to appear when James-Michael is in danger and some characters remark that his appearance is identical to what James-Michael would look like as a grown man.  As the series progresses Omega and James-Michael eventually meet and interact, although the nature of their relationship remains unclear.

Omega himself is killed in the 10th (and final) issue leaving the mysteries of the story unresolved.  In late 1979, writer [[Steven Grant]] brought the characters to a conclusion in two issues of [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]], at the end of which most of the original series characters were killed.  While Gerber seemed unhappy with Grant's conclusion,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2005/06/14/the-omega-flap/ |title=The ''Omega'' Flap |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Gerber |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Gerber |date=2005-06-14}}</ref> it nevertheless successfully tied up the loose ends of the comic series, and is considered "canon" by Marvel.

In 2005, [[Jonathan Lethem]] announced he would revive this character (in collaboration with artist [[Farel Dalrymple]]) in a new series sometime in early 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1056261,00.html |title=Meta-Hero Worship |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Winters |first=Rebecca |authorlink=Rebecca Winters |date=2005-05-01}}</ref>. Original co-creator [[Steve Gerber]] later expressed personal outrage over the use of the character without his participation, although he and Mary Skrenes have since discussed the project with Lethem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2168 |title=Into the Unknown |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Johnson |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Johnson |date=2005-06-14}}</ref>

Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] recently updated the series' status during in a Q&A session on [[Newsarama]].com by saying "Jonathan Lethem winning the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|Macarthur Grant]] put additional and unexpected demands on his time, so we’re trying to be accommodating to him so the project is running a bit behind schedule so I think it’s fair to say that we’ll be seeing it in 2007 at this point."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays51.html |title=Joe Fridays: Week 51 |accessdate=2006-12-24 |last=Quesada |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Quesada |date=2006-05-19}}</ref>
