'''Omega the Unknown''' was both an [[American comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] from 1976-1977 and the eponymous character of that comic book.  The series, written by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Mary Skrenes]] and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]], ran for 10 issues before cancellation for low sales.  Despite its short run, it has remained as a [[cult classic]] due to its intriguing characters and unusual storytelling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/comics/features/omegatheunknownclassic/default.asp |title=Omega the Unknown Classic |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Latta |first=D.K. |authorlink=D.K. Latta |date=2005-07-11}}</ref>

A 10-issue series revamping the character was published from 2007 to 2008, written by novelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] and illustrated by [[Farel Dalrymple]].

==Plot synopsis==
Unlike many other [[superhero]] titles, the main focus of ''Omega the Unknown'' is not on the super-powered person in an iconic costume and cape.  Instead the story largely deals with an unusually mature 12 year old boy named James-Michael Starling.  Through the 10 issue run of this comic book it is made clear that there is a connection between the laconic Omega and the strangely analytical James-Michael, with most issues adding to the mysterious nature of their relationship.

In the premiere issue, the character of Omega is shown as the last surviving member of an unnamed [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] race.  He escapes the mechanical beings who have devastated his planet in a ship headed to Earth.  The story then cuts to James-Michael waking up in bed having dreamed the events that just occurred with Omega.  

In his waking world, James-Michael and his parents are moving to [[New York City]] from the mountains so he can improve his socialization skills after years of home-schooling.  En route to New York the Starlings' car is driven off the road and both of James-Michael's parents are killed, but not before the boy discovers that both of them were [[robot]]s.  James-Michael collapses into a coma and awakens a month later in a private hospital exhibiting an eerie lack of emotional response to his parents' deaths.  The hospital is later attacked by one of the mechanical beings that destroyed Omega's home world, and Omega himself appears to defend James-Michael.  The superhero and the android fight but the conflict ends when James-Michael himself destroys the alien mechanism with energy bursts from his hands (an effect used by Omega in James-Michael's dreams).

After this beginning, the story follows James-Michael's life as he is fostered to two young women in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of New York City.  The series explores the problems he encounters in a strange new place, and his trials and friendships in a New York City public school.  Issues of racism and bullying are addressed, although the stories' focus is on how the reserved and detached James-Michael relates to the world around him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/05/trapped-in-a-%20friday-he-never-made/ |title=Trapped In A Friday He Never Made! |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Hatcher |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Hatcher |date=2006-08-05}}</ref>

Meanwhile Omega the Unknown becomes a superhero figure in New York City, tending to fight only second-string super-villains (though he did once confront the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]) with a variety of outcomes. Otherwise, Omega tends to appear when James-Michael is in danger and then takes a more proactive role.  As the series progresses Omega and James-Michael eventually meet and interact, although the nature of their relationship remains unclear.  

Omega himself is killed in the 10th (and final) issue, leaving the mysteries of the story unresolved.  In late 1979, writer [[Steven Grant]] brought the characters to a conclusion in two issues of ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'',<ref>''Defenders'' #76-77</ref> at the end of which most of the original series' characters were killed.  While Gerber seemed unhappy with Grant's conclusion,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/?p=77 |title=The ''Omega'' Flap |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Gerber |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Gerber |date=2005-06-14}}</ref> it nevertheless successfully tied up the loose ends of the comic series, and is considered "canon" by Marvel.

==Fictional character biography==
Omega the Unknown is a humanoid being of superhuman power bio-engineered by an extraterrestrial mechanoid race named the Protar, from the planet Protaris in the Regreb System in the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Protar, foreseeing its own extinction, decided to create an ideal race of true humanoids as their legacy to the cosmos.  Their penultimate model, later called Omega, was placed on the planet Skrenesk to learn. He commandeered a Protar starship and fled to Earth after inadvertently destroying the world on which he was placed.  The Earth was the home of the final "model" in his series, the artificially created boy James-Michael Starling, whom Omega sought to protect from the Protar.<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #1</ref>

While on Earth, Omega was employed for odd jobs by a New York City pawn-broker, and had a number of battles with local beings. He battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #2</ref> [[Electro (comics)#Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]],<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #3</ref> [[Blockbuster (Man-Brute)|Blockbuster]],<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #7</ref> and [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #8</ref> While later embroiled in a rematch with Blockbuster, the second [[Foolkiller#Greg Salinger|Foolkiller]] saved Omega's life by murdering Blockbuster.<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #9</ref>

Omega was finally shot dead in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Police while battling [[Ruby Thursday]]; the police thought Omega was assaulting Ruby.<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #10</ref> James-Michael Starling, who had inherited Omega's power, learned the true origin of himself and Omega but refused to accept the truth. He threatened to use the power of Earth's biosphere against the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. However, seeing the error of his decision, he committed suicide when he turned the power inward and self-destructed.<ref>''Defenders'' #77</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Omega was created through Protariana technology, and has superhuman strength. He has limited psychokinetic abilities, and has a psionic rapport with other Protar organic creations.

Omega was educated as a warrior on the planet Srenesk, trained in the fighting skills of a Srenesk warrior. The extraterrestrial Sreneskian endowed him with the ability to draw upon the psionic energy of the biosphere to project energy bolts from his hands and fly. Using biospheric energy beyond a certain level could result in global destruction, however.

In 2005, novelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] announced that he was planning to revive the character of Omega the Unknown, in collaboration with artist [[Farel Dalrymple]], in a ten-issue [[limited series]] to be published in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |last=Winters |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1056261,00.html |title=Meta-Hero Worship |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2006-12-23 }}</ref>  Lethem was a childhood fan of the first ''Omega'' series, and referenced the character in his 2003 novel ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]''.<ref name= "comr">{{cite web |last=Renaud |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11990 |title=Jonathan Lethem Enters the Unknown with 'Omega' |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2007-11-05 }}</ref>  When asked about Omega's appeal, Lethem stated,
{{cquote|When Marvel invited me into their vault of iconography, I simply leapt at the icon that resonated most deeply with me.  It didn't hurt that Omega had been laying in neglect for so long, I might have had trouble trying to utilize a character who'd been put through so many paces as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]], say. Omega seemed a resource of thwarted possibility, open to speculation, not plumbed-out.<ref name= "comr"/>}}

Lethem's announcement "received a great deal of media coverage" and resulted in the original series being released as a trade paperback, ''Omega The Unknown Classic''.<ref name= "ack">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Zack |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=121762 |title=Jonathan Lethem on Omega the Unknown |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=2007-07-20 |accessdate=2007-11-05 }}</ref> After hearing of Lethem's plans to revive Omega, the character's co-creator Steve Gerber expressed personal outrage over the use of the character without his participation, though he and Mary Skrenes later discussed the project with Lethem and admitted that he had "misjudged" him.<ref name= "omeg">{{cite web |authorlink=Rich Johnston |last=Johnson |first=Rich |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2168 |title=Into the Unknown |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2006-12-23 }}</ref>  In May 2006, Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] explained that the series had been delayed to 2007, saying that "winning the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|Macarthur Grant]] put additional and unexpected demands on [Lethem's] time."<ref>{{cite web |authorlink=Joe Quesada |last=Quesada |first=Joe |url=http://classic.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays51.html |title=Joe Fridays: Week 51 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=2006-05-19 |accessdate=2006-12-24 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
