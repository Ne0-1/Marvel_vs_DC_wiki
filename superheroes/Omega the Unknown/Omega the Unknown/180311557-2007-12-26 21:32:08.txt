'''Omega the Unknown''' was both an [[American comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] from 1976-1977 and the titular character of that comic book.  The series, written by [[Steve Gerber]] and Mary Skrenes and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]], ran for 10 issues before cancellation for low sales.  Despite its short run, it has remained as a [[cult classic]] due to its intriguing characters and unusual storytelling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/comics/features/omegatheunknownclassic/default.asp |title=Omega the Unknown Classic |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Latta |first=D.K. |authorlink=D.K. Latta |date=2005-07-11}}</ref>

A new 10-issue series revamping the character began in October 2007, written by novelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] and illustrated by [[Farel Dalrymple]].

==Plot synopsis==
Unlike many other [[superhero]] titles, the main focus of ''Omega the Unknown'' is not on the super-powered person in an iconic costume and cape.  Instead the story largely deals with an unusually mature 12 year old boy named James-Michael Starling.  Through the 10 issue run of this comic book it is made clear that there is a connection between the laconic Omega and the strangely analytical James-Michael, with most issues adding to the mysterious nature of their relationship.

In the premiere issue, the character of Omega is shown as the last surviving member of an unnamed [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] race.  He escapes the mechanical beings who have devastated his planet in a ship headed to Earth.  The story then cuts to James-Michael waking up in bed having dreamed the events that just occurred with Omega.  

In his waking world, James-Michael and his parents are moving to [[New York City]] from the mountains so he can improve his socialization skills after years of home-schooling.  En route to New York the Starlings' car is driven off the road and both of James-Michael's parents are killed, but not before the boy discovers that both of them were [[robot]]s.  James-Michael collapses into a coma and awakens a month later in a private hospital exhibiting an eerie lack of emotional response to his parents' deaths.  The hospital is later attacked by one of the mechanical beings that destroyed Omega's home world, and Omega himself appears to defend James-Michael.  The superhero and the android fight but the conflict ends when James-Michael himself destroys the alien mechanism with energy bursts from his hands (an effect used by Omega in James-Michael's dreams).

After this beginning, the story follows James-Michael's life as he is fostered to two young women, nurse Ruth Hart and her roommate, ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[freelance]] [[photographer]] Amber Grant, in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of New York City.  The series explores the problems he encounters in a strange new place, and his trials and friendships in a New York City public school.  Issues of racism and bullying are addressed, although the stories' focus is on how the reserved and detached James-Michael relates to the world around him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/05/trapped-in-a-%20friday-he-never-made/ |title=Trapped In A Friday He Never Made! |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Hatcher |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Hatcher |date=2006-08-05}}</ref>

Meanwhile Omega the Unknown becomes a superhero figure in New York City, fighting deliberately-chosen second-string super-villains such as [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] and [[Blockbuster (Man-Brute)|Blockbuster]] (a character who had only appeared once, years before, in a Lee/Kirby issue of [[Captain America]]).  Omega tends to appear when James-Michael is in danger and some characters remark that his appearance is identical to what James-Michael would look like as a grown man.  As the series progresses Omega and James-Michael eventually meet and interact, although the nature of their relationship remains unclear.  Blockbuster is something of a foil to Omega, resorting to thievery to support his own son.  He is soon, however, killed by a new person taking the costumed identity of the [[Foolkiller]]--Greg Salinger, former cellmate of [[Richard Rory]], Ruth's friend, whom she takes in after his release from prison.

Omega himself is killed in the 10th (and final) issue, leaving the mysteries of the story unresolved.  In late 1979, writer [[Steven Grant]] brought the characters to a conclusion in two issues of ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', at the end of which most of the original series' characters were killed.  While Gerber seemed unhappy with Grant's conclusion,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2005/06/14/the-omega-flap/ |title=The ''Omega'' Flap |accessdate=2006-12-23 |last=Gerber |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Gerber |date=2005-06-14}}</ref> it nevertheless successfully tied up the loose ends of the comic series, and is considered "canon" by Marvel.

==Fictional character biography==
Omega the Unknown is a humanoid being of superhuman power bio-engineered by an extraterrestrial mechanoid race from the planet Protaris named the Protar.  The Protar, foreseeing its own extinction, decided to create an ideal race of true humanoids as their legacy to the cosmos.  Their penultimate model, later called Omega, fled to Earth after inadvertently destroying the world on which he was placed.  The Earth was the home of the final "model" in his series, the artificially created boy James-Michael Starling.  Omega was finally shot dead in Las Vegas<ref>Omega the Unknown #10</ref>, and Starling, who had inherited Omega's power, committed suicide.<ref>Defenders #77</ref>

==2007 series==
In 2005, novelist [[Jonathan Lethem]] announced that he was planning to revive the character of Omega the Unknown, in collaboration with artist [[Farel Dalrymple]], in a ten-issue series to be published in 2006.<ref>Winters, Rebecca.

{{cquote|When Marvel invited me into their vault of iconography, I simply leapt at the icon that resonated most deeply with me.  It didn't hurt that Omega had been laying in neglect for so long, I might have had trouble trying to utilize a character who'd been put through so many paces as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]], say. Omega seemed a resource of thwarted possibility, open to speculation, not plumbed-out.<ref name= "comr"/>}}

Lethem's announcement "received a great deal of media coverage" and resulted in the reprinting of the 1970s series, which was published as ''Omega The Unknown Classic''.<ref name= "ack">Smith, Zack.

The first issue of the revamped ''Omega the Unknown'' was published in October 2007, and Marvel is planning to "put 10 issues out in 10 months [and] tell the whole story within a year from October."<ref name= "ack"/>  After the last issue is published, all ten issues will be collected and reprinted in a single volume.<ref>Lethem at a reading at [[Boston College]], 2007-03-20.</ref>
