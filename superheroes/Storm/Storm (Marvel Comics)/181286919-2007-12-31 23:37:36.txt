'''Storm''' is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Best known as a prominent leader of the [[X-Men]], she is the reigning queen of the fictional nation of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], a title held by marriage to fellow Marvel Comics superhero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. She also currently serves as a temporary replacement for the [[Invisible Woman]] in the [[Fantastic Four]]. She was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], and first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May 1975),<ref name="giantsizexmen1">''Giant Size X-Men #1'', 1975</ref> becoming one of the first black heroines and one of the most popular comic book characters.

==Publication history==
===Origin of Storm (1970s)===
[[Image:giantsize1.jpg|left|thumbnail|Cover to ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, 1975. Art by [[Gil Kane]] & [[Dave Cockrum]]. Storm is flying in the top right-hand corner.]]
Storm, a.k.a. Ororo Munroe first appeared in 1975 in the famous ''Giant Size X-Men #1'' comic, written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum. In this comic, Wein uses a battle against the living island [[Krakoa]] to replace the first-generation X-Men of the 1960s with new X-Men.<ref name="giantsizexmen1">''Giant Size X-Men #1'', 1975</ref> Storm was an amalgamation of several characters Cockrum intended to use for the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]''. In a 1999 interview, Cockrum said that the original black female of the Legion would have been called The Black Cat. According to him, she had Storm's costume but without the cape, and a cat-like haircut with tufts for ears. However, other female cat characters like [[Tigra]] had appeared, so Cockrum redesigned his new character, giving her white hair, the cape, and so created Storm. When colleagues remarked that Storm’s white hair made her look like a grandmother, he just said: “Trust me.”<ref>{{cite web

[[Chris Claremont]], who followed up Wein as the writer of the flagship title ''Uncanny X-Men'' in 1975, embraced Storm and started writing many notable X-Men stories, among them the ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'' and ''[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]'' arcs, which respectively served as base for the films ''[[X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand|X-Men 3]]''. In both arcs, Storm is written as a major supporting character. This was a harbinger of things to come, as Claremont stayed the main writer of that comic book for the next 16 years and consequentially wrote most of the publications containing Storm.

In ''Uncanny X-Men #102'' (December 1976), Claremont established Storm’s backstory. Ororo's mother, N'Dare, is the princess of a tribe in [[Kenya]] and the descendant of a long line of Africans with white hair, blue eyes, and a natural gift for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  N'Dare falls in love with and marries [[African American]] [[photographer|photojournalist]] David Munroe. They move to Harlem in uptown New York City, where she becomes pregnant with Ororo and bears her, and then to [[Egypt]] during the [[Suez Crisis]], where they are killed in a botched aircraft attack and leave six-year-old Ororo as an orphan. <!--Although the original version of this story stated that the bomb was dropped by a jet of the [[Israeli Air Force]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, later stories such as in ''Classic X-Men'' have revised the bombing first to an event of the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and then to an unnamed military conflict.-->  There, her violent [[claustrophobia]] is also established as a result of being buried under tons of rubble after that attack. She then becomes a skilled thief in [[Cairo]] under the benign Achmed el-Gibar and wanders into the [[Serengeti]] as a young woman. There, she is worshipped as a goddess before being recruited by [[Professor X]] for the X-Men.<ref name="uncannyxmen102">''Uncanny X-Men #102'', Dec. 1976</ref>

Claremont further fleshed out Storm’s backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men #117'' (January 1979). He retroactively added that [[Professor X]], who recruits her in ''Giant Size X-Men #1'' of 1975, had already met her as a child in Cairo. As Ororo grows up on the streets and becomes a proficient thief under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar, one of her most notable victims was Charles Francis Xavier, the later [[Professor X]]. He is able to use his mental powers to temporarily prevent her escape and recognizes the potential in her. However, when Xavier is attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk, the [[Shadow King]], the two men are preoccupied enough with their battle to allow the girl to escape. Both Xavier and the Shadow King recognize Storm as the young girl later.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #117'', Jan. 1979</ref>

===Punk revival (1980s)===
In the following issues, Claremont portrayed Storm as a serene, independent character. Although Storm was initially written having trouble adjusting to [[Western culture]], e.g. calling the obligation to cover herself up in a public bath "absurd,"<ref name="uncannyxmen109">''Uncanny X-Men #109'', Feb 1978</ref> she earns a lot of respect: in ''Uncanny X-Men #139'' (November 1980), Claremont established her as the leader of the X-Men,<ref name="uncannyxmen139">''Uncanny X-Men #139'', Nov. 1980</ref> a position she holds in various incarnations. Claremont also made Storm especially harbor motherly feelings for the youngest X-Man, 13-year old [[Kitty Pryde]]. In ''Marvel Team-Up #100'' (December 1980), Claremont wrote a short story in which he retroactively established that Storm, then 12 years old, saves a young [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] from racist thugs when they both are in [[Kenya]].<ref name="marvelteamup100">''Marvel Team-Up #100'', Dec. 1980</ref> This story would later become a base for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters.<ref name="cbrmarriage"> {{cite web

In ''X-Men Annual'' #5, the X-Men travel with the Fantastic Four to help [[Arkon]] the Imperion defeat lizard-like [[Badoon]] invaders who had taken over his kingdom.  Storm and Arkon share a kiss at the end of the issue, as she turns down his offer to make her his queen.   

In the early eighties, adventures of Storm written by Claremont included a [[space opera]] arc, in which the X-Men fight parasitic beings called the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]. Storm is infected with a Brood egg and contemplates suicide, but then experiences a last-minute save by the benign whale-like [[Acanti]] aliens.<ref name="uncannyxmen162166">''Uncanny X-Men #162-#166'', Sept. 1982-Feb. 1983</ref> In the following arc, Claremont further established Storm's character strength. He wrote a story in which Storm's fellow X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] is abducted by a rogue mutant group called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. The X-Men are hopelessly outnumbered, and Storm is rendered sick by the Morlock called [[Plague (comics)|Plague]]. Only one solution is left, namely if an X-Man defeats their leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] in a duel to the death. At first, Storm's colleague, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], wants to battle her, but Storm states she leads the X-Men and fights Callisto. Despite being violently sick, she defeats Callisto by impaling her through the heart and nearly kills her.<ref name="uncannyxmen169170">''Uncanny X-Men #169-170'', May-June 1983</ref>

[[Image:Storm-bigcostume2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men #223'', featuring Storm in her punk look. Art by Kerry Gammill.]]
In ''Uncanny X-Men #173'', October 1983, a notable move was made by changing Storm's costume and appearance. Writer Claremont and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] created a new look, abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants, and changing her former veil of white hair into a punk Mohawk.<ref name="uncannyxmen173">''Uncanny X-Men #173'', Oct. 1983</ref> In the story, Storm's outlook on life darkens after her struggles with the Brood. These changes alienate her from [[Kitty Pryde|Kitty]] for a time. Storm is influenced in this by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], a lover of Wolverine who becomes one of her dearest friends.  <!--Some fans believe the two were lovers, though given Marvel's policies of the time, this possibility was never more than implied.  (I know this, but this needs a source) --> To flesh out Storm’s love life, Claremont wrote an arc in which fellow mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] develops a mutant power neutralizing gun. The intended target is another X-Man, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who because of her criminal history and a recent encounter with some [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, is believed to be a terrorist. When the shady U.S. government operative [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] aims at Rogue, he accidentally hits Storm, taking away her powers. Forge saves Storm from death and takes her back to his home in [[Dallas, Texas]] to recover. With his help, she adjusts to life without her powers, and they slowly fall in love. Later, Storm overhears a phone conversation between Forge and Gyrich, and discovers Forge built the weapon that took her powers. She is heartbroken and leaves him.<ref name="uncannyxmen185186">''Uncanny X-Men #185-186'', 1984</ref> 

However, Claremont continued to write her as a strong character, letting a de-powered Storm win against [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] for the leadership of the X-Men in ''Uncanny X-Men #201'' (1986).<ref name="uncannyxmen201">''Uncanny X-Men #201'', 1986</ref> In the late eighties, Claremont wrote arcs in which Storm, again portrayed with a costume and hairstyle closer to her original, temporarily joins the shady [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] (1987),<ref name="newmutants51">''New Mutants (vol. 1) #51'', 1987</ref> is trapped in another dimension with Forge and regains her elemental powers,<ref name="uncannyxmen225227">''Uncanny X-Men #225-227'', Jan.-March 1988</ref> is captured by the evil cyborg [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]].<ref name="uncannyxmen248">''Uncanny X-Men #248'', Sept. 1989</ref> Although believed slain in that encounter, she resurfaced, having become amnesiac as a result of being physically regressed to childhood by Nanny. She is hunted by the evil telepath [[Shadow King]] and framed for murder,<ref name="uncannyxmen253257">''Uncanny X-Men #253-257'', Nov. 1989-Jan. 1990</ref> and finally returns to thieving before regaining her memories back.<ref name="uncannyxmen265267">''Uncanny X-Men #265-267'', Aug-Sept 1990</ref> In the following arc, ''[[The X-Tinction Agenda]],'' she is kidnapped to the mutant-exploiting fictional nation of [[Genosha]] and is temporarily transformed into a brainwashed mutate, but is in the end restored physically and mentally to her adult prime.<ref name="uncannyxmen270271">''Uncanny X-Men #270-271'', 1991</ref>

===Growth as a character (1990s)===
[[Image:Storm-Forge.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A panel from ''Uncanny X-Men #226'', featuring Storm and Forge in an intimate embrace. Art by Marc Silvestri.]]
In October 1991, the X-Men franchise was relaunched, centering on the new eponymous ''X-Men (vol. 2)'' comic. Claremont wrote Storm as the leader as the X-Men's Gold Team; the other team, Blue, is led by her colleague [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], the X-Man she once succeeded as leader. When Claremont left the X-Men comic after 16 years since his debut in ''Uncanny X-Men #94'' (1975),<ref>''X-Men (vol 2) #3'', Dec. 1991, was the last ''X-Men'' comic Chris Claremont wrote after 16 consecutive years</ref> he was replaced by [[Jim Lee]], who continued portraying her as a strong leader. In the sister title ''Uncanny X-Men'', now under [[Scott Lobdell]], Lobdell continued on the romance between Storm and Forge eventually having Forge propose to Storm in 1992. Storm hesitates and is about to say yes when Forge misinterprets her reaction and rescinds his offer before Storm can say yes.<ref name="uncannyxmen289290">''Uncanny X-Men #289-290'', June 1992</ref> Lobdell waited until November 1993 before he let a deeply hurt Storm and Forge make up with each other.<ref name="uncannyxmen306">''Uncanny X-Men #306'', Nov. 1993</ref> In 1995, Lobdell continued with an arc which pitted the X-Men against the Morlocks again. As Claremont did with Callisto in 1983, Lobdell let Storm end the battle by mortally wounding her opponent at the heart. This time, Storm rips out one heart of the two-hearted Morlock girl [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], who had fixed a bomb to it.<ref name="uncannyxmen325">''Uncanny X-Men #325'', Oct. 1995</ref> In February 1996, Storm got her first miniseries, the eponymous ''Storm.'' In these four issues, Ellis wrote a story in which Storm is sucked into an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] and pitted against villain [[Mikhail Rasputin]].<ref name="storm14">''Storm'' #1-4, Feb-May 1996</ref>

===Contemporary Storm (2000s)===
In ''[[X-Treme X-Men]],'' conceived by a newly-reinstated Chris Claremont in July 2001, Storm was written as the leader of this team of more street-wise X-Men, including the former thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], former [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] member [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], anti-hero [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]] and the more tame [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird]]. This was in contrast to its more straight-laced sister titles, ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''New X-Men.'' In the period until its end in issue #46 (June 2004), Claremont continued to write Storm as the central character. During this time, Storm enjoys a brief flirtation with younger fellow X-Man [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]] and is kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (comics)|Khan]]. Khan wants to make her his queen, but Storm defeats him. In the series, she also becomes leader of the fictional [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]], a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority.<ref name="xtremexmen146">''X-Treme X-Men'' #1-46, July 2001-June 2004</ref>

In the aftermath of the 2005 ''[[House of M]]'' storyline of [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Decimation (comics)|while 98% of the mutants lost their powers]] due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magicks, Storm is among the [[List of the 198|198]] mutants who retain their powers.<ref name="houseofm">''[[House of M]]'', 2005</ref> Also in that year, the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm'' of Mark Sumerak retold her backstory in greater detail, concentrating on her relationship with surrogate father figure Achmed el-Gibar during her childhood.<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14">''Ororo: Before the Storm #1-4'', Aug-Nov 2005</ref> 
[[Image:Stormbpmarriage.PNG|thumbnail|right|175px|The marriage of Storm and the Black Panther. Front cover for Black Panther #18 (2006), by Frank Cho.]] In the following year, Marvel Comics announced that Ororo would marry fellow African super hero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Collaborating writer [[Eric Jerome Dickey]] explained that it was a move to explicitly target the female and [[African American]] audience.<ref>{{cite web

Also, during the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' series, Storm and the Black Panther tried to help the Fantastic Four defeat the [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]], but were all beaten.

In ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'', Storm covers Nightcrawler when it came to attacking the Marauders.

Storm was one of the first black comic book characters, and the first black female, to play either a major or supporting role in the big two comic book houses, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. Within these two companies, her 1975 debut was only preceded by a few male black characters. In Marvel Comics, preceding characters were [[Gabe Jones]] (debuted in 1963), [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] (1966), [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] (1966), ''[[Spider-Man]]'' supporting characters [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|Joe Robertson]] (1967) and his son [[Randy Robertson|Randy]] (1968) and [[Prowler (comics)|Hobie Brown]], [[Luke Cage]] (1972), [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) and [[Sons of the Tiger|Abe Brown]] (1974). In DC Comics, she was preceded by ''[[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' member [[Mal Duncan]] who debuted in 1970, ''[[Green Lantern]]'' wielder [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] (1971) and [[Mister Miracle]] protégé [[Shilo Norman]] (1973), but she preceded DC's other black heroes, ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' member [[Tyroc]] (who debuted in 1976), and [[Black Lightning]] (who debuted in 1977).  While not the first black character to be introduced, since her creation, Storm has remained the most successful and recognizable black superhero.  In fact, Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] has referred to Storm as

{{cquote|one of the greatest female characters ever and certainly the greatest African character ever conceived.}}

==Fictional character biography==<!--STRICT adherence to WP:WAF!!-->
Ever since her inception in 1975, Storm's biography has largely stayed the same. The framework was laid first by Chris Claremont, who fleshed out her backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men #102'' (1976)<ref name="uncannyxmen102">''Uncanny X-Men #102'', Dec. 1976</ref> and ''Uncanny X-Men #117'' (1979).<ref name="uncannyxmen117">''Uncanny X-Men #117'', Jan. 1979</ref> Some reinterpretations were made in 2005 and 2006, where writers Mark Sumerak and Eric Jermone Dickey, respectively, rewrote part of her early history in the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm''<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14">''Ororo: Before the Storm #1-4'', Aug-Nov 2005, Marvel Comics, writer Mark Sumerak</ref> and ''Storm (vol. 2)''.<ref name="storm16">''Storm (vol. 2) #1-6'' miniseries, Apr-Nov 2006</ref>

According to established Marvel canon, Ororo Munroe is the child of Kenyan tribal princess N’Dare and African-American photographer David Munroe. While stationed in Egypt during the [[Suez Crisis]], a fighter jet crashes into her parents’ house, killing them. Buried under tons of rubble, Ororo survives but is [[orphan]]ed and left with intense [[claustrophobia]].<ref name="uncannyxmen102">''Uncanny X-Men #102'', Dec. 1976</ref> In [[Cairo]], she is picked up by the benign street lord Achmed el-Gibar and becomes a prolific thief;<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14">''Ororo: Before the Storm #1-4'', Aug-Nov 2005</ref> among her victims is her future mentor [[Professor X]] who is there to meet the [[Shadow King]]. <ref name="uncannyxmen117">''Uncanny X-Men #117'', Jan. 1979</ref>  Following an inner urge, she wanders into the [[Serengeti]] as a teenager and meets [[Black Panther (comics)|T’Challa]], her future husband.

==Powers and abilities==
===Weather manipulation===
Storm is one of the most powerful mutant heroes in the Marvel Universe.  Storm's character has shown a plethora of abilities most of which center on her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] power to control the weather.<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

Storm possesses the psionic ability to control all forms of [[weather]]. She can control the temperature of the environment, control all forms of precipitation, humidity and moisture, coalescence toxic atmospheric pollutants into [[acid rain]] or toxic fog, control the wind to elevate herself to fly at high altitudes and speeds, generate lightning and other electromagnetic atmospheric phenomena, and has demonstrated excellent control over [[atmospheric pressure]]. All forms of meteorological tempests are controllable by her, from [[tornadoes]] and [[thunderstorms]] to [[blizzards]] and [[hurricanes]]. Besides the atmosphere, Storm has demonstrated the ability to control natural forces that include cosmic storms, [[solar wind]], ocean currents and the electromagnetic field.  She can create electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields and has demonstrated the ability to create electrolytic fields to separate water molecules into molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen.  While in outer space, she is able to affect and manipulate the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. Storm can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe in terms of energy patterns, detecting the flow of the electromagnetic fields behind weather phenomena, machines, and nervous systems.

Storm has shown to be sensitive to the dynamics of the natural world.  One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather.  She has sensed a diseased and dying tree on the [[X-Mansion|X-Men mansion]] grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums--including water, sensed the in-correct motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet's magnetosphere.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #29</ref>

Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body.<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

===Magical potential===
Storm's ancestry supports the use of magic and witchcraft.<ref name="Tarot">''The Marvel Tarot'' Direct Edition One Shot, June 2007</ref>  Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses.  Storm's matrilenial powers have even been linked to the ''real-world'' [[Rain Queen]]s of Balobedu, the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor, Ayesha, hails from.  The [[Mystic Arcana]] series deals with Storm's ancestor Ashake, who worships the Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], also known as Oshtur--the mother of Agamotto.<ref>''Mystic Acana'' vol. 1 #1</ref>  Some of Storm's alternate universe forms possess considerable magical talent.<ref>{{Comic book reference
