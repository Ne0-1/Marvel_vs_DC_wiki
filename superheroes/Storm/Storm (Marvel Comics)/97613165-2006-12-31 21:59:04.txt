'''Storm''' (real name '''Ororo Munroe''') is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Formerly a prominent leader of the [[X-Men]], she is currently the reigning queen of [[Wakanda]], a title held by marriage to the king of Wakanda, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. She was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], and first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 ([[1975#May|May 1975]]), becoming one of the first black female superheroes.

Storm has the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] power to [[weather control|control the weather]] and can fly at high speeds. She was consistently a member of some X-Men battalion from [[1975]] on<!-- until [[2005]] (when did she leave?) -->, often serving as the team’s leader. She has been featured in almost every X-Men [[animated series]] and [[video game]] and has a theme ride named after her at the [[Universal Orlando Resort]]. Actress [[Halle Berry]] plays her in the [[X-Men film]]s.

==Publication history==
===1970s===

Storm, a.k.a. Ororo Munroe first appeared in [[1975]] in the famous ''Giant Size X-Men #1'' comic, written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum, in which a battle against the living island [[Krakoa]] is used to replace the all-[[WASP]], first-generation X-Men of the 1960s with a slew of international X-Men.<ref>''Giant Size X-Men #1'', 1975, Marvel Comics, writer Len Wein</ref>Storm was an amalgamation of several characters Cockrum intended to use for the ''[[Legion of Superheroes]]''. In an [[1999]] interview, Cockrum said:

{{cquote|The original black female in the group was to have been called The Black Cat. She had Storm's costume but without the cape, and a cat-like haircut with tufts for ears. [...A]ll of a sudden all of these other female cat characters had sprung up—[[Tigra]], The Cat, Pantha—so I figured that we'd better overhaul this one! She wound up getting white hair, the cape, and becoming Storm. [...] I wanted to put the white hair on her, everybody said that she'd wind up looking like somebody's grandmother. I said, "Trust me."<ref>{{cite web

[[Chris Claremont]], who followed up Wein as the writer of the flagship title ''Uncanny X-Men'' in [[1975]], embraced Storm and started writing many X-Men stories (most prominently the ''[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]''), with Storm as an important supporting character. This was a harbinger of things to come, as Claremont stayed the main writer of that comic book for the next 16 years and conseqentially wrote the most of the publications containing Storm.

In ''Uncanny X-Men #102'' ([[1976#December|December 1976]]), Claremont established her backstory. Ororo's mother, N'Dare, is the princess of a tribe in [[Kenya]] and the descendant of a long line of Africans with white hair, blue eyes and a natural gift for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], which Storm's Egyptian ancestor, Ashake, is expert in. N'Dare falls in love with and marries [[African American]] [[photographer|photojournalist]] David Munroe. They move to Harlem in uptown New York City, where they have Ororo, and then to [[Egypt]] during the [[Suez War]], where they are killed in a botched aircraft attack and leave six-year-old Ororo as an orphan. Although the original version of this story stated that the bomb was dropped by a jet of the [[Israeli Air Force]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, later stories have revised the bombing first to an event of the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and then to an unnamed military conflict.  There, her violent [[claustrophobia]] is also established, result of being buried under tons of rubble after that attack. She then becomes a skilled thief in [[Cairo]] under the benign Achmed el-Gibar, and wanders into the [[Serengeti]] as a young woman, where she is worshipped as a goddess before [[Professor X]] recruits her for the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #102'', December 1976, Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref>

Claremont further fleshed out her backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men #117'' ([[1979#January|January 1979]]), retroactively adding that [[Professor X]] (who had recruited her in ''Giant Size X-Men #1'' of 1975, see above) already meets her when she is a child street thief in Cairo.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #117'', [[1979#January|January 1979]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> As Ororo grew up on the streets and became a proficient thief under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar, one of her most notable victims was Charles Francis Xavier, the later [[Professor X]].  He used his mental powers to prevent her escape.  He also recognized the child to have a unique mind that would require further examination.  However, Xavier was attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk, the [[Shadow King]].  The two men were preoccupied enough with their battle to allow the girl to escape.  Both however would recall her later. In the following years, Claremont portrayed Storm as a serene, independent character. 

Although Storm initially is written having trouble adjusting to [[Western culture]], particularly the sort represented by her sometimes-vicious teammate [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], she finds a home and family among the X-Men such as telepath / telekinetic [[Jean Grey]] and steel-skinned [[Piotr Rasputin]] who become not only her best friends, but also a surrogate sister and brother. 

===1980s===
Claremont established Storm as the leader of the X-Men in ''Uncanny X-Men #139'' ([[November 1980]]),<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #139'', [[1980#November|November 1980]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> a position she has held in various incarnations ever since. He wrote Storm as a strong, independent character, who especially harbours motherly feelings for the youngest X-Man, 13-year old [[Kitty Pryde]]. In ''Marvel Team-Up #100'' ([[December 1980]]), Claremont wrote a short story in which he retroactively established that Storm, then 12 years old, saves a young [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] from racist thugs when they both are in [[Kenya]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up #100'', December 1980, Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> This story would later become a base for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters.<ref name="cbrmarriage"> {{cite web

In the early eighties, adventures of Storm written by Claremont included fighting the parasitic [[Aliens]]-inspired aliens called the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], in which Storm is infected with a Brood egg and contemplates suicide, but then experiences a last-minute save by the benign whale like [[Acanti]] aliens.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #162-#166'', [[September 1982]]-[[February 1983]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> Furthermore, in the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] story line of [[1983]], in ''Uncanny X-Men #170'' ([[June 1983]]), Storm fights super-strong master strategist mutant [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] for the leadership of the disfigured mutants, beats her by impaling her through the heart and almost kills her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #170'', [[June 1983]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref>

[[Image:Storm-bigcostume2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Storm in her punk look (''Uncanny X-Men #223'', art by Kerry Gammill.)]]
In ''Uncanny X-Men #173'', [[October 1983]], a notable move was made by changing Storm's outward appearance: writer Claremont and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] created a new look, abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants, and changing her former veil of white hair into a punk mohawk.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #173'', [[October 1983]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> In the story, Storm's outlook on life darkens after her struggles with the Brood. These changes alienated her from Shadowcat for a time.  Storm was influenced in this by a lover of Wolverine's, [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], who became one of her dearest friends; some fans believe the two were lovers, though given Marvel's policies of the time, this possibility was never more than implied.  Claremont further stirred up matters when he wrote an arc in which her soon-to-be romantic interest, [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], develops a mutant power neutralizing gun. The intended target is fellow X-Man [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who had been written by Claremont as a character with a criminal backstory. Therefore, she is still believed to be a terrorist, and in addition recently has attacked [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] agents. When the shady U.S. government operative [[Henry Gyrich]] aims at Rogue, he accidentally hits Storm, taking away her powers. Forge saves Storm from death and takes her back to his home in [[Dallas, Texas]] to recover. With his help, she adjusts to life without her powers, and they slowly fall in love. When she finds out Forge has built it (she accidentally overhears a phone conversation between Forge and Gyrich), she is heartbroken and leaves him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #185-186'', [[1984]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref>

However, Claremont wrote further arcs that established her character strength, most notably that power loss did not lead her to being a lesser fighter. In ''Uncanny X-Men #201'' (1986), he let depowered Storm win against [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] for the leadership of the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #201'', [[1986]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> 

In the late eighties, Claremont wrote arcs in which Storm temporarily joins the shady [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] (1987),<ref>''New Mutants (vol. 1) #51'', 1987, Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont''</ref> is trapped in another dimension with Forge and regains her elemental powers as well as her long hair,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #225-227'', January-[[March 1988]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> is captured and rendered amnesiac by the evil robot [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #248'', [[September 1989]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> is hunted by the evil telepath [[Shadow King]] and framed for murder,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #253-257'', [[November 1989]] - [[January 1990]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> and finally returns to thieving before regaining her memories back.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #265-267'', [[August 1990]] - [[September 1990]], Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> In one well-known arc, ''[[The X-Tinction Agenda]]'', she is kidnapped to the mutant-exploiting fictional nation of [[Genosha]] and is temporarily transformed into a brainwashed mutate, but then regains her memory.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #270-271'', 1991, Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref>

===1990s===
[[Image:Storm-Forge.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Storm and Forge. Art by Marc Silvestri.]]

In [[October 1991]], the X-Men franchise was relaunched, centering on the new adjectiveless ''X-Men (vol. 2)'' comic. Claremont wrote her as the leader as the X-Men's Gold Team (the other team, Blue, was led by Cyclops). When Claremont, left the X-Men comic after 16 years since his debut in ''Uncanny X-Men #94'' ([[1975]]),<ref>''X-Men (vol 2) #3'', December 1991, Marvel Comics, was the last ''X-Men'' comic Chris Claremont wrote after 16 consecutive years</ref> he was replaced by [[Jim Lee]], who continued portraying her in this fashion. In the sister title ''Uncanny X-Men'', now under [[Scott Lobdell]], Lobdell made Forge propose to Storm in [[1992]], but due to a misunderstanding, Lobdell made Forge rescind his offer before Storm could say yes.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #289-290'', [[June 1992]], Marvel Comics, writer Scott Lobdell</ref> Lobdell waited until [[November 1993]] before he made a deeply hurt Storm and Forge make up with each other.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #306'', November 1993, Marvel Comics, writer Scott Lobdell</ref>

In [[1995]], Lobdell then wrote an arc which pitted the X-Men against the Morlocks again. As with Callisto decades before, Lobell let Storm end the battle by again mortally wounding her opponent at the heart, this time ripping out the heart of the Morlock girl [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], who had fixed a bomb to it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #325'', [[October 1995]], Marvel Comics, writer Scott Lobdell</ref> Marrow would survive due to her second heart, and would later regret her actions, make up with Storm and join the X-Men.

In [[February 1996]], Storm got her first miniseries, the eponymous ''Storm #1-#4'' (writer [[Warren Ellis]], February - May 1996). In these four issues, Ellis wrote a story in whic Storm is sucked into an [[alternate dimension]] and pitted against villain [[Mikhail Rasputin]].<ref>''Storm #1-#4'', February - May 1996, Marvel Comics, writer [[Warren Ellis]]</ref>

===2000s===
[[Image:Uxm449.jpg|thumb|150px|left| Storm cover from Uncanny X-Men.]]
In ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' ([[July 2001]]), conceived by a newly-reinstated Chris Claremont, Storm was written the leader of this team of more street-wise X-Men (as opposed to its sister titles, ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''New X-Men'', which featured more straight-laced X-Men). In the period until its end in issue #46 ([[June 2004]]), Claremont continued to write her as the central character. Storm enjoys a brief flirtation with younger fellow X-Man [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]], and is kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (supervillain)|Khan]] who wants to make her his queen (she manages to defeat him). She also becomes leader of the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]], a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men #1-#46'', July 2001 - June 2004, Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[2005]] ''[[House of M]]'' storyline of [[Brian Michael Bendis]], due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magicks, [[decimation (comics)|98% of the mutants lost their powers]], but Storm did not lose hers.<ref>''[[House of M]]'', 2005, Marvel Comics, writer Brian Michael Bendis </ref>

In the [[2005]] Mark Sumerak miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm #1-#4'', her backstory (as a young child) with Achmed el-Gibar was retold in more detail.<ref>''Ororo: Before the Storm #1-#4'', August 2005 - November 2005, Marvel Comics, writer Mark Sumerak</ref> 
[[Image:Stormbpmarriage.PNG|right|The marriage of Storm and the Black Panther. Front cover for Black Panther #18 (2006), by Frank Cho.|thumb]]
In [[2006]], Marvel Comics announced that Ororo would marry fellow African super hero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Collaborating writer [[Eric Jerome Dickey]] explained that it was a move to explicitly target the female and [[African-American]] audience.<ref>{{cite web

Expanding on the relationship that Storm had with Black Panther, Dickey stated that Storm has had a romantic relationship with fellow African superhero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] when they were  teenagers.<ref>''Storm #1-#6'' miniseries, April - November 2006, Marvel Comics, writer [[Eric Jerome Dickey]]</ref>  Though the events of Storm's relationship with Black Panther were never written beforehand, the initial meeting of the characters was [[retcon|retconned]] without explanation. Initially, in ''[[Marvel Team-Up #100]]'', Storm is seen at age twelve rescuing Black Panther from [[Andreas de Ruyter]], but in Dickey's miniseries, a young T'Challa saves Storm (who is still twelve) from de Ruyter and his brother. A ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther #24]]'' flashback is ambiguous when it comes to the physical aspect of their first meeting, while the miniseries has Ororo lose her [[virgin|virginity]] to T'Challa a few days after they meet. Collaborating writer [[Axel Alonso]] (editor of ''Black Panther'') has stated: "Eric's story, for all intents and purposes (...) is Ororo's origin story."<ref name="cbrmarriage"> The relationship led to the marriage of the two most prominent black African Marvel Comics heroes in ''Black Panther #18'' by writer [[Reginald Hudlin]], [[July 2006]], as a tie-in to the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline.<ref>''Black Panther #18'', [[July 2006]], Marvel Comics, writer Reginald Hudlin</ref>. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] was highly supportive of this marriage, stating it was the Marvel Comics equivalent of the marriage of "[[Lady Diana]] and [[Prince Charles]]", and he expected both characters to emerge strengthened.<ref>{{cite web | last = Quesada | first = Joe | title = Joe's Friday 31, a weekly Q&A with Joe Quesada   | url=http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays31.html | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Quesada's prediction has begun to be born out in ''Black Panther'' story arc that followed Storm and T'Challa's wedding where the newly married couple go on a World Tour, meeting with other known royalties such as [[Doctor Doom]], [[Namor]], as well as the [[Black Bolt]] of the [[Inhumans]]. Solicitations from Marvel have confirmed that the Black Panther and Storm will choose a side in the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], and place their support behind [[Captain America]] and the Secret Avengers sometime in January of 2007.


Storm and Black Panther are to become members of the [[Fantastic Four]] alongside the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news  | last = Press Release - Marvel  | title = New Fantastic Four Revealed: Who joined?

==Historical significance==
{{main|African characters in comics}}

In historical perspective, Storm deserves mention because she became one of the first black superheroes in the big two comic book houses, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. Within these two companies, her [[1974]] debut was only preceded by a few male black characters. In Marvel Comics, preceding characters were [[Gabe Jones]] (debuted in [[1963]]), [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] ([[1966]]) and ''[[Spider-Man]]'' supporting characters [[Joe Robertson]] ([[1967]]) and [[Luke Cage]] ([[1972]]). In DC Comics, she was preceded by ''[[Teen Titans]]'' member [[Mal Duncan]] who debuted in [[1970]] and ''[[Green Lantern]]'' wielder [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] ([[1971]]), but she preceded DC's other black heroes, [[Tyroc]] who debuted in [[1976]], and [[Black Lightning]] who debuted in [[1977]].

Storm shares notable similarities with Lt. [[Uhura]] from the popular science fiction series ''[[Star Trek]]'', who first appeared nine years before in [[1966]]. Uhura is also a black female, has a similar name and is also written as a character with Kenyan origins. In an [[2003]] essay, [[PopMatters]] columnist Lynne D. Johnson regards them as the two prime examples of black female pop culture figures. In her text, she makes the point that despite best intentions, popular culture often depicts black women in a stereotyped way: either as a talented, but harmless entertainer (Uhura) or as a tough, highly attractive enforcer (Storm).<ref>{{cite web

In [[2006]], Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] called Storm "one of the greatest female characters ever and certainly the greatest African character ever conceived".<ref>{{cite web

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Storm.jpg|215px|left|thumb|Storm ''[[X-Treme X-Men]] #36'' cover, by [[Salvador Larroca]].]]
When [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Cockrum]] created Storm in [[1975]], they designed her as a [[mutant]] with the psionic ability to control the [[weather]], especially with the gift to summon her eponymous storms. When using her powers, artists have consistently depicted that her eyes illuminate a white color and [[aura]]. Storm has the power to control both space storms and ocean currents, in addition to her terestrial weather manipulating abilities. Her character displayed these abilities in various issues of [[Uncanny X-Men]].  She manipulated the solar wind to destroy a sentinel and summoned the power of a galactic core to purge her body of a [[brood (comics)|brood]] embryo that was implanted in her during a major story-arc in which the X-Men were in outerspace.

Storm has the ability to control [[wind]], [[lightning]], summon all manner of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], reduce or raise the temperature of her environment and fly at high speeds. Her powers also work the other way, enabling her to calm all weather precipitations. Storm has used her abilties to manipulate ocean currents and tides on several ocaisions.  Storm is also portrayed as highly immune to the effects of all weather, most notably lightning and extreme heat and cold, and she can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe as multi-colored energy patterns and the factors behind weather. Her abilities are limited by her willpower and strength of her body, and she cannot summon completely unnatural precipitations.<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

Ever since Chris Claremont established her backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men #102'' (December 1976), Storm is consistently portrayed as a skilled thief and a gifted hand-to-hand fighter. She is fluent in both [[Arabic]] and [[Swahili]]. Storm always carries with her a set of lock-picks and her ancestral ruby, which is capable of inter-dimensional transportation with the help of Ororo's lightning.<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

In addition, since the same ''Uncanny X-Men #102'' issue, Storm has been portrayed as being violently [[claustrophobic]]. Over the decades, writers have often used this as a plot device in order to trap Storm. Storm is also emotionally attuned to the weather and her surrounding natural environment; when she is very angry, it has been underlined by writers by having a storm brew up above her. Also she has been shown to sense when trees are diseased and dying.<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

Iron Man and the X-Men hinted at this, even comparing her to the world-devouring [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>''Black Panther #21'', 2006, Marvel Comics, writer Reginald Hudlin</ref>

===Ultimate Storm===
[[Image:Ultimatestorm.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Ultimate Storm, in a detail from the cover for Ultimate X-Men #8. Art by [[Andy Kubert]] and Richard Isanove.]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity of ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Joe Quesada]] in [[February 2001]], Storm, a.k.a. Ororo Munroe, is a founding member of the X-Men. In his stint until [[July 2003]], Millar created a much more belligerent version of Storm, establishing she was an illegal immigrant from [[Morocco]] who steals cars for a living and is located in [[Harlem]] before joining the X-Men. She was also written as much less powerful: at first, she is hardly able to summon more than a lightning bolt before passing out,<ref>''Ultimate X-Men #1'', February 2001, Marvel Comics, writer Mark Millar</ref> and still has to learn to control her powers. Her main departure from mainstream Storm is her attraction to fellow X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], an ape-like mutant whom she loves for his intelligence. However, Millar wrote this as a troubled romance, as Beast (written as a character with a deep [[inferiority complex]] after a lifetime of ridicule) can not believe anyone could truly love him. When later writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] killed Beast off in April 2004,<ref>''Ultimate X-Men #44'', [[April 2004]], Marvel Comics, writer Brian Michael Bendis</ref> Bendis let a grief-stricken Storm drastically alter her hairstyle and clothing to distance herself from her time with Beast, alluding to her mohawk hairstyle change in the mainstream version.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men #46'', [[June 2004]], Marvel Comics, writer Brian Michael Bendis</ref>

Subsequent writer [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote Storm to become more predisposed to act as the team's conscience, and letting her start a romance with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. In the ''Ultimate X-Men: Shock and Awe'' arc ([[2005]]), he inserted new elements into her backstory by establishing [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Lady Deathstrike|Yuriko "Yuri" Oyama]] as Storm's archenemy. In this version, Yuriko is written as a fellow thief when Storm is still a teenage thief, and their friendship ends in a motorcycle chase which Ororo halts with a sudden rainstorm; Yuri loses control, has a seemingly fatal collision with a truck and is rebuilt into a cyborg by amoral Dr. Cornelius of the mutant superweapon project [[Weapon X]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men: Shock and Awe'' arc, [[2005]], Marvel Comics, writer Brian K. Vaughan</ref>

Current writer [[Robert Kirkman]] has continued establishing a Storm - Wolverine friendship in ''Ultimate X-Men: Date Night'' ([[2006]]).
