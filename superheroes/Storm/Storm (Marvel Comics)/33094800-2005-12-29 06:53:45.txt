'''Storm''' (Ororo Munroe) is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] and a prominent member of the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May 1975).  

Storm has the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] power to [[weather control |control the weather]], including [[lightning]],  [[rain]], [[snow]] and [[wind]], which she primarily uses to make herself and others fly and she has the power of meteorkinesis.

Having debuted at a time when memories of [[Star Trek]]'s [[Lt. Uhura]] were still fresh, Storm's status as a black female with a similar name and Kenyan origins may not be coincidental. In any case, she may well be the first black female superhero of any note and remains the most popular.

==Character history==
<!-- I'm not sure her early years are accurately reflected here. -->
===Early life===
Ororo's mother, N'Dare, was the princess of a tribe in [[Kenya]] and the descendant of a long line of [[Africa]]ns with white hair, blue eyes and a natural gift for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], although Storm herself has not developed this talent. N'Dare fell in love with and married [[African American]] [[photographer|photojournalist]] David Munroe.

Ororo was born in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. When Ororo was six months old, she and her parents moved to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].  

Five years later, a [[bomb]] destroyed their home and killed Ororo's parents; although the original version of this story stated that the bomb was dropped by a jet of the [[Israeli Air Force]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, later stories have revised the bombing first to an event of the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and then to an unnamed military conflict.  Ororo was trapped in the collapsed building alongside her dead mother, a [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic experience that would ultimately leave her with a severe case of [[claustrophobia]].

The [[orphan]] Ororo grew up on the streets and became a proficient [[thief]] under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar. To this day she is an excellent pickpocket and lockpick.

One of her most notable victims was Charles Francis Xavier, the later [[Professor X]]. He used his mental powers to prevent her escape. He also recognized the child to have a unique mind that would require further examination. However Xavier was attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk, the [[Shadow King]]. The two men were preoccupied enough with their battle to allow the girl to escape. Both however would recall her later. 

Shortly after her twelfth birthday, Ororo felt something drawing her to the south of Africa. She left Cairo by foot and started traveling. She soon attempted [[hitchhiking]]. However, the first man who offered her a ride soon attempted to [[rape]] her. But the young thief had learned self protection from Achmed el-Gibar. She used her [[knife]] to protect herself and killed the man in [[self-defense]]. She was though horrified by her act and swore to never take another human life. Ororo would reconsider that [[oath]] in adult life.

Ororo continued her solitary trek for a year. She nearly died from [[dehydration]] while crossing the [[Sahara]]. Her journey brought about 2000 miles south of Cairo. During the journey, new powers emerged within her. Ororo proved to be a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the power to control the [[weather]].  

Those powers would prove useful in her first [[hero]]ic battle. Ororo witnessed Andreas de Ruyter and men of the [[South African Army]] in the process of [[kidnapping]] a young boy, slightly older than her. Ororo saved the boy and learned his identity. He was Prince T'Challa of [[Wakanda (Marvel Comics)|Wakanda]]. The [[South African]]s would have used their [[hostage]] to [[blackmail]] his father T'Chaka, the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. The two youths continued their journey together and fell in love. However they soon had to part ways. Storm wanted to continue her journey of self-discovery. T'Challa felt bound by duty to return to Wakanda and train to succeed his father. T'Challa would grow to became the next Black Panther and join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The two would remain friends in adult life.

Storm's journey next brought her to the [[Kenya]]n portion of [[Serengeti]], the land of her ancestors. Southern Serengeti is territory of [[Tanzania]]. There Ororo called out to the [[Goddess]] of her ancestors and was rewarded with a bright [[Vision (religion)|Vision]] of a woman resembling Storm in adult life. Storm would continue to swear by the Goddess but no name has ever been given to this [[deity]]. Current speculation is that this Goddess is [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] who has made multiple appearances in the [[Marvel Universe]] as the ultimate maternal ancestor of its various gods, for example [[Thor (Marvel Comics) |Thor]]. 

Ororo came to use her powers to help the native tribes and their efforts in [[agriculture]]. She came to be worshipped by them as their "Goddess of life", possibly the same deity Ororo had contacted in her vision. However her powers came with a price. The weather Ororo controlled was also [[Unconscious mind|subconsiously]] affected by her emotional state. Ororo had to detach herself from stronger, violent emotions in order to prevent the fury of the elements to bring ruin to those close to her. Ororo spend years exploring her powers with the help of Ainet, a tribal elder who came to serve as the surrogate mother of the youthful goddess.

===X-Men===
Ororo reached her maturity while still in the role of a tribal goddess. There she was found by her old victim [[Professor X|Charles Francis Xavier]], who invited her to join his second team of X-Men. Their first mission involved rescuing the original X-Men from the mutant [[ecosystem]] inhabiting the [[Pacific Islands|Pacific island]] of Krakoa. Storm was able to combine her powers with those of Cyclops, Havok and Polaris and send the entire island to [[outer space]]. 

Although Storm initially had trouble adjusting to [[Western culture]], particularly the sort represented by her sometimes-vicious teammate [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Storm found a home and family among the X-Men.  More over, she revealed herself to be a capable leader and became leader of the X-Men when its longtime leader, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], married and left the group. When the young [[Shadowcat]] joined the X-Men, Storm formed a very close, almost maternal bond with her.

Around this time, the X-Men spent a long time in space battling the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], an alien race. Spending so much time away from planet Earth severed the deep psychic connection Storm had with her home planet, prompting a period of much soul searching. Storm went through some profound personal changes because of this inner conflict, which resulted in her becoming more aggressive and violent. This led to her cutting her hair in a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and wearing [[leather]] clothing - changes alienated her from Shadowcat for a time. Storm was influenced in this by a lover of Wolverine's, [[Yukio]], who became one of her dearest friends; some fans believe the two were lovers, though given Marvel's homophobic policies of the time this possibility was never more than implied. She also fought [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] for leadership of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] and won by stabbing Callisto in the heart. Callisto only managed to survive due to the healing powers of another Morlock. The two remained enemies for awhile, but eventually managed to make up and are now friends. Storm now trusts Callisto enough that she asked Callisto to look after Xavier while he was in [[Genosha]].

===Romance===
[[Image:Storm-Forge.JPG|thumb|150px|Storm and Forge. Art by Marc Silvestri.]]
Storm lost her powers as a result from a neutralizer gun Forge had created to disable Rogue.  She also had an on-again, off-again romance with the mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]. She first broke up with him when she discovered that the neutralizer gun used to erase her powers was created by him, though she later forgave him.   In the battle with the Adversary in Dallas, Storm emerged with her powers fully restored to help he team mates defeat the Adversary but only to be sent through the Seige Perilous to later emerge in Australia.  While in Australia, she was transformed into a child by [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]] and being amnesiac returned to [[thievery]]. During which she met [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. After regaining her memory, she brought him to the team and was restored to her adult state later in Genosha.

Once the X-Men and X-Factor combined forces and split into the Blue and Gold teams, Forge proposed to Storm, but got cold feet and backed out before she could accept, leaving her distraught and in tears.

In the alternate future depicted in [[What If II#114|What If II #114]] Ororo married and had a daughter with fellow X-Man [[Wolverine]] and named her [[Kendall Logan]]. This daughter became the hero known as [[Torrent]], having some of her mother's control over weather as well as her father's feral abilities.

===Leader of the XSE===
Storm later led a group of X-Men outside of the mansion in the search for [[Destiny (Marvel Comics)|Destiny]]'s [[diary|diaries]], the Books of Truth.  On this search, she enjoyed a brief flirtation with a younger man, [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]] and was kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (supervillain)|Khan]] who wanted to make her his queen. Despite being badly injured, shot by Viper prior to being captured and having to fight off Khan's harem, she managed to defeat Khan with the aid of the X-Treme X-Men who came to rescue her.  They brought her back to Earth where she spent time recovering with the aid of Wolverine. 
 
Storm continued to lead the group even after Destiny's diaries were rendered inert because she did not approve of the way Xavier was running the mansion. The group returned to help rebuild the Xavier Institute after the mansion was destroyed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. From the school, Storm headed the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]], a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority.

When the X-Men journeyed to Niganda to investigate reports of mutant animals, they ran into Black Panther. At the end of the mission, Storm decided to remain in Niganda. 

Due to the Scarlet Witch's magicks, [[decimation (comics)|98% of the mutants lost their powers]]. Storm stayed in Niganda to help the mutants affected there. This change is apparently going to make her a more prominent member of the Marvel Universe according to recent interviews.

==Powers and abilities==
Ororo is a mutant with the psionic ability to manipulate the weather within roughly a mile proximity of her person. With great concentration, she could expand her ability over much greater areas, even a large portion of the coast of the continental United States.  Along with concentration, hand gestures usually accompany thoughts, but are not necessary. When controlling weather elements, her eyes illuminate a white color and aura. She can manifest any degree of wind, lightning, storms including lightning, all manner of precipitation, tornado-like cyclones and small hurricanes. Storm actually has the ability to affect the weather on a global scale but does not do this as she is very environmentally conscious. 

She was once thought to be immune to the effects of weather but Charles Xavier revealed that her body simply changed to compensate for the extremes she engineered; i.e. her body temperature would rise as she caused her surroundings to become cold.  She has the ability to project, focus and aim force blasts of extreme electrical bolts from her hands or sky using her elemental powers. At times, she has been able to use her ability to manipulate wind in a manner that resembles telekinesis, lifting massive objects and hurling them against opponents. This is frequently used to lift and propel herself through the air, giving her flight and levitation. She has even been known to stop projectiles such as bullets from hitting by using her ability to manipulate the wind. She is one of the most powerful members of the X-Men.

Aside from the abilities granted by her mutation, Ororo is highly intelligent and an able strategist and field commander of the X-Men.  Although not a criminal, her days as a thief have given her mastery of skills normally used by professional thieves, such as stealth, breaking into heavilly fortified areas and picking locks. She is also an excellent combatant in both armed and unarmed combat, having been instructed by Wolverine.

==Ultimate Storm==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Storm has been re-imagined as an illegal immigrant from [[North Africa]] who settled in [[Harlem]]. She made a living stealing cars before joining the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. She was much more belligerent and angry than her inscrutable mainstream version and was the long-time girlfriend of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Though, after his death, Storm enjoyed some flirtation and a single kiss with another teammate, Wolverine.

Storm has recently met Deathstrike,a rival from the past who has joined Weapon X.
One of the most powerful mutants on earth and a part of the X-Men gold team.

==Appearances in other media==
[[Image:Storm3.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Halle Berry]] as Storm]]
*Storm, originally voiced by [[Iona Morris]] in Season 1 and then [[Alison Sealy-Smith]] for all subsequent seasons, was featured in the ''[[X-Men animated series|X-Men]]'' animated series of the mid-1990s.  Storm also guest starred in the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]] in the 90's in Parts 2 and 3 of the Secret Wars arc.  In the Spider-Man series, Storm was once again voiced by [[Iona Morris]] because it is recorded in Los Angeles, where Iona Morris is now based whearas the X-Men animated series was recorded in Canada and it would have proved to costly to get the Canadian voice actress back.

*In the [[animated series]], ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Storm was portrayed as a teacher at Professor X's Xavier Institute and was voiced by [[Kristen Williamson]]. Storm is an American who was orphaned in Cairo after her parents were killed during an earthquake. Abandoned by fate, she wandered around the Middle East, surviving as a child-thief until her powers manifested themselves, until the day that Professor X discovered her serving as a goddess for an African tribe who believed her to be an Elemental Spirit. Professor X returned her to the States, where she learned to fully manifest her powers and help train other mutants like herself. Storm's powers tie her to all things natural; she has empathy/affinity for the Earth and all things natural. Her room is filled with plants, which she waters by using her powers to make it rain indoors. Because allowing her powers to run free could cause untold damage, Storm must keep her emotions in check. She is therefore outwardly serene. If she were to lose control of her emotions, all manner of weather-related catastrophes could happen. One of the few things that can make Storm lose her cool is her claustrophobia. The earthquake that left her an orphan also left her buried under rubble for days when she was four-years old. She was left with numbing claustrophobia. She is the aunt of the X-Man, Evan Daniels aka[[Spyke]].

*Along with [[Doctor Doom]], [[The Hulk]], [[Kingpin]] and [[Spider-Man]], Storm also has a ride in Marvel Super Hero Island of [[Universal Studios]]. A common teacup ride found in most themeparks with theming, "Storm Force Acceleration" also includes strobe lights which can be seen if ridden after dark.  She is the first superheroine to have a ride named after her on Marvel Super Hero Island or anywhere else for that case.

*She is played by [[Halle Berry]] in the movies ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000), ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003) and  ''[[X-Men 3 (film)|X-Men 3]]'' (2006). Despite a high-profile actress like Berry in the role, in the first two movies, Storm received little screen time and took a backseat to characters such as [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Due to her little screen time though, Halle Berry complained and as a result the role was enhanced for her in X-Men 3. The third installment is set to be released on May 26, 2006.

*Storm also has notably appeared in most of the X-Men video games that have been released on various consoles. The most noticeable ones are [[Marvel vs. Capcom series]], [[X-Men Legends]] for various game systems and the [[X-Men Mutant Academy]] games for the [[Sony PlayStation]].  She is particularly popular in [[Marvel vs. Capcom 2]] as part of the rushdown-oriented tournament team of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]/Storm/[[Psylocke]] (MSP).
