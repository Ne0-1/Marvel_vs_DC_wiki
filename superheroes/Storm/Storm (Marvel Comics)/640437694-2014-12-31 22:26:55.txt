==Publication history==

===Origin of Storm (1970s)===
[[Image:giantsize1.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Cover to ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, 1975.  Art by [[Gil Kane]] & [[Dave Cockrum]].]]
Storm first appeared in 1975 in the comic book ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum.  In this comic, Wein uses a battle against the living island [[Krakoa]] to replace the first-generation X-Men of the 1960s with new X-Men.<ref name="giantsizexmen1">''Giant Size X-Men'' #1, 1975</ref>  Storm was an amalgamation of two characters Cockrum created: The Black Cat and Typhoon.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 50–52}}</ref> The Black Cat had Storm's costume, minus the cape, and was submitted for the new X-Men's original lineup. However, during a hiatus in the new X-Men project, other female cat characters like [[Tigra]] were introduced, making the Black Cat redundant.<ref name="MarvelDays"/> Since the creative team did not want the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group.<ref name="TyphoonDave"/> Cockrum liked the idea, and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm’s white hair would make her look like a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.<ref name="TyphoonDave"/><ref name="MarvelDays">{{cite web| last = Cooke| first = John B.| title = The Marvel Days of the Co-Creator of the New X-Men| url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06cockrum.html| accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

[[Chris Claremont]] followed up Wein as the writer of the flagship title ''Uncanny X-Men'' in 1975, writing many notable X-Men stories, among them ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'' and ''[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]'', which respectively served as the basis for the films ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. In both arcs, Storm is written as a major supporting character. Claremont stayed the main writer of ''X-Men'' for the next 16 years and consequently wrote most of the publications containing Storm.

===Backstory===
In ''Uncanny X-Men #102'' (December 1976), Claremont established Storm's backstory.  Ororo's mother, N'Dare, was the princess of a tribe in [[Kenya]] and descended from a long line of African witch-priestesses with white hair, blue eyes, and a natural gift for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  N'Dare falls in love with and marries [[United States|American]] [[photographer|photojournalist]] David Munroe.  They move to [[Harlem]] in uptown [[New York City]], where Ororo is born. They later moved to [[Egypt]] and lived there until they die during the [[Suez Crisis]] in a botched aircraft attack, leaving six-year-old Ororo as an orphan. <!--Although the original version of this story stated that the bomb was dropped by a jet of the [[Israeli Air Force]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, later stories such as in ''Classic X-Men'' have revised the bombing first to an event of the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and then to an unnamed military conflict.-->   Her violent [[claustrophobia]] is established as a result of being buried under tons of rubble after that attack.  She becomes a skilled thief in [[Cairo]] under the benign Achmed el-Gibar and wanders into the [[Serengeti]] as a young woman.  She is worshipped as a goddess when her powers appear before being recruited by [[Professor X]] for the X-Men.<ref name="uncannyxmen102">''Uncanny X-Men'' #102, Dec. 1976</ref>

Claremont further fleshed out Storm’s backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #117 (January 1979). He retroactively added that Professor X, who recruits her in ''Giant Size X-Men'' #1 of 1975, had already met her as a child in Cairo.  As Ororo grows up on the streets and becomes a proficient thief under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar, one of her most notable victims was Charles Francis Xavier, later Professor X.  He is able to use his mental powers to temporarily prevent her escape and recognizes the potential in her.  However, when Xavier is attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk, the [[Shadow King]], the two men are preoccupied enough with their battle to allow the girl to escape.  Both Xavier and the Shadow King recognize Storm as the young girl later.<ref name="uncannyxmen117"/>

===Punk revival (1980s)===
In the following issues, Claremont portrayed Storm as a serene, independent character. Although Storm was initially written having trouble adjusting to [[Western culture]], e.g. calling the obligation to cover herself up in a public bath "absurd,"<ref name="uncannyxmen109">''Uncanny X-Men'' #109, Feb 1978</ref> she earns a lot of respect: in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #139 (November 1980), Claremont established her as the leader of the X-Men after Cyclops took a leave of absence,<ref name="uncannyxmen139">''Uncanny X-Men'' #139, Nov. 1980</ref> a position she holds in various incarnations.  Claremont also made Storm especially harbor motherly feelings for the youngest X-Man, 13-year old [[Kitty Pryde]].  In ''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (December 1980), Claremont wrote a short story in which he retroactively established that Storm, then 12 years old, saves a young [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] from racist thugs when they both are in [[Kenya]].<ref name="marvelteamup100">''Marvel Team-Up'' #100, Dec. 1980</ref>  This story would later become a base for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters.<ref name="cbrmarriage">{{cite web| last = Weiland| first = Jonah| title = Hudlin & Dickey talk Black Panther/Storm Wedding| url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6522| accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

In ''X-Men Annual'' #5, the X-Men travel with the Fantastic Four to help [[Arkon]] the Imperion defeat lizard-like [[Badoon]] invaders who had taken over his kingdom.  Storm and Arkon share a kiss at the end of the issue, as she turns down his offer to make her his queen.

In the early eighties, adventures of Storm written by Claremont included a [[space opera]] arc, in which the X-Men fight parasitic beings called the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].  Storm is infected with a Brood egg and contemplates suicide, but then experiences a last-minute save by the benign whale-like [[Acanti]] aliens.<ref name="uncannyxmen162166">''Uncanny X-Men'' #162-#166, Sept. 1982-Feb. 1983</ref>  In the following arc, Claremont further established Storm's character strength.  He wrote a story in which Storm's fellow X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] is abducted by a rogue [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] group called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].  The X-Men are hopelessly outnumbered, and Storm is rendered sick by the Morlock called [[Plague (comics)|Plague]].  To save Kitty's life, Storm challenges the Morlocks' leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], in a duel to the death for leadership of the Morlocks.  Despite being violently sick, she defeats Callisto by impaling her with a knife and nearly kills her.<ref name="uncannyxmen169170">''Uncanny X-Men'' #169-170, May–June 1983</ref>

[[Image:Storm22.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Storm's debut in her punk look and attitude. Art by Paul Smith, who called it "a bad joke."<ref name="celeb20"/>]]

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #173, October 1983, writer Claremont and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] created a new look for Storm, abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants, and changing her former veil of white hair into a punk [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]].<ref name="uncannyxmen173">''Uncanny X-Men'' #173, Oct. 1983</ref> In a 2008 interview, Smith regretted the change as "a bad joke gone too far&nbsp;... I knew that they were going to cut the hair, so as a joke I put a [[Mr. T]] mohawk on her&nbsp;... [editor] [[Louise Simonson]] said 'We're gonna get hung {{sic}} no matter what we do, so let's commit the crime!' So we went with the Mohawk&nbsp;... But once you get into the whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand."<ref name="celeb20">''Marvel Spotlight: Uncanny X-Men 500 Issues Celebration'', p. 20</ref>

In the actual story, Storm's outlook on life darkens after her struggles with the Brood. These changes alienate her from Kitty for a time.  Storm is influenced in this by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], a friend of Wolverine, and the two become fast friends.<ref name="YukioStorm">{{cite web|url=http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32|title=Tegneserier: An interview with Chris Claremont|work=Serie Journalen|last1=Sørensen|first1=Tue|last2=Kristiansen|first2=Ulrik|date=May 1, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref><!--Do NOT add that Storm and Yukio became "lovers". While it has been suggested by fans, in an interview, Claremont discussed that Yukio and Storm as lovers never crossed his mind when writing them, compared to Colleen Wing and Misty Knight. Since the story lines were under Claremont at the time, it is incorrect to claim they became lovers.--> Claremont wrote an arc in which fellow mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] develops a mutant power neutralizing gun. The intended target is another X-Man, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], but Storm is hit instead, taking away her powers. Forge takes her back to his home in [[Dallas, Texas]] to recover. With his help, she adjusts to life without her powers, and they fall in love. When Storm learns that Forge built the weapon that took her powers, she is heartbroken and leaves him.<ref name="uncannyxmen185186">Claremont, Chris (w), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #185-186, 1984, Marvel Comics</ref>

By 1986, the question arose of whether the X-Men would be led by Storm or by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who was now married to [[Madelyne Pryor]] and an expectant husband. The two settled the matter in a duel in the Danger Room that saw Storm victorious.<ref name="uncannyxmen201">''Uncanny X-Men'' #201, 1986</ref> It was later revealed during the "Inferno" storyline that Madelyne's nascent psychic abilities had emerged during that duel, unbeknownst to her or anyone, and that she had subconsciously used those abilities to influence the duel.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Simonson, Louise]]|penciller=[[Simonson, Walter]]|inker=[[Milgrom, Al]]|story=Duet|title=[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]|volume=1|issue=38|date=March 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> During the 1988 "Fall of the Mutants" storyline, Claremont wrote arcs in which Storm is trapped in another dimension with Forge and regains her elemental powers,<ref name="uncannyxmen225227">''Uncanny X-Men'' #225-227, Jan.-March 1988</ref> and is captured by the evil cyborg [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]].<ref name="uncannyxmen248">''Uncanny X-Men'' #248, Sept. 1989</ref>  Although believed slain in that encounter, she resurfaced, having become amnesiac as a result of being physically regressed to childhood by Nanny.

While she slowly starts to regain her memories, she meets with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and they return to the X-Men together.<ref name="uncannyxmen265267">''Uncanny X-Men'' #265-267, Aug-Sept 1990</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>  In the following arc, ''[[X-Men: X-Tinction Agenda|The X-Tinction Agenda]]'', she is kidnapped to the mutant-exploiting fictional nation of [[Genosha]] and is temporarily transformed into a brainwashed mutate, but is in the end restored physically and mentally to her adult prime.<ref name="uncannyxmen270271">''Uncanny X-Men'' #270-271, 1991</ref>

===Growth as a character (1990s)===
In October 1991, the ''X-Men'' franchise was re-launched, centering on the new eponymous ''[[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]]'' (vol. 2) comic.  Claremont wrote Storm as the leader of the X-Men's Gold Team; the other team, Blue, was led by her colleague [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], the X-Man she once succeeded as leader.  Claremont left the X-Men comic 16 years after his debut in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #94 (1975), with his final issue (''X-Men'' #3) being published in Dec. 1991.  After 16 consecutive years, he was replaced by [[Jim Lee]], who maintained the portrayal of Storm as a strong leader.  In the sister title ''Uncanny X-Men'', now under [[Scott Lobdell]], Lobdell continued on the romance between Storm and Forge which culminated in Forge's proposal to wed in 1992.  Storm's slight hesitation, however, is misinterpreted by Forge, who then rescinds his offer before it can be accepted.<ref name="uncannyxmen289290">''Uncanny X-Men'' #289-290, June 1992</ref>  Lobdell waited until November 1993 before he wrote a reconciliation between the deeply pained Storm and Forge.<ref name="uncannyxmen306">''Uncanny X-Men'' #306, Nov. 1993</ref>  In 1995, Lobdell continued an arc again pitting the X-Men against the Morlocks.  As Claremont did with Callisto in 1983, Lobdell has Storm ending the battle by wounding her opponent in the heart.  Here, Storm rips out one heart of the two-hearted Morlock girl [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], which has a bomb affixed to it.<ref name="uncannyxmen325">''Uncanny X-Men'' #325, Oct. 1995</ref> In February 1996, Storm got her first miniseries, the eponymous ''Storm.''  In the first arc of the series, [[Warren Ellis]] writes a story in which Storm is sucked into a [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] and pitted against villain [[Mikhail Rasputin]].<ref name="storm14">''Storm'' #1-4, Feb-May 1996</ref>

===Contemporary Storm (2000s)===
In ''[[X-Treme X-Men]],'' conceived by a newly-reinstated Chris Claremont in July 2001, Storm was written as the leader of this team of more streetwise X-Men, including the former thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], former [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] member [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], anti-hero [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]], and the more tame [[Neal Shaara|third hero known as Thunderbird]].  This was in contrast to its more strait-laced sister titles, ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''New X-Men.''  In the period until its end in issue #46 (June 2004), Claremont continued to write Storm as the central character.  During this time, Storm enjoys a brief flirtation with younger fellow X-Man [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]] and is kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (comics)|Khan]].  Khan wants to make her his queen, but Storm defeats him.  In the series, she also becomes leader of the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]], a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority.<ref name="xtremexmen146">''X-Treme X-Men'' #1-46, July 2001-June 2004</ref>

In the aftermath of the 2005 ''[[House of M]]'' storyline (written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]]), [[Decimation (comics)|90% of the mutants lost their powers]].  Storm is among the [[List of the 198|198]] mutants who retain their powers.<ref name="houseofm">''[[House of M]]'', 2005</ref>  Also in that year, the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm'' of Mark Sumerak retold her backstory in greater detail, concentrating on her relationship with surrogate father figure Achmed el-Gibar during her childhood.<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14">''Ororo: Before the Storm'' #1-4, Aug-Nov 2005</ref>
[[Image:Stormbpmarriage.PNG|thumb|175px|The marriage of Storm and the Black Panther. Front cover for ''Black Panther'' #18 (2006), by Frank Cho.]]  In the following year, Marvel Comics announced that Ororo would marry fellow African super hero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].  Collaborating writer [[Eric Jerome Dickey]] explained that it was a move to explicitly target the female and [[African American]] audience.<ref>{{cite web

Storm later joins the reformed ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' (#25). She states that her official reason for joining the team is that Wakanda is a supporter of Mutantes Sans Frontieres and she believes she should be on the front line, however she is also somewhat bored of her life as queen.  The reemergence of the Shadow King later forces Storm to choose between her role as queen and her role as an X-Man.  Confronting the Panther God Bast, Storm asserts that she is not limited to being one or the other or anything else and that she is unafraid to do whatever is necessary to fulfill those responsibilities.  Regaining Bast's favor, the two defeat the Shadow King and Storm decides that she will remain Queen of Wakanda and remain with the X-Men, refusing to choose between them.<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart 1-4''</ref> Seeking to re-learn his limitations, T'Challa later leaves Africa and takes a new role as the guardian of Hell's Kitchen following the events of ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]''; Though the two remain a couple, Storm sadly but respectfully accepts T'Challa's request for temporary isolation so that he can find himself.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

After the [[X-Men: Regenesis|2011 revamp of the X-Men related comic books]] Storm appears as the leader of a defensive, reconnaissance based team of X-Men in the on-going [[X-Men (vol. 3)|''X-Men'' title]]. It was announced on October 15, 2011 that Storm will be joining the Avengers, beginning in ''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #19 released in November 2011.{{update after|2011|11|30}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Joins the Avengers|url=http://www.comicvine.com/articles/storm-joins-the-avengers/1100-143723/|publisher=Comic Vine}}</ref> However, she leaves the team to fight alongside the X-Men during the [[Avengers vs. X-Men|return of the Phoenix]], resulting in her facing T'Challa when he sides with the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #2</ref> When a Phoenix-empowered Namor destroys Wakanda,<ref>''Avengers vs X-Men'' #8</ref> Storm realizes the X-Men are out of control and returns to help the Avengers.

===X-Men (2013 series)===
In April 2013, Marvel debuted a new all-female series simply named ''X-Men''. Written by Brian Wood with art by Olivier Coipel, ''X-Men'' features a roster of Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey and Psylocke.<ref>{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=Joey|title=Marvel Debuts All-Female X-Men|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/01/14/marvel-debuts-all-female-x-men|publisher=IGN}}</ref>

===Amazing X-Men (2013 series)===
In late 2013, Marvel debuted ''[[Amazing X-Men]]'' by writer Jason Aaron.  Storm is a featured member of the team.  The initial adventure takes Storm to Hell along with Firestar and Iceman in an investigation of Bamf's activity.

===Solo series===

It has been confirmed that Storm will star in her own solo series written by Greg Pak with art by Victor Inanez.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=C2E2: Wolverine's "Three Months To Die," "Storm" Ongoing & New "Axis" Event Arrive|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=52448|publisher=Comic Book Resources}}</ref>

==Historical significance==
{{See also|African characters in comics}}
Storm was one of the first black comic book characters, and the first black female, to play either a major or supporting role in the big two comic book houses, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]].<ref name="FAH">{{citation|author=Gladys L. Knight|title=Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video games, Film, and Television|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2010|pages=278, 282|isbn=978-0-313-37612-2}}</ref> Within these two companies, her 1975 debut was only preceded by a few male black characters. In Marvel Comics, preceding characters were [[Gabe Jones]] (debuted in 1963), [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] (1966), [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] (1966), ''[[Spider-Man]]'' supporting characters [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|Joe Robertson]] (1967), his son [[Randy Robertson|Randy]] (1968), [[Prowler (comics)|Hobie Brown (the Prowler)]] & [[Falcon (comics)|The Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972), [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) and [[Sons of the Tiger|Abe Brown]] (1974).  In DC Comics, she was preceded by ''[[Teen Titans]]'' member [[Mal Duncan]] who debuted in 1970, ''[[Green Lantern]]'' wielder [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] (1971), and [[Mister Miracle]] protégé [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]] (1973); she preceded DC's other black heroes, ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' member [[Tyroc]] (who debuted in 1976), [[Black Lightning]] (1977), [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] (1980), [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] (1981) and [[Amazing Man]] (1983).  While not the first black character to be introduced, since her creation Storm has remained the most successful and recognizable black superhero.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Gladys L. Knight, author of ''Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video games, Film, and Television'' (2010) wrote that "two defining aspects of her persona are her racial identity and her social status as a mutant."<ref name="FAH"/> The X-Men have symbolically represented marginalized minorities and the debut of the ''X-Men'' series coincided with the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)]], in which their plight as mutants mirrored that of African Americans.<ref name="FAH"/> Storm's creation in particular "was during the heyday of [[blaxploitation]] films, which featured, among others, [[Pam Grier]], an African American actress who is considered a pioneer in female action hero films."<ref name="FAH"/>

==Fictional character biography==<!--STRICT adherence to WP:WAF!!-->
Ever since her inception in 1975, Storm's biography has largely stayed the same.  The framework was laid first by Chris Claremont, who fleshed out her backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #102 (1976)<ref name="uncannyxmen102"/> and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #117 (1979).<ref name="uncannyxmen117">''Uncanny X-Men'' #117, Jan. 1979</ref> Some reinterpretations were made in 2005 and 2006, where writers Mark Sumerak and Eric Jerome Dickey, respectively, rewrote part of her early history in the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm''<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14">''Ororo: Before the Storm'' #1-4, Aug-Nov 2005, Marvel Comics, writer Mark Sumerak</ref> and ''Storm'' (vol. 2).<ref name="storm16">''Storm'' (vol. 2) #1-6 miniseries, Apr-Nov 2006</ref>

According to established Marvel canon, Ororo Munroe is born in [[New York City]] as the child of Kenyan tribal princess N’Dare and American photographer David Munroe. When Ororo is six months old, she and her parents move to the Egyptian capital of [[Cairo]]. Five years later, during the [[Suez Crisis]], a fighter jet crashes into her parents’ house, killing them.  Buried under tons of rubble, Ororo survives but is [[orphan]]ed and left with intense [[claustrophobia]]. Her fear was once so intense that she was known to revert to a fetal position and approach a [[catatonic state]].<ref name="uncannyxmen102"/> (In recent years, Storm has more or less conquered her claustrophobia,<ref>"I may not like confined spaces, but it's been a long time since a wooden box could hold me, so all you've done is made me mad." ''Uncanny X-Men'' #491.</ref> and can freely move in tight spaces, even over long periods of time.<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart'' #1, Oct. 2008</ref>) After the death of her parents, Ororo wanders Cairo's back-alleys for a few weeks, until she is picked up by the benign street lord Achmed el-Gibar and becomes a prolific thief;<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14"/> among her victims is her future mentor [[Professor X]] who is there to meet the [[Shadow King]].<ref name="uncannyxmen117"/>  Following an inner urge, she wanders into the [[Serengeti]] as a teenager and meets [[Black Panther (comics)|T’Challa]], who would become her future husband.  Despite strong mutual feelings, the two part ways.<ref name="marvelteamup100"/><ref name="storm16">''Storm #1-6'' miniseries, April-Nov 2006</ref>

In the Serengeti, Ororo first displays her mutant ability to control the weather. Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who took her in and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village was going through a terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she threw off the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm of her kind but ill-thought-out gesture, and of the damage she caused. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and how she could fix the problem by properly distributing rain.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #77</ref>

For a time, she is worshiped as a rain goddess to an African tribe, practicing [[nudity|nudism]] and tribal [[spirituality]], before being recruited by Professor X into the X-Men.  Ororo receives the code name “Storm” and is established as a strong, serene character.<ref name="giantsizexmen1"/>  In her early career with the X-Men, she suffers a major claustrophobic attack, which prompts a revelation of her origin to her teammates.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #102</ref>  When [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] captures the team, Storm frees the X-Men from captivity.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #113</ref>  Storm is later captured by the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #129</ref> leading up to the X-Men's clash with [[Phoenix (comics)|Dark Phoenix]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #135-137</ref>  She becomes deputy leader of the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #138</ref> and supplants her colleague [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] as leader of the X-Men,<ref name="uncannyxmen139"/> a role she fills out during most of her time as a superhero.  She briefly became "Rogue Storm",<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #147</ref> and even switched bodies with the White Queen.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #151</ref>  She is attacked by [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #159</ref> and defeats [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], becoming the new leader of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170</ref> Following her leadership of the Morlocks through combat with Callisto, Storm begins to develop a darker side. Eventually, the X-Men are invited to Japan for Wolverine's wedding to [[Mariko Yashida]]. It is here that she meets Wolverine's old friend [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], and the two become fast friends. Storm is inspired by Yukio, who encourages Storm to embrace her emerging darker side. This leads Storm to drastically change her outward appearance to match her inner self and thus don her iconic punk drab.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #173</ref>

Storm is eventually deprived of her superhuman powers by a gun fired by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]; unknown to her, this device was designed by the mutant inventor [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #185</ref>  The depowered Ororo then first meets and falls in love with Forge, although he does not initially tell her that he is responsible for her power loss.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #186</ref>  She helps Forge battle [[Dire Wraith]]s,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #187-188</ref> before leaving him to rejoin the X-Men.

After [[Decimation (comics)|90% of the mutants of the world lose their powers]], Storm leaves the X-Men to go to Africa; rekindles her relationship with T’Challa, now a superhero known as Black Panther; marries him; and becomes the queen of the kingdom of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]]<ref name="blackpanther18">''Black Panther'' (vol. 5) #18, July 2006</ref> and joins the new Fantastic Four alongside her husband when Reed and Sue take a vacation.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #543</ref> On a mission in space, the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] told Black Panther and Storm that their children would have a special destiny.<ref name="FF544">{{Cite comic

After being forced to drive him out by striking Cyclops through the chest with a massive lightning bolt, the Shadow King then took control of Storm, only to be devoured in vengeance by Bast, the Panther God, who had agreed to hide inside of Storm's mind in order to take revenge on the Shadow King for possessing T'Challa.<ref name="xmenworldsapart1-4">''X-Men: Worlds Apart'' #1-4, October 2008-January 2009</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

===Weather control===
Storm is one of the most powerful [[Mutants (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] on Earth and has demonstrated a plethora of abilities, most of which are facets of her power to [[Weather manipulation|manipulate the weather]].<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

  | title = Storm: Marvel Universe

Storm possesses the [[Psionics|psionic]] ability to control all forms of [[weather]] over vast areas.  She has been able to control both Earthly and extraterrestrial ecosystems on several occasions. She can modify the temperature of the environment, control all forms of precipitation, humidity and moisture (at a molecular level), generate lightning and other electromagnetic atmospheric phenomena, and has demonstrated excellent control over [[atmospheric pressure]]. She can incite all forms of meteorological tempests, such as [[tornado]]es, [[thunderstorm]]s, [[blizzard]]s, and  [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s,<ref>She is able to "summon the softest breeze or the most torrential hurricane." Syd Barney-Hawke's ''Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 2: X-Men''. [[Marvel Comics]]. (2003-04-01). Retrieved on 2008-04-19. ISBN 0-7851-1199-9.</ref> as well as [[mist]]. She can dissipate such weather to form clear skies as well.

Her precise control over the atmosphere allows her to create special weather effects. She can create precipitation at higher or lower altitudes than normal, make whirlwinds travel pointing lengthwise in any direction, channel ambient [[electromagnetism]] through her body to generate electric blasts, [[Flash freezing|flash freeze]] objects and people, coalesce atmospheric pollutants into [[acid rain]] or [[toxic]] [[fog]], and, along with her natural ability of flight, summon [[wind current]]s strong enough to support her weight to elevate herself (or others) to fly at high altitudes and speeds. Her control is so great that she can even manipulate the air in a person's lungs. She can also control the pressure inside the human inner ear, an ability she uses to cause intense pain. She can also bend light using moisture in the air and her manipulation of mist and fog to appear partially transparent, and in later comics, nearly invisible.

Storm has also demonstrated the ability to control natural forces that include [[Space weather|cosmic storms]], [[solar wind]], [[ocean current]]s, and the [[electromagnetic field]]. She has demonstrated the ability to separate water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen via [[electrolysis]], allowing her to breathe underwater.<ref>{{Cite comic

}}</ref> While in outer space, she is able to affect and manipulate the interstellar and intergalactic media. Storm can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe in terms of energy patterns, detecting the flow of kinetic, thermal and electromagnetic energy behind weather phenomena and can bend this energy to her will.

Storm has been shown to be sensitive to the dynamics of the natural world, and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. She has once sensed a diseased and dying tree on the [[X-Mansion]] grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums—including water, and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet's magnetosphere.<ref>#29</ref> Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' Vol. 3 #34</ref> Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body. [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] have considered Storm an [[Omega-level mutant]] on one occasion.<ref>''Black Panther'' #21</ref>

===Magical potential===
Storm's ancestry supports the use of magic and [[witchcraft]].<ref name="Tarot">''The Marvel Tarot'' Direct Edition One Shot, June 2007</ref>  Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses.  Storm's matrilineal powers have even been linked to the ''real-world'' [[Rain Queen]]s of Balobedu, the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor, Ayesha, hails.  The [[Mystic Arcana]] series deals with Storm's ancestor Ashake, who worships the Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], also known as [[Oshtur (Marvel Comics)|Oshtur]] — the mother of [[Agamotto]].<ref>''Mystic Arcana'' (vol. 1) #1</ref>  Oshtur appears to have strong favor for the bloodline of Ororo.{{issue|date=December 2010}} For some unknown reason, since the dawn of Atlantis, this line of African women has been given distinguishing features of white hair, blue eyes, and powerful magic potential.{{issue|date=December 2010}} Although Storm has not developed her magical potential, it has been hinted at.<ref name="Tarot"/>  The Mystic Arcana series lists the characters with magic potential according to the Marvel Tarot deck.  The Tarot asserts Storm as being "High Priestess," the First Tarot's choice one-third of the time.  The other draws were the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Agatha Harkness]].  These three characters split the High Priestess card equally.  A timeline-divergent Storm became the sorceress who taught sorcery to [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] and some of Storm's alternate universe selves possess considerable magical talent.<ref>{{Comic book reference

===Combat and thievery===
Storm is an expert thief, and a skilled, cunning and gifted hand-to-hand fighter, trained by Achmed el-Gibar, Professor X, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and T'Challa, the Black Panther.  By using superior strategy, Storm has overcome physically stronger foes like [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and the [[Crimson Commando]] in hand-to-hand combat. Storm is an excellent marksman with handguns, and is proficient in the use of knives. Storm is also fluent in Russian, Arabic and Swahili.  As part of her paraphernalia, Storm carries a set of lock-picks (with which she has an extraordinary ability at picking locks, in an early appearance she was able to pick a lock with her teeth while her physical coordination was reduced to the level of an infant<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #112</ref>) and her ancestral ruby, which allows inter-dimensional transportation with the help of her lightning.<ref name="officalmarvelpage"/>

===Physical abilities and traits===
Storm's weather powers allow her body to compensate for climate extremes; on one occasion as she was trying to control an unnatural storm she becomes overwhelmed as her body temperature rises too high.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Scott Lobdell]]| artist = [[Chris Bachalo]]| story = | title = [[X-Men Unlimited]]| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = June 1993| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref> In ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' - X-Men (2004), it is stated that her powers enable her to breathe while moving at any speed and protect her from air friction, while granting her protection from temperature extremes of heat and cold; the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #1 (2007) states that Storm's body changes temperature in opposition to her environment so that the colder the environment the warmer her body gets, and the warmer the environment the colder her body gets. 

Her body compensates for rapid decreases or increases in atmospheric pressure.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #32</ref>  She can see in near-complete darkness and has superb dexterity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #113</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #151-152</ref>  Storm has been described as having one of the strongest wills among the X-Men, making her highly resistant to psychic attacks especially in tandem with electrical fields she creates around herself.  Telepaths have found it difficult to track her down and probe her thoughts.  Several of these traits are independent of her mutant status and are a result of her ancestry. Also, when utilizing her powers, Storm's eyes turn solid white.<ref name="officalmarvelpage"/>

Storm has been stated to be a possible Omega-Level Mutant.<ref>"Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men #1 Vol 1"</ref><ref>"Black Panther Vol 4 #21"</ref> Her potential is as of yet unrealized, and on one occasion the Super Giant stated that Storm was an "Omega-Level Mutate", grouping and targeting her with Omega-Level mutants such as Iceman and Rachel Grey.<ref>"New Avengers Vol 3 #9"</ref>

Storm's real name "Ororo" is translated in her tribal language as "Beauty".
