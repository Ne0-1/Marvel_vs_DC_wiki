'''Storm''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], first appearing in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975). Descended from a long line of African witch-priestesses, Storm is a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]] known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. She is able to control the weather and atmosphere and is considered to be one of the most powerful mutants on the planet.

Born '''Ororo Munroe''' to a tribal princess of [[Kenya]] and an African-American photojournalist father, Storm is raised in [[Harlem]], New York City, United States and [[Cairo]], Egypt. She was made an orphan after her parents were killed in the midst of an [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. An incident at this time also traumatized Munroe, leaving her with [[claustrophobia]] that she would struggle with for life. Storm is a member of the [[X-Men]], a group of mutant heroes fighting for peace and equal rights between mutants and humans. Under the tutelage of a master thief an adolescent Munroe became a skilled [[Pickpocketing|pickpocket]], the means of which she meets through coincidence the powerful mutant [[Professor X]]. Professor X later convinces Munroe to join the X-Men and use her abilities for a greater cause and purpose. Possessing natural leadership skills and formidable powers of her own, Storm has led the X-Men at times and has been a member of teams such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] as well.

Created during the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], Storm is the first major female character of African descent in comics. She is regarded by some as being Marvel Comics' most important female superhero, having drawn favorable comparison to [[DC Comics]]' most famous female lead [[Wonder Woman]]. When Marvel and DC Comics published a ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' miniseries in 1996, Storm was pitted against Wonder Woman in a one-on-one battle and emerged victorious due to winning a popular vote amongst readers. Storm is also part of one of the higher-profile romantic relationships in all of comics. Having married childhood sweetheart and fellow superhero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], the ruler of the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda]], Munroe was made [[queen consort]] through marriage. The title was lost however when the two later divorced. Storm also holds a close relationship with [[Kunoichi|female ninja]] [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]]; while the characters' relationship was originally conceived of as romantic, it was relegated to [[subtext]] after [[Marvel Comics]]' editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] mandated that no same-gender couples could be depicted in comic books during his tenure at the company.

Storm is one of the more prominent characters in the X-Men series, having appeared in various forms of media relating to the franchise, including animation, television, video games, and a series of films. The character was first portrayed in live-action by [[Halle Berry]] in 2000 film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''. Berry returned to portray the role in the films ''[[X2 (film)|X2]],'' ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]],'' and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]].'' The younger version of Storm was portrayed by [[Alexandra Shipp]] in the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''. Shipp had a cameo in ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' and reprised her role in the 2019 film ''[[X-Men: Dark Phoenix]]''. In 2011, Storm was ranked 42nd overall on [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes" list.

[[Image:giantsize1.jpg|175px|left|thumb|''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975) is Storm's first appearance. Art by [[Gil Kane]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].]]
Storm first appeared in 1975 in the comic book ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum.  In this comic, Wein uses a battle against the living island [[Krakoa]] to replace the first-generation X-Men of the 1960s with new X-Men.<ref name="giantsizexmen1">''Giant Size X-Men'' #1 (1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> Storm was an amalgam of two characters Cockrum created: The Black Cat and Typhoon.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 50–52}}</ref> The Black Cat had Storm's costume, minus the cape, and was submitted for the new X-Men's original lineup. However, during a hiatus in the new X-Men project, other female cat characters like [[Tigra]] were introduced, making the Black Cat redundant.<ref name="MarvelDays"/>

Since the creative team did not want the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group.<ref name="TyphoonDave"/> Cockrum liked the idea and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm's white hair would make her look like a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.<ref name="TyphoonDave"/><ref name="MarvelDays">{{cite web| last = Cooke| first = John B.| title = The Marvel Days of the Co-Creator of the New X-Men| url = http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06cockrum.html| access-date = December 1, 2006| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024205417/http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06cockrum.html| archive-date = October 24, 2012}}</ref>

[[Chris Claremont]] followed up Wein as the writer of the flagship title ''The Uncanny X-Men'' in 1975, writing many notable X-Men stories, among them ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'' and "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]", which served as the basis for the films ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', respectively. In both arcs, Storm is written as a major supporting character. Claremont stayed the main writer of ''X-Men'' for the next 16 years and consequently wrote most of the publications containing Storm.

===Backstory===
In ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #102 (December 1976), Claremont established Storm's backstory. Storm's mother, N'Dare, was the princess of a tribe in [[Kenya]] and descended from a long line of African witch-priestesses with white hair, blue eyes, and a natural gift for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  N'Dare falls in love with and marries American photojournalist, David Munroe. They move to [[Harlem]] in uptown New York City, where Ororo is born.<ref name="uncannyxmen102"/> They later moved to [[Egypt]] and lived there until they die during the [[Suez Crisis]] in a botched aircraft attack, leaving six-year-old Ororo as an orphan. <!--Although the original version of this story stated that the bomb was dropped by a jet of the [[Israeli Air Force]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, later stories such as in ''Classic X-Men'' have revised the bombing first to an event of the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and then to an unnamed military conflict.--> Her violent [[claustrophobia]] is established as a result of being buried under tons of rubble after that attack. She becomes a skilled thief in [[Cairo]] under the benign Achmed el-Gibar and wanders into the [[Serengeti]] as a young woman. She is worshipped as a goddess when her powers appear before being recruited by [[Professor X]] for the X-Men.<ref name="uncannyxmen102">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #102 (December 1976) Marvel Comics</ref>

Claremont further fleshed out Storm's backstory in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #117 (January 1979). He retroactively added that Professor X, who recruits her in ''Giant Size X-Men'' #1 of 1975, had already met her as a child in Cairo. As Ororo grows up on the streets and becomes a proficient thief under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar, one of her most notable victims was Charles Francis Xavier, later Professor X. He is able to use his mental powers to temporarily prevent her escape and recognizes the potential in her. However, when Xavier is attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk, the [[Shadow King]], the two men are preoccupied enough with their battle to allow the girl to escape. Both Xavier and the Shadow King recognize Storm as the young girl later.<ref name=UncannyXMen117>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #117 January 1979. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1980s: Punk look and loss of powers===
In the following issues, Claremont portrayed Storm as a serene, independent character. Although Storm was initially written having trouble adjusting to [[Western culture]], e.g. calling the obligation to wear clothing in public "absurd",<ref name="uncannyxmen109">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #109 (February 1978). Marvel Comics</ref> in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #139 (November 1980), Claremont established her as the leader of the X-Men after Cyclops takes a leave of absence,<ref name="uncannyxmen139">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #139 (November 1980). Marvel Comics</ref> a position she holds in various incarnations. Claremont also established a maternal relationship between Storm and the 13-year-old X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]]. A short story by Claremont set during Storm's childhood in Kenya that ran in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #100 (December 1980), establishes that when she was 12 years old, Storm saved a young [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] from racist thugs.<ref name="marvelteamup100">"Cry--Vengeance!," ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #100 (December 1980). Marvel Comics.</ref> This story would later become the basis for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters.<ref name="cbrmarriage">{{cite web| last = Weiland| first = Jonah| title = Hudlin & Dickey talk Black Panther/Storm Wedding| url = http://www.cbr.com/hudlin-dickey-talk-black-pantherstorm-wedding/| publisher = [[CBR.com]]| date = January 26, 2006| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043327/http://www.cbr.com/hudlin-dickey-talk-black-pantherstorm-wedding/| archive-date = April 4, 2017}}</ref>

In the early 1980s, adventures of Storm written by Claremont included a [[space opera]] arc, in which the X-Men fight parasitic beings called the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]. Storm is infected with a Brood egg and contemplates suicide, but then experiences a last-minute save by the benign whale-like [[Acanti]] aliens.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #162-#166 (September 1982 – February 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref> Storm's fellow X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] is abducted by a rogue [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] group called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. The X-Men are outnumbered, and Storm is rendered sick by the Morlock called Plague. To save Kitty's life, Storm challenges the Morlocks' leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], in a duel to the death for the leadership of the Morlocks. Despite being violently sick, she defeats Callisto by stabbing her with a knife. Callisto is saved through the efforts of a Morlock healer, and Storm offers the Morlocks refuge at the Xavier Mansion, though they decline.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #169–170 (May – June 1983).

[[Image:Storm22.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Storm's punk look by [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], who called it "a bad joke that got way out of hand."<ref name="celeb20"/>]]
In ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #173 (October 1983), Claremont and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] created a new look for Storm, abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants, and changing her former veil of white hair into a punk [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #173 (October 1983). Marvel Comics.</ref> The change in appearance was inspired by the decision of colleague [[Walt Simonson]] to shave off his beard and mustache while on vacation with his wife, ''X-Men'' editor [[Louise Simonson]]. Upon their return, Simonson's daughter, Julie, upset at her father's new appearance, ran from the room.<ref name=CBR3.3.17>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian |date=March 3, 2017|url=http://www.cbr.com/storm-x-men-mohawk-walter-simonson-louise-paul-smith-chris-claremont/ |title=Comic Legends: How a Shaved Simonson Gave Us Mohawk Storm!|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402081409/http://www.cbr.com/storm-x-men-mohawk-walter-simonson-louise-paul-smith-chris-claremont/ |archive-date=April 2, 2017 |website=CBR.com}}</ref> When the editors decided to change Storm's appearance, Smith submitted a number of designs to them, explaining in a 2008 interview:

<blockquote>I did a number of portraits, all quite lovely and feminine. As a joke, I included a shot of her as Mr. T. You know, the kind of shot where they HAVE to go the other way. Weezie [''X-Men'' editor [[Louise Simonson]]]'s response? 'They're going to hang us whichever way we go. Let's commit the murder.' I argued it was a joke and a monstrously bad idea but, given my departure following 175 was set prior to beginning my run, my vote didn't count. So I did what I could with what I had left... So we went with the Mohawk&nbsp;...But once you get into the whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand.<ref name="celeb20">''Marvel Spotlight: Uncanny X-Men 500 Issues Celebration'' (2008), Marvel Comics. p. 20</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian |date=October 28, 2011|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/10/28/comic-book-legends-revealed-338/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #338|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828015319/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/10/28/comic-book-legends-revealed-338/ |archive-date=28 August 2015 |website=Comic Book Resources}}</ref></blockquote>

Julie Simonson's reaction to her father's new appearance would be mirrored in X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]]'s heartbroken rejection of Storm's new look.<ref name=CBR3.3.17/> In the story, Storm's outlook on life darkens after her struggles with the Brood. These changes alienate her from Kitty for a time.

By 1986, the question arose of whether the X-Men would be led by Storm or by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], who was now married to [[Madelyne Pryor]] and an expectant husband. The two settled the matter in a duel in the [[Danger Room]] that saw Storm victorious.<ref name="uncannyxmen201">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #201 (1986) Marvel Comics</ref> It was later revealed during the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" storyline that Madelyne's nascent psychic abilities had emerged during that duel, unbeknownst to her or anyone, and that she had subconsciously used those abilities to influence the duel.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Simonson, Louise]]|penciller=[[Simonson, Walter]]|inker=[[Milgrom, Al]]|story=Duet|title=[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]|volume=|issue=#38|date=March 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

During the 1988 "[[Fall of the Mutants]]" storyline, Storm is trapped in another dimension with Forge, who restores her elemental powers. Following her rejoining the X-Men, they defeat a demonic enemy called the Adversary, in a battle in which the public believes the X-Men have died. They survive, with the help of the celestial being known as [[Roma (comics)|Roma]].

===1990s===
[[File:Storm (Marvel Comics - 1990s).png|thumb|upright|Storm, during the 1990s. Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]
In October 1991, the ''X-Men'' franchise was re-launched, centering on the new eponymous ''[[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]]'' comic. Claremont wrote Storm as the leader of the X-Men's Gold Team. The other team, Blue, was led by her colleague [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], the X-Man she once succeeded as the leader. In the sister title ''Uncanny X-Men'', now under [[Scott Lobdell]], Lobdell continued on the romance between Storm and Forge, which culminated in Forge's proposal to wed in 1992. Storm's slight hesitation, however, is misinterpreted by Forge, who then rescinds his offer before it can be accepted.<ref name="uncannyxmen289290">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #289–290 (June 1992) Marvel Comics</ref> Lobdell waited until November 1993 before he wrote a reconciliation between the deeply pained Storm and Forge.<ref name="uncannyxmen306">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #306 (November 1993) Marvel Comics</ref> In 1995, Lobdell continued an arc again pitting the X-Men against the Morlocks. As Claremont did with Callisto in 1983, Lobdell has Storm ending the battle by wounding her opponent in the heart. Here, Storm rips out one heart of the two-hearted Morlock girl [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], which has a bomb affixed to it.<ref name="uncannyxmen325">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #325 (October 1995) Marvel Comics</ref> In February 1996, Storm got her first miniseries, the eponymous ''Storm.'' In the first arc of the series, [[Warren Ellis]] writes a story in which Storm is sucked into an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] and pitted against villain [[Mikhail Rasputin]].<ref name="storm14">''Storm'' #1–4 (February – May 1996) Marvel Comics</ref>

===2000s===
In ''[[X-Treme X-Men]],'' conceived by a newly reinstated Chris Claremont in July 2001, Storm was written as the leader of this team, and the central character of the book, until its end in issue #46 (June 2004). During this time, Storm enjoys a brief flirtation with younger fellow X-Man [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]] and is kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (comics)|Khan]]. In the series, Storm also becomes the leader of the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]], a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority.<ref name="xtremexmen146">''X-Treme X-Men'' #1–46 (July 2001 – June 2004) Marvel Comics</ref>

During the 2005 "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" storyline, in which 90% of the mutants lose their powers, Storm is among the [[List of the 198|198]] mutants who retain their powers.<ref name="houseofm">"[[House of M]]" (2005) Marvel Comics</ref> Also that year, the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm'' by writer Mark Sumerak retold her backstory in greater detail, concentrating on her relationship with surrogate father figure Achmed el-Gibar during her childhood.<ref name=OroroBeforeStorm>Sumerak, Mark (w). ''Ororo: Before the Storm'' #1–4 (August – November 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The following year, Marvel Comics announced that Storm would marry fellow African super hero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

Storm joins the reformed ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #25 because she explains, Wakanda is a supporter of Mutantes Sans Frontieres and she believes she should be on the front line, however, she is also somewhat bored of her life as queen. The reemergence of the Shadow King later forces Storm to choose between her role as queen and her role as an X-Man. Confronting the Panther God Bast, Storm asserts that she is not limited to being one or the other or anything else and that she is unafraid to do whatever is necessary to fulfill those responsibilities.

==Historical significance==
{{See also|African characters in comics}}
Storm was one of the first black comic book characters, and the first black female, except for [[Misty Knight]], who debuted in a comic dated March 1975, to play either a major or supporting role in the big two comic book houses, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]].<ref name="FAH">{{citation|author=Gladys L. Knight|title=Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video games, Film, and Television|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2010|pages=278, 282|isbn=978-0-313-37612-2}}</ref> Within these two companies, her 1975 debut was only preceded by a few male black characters and [[Misty Knight]]. In Marvel Comics, preceding characters were [[Gabe Jones]] (debuted in 1963), [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] (1966), [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] (1966), ''[[Spider-Man]]'' supporting characters [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|Joe Robertson]] (1967), his son [[Randy Robertson|Randy]] (1968), [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Hobie Brown (the Prowler)]] & [[Falcon (comics)|The Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972), [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973), [[Sons of the Tiger|Abe Brown]] (1974), and [[Misty Knight]] (March 1975).  In DC Comics, she was preceded by ''[[Teen Titans]]'' member [[Mal Duncan]] who debuted in 1970, ''[[Green Lantern]]'' wielder [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] (1971), and [[Mister Miracle]] protégé [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]] (1973); she preceded DC's other black heroes, ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' member [[Tyroc]] (who debuted in 1976), [[Black Lightning]] (1977), [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] (1977), [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] (1980), [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] (1981) and [[Amazing-Man (DC Comics)|Amazing-Man]] (1983).

Gladys L. Knight, author of ''Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video games, Film, and Television'' (2010) wrote that "two defining aspects of her persona are her racial identity and her social status as a mutant."<ref name="FAH"/> The X-Men have symbolically represented marginalized minorities and the debut of the ''X-Men'' series coincided with the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in which their plight as mutants mirrored that of African Americans.<ref name="FAH"/> Storm's creation in particular "was during the heyday of [[blaxploitation]] films."<ref name="FAH"/>

==Fictional character biography==<!--STRICT adherence to WP:WAF!!-->
Ever since her inception in 1975, Storm's biography has largely stayed the same.  The framework was laid first by Chris Claremont, who fleshed out her backstory in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #102 (1976),<ref name="uncannyxmen102"/> #113 (1978)<ref name=UncannyXMen113>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #113. Marvel Comics.</ref> and #117 (1979).<ref name=UncannyXMen117/> Some reinterpretations were made in 2005 and 2006, where writers Mark Sumerak and Eric Jerome Dickey, respectively, rewrote part of her early history in the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm''<ref name=OroroBeforeStorm/> and ''Storm'' vol. 2.<ref name=StormV2>''Storm'' vol. 2 #1–6 miniseries (April – November 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

According to established Marvel canon, Ororo Munroe is born in New York City as the child of Kenyan tribal princess N'Dare and American photographer David Munroe. When Ororo is six months old, she and her parents move to the Egyptian capital of [[Cairo]]. Five years later, during the [[Suez Crisis]], a fighter jet crashes into her parents' house, killing them. Buried under tons of rubble, Ororo survives but is [[orphan]]ed and left with intense [[claustrophobia]]. Her fear was once so intense that she was known to curl into a fetal position and approach a [[catatonic state]].<ref name="uncannyxmen102"/> In late 2000s storylines, however, writers like [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Christopher Yost]] have indicated that Storm had largely conquered her claustrophobia,<ref>"I may not like confined spaces, but it's been a long time since a wooden box could hold me, so all you've done is made me mad." ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #491. Marvel Comics.</ref> and can freely move in tight spaces, even over long periods of time.<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart'' #1 (October 2008).

Despite strong mutual feelings, the two part ways.<ref name="marvelteamup100"/><ref name=StormV2/>

In the Serengeti, Ororo first displays her mutant ability to control the weather. Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who took her in and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village was going through a terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she threw off the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm of her kind but poorly considered gesture, and of the damage she caused. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and how she could fix the problem by properly distributing rain.<ref>''X-Men'' #77. Marvel Comics.</ref>

For a time, she is worshiped as a rain goddess to an African tribe, practicing [[nudity|nudism]] and tribal [[spirituality]], before being recruited by Professor X into the X-Men.

Storm is inspired by Yukio, who encourages Storm to embrace her emerging darker side.

===Weather control===
[[File:Storm portrait.png|thumb|Storm holding her Stormcaster in ''X-Men: Gold'' #25. Art by Paulo Siqueira.]]
Storm is one of the most powerful [[Mutants (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] on Earth and has demonstrated a plethora of abilities, most of which are facets of her power to [[Weather manipulation|manipulate the weather]].<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web  |last = marvel.com  |title = Storm: Marvel Universe  |url = http://www.marvel.com/universe/Storm  |access-date = December 1, 2006 |url-status = live  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061127173541/http://www.marvel.com/universe/Storm  |archive-date = November 27, 2006 }}</ref> Storm possesses the [[Psionics|psionic]] ability to control all forms of weather over vast areas. She has been able to control both Earthly and extraterrestrial ecosystems. She can modify the temperature of the environment, control all forms of precipitation, humidity, and moisture (at a molecular level), generate lightning and other electromagnetic atmospheric phenomena, and has demonstrated excellent control over [[atmospheric pressure]]. She can incite all forms of meteorological tempests, such as [[tornado]]es, [[thunderstorm]]s, [[blizzard]]s, and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s,<ref>She is able to "summon the softest breeze or the most torrential hurricane." Syd Barney-Hawke's ''Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 2: X-Men''. Marvel Comics. (April 1, 2003). {{ISBN|0-7851-1199-9}}.</ref> as well as [[mist]]. She can dissipate such weather to form clear skies as well.

Her precise control over the atmosphere allows her to create special weather effects. She can create precipitation at higher or lower altitudes than normal, make whirlwinds travel pointing lengthwise in any direction, channel ambient [[electromagnetism]] through her body to generate electric blasts, [[Flash freezing|flash freeze]] objects and people, coalesce atmospheric pollutants into [[acid rain]] or [[toxic]] [[fog]], and, along with her natural ability of flight, summon wind currents strong enough to support her weight to elevate herself (or others) to fly at high altitudes and speeds. Her control is so great that she can even manipulate the air in a person's lungs. She can also control the pressure inside the human inner ear, an ability she uses to cause intense pain. She can also bend light using moisture in the air and her manipulation of mist and fog to appear partially transparent, and in later comics, nearly invisible.

Storm has also demonstrated the ability to control natural forces that include [[Space weather|cosmic storms]], [[solar wind]], [[ocean current]]s, and the [[electromagnetic field]].<ref>{{Cite comic

}}</ref> While in outer space, she is able to affect and manipulate the interstellar and intergalactic media. Storm can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe in terms of energy patterns, detecting the flow of kinetic, thermal and electromagnetic energy behind weather phenomena and can bend this energy to her will.

Storm has been shown to be sensitive to the dynamics of the natural world, and her psionic powers over the weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. She has once sensed a diseased and dying tree on the [[X-Mansion]] grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums—including water, and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet's magnetosphere.{{issue|date=April 2017}} Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #34.

===Magical potential===
Storm's ancestry supports the use of magic and [[witchcraft]].<ref name="Tarot">''The Marvel Tarot'' Direct Edition One Shot, June 2007. Marvel Comics.</ref> Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses.  Storm's matrilineal powers have even been linked to the ''real-world'' [[Rain Queen]]s of Balobedu, the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor, Ayesha, hails. The [[Mystic Arcana]] series deals with Storm's ancestor Ashake, who worships the Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], also known as Oshtur – the mother of Agamotto.<ref>''Mystic Arcana'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Oshtur appears to have strong favor for the bloodline of Ororo.{{issue|date=December 2010}} For some unknown reason, since the dawn of Atlantis, this line of African women has been given distinguishing features of white hair, blue eyes, and powerful magic potential.{{issue|date=December 2010}} Although Storm has not developed her magical potential, it has been hinted at.<ref name="Tarot"/> The Mystic Arcana series lists the characters with magic potential according to the Marvel Tarot deck.  The Tarot asserts Storm as being "High Priestess", the First Tarot's choice one-third of the time. The other draws were the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Agatha Harkness]].  These three characters split the High Priestess card equally. A timeline-divergent Storm became the sorceress who taught sorcery to [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] and some of Storm's alternate universe selves possess considerable magical talent.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Chris Claremont]]| penciller=[[John Buscema]]| inker=[[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]]| story=Little Girl Lost| title=[[Magik (Illyana and Storm)|Magik]]|issue=#1|date=December 1983| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> On a separate note, it has been stated that Storm's spirit is so strong that she was able to host the consciousness of an [[Incarnation|avatar]] (or "[[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|manifestation body]]"<ref name="M-bodies">[[Gruenwald, Mark]] (w). ''Quasar'' #38. Marvel Comics.</ref>) of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]; in a gathering consisting of herself, [[Doctor Strange]], Black Panther, Silver Surfer and the [[Fantastic Four]], she and Doctor Strange were the only viable candidates.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #550. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Combat and thievery===
Storm's willpower is strong enough to defy Dracula's commands after he bites her.{{r|uxmv1no159}} She is an expert thief, and a skilled, cunning and gifted hand-to-hand fighter, trained by Achmed el-Gibar, Professor X, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and T'Challa, the Black Panther. By using superior strategy, Storm has overcome physically stronger foes like [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and the [[Crimson Commando]] in hand-to-hand combat. Storm is an excellent marksman with handguns, and is proficient in the use of knives. Storm is also fluent in Russian, Arabic, and Swahili. As part of her paraphernalia, Storm carries a set of lock-picks (with which she has an extraordinary ability at picking locks, including her teeth while her physical coordination was reduced to the level of an infant<ref name=UncannyXMen113/>) and her ancestral ruby, which allows inter-dimensional transportation with the help of her lightning.<ref name="officalmarvelpage"/>

===Physical abilities and traits===
Storm's weather powers allow her body to compensate for climate extremes; on one occasion as she was trying to control an unnatural storm she becomes overwhelmed as her body temperature rises too high.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Scott Lobdell]]| artist = [[Chris Bachalo]]| title = [[X-Men Unlimited]]| volume = | issue = #1| date = June 1993| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> In ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' – X-Men (2004), it is stated that her powers enable her to breathe while moving at any speed and protect her from air friction, while granting her protection from temperature extremes of heat and cold; the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #1 (2007) states that Storm's body changes temperature in opposition to her environment so that the colder the environment the warmer her body gets, and the warmer the environment the colder her body gets.

Her body compensates for rapid decreases or increases in atmospheric pressure.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref> She can see in near-complete darkness and has superb dexterity.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #113. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #151–152. Marvel Comics.</ref> Storm has been described as having one of the strongest wills among the X-Men, making her highly resistant to psychic attacks especially in tandem with electrical fields she creates around herself.  Telepaths have found it difficult to track her down and probe her thoughts. Several of these traits are independent of her mutant status and are a result of her ancestry. Also, when using her powers, Storm's eyes turn solid white.<ref name="officalmarvelpage"/>

Storm has been stated to be an Omega-Level Mutant.<ref>''Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''House of X'' #1</ref>

Her potential is as of yet unrealized, and on one occasion the Super Giant stated that Storm was an "Omega-Level Mutate", grouping and targeting her with Omega-Level mutants such as Iceman and Rachel Grey.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her Omega-Level status was eventually confirmed.<ref>''House of X'' #1</ref>

Storm's real name "Ororo" is translated in her language as "Beauty".

==Other versions==
{{anchor|Alternative versions of Storm}}
In addition to her [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation, the Marvel Comics character Storm has been depicted in other [[fictional universes]]. These alternative representations differ considerably from the details and events of the main "Storm" story, without affecting that story's narrative continuity.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the hellish reality known as the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Storm is a member of the X-Men, but more streetwise and tough, and her romantic interest is [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. Her appearance differs in that she has a black lightning tattoo over her left eye and a bob hair cut.<ref>''X-Men: Alpha''</ref>

Years after the fall of Apocalypse, Weapon X, the AoA version of Wolverine whose mind was twisted into making him the heir of Apocalypse, captured and renamed her as Orordius after using the Celestial technology on her to enslave and transform her into a blind seer made of living stone.<ref name="alternatestorm">{{cite web | last = uncannyxmen.net |title = Spotlight on Storm: Alternate Versions |url = http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/spotlight/showquestion.asp?faq=10&fldAuto=76&page=12 |access-date = 2006-12-01 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060602152015/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/spotlight/showquestion.asp?faq=10&fldAuto=76&page=12 |archive-date = 2006-06-02 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

===Deadpool Corps===
Professor X runs an orphanage for troubled kids where Storm is the headmistress. Kid versions of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Deadpool are sent to her office for causing trouble.<ref>''Prelude to [[Deadpool]] Corps'' #2</ref>

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In [[Marvel Mangaverse]], Storm is a witch who trained with Abigail Hefton. She is later seen as a mutant. It is implied she was killed by [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]].{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Marvel Zombies===
The basic premise of the various [[Marvel Zombies]] stories is that almost all super-powered beings on Earth have become flesh-eating zombies after being infected by an alien virus. Alongside Thor, [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]], Colossus, and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Storm is one of the last super-humans on her world to become a zombie.{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===Marriage to Forge===
[[New X-Men]] posits an alternative future for Storm in which she, under her birth name Ororo, marries [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and lives a happy married life in his building, Eagle's Plaza in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].{{issue|date=September 2020}}

===NOW WHAT! (Marvel)===
In this universe, Spider-Storm appears who is a amalgamation of Storm and Spider-Man. She is a member of the X-Vengers.<ref>''Marvel: NOW WHAT!'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

===Amalgam Comics===
[[Amalgam Comics]] was a brief publishing collaboration between Marvel and [[DC Comics]], enabling characters owned by both companies to interact, and creating characters that were composites of Marvel and DC characters. Here, Ororo is a mutant with superpowers who nearly drowns as a child, but is rescued by [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] of the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]. Hippolyta raises young Ororo as an Amazon princess beside her own daughter Diana (see [[Wonder Woman]]) on the island of Themiscyra. She eventually leaves her island home to enter "Man's World" as [[Amazon (Amalgam Comics)|Amazon]], Amalgam's fusion of Storm and Wonder Woman. She joins the [[JLX (comics)|JLX]] — a cross between the [[Justice League]] of DC Comics and Marvel's X-Men, consisting of similarly merged characters — and becomes their leader.<ref>''Amazon'' #1 (April 1996). Amalgam Comics, Terry Austin and John Byrne.</ref>

===''Days of Future Past''===
In the dystopian ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' storyline of Chris Claremont (1981), Storm is one of the last fighters of the mutant resistance and is killed by a horde of robotic, mutant-hunting [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref name="alternatestorm"/><ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142 (January – February 1981). Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref>

===Earth X===
In a contemporary alternative universe, the ''[[Earth X]]'' series (started 1999 by [[Jim Krueger]]), Storm is known as "Queen Storm" and is married to [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], something that happens in the mainstream universe seven years later.<ref name="alternatestorm"/><ref>''Earth X'', started in 1999, Marvel Comics, creators Jim Krueger and Alex Ross</ref>

===Exiles===
Two versions of Storm have appeared in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'':
* A version of Storm that was similar to her mainstream counterpart was killed by the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] in a world where [[Jean Grey]] manifested the Phoenix force in a manner reminiscent of [[The Dark Phoenix Saga]].<ref>''Exiles'' #4</ref>
* One of the more prominent versions of Storm is a sixteen-year-old version of Ororo Munroe who is a member of the ruthless reality-hopping team [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]].<ref>''Exiles'' #12</ref>

===Mutant X (Marvel Comics)===
[[Image:bloodstorm1.jpg|thumb|right|{{Descript-inner-art|Mutant X||1|October 1998}} Art by [[Tom Raney]] ]]
''Bloodstorm'' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[vampire]] from an alternative universe within the Marvel Comics [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=59}}</ref> She is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] version of the [[X-Men]]'s Storm. Though introduced as a [[supporting character]] in ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'', she quickly became the [[breakout character]] of the series. Editors reported that the majority of fan mail to ''Mutant X'' was focused on her.<ref>"Parallel Lines" letters page, ''Mutant X'' #7 (April 1999)</ref>

Bloodstorm's history branches from her [[Earth-616|mainstream]] counterpart during the events of ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #159, in that she was not saved from the bite of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and was transformed into a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]. As she still retains her oath not to kill (in mainstream continuity she did not break that oath until ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #170, after her encounter with Dracula), Bloodstorm employs [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and [[Kitty Pryde]] as food sources, draining from them enough to sustain herself but not to kill them.<ref>''Mutant X'' #4 (January 1999)</ref> She leaves the X-Men and joins the team [[Mutant X (comics)|The Six]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (October 1998)</ref>

===Limbo Storm===
In ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160 (August 1982). Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> and in the ''[[Magik (Illyana and Storm)]]'' limited series,<ref>''Magik'' #1-4 (December 1983 – March 1984). Marvel Comics, writer Chris Claremont</ref> an alternative Storm is introduced, who lives the remaining years of her life in the demonic realm of [[Otherplace|Limbo]].<ref name="alternatestorm"/>

===Old Man Logan===
In the "[[Old Man Logan]]" storyline, Storm is among the X-Men who perish at the hands of Wolverine when he is tricked by Mysterio into believing his friends are super-villains attacking the mansion.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Storm is a founding member of the "[[Ultimate X-Men]]", created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Joe Quesada]] in February 2001. Millar, who wrote for the series until July 2003, established Storm as an illegal immigrant from [[Morocco]] who lived in [[Athens, Texas]] as a car thief prior joining the X-Men. In contrast to her mainstream counterpart, Ultimate Storm initially has trouble controlling her powers. For example, she once passes out after reluctantly summoning an [[electrical storm]] in order to destroy a fleet of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]; her reluctance stemming from a past incident where she nearly electrocuted a playground full of children.<ref name="ultimatexmen1">''Ultimate X-Men'' #1 (February 2001). Marvel Comics, writer Mark Millar</ref>

When later writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] seemingly killed Beast off in April 2004,<ref name="ultimatexmen44">''Ultimate X-Men'' #44 (April 2004). Marvel Comics, writer Brian Michael Bendis</ref> a grief-stricken Storm drastically alters her appearance. This change parallels the transformation her mainstream counterpart goes through under Claremont and Smith.<ref name="ultimatexmen46">''Ultimate X-Men'' #46 (June 2004). Marvel Comics, writer Brian Michael Bendis</ref>

Subsequent writer [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote Storm to act as the team's conscience and started a relationship between her and [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]]. In the "Ultimate X-Men: Shock and Awe" arc (2005), Vaughan inserted new elements into her back story by establishing [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Marvel|Yuriko "Yuri" Oyama]] as Storm's [[archenemy]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men: Shock and Awe'' (2005). Marvel Comics, writer Brian K. Vaughan</ref>

===X-Men: Forever===
In this alternative reality (with a history identical to 616), Storm kills Wolverine for unknown reasons as an agent of the Consortium (as yet unrevealed) and betrays the X-Men. As the X-Men search for her in New York City, an adolescent Storm with short hair appears to Gambit, just as young as she had appeared to him before. When Beast checks bloodwork, both Storms are identical.  At the series conclusion, with the adult Storm-clone, now calling herself 'Perfect Storm', having become Wakanda's Queen after killing the Black Panther, the other two Storms merge into another adult Storm, keeping Perfect Storm prisoner while taking her place as Wakanda's Queen to undo the harm she had caused.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===''What If...?''===
Marvel's ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' comic book series, which imagines alternative realities for Marvel characters, has featured Storm several times.  The depicted relationship between Wolverine and Storm was also shown in the X-Men animated series episode "X-Men: The Animated Series: 'One Man's Worth'" (1995).<ref name="alternatestorm"/><ref>{{cite web | last = bcdb.com | title = X-Men: The Animated Series: "One Man's Worth, Part 1 and 2" | url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Other_Studios/S/Saban_Entertainment/X-Men/more3.html | access-date = 2006-12-01 }}</ref>

==In other media==
{{Main|Storm in other media}}

==Reception==
In the 2007 [[Glyph Comics Awards]], the Fan Award for Best Comic was won by ''Storm'', by Eric Jerome Dickey, David Yardin & Lan Medina, and Jay Leisten & Sean Parsons.

Storm was ranked as the 89th greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 | title=Wizard's top 200 characters.
