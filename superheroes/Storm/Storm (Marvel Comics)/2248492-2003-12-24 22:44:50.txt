==History==
<!-- I'm not sure her early years are accurately reflected here. -->

Although born in [[Manhattan]] in the [[United States]] her mother, N'Dare, was the princess of a tribe in Kenya who fell in love and married an American photojournalist David Munroe.  When Ororo was six months old, she and her parents moved to [[Cairo, Egypt]].  Five years later, a bomb destroyed their home leaving Ororo trapped in the collapsed building along side her dead mother.  As a result of the experience, Ororo has lived with [[claustrophobia]] all her life.  Ororo grew up on the streets and became a proficient [[thief]] under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar.

As a teenager, she proved to be a [[mutant]], with the power to control the [[weather]].  She can control the winds to enable her to fly, and can manipulate lightning, storms, and other types of weather.  Her stark white hair and blue eyes are also evidence of her mutant nature.

As a young woman, she moved deeper into [[Africa]], where she became worshipped as a [[goddess]].  Here she was found by [[Professor Charles Xavier]], who invited her to join his second team of X-Men.  Ororo accepted, taking the code-name Storm.

Although Storm initially had trouble adjusting to western culture, particularly the sort represented by her sometimes-vicious teammate [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Storm found a home among the X-Men.  Moreover, she revealed herself to be a capable leader, and became leader of the X-Men when its longtime leader, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], married and left the group.

Around this time, Storm went through some profound personal changes, including cutting her hair in a [[mohawk]] and wearing leather clothing.  She lost her powers for a while, though they were eventually restored.  She also fought [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] for leadership of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] and won, although the two bitter enemies eventually became uneasy allies.  She also had an on-again, off-again romance with the mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].

Later, she was transformed into a child and returned to stealing, when she met [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].  She brought him to the team and was restored to her adult state later in Genosha.  Storm also led the X-Men in the search for the [[Books of Truth]].  On this search, she enjoyed a brief flirtation with [[Slipstream]] and was kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (supervillain)|Khan]] who wanted to make her his queen. Despite being badly injured she was rescued and brought back to Earth to recover with Wolverine assisting her.
