'''Storm''' ('''Ororo Iqadi T'Challa''', née '''Munroe'''<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart #1'' by Christopher Yost, October 2008.</ref>) is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in a number of [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975),<ref name="giantsizexmen1">''Giant Size X-Men ''#1, 1975</ref> and was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]]. Best known as a longtime member and sometimes leader of the [[X-Men]], Storm is the reigning [[queen consort]] of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], a title held by marriage to King T'Challa, better known as the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

Storm is one of the most frequently used X-Men, having appeared in most of the comic books, all of animated television series, nearly all of the video games, and the [[X-Men (film series)|live-action ''X-Men'' film series]]. Storm is portrayed by [[Halle Berry]] in the first three films.

Storm was rated #8 on [[IGN]]'s list of The Top 25 X-Men.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/708/708826p4.html IGN's Top 25 X-Men List]</ref>

==Publication history==
===Origin of Storm (1970s)===
[[Image:giantsize1.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Cover to ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, 1975.  Art by [[Gil Kane]] & [[Dave Cockrum]]. Storm is flying in the top right-hand corner.]]
Storm first appeared in 1975 in the famous ''Giant Size X-Men'' #1 comic, written by Len Wein and pencilled by Dave Cockrum.  In this comic, Wein uses a battle against the living island [[Krakoa]] to replace the first-generation X-Men of the 1960s with new X-Men.<ref name="giantsizexmen1">''Giant Size X-Men'' #1, 1975</ref>  Storm was an amalgamation of several characters Cockrum intended to use for the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]''.  In a 1999 interview, Cockrum said that the original black female of the Legion would have been called The Black Cat.  According to him, she had Storm's costume but without the cape, and a cat-like haircut with tufts for ears.  However, other female cat characters like [[Tigra]] had appeared, so Cockrum redesigned his new character, giving her white hair and the cape, and created Storm.  When colleagues remarked that Storm’s white hair made her look like a grandmother, and thus, presumably unpopular, he just said: “Trust me.”<ref>{{cite web

[[Chris Claremont]], who followed up Wein as the writer of the flagship title ''Uncanny X-Men'' in 1975, embraced Storm and started writing many notable X-Men stories, among them ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'' and ''[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]'', which respectively served as the basis for the films ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.  In both arcs, Storm is written as a major supporting character.  This was a harbinger of things to come, as Claremont stayed the main writer of that comic book for the next 16 years and consequently wrote most of the publications containing Storm.

===Backstory===
In ''Uncanny X-Men #102'' (December 1976), Claremont established Storm's backstory.  Ororo's mother, N'Dare, is the princess of a tribe in [[Kenya]] and the descendant of a long line of African witch-priestesses with white hair, blue eyes, and a natural gift for [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  N'Dare falls in love with and marries [[United States|American]] [[photographer|photojournalist]] David Munroe.  They move to Harlem in uptown New York City, where she becomes pregnant with Ororo and bears her, and then to [[Egypt]] during the [[Suez Crisis]], where they are killed in a botched aircraft attack and leave six-year-old Ororo as an orphan. <!--Although the original version of this story stated that the bomb was dropped by a jet of the [[Israeli Air Force]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, later stories such as in ''Classic X-Men'' have revised the bombing first to an event of the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and then to an unnamed military conflict.-->   There, her violent [[claustrophobia]] is also established as a result of being buried under tons of rubble after that attack.  She then becomes a skilled thief in [[Cairo]] under the benign Achmed el-Gibar and wanders into the [[Serengeti]] as a young woman.  There, she is worshipped as a goddess before being recruited by [[Professor X]] for the X-Men.<ref name="uncannyxmen102">''Uncanny X-Men'' #102, Dec. 1976</ref>

Claremont further fleshed out Storm’s backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #117 (January 1979). He retroactively added that [[Professor X]], who recruits her in ''Giant Size X-Men'' #1 of 1975, had already met her as a child in Cairo.  As Ororo grows up on the streets and becomes a proficient thief under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar, one of her most notable victims was Charles Francis Xavier, later [[Professor X]].  He is able to use his mental powers to temporarily prevent her escape and recognizes the potential in her.  However, when Xavier is attacked mentally by Amahl Farouk, the [[Shadow King]], the two men are preoccupied enough with their battle to allow the girl to escape.  Both Xavier and the Shadow King recognize Storm as the young girl later.<ref name="uncannyxmen117"/>

===Punk revival (1980s)===
In the following issues, Claremont portrayed Storm as a serene, independent character. Although Storm was initially written having trouble adjusting to [[Western culture]], e.g. calling the obligation to cover herself up in a public bath "absurd,"<ref name="uncannyxmen109">''Uncanny X-Men'' #109, Feb 1978</ref> she earns a lot of respect: in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #139 (November 1980), Claremont established her as the leader of the X-Men after Cyclops took a leave of absence,<ref name="uncannyxmen139">''Uncanny X-Men'' #139, Nov. 1980</ref> a position she holds in various incarnations.  Claremont also made Storm especially harbor motherly feelings for the youngest X-Man, 13-year old [[Kitty Pryde]].  In ''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (December 1980), Claremont wrote a short story in which he retroactively established that Storm, then 12 years old, saves a young [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] from racist thugs when they both are in [[Kenya]].<ref name="marvelteamup100">''Marvel Team-Up'' #100, Dec. 1980</ref>  This story would later become a base for later writers to establish a deeper relationship between both characters.<ref name="cbrmarriage">{{cite web

In ''X-Men Annual'' #5, the X-Men travel with the Fantastic Four to help [[Arkon]] the Imperion defeat lizard-like [[Badoon]] invaders who had taken over his kingdom.  Storm and Arkon share a kiss at the end of the issue, as she turns down his offer to make her his queen.

In the early eighties, adventures of Storm written by Claremont included a [[space opera]] arc, in which the X-Men fight parasitic beings called the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].  Storm is infected with a Brood egg and contemplates suicide, but then experiences a last-minute save by the benign whale-like [[Acanti]] aliens.<ref name="uncannyxmen162166">''Uncanny X-Men'' #162-#166, Sept. 1982-Feb. 1983</ref>  In the following arc, Claremont further established Storm's character strength.  He wrote a story in which Storm's fellow X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] is abducted by a rogue [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] group called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].  The X-Men are hopelessly outnumbered, and Storm is rendered sick by the Morlock called [[Plague (comics)|Plague]].  Only one solution is left; an X-Man must defeat the Morlock's leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] in a duel to the death.  At first, Storm's colleague, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], wants to battle her, but Storm states that since she leads the X-Men, she must fight Callisto.  Despite being violently sick, she defeats Callisto by impaling her through the heart and nearly kills her.<ref name="uncannyxmen169170">''Uncanny X-Men'' #169-170, May–June 1983</ref>

[[Image:Storm22.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Storm's debut in her punk look and attitude. Art by Paul Smith, who called it "a bad joke."<ref name="celeb20"/>]]

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #173, October 1983, a notable move was made by changing Storm's costume and appearance.  Writer Claremont and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]] created a new look, abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants, and changing her former veil of white hair into a punk [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]].<ref name="uncannyxmen173">''Uncanny X-Men'' #173, Oct. 1983</ref> In a 2008 interview, Smith regretted the change as "a bad joke gone too far&nbsp;... I knew that they were going to cut the hair, so as a joke I put a [[Mr. T]] mohawk on her&nbsp;... [editor] [[Louise Simonson]] said 'We're gonna get hung[sic] no matter what we do, so let's commit the crime!' So we went with the Mohawk&nbsp;... But once you get into the whole leather and stud thing it was a bad joke that got way out of hand."<ref name="celeb20">''Marvel Spotlight: Uncanny X-Men 500 Issues Celebration'', p. 20</ref>

In the actual story, Storm's outlook on life darkens after her struggles with the Brood.  These changes alienate her from [[Kitty Pryde|Kitty]] for a time.  Storm is influenced in this by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], a friend of Wolverine, and the two become fast friends.<ref name="YukioStorm">{{cite web|url=http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32|title=Tegneserier: An interview with Chris Claremont|work=Serie Journalen|last1=Sørensen|first1=Tue|last2=Kristiansen|first2=Ulrik|date=May 1, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref><!--Do NOT add that Storm and Yukio became "lovers".  While it has been suggested by fans, in an interview, Claremont discussed that Yukio and Storm as lovers never crossed his mind when writing them, compared to Colleen Wing and Misty Knight.  Since the story lines were under Claremont at the time, it is incorrect to claim they became lovers.  Continuing to add it here is vandalism.--> Claremont wrote an arc in which fellow mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] develops a mutant power neutralizing gun.  The intended target is another X-Man, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who because of her criminal history and a recent encounter with some [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, is believed to be a terrorist.  When the shady U.S. government operative [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] aims at Rogue, he accidentally hits Storm, taking away her powers.  Forge saves Storm from death and takes her back to his home in [[Dallas, Texas]] to recover.  With his help, she adjusts to life without her powers, and they slowly fall in love.  Later, Storm overhears a phone conversation between Forge and Gyrich, and discovers Forge built the weapon that took her powers.  She is heartbroken and leaves him.<ref name="uncannyxmen185186">''Uncanny X-Men'' #185-186, 1984</ref>

However, Claremont continued to write her as a strong character, letting a depowered Storm win against [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] for the leadership of the X-Men in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #201 (1986).<ref name="uncannyxmen201">''Uncanny X-Men'' #201, 1986</ref>  In the late eighties, Claremont wrote arcs in which Storm, again portrayed with a costume and hairstyle closer to her original, temporarily joins the insidious [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] (1987),<ref name="newmutants51">''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #51, 1987</ref> is trapped in another dimension with Forge and regains her elemental powers,<ref name="uncannyxmen225227">''Uncanny X-Men'' #225-227, Jan.-March 1988</ref> and is captured by the evil cyborg [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]].<ref name="uncannyxmen248">''Uncanny X-Men'' #248, Sept. 1989</ref>  Although believed slain in that encounter, she resurfaced, having become amnesiac as a result of being physically regressed to childhood by Nanny.  She is hunted by the evil telepath [[Shadow King]] and framed for murder,<ref name="uncannyxmen253257">''Uncanny X-Men'' #253-257, Nov. 1989-Jan. 1990</ref> and finally returns to thieving before regaining her memories.<ref name="uncannyxmen265267">''Uncanny X-Men'' #265-267, Aug-Sept 1990</ref>  In the following arc, ''[[X-Men: X-Tinction Agenda|The X-Tinction Agenda]]'', she is kidnapped to the mutant-exploiting fictional nation of [[Genosha]] and is temporarily transformed into a brainwashed mutate, but is in the end restored physically and mentally to her adult prime.<ref name="uncannyxmen270271">''Uncanny X-Men'' #270-271, 1991</ref>

===Growth as a character (1990s)===
In October 1991, the ''X-Men'' franchise was re-launched, centering on the new eponymous ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) comic.  Claremont wrote Storm as the leader of the X-Men's Gold Team; the other team, Blue, is led by her colleague [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], the X-Man she once succeeded as leader.  When Claremont left the X-Men comic after 16 years since his debut in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #94 (1975),<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #3, Dec. 1991, was the last ''X-Men'' comic Chris Claremont wrote after 16 consecutive years</ref> he was replaced by [[Jim Lee]], who continued portraying her as a strong leader.  In the sister title ''Uncanny X-Men'', now under [[Scott Lobdell]], Lobdell continued on the romance between Storm and Forge eventually having Forge propose to Storm in 1992.  Storm hesitates and is about to say yes when Forge misinterprets her reaction and rescinds his offer before Storm can speak.<ref name="uncannyxmen289290">''Uncanny X-Men'' #289-290, June 1992</ref>  Lobdell waited until November 1993 before he let a deeply hurt Storm and Forge make up with each other.<ref name="uncannyxmen306">''Uncanny X-Men'' #306, Nov. 1993</ref>  In 1995, Lobdell continued with an arc which pitted the X-Men against the Morlocks again.  As Claremont did with Callisto in 1983, Lobdell let Storm end the battle by wounding her opponent in the heart.  This time, Storm rips out one heart of the two-hearted Morlock girl [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], who had fixed a bomb to it.<ref name="uncannyxmen325">''Uncanny X-Men'' #325, Oct. 1995</ref> In February 1996, Storm got her first miniseries, the eponymous ''Storm.''  In these four issues, Warren Ellis wrote a story in which Storm is sucked into an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] and pitted against villain [[Mikhail Rasputin]].<ref name="storm14">''Storm'' #1-4, Feb-May 1996</ref>

===Contemporary Storm (2000s)===
In ''[[X-Treme X-Men]],'' conceived by a newly-reinstated Chris Claremont in July 2001, Storm was written as the leader of this team of more streetwise X-Men, including the former thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], former [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] member [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], anti-hero [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]], and the more tame [[Neal Shaara|third hero known as Thunderbird]].  This was in contrast to its more strait-laced sister titles, ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''New X-Men.''  In the period until its end in issue #46 (June 2004), Claremont continued to write Storm as the central character.  During this time, Storm enjoys a brief flirtation with younger fellow X-Man [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]] and is kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (comics)|Khan]].  Khan wants to make her his queen, but Storm defeats him.  In the series, she also becomes leader of the fictional [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]], a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority.<ref name="xtremexmen146">''X-Treme X-Men'' #1-46, July 2001-June 2004</ref>

In the aftermath of the 2005 ''[[House of M]]'' storyline (written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]]), [[Decimation (comics)|90% of the mutants lost their powers]].  Storm is among the [[Decimation (comics)#Confirmed remaining mutants|198]] mutants who retain their powers.<ref name="houseofm">''[[House of M]]'', 2005</ref>  Also in that year, the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm'' of Mark Sumerak retold her backstory in greater detail, concentrating on her relationship with surrogate father figure Achmed el-Gibar during her childhood.<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14">''Ororo: Before the Storm'' #1-4, Aug-Nov 2005</ref>
[[Image:Stormbpmarriage.PNG|thumb|175px|The marriage of Storm and the Black Panther. Front cover for ''Black Panther'' #18 (2006), by Frank Cho.]]  In the following year, Marvel Comics announced that Ororo would marry fellow African super hero [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

Storm later joins the reformed ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' (#25). She states that her official reason for joining the team is that Wakanda is a supporter of Mutantes Sans Frontieres and she believes she should be on the front line, however she is also somewhat bored of her life as queen.  The reemergence of the Shadow King later forces Storm to choose between her role as queen and her role as an X-Man.  Confronting the Panther God Bast, Storm asserts that she is not limited to being one or the other or anything else and that she is unafraid to do whatever is necessary to fulfill those responsibilities.  Regaining Bast's favor, the two defeat the Shadow King and Storm decides that she will remain Queen of Wakanda and remain with the X-Men, refusing to choose between them.<ref>''X-Men: Worlds Apart 1-4''</ref>

==Historical significance==
{{See also|African characters in comics}}
Storm was one of the first black comic book characters, and the first black female, to play either a major or supporting role in the big two comic book houses, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]].  Within these two companies, her 1975 debut was only preceded by a few male black characters.  In Marvel Comics, preceding characters were [[Gabe Jones]] (debuted in 1963), [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] (1966), [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] (1966), ''[[Spider-Man]]'' supporting characters [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|Joe Robertson]] (1967), his son [[Randy Robertson|Randy]] (1968), [[Prowler (comics)|Hobie Brown (the Prowler)]] & [[Falcon (comics)|The Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972), [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) and [[Sons of the Tiger|Abe Brown]] (1974).  In DC Comics, she was preceded by ''[[Teen Titans]]'' member [[Mal Duncan]] who debuted in 1970, ''[[Green Lantern]]'' wielder [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] (1971), and [[Mister Miracle]] protégé [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]] (1973); she preceded DC's other black heroes, ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' member [[Tyroc]] (who debuted in 1976), [[Black Lightning]] (1977), [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] (1980), [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] (1981) and [[Amazing Man]] (1983).  While not the first black character to be introduced, since her creation, Storm has remained the most successful and recognizable black superhero.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Fictional character biography==<!--STRICT adherence to WP:WAF!!-->
Ever since her inception in 1975, Storm's biography has largely stayed the same.  The framework was laid first by Chris Claremont, who fleshed out her backstory in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #102 (1976)<ref name="uncannyxmen102"/> and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #117 (1979).<ref name="uncannyxmen117">''Uncanny X-Men'' #117, Jan. 1979</ref> Some reinterpretations were made in 2005 and 2006, where writers Mark Sumerak and Eric Jerome Dickey, respectively, rewrote part of her early history in the miniseries ''Ororo: Before the Storm''<ref name="ororobeforethestorm14">''Ororo: Before the Storm'' #1-4, Aug-Nov 2005, Marvel Comics, writer Mark Sumerak</ref> and ''Storm'' (vol. 2).<ref name="storm16">''Storm'' (vol. 2) #1-6 miniseries, Apr-Nov 2006</ref>

According to established Marvel canon, Ororo Munroe is born in [[New York City]] as the child of Kenyan tribal princess N’Dare and American photographer David Munroe. When Ororo is six months old, she and her parents move to the Egyptian capital of [[Cairo]]. Five years later, during the [[Suez Crisis]], a fighter jet crashes into her parents’ house, killing them.  Buried under tons of rubble, Ororo survives but is [[orphan]]ed and left with intense [[claustrophobia]]. Her fear was once so intense that she was known to revert to a fetal position and approach a [[catatonic state]].<ref name="uncannyxmen102"/> (In recent years, Storm has more or less conquered her claustrophobia,<ref>"I may not like confined spaces, but it's been a long time since a wooden box could hold me, so all you've done is made me mad."

==Powers and abilities==
===Weather control===
Storm is an extremely powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and has demonstrated a plethora of abilities, most of which are facets of her power to [[Weather control|control the weather]].<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

Storm possesses the [[Psionics|psionic]] ability to control all forms of [[weather]] over vast areas.  She has been able to control both Earthly and extraterrestrial ecosystems on several occasions. She can control the temperature of the environment, control all forms of precipitation, humidity and moisture (at a molecular level), generate lightning and other electromagnetic atmospheric phenomena, and has demonstrated excellent control over [[atmospheric pressure]]. She can incite all forms of meteorological tempests, such as [[tornado]]es, [[thunderstorm]]s, [[blizzard]]s, and  [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s,<ref>She is able to "summon the softest breeze or the most torrential hurricane." Syd Barney-Hawke's ''Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 2: X-Men''. [[Marvel Comics]]. (2003-04-01). Retrieved on 2008-04-19. ISBN 078-5111999.</ref> as well as [[mist]]. She can dissipate such weather to form clear skies as well.

Her precise control over the atmosphere allows her to create special weather effects. She can create precipitation at higher or lower altitudes than normal, make whirlwinds travel pointing lengthwise in any direction, channel ambient [[electromagnetism]] through her body to generate electric blasts, [[Flash freezing|flash freeze]] objects and people, coalesce atmospheric pollutants into [[acid rain]] or [[toxic]] [[fog]], and summon [[wind current]]s strong enough to support her weight to elevate herself to fly at high altitudes and speeds. Her control is so great that she can even manipulate the air in a person's lungs. She can also control the pressure inside the human inner ear, an ability she uses to cause intense pain. She can also bend light using moisture in the air and her manipulation of mist and fog to appear partially transparent, and in later comics, nearly invisible.

Storm has also demonstrated the ability to control natural forces that include [[Space weather|cosmic storms]], [[solar wind]], [[ocean current]]s, and the [[electromagnetic field]]. She has demonstrated the ability to separate water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen via [[electrolysis]], allowing her to breathe underwater.<ref>{{Cite comic

}}</ref> While in outer space, she is able to affect and manipulate the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. Storm can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe in terms of energy patterns, detecting the flow of kinetic, thermal and electromagnetic energy behind weather phenomena and can bend this energy to her will.

Storm has shown to be sensitive to the dynamics of the natural world, and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. She has sensed a diseased and dying tree on the [[X-Mansion]] grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums—including water, and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet's magnetosphere.<ref>#29</ref> Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' Vol. 3 #34</ref> Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body.  [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] identify Storm as a possible [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)#Omega-level mutants|Omega-level mutant]].<ref>''Black Panther'' #21</ref>

===Magical potential===
Storm's ancestry supports the use of magic and [[witchcraft]].<ref name="Tarot">''The Marvel Tarot'' Direct Edition One Shot, June 2007</ref>  Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses.  Storm's matrilineal powers have even been linked to the ''real-world'' [[Rain Queen]]s of Balobedu, the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor, Ayesha, hails.  The [[Mystic Arcana]] series deals with Storm's ancestor Ashake, who worships the Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], also known as [[Oshtur (Marvel Comics)|Oshtur]] — the mother of [[Agamotto]].<ref>''Mystic Arcana'' (vol. 1) #1</ref>  Oshtur appears to have strong favor for the bloodline of Ororo.{{issue|date=December 2010}} For some unknown reason, since the dawn of Atlantis, this line of African women has been given distinguishing features of white hair, blue eyes, and powerful magic potential.{{issue|date=December 2010}} Although Storm has not developed her magical potential, it has been hinted at.<ref name="Tarot"/>  The Mystic Arcana series lists the characters with magic potential according to the Marvel Tarot deck.  The Tarot asserts Storm as being "High Priestess," the First Tarot's choice one-third of the time.  The other draws were the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Agatha Harkness]].  These three characters split the High Priestess card equally.  A timeline-divergent Storm became the sorceress who taught sorcery to [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] and some of Storm's alternate universe selves possess considerable magical talent.<ref>{{Comic book reference

===Combat and thievery===
Storm is an expert thief, and a skilled, cunning and gifted hand-to-hand fighter, trained by Achmed el-Gibar, Professor X, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and T'Challa, the Black Panther.  By using superior strategy, Storm has overcome physically stronger foes like [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and the [[Crimson Commando]] in hand-to-hand combat. Storm is an excellent marksman with handguns, and is proficient in the use of knives. Storm is also fluent in Russian, Arabic and Swahili.  As part of her paraphernalia, Storm carries a set of lock-picks (with which she has an extraordinary ability at picking locks, in an early appearance she was able to pick a lock with her teeth while physically and mentally reduced to the level of an infant<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #112</ref>) and her ancestral ruby, which allows inter-dimensional transportation with the help of her lightning.<ref name="officalmarvelpage"/>

===Physical abilities and traits===
Storm's physiology grants her a total immunity to extreme weather conditions and temperatures of heat and cold.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #121</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #165</ref>  Her body compensates for rapid decreases or increases in atmospheric pressure.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #32</ref>  She can see in near-complete darkness and has superb dexterity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #113</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #151-152</ref>  Storm has been described as having one of the strongest wills among the X-Men, making her highly resistant to psychic attacks especially in tandem with electrical fields she creates around herself.  Telepaths have found it difficult to track her down and probe her thoughts.  Several of these traits are independent of her mutant status and are a result of her ancestry. Also, when utilizing her powers, Storm's eyes turn solid white.<ref name="officalmarvelpage"/>
