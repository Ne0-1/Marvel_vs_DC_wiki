'''Storm''' (Ororo Munroe) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and a prominent member of the [[X-Men]].  She first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May [[1975]]).  She has the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] power to control the [[weather]], including striking objects with [[lightning]], summoning [[wind]], [[rain]] and [[snow]], and using the wind to fly.

==History==
<!-- I'm not sure her early years are accurately reflected here. -->

Ororo's mother, N'Dare, was the princess of a tribe in [[Kenya]] and the descendant of a long line of white-haired, blue-eyed [[witch]]es.  N'Dare fell in love with and married [[United States|American]] [[photographer|photojournalist]] David Munroe.  Ororo was born in [[Manhattan]] in the [[United States]], and when Ororo was six months old, she and her parents moved to [[Cairo, Egypt]].  Five years later, a [[bomb]] destroyed their home and killed Ororo's parents; although the original version of this story stated that the bomb was dropped by an [[Israel]]i [[jet]] during the [[Suez Crisis]], later stories have revised the bombing to an unnamed military conflict.  Ororo was trapped in the collapsed building alongside her dead mother, a [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic experience that would ultimately leave her with a severe case of [[claustrophobia]].  Ororo grew up on the streets and became a proficient [[thief]] under the tutelage of master thief Achmed el-Gibar.

As a teenager, she proved to be a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the power to control the [[weather]].  Reaching maturity, she moved deeper into [[Africa]], where she became worshipped as a [[goddess]].  Here she was found by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], who invited her to join his second team of X-Men.  Ororo accepted, taking the code-name Storm.

Although Storm initially had trouble adjusting to [[Western culture]], particularly the sort represented by her sometimes-vicious teammate [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Storm found a home and family among the X-Men.  Moreover, she revealed herself to be a capable leader, and became leader of the X-Men when its longtime leader, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], married and left the group.

Around this time, Storm went through some profound personal changes, including cutting her hair in a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and wearing [[leather]] clothing.  She lost her powers for a while, though they were eventually restored.  She also fought [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] for leadership of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] and won, although the two bitter enemies eventually became uneasy allies.  She also had an on-again, off-again romance with the mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].

Later, she was transformed into a child and returned to stealing, when she met [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].  She brought him to the team and was restored to her adult state later in Genosha.  Storm also led the X-Men in the search for [[Destiny (Marvel Comics)|Destiny]]'s [[diary|diaries]], the Books of Truth.  On this search, she enjoyed a brief flirtation with [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]] and was kidnapped by the intergalactic warlord [[Khan (supervillain)|Khan]] who wanted to make her his queen. Despite being badly injured, she was rescued and brought back to Earth to recover by Wolverine.  She has since rejoined the main team of X-Men.
