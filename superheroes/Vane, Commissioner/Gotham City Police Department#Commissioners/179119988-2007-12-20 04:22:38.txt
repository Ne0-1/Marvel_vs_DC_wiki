The '''Gotham City Police Department''' (GCPD) is a fictional police department servicing the city of [[Gotham City]] in the [[DC Universe]].

==History of GCPD==

Acting as both ally and opponent of [[Batman]], the superhero long-established in Gotham, the GCPD has long been steeped in [[Political corruption|corruption]], with numerous officers both high-and-low ranking involved in bribery and even more serious offences such as drug-trafficking and murder.

The strongest blow against [[police corruption]] came when an increasing amount of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges against [[Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] forced him to [[resign]] his position. The Falcone crime family, which had had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled when a series of killings shook the structure of the [[mafia]] [[organization]]. After the death of [[Carmine Falcone]], the mob lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes, which, in combination with rising gang violence, severely crippled [[organized crime]] in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corrupt police officers allowed [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to become the new commissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed.

The GCPD has had a long [[love-hate relationship]] with the city's [[vigilante]] known as [[Batman]]. Commissioner Gordon went along with him because Batman got the job done. His successor, Commissioner [[Michael Akins]] ordered the arrest of Batman and had the [[Bat-signal]] removed from the roof of [[Gotham Central]]. Corruption and rot within the police department also rose during Akins' tenure as Commissioner.

==Current status of GCPD==

As of DC's ''One Year Later'', James Gordon has been reinstated as Commissioner, along with [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] who came back on disciplinary probation after helping expose a criminal drug ring, rejoining the force and the reinstatement of the Bat-Signal and relations with Batman. Other characters from ''[[Gotham Central]]'' have appeared in the recent ''[[Tales of the Unexpected]]'' miniseries, featuring [[Crispus Allen]] as the [[Spectre (comics)#Crispus Allen|Spectre]]. Thus far, Detective Driver has appeared in a speaking role, and characters resembling Stacy and Romy Chandler were seen in Issue #4 (January, 2007). It is unknown what has happened to Commissioner Akins, but it is implied that, following revelations of massive corruption within the department, there has been a drastic cleaning-of-house within the department. 

[[Kate Kane]] referred to Akins as police commissioner in the weekly ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, which reveals the events of the missing year. A later issue, however, showed a brief snapshot of Commissioner Gordon's welcome back party. The circumstances of Akins's departure and Gordon's reinstatement have yet to be explained.  [[Maggie Sawyer]] is still the commander of the MCU department, and has ended her relationship with former lover [[Maggie Sawyer|Toby Raines]].

==In other media==
===Serials===
All other depictions of Batman have portrayed the Gotham City Police Department in some form or another. The 1940s [[Batman serials]] has actor [[Lyle Talbot]] in the role of Commissioner Gordon in each one. No other members of the force are shown. However, his appearance of Gordon having a feather-duster mustache was later adapted to the comics. Interestingly enough, he portrayed [[Lex Luthor]] in the [[Kirk Alyn]] serial ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]''.

===''Batman (TV series)''===
The 1960s [[campy]] [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] featured [[Neil Hamilton]] as Gordon and [[Stafford Repp]] as Chief O'Hara. Both are depicted as being dependant on Batman and Robin to solve the cases, whereas the clues are easy to discover and interept. Gordon even keeps a link to the Batcave called "the Batphone" on his desk. In one episode, when Batman appears to be missing, Gordon laments that the police will have to solve a case "ourselves."

===1989-1997 live action films===
All the [[Tim Burton]]/[[Joel Schumacher]] series seemed to give little depiction on the GCPD at all. In ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Gordon is portrayed by [[Pat Hingle]], while the usually corrupt Harvey Bullock is replaced with [[William Hootkins]]' [[Lt. Max Eckhart]], who is killed by [[The Joker|Jack Napier]] prior to his accidental transformation. Hingle also appeared in ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'', and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.

===''Batman: The Animated Series''===
In the acclaimed [[animated television series]], ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the GCPD characters are given more attention such as in "P.O.V," where the major characters of the force in the series participate in a detailed debriefing of an incident. One of the most important contributions from the animated series to the Batman universe is the introduction of [[Renee Montoya]] (first as a uniformed constable, then a detective), which would later become a first-grade character in the ''GCPD'' comic books. In the printed [[DC Universe]], her presence was so solidly incorporated that she later retired from the Department to assume the identity of [[Question (comics)|the Question]].

===''Batman Begins''===
The [[reboot]] of the Batman film franchise, ''[[Batman Begins]]'', has the GCPD play a pivotal role during the course of the film. While Jim Gordon (played by [[Gary Oldman]]) is the major officer, others from the comics play a role as well. [[Mark Boone Junior]] plays Detective Flass as dealing with the local [[mob|mafia]], and Colin MacFarlane appears as the staunchly vigilante-opposed Commissioner Loeb. Although Flass is shown to be corrupt, Loeb does not seem to be corrupted yet, but he is clearly displeased with the arrival of Batman. This is demonstrated by him calling a SWAT team to capture him; a scene which is lifted from the ''Year One'' comic.

===''The Batman''===
On the animated series [[The Batman (TV series)|''The Batman'']], the focus of the GCPD in the first two seasons is on Detectives [[Ellen Yin]] and (prior to his [[Clayface]] transformation) [[Ethan Bennett]]. The corruption on the force is attributed to Chief [[Angel Rojas]], who appeared often in those seasons. However, in the Season 2 finale, [[Jim Gordon]], recently appointed Commissioner, calls off the manhunt and forms an alliance with Batman to help keep Gotham safe for his daughter, Barbara. Neither Rojas or Yin has been seen since then, though [[Artifacts (The Batman)|one episode that take places in the future]] implies that sometime between now and then, Yin will replace Gordon as Commissioner.

===Alternate officers of the law===

:*'''[[Chief O’Hara]]''', played by [[Stafford Repp]].
*''Batman'' (1989 film)
