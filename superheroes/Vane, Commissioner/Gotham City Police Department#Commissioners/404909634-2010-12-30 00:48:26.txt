The '''Gotham City Police Department''' (GCPD) is a [[fiction]]al [[Police|police department]] servicing [[Gotham City]], as depicted in comic books published by [[DC Comics]], in particular those tied into the [[Batman]] books.

==History of GCPD==
Acting as both ally and opponent of [[Batman]], the superhero long-established in Gotham, the GCPD has long been steeped in [[Political corruption|corruption]], with numerous officers both high-and-low ranking involved in bribery and even more serious offenses such as drug-trafficking and murder.

The strongest blow against [[police corruption]] came when an increasing amount of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges against [[Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] forced him to [[resign]] his position, replaced by Peter Grogan. The Falcone crime family, which had had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled when a series of killings shook the structure of the [[mafia]] [[organization]]. After the death of [[Carmine Falcone]], the mob lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes, which, in combination with rising gang violence, severely crippled [[organized crime]] in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corrupt police officers allowed [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to become the new commissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed.

The GCPD has had a long [[love-hate relationship]] with the city's [[vigilante]] known as [[Batman]]. Commissioner Gordon went along with him because Batman got the job done. His successor, Commissioner [[Michael Akins]] ordered the arrest of Batman and had the [[Bat-signal]] removed from the roof of [[Gotham Central]]. Corruption and rot within the police department also rose during Akins' tenure as Commissioner.

==Current status of GCPD==
As of DC's ''One Year Later'', James Gordon has been reinstated as Commissioner, along with [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]]. Harvey came back on disciplinary probation after helping expose a criminal drug ring. Relation with Batman, including the Bat-Signal, have been established once more. Other characters from ''[[Gotham Central]]'' have appeared in the recent ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' miniseries, featuring [[Crispus Allen]] as the [[Spectre (comics)#Crispus Allen|Spectre]]. Thus far, Detective Driver has appeared in a speaking role. It is unknown what has happened to Commissioner Akins, but it is implied that, following revelations of massive corruption within the department, there has been a drastic cleaning-of-house within the department.

[[Kate Kane]] referred to Akins as police commissioner in the weekly ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, which reveals the events of the missing year. A later issue, however, showed a brief snapshot of Commissioner Gordon's welcome back party. The circumstances of Akins's departure and Gordon's reinstatement have yet to be explained.  [[Maggie Sawyer]] is still the commander of the MCU department, and has ended her relationship with former lover Toby Raines.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Commissioners==
*'''Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb''' — The corrupt commissioner of police during the first year of Batman’s operation in Gotham. In [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Loeb was a legitimate cop who was murdered by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] when poison was put into his drink. 

*'''Commissioner Jack Grogan''' - he was Commissioner after Loeb and before Gordon. He was mentioned in the last page of Miller's ''Batman: Year One'' and has a one panel appearance in the ''Catwoman Year One Annual'' and also in ''Batman: The Man Who Laughs'' and ''Batman and the Monster Men'' #1.

*'''Commissioner James Gordon''' — Replaced Grogan and worked with Batman in trying to clean up the Gotham police department. When he retired, he handed the GCPD over to Michael Akins, only to take the job back some years later. The adoptive father of Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl and later Oracle.

*'''Commissioner Vane'''- Former Chief Inspector, only served as commissioner briefly when Gordon was demoted to patrolman in ''Detective Comics'' #121.  During his brief tenure, he oversaw Dr. Hurt's experiments.

*'''Commissioner Peter Pauling''' — Another corrupt commissioner, appointed by Mayor Hamilton Hill. Like Hill, he was working for Rupert Thorne. Pauling issued a shoot-to-kill order for any police officer who spotted Batman, and secretly tried to have Gordon, who was working as a private detective, killed. Pauling eventually died at Thorne's hands and a desperate Mayor Hill re-instated Commissioner Gordon. Pauling may not have existed in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|Post-Crisis]] DC universe.

*'''Commissioner Sarah Essen Gordon''' — The wife of James Gordon, appointed Commissioner by Mayor Krol while her husband was demoted. This put a great strain on her relationship with her husband and they split up for a while.  Although she had previously been a critic of the Batman, she agreed to Mayor Krol's instructions that she use him.  Mayor Krol sacked her after he lost his re-election bid against Marion Grange, replacing her with Andy Howe.

*'''Commissioner Andy Howe''' — A lawyer who served briefly as Commissioner during the lame-duck Mayoralty of Armand Krol. (''Detective Comics'' #693, January 1996) When the "Clench" virus was released in Gotham and the city descended into anarchy, most police officers ignored Howe and took orders from James Gordon, at that point a private citizen. Howe lost his job when Marion Grange became Mayor and immediately re-instated James Gordon. (''Robin'' #28, April 1996)

*'''Commissioner Michael Akins''' — Took over from James Gordon.  After the events of the [[Batman: War Games|War Games]] arc, Akins declared all vigilante actions were now illegal, and issued a shoot-to-kill order for any sight of Batman or his associates. He left the position under unspecified circumstance.

*'''Commissioner Ellen Yindel''' - Replaces Gordon in the non-canon ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]''. In the sequel, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', she resigns.

*'''Commissioner Tolliver''' - Police commissioner in the alternate 1889 of ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]''. He is mayor when Batman first emerges and defeats [[Jack the Ripper]]. Claiming the victory as his own, Tolliver is then elected mayor in the sequel, ''Master of the Future''.

==Gotham City FBI==
The '''Gotham City Federal Bureau of Investigation''' unit is also featured in the fictitious [[Gotham City]]. The Gotham City FBI drive black vehicles with red emergency lights.

==In other media==
===Serials===
All other depictions of Batman have portrayed the Gotham City Police Department in some form or another. The 1940s [[Batman (serial)|Batman serials]] has actor [[Lyle Talbot]] in the role of Commissioner Gordon in each one. No other members of the force are shown. However, his appearance of Gordon having a feather-duster mustache was later adapted to the comics. Interestingly enough, he portrayed [[Lex Luthor]] in the [[Kirk Alyn]] serial ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]''.

===''Batman (TV series)''===
The 1960s [[campy]] [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] featured [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]] as Gordon and [[Stafford Repp]] as Chief O'Hara. Both are depicted as being dependent on Batman and Robin to solve the cases, whereas the clues are easy to discover and interpret. Gordon even keeps a link to the [[Batcave]] called "the [[Batphone]]" on his desk. In one episode, when Batman appears to be missing, Gordon laments that the police will have to solve a case "ourselves."

===1989-1997 live action films===
All the [[Tim Burton]]/[[Joel Schumacher]] series seemed to give little depiction on the GCPD at all. In ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Gordon is portrayed by [[Pat Hingle]], while the usually corrupt Harvey Bullock is replaced with [[William Hootkins]]' [[Max Eckhardt|Lt. Max Eckhart]] (who is killed by [[Joker (comics)|Jack Napier]] prior to his accidental transformation). Hingle also appeared in ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'', and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.

===''Batman: The Animated Series''===
In the acclaimed [[animated television series]], ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the GCPD characters are given more attention such as in "P.O.V", where the major characters of the force in the series participate in a detailed debriefing of an incident. One of the most important contributions from the animated series to the Batman universe is the introduction of [[Renee Montoya]] (first as a uniformed constable, then a detective), which would later become a first-grade character in the ''GCPD'' comic books. In the printed [[DC Universe]], her presence was so solidly incorporated that she later retired from the Department to assume the identity of [[Question (comics)|the Question]].

===''Batman Beyond''===
In this animated series, James Gordon's daughter, Barbara Gordon (former Batgirl in ''Batman: The Animated Series'') is the new commissioner.

===''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight''===
The [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''Batman'' film franchise, ''[[Batman Begins]]'', has the GCPD play a pivotal role during the course of the film. Jim Gordon (played by [[Gary Oldman]]) is the main focus but others play a role as well. Some are original characters, some are from the comics. [[Mark Boone Junior]] plays Detective Flass as dealing with the local [[mafia]], and [[Colin McFarlane]] appears as the staunchly vigilante-opposed Commissioner Loeb. Although Flass is shown to be corrupt, Loeb does not seem to be, but he is clearly displeased with the arrival of Batman. This is demonstrated by him calling a SWAT team to capture him; a scene which is lifted from the ''Year One'' comic.

The film's sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', features the GCPD extensively. According to the viral marketing campaign for the film, [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] spearheads an initiative through his office to rid the department of corruption. Also, in response of The League of Shadows' attack from the first film, Commissioner Loeb set up the Major Crimes Unit within Gotham PD to counter possible terrorist attacks alongside riding the city's organized crime. James Gordon is put in charge of the unit.  The police have also cooled their animosity towards Batman. The official investigation has jokingly placing Elvis, Abe Lincoln, and Bigfoot on their wall of suspects for Batman. Commissioner Loeb is murdered  by the Joker, leading to his replacement by Gordon.

Also featured are three detectives, Stephens (played by [[Keith Szarabajka]]), Wuertz (played by [[Ron Dean]]) and Anna Ramirez (played by [[Monique Curnen]]). While Stephens is a good and honest cop, he is not without faults: while he deliberately keeps Gordon's fake death a secret, his short temper leads to him starting a fight with the Joker in his cell; the Joker subdues Stephens and uses him as a hostage to escape from prison (although Stephens survives the ordeal). Wuertz and Ramirez, however, are corrupt and involved with the mob. Dent was gathering evidence against Ramirez and Wuertz whom he suspected was corrupt when he was working for Internal Affairs. Wuertz and Ramirez help the Joker kidnap [[Rachel Dawes]] and [[Harvey Dent]]. Dawes dies due to the Joker's plans. Wuertz shows no remorse, but Ramirez actually feels devastated for it, as it is revealed that she only wanted the bribes to help pay for her sick mother's hospital fees. Dent, now scarred and going by the name "Two-Face", confronts both. A flip of the coin secures Wuertz's death but leads to Ramirez simply being punched out. Batman and Gordon find Dent, and Batman is forced to kill Dent to save Gordon's (obviously innocent) son. They concoct a plan for Batman himself to accept the blame for the deaths of Dent's victims, so that all the good Harvey did will stand. The police subsequently ignite a manhunt for Batman.

====''Batman: Gotham Knight''====
Gordon, Ramirez, and Crispus Allen all appear in three of the shorts in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', which bridges the gap between ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight''; ''[[Crossfire (Batman: Gotham Knight)|Crossfire]]'', ''[[In Darkness Dwells]]'', and ''[[Deadshot (Batman: Gotham Knight)|Deadshot]]''.

Gordon was voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]], Ramirez was voiced by [[Ana Ortiz]], and Allen was voiced by [[Gary Dourdan]].

While Gordon resembles how he was portrayed in ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', both Flass and Loeb resemble, respectively, Harvey Bullock and Michael Akins rather than their comic book counterparts. It's been speculated and comments made on the commentary track of ''Batman: Gotham Knight'' seem to hint that Ramirez is loosely inspired by Renee Montoya.

===''The Batman''===
On the animated series [[The Batman (TV series)|''The Batman'']], the focus of the GCPD in the first two seasons is on Detectives [[Ellen Yin]] and (prior to his [[Clayface]] transformation) [[Ethan Bennett]]. The corruption on the force is attributed to Chief Angel Rojas, who appeared often in those seasons. However, in the Season 2 finale, [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], recently appointed Commissioner, calls off the manhunt and forms an alliance with Batman to help keep Gotham safe for his daughter, Barbara. Neither Rojas nor Yin has been seen since then, though [[Artifacts (The Batman)|one episode that take places in the future]] implies that sometime between now and then, Yin will replace Gordon as Commissioner and Bennet becomes Chief of Police.

===Alternate officers of the law===
*''Batman'' (1960s TV show) 
:*'''[[Chief Miles O'Hara|Chief O'Hara]]''', played by [[Stafford Repp]].
*''Batman'' (1989 film) 
:*'''[[Lt. Max Eckhardt|Lieutenant Max Eckhardt]]''', played by [[William Hootkins]]. A corrupt cop echoing some of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] aspects of Harvey Bullock. 
*''Birds of Prey'' (TV series from 2002–2003)
:*'''Detective Jesse Reese''' - Was played by [[Shemar Moore]]. Is an honest cop in New Gotham who learns of the Birds of Prey and begins to help them. He later enters into a relationship with Huntress.  It is later revealed that Reese's birthname was Jesse Hawke, son of crime boss Al Hawke, who became a police officer to atone his family's sins. This version of the GCPD does have a corruption problem (though it is unclear how bad since a few other honest officers have cameos) and appears to no longer have Jim Gordon at its head. 
*''The Batman'' (TV series from 2004–2008)
:*'''Chief Angel Rojas''' — [[Edward James Olmos]] and [[Jesse Corti]] provide his voice for this show. For Chief Rojas, The Batman is nothing less than a black eye to his police force. Believing there is no room for vigilante justice in Gotham, Rojas has made capturing the Dark Knight a top priority.
:*'''Detective [[Ellen Yin]]''' — [[Ming-Na]] provides her voice in this show.  Given her name and the events of the episode, ''Artifacts'', she could be a loose adaptation of Ellen Yindel from ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]''.
:*'''Detective [[Ethan Bennett]]''' — He is a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne's. Due to a chemical created by the Joker, he becomes the first Clayface for this series. [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]] provides his voice.
:*'''Detective [[Cash Tankinson]]''' - He is a bumbling detective who was Yin's partner for the episode "JTV" and returned in the episode "[[Cash for Toys]]" as Bruce Wayne's personal bodyguard, voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]].
*''The Dark Knight'' (2008 film)
:*'''Detective Anna Ramirez''' - Played by Monique Curnen, she is a corrupt cop involved in the scarring of Harvey Dent and the death of Rachel Dawes by the Joker.  She also appeared in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Ana Ortiz]].  The commentary on the ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' DVD, indicates she might be loosely inspired by Renee Montoya.  She received a head injury from Dent after he cracked her head with the bottom of his gun, and later implied from Gordon that she didn't survive her trauma, though she might not have regained consciousness yet.  
:*'''Detective Wuertz''' - Played by [[Ron Dean]], he is a corrupt cop involved in the scarring of Harvey Dent and the death of Rachel Dawes by the Joker.  He was later killed by Dent.
:*'''Detective Stephens''' - Played by [[Keith Szarabajka]], he is an honest police detective, if not aversed to police brutality. He aided Gordon when he faked his own death.
