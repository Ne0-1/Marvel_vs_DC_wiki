'''The Nightmaster''' is a [[DC Comics]] superhero. He first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #82 (May 1969), the first in a series that ran through #84. 

== Character History ==
'''Jim Rook''' was the lead singer of The Electrics, a rock band, who entered a run-down shop named Oblivion Inc. Inside, he was somehow transported to the strange dimension Myrra, where he was the descendant of the mighty Myrra warrior Nacht. He took his ancestor's Sword of Night, a sword with the ability that warns of danger and forces a person to speak the truth (much like [[Wonder Woman]]'s lasso), and became involved in the conflict between Myrra and the evil warlocks. After his adventures in Myrra, he opened a bookstore in the Oblivion Inc. and became active with other superheroes [[Primal Force]] and [[Swamp Thing]].

Starting with ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'', he became active again as the leader of the ''[[Shadowpact]]''.

Recently, it was revealed that the longer he's in possession of the sword, the less he ages.
