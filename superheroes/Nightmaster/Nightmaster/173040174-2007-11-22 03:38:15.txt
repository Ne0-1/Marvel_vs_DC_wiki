'''The Nightmaster''' is a [[DC Comics]] superhero. He first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #82 (May 1969), the first in a series that ran through #84. 

== Character History ==
'''Jim Rook''' is the lead singer of The Electrics, a rock band, who enters a run-down shop named Oblivion Inc. Inside, he is somehow transported to the strange dimension Myrra, where he is the descendant of the mighty Myrra warrior Nacht. He takes his ancestor's Sword of Night, a sword with the ability to warn of danger and force a person to speak the truth (much like [[Wonder Woman]]'s lasso), and becomes involved in the conflict between Myrra and the evil warlocks. After his adventures in Myrra, he opens a bookstore in the Oblivion Inc. and becomes active with other superheroes [[Primal Force]] and [[Swamp Thing]].

Starting with ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'', he becomes active again as the leader of the ''[[Shadowpact]]''.

Before the Riverrock, Wyoming incident, Jim is the propertier of a mystical pub called the 'Oblivion Bar'. It exists inside its own dimension, with its own rules and methods. For example, the bars phone does not work unless the dimension's area code is known. 

When the Shadowpact team enter the mystical shield around Riverrock and defeat the murderous Pentacle, they lose a full year of their lives, though they only perceive about a day passing. Back 'home', Jim discovers his bar had been taken over by a younger man, who possesses powerful telekinetic abillities. Many other people could have easily been tossed out the door but the new 'owner' can squeeze shut a trachea. Jim handles this situation subtly, mainly by ignoring him and failing to convey needed information. Jim becomes swept up in other events; mystical assassins attacking and other needs, mainly organizing his team into a more effective fighting force. 

Recently, it is revealed that the longer he is in possession of the sword, the less he ages.  In ''Shadowpact'' #12, Rook learns that his sword is inhabited by the last wielder, his own father.
