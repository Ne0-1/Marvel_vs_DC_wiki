[[#Alternate versions|Alternate versions]] of Rogers from within the MCU [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] also appear in the animated series ''[[What If...?

These versions include an incarnation of Rogers who instead of receiving the serum, wears a [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)#Non-Iron Man armors|mechanized suit of armor]] and becomes the '''Hydra Stomper'''.

==Concept and creation==
Captain America was first conceived as a comic book character in 1940,<ref name="JoeSimonp50" /> as a direct response to the military actions of [[Nazi Germany]], prior to the United States entering World War II.<ref name="Wright" /> The initial introduction of the character included the concepts of a soldier named Steve Rogers being given a serum bestowing enhanced strength and agility, wearing a patriotic red, white and blue uniform, [[Captain America's shield|carrying a shield]], and having as a sidekick a teenaged [[Bucky Barnes]]. In the 1960s, Marvel decided to test bringing the character back as part of the Avengers, with the premise that the character had been frozen for the two decades since the war, and was "haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society".<ref name="Wright" /> Live-action performances of the character in television and film serials began within a few years after its creation, with a [[Captain America (1990 film)|1990 feature film]] resulting in critical and financial failure.<ref name="EW92" />

In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Captain America. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012" /> In 2005, Marvel received a $525&nbsp;million investment from [[Merrill Lynch]], allowing them to independently produce ten films, including ''Captain America''. [[Paramount Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film.<ref name="Development3" /><ref name="Development5" /><ref name="Development6" />

{{quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote="Casting Captain America was super hard. I started to think, 'Are we not going to be able to find Captain America, and if we can't, what are we going to do with ''Avengers''? Is the whole thing going to fall apart?' And, then, finally opening ourselves up to Chris Evans, who we had initially sort of just looked past because he was [[Human Torch#Film|Johnny Storm]] in a ''[[Fantastic Four (film series)|Fantastic Four]]'' franchise. Then, bringing him in and showing him the artwork, showing him what was happening in this movie, and he took a weekend to decide."|source=—[[Kevin Feige]], President of Production for Marvel Studios, on casting Chris Evans as Captain America.<ref name="FeigeInterviewVanityFair" />}}
Originally, the film would stand alone; Feige said "about half" the movie would be set during World War II before moving into the modern day.<ref name="IGN2007" /> Producer [[Avi Arad]] said, "The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, looking at our world through the eyes of someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and who are we today? Are we better?" He cited the [[Back to the Future (franchise)#Films|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]] as an influence, and claimed he had "someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director".<ref name="Development7" /> In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date.<ref name="Development8" /> In April 2006, [[David Self]] was hired to write the script.<ref name="Self" /> [[Joe Johnston]] met with Marvel to discuss directing the film and signed on in November 2008,<ref name="Johnston" /> hiring [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] to rewrite.<ref name="MarkusMcFreely" />

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported in March 2010 that [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] was cast as Captain America;<ref name="EvansConfirmed" /> [[Ryan Phillippe]] and [[John Krasinski]] were also considered for the role.<ref name="PhillippeKrasinski" /> Evans, who previously worked with Marvel as the [[Human Torch]] in the [[Fantastic Four in film#Tim Story films (2005–2007)|''Fantastic Four'' film series]], initially declined the part three times before signing a six-picture deal with Marvel,<ref name="EW" /> saying, "I think Marvel is doing a lot of good things right now, and it's a fun character.&nbsp;... I think the story of Steve Rogers is great. He's a great guy. Even if it [were] just a script about anybody, I would probably want to do it. So it wasn't necessarily about the comic itself."<ref name="ScreenRant2010" /> In April, it was reported that [[Joss Whedon]] would rewrite the script as part of his negotiation to write and direct ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. Whedon said in August, "I just got to make some character connections. The structure of the thing was really tight and I loved it, but there were a couple of opportunities to find his voice a little bit —and some of the other characters'— and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be. And progressing through the script to flesh it out a little bit".<ref name="PrePro6" />

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Steve Rogers was born on July 4, 1918, in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to Joseph and Sarah Rogers. His father, a member of the [[107th Infantry Regiment (United States)|107th Infantry Regiment]], was killed by [[mustard gas]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. He was raised by his mother, a nurse, who died of [[tuberculosis]], leaving Rogers alone at the age of eighteen.{{efn|name=Civil War|As stated in the letter he wrote to Tony Stark at the end of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.}} At just {{convert|5|ft|4|in|adj=on}} tall and weighing only {{convert|90|lb}}, Rogers was also afflicted with a number of medical issues including [[asthma]], [[scoliosis]], [[heart arrhythmia]], partial [[deafness]], [[stomach ulcers]], and [[pernicious anemia]].{{efn|name=Winter Soldier|As seen in a museum exhibit shown in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''.}}

===Becoming Captain America and battling Hydra===
{{further|Captain America: The First Avenger}}
At the outset of [[World War II]], Rogers attempts to enlist in the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] but is repeatedly rejected due to his numerous health problems. In 1942, while attending the Stark Expo with his best friend, [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James "Bucky" Barnes]], Rogers again attempts to enlist. Dr. [[Abraham Erskine (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Abraham Erskine]] overhears Rogers speaking with Barnes, and approves his enlistment due to his continued efforts to serve his country despite his physical handicaps. He is recruited into the [[Strategic Scientific Reserve]] (SSR) as part of a super-soldier experiment under Erskine, U.S. Army [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chester Phillips (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chester Phillips]], and British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peggy Carter]]. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Nazi officer [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Johann Schmidt]], head of the science division called [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]], underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side-effects. Rogers agrees to the treatment nonetheless and is injected with Erskine's serum and doused with vita-rays. After Rogers emerges significantly taller and more muscular, an undercover assassin kills Erskine and flees. Rogers, using his remarkable speed and strength increase, pursues and captures the assassin, who reveals he is a Hydra agent and commits suicide with a [[cyanide]] capsule. With Erskine dead and the formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt takes advantage of the media hype around Rogers' actions, and has him tour the nation in a colorful costume with the title of Captain America to promote the sale of [[War Bond|war bonds]]. In 1943, Rogers would lose his virginity to a woman during the USO tour[https://amp.toofab.com/2022/08/18/chris-evans-she-hulk-captain-america-virginity/ .] 

While [[Italian campaign (World War II)|on tour in Italy]], Rogers learns that the 107th unit – Barnes' unit – was [[Missing in action|MIA]] in a battle against Schmidt's forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard Stark]] fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the Hydra facility, freeing Barnes and 400 other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who reveals himself to be the "[[Red Skull]]" and escapes. Despite disobeying orders, Rogers is rewarded for his heroics and is formally promoted to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]. He recruits Barnes and several other elite soldiers, who were among the prisoners he rescued, to form a team called the [[Howling Commandos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howling Commandos]] to attack other Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a [[Captain America's shield (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|circular shield]] made of [[Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|vibranium]], a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Over the next two years, Rogers and the Howling Commandos help to turn the tide of the war in favor of [[The Allies (WWII)|the Allies]]. The team eventually captures top Hydra scientist Dr. [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]] on a train, but Barnes falls to his presumed death during the battle. Using information extracted from Zola, Rogers leads an attack on the final Hydra stronghold to stop Schmidt from using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] on America’s cities. Rogers infiltrates the final Hydra base with the help of the SSR, including Carter who reveals her mutual romantic feelings toward Rogers and the two share a kiss before Schmidt escapes in an aircraft carrying the weapons and is pursued by Rogers. During the confrontation, the source of Hydra's advanced weapons, the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]], is physically handled by Schmidt causing him to vanish within a bright light. The Tesseract is lost in the ocean and with no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating the bombs, Rogers reluctantly bids farewell to Carter via the plane's communications system and crashes it and himself in the Arctic.

===Adjusting to the modern era and the Battle of New York===
{{See|The Avengers (2012 film)|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}
In 2011, Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] [[baseball]] radio broadcast that something is wrong, he flees outside and finds himself in present-day [[Times Square]], where [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] informs him that he has been frozen in [[suspended animation]] for nearly 70 years.

Rogers learns that most of his World War II-era comrades are deceased and he struggles to adjust to the modern world. In 2012, He is approached by Fury, who has activated the "[[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Initiative]]", with an assignment to retrieve the stolen Tesseract from [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]. Rogers agrees and is introduced to [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] by Agent [[Phil Coulson]]. In [[Stuttgart]], Rogers and Loki have a brief physical confrontation until [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] arrives, resulting in Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D. on the [[Quinjet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Quinjet]], his brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan. After a confrontation between Thor, Stark, and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helicarrier]].

The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons much like Hydra had in the 1940s. Agents possessed by Loki, including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]], attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers work together to restart. Loki escapes, and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Rogers invites Barton to join the Avengers after he is freed by Romanoff from his mind control. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole in [[New York City]] above [[Stark Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Tower]] to allow the alien species of the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] to invade. However, Rogers successfully leads the Avengers in defending the city and they defeat and capture Loki. Following the battle, Rogers coordinates the search and rescue of injured civilians. Thor returns Loki to [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]] to face justice for his invasion and the Avengers go their separate ways. Rogers, with newfound purpose in the modern world, rides off on his motorcycle.

Sometime afterwards, Rogers in his Captain America uniform records a number of [[public service announcements]] for high school students, encouraging them to do things like maintain healthy lifestyles, obey rules, and practice patience.<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Connell |first1=Sean |title=The Hilarious Story Behind Spider-Man: Homecoming's Captain America PSAs |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1676730/the-hilarious-story-behind-spider-man-homecomings-captain-america-psas |website=cinemablend.com |publisher=[[Cinema Blend]] |access-date=April 29, 2021 |date=July 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Dismantling Hydra and fighting the Winter Soldier===
{{See|Captain America: The Winter Soldier}}
In 2014, Rogers works for S.H.I.E.L.D. in [[Washington, D.C.]] under Fury, while continuing to adjust to contemporary society. Rogers and Romanoff are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team, led by Agent [[Brock Rumlow (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brock Rumlow]], to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite launch vessel, the ''Lemurian Star'', that has been hijacked by a terrorist group led by [[Georges Batroc (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Georges Batroc]]. Rogers and S.T.R.I.K.E successfully rescue the hostages, but Batroc escapes when Rogers discovers Romanoff has her own agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. Rogers returns to the [[Triskelion (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Triskelion]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites designed to preemptively eliminate threats against America. Rogers, citing his moral issues with such a program, expresses concern that the project will likely result in the deaths of innocent people. He visits an elderly Carter who expresses regret that Rogers never got to live the life he deserved.

Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official [[Alexander Pierce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alexander Pierce]] to delay the project. Fury, ambushed by assailants led by the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]], escapes and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, but hands Rogers a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing Romanoff's data. Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion, revealing evidence that Fury hired Batroc to hijack the ship as cover to retrieve the data, but when Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a [[fugitive]]. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers escapes capture and meets with Romanoff. Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker below Camp Leigh, Rogers' old military training base in [[New Jersey]], where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola reveals that after S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded following World War II, Hydra has secretly operated within its ranks and creating world crisis that will eventually cause humanity to sacrifice freedom for security. A S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and the pair realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader.

Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|USAF pararescueman]] [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], whom Rogers befriended earlier, and acquire his powered "Falcon" [[Wingsuit flying|wingpack]]. Deducing that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jasper Sitwell]] is a Hydra [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], they force him to divulge Hydra's plan to use satellite-guided guns to eliminate individuals identified by an algorithm as a threat to Hydra. They are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, whom Rogers recognizes as Bucky Barnes, his friend who he thought had died during World War II. S.H.I.E.L.D. operative [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips. After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers exposes Hydra's plot causing an internal conflict within S.H.I.E.L.D. Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown into the [[Potomac River]].

===Leading the Avengers and combating Ultron===
{{See|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}
In 2015, in the [[Eastern Europe]]an country of [[Sokovia]], Rogers leads the Avengers against a Hydra facility to recover [[Loki's scepter]]. They are attacked by the twins [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro Maximoff]], two superpowered experimental volunteers. The Avengers succeed in obtaining the scepter and Rogers captures Hydra leader [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Baron Strucker]]. Returning to the Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner use the scepter to complete Stark's "[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]" global defense program. Afterwards, the Avengers host a celebratory party and Ultron reveals himself and attacks the team at the Avengers Tower, before escaping. In [[Johannesburg]], the Avengers confront and battle Ultron, Wanda, and Pietro. Rogers is subdued by Wanda after she produces hallucinatory visions to him of World War II and Peggy Carter. After Maximoff also causes the Hulk to ravage the city before being subdued by Stark, Rogers and the other defeated Avengers take refuge at Barton's secret residence so they can recover. While there, they are encouraged by Fury to assemble and stop Ultron.

In [[Seoul]], Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton attempt to stop Ultron from uploading his network into a synthetic vibranium body powered by the [[Mind Stone]]. Rogers fights Ultron in an attempt to keep him from completing the upload. He is assisted by the Maximoff twins who side with the Avengers after learning Ultron plans to exterminate humanity. They retrieve the synthetic body, but Romanoff is captured. At the Avengers Tower, the Avengers have a dispute over the synthetic body which is activated and becomes [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]. Rogers and the Avengers then return to Sokovia, where they engage in a battle against Ultron and are able to defeat him, but at the cost of Pietro's life and the complete destruction of the city. At the new Avengers Compound in [[Upstate New York]], Rogers and Romanoff begin training new team members Wanda, [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], Vision, and Wilson.

===Sokovia Accords===
{{further|Captain America: Civil War}}
In 2016, Rogers, Maximoff, Romanoff, and Wilson stop Rumlow, now working as a mercenary, from stealing a [[biological weapon]] from a lab in [[Lagos]]. Rumlow, who was previously a Hydra agent, attempts to kill Rogers with a [[suicide bomb]], but Maximoff saves him. However, she mistakenly kills several [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]n humanitarian workers in the process. This leads to [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus Ross]] informing the Avengers that the [[United Nations]]  is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish a U.N. panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers is hesitant to give the government that kind of control over the team.

[[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]], seeking to destroy the Avengers as revenge for the death of his family in Sokovia, tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' Winter Soldier brainwashing. Barnes is framed for the [[Vienna]] bombing that kills King [[T'Chaka (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Chaka]] of Wakanda, and T'Chaka's son [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], the [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]], vows vengeance. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to [[Bucharest]] and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but are apprehended. Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo sends Barnes on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and hides him. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the [[Siberia]]n Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in cryogenic stasis.

Rogers and Wilson go rogue; they recruit Barton, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]], and Maximoff to their cause. Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, Rhodes, Vision, T'Challa, and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the rogue Avengers. They fight at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] in Germany, until Romanoff helps Rogers and Barnes escape. Stark strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes after finding out about Zemo, but Zemo reveals footage of an automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 that contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them. After an intense fight, Rogers disables Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Rogers breaks his team out of the [[Raft (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Raft]], and heads to Wakanda with Barnes, where Barnes chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. Wanted by the U.N. for breaking the Sokovia Accords, Rogers, Maximoff, Romanoff, and Wilson go into hiding, while Barton and Lang strike a deal with the government for [[house arrest]] so that they can be with their families.

===Infinity War===
{{See|Avengers: Infinity War}}
In 2018, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson rescue Maximoff and Vision in [[Scotland]] from [[Corvus Glaive (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Corvus Glaive]] and [[Proxima Midnight (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Proxima Midnight]], two of [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]' [[Children of Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|children]]. They return to the Avengers Compound, reuniting with Banner and Rhodes. Rhodes refuses Secretary Ross's order to arrest Rogers, Romanoff, Wilson, and Maximoff; and Rogers informs Ross they intend to defend the Earth against the incoming threat, with or without permission from the Sokovia Accords. The Avengers travel to Wakanda to have the Mind Stone removed from Vision without destroying him in the process. Rogers orders Maximoff to destroy the stone as soon as it is removed from his head. As Thanos' children and the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]] invade, Rogers, Barnes, Romanoff, Wilson, Rhodes, Banner, T'Challa, and the Wakandan armies mount a defense and get support when Thor, [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] arrive. Rogers attempts to rally the Avengers against Thanos who successfully destroys Vision, obtains the Mind Stone, and completes the Infinity Gauntlet. Rogers survives [[the Blip]], but is left defeated.

Returning to the Avengers Compound, Rogers and Romanoff assess the worldwide casualties and discover that Thanos destroyed half of all living things. They are met by [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]], who arrives answering Nick Fury's pager. After Danvers brings Stark and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]] to the Compound, Rogers leads a team consisting of Rocket, Danvers, Thor, Romanoff, Rhodes, Banner, and Nebula into space to hunt Thanos. They confront and subdue Thanos and are horrified to learn that he destroyed the stones to prevent his mission from ever being undone. Rogers watches an enraged Thor decapitate Thanos.

===Avenging the fallen ===
{{See|Avengers: Endgame}}
In 2023, Rogers leads a support group for grieving survivors in New York City. Rogers and Romanoff are shocked when Lang arrives at the Avengers Compound and explains that he has been trapped in the [[Quantum Realm]] for five years and suggests using it as a form of [[time travel]]. Rogers, Romanoff, and Lang visit Stark but he refuses to help. They meet Banner at a diner who agrees, however, their initial attempts at time travel are unsuccessful. Stark returns to the Compound, revealing he has unlocked the key to successful time travel, and he and Rogers conclude their nearly decade-long feud, reestablishing their trust in one another with Stark returning Rogers' shield. After Barton and Thor return to the Compound, the team formulates a plan and Rogers teams up with Stark, Banner, and Lang to travel to 2012 to retrieve the three Stones present in New York City during Loki's invasion.

They succeed in securing the [[Time Stone]] and the Mind Stone, with Rogers having to fight the 2012 version of himself to facilitate this. However, after the [[Space Stone]] plan goes awry, it necessitates a trip to 1970 so that Stark can recover it from [[Camp Lehigh|a S.H.I.E.L.D. base]] in New Jersey, while Rogers finds [[Pym Particles (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pym Particles]] at the same base for their trip back. While in the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Rogers sees the 1970 version of Peggy Carter through a window. The Avengers return, save for Romanoff who sacrificed herself for the mission, and the original Avengers hold a silent mourning for her. After Rocket, Stark, and Banner create a gauntlet, Banner reverses the Blip. However, the 2014 version of Thanos emerges from the quantum realm and attacks the Avengers Compound.

Rogers, Stark and Thor engage Thanos and during the fight, Rogers proves worthy to wield Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]]. Thanos proves too powerful and Rogers, bruised and battered with his shield in tatters, stands up alone to face Thanos and his entire army. However, the restored Avengers, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians]], the Wakandan army, [[Masters of the Mystic Arts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Masters of the Mystic Arts]], [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravagers]], and Asgardians arrive and Rogers rallies them all in a final battle against Thanos. With no other options for victory, Stark steals the Infinity Stones from Thanos and snaps his fingers. Thanos and his army disintegrate, and Stark dies while Rogers looks on in grief.

After attending Stark's funeral, Rogers reunites with Barnes, Wilson and Banner before returning the Infinity Stones and Mjolnir to their appropriate times and places. However, Rogers also decides to return to 1945 to reunite with Carter,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kandell |first1=Zachary |title=Avengers: Endgame Script Reveals What Year Steve Rogers Reunited With Peggy |url=https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-script-year-steve-rogers-peggy-reunite/ |website=cbr.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] |access-date=May 11, 2021 |date=December 9, 2019}}</ref> where he marries and lives a full life with her. Returning to Barnes, Wilson and Banner, he appears as an elderly man finally at peace, and passes his shield and mantle to Wilson.

===Legacy===
{{See|The Falcon and the Winter Soldier|Hawkeye (2021 TV series)|Eternals (film)|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}
Six months following the Blip, Wilson struggles with the idea of taking up Rogers' title as Captain America and instead gives the shield to the U.S. government so it can be displayed in a [[Smithsonian]] museum exhibit dedicated to Rogers. [[Joaquin Torres (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Joaquin Torres]] mentions to Wilson that discussions about Rogers' whereabouts have become an internet [[conspiracy theory]], and a common one is that he is hidden in a secret [[Lunar outpost (NASA)|moonbase]]. The government names [[John Walker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Walker]] as the new Captain America and gives him the shield.

Barnes confronts Wilson, who reveals that he did not feel comfortable being Rogers' successor. Walker indicates his desire to fill Rogers' shoes but comes into conflict with Wilson and Barnes, who refuse to work with him and the [[Global Repatriation Council]] (GRC) in tracking down the [[Flag Smashers]], a group of terrorist super soldiers. Barnes introduces Wilson to [[Isaiah Bradley (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Isaiah Bradley]], an [[African-American]] successor to Rogers that he came into conflict with during the [[Korean War]]. Bradley was kept a secret (even from Rogers), imprisoned for thirty years, and experimented on by the government and Hydra. Wilson and Barnes learn that Bradley's blood was used to create a new variation of the Super Soldier Serum for the [[Sharon Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Broker]] but was stolen and used by the Flag Smashers. [[Helmut Zemo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helmut Zemo]] destroys all but one of the remaining vials of the serum, which is secretly retrieved by Walker, who uses it and gains super soldier abilities. Walker murders a Flag Smasher with the shield while a horrified crowd watches and records him. Wilson and Barnes forcibly take the shield from Walker, who has the Captain America title stripped from him by the government. Wilson eventually takes up the mantle as Rogers intended. Wilson, with assistance from Barnes, Walker, and Sharon Carter, defeats the Flag Smashers, and Wilson convinces the GRC to end its forced [[Population transfer|resettlement]] practices. Wilson later has a memorial dedicated to Isaiah Bradley added to the Captain America museum exhibit. 

When the [[Eternals (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eternals]] reconvene, they ponder who will lead the Avengers now that Rogers and Tony Stark are both gone. [[Ikaris (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ikaris]] verbalizes a belief that he could lead the team, but [[Gilgamesh (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gilgamesh]] rebuffs the idea.  

In 2024, the [[Statue of Liberty]] is modified and undergoes construction to replace the torch with Captain America's shield in honor of Rogers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bradley |first1=Bill |title=Marvel Is Replacing The Statue of Liberty With Captain America In Phase 4 |url=https://screenrant.com/spiderman-no-way-home-captain-america-statue-liberty-replacement/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |access-date=22 November 2021 |date=18 November 2021}}</ref> However, this addition is damaged by [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Norman Osborn]] during a battle involving [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] and two versions of him from alternate realities, (dubbed "[[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter-Two]]" and "[[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter-Three]]"). Additionally, a [[Broadway theatre]] production entitled ''[[Rogers: The Musical]]'' is created as an homage to Rogers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Darwish |first1=Meaghan |title='Rogers: The Musical' Seen in 'Hawkeye' Trailer Features Real Broadway Stars |url=https://www.tvinsider.com/1013647/hawkeye-disney-plus-marvel-rogers-the-musical/ |website=tvinsider.com |publisher=[[TV Insider]] |access-date=22 November 2021 |date=14 September 2021}}</ref> While Clint Barton is in New York City, he attends the musical with his family and is displeased with the musical's upbeat depiction of the Battle of New York. He later visits a memorial plaque commemorating the first assembling of the Avengers, and as the leader, Rogers' name is on the top of the memorial.

Rogers joins Carter's Howling Commandos on a mission to assassinate the Red Skull. Rogers is caught off-guard on a train loaded with explosives. They detonate, causing an [[avalanche]] after which Rogers is presumed dead. In a final mission to stop Hydra at their research facility, the Commandos find a captured Rogers and the Hydra Stomper suit. The Commandos use a generator to repower the suit, and Rogers rejoins the fight.

==Characterization==
===Outward appearance and equipment===
Costume designer [[Anna B. Sheppard]] stated that Captain America's uniform in ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' (2011) was partly based on that of [[paratroopers]] of the era, explaining, "I think that the challenge of this costume was that it had to look 40s, that's why certain elements like using leather for the straps and belt, metal buckles and not having too tight a fit were important. Forget spandex!"<ref name="SheppardTFA" /> Visual Development Supervisor Ryan Meinerding elaborated, "The straps that come off his chest are very similar to the [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment|ALICE]] webbing that was used in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Using the straps as the stripes across his torso then seemed like an elegant design solution. In the end, the main design aspects of this suit are meant to be about making it appear soldier-like, functional and tough."<ref name="MeinerdingTFA" /> In ''The Avengers'' (2012), his suit was made to look "a bit more 'superhero'" in comparison to ''The First Avenger'', at [[Joss Whedon]]'s request. Costume designer [[Alexandra Byrne]] stated the difference between both suits were "the fabrics that are available. Today we have a lot of stretch fabrics and there weren't any 'technofabrics' then", and called his design "the most technically difficult" of the Avengers' costumes.<ref name="ByrneTFA" />

For ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' (2014), Evans trained in [[parkour]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[karate]], [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]], and [[gymnastics]], as the [[Russo brothers]] believed that bringing Rogers into the modern day also meant that he had studied and mastered modern fighting styles and techniques. The filmmakers also looked to make the character's shield, which has traditionally been used for defense, a more offensive weapon.<ref name="StitchKingdom" /> For ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015), Evans said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''The Winter Soldier'' by working out up to an hour a day.<ref name="EvansInquirer" /> Evans didn't want to take a step back from the skills shown in ''The Winter Soldier'', and made sure Rogers' fighting style advanced, showing "a consistent display of strength" and having Rogers utilizing his environment.<ref name="FandangoAoU" /> Evans' training regimen to get in shape for the role included weight lifting, which consisted of "the classic bodyweight and bodybuilding stuff", gymnastics and [[plyometrics]], while staying away from cardio-based exercises, along with a high-protein diet.<ref name="EvansBodyBuilding" /> For ''Civil War'', his costume in the film received "subtle changes to all the details and cut" as well as its color, becoming a combination of the stealth suit from ''Winter Soldier'' and the ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015) suit.<ref name="StitchKingdom2" /> In ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018), Rogers receives new vibranium gauntlets from [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]] to replace his traditional shield.<ref name="EWIW" />

In his civilian attire throughout the series, it has been noted that Rogers "tends to go for a very low key look ... based around very simple pieces that work together".<ref name="TechnoB" /> In his earliest appearance, designed by Sheppard, "post-serum Steve was All-American in a devastatingly tight white tee and khaki pants",<ref name="SyfyFashion" /> while in ''The Avengers'' Byrne made him "sophisticated enough to beautifully blend plaids and stripes."<ref name="SyfyFashion" /> Costume designer [[Judianna Makovsky]] described his fashion evolution between ''Winter Soldier'' and ''Captain America: Civil War'' (2016) as becoming increasingly comfortable in his clothes.<ref name="MakovskyCW" /> A ''New York'' magazine article, however, criticized his clothing across the series as being "bereft of patterns, graphics, imagery or anything you couldn't color in with one singular crayon".<ref name="DworkenVulture" />

===Personality===
In ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' (2011), Steve Rogers begins as a frail, sickly young man who is enhanced to the peak of human ability by an experimental serum in order to aid the United States in World War II.<ref name="EvansConfirmed" /> Regarding the extent of the character's abilities Evans remarked, "He would crush the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. Any Olympic sport he's gonna dominate. He can jump higher, run faster, lift stronger weight, but he can be injured. He could roll an ankle and be out for the season. He's not perfect, he's not untouchable. So a lot of the effects, if I'm going to punch someone they're not going to put them on a cable and fly them back 50&nbsp;feet, but he's going to go down, probably not getting back up, which I think humanizes it. It makes it something that, again, I think everyone can relate to a little bit more, which I really like."<ref name="SuperheroHypeTFA" />

Evans said that Rogers is much darker in ''The Avengers'' (2012): "It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about ... He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world."<ref name="EWAvengers" /> Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, "I think there's certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun."<ref name="MTVAvengers" /> A key moment in ''The Avengers'' occurs when Stark, who had been dismissive of Rogers at earlier points in the film, defers to Rogers as leader of the newly formed team to defend New York against a large-scale attack.<ref name="AVClubAvengers" /> Describing his character's continuing adjustment to the modern world in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' (2014), Evans said, "It's not so much about his shock with [technology]... It's more about the societal differences. He's gone from the '40s to today; he comes from a world where people were a little more trusting, the threats not as deep. Now, it's harder to tell who's right and wrong. Actions you take to protect people from threats could compromise liberties and privacy. That's tough for Steve to swallow."<ref name="/FilmTWS" />

In his next appearance, in ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015), Rogers is the leader of the Avengers.<ref name="MTVAoU" /><ref name="DigitalSpyAoU" /> Evans stated that since the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers has been left to depend on his Avenger teammates without the structure of military life and is now "looking to understand where he belongs, not just as a soldier, as Captain America, but as Steve Rogers, as a person."<ref name="BuzzFeedAoU" /> In ''Captain America: Civil War'' (2016), Rogers becomes the leader of a faction of the Avengers against regulation.<ref name="VarietyCW" /><ref name="FandangoCW" />  Director Anthony Russo described Captain America's character arc in the film as taking him "from the most ra-ra company man" and "a somewhat willing propagandist" to "an insurgent" at the end of the film.<ref name="RussosEmpire" /> Unlike the comics' Civil War, the film was never going to kill Rogers, as the directors thought that was "an easy ending ... The more difficult and more interesting place to leave a family fight is: can these important relationships ever be repaired? Is this family broken permanently?"<ref name="Empire12Secrets" />

Director Joe Russo said that after the events of ''Civil War'', Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others.<ref name="RussosHuffPost" /> In ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018), the character embodies the "spirit" of his comic alternate identity [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] in the film.<ref name="NotNomad" /> An early draft of the film experimented with Rogers first appearing in the film saving Vision from Corvus Glaive during the third act. Markus and McFeely said they were called "insane" for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was "not [a] satisfying" approach.<ref name="RogersLateEntry" />

In ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019), Christopher Markus described Rogers as someone who is "moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest." Both he and McFeely knew he was going to get "the dance" he promised Peggy Carter in ''The First Avenger'', with McFeely saying, "He's postponed a life in order to fulfill his duty. That's why I didn't think we were ever going to kill him. Because that's not the arc. The arc is, I finally get to put my shield down because I've earned that."<ref name="NYTimesEndgame" />

==Differences from the comic books==
The origin story of Captain America follows that of the comic books, particularly [[Ultimate Marvel]] for certain elements like growing up in Brooklyn and Bucky being a childhood best friend rather than being met later, but diverges from there. Rogers is also a founding Avenger, unlike in the comics where he is a later addition to the roster and the formed Avengers are the ones who thaw him out of the ice.<ref name="ComicsSR" /> In the comic books, Steve Rogers is murdered at the event of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, leading to Bucky Barnes becoming the next Captain America. In the MCU, Rogers survives ''Civil War'',<ref name="ComicsCB" /> eventually passing the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name="EndgameEnding" /> In the comics, Wilson became Captain America in 2014 after Rogers' aging accelerated to be the real age of 90.<ref name="CapVol7" />

==Reception==
{{see also|Stucky (fandom)}}
Evans' portrayal of the character has been positively received by fans and critics. Roger Moore of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' positively reviewed Evans' performance as Steve Rogers, writing that Evans "brings a proper earnestness to the character".<ref name="OrlandoSentinel" /> [[Roger Ebert]] described the character as "a hero we care about and who has some dimension".<ref name="Ebert" /> Likewise, in his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' lauded both actor and character, calling "Chris Evans's effortlessly likable Steve Rogers/Captain America, the team's natural leader."<ref name="MorgensternWSJ" />

Peter DeBruge, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', had a more critical take, finding that "as Marvel heroes go, Captain America must be the most vanilla of the lot", and that because of his quick healing and fighting abilities, "there's never the slightest concern that the Nazis might get the better of him".<ref name="DeBrugeVariety" /> In 2015, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named Captain America the 46th greatest film character of all time.<ref name="EmpireGreatest" /> In a December 2017 interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige called Evans "a great actor" and "a reluctant star". He compared his portrayal of Captain America with [[Christopher Reeve]]'s [[Superman (Salkind films)|Superman]] for the strong association between the actors and their respective characters.<ref name="FeigeInterviewVanityFair" />

Rogers' elderly appearance at the end of ''Avengers: Endgame'' has been noted to resemble [[U.S. President]] [[Joe Biden]], which Evans acknowledged.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leishman |first=Rachel |date=November 11, 2020 |title=Confirmed: Chris Evans Joked to Me About Old Man Steve Rogers Looking Like Joe Biden |url=https://www.themarysue.com/chris-evans-knows-he-looks-like-joe-biden/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112013621/https://www.themarysue.com/chris-evans-knows-he-looks-like-joe-biden/ |archive-date=November 12, 2020 |access-date=May 24, 2022 |website=[[The Mary Sue]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cavalluzzi |first=Andrew |date=November 18, 2020 |title=Avengers: Endgame Deepfake Casts Joe Biden as Old Captain America |url=https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-deepfake-joe-biden-captain-america/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119051133/https://www.cbr.com/avengers-endgame-deepfake-joe-biden-captain-america/ |archive-date=November 19, 2020 |access-date=May 24, 2022 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> His quote "No, I don't think I will" has also become the subject of several [[Internet memes]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Armitage |first=Helen |date=December 5, 2019 |title=What Captain America's "No, I Don't Think I Will" Line Means |url=https://screenrant.com/captain-america-dont-think-will-meme-explained/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227173113/https://screenrant.com/captain-america-dont-think-will-meme-explained/ |archive-date=December 27, 2019 |access-date=July 21, 2021 |website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref>
