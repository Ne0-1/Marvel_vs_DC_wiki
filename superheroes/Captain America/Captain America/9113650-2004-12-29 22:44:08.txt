'''Captain America''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character, whose true identity is Steve Rogers, first appeared in ''Captain America #1'' ([[1941]]).

Captain America was the most prominent of a wave of patriotically-themed superheroes that American [[comic book]] companies introduced during [[World War II]]. With his sidekick [[Bucky (comics)|Bucky]], Captain America faced [[Nazis]] and [[Japan|Japanese]] troops during his [[1940s]] heyday. But the hero faded into obscurity after the war.

In [[1964]], Marvel revived Captain America with the explanation that he his plane had been shot down over the [[Arctic Ocean]] and he had spent the past decade frozen in suspended animation. The hero then became leader of the all-star group [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] and was once again featured in a solo series.

Since then, Captain America has been a much more serious and less jingoistic hero. Writers have portrayed him at odds with the U.S. government and he considers himself more dedicated to defending Americaâ€™s ideals rather than its government or elites.  It's a personal conviction summed up when he confronted a corrupt [[US Army]] general and said "I am loyal to nothing, except the [[American Dream|Dream]]."

==Golden age heyday==
This character was one of the most popular characters that Marvel Comics (then known as [[Timely Comics|Timely]]) had during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].  With [[World War II]] over and his main reason for existence (as a fictional war hero) receding into the past, the character's popularity faded.  He was briefly revived in the mid-[[1950s]] as a blatantly anti-[[Communist]] superhero, but sales were poor.  In the [[1970s]], that version would later be explained away via [[retcon]] as a reactionary imposter who soon lost his sanity due to a flawed replica of the Super Soldier Serum and had to be placed in [[suspended animation]] along with his equally ill sidekick.

==Origin story==
{{spoiler}}
In the current Marvel Universe history, Steve Rogers was a sickly [[United States|American]] [[fine arts]] student specializing in illustration in the early [[1940s]] before America's entry into [[World War II]].  He was disturbed by the rise of the [[Third Reich]] enough to attempt to enlist only to be rejected due to his poor constitution.  By chance, an [[United States Army|Army]] officer looking for test subjects for a top secret defense research project offered Rogers an alternate way to serve his country.  The officer was looking for suitable test subjects for a top secret defense research project, Operation: Rebirth.  This project consisted of developing a means to create physically superior soldiers and Rogers was deemed ideal.  Rogers agreed to volunteer for the research and after a rigorous physical and combat training and selection process, was chosen as the first human test subject. He received injections and oral ingestions of a chemical formula that was termed the Super Soldier Serum, which had been developed by the scientist Dr Emil Erskine (who was code-named Dr Reinstein). Rogers was then exposed to a controlled burst of "Vita-Rays" that activated the chemicals in his system. Although the process was arduous physically, it successfully altered his physiognomy from his relative frail form to the maximum of human efficiency, including greatly enhanced musculature and reflexes.

Unfortunately at this moment of triumph, a [[Nazi]] [[secret agent|spy]] revealed himself and shot Erskine. Because the scientist had committed the crucial portions of the Super Solder formula to memory, it could not be duplicated. Rogers killed the spy in retaliation and vowed to oppose the enemies of America. Meanwhile, the US government decided to make the most of their one super soldier and eventually made him a superhero who served both as a [[counter-intelligence]] agent and a [[propaganda]] symbol to counter Nazi Germany's head of terrorist operations, the [[Red Skull]]. To that end, Rogers was given a costume modelled after the American Flag, a bulletproof steel shield, a personal [[sidearm]] and the name of Captain America.  He was also given a cover identity as a clumsy [[infantry]] private at Fort Lehigh where he made friends with a teenage [[mascot]], [[Bucky (comics)|James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes]].  Soon, Barnes learned Roger's [[secret identity|dual identity]] and offered to keep the secret if he could become his [[sidekick]]. Cap agreed, and trained Barnes appropriately.  Rogers also received a new shield made from a chance mixture of [[iron]], [[vibranium]] and an unknown catalyst which formed an indestructible metal light enough to use as a [[discus]]-like weapon that could be angled to return to him.  It proved so effective that the sidearm was dropped. Throughout World War II, the duo fought the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team called the Invaders.

==1960s Revival==
In ''[[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] #4'' ([[1964]]), the Avengers discovered Captain America's body in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]]. Rogers had been preserved in [[suspended animation]] in a block of ice since [[1945]], which melted when the block was thrown into the ocean by the [[Sub-Mariner]]. When Rogers revived, he related his last, failed mission in the closing days of World War II, when an sabotaged robot plane exploded, killing Bucky and hurling Rogers into the freezing waters. Rogers accepted membership in the Avengers, and although he soon adjusted to modern times well enough to eventually assume leadership of the team, he was plagued by guilt for not being able to prevent Bucky's death.

The character was given his own series, which has now lasted decades longer than his original run. The book has enjoyed the refined artwork of Jack Kirby, as well a notable short run by [[Jim Steranko]].  However, the most notable stories often had a political tone to them, most notably under the authorship of [[Steve Englehart]].  Under his run, Cap encountered his 1950s imposter and dealt with the Marvel Universe's version of the [[Watergate scandal]]. This so severely disillusioned Rogers that he abandoned his Cap identity in favour of [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] only to resume it to face the menace of the Red Skull as a symbol of America's ideals rather than its government.

In the [[1980s]], a similar story was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] when Rogers chose to resign his identity rather than resubmit to the United States government and became The Captain instead.  This extended story arc was intended to illustrate the difference of Captain America's beliefs from his replacement who was intended to illustrate the jingoistic attitude that the popular movie character [[Rambo]] embodied.

Shortly after returning to the position of Captain America, Rogers narrowly avoided the explosion of a [[methamphetamine]] lab, and a chemical reaction between the drug and the Super Soldier Serum present in his system ensued. As a result, the Serum was removed from his system, and now Rogers had to train constantly to maintain his physical condition. This storyline was partly prompted by reader concerns that Captain America was effectively the beneficiary of [[steroid]] treatments.

However, this did not stop his system from deteriorating, and eventually Rogers's body began to break down. For a time, he had to wear an [[exoskeleton]] to keep moving and eventually had to be placed again in suspended animation. During this time, he was given a transfusion of blood from the Red Skull (who now inhabited a body [[Cloning|cloned]] from Rogers's cells), which both cured his condition and restored the Super Soldier formula to his system. Captain America returned both to crimefighting and the Avengers.

Recently, Rogers has gone public with his identity, and has set up his residence in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]].

==Adaptations in other media==
A [[1944]] movie [[serial]] called ''Captain America'' portrayed the hero as a district attorney named Grant Gardner and arbitrarily removed many other important elements of the character, such as his shield and his sidekick, Bucky. A [[1966]] television [[animated series]] called ''Captain America'' appeared; the quality of the animation was is largely judged as poor. There were two [[1979]] poorly-received made-for-TV movies, ''Captain America'' and ''Captain America II: Death Too Soon''. Another feature film in 1991, ''Captain America'', met equally negative reviews. It depicted the hero's battle against his arch-nemesis, the Red Skull, who in the film was an [[Italy|Italian]] rather than a Nazi.

Captain America has also appeared in a 1998 prose novel titled ''Captain America: Liberty's Torch'' by [[Tony Isabella]] and [[Bob Ingersoll]] in which the hero is put on trial for the imagined crimes of America by a hostile militia group.

Captain America has appeared in several [[video game]]s. He was one of four [[playable character]]s in ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]'' ([[1991]]). He later appeared in [[Capcom]]'s [[Marvel Super-Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super-Heroes]] and the subsequent [[Marvel vs. Capcom series]].

----

The [[1978]] [[Kinks]] [[song]] ''Catch Me Now, I'm Falling'', about the ailing U.S. economy in the late [[1970s]], refers to "Captain America calling".

The film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' also makes repeated ironic reference to Captain America.
