'''Captain America''', the alter ego of '''Steve Rogers''' (in some accounts Steven Grant Rogers), is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in [[Timely Comics]]' ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941).

==Publication history==
Captain America was not the [[The Shield (Archie)|first]], but certainly the most prominent and enduring of a wave of patriotically themed superheroes that American [[comic book]] companies introduced just prior to and during [[World War II]]. With his sidekick [[Bucky]], Captain America faced [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[Japan|Japanese]] troops during his 1940s heyday, but the hero faded into obscurity after the war.

In 1964, by which point Timely had evolved into [[Marvel Comics]], Captain America was revived with the explanation that he had fallen from an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] in the final days of the war and spent the past decades frozen in a state of [[suspended animation]]. (Retellings sometimes place the event over the [[English Channel]].) The hero found a new generation of readers as the leader of the all-star group the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and in a new solo series.

Since then, Captain America has been a much more serious and less jingoistic hero. Writers have used the character to reflect the conflict between politics and ideology by placing him at odds with the United States government and angry and troubled about the state of the country. He considers himself dedicated to defending Americaâ€™s ideals rather than its political leadership, a conviction summed up when Captain America confronted an [[United States Army|army]] general who tried to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty. Rogers responded, "I'm loyal to nothing, General.. except the [[American Dream|Dream]]." (''[[Daredevil]]'' #233, August 1986)

Captain America was one of the most popular characters that Marvel Comics (then known as [[Timely Comics|Timely]]) had during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].  With [[World War II]] over and his main reason for existence (as a fictional war hero) receding into the past, the character's popularity faded.  He was briefly revived, along with the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]] by Marvel's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], in ''Young Men'' #24-28 (June 1953-May 1954)) as an anti-[[Communist]] superhero,  but sales were poor.  In the 1970s, that version would be [[retcon]]ned into a separate character - not Steve Rogers -  who briefly took up the mantle.  Marvel has repeatedly revised the Captain America continuity; the character's unbreakable ties to a specific time period make it particularly difficult for the series to avoid conspicuous anomalies and inconsistencies.

==Character biography==
====1940s - Operation: Rebirth====
[[Image:Captainamerica1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941), art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
In current [[Marvel Universe]] history, Steven Rogers was a scrawny [[United States|American]] [[fine arts]] student specializing in illustration in the early 1940s before America's entry into [[World War II]].  He was disturbed by the rise of the [[Third Reich]] enough to attempt to enlist only to be rejected due to his poor constitution.  By chance, an [[United States Army|Army]] officer looking for test subjects for a top secret defense research project offered Rogers an alternate way to serve his country.  This project, Operation: Rebirth, consisted of developing a means to create physically superior soldiers and Rogers was deemed ideal.

Rogers agreed to volunteer for the research and after a rigorous physical and combat training and selection process, was chosen as the first human test subject.  He received injections and oral ingestions of a chemical formula that was termed the Super-Soldier Serum, which had been developed by the scientist Dr. Emil Erskine (who was code-named "Dr. Reinstein").  Rogers was then exposed to a controlled burst of "Vita-Rays" that activated and stabilized the chemicals in his system.  Although the process was arduous physically, it successfully altered his physiology from its relatively frail form to the maximum of human efficiency, including greatly enhanced musculature and reflexes.

[[Image:Captainamerica5.jpg|thumb|200px|''Captain America'' Vol. 5, #5, together with fellow [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] [[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Namor]] and the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]]. Art by [[Steve Epting]].]]
At this moment, a Nazi [[secret agent|spy]] revealed himself and shot Erskine.  Because the scientist had committed the crucial portions of the Super-Soldier formula to memory, it could not be duplicated.  Rogers killed the spy in retaliation (retconned in the 1960s so that the spy accidentally killed himself by fleeing headlong into an "electrical omniverter") and vowed to oppose the enemies of America.  The [[United States]] government, making the most of its one super-soldier, reimagined him as a superhero who served both as a [[counter-intelligence]] agent and a [[propaganda]] symbol to counter Nazi [[Germany]]'s head of terrorist operations, the [[Red Skull]].  To that end, Rogers was given a costume modeled after the [[American flag]], a bulletproof shield, a personal [[sidearm]] and the codename Captain America. He was also given a cover identity as a clumsy [[infantry]] private at Camp LeHigh in Virginia. Barely out of his teens himself, Rogers he made friends with the teenage camp [[mascot]], [[Bucky|James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes]].

Barnes accidentally learned of Roger's [[secret identity|dual identity]] and offered to keep the secret if he could become Captain America's [[sidekick]].  Rogers agreed, and trained Barnes appropriately.  By this time Rogers had met President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who presented him with a new shield made from a chance mixture of [[iron]], [[vibranium]] and an unknown catalyst.  The alloy was indestructible, yet the shield was light enough to use as a [[discus]]-like weapon that could be angled to return to him. (In several stories, due to writer error, the shield was described as an [[adamantium]]-vibranium alloy.) It proved so effective that the sidearm was dropped.  Throughout World War II, Captain America and Bucky fought the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team [[Invaders (comics)|the Invaders]] (beginning with 1970s comics), which after the war evolved into the [[All-Winners Squad]] (in 1940s comics).

Rogers was not the first to be given the Super Soldier formula.  It was revealed years later that while Rogers was still being assessed, some military members of the project felt that a non-soldier was not the right candidate and secretly gave Erskine's incomplete formula to Clinton McIntyre.  However, this made McIntyre violently insane, and he had to be subdued and placed in cold storage.  The criminal organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] would later revive McIntyre as the homicidal Protocide. (''Captain America Annual'', 2000). 

A beta version of the formula was given to [[Isaiah Bradley]], who became the only survivor of a group of [[African-American]] soldiers that "Reinstein" and the military experimented on in 1942.  After the last two members of his group were killed, Bradley stole the costume meant for Rogers and wore it on a suicide mission to destroy the Nazi super-soldier effort at a German concentration camp.  Bradley was captured, but eventually rescued and [[court martial|court martialed]].  He was imprisoned for 17 years in [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Leavenworth]] until he was pardoned by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].  By the time of his release, the long-term effects of the formula turned Bradley into a hulking, sterile giant with the mentality of a 7-year-old.  Rogers would not find out about Bradley until decades later (''Truth: Red, White and Black'', 2003).  The [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]], a member of the [[Young Avengers]], has been revealed to be the grandson of Isaiah Bradley.

According to files in the Weapons Plus Program, a clandestine government organization devoted to the creation of superhumans to combat and eventually exterminate mutants, Rogers was "Weapon I", the first generation living weapon.  Following his disappearance, the following installments of the Weapon Plus Program moved on to new attempts to create the ultimate weapon, experimenting on animals, racial minorities, criminals and eventually mutants, with results such as [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Deadpool]] and [[Fantomex]] (''New X-Men'' #145, October 2003).

In the closing days of World War II in 1945, Captain America and Bucky tried to stop the villainous [[Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental drone plane.  Zemo launched the plane with an armed explosive device on it, with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit.  They reached the plane just before it took off, but when Bucky tried to defuse the bomb, it exploded in mid-air.  The young man was killed instantly, and Rogers was hurled into the freezing waters of either the North Atlantic or the English Channel (accounts differ).  His body was not found, and he was presumed dead.

====Late 1940sâ€“1950s - After Steve Rogers====
Fearing a blow to morale if the news of Captain America's demise was revealed, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] asked William Naslund, the Golden Age patriotic costumed hero known as the Spirit of '76, to assume the role, with a young man named Fred Davis as Bucky.  They continued to serve in the same roles after the war with the [[All-Winners Squad]], until Naslund was fatally injured in a battle with the [[android]] Adam II in 1946 (''What If?'' #4, August 1977). With Naslund's death, Jeff Mace, also known as the Golden Age [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], took over as Captain America, with Davis continuing to act as Bucky.  However, Davis was shot and injured in 1948 and forced to retire.  Mace then teamed up with Betsy "Golden Girl" Ross, and sometime before 1953 gave up his Captain America identity to marry her. Mace contracted [[cancer]] and died some decades later (''Captain America'' #285, September 1983).

In 1953, an unnamed man who idolized Captain America and had done his American History Ph.D. thesis on Rogers discovered some Nazi files in a warehouse in Germany, one of which apparently contained the lost formula for the Super Soldier serum.  He took it to the United States government on the condition that they use it to make him the fourth Captain America.  Needing a symbol for the [[Korean War]], they agreed, and the man underwent plastic surgery to look like Steve Rogers, even assuming that name.  However, the war ended and the project never went forward.  "Rogers" found a teaching job at the Lee School, where he met Jack Monroe, a young orphan who also idolized Captain America.  They decided to use the formula on themselves and became the new Captain America and Bucky, this time fighting the so-called [[Communism|Communist]] scourge (''Young Men'' #24-28, Dec. 1953-May 1954). These stories were written by [[Stan Lee]] with art by a young [[John Romita Sr.]]

"Rogers" and Monroe did not know of and therefore did not undergo the "Vita-Ray" process, however.  The imperfect implementation of the formula in their systems made them [[paranoia|paranoid]], and by the middle of 1954 they were irrationally attacking anyone they perceived to be a Communist.  In 1955 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] placed them in suspended animation.  The 1950s Captain America and Bucky would be revived years later after the return of Steve Rogers, go on another rampage, and be defeated by the man they had modeled themselves after (''Captain America'' #153, Sept. 1972).

====1960s-1970s - The return of Steve Rogers====
[[Image:Avengers4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #4 (March 1964), art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
In ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964), the Avengers discovered Steve Rogers's body in the North Atlantic, his costume under his soldier's uniform and still carrying his shield.  Rogers had been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, which melted after the block was thrown back into the ocean by the [[Sub-Mariner]], enraged that an Arctic tribe was worshipping the frozen figure.  When Rogers revived, he related his last, failed mission in the closing days of the war.  Rogers accepted membership in the Avengers, and although he soon adjusted to modern times well enough to eventually assume leadership of the team, he was plagued by guilt for not being able to prevent Bucky's death.  He also undertook missions for the national security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which was commanded by his old war comrade [[Nick Fury]].

Captain America was once again given his own series (now in its fifth incarnation), which has lasted decades longer than its original run.  The book initially enjoyed the artwork of Jack Kirby as well as a short run by [[Jim Steranko]], and many of the industry's top artists and writers have worked on the book. It was in a storyline during the book's initial series that Rogers met and trained an [[African American]], Sam Wilson, who became the superhero known as the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. The Falcon was one of the few black superheroes in comic books at that time, and it began a long association between the two characters that has continued to the present day.

[[Image:CaptainAmericaV1-180.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover to ''Captain America'' #180 (Dec. 1974). Captain America assumes the "Nomad" identity. Art by [[Gil Kane]].]]
The most notable stories often had a political tone to them. For example, during [[Steve Englehart]]'s stint as writer, Rogers encountered his revived 1950s counterpart and dealt with the Marvel Universe's version of the [[Watergate scandal]].  This last story so severely disillusioned Rogers that he abandoned his Captain America identity in favour of one called [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] only to reassume it to face the menace of the [[Red Skull]], this time as a symbol of America's ideals rather than its government.
During this time, several men tried to assume the Captain America identity, all without success.  Jack Monroe, cured of his mental instability, would, years later, take up the Nomad alias. (''Captain America'' #176-#183, 1974-1975).

====1980s====
In the 1980s, a similar story was written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] when Rogers chose to resign his identity rather than submit to the orders of the United States government and took the alias of "The Captain" instead.  This extended story arc was intended to illustrate the difference of Captain America's beliefs from his replacement who was intended to illustrate the jingoistic attitude that the popular movie character [[Rambo]] embodied and which Rogers did not share.  During this period, the role of Captain America was assumed by John Walker, the former Super-Patriot.  When Rogers returned to his Captain America identity, Walker became the [[John Walker (comics)|USAgent]] (''Captain America'' #332-#351, 1987-1989).

====1990s====
Some time after returning to the position of Captain America, Rogers narrowly avoided the explosion of a [[methamphetamine]] lab, but it triggered a chemical reaction between the drug and the Super-Soldier serum in his system. To combat this reaction, the serum was removed from his system, and now Rogers had to train constantly to maintain his physical condition. The storyline was partly prompted by reader concerns that Captain America was effectively the beneficiary of [[steroid]] treatments. A [[retcon]] was then introduced to establish that the serum was not a drug, because if it were, Rogers' body would have metabolized it out of his system some time ago. It was revealed that the "serum" was in fact a virus that had affected a biochemical and genetic change, explaining how the Red Skull (who now inhabited a body [[cloning|cloned]] from Rogers' cells) also had the formula in his body.

However, because of his altered biochemistry which took the form of the "serum" in his blood work, Rogers's body began to deteriorate due to overuse of the "serum". For a time, he had to wear a powered [[exoskeleton]] to keep moving and eventually had to be placed again in suspended animation.  During this time, he was given a transfusion of blood from the Red Skull, which cured his condition and stablized the Super-Soldier serum/virus in his system.  Captain America returned both to crime fighting and the Avengers (''Captain America'' #425-#454, 1994-1996).

====2000s====
Eventually, Rogers went public with his identity again, and established a residence in the [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Most recently, he has discovered evidence that Bucky may have survived, and may be the mysterious [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]].

==Powers and abilities==
Rogers in the regular Marvel Universe has no superhuman powers. However, as a result of the Super-Soldier serum, he was transformed from a frail young man into a "nearly perfect" specimen of human development and conditioning, making him able to lift (press) 800 lbs over his head with extreme effort. He has also been depicted curling 500 lbs. numerous times in a workout routine. Captain America is as strong, fast, agile, and durable as it is possible for a human being to be without being considered superhuman. The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and also prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being.

Mentally, his battle experience and training has also made him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle.  Rogers's reflexes and senses are also extraordinarily keen.  He has mastered boxing, jiu-jitsu and judo, combined with his virtually superhuman gymnastic ability into his own unique fighting style. Years of practice with using his indestructible shield has made it practically an extension of his own body, and he is able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy and [[ricochet]] the shield to hit multiple targets. He is also one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel Universe.

==Weapons and Equipment==
Rogers has used several shields over the years.  His first shield was badge-shaped and made of a bulletproof alloy. After complaints by a rival comics company that it too closely resembled the symbol of its superhero The Shield, Captain America's shield was replaced in ''Captain America Comics'' #2 with the disc-shaped indestructible one. 
When he returned from suspended animation, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] "improved" the shield by incorporating electronic and magnetic components in it so that Rogers could even control it in flight.  However, Rogers soon discarded the additional components because he found that it upset the balance of the shield.

The shield is composed of an alloy of iron and vibranium along with a third, unknown element that acted as a catalyst. The vibranium in the shield is what absorbs much of the kinetic impact from any blows that the shield receives, allowing it to withstand incredible amounts of damage without injuring Rogers in the process.

Rogers' indestructible shield has often been referred to as being an adamantium-vibranium alloy. This is not the case: adamantium was only developed after Rogers was revived from suspended animation, during experiments to try and duplicate the material of the shield (''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #66, July 1969). This error first arose in the Captain America entry in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' (the composition of the shield was accurately described in the Adamantium entry) and was propagated in several subsequent stories. Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] finally set the record straight in ''Avengers Annual'' 2001.

When Rogers gave up the costume and shield to John Walker and became the Captain, he used a pure adamantium shield provided, once again, by Stark.  Rogers returned this shield to Stark, however, when he learned that Stark wanted Rogers not to interfere with Stark's efforts to retrieve his [[Iron Man]] technology from others by force.  Rogers then turned to the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], who provided him with a vibranium shield.  When Rogers reassumed the Captain America identity, he regained his indestructible shield along with his costume.

Rogers has also used two energy shields, during periods when the indestructible shield was unavailable â€” a cool-temperature plasma shield that was later reconfigured as a photon shield, both provided by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] technicians.  The photon shield worked by creating a force field whose frequency mimicked a vibranium matrix, being able to store and return energy in that fashion.  Both energy shields were controlled by an emitter in the uniform's gloves, expanding only when needed.  Despite all these, however, Rogers has always returned to using the indestructible shield that is most associated with him, although he has admitted he found the versatility of the photon shield valuable in combat.

His costume is made of a fire-retardant material.  He also wears a light weight "duralumin" [[chainmail]] beneath his costume for added protection.   As a member of the [[Avengers]], Rogers has his Avengers priority card, which also serves as a communications device, on his person at all times.

==Alternate Captain Americas==
===Ultimate Captain America===
The [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] version of Captain America has superpowers, is more reactionary than his counterpart and is more prone to violent solutions as well as morally old-fashioned. 

In this version, Steve Rogers was a frail volunteer who underwent months of steroid treatment, surgery, and the Super-Soldier formula to become Captain America. Bucky was a childhood friend who followed him on his missions as a photographer and not a costumed sidekick. Rogers' last mission as Captain America sent him deep into [[Nazi Germany]] to stop a prototype hydrogen bomb created with alien technology. He caused the rocket carrying the bomb to explode, but fell into the freezing cold Arctic Ocean; rather than die from [[hypothermia]], Rogers fell into [[suspended animation]] until a fishing trawler pulled him out of the water 57 years later. Bucky survived the war, and, thinking that Rogers had been killed in action, married Rogers' fiancee, Gail. 

Rogers became one of the first members of the [[Ultimates]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s answer to battle [[posthuman]] [[terrorism]]. He began adjusting to life in the 21st century, although he still longed for older times and values, spending much time with Bucky and Gail (now senior citizens) as well as going to WWII veterans' reunions. Recently, events made it appear that Captain America was the one who had repeatedly betrayed the team over the course of the past year. The real traitor has since been revealed to be [[Ultimate Black Widow|the Black Widow]].

Rogers is at least as skilled in combat as his [[Earth-616]] counterpart. In addition, his strength is superhuman rather than just at peak human levels. In the Ultimate Universe, Bruce Banner became the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]] as a result of his experiments to recreate the Super-Soldier serum. Despite the Hulk being one of the strongest characters in the Ultimate Universe, Rogers was able to defeat Banner in hand-to-hand combat, bringing the Hulk down and out of the fight for a moment.  In addition, Rogers was also able to defeat [[Henry Pym]] in melee combat while Pym was in his Giant Man form, a size almost 60 feet high.

===Others===
Other alternate Captain Americas include several seen in issues of ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'', a comic featuring tales of alternate realities. In the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' comic books, the funny animal version of Captain America is Steve Mouse, an anthropomorphic cat that works for the Daily Beagle, who is also secretly Captain Americat. In a recent ''[[House of M]]'' crossover issue, another alternate Steve Rogers was featured, one who lived through World War II and was not frozen.

==Appearances in other media==
A 1944 movie [[serial]] called ''Captain America'' portrayed the hero as a district attorney named Grant Gardner and arbitrarily removed many other important elements of the character, such as his shield and his sidekick, Bucky. The 1966 syndicated [[animated TV series]] ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' included "Captain America" segments. The primitive animation was largely composed of stills photostatted from Jack Kirby art. There were two unexceptional 1979 [[TV movies]], ''Captain America'' and ''Captain America II: Death Too Soon'' starring Reb Brown. A direct-to-video movie, ''Captain America'' (1991), starring [[Matt Salinger]], earned highly negative reviews. It depicted the hero's battle against the Red Skull, who in the film was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[fascism|fascist]] rather than a German Nazi.  

Captain America made two appearances in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', in the episodes ''7 Little Superheroes'' and ''Pawns of the Kingpin'', and also appeared in an episode of its sister series, the syndicated ''Spider-Man''. He also appeared in the fifth season of the [[X-Men Animated Series]] to fend off Nazis as a fellow soldier and friend of Wolverine in the episode ''Old Soldiers''.

Captain America appeared in the 1990s [[Spider-Man]] animated television series, in the "Six Forgotten Warriors" and "Secret Wars" story arcs. In this version, while the original formula was lost, scientists were able to create 5 similar doses, which were given to 5 other Americans.  The formula, being imperfect, gave them all slightly different abilities and was also temporary.  The other five could turn off their powers using special rings, to keep from wasting them.  The six fought togther in World War two, until, Captain America and the Red Skull are trapped in an extra-dimensional stasis device, eternally fighting until they are briefly released.

Captain America (along with [[Nick Fury]]) also made an appearance in the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. In the episode ''Operation Rebirth'', Rogers got his abilities from a machine used as part of ''Project: Rebirth''.  During World War II, he participated in a joint operation with a Canadian soldier named [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]] to liberate a [[concentration camp]].  One of the prisoners was a boy named [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]].  After the attack, it was revealed that the ''Rebirth'' process was killing Rogers, so he and Logan destroyed the machine and Rogers was cryogenically frozen until a cure could be found.  Lehnsherr would grow up to become [[Magneto]] and acquire a duplicate of the Rebirth technology, having discovered it could be used safely on mutants to prolong their life and vitality. The duplicate technology was destroyed by Wolverine, Rogue, and Nightcrawler.

[[Image:Cap.gif|thumb|120px|[[Capcom]] fighting game version]]

Captain America has also appeared in several prose novels, notably 1998's ''Captain America: Liberty's Torch'' by [[Tony Isabella]] and [[Bob Ingersoll]], in which the hero is put on trial for the imagined crimes of America by a hostile militia group.

Captain America has appeared in several [[Computer and video games|video games]]. He was one of four [[playable character]]s in ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]'' (1991). He later appeared in [[Capcom]]'s [[Marvel Super-Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super-Heroes]] and the subsequent [[Marvel vs. Capcom series]], as well as ''Maximum Carnage'' and ''Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems''.

===Pop culture references===
The phrase "Captain America" has been used to refer ironically to American patriotic values, especially in [[rock music]]. The 1978 [[Kinks]] [[song]] "Catch Me Now, I'm Falling", about the ailing U.S. economy in the late 1970s, refers to "Captain America calling". [[Jam band]] [[moe.]] composed a song called "Captain America" which deals with Captain America as an authority figure. Jimmy Buffett recorded a song in 1977 titled "Captain America," offering a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the hero, replete with a kazoo solo, and the phrase, "He wears a mask, his clothes are weird, and some folks call him hokey. But he is hip, he just can't dig the [[Oklahoma|Okie]] from [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]]." The [[Guns N' Roses]]' song "[[Paradise City]]" also contains a reference to Captain America ("''Captain America's been torn apart...''"). The ''[[Roadrunner United]]'' album features a song titled "I Don't Wanna Be (A Superhero)" which contains the line, "They came from sea and they from the sky, Captain America is going to die."

Early [[Doonesbury]] strips have [[Zonker Harris]] referring sardonically to the [[B.D.]], captain of the football team on which they both play, as "Cap'n America sir."

The Marine Recon unit in [[Evan Wright]]'s 2005 [[nonfiction]] bestseller ''[[Generation Kill]]'' derisively referred to their overzealous commander as Captain America. 

[[Peter Fonda]]'s character in the iconic 1969 film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' was nicknamed "Captain America." According to the "making of" feature on the [[DVD]] edition of the film, director [[Dennis Hopper]] described the two motorcyclists of the film to actor [[Robert Walker, Jr.]], who said "they sound like Captain American and Bucky" and Hopper liked the name. 

In the 1997 film ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'', [[Will Smith]]'s character refers to an overzealous Army lieutenant as "Captain America".

In the film ''[[Armageddon (film)|Armageddon]]'', an overzealous military man is referred to as "Captain America".

In Britain, [[United States men's national soccer team|United States soccer captain]] [[Claudio Reyna]] is often referred to as Captain America.

==Fan awards==
The series was nominated for the Wizard Fan Award for Comics' Greatest Moment in 2002 for when "Captain American kills [[Al-Tariq]]" in Captain America #3.
