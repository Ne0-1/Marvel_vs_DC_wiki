'''Captain America''' is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]], created by American [[cartoonists]] [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941 from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]. Designed as a patriotic superhero who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of World War II, Captain America was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period.  The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953.  Since [[Marvel Comics]] revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.

Captain America wears a costume that bears an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif]], and is armed with a [[Captain America's shield|nearly indestructible shield]] that he throws at foes.  The character is usually depicted as the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the [[United States]] government's imminent efforts in [[World War II]]. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day to subsequently become the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Captain America was the first Marvel Comics to have appeared in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]] ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]''. Since then, the character has been featured in such other films and television series, more recently in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) portrayed by [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] in  ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' and the upcoming ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Further2|[[List of Captain America titles]]}}

===Golden Age===
In 1940, writer [[Joe Simon]] conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.<ref>1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover</ref> "I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page," Simon said in his autobiography, and then considered that, 
{{quote|No, it didn't work. There were too many 'Supers' around. 'Captain America' had a good sound to it. There weren't a lot of captains in comics. It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team."<ref name=joesimonp50>{{Cite book |last= Simon|first= Joe|author2=Simon, Jim|title= The Comic Book Makers|publisher= Crestwood/II|year= 1990|page= 50|isbn= 978-1-887591-35-5}} Reissued by Vanguard Productions in 2003.</ref>}}

Simon recalled in his autobiography that [[Timely Comics]] publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] gave him the go-ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:

{{quote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp;... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. 'You're still number one, Jack,' I assured him. 'It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.'}}

{{quote|'I'll make the deadline,' Jack promised. 'I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.' I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp;... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby.}}

{{quote|I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and pepping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}

[[File:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|left|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon's original sketch of Captain America.]]
[[Al Liederman]] would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>

Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: "The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too."<ref name="Wright 36">{{Cite book |last= Wright| first= Bradford W.|title=Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America | publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year= 2001|isbn= 978-0-8018-7450-5|page= 36}}</ref>

Simon noted, "When the first issue came out we got a lot of&nbsp;... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for."<ref name="Wright 36"/> The threats, which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was posted with [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Fiorello La Guardia]] personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cronin|first = Brian|title = Was Superman a Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher = Plume|year = 2009|pages = 135–136|isbn = 978-0-452-29532-2}}</ref>

Though preceded as a "patriotically themed superhero" by [[Archie Comics|MLJ]]'s [[The Shield (Archie)|The Shield]], Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II,<ref name="Sanderson18">{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 18|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Cap was not the first patriotically themed super hero, but he would become the most enduring. He was Timely's most popular hero with nearly a million copies of his comic sold per month.}}</ref> as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first. This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the character's triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character. In response, Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2, which went on to become an iconic element of the character.<ref>Cronin, p. 134</ref> With his sidekick [[Bucky]], Captain America faced [[Nazism|Nazis]], [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], and other threats to wartime America and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Stanley Lieber, now better known as [[Stan Lee]], contributed to the character in issue #3 in the filler text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge", which introduced the character's use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon.<ref name="AmazingMarvelUniverse">{{Cite book |last= Thomas|first= Roy|authorlink = Roy Thomas|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe| publisher= Sterling Publishing|location= New York|year= 2006|page= 11|isbn= 978-1-4027-4225-5|quote= The line reads: "With the speed of thought, he sent his shield spinning through the air to the other end of the tent, where it smacked the knife out of Haines' hand!" It became a convention starting the following issue, in which the art in a Simon and Kirby comics story illustrates the following caption: "Captain America's speed of thought and action save Bucky's life — as he hurls his shield across the room.}}</ref> Captain America soon became Timely's most popular character and even had a fan-club called the "Sentinels of Liberty."<ref name="Wright 36"/>

Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue, which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' during the period.<ref name="Sanderson18" /><ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]]|year = 1991|page = 37|isbn = 9780810938212}}</ref> After the Simon and Kirby team moved to [[DC Comics]] in late 1941, having produced ''Captain America Comics'' through issue #10 (January 1942), [[Al Avison]] and [[Syd Shores]] became regular [[penciller]]s of the celebrated title, with one generally [[inker|inking]] over the other. The character was featured in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #1-19 (Summer 1941 – Fall 1946), ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #80-84 and #86-92, ''[[USA Comics]]'' #6-17 (Dec. 1942 – Fall 1945), and ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #1-10 (Fall 1943 – Summer 1946).

In the post-war era, with the popularity of superheroes fading, Captain America led Timely's first superhero team, the [[All-Winners Squad]], in its two published adventures, in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #19 and #21 (Fall–Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). After Bucky was shot and wounded in a 1948 ''Captain America'' story, he was succeeded by Captain America's girlfriend, Betsy Ross, who became the superheroine [[Golden Girl]]. ''Captain America Comics'' ran until issue #73 (July 1949),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/237/ ''Captain America Comics''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> at which time the series was retitled ''Captain America's Weird Tales'' for two issues,<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/238/ ''Captain America's Weird Tales''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> with the finale being a horror/suspense anthology issue with no superheroes.

[[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America, along with the original Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner, in ''Young Men'' #24 (Dec. 1953). Billed as "Captain America, Commie Smasher!"<!--note: This is a cover nickname on all his 1950s comics, and presented in all caps like "Daredevil, The Man Without Fear." And in any case, "Commie," short for "Communist," a proper noun, is always capped--> Captain America appeared during the next year in ''Young Men'' #24-28 and ''Men's Adventures'' #27-28, as well as in issues #76-78 of an eponymous title. Atlas' attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure,<ref>Wright, p. 123.</ref> and the character's title was canceled with ''Captain America'' #78 (Sept. 1954).

===Silver Age revival===
In the [[Human Torch]] story titled "Captain America" in Marvel Comics' ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #114 (Nov. 1963),<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 95: "As the Human Torch had been instrumental in bringing back the Sub-Mariner in ''The Fantastic Four'' #4 (May 1962), it seemed only natural that he would help usher in Captain America."</ref> writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]] depicted the brash young [[Fantastic Four]] member Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, in an exhibition performance with Captain America, described as a legendary World War II and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement. The 18-page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor: it was actually the villain the [[Acrobat (comics)|Acrobat]], a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in ''Strange Tales'' #106, who broke two thieves out of jail, hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank. Afterward, Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers. A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return.

Captain America was then formally reintroduced in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #4 (March 1964),<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 99: "'Captain America lives again!' announced the cover of ''The Avengers'' #4. A mere [four] months after his imposter had appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #114, the real Cap was back."</ref> which explained that in the final days of World War II, he had fallen from an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] and spent decades frozen in a block of ice in a state of [[suspended animation]]. The hero found a new generation of readers as leader of that superhero team. Following the success of other Marvel characters introduced during the 1960s, Captain America was recast as a hero "haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society."<ref>Wright, p. 215.</ref>

After then guest-starring in the feature "[[Iron Man]]" in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #58 (Oct. 1964), Captain America gained his own solo feature in that "split book," beginning the following issue.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 103</ref> Issue #63 (March 1965), which retold Captain America's origin, through issue #71 (Nov. 1965) was a period feature set during World War II and co-starred Captain America's Golden Age sidekick, Bucky. Kirby drew all but two of the stories in ''Tales of Suspense,'' which became ''Captain America'' with #100 (April 1968);<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles: ''Tales of Suspense'' #99 was followed by ''Captain America'' #100."</ref> [[Gil Kane]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]], each filled in once. Several stories were finished by penciller-inker [[George Tuska]] over Kirby layouts, with one finished by Romita Sr. and another by penciller [[Dick Ayers]] and inker [[John Tartaglione]]. Kirby's regular inkers on the series were [[Frank Giacoia]] (as "Frank Ray") and [[Joe Sinnott]], though [[Don Heck]] and Golden Age Captain America artist [[Syd Shores]] inked one story each. The new title ''Captain America'' continued to feature artwork by Kirby, as well as a short run by [[Jim Steranko]], and work by many of the industry's top artists and writers. It was called ''Captain America and the Falcon'' from #134 (Feb. 1971) to #222 (June 1978)<ref name="Olshevsky">{{cite journal|last = Olshevsky|first = George|authorlink = George Olshevsky|title = Heroes From ''Tales of Suspense'', Book One: Captain America|magazine = The Marvel Comics Index|issue = 8A|pages = 64 and 93|publisher = G&T Enterprises|date = December 1979}}</ref> although the Falcon's name was not on the cover for issues #193, 200, and 216. The 1972–1975 run on the title by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]] saw the series become one of Marvel's top-sellers.<ref>{{cite book|last = Amash|first = Jim|title = Sal Buscema: Comics' Fast & Furious Artist|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2010|page = 46|isbn = 978-1-60549-021-2|quote= When Steve and I [Sal Buscema] got on the book&nbsp;... if I remember correctly, the book hit #5 in sales.

This series — considered ''Captain America'' volume one by comics researchers and historians,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer2.htm#S35 | title= ''Captain America'' (1968–1996) |publisher=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators}} and [http://www.comics.org/series/1860/ ''Captain America''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> following the 1940s ''Captain America Comics'' and its 1950s numbering continuation of ''Tales of Suspense'' — ended with #454 (Aug. 1996).

===After the Silver Age===
This series was almost immediately followed by the 13-issue ''Captain America'' vol. 2 (Nov. 1996 – Nov. 1997, part of the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" crossover),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer5.htm#S380| title= ''Captain America'' (II) (1996–1997)| publisher=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators}} and [http://www.comics.org/series/5542/ ''Captain America'' vol. 2] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> the 50-issue ''Captain America'' vol. 3 (Jan. 1998 – Feb. 2002),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer5.htm#S460 | title=''Captain America'' (III) (1998–2002) | publisher=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators}} and [http://www.comics.org/series/6023/ ''Captain America'' vol. 3] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> the 32-issue ''Captain America'' vol. 4 (June 2002 – Dec. 2004),<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer9.htm#S3485| title=''Captain America'' (IV) (2002–2004) | publisher=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators}} and [http://www.comics.org/series/9818/ ''Captain America'' vol. 4] at the grand Comics Database</ref> and ''Captain America'' vol. 5 (Jan. 2005 – Aug. 2011).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/capamer7.htm#S4744 | title= ''Captain America'' (V) (2005–2007) | publisher=The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators}} and [http://www.comics.org/series/12466/ ''Captain America'' vol. 5] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> Beginning with the 600th overall issue (Aug. 2009), ''Captain America'' resumed its original numbering, as if the series numbering had continued uninterrupted after #454.

As part of the aftermath of Marvel Comics' company-crossover storyline "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]",<!--the CROSSOVER STORY ARC is in quote marks; the actual one comic book SERIES titled is in italics--> Steve Rogers was ostensibly killed in ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #25 (March 2007). Series writer [[Ed Brubaker]] remarked, "What I found is that all the really hard-core left-wing fans want Cap to be standing out on and giving speeches on the street corner against the [[George W.

The character, first as agent Steve Rogers and later after resuming his identity as Captain America, appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). The character appeared as agent Steve Rogers as a regular character in the 2010–2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through issue #21 (March 2012); the character made guest appearances as Captain America in issues #21.1, #22-23, #35, and the final issue of the series #37 (March 2013).

Marvel stated in May 2011 that Rogers, following the public death of Bucky Barnes in the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' miniseries, would resume his Captain America identity in a sixth volume of ''Captain America'', by writer Ed Brubaker and artist [[Steve McNiven]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/05/30/captain-america-brubaker-mcniven-preview|title= Steve Rogers Returns to Duty with Brubaker & McNiven in ''Captain America'' #1|first= Andy|last= Khouri|date= May 30, 2011|publisher= ComicsAlliance.com|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6GBSJxxHy|archivedate= April 26, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= June 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/59241/ ''Captain America'' vol. 6] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> The ''Captain America'' title continued from issue #620 featuring team up stories with Bucky (#620-#628),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/59240/ ''Captain America and Bucky''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> Hawkeye (#629-#632),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/64742/ ''Captain America and Hawkeye''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> Iron Man (#633-635),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/66557/ ''Captain America and Iron Man''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> Namor (#635.1),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/68207/ ''Captain America and Namor''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> and Black Widow (#636-#640),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/68401/ ''Captain America and Black Widow''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> and the title ended its print run with issue #640.

On July 16, 2014 Marvel Comics announced that the mantle of Captain America would be passed on by Rogers (who in the most recent storyline has been turned into a 90-year-old man) to his long-time ally [[Falcon (comics)|The Falcon]] to which the series will be relaunced as ''All-New Captain America''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/new-captain-america-african-american-article-1.1869686|title= New Captain America will be African-American, as the Falcon takes over the star-spangled mantle in the comic books|first= Ethan|last= Sacks|date= July 17, 2014|publisher= ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141022031235/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/new-captain-america-african-american-article-1.1869686|archivedate= October 22, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Legal status===

In 1966 Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics, asserting that he – not Marvel – was legally entitled to renew the [[copyright]] upon the expiration of the original 28-year term.  The two parties settled out of court, with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher, and therefore it was [[work for hire]] owned by them.<ref name=philly>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica|work=The Philadelphia Lawyer| publisher= Philadelphia Bar Association |accessdate=6 August 2013|title=The Struggle for Captain America|last=Lovitz|first=Michael | archivedate= December 2, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222355/http://www.philadelphiabar.org/page/TPLSummer03CaptainAmerica | deadurl=no}}</ref>

In 1999, Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56-year copyright term (but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation) had expired.  Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim, arguing that the settlement of Simon's 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer.  Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003, in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character.<ref name=philly/><ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Simon, a Creator of Captain America, Fighting On |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/books/16gust.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=George Gene | last = Gustines | accessdate=6 August 2013}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===1940s===
[[File:Captainamerica1.jpg|thumb|''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941). Cover art by [[Joe Simon]] (inks and pencils) and [[Jack Kirby]] (pencils).|alt=The front page of the first Captain America comic depicts Captain America punching [[Adolf Hitler]] in the jaw. A Nazi soldier's bullet deflects from Captain America's shield, while Adolf Hitler falls onto a map of the [[United States of America]] and a document reading 'Sabotage plans for U.S.A.']]
Steven Rogers was born in the 1920s in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], to poor [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, Sarah and Joseph Rogers.<ref name="sentinel">{{cite comic| writer= [[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]]|penciller= [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Maguire, Kevin]]|inker= [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Joe]]|story= First Flight of the Eagle|title= The Adventures of Captain America|issue= 1|date= September 1991}}</ref> Joseph died when Steve was a child, and Sarah died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen. By early 1940, before America's entry into [[World War II]], Rogers is a tall, scrawny [[fine art]]s student specializing in illustration, and a comic book writer and artist.

Disturbed by the rise of the [[Third Reich]], Rogers attempts to enlist but is rejected due to his frail body. His resolution attracts the notice of U.S. Army General [[Chester Phillips]] and "Project: Rebirth." Rogers is used as a test subject for the [[Supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] project, receiving a special serum made by "Dr. Josef Reinstein",<ref name="captainamericacomics1">{{cite comic| writer= [[Joe Simon|Simon, Joe]]; [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Al Liederman|Liederman, Al]]|story= Case No. 1.

The serum is a success and transforms Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength, agility, stamina, and intelligence. The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings.<ref name="modernorigin"/> The process itself has been inconsistently detailed: while in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum, when the origin was retold in the 1960s, the [[Comic Code Authority]] had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse, and thus the Super-Serum was retconned into an oral formula.<ref name="tos origin">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]]|story= The Origin of Captain America!|title= [[Tales of Suspense]]|issue= 63|date= March 1965}}</ref> Later accounts hint at a combination of oral and intravenous treatments with a strenuous training regimen, culminating in the Vita-Ray exposure.

Erskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment, leaving behind a flawed, imperfect knowledge of the  steps. Thus, when the Nazi [[secret agent|spy]] [[Heinz Kruger]] killed him, Erskine's method of creating new Super-Soldiers died. Captain America, in his first act after his transformation, avenges Erskine. In the 1941 origin story and in ''Tales of Suspense'' #63, Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers; in the ''Captain America'' #109 and #255 revisions, Rogers causes the spy's death by punching him into machinery.<ref name="modernorigin"/>

Unable to create new Super-Soldiers and willing to hide the Project Rebirth fiasco, the American government casts Rogers as a patriotic superhero, able to counter the menace of the [[Red Skull]] as a [[counter-intelligence]] agent. He is supplied with a patriotic uniform designed by Rogers,<ref name="sentinel"/> a bulletproof shield, a personal [[side arm]], and the codename Captain America, while posing as a clumsy [[infantry]] private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia. He forms a friendship with the camp's teenage [[mascot]], James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes.<ref name="captainamericacomics1"/>

Barnes learns of Rogers' [[secret identity|dual identity]] and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain America's [[sidekick]]. During their adventures, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] presents Captain America with [[Captain America's shield|a new shield]], forged from an alloy of [[steel]] and [[vibranium]], fused by an unknown catalyst, so effective that it replaces his own firearm.<ref name="stern origin"/> Throughout World War II, Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name.<ref name="invaders">{{cite comic| writer= [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]]|penciller= [[Frank Robbins|Robbins, Frank]]|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= A Captain Called America|title= [[Invaders (comics)|Giant-Size Invaders]]|issue= 1|date= June 1975}}</ref> Captain America battles a number of criminal menaces on American soil, including a wide variety of costumed villains: the Wax Man,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= The Wax Statue That Struck Death|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 2|date= April 1941}}</ref> the Hangman,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= The Strange Case of Captain America and The Hangman: Who Killed Doctor Vordoff|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 6|date= September 1941}}</ref> the Fang,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= Meet the Fang, Arch-Fiend of the Orient|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 6|date= September 1941}}</ref> the Black Talon,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Otto Binder|Binder, Otto]]|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Shores, Syd|story= The Case of the Black Talon|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 9|date= December 1941}}</ref> and the White Death,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Simon, Joe; Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Simon, Joe|story= The White Death|title= Captain America Comics|issue= 9|date= December 1941}}</ref> among others.

In addition to Bucky, Captain America was occasionally assisted by the [[Sentinels of Liberty]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dittmer|first=Jason|title=``America is safe while its boys and girls believe in its creeds!'': Captain America and American identity prior to World War 2|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|date=March 23, 2007|volume=25|pages=401–423|doi=10.1068/d1905}}</ref>  Sentinels of Liberty was the title given to members of the ''Captain America Comics'' fan club who Captain America sometimes addressed as an aside, or as characters in the ''Captain America Comics'' stories.

In late April 1945, during the closing days of World War II, Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous [[Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental drone plane. Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. The pair reaches the plane just before take off. When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb, it explodes in mid-air. Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic. Both are presumed dead, though it is later revealed that neither one died.<ref name="theavengers4"/>

===Late 1940s to 1950s===
Captain America appeared in comics for the next few years, changing from World War II-era hero fighting the Nazis to confronting the United States' newest enemy, [[Communism]]. The revival of the character in the mid-1950s was short-lived, and events during that time period are later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character. These post World War II successors are listed as [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|William Naslund]] and [[Jeffrey Mace]].

The last of these other official Captains, William Burnside,<ref name="cap602">{{cite comic| writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]]|penciller= [[Luke Ross|Ross, Luke]]|inker= [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Butch]]; Ross, Luke|story= Two Americas Part 1|title= Captain America|issue= 602|date= March 2010}}</ref> was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos, having his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally changing his name to "Steve Rogers", becoming the new "1950s Captain America".<ref name="CA153">{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]]|penciller= [[Sal Buscema|Buscema, Sal]]|inker= [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]|story= Captain America--Hero Or Hoax?|title= Captain America|issue= 153|date= September 1972}}</ref> He self-administered to himself and his pupil [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|James "Jack" Monroe]] a flawed, incomplete copy of the Super-Serum, which made no mention about the necessary Vita-Ray portion of the treatment. As a result, while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky, they became violently paranoid, often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the [[Red Scare]] of the 1950s. Their insanity forced the U.S. government to place them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness.<ref name="CA156">{{cite comic| writer= Englehart, Steve|penciller= Buscema, Sal|inker= [[Frank McLaughlin (comics)|McLaughlin, Frank]]|story= One Into Two Won't Go!|title= Captain America|issue= 156|date= December 1972}}</ref> Monroe would later be cured and assume the Nomad identity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[J.

Years later, the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] discovers Steve Rogers' body in the North Atlantic. After he revives, they piece together that Rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since 1945, surviving because of his enhancements from Project: Rebirth. The block began to melt after the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], enraged that an [[Inuit]] tribe is worshipping the frozen figure, throws it into the ocean.<ref name="theavengers4">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= Captain America Joins&nbsp;...

Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Bucky's death. Although he takes the young [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (who closely resembles Bucky) under his tutelage, he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity, not wishing to be responsible for another youth's death. Insisting that his hero move on from that loss, Jones convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= [[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]]|inker= [[Joe Sinnott|Sinnott, Joe]]|story= No Longer Alone!|title= Captain America|issue= 110|date= February 1969}}</ref> but this partnership lasts only a short time; a disguised [[Red Skull]], impersonating Rogers with the help of the [[Cosmic Cube]], drives Jones away.

Rogers reunites with his old war comrade [[Nick Fury]], who is similarly well-preserved due to the "Infinity Formula." As a result, Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for which Fury is public director.<ref name="tos78">{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Giacoia, Frank|story= Them!|title= Tales of Suspense|issue= 78|date= June 1966}}</ref> Through Fury, Rogers befriends [[Sharon Carter]], a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby,, Jack; Ayers, Dick|inker= [[John Tartaglione|Tartaglione, John]]|story= 30 Minutes to Live!|title= Tales of Suspense|issue= 75|date= March 1966}}</ref> with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship.

Following Gruenwald's departure from the series, Mark Waid took over and resurrected Sharon Carter as Cap's love interest. The title was then relaunched under Rob Liefeld as Cap became part of the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe for 13 issues<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: "Steve Rogers earned a fresh start in the Heroes Reborn universe by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Rob Liefeld."</ref> before another relaunch restored Waid to the title<ref>Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 288: "Writer Mark Waid began what many fans atill consider to be the ultimate run on the ''Captain America'' title with this series penciled by Ron Garney."</ref> in an arc that saw Cap lose his shield for a time using an energy based shield as a temporary replacement. Following Waid's run, Dan Jurgens took over and introduced new foe [[Protocide]], a failed recipient of the Super Soldier serum prior to the experiment that successfully created Rogers.

===2000s===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]], Rogers reveals his identity to the world and establishes a residence in the [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], as seen in ''Captain America'' vol. 4, #1-7 (June 2002 – Feb. 2003).<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 312: "The darker Marvel Knights line of books accepted Steve Rogers under their umbrella as writer John Ney Rieber and artist John Cassaday restarted the series with a new first issue."</ref> Following the disbandment of the Avengers in the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" story arc, Rogers, now employed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], discovers Bucky is alive, having been saved and deployed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] as the [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]]. Rogers resumes his on-again, off-again relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Sharon Carter]].

In the 2006–2007 company-wide story arc "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]",<!--the STORY ARC is in quote marks; the actual one comic-book SERIES title is in italics--> and its anchoring, seven-issue miniseries, ''Civil War'' (July 2006 - Jan. 2007), Rogers opposes the new mandatory [[Registration Acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|federal registration of super-powered beings]], and leads the underground anti-registration movement. After significant rancor and danger to the public as the two sides clash, Captain America voluntarily surrenders and orders the Anti-Registration forces to stand down.
[[File:capdeath.PNG|thumb|Steve Rogers' presumed death. Art by [[Steve Epting]].]]
In the story arc "[[The Death of Captain America]]", Rogers is indicted on criminal charges for his anti-registration efforts, and in ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #25 (April 2007) is shot outside a federal courthouse; taken to a hospital, he is pronounced dead.<ref>Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 335: "Surprising an unsuspecting fan base who thought the worst was over for Steve Rogers, Captain America's death captured worldwide media attention."</ref> The assassination, orchestrated by the Red Skull, involves [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] as a sniper and [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Dr. Faustus]], who poses as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] psychiatrist and gives Carter a hypnotic suggestion to surreptitiously shoot Rogers at close range during the chaos surrounding the sniper shot.

The miniseries ''[[Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America]]'' #1-5 (June–Aug. 2007) follows the stunned superhero community after the apparent assassination. Captain America is purportedly laid to rest in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], but Tony Stark (Iron Man) and others have actually returned Rogers' body to the [[Arctic]] where Rogers had been found years before, and whereupon Namor swore to guard him. In ''Captain America'' vol. 5, #30 (Sept. 2007), Stark, who previously had tried to convince close friend and colleague of both Rogers and Stark, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]] to take up the role, receives a letter containing Rogers' request that Bucky become the next Captain America, which Bucky agrees to do four issues later. Adopting the original shield, he dons a new costume incorporating a pistol and a knife. The [[Norse god]] superhero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] communicates with what appears to be Rogers' spirit on the first anniversary of Rogers' death, in ''Thor'' vol. 3, #11 (Oct. 2008).
[[File:Steve Rogers Super Soldier.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional art for ''Steve Rogers: Super Soldier'' #1 (Sept. 2010) by [[Carlos Pacheco]] and [[Tim Townsend]].]]
''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' #1 (Aug. 2009) reveals that Rogers did not die, and that the gun Sharon Carter had been hypnotized to use had caused Rogers to phase in and out of space and time, appearing at events in his lifetime and fighting battles. The Skull returns Rogers to the present, where he takes control of Rogers' mind and body. Rogers eventually regains control, and with help from his allies, defeats the Skull in the fourth and final issues of this miniseries. In the subsequent [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic ''Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield?'', Rogers formally grants Bucky his Captain America shield and asks his former sidekick to continue as Captain America. The American President grants Rogers a full [[pardon]] for his anti-registration actions.

After Cyclops was incarcerated, and Steve accepted the Avengers should've done more to help mutants, and allowed the world to hate them, he started planning a new sub-team of Avengers in the hopes of unifying mutant and humankind alike. He chose [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] to lead his team and become the new face to represent mutants as [[Professor X]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] once were.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Their first threat was the return of [[Red Skull]], who usurped Professor X's body to provide himself with telepathic powers, which he would use to provoke citizens of New York into a mass assault against mutants, or anyone who could be one, and force [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] to allow themselves to be attacked. With the help of the S-Man Honest John, he managed to even manipulate [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].{{issue|date=September 2014}}

However, Red Skull's skills where still erratic, and couldn't completely control Captain America, an attack against him was enough of a distraction to lose control on Rogue and Scarlet Witch.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:CAtransformation.png|thumb|Steve Rogers' physical transformation, from a reprint of ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March [[1941 in comics|1941]]). Art by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]].]]

Captain America has no superhuman powers, but through the Super-Soldier Serum and "Vita-Ray" treatment, he is transformed and his strength, endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, durability, and healing are at the zenith of natural human potential. Rogers' body regularly replenishes the super-soldier serum; it does not wear off.<ref name="CA378" />

The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of [[lactic acid|fatigue poisons]] in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1200 pounds (545&nbsp;kg) and running a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in 73 seconds (49&nbsp;mph/78 kph).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= [[Javier Pulido|Pulido, Javier]]; [[Marcos Martín|Martín, Marcos]]; [[Mike Perkins|Perkins, Mike]]|inker= Pulido, Javier; Martín, Marcos; Perkins, Mike|story= Secrets of Iron & Fire|title= Captain America 65th Anniversary Special|issue= 1|date= May 2006}}</ref> Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek, Kurt]]|penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]|inker= Pérez, George|story= Book Four: The Brave and the Bold|title= [[JLA/Avengers|Avengers/JLA]]|issue= 4|date= March 2005}}</ref> The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator, Dr. Abraham Erskine.<ref name="tos origin" /> In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine's treatment, only to have them end in failure. Even worse, the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America's [[Grand Director|1950s imitator]] and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] are the most notorious examples.

Rogers' battle experience and training make him an expert [[Military tactics|tactician]] and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle. Thor has stated that Rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow "through the gates of Hades".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter,, Jim]]|penciller= Zeck, Mike|inker= Beatty, John|story= The War Begins|title= [[Secret Wars|Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars]]|issue= 1|date= May 1984}}</ref> Rogers' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen. He has blended [[judo]], [[Boxing|western boxing]], [[kickboxing]], and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts. Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy. His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a [[boomerang]]-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind. In canon, he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best [[hand-to-hand combat]]ants in the Marvel Universe, limited only by his human physique.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carlin|Carlin, Mike]]|penciller= Neary,, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= And Other Strangers|title= Captain America|issue= 302|date= February 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gruenwald, Mark|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Bulandi, Danny|story= The Devil You Know|title= Captain America|issue= 375|date= Late August 1990}}</ref> Although the super-soldier serum is an important part of his strength, Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents, even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre-Captain America physique.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= [[Dale Eaglesham|Eaglesham, Dale]]|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= For a lot of my childhood&nbsp;... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 3|date= November 2010}}</ref>

Rogers has vast [[U.S. military]] knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. Despite his high profile as one of the world's most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community, largely through his ongoing relationship with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] He is a talented artist, and has worked on the ''Captain America'' comic book published in the Marvel universe. Other career fields include commercial arts, teaching high school history, and law enforcement.

Although he lacks superhuman strength, Captain America is one of the few mortal beings who has been deemed worthy enough to wield Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]|penciller= [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]]|inker= [[Brett Breeding|Breeding, Brett]]|story= The Hero and the Hammer|title= [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]|issue= 390|date= April 1988}}</ref>

===Weapons and equipment===
{{Further2|[[Captain America's shield]]}}
[[File:CapShield05.jpg|thumbnail|right|An example of Captain America's shield]]
Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history, the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from an experimental [[alloy]] of steel and the fictional [[vibranium]].<ref name="CA303">{{cite comic| writer= [[Mike Carlin|Carlin, Mike]]|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Double Dare|title= Captain America|issue= 303|date= March 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Carlin, Mike|penciller= Neary, Paul|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= Undercover of the Night|title= Captain America|issue= 304|date= April 1985}}</ref> The shield was cast by American metallurgist [[Dr. Myron MacLain]], who was contracted by the U.S. government, from orders of [[President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II.<ref name="CA303" /> This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of [[adamantium]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|penciller= [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Smith,, Barry]]|inker= Shores, Syd|story= Betrayal|title= The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]|issue= 66|date= July 1969}}</ref>

Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon. The first instance of Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss occurs in [[Stan Lee]]'s first comics writing, the two-page text story "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge" in ''Captain America Comics'' #3 (May 1941).<ref name="AmazingMarvelUniverse" /> The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time-traveling mutant superhero [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures; Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Nicieza, Fabian|penciller= Medina, Lan|inker= Tadeo, Ed|story= Living Legends|title= [[Cable & Deadpool]]|issue= 25|date= April 2006}}</ref>

When without his trademark shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|penciller= [[Ron Garney|Garney, Ron]]|inker= [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]]|story= Museum Piece|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 3|date= March 1998}}</ref> or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Waid, Mark|penciller= [[Andy Kubert|Kubert, Andy]]|inker= [[Jesse Delperdang|Delperdang, Jesse]]|story= American Nightmare, Chapter One: The Bite of Madness!|title= Captain America|volume= 3|issue= 9|date= September 1998}}</ref> Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brubaker, Ed|penciller= Eaglesham, Dale|inker= Eaglesham, Dale|story= In 1940, the first Professor Erskine created what became&nbsp;... |title= Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier|issue= 4|date= December 2010}}</ref> Much like his vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= McCann, Jim|penciller= Diaz, Paco; [[Nick Dragotta|Dragotta, Nick]]|inker= Diaz, Paco; Dragotta, Nick|story= Off-Target!|title= Hawkeye: Blindspot|issue= 2|date= May 2011}}</ref>

Captain America's uniform is made of a fire-retardant material, and he wears a lightweight, bulletproof [[duralumin]] [[Mail (armour)|scale armor]] beneath his uniform for added protection.<ref name="stern origin"/> Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.

Captain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.

{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}
Captain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideals contrary to the American values Captain America is shown to strive for and believe. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ([[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]]), [[Neo-Nazism]] ([[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]), technocratic fascism ([[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], [[Arnim Zola]]), Communism ([[Aleksander Lukin]]), anarchism ([[Flag Smasher]]), and international and domestic terrorism ([[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]).
