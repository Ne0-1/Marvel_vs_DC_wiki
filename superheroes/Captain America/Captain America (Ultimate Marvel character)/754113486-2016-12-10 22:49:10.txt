'''Ultimate Captain America''' ('''Steve Rogers''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] comic book superhero appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is an [[Alternative versions of Captain America|alternative version]] of the [[mainstream Marvel continuity]] [[Captain America]] that appears in Marvel's [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate line]] of books. The character first appeared in ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'' #1 (March 2002), and was created by writer [[Mark Millar]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]] (based upon the original version of the character by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]).

==Fictional character biography==
Steve Rogers grew up in Brooklyn during the Great Depression, a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend [[Bucky#Other versions|"Bucky" Barnes]]. Horrified by newsreel footage of the Nazis in Europe, Rogers was inspired to enlist in the Army around the time the United States entered World War II. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when Military Sergeant Dugan recruited him for Project: Rebirth after hearing Rogers pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by Doctor Erskine, Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart Gail Richards, becoming "Captain America".<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Artist = Jackson Guice | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Origins #2 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

For the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside [[Ultimate Wolverine|James "Lucky Jim" Howlett]]. During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate [[Arnim Zola#Ultimate Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]'s facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed "Siegsoldat" ("Victory soldier"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{Cite comic | Writer = Charlie Huston | Artist = Mike Deodato | Colorist = Rainier Beredo | Title = Ultimates Annual #2 | Date = August 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> During one of his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent the night together, which would later result in her becoming pregnant.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Carlos Pacheco | Colorist = Justin Ponsor | Title = Ultimate Avengers #2 | Date = September 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He would later come into battle with [[Herr Kleiser]], who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House. However they were too late to stop the bomb from launching, but Captain America managed to get to the bomb as it is launched. In a successful attempt to stop it in mid air, he fell into the sea and was presumed dead.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Paul Mounts | Title = Ultimates #1 | Date = March 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Like his Earth 616 counterpart, Ultimate Captain America underwent the super soldier procedure which turned him into America's first super soldier. Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, however,  Ultimate Captain America's physical attributes have been augmented to superhuman, rather than peak human, levels. On a number of occasions characters have described his strength as enhanced (Nick Fury described him as being able to bench press a Toyota). He has been shown bending steel with his bare hands, catching a tree heavy enough to crush a Jeep. He is also shown jumping large distances, and the Ultimate Red Skull, when he was fourteen and scientists said he had abilities comparable to his father, is shown running alongside a motorcycle.

Captain America is also shown to have fast healing, while nowhere near as powerful as Wolverine and Sabretooth's, in "Blade vs the Ultimates" a remembrance by Cap shows scientists saying he can heal gunshots and knife wounds in hours. And Cap himself in Ultimates volume 1 says he should be able to heal broken bones in about a day or two.

===[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]===
Years after, the body of Captain America was found in the Arctic Ocean frozen in a block of ice. It was as if he had not aged a day. It has yet to be revealed whether it was due to cryogenic preservation or the super soldier serum that prevented him from aging.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Paul Mounts | Title = Ultimates #2 | Date = April 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Initially he thought [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] were a group of Nazi soldiers who had  captured him, but eventually realized that he was in a different time after seeing a modern New York City.

Rogers was able to put down the Hulk briefly during combat. When he was about to inject the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] with an antidote, Hulk made a surprise attack and broke the needle and Hulk then began beating Cap, until [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] came to the rescue. After Hulk had reverted to Banner, Cap knocked him out and had him taken back to the [[Triskelion]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Paul Mounts | Title = Ultimates #5 | Date = July 2002 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===[[The Ultimates 2]]===
Cap and the Ultimates were later under fire from the press and public due to the belief that Thor had revealed that Bruce Banner was indeed the Hulk.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #1 | Date = December 2004 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> In a meeting with Thor, Thor brought up the fact that Captain America killed many people and still goes to church, saying that he's confused with his morals.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #2 | Date = January 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The Ultimates fought Thor and eventually captured him when his power belt was removed by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #4 | Date = March 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #5 | Date = April 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> From then on the Ultimates became involved in foreign affairs wherein America attempted to control Third World countries' nuclear resources.<ref name="U27"/>

The Ultimates' actions led to Third World countries forming their own superhuman team, dubbed "the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]]".<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #9 | Date = December 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Captain America was framed by [[Ultimate Black Widow|Black Widow]] for the assassination of [[Ultimate Hawkeye|Hawkeye]]'s family and was hastily subdued and arrested when he was visiting Bucky for consolation after his relationship with Janet Pym ended bitterly for him.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #8 | Date = September 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> He was imprisoned in the [[Triskelion]].

Captain dueled with his Liberators counterpart, The Colonel, and emerged victorious after stabbing the Colonel in the chest with one end of the double-bladed [[energy sword]] that the Colonel used.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #12 | Date = September 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

After the Liberators are defeated, Steven Rogers somberly looked over the Colonel's body being transferred away by S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought of what he said to him about America's current role in the world. Seeing how having the Ultimates working with the United States government "policing" the world would produce similar results to their battle against the Liberators, Rogers and his team decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. and to continue to work as an independent team instead.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Millar]] | Artist = Bryan Hitch | Colorist = Laura Martin | Title = Ultimates 2 #13 | Date = May 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Post Liberators===
After the Liberators short occupation Captain America helped in the rebuilding of New York City until he found out that his old Nazi nemesis Arnim Zola did not die; instead the O.S.S. rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war super soldier program. Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the "Marauders" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Falcon]] to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the "Marauders" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the "Marauders" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder's camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola's new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

===[[The Ultimates 3]]===
Before the events of the Liberators' attack, Steve befriended [[T'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates. As the team's deputy leader, Rogers was uncomfortable with the notion of working with a man that he knew so little about. After Steve alarmingly discovered that T'Challa's throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.  Fury lied about the origin of T'Challa's scars, and about T'Challa's history with the Weapon X Program, while also telling him that everything about the "Black Panther" was classified.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jeph Loeb]] | Artist = Marko Djurdjevic | Colorist = Marko Djurdjevic | Title = Ultimate Captain America #1 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

Captain America eventually established a means of communicating with T'Challa and learned of the man's desire to return to Wakanda to see his father. Since no one but Cap had ever seen T'Challa's true face, he decided to take his place in the Ultimates, enabling the real Black Panther the chance to return home.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Following the Ultimates' separation with S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers secretly adopted the identity of the Black Panther.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  Eventually his secret was blown when [[Ultimate juggernaut|Juggernaut]] literally beat Rogers' costume off of him.

However, Cap ordered Hawkeye the coordinates for the Red Skull's position in which he had the jet teleport to the Red Skull and fatally impale his son on the tele-plane's nose.

Swept up in nationalistic pride, he attempted to join the United States Army in order to serve overseas, but due to his original physical stature he is rejected.  He is then inducted into a secret program similar to that of "Project: Rebirth". Due to the formula of the Super Soldier Serum having died with the death of Dr Abraham Erskine, he went through a painful combination of steroids as well as physical and psychological training in order to prepare for his assignment.

But then the psychological pressure began to wear on him and one day after an operation for the Phoenix Program he simply disappeared.<ref name="UCCA2"/>

Rogers, sensing that Carol told him this in order for him to make it look like he went AWOL, subdued Danvers and left to hunt down Frank Simpson. Once in Vietnam, Rogers' search for Simpson results in being told about a secret village deep in the Vietnamese forest.  Unfortunately, the source of this news along with the rest of the village has a synthesis of the Super Soldier Serum via Simpson's blood flowing through them and Steve is captured and taken prisoner.<ref name="UCCA2"/>  Day after day he is physically and psychologically tortured and Simpsons attempts to brainwash him with anti-American diatribes.<ref name="UCCA3">{{Cite comic | Writer = Jason Aaron | Artist = Ron Garney | Colorist = Jason Keith, Matt Milla | Title = Ultimate Comics: Captain America #3 | Date = March 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

One day two SHIELD employees sent to rescue Steve are captured and later executed because they are mistaken for assassins.  Steve upon seeing this begins to pray and Simpson decides to indulge in his beliefs before executing him.  The page then fades to black as Simpson enters to execute Steve, but with a sound of physical pain emanating from the prison cell.<ref name="UCCA3"/>

The sound of pain was the result of Frank screaming after having [[snake venom]] spat directly into his eyes from Steve. After a lengthy hand-to-hand fight with an argument about morality, Steve was able to emerge victorious over Simpson. Aware of the fact that he was surrounded by gun toting villagers with Super Soldier Serum flowing in their veins, he warns them that if they persisted in aiming to kill him, he will treat them as enemy combatants and show them no mercy. After the surrender of the villagers, a rescue by SHIELD, and some time to recuperate, Steve is seen having a beer with Hawkeye where he tells Hawkeye that he did not know if he would make it out of that jungle alive and it was God that sent him the cobra.  Hawkeye intimates that the Devil is another possibility.  Feeling the need to put Frank on the right path and to lead him on the right path, Rogers visits Simpson in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] where he is hospitalized under supervision and begins to read the Bible to him.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Jason Aaron | Artist = Ron Garney | Colorist = Jason Keith | Title = Ultimate Comics: Captain America #4 | Date = April 2011 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>
