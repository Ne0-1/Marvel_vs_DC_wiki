==Fictional character biography==
===Beginnings===
Steve Rogers grew up in Brooklyn during the Great Depression, a scrawny kid protected from neighborhood bullies by his best friend "Bucky" Barnes. Horrified by newsreel footage of the Nazis in Europe, Rogers was inspired to enlist in the  Army around the time the United States entered World War II. However, because of failing the physical test, he was rejected. Refusing to work at the factories, he reattempted enlistment several times. His luck changed during another visit to Recruitment Center when Military Sergeant Dugan recruited him for Project: Rebirth after hearing Rogers pleas. After voluntarily subjecting to surgery, steroid treatments, and other experimental treatments supervised by Doctor Erskine, Rogers became the first genetically-enhanced super-soldier. During the final treatment however, he noticed a suspicious soldier focusing on him instead of standing guard. The shady man revealed himself as a Nazi spy sent to murder Rogers in the event he survive the entire experiment. Nearly sabotaging the entire experiment, Rogers stopped him, but not before the spy murdered Doctor Eskine and a few American soldiers who attempted to stop him. Fully committing himself to the American war efforts, Rogers bid farewell to his sweetheart Gail becoming "Captain America".

For the next three years, he underwent numerous covert operations, often accompanied by Bucky, now a war photographer, and sometimes alongside "Lucky" Jim Howlett (later the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]'s [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]]). During one mission Captain America was able to infiltrate Arnim Zola's facility and kill his first experimental monster, which Zola dubbed "Siegsoldat" ("Victory soldier"). The experiment's dead body then fell on Arnim Zola, seemingly killing him. During one his few leaves he met up with Gail and they spent together which would result in her becoming pregnant. He would later come into battle with [[Herr Kleiser]], who introduced a prototype A-Bomb that was made with alien technology meant to target the White House. However they were too late to stop the bomb from commencing, but Captain America managed to get to the bomb as it is launched. In a successful attempt to stop it in mid air, he fell into the sea and was presumed dead.

===The Ultimates===
Years after, the body of Captain America was found in the Arctic Ocean frozen in a block of ice. It was as if he hadn't aged a day. It has yet to be revealed whether it was due to cryogenic preservation or the super soldier serum that prevented him from aging. Initially he thought [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] was a group of Nazi soldiers who had  captured him, but eventually realized that he was in a different time. He found out his best friend Bucky Barnes was now married to his fiancée and that all his loved ones were dead.

After catching up to his new era, the [[Ultimates]] were faced with the Hulk. Rogers was able to put down the Hulk briefly during combat. When he was about to inject the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] with the antidote, Hulk made a surprise attack and broke the needle and Hulk then began beating Cap, until [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] came to the rescue. After Hulk had reverted back to Banner, Cap knocked him out and had him taken back to the [[Triskelion]].

After learning his teammates [[Henry Pym#Ultimate Marvel|Hank]] and [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Wasp|Janet Pym]]'s quarrels with each other had left Janet hospitalized and nearly dead, Rogers tracked the now fugitive Hank Pym to a bar and engaged him in combat, emerging victorious. He brought Janet flowers and other gifts afterwards, but she was not amused by his actions and rejected his gifts. Rogers soon discovered that his nemesis, Herr Kleiser had survived World War II and was an Alien soldier. This was why he would always seem to survive, Cap saying that he has killed Kleiser "twice". When Kleiser resurfaced, Captain and he resumed their rivalry from 60 years back. During the Chitari invasion, Rogers fought Kleiser in combat, but was unable to defeat him due to his regenerate capabilities. When the Hulk was dropped into their battle, he convinced Hulk that Kleiser was "hitting on [[Betty Ross|Betty]]", causing Hulk to mutilate and then eat Herr Kleiser ending Kleiser once and for all. After the successful battle against the Chitari, Rogers danced with Janet Pym and a relationship between them bloomed (though the relationship became sour as Rogers' 1940s personality created a generation gap between him and the Wasp, causing her to secretly go back to her ex-husband).

===Ultimate War===
During the events of Ultimate War the Ultimates are put in battle with the X-Men after [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]] was found alive and members of The Brotherhood of mutants bombed the Brooklyn Bridge. Captain America tracked down the mutant terrorists and personally took down 3 of the 6 including Hard-Drive and Juggernaut. During an attack on the Triskelion by Magneto, Magneto uses Captain America's shield to hold him back. Captain America than vows that we will kill Magneto. Later the X-Men are framed to make it look like they teamed up with Magneto. During the battle Cap was reunited with "Lucky Jim" Howlett, who is also presently known as Wolverine. During the battle between the Ultimates and the X-men, Captain America calls Wolverine by his given name causing Wolverine to become disoriented, Cap then proceeds to shoot away at Wolverine with a machine gun until Wolverine is knocked unconscious. However due to Ice-mans intervention the X-Men manage to escape.

===Ultimate Six===
During the Ultimate Six story arc Captain America leads the Ultimates in the arrests of [[Ultimate Electro|Electro]] and [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Later those two–along with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Sandman|Sandman]], [[Doctor Octopus]], and the [[Green Goblin]]—escape from S.H.I.E.L.D. He becomes very disheartened when he finds out that these villains were all a result of trying to duplicate the Super Soldier serum. During an attack on the White House lawn Captain America wrestled with [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] with neither out-powering the other. He then explained the truth to Spider-Man that his [[Aunt May|aunt]] was safe with S.H.I.E.L.D. Captain America then fought the Green Goblin landing several hits while not being hit once. The Ultimates and Spider-Man defeat the five villains and they are taken back into custody.

===The Ultimates 2===
Cap and the Ultimates were later under fire from the press and public due to the belief that Thor had revealed that Bruce Banner was indeed the Hulk. In a meeting with Thor, Thor brought up the fact that Captain America killed many people and still goes to church, saying that he's confused with his morals. The Ultimates fought Thor and eventually captured him when his power belt was removed by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. From then on the Ultimates became involved in foreign affairs wherein America attempted to control Third World countries' nuclear resources.

The Ultimates' actions led to Third World countries forming their own superhuman team, dubbed "the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]]". Captain America was framed by [[Ultimate Black Widow|Black Widow]] for the assassination of [[Ultimate Hawkeye|Hawkeye]]'s family and was hastily subdued and arrested when he was visiting Bucky for consoling after his relationship with Janet Pym ended bitterly for Steven. He was imprisoned in the [[Triskelion]]. When the Liberators attacked, he was freed by the Wasp and defeated multiple copies of the [[Schizoid Man]] rather than killing him while escaping the prison.  He and the Wasp soon reached the White House where they met with Hawkeye, Nick Fury, the [[Scarlet Witch]] and Quicksilver. Captain dueled with his Liberators counterpart, The Colonel, and emerged victorious after stabbing the Colonel in the chest with one end of the double-bladed energy sword that the Colonel used.

After the Liberators are defeated, Steven Rogers somberly looked over the Colonel's body being transferred away by S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought of what he said to him about America's current role in the world. Seeing how having the Ultimates working with the United States government "policing" the world would produce similar results to their battle against the Liberators, Rogers and his team decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. and to continued to work as a independent team instead.

===Post Liberators===
After the Liberators short occupation Captain America helped in the rebuilding of New York City until he found out that his old Nazi nemesis Arnim Zola did not die and the O.S.S. rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war super soldier program. Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. Then a white survivalist group called the "Marauders" attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole it, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the Falcon to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the "Marauders" to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the "Marauders" and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder's camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola's new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a support strut onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.

===The Ultimates 3===
Before the events of the Liberators' attack, Steve befriended [[T'Challa]], the Black Panther, and trained him in preparation for making him a member of the Ultimates. As the team's deputy leader, Rogers was uncomfortable with the notion of working with a man that he knew so little about. After Steve alarmingly discovered that T'Challa's throat was heavily damaged and that these injuries caused his muteness, he pressed Fury for more information.  Fury lied about the origin of T'Challa's scars, and about T'Challa's history with the Weapon X Program, while also telling him that everything about the "Black Panther" was classified.

Captain America eventually established a means of communicating with T'Challa and learned of the man's desire to return to Wakanda to see his father. Since no one but Cap had ever seen T'Challa's true face, he decided to take his place in the Ultimates, enabling the real Black Panther the chance to return home.

Following the Ultimates' separation with S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers secretly adopted the identity of the Black Panther.  Eventually his secret was blown when [[Juggernaut (comics)#Ultimate Juggernaut|Juggernaut]] literally beat Rogers' costume off of him. Iron man and wasp arrived with Cap's shield and uniform. He then led the Ultimates against their robotic doppelgangers.

===Ultimatum===
Captain America drowned when Magneto's Ultimatum Wave hit New York. While in Valhalla, Thor appeared to save the life of his love, Valkyrie, and traded his own life for Valkyrie and Steve Rogers. Cap then lead a team of Ultimates and X-Men against Magneto and vowed to not let Thor's sacrifice be in vain. Together Captain America and the other heroes defeated Magneto and saved the world.

===Post Ultimatum===
Shortly After defeating Magneto, Captain America, Iron Man, and the military are searching for survivors in the ruins of New York City. Captain America finds a maskless Spider-Man in the rubble and digs him out. Later while the X-Men dig graves for the fallen, Sabretooth, Mystique, and Assemble arrive, claiming that they have come to pay their respects. However, Jean Grey blames them for the destruction, and a fight ensues. Captain America arrives, decapitating Assemble and stating that he also came to pay respect to the fallen X-Men.

===The Red Skull and the Avengers===
Months after Ultimatum, Captain America and Hawkeye fought a group of AIM terrorists at the Baxter Building who were stealing the building's valuable and powerful technologies. After defeating a majority of the terrorists, Cap encountered the Red Skull, who easily beat Steven. The Red Skull then shockingly revealed to Steven that he was his own son before throwing him out of a helicopter, which Cap was saved by Hawkeye.

After learning that the Red Skull's words to him were true and whose mother's is Gail Richards, Captain America decided to personally confront his son, in which he abandoned the Ultimates and attacked S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the process. Rogers later infiltrate the Army's computer database and discovered the truth of the Red Skull. Sometime later Captain America was in Paris, France for his own reasons. Rogers created a plot to which he would place Nick Fury's Avengers, who were coming for him to capture him, with tracers, and allow him to later find his son, whom the Avengers were also in pursuit. Cap fought the Avengers, managing to defeat all of them. He was subsequently subdued and captured by the Avengers. However this was all a part of his plan to get to the Red Skull as during the fight Cap managed to place tracers on War Machine, Red Wasp, and Black Widow.

Escaping the French S.H.I.E.L.D. guards, Cap jumped into a tele-plane (a jet which teleports), to where the Avengers were fighting the Red Skull, in Alaska. When he arrived, Red Skull, who was wielding the Cosmic Cube, subdued Rogers' jet. However, Cap ordered Hawkeye the coordinates for the Red Skull's position in which he had the jet teleport to the Red Skull and fatally impale his son on the tele-plane's nose. After the Red Skull was in custody, Rogers emotionally bear witness to Gail Richards to be briefly reunited with her dying son.

Not long after the Red Skull, Captain America went undercover as a Russian mobster and captured Frank Castle, aka The Punisher.

===New Ultimates===
