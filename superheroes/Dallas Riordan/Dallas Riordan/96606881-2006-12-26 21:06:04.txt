'''Dallas Riordan''' is a character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==History==
Dallas Riordan (aka Vantage aka [[Citizen V]] aka [[Crimson Cowl]] aka [[Atlas (comics)|Atlas]]) was a member of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|the Thunderbolts]]. Dallas's family had a long storied history of being police officers. Dallas was once a [[NYPD]] officer and a soldier before she went into politics and became the aide to the New York mayor. When the Thunderbolts appeared on the scene after the disappearances of [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], the mayor wanted to take advantage of the Thunderbolts publicity and chose to appoint Dallas as the liasion between his office and the the new team of "heroes". Dallas was completely unaware her new associates were really super villains in disguise plotting to use their new found publicity to get security clearances with which they could take over the world.

Dallas quickly developed a flirtation with Thunderbolt Atlas and the two were dating when the Thunderbolts were exposed as villains. The Thunderbolts led by Citizen V (by now [[Baron Zemo]] once again) soon made an attempt to take over the world. To save face, the mayor chose to blame Dallas for leading him astray and promptly fired her.

A short time later Dallas was approached by [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Roger Aubrey]] of the [[V Battalion]] and was offered the role of Citizen V (the original Citizen V was a [[Golden Age of comics|Golden Age]] hero murdered by Helmut's father Baron Heinrich Zemo) as their primary field agent. It turns out Dallas's grandfather worked for the original V Battalion (the majority of which were slaughtered by Heinrich). He had served in [[World War II]] but stayed in Europe to help recreate the V Battalion with Roger Aubrey and various others. He left his wife and son Jim Riordan behind. Jim raised Dallas to be tough and encouraged her desire to be a police officer. Jim did not like the V Battalion but he presumably wanted his daughter to be trained in combat so she would be prepared if she ever accepted a role in the V Battalion (as was her right being a descendant of a member).

Furious over the way her life was destroyed by the Thunderbolts, Dallas decided to join the V-Battalion and became [[Citizen V]] after they offered her the job. She became somewhat of a super-hero herself, first fighting Baron Zemo and then went up against the threat of the Crismon Cowl who after knocking Citizen V unconscious framed Dallas for being the leader of the Masters of Evil, which was a set up to throw the Thunderbolts off the trail of the real [[Crimson Cowl]] (Justine Hammer). However, the Thunderbolts didn't believe Dallas on her word and arrested her. Dallas was rescued from prison by the V-Battalion. She soon tried to track down the Crimson Cowl but instead found herself fighting the [[Imperial Forces of America]] (ironically but unknown to her they were funded by Baron Zemo). The V Battalion ordered Dallas to assassinate [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] (who would become her co-worker in the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] several years later) because Gyrich and the CSA had been compromised by the nanite conspiracy spearheaded by Baron Strucker of [[HYDRA]]. Dallas refused and the V Battalion sent their operatives to stop her from informing the tbolts of their plans.

When Dallas returned to the states she tried to get help from the Thunderbolts but a battle broke out between the two groups and Dallas vanished in battle kidnapped again by the Crimson Cowl. Dallas wound up in a prison base on the border of Symkaria and [[Latveria]]. She managed to find a means of escape but chose to confront the Cowl instead. The battle ended with her falling off a bridge and into a river. Dallas washed up in Latveria (the country led by [[Doctor Doom]]) and her back was crushed. Left wheelchair bound Dallas soon began to get visitations from her ex-boyfriend Erik (who had been killed by [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]]). Eventually Dallas was freed from Latveria by the Redeemers at which point she came back to the states (and presumably her criminal record as the Cowl was expunged). 

The Thunderbolts who had previously disbanded, reunited during a battle with [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]. Dallas reasoned that the ionic powered Erik's visitations were similar to [[Wonder Man]]'s visitations of the [[Scarlet Witch]] who he used as an emotional anchor to tie him to the world after he had been killed. Erik didn't have a body to come back to and instead channeled his ionic energy into Dallas. In their ionic state Dallas's body could walk and had various super powers. Atlas rejoined the tbolts to fight Graviton but after the battle Erik and Dallas found themselves and their teammates marooned on Counter Earth. When they returned the ionic energy recreated a powerless Erik Josten and Dallas retained a portion of the ionic energy. Thanks to the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], Erik soon gained pym particle powers (again).

Dallas joined the Thunderbolts as Vantage and chose to remain on the team to watch Zemo who she could not trust. Eventually Helmut was scarred by a deranged [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] trying to save [[Captain America]]. The Thunderbolts briefly disbanded and Erik asked [[Hank Pym]] to strip him of his new powers. Dallas and Erik broke up and Dallas took a job working for homeland security.  

Erik soon rejoined the Thunderbolts despite being powerless. After an encounter with [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Genis]], Erik became enraged and tapped into his ionic powers and somehow in the process this left Dallas paralyzed again. 

Dallas is currently a fulltime member of the CSA, and even helped organize the recent battle between the Thunderbolts and the new Avengers. Dallas and the CSA are apparently working with Zemo to save the world from some nebulous threat. Dallas does not trust Helmut, but has so far given him the benefit of the doubt.

==Family==
* Jim Riordan (father)
* ? Riordan (paternal grandfather)
* ? Riordan (paternal grandmother)


==Notes==

* Dallas is not the granddaughter of John Watkins Sr the original Citizen V nor is she the granddaughter of Watkins lover Paulette Brazee and the red headed soldier she married after Watkins death. Dallas's father Jim Riordan was born to an american couple. Jim's father was a soldier in WWII who stayed in Europe after the war. Jim's father helped recreate the V Battalion in 1951 but he died soon afterwards. Jim's mother was left to raise her son alone. Dallas used the family history of John Watkins the 3rd as her cover story when she explained her origin to Captain America. Captain America immediately saw through the deception. JJ Watkins the son of John Sr and Paulette and father to John Watkins the 3rd is presumably unrelated to the Riordan family. Dallas was offered the mantle of Citizen V because of her grandfather's sacrifice in the early days of the reconstituted V Battalion. The official handbook entry on Dallas Riordan is incorrect in these matters.
