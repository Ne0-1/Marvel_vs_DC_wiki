==Fictional character biography==
===Torpedo Armor===
The Torpedo armor was a creation of the [[Dire Wraiths]], their attempt to counter the cybernetic armor of the [[Rom (Spaceknight)|Spaceknights]]. They employed a human scientist to develop it, combining both Wraith and human technology. It had collapsable turbines mounted around the wrists and ankles, allowing the user to fly and fire powerful blasts of air. Upon discovering that the suit was going to be used for criminal purposes, its inventor stole it but died while escaping, and he gave it to the first person he stumbled onto, a man called Brock Jones, who used it to battle crime as the superhero, the [[Torpedo (comics)|Torpedo]]. 

However, Jones eventually decided to hide himself and his family from the people seeking the armor, and went to live in the town of Clairton, [[West Virginia]], were he encountered [[Rom the Spaceknight]] and learned about the Wraiths. Jones agreed to help Rom protect the town from the Wraiths, and Rom altered the costume so its lenses would allow the user to see a Dire Wraith's true form. 

However, Jones was eventually found and killed by the Wraiths anyway. Some of Jones' effects were passed on to his relative Phillip Jeffries, whose son Michael found the armor and gave it to his friend Michiko to use as a Halloween costume.  When Michiko donned the armor, it began broadcasting on a wavelength that allowed human scientists from the lab that developed the armor to track it, and they attacked Michiko and Mike at a college costume party, where Michiko discovered the suit's abilities and fought off her attackers.

===The New Warriors===
Michiko and Mike began sharing the armor, Mike wishing to be a superhero, while Mickey used it to travel the world.  Although she considered heroism as a "ridiculous calling", Mickey did not wish to see innocent people hurt when she could have prevented it. This is one of the reasons which got her mixed up with the New Warriors: After a gang of weapon smugglers under the command of the mercenary Sea Urchin involved an innocent in their dealings, she set out to stop them and ran into the team, who were also tailing the criminals. Mickey helped the Warriors to bring them down.

Mike encountered the Warriors as Turbo when [[Asylum (comics)|Darkling]] put [[Manhattan]] under siege with the energies of the [[Darkforce]] Dimension, and the two Turbos were attacked by Air Force when they trained with [[Nova (comics)|Nova]].  Mickey became a reserve Warrior, helping rescue the team twice alongside other back-up heroes, before being offered a full-time membership by the team.  Mickey continued to share the armor with Mike, but often had to borrow it for missions with the Warriors.

On one mission, the Warriors fought Volx, the queen of the [[Dire Wraiths]], who recognized the Torpedo armor and desired it for the power-boost it would give her.  She tracked the armor to Mike Jeffries and killed him, absorbing his memories.  Posing as Mike, she tricked the Warriors into giving her the armor, which she used in a plot to depower Earth's superhuman population, before she was ultimately killed by [[Night Thrasher]].  Mickey pledged to be the sort of hero Mike wanted to be to honor him.

Mickey later met and fell in love with a young man named Dalton Beck, who unfortunately turned out to be [[Firestrike]], a member of the armored criminal team [[Heavy Mettle]]. When the Warriors clashed with Heavy Mettle, Firestrike turned on his allies and employer to protect Turbo. Beck was then put in the Federal [[Witness Protection Program]], preventing the two of them from continuing their relationship.

===Excelsior (Loners)===
Deciding that she would do more good with her education in journalism than adventuring, Mickey retired the Torpedo armor. With the help of [[Green Goblin|Phil Urich]], she got a job at the [[Los Angeles Times]] newspaper. She later founded the group called [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]], a [[support group]] for retired teenage superheroes; in which will be having their adventures revealed within the upcoming ''[[Excelsior (comics)|LONERS]]'' series.
