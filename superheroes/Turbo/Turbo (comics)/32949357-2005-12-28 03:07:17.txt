'''Turbo''' (real name Michiko "Mickey" Musashi) is a [[fictional character]] and [[comic book]] [[superheroine]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, debuting in ''[[New Warriors]]'' #28

==Character biography==
Originally, the Turbo suit was created by the [[Dire Wraiths]] in their attempts to duplicate the [[Spaceknights]]' armors. They had a human scientist develop it. It had collapsable turbines mounted around the wrists and ankles, allowing the user to fly and fire powerful blasts of air. Upon discovering that the suit was going to be used for criminal purposes, its inventor stole it but died while escaping, and he gave it to the first person he stumbled onto, a man called Brock Jones, who used it to battle crime as the superhero, the [[Torpedo (comics)|Torpedo]]. 

However, Jones eventually decided to hide himself and his family from the people seeking the costume, and went to live in the town of Clairton, [[West Virginia]], were he encountered [[Rom the Spaceknight]] and learned about the Wraiths. Jones agreed to help Rom protect the town from the Wraiths, and Rom altered the costume so its lenses would allow the user to see a Dire Wraith's true form. 

However, Jones was eventually found and killed by the Wraiths anyway. The costume then passed hands to Michael Jeffries, a relative of Jones, who shared it with Michiko. Mickey was the primary adventurer, as the outfit worked better for her than him. Although she considered heroism as a "ridiculous calling", she did not wish to see innocent people hurt when she could have prevented it.

At one point, the costume was stolen by Volx, queen of the Dire Wraiths, as part of her plan to avenge the death of her race. Turbo and the New Warriors stopped her, but Jeffries died in the process.

She later met and fell in love with young man named Dalton Beck, who unfortunately turned out to be Firestrike, a member of the super-powered criminal team [[Heavy Mettle]]. When the Warriors clashed with Heavy Mettle, Firestrike turned on them to protect Turbo. Beck was then put in the Federal [[Witness Protection Program]], preventing the two of them from continuing their relationship.

Deciding that she would do more good with her education then adventuring, she retired the Torpedo armor and returned to investigative journalism. With the help of [[Green Goblin|Phil Urich]], she got a job at the [[Los Angeles Times]] newspaper. She later founded of the group called [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]], whose stated goal is to help fellow teenage superheroes to adjust to mundane lives and dissuade other super-powered teenagers from becoming heroes.
