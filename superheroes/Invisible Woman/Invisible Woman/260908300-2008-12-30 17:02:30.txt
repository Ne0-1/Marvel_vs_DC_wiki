'''Susan Storm Richards''' (also known as '''Invisible Girl''' and later, '''Invisible Woman''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero#superheroines|superheroine]] created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]]. The character first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #1 in November 1961, and was the first female superhero created by Marvel in the [[Silver Age of Comics]]. Like the other founding members of the [[Fantastic Four]], Sue received her powers after being exposed to a cosmic storm. Her primary power deals with light waves, allowing her to render herself and others [[invisibility|invisible]]. However, she can also project powerful fields of invisible energy which she uses for a variety of offensive and defensive effects. Sue plays a central role in the lives of her brother, her husband, her children ([[Franklin Richards]] and [[Valeria Richards|Val Richards]]), and her friend, [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]].

An object of infatuation for [[Doctor Doom]], and, most notably, [[Namor|Namor the Submariner]], Sue's passive invisibility power translated into her frequent deployment as a [[damsel in distress]] during the team's early adventures. However, upon developing the ability to project powerful fields of energy, Sue Storm became a more powerful member of the [[Fantastic Four]], and the team's second-in-command. While Sue operated somewhat in the shadow of her hot-headed brother, [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], and her brilliant husband [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] in the early years, she is now the soul of the Fantastic Four and one of the premiere heroes in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The Invisible Woman is portrayed by [[Jessica Alba]] in the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' and its [[2007 in film|2007]] sequel, ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand|date=September 2008}}
Invisible Woman has primarily appeared in issues of ''Fantastic Four''.  Susan's initial power of [[invisibility]] proved to be of minor consequence in the team's early missions, especially compared to the abilities of the others in the group. Eventually, the creators expanded Sue's abilities, giving her the power to render other objects and people invisible and create strong force fields and psionic blasts.  Despite her enhanced abilities, Susan served primarily as an assistant and [[second-in-command]] to Reed. This changed when [[John Byrne]] began his run on the title. Under his authorship, Sue became more confident and assertive in her abilities which became more versatile and impressive.  For instance, she found she could use her force field abilities to manipulate matter through the air, immobilize enemies, or administer long-range attacks.  Susan changed her ''[[pseudonym#nom de guerre|nom de guerre]]'' to Invisible Woman, and is now recognized as one of the more powerful characters in the Marvel Universe.

==Fictional character biography==

As detailed in ''The Marvel Saga: Official History of The Marvel Universe #16'', Susan Storm, and her younger brother, [[Human Torch|Jonathan]] grew up in the town of Glenville, [[Long Island]], children of a [[physician]] named [[Franklin Storm|Franklin]] and a woman named Mary. The parents left their kids alone one night to travel to a dinner honoring Dr. Storm. On the way, a tire blew out but only Mary was injured. Franklin escaped injury and insisted on operating on his wife. He was unable to save her and she passed away. After his wife's death, Dr. Franklin Storm became a gambler and a drunk, losing his medical practice, which led him to the accidental killing of a [[loan shark]]. Franklin did not defend himself in court, because he still felt guilty over Mary's death. With their father in [[prison]], Susan had to become a mother figure for her younger brother.

While living with her aunt, Susan, at the young age of 12, met her future [[husband]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], a house guest who was attending [[college]]. When she graduated [[high school]] as the award-winning captain of her [[varsity team|Girls' Varsity]] [[swimming|Swim Team]], she moved to [[California]] to attend college, where she pursued an acting career and encountered Richards again. They began to become romantically involved with each other.

Reed Richards, working in the field of [[Aerospace engineering]], was designing a [[spacecraft]] for interstellar travel. Everything was going well until the government stopped the funding of his project. Richards, wanting to see his project through, decided to make an unscheduled test flight. Originally, it was only going to be Reed and his best friend, [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], involved, but Susan was instrumental in persuading Reed in letting her brother and herself join them on the dangerous space mission. In space, the quartet was exposed to massive amounts of [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]]. As a result, they had to abort the mission and return to Earth. After the crash landing, they realized that they gained superhuman powers; hers was the ability to become invisible at will. Realizing the potential use of their abilities, the four of them became the Fantastic Four, for the benefit of mankind.<ref name="Fantastic Four #1">''Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> Susan adopted the code name '''"Invisible Girl"'''.<ref name="Fantastic Four #1"/>

===Invisible Girl===
[[Image:SueFF27.jpg|thumb|left|100px| One of the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'s many attempts to win Sue's affections. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]

As the Fantastic Four, the team found themselves setting up their first headquarters in the [[Baxter Building]] in [[Manhattan]]. The first supervillain they battled was the [[Mole Man]],<ref name="Fantastic Four #2">''Fantastic Four'' #2</ref> followed soon after that by the [[Skrull]]s.<ref name="Fantastic Four #2"/> The Fantastic Four encountered many villains in the early part of their career, but none of them contended for Susan's affections more than [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Sue felt an amount of attraction to Namor, but her heart belonged with Reed.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #4</ref> Soon after that, the Fantastic Four encountered [[Doctor Doom]] for the first time.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #5</ref>

Initially, her powers were limited to making herself invisible.  However, before long Sue discovered she could make other things invisible as well as create force fields of invisible energy. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #22 "Return of the Moleman"</ref> Susan later found herself getting injured in battle with the Mole Man. Her father escaped from prison and operated on her to save her life. Franklin made amends with his children before returning to prison; however, the [[Super-Skrull]] found a way to kidnap Dr. Storm, mimic his appearance, and then fight the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man. In the process of defeating the Super-Skrull, Dr. Storm sacrificed his own life to protect the Fantastic Four from a Skrull [[booby trap]].

[[Image:SueFF106.jpg|200px|thumb| Sue in trouble on the cover of ''Fantastic Four'' #106, art by [[John Romita, Sr.]] and Joe Sinnott]]

Reed and Sue's relationship progressed, with the two of them deciding to get married. The [[wedding]] was the event of the century, with several of [[New York City]]'s preeminent superheroes in attendance. Even several supervillains wanted to attend, even if it was only for the chance to attack the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> Not long after that, Susan and the Fantastic Four encountered [[Galactus]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] for the first time.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #48-50</ref> Sue later became [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with her first child.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5</ref> As a result, she was unable to remain an active member of the team. Johnny's then-girlfriend, the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] elementalist known simply as [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], joined the team, taking over Susan's roster spot.<ref>[http://marvel.com/universe/Invisible_Woman Invisible Woman - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #83 - 100</ref>

Susan's cosmic irradiated blood cells served as an obstacle for her in carrying the unborn child to term. Knowing this, Reed, Johnny,  and Ben journeyed into the [[Negative Zone]] to acquire the Cosmic Control Rod from [[Annihilus]]. Effectively utilizing the device, the baby was safely delivered and was named [[Franklin Richards|Franklin]], in memory of Susan's father.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #6</ref> Due to the genetically altered structure of his parents, Franklin was born a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], possessing vast powers of the highest possible potential. Seeking to use the boy's talents for his own sadistic purposes, Annihilus returned and successfully triggered a premature full release of Franklin's latent abilities, which were already in the process of gradual emergence.  Fearing that his son could very well release enough psionic energy to eliminate all life on Earth, Reed was forced to shut Franklin's mind down, feeling there was no immediate alternative. Angry with Reed for not seeking her input in the matter, Susan left the Fantastic Four and had a [[divorce|marital separation]] from Reed.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #130</ref> Taking her roster spot was [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], of the Inhumans. With the help of Namor, Susan reconciled with Reed and returned to the Fantastic Four accompanied by Franklin.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #149</ref>

===Invisible Woman===
[[Image:Fantasticfour281.png|thumb|150px|left| Sue possessed by '''[[Malice (comics)#Malice (split personality)|Malice]]'''. Art by [[John Byrne]].]]
Susan eventually became pregnant for a second time. However, the trauma brought by her first pregnancy paled in comparison to that of her second for several reasons. This second child was birthed [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] due to Susan having been exposed to [[radiation]] inside the Negative Zone on a previous trip.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #267-268</ref> A depressed Susan was later manipulated by events set into motion by [[Psycho-Man]] into becoming [[Malice (comics)#Malice (split personality)|Malice]]. As Malice, Susan attacked her friends and family in the Fantastic Four, utilizing her abilities at power levels she had never displayed previously. She effortlessly defeated [[She-Hulk]] and Human Torch; luckily, Reed was able to save Susan by forcing her to hate him legitimately.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #280-281</ref> Broken free of Psycho-Man's influence, Susan (off-panel) did something to Psycho-Man, causing him to let out a terrifying scream.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #283</ref> After she rejoined her teammates, Susan stated that Psycho-Man would never hurt anyone ever again. Susan found herself profoundly affected by the entire episode, and decided to change her code name from "Invisible Girl" to '''"Invisible Woman"'''.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #284</ref> Along with Reed, she briefly left the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #304-307</ref> Finding a life outside the Fantastic Four, Reed and Sue were invited into the membership of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #300</ref> The two of them were Avengers briefly, and rejoined the Fantastic Four before long.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #326</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity War]]'', Susan was forced to face off against Malice, who had reemerged in Sue's subconscious. After defeating Malice, Susan absorbed Malice into her own consciousness. Subsequently, Susan's personality was influenced by Malice, causing her to become more aggressive in battle, even creating invisible razor-like force fields she used to slice enemies. She also took to wearing a more revealing costume, which included a cut-out "4" in the chest, showing her cleavage. Her son Franklin, who had traveled forth and back in time, had become the adult hero [[Franklin Richards#Psi-Lord|Psi-Lord]], and he was able to free his mother and absorb the influence of Malice into himself. He eventually defeated Malice by projecting her into the mind of the [[Alternate versions of Mister Fantastic#Dark Raider|Dark Raider]], an insane alternate universe counterpart of Reed Richards who later died in the Negative Zone.
{{-}}

After the apparent death of Reed, Susan found herself becoming a capable leader. Around this time, Susan, who felt Reed was still alive, kept searching for him, even with romantic advances from her old flame, Namor the Sub-Mariner. The Fantastic Four eventually rescued the time-displaced Reed, who found himself temporarily losing confidence in his leadership skills, since Susan was also a capable leader.

Following their return to their Earth of origin, The Fantastic Four encountered [[Valeria Richards|Valeria von Doom]]. This new Marvel Girl came from an alternate future, where she was the child of Susan and [[Doctor Doom]]. Susan eventually came to accept the young girl as a friend. During a conflict with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], Franklin revealed that he used his abilities to save Susan's original stillborn child and placed it in another alternate future. After the ordeal involving Abraxas, Marvel Girl was restored to a baby again inside Susan's [[Uterus|womb]].

This time around, Susan, yet again, had a difficult birthing. Due to the help of [[Doctor Doom]], Susan was able to give birth to a healthy baby girl, which Doom named Valeria, his price for helping Sue . . . or so she thought. Doom placed a spell on the baby, which made her his [[familiar spirit]], to be used against the Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four wrestled Valeria free from Doom's control, defeated him, and sent him to [[Hell]].

Around this time, Sue underwent martial arts training with [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].

Due to their actions involving the country of [[Latveria]], the Fantastic Four separated temporarily. The remaining members banded together to bring Ben back from [[Heaven]].

===Sue, the Human Torch===
Zius, leader of a group of [[Galactus]] [[refugee]]s, kidnaps Susan. His intent was to use her powers to hide planets from Galactus. Reed finds a way to fool Zius, by switching Susan and Johnny's powers. Susan assists in an adventure where Johnny becomes a herald of Galactus. Wielding a cosmic version of her powers, Johnny is able to see through people to the very cores of their personality.

Both Sue and Johnny gain a newfound respect for each other and how they deal with their powers. Soon, Reed tries to switch the powers back. The entire FF's powers are granted to four random civilians before being restored to their rightful wielders.

This parallels an earlier torture by Doom, where Sue was given an extremely painful version of Johnny's pyrokinetic ability.

===Marriage problems===
Sue's brother Johnny, enjoying a night on the town with a date, is beaten up in front of a nightclub by locals angered because his superhero/celebrity status affords him easy entry into the club while they are forced to wait in line, along with thinking he isn't worth of his status anymore in the aftermath of the Stamford incident.

Although Sue was initially part of the pro-Registration force supporting the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], she defects after the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Clone, created by her husband [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], kills famed superhero [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]]. In the midst of the battle, Sue arrives and creates an invisible force shield around [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers, protecting them from Thor's lightning blasts and allowing them to escape whilst she held him off - developing a nose bleed in the process.

Later that night, Sue leaves the Baxter Building and meets Johnny. She has left a note for the sleeping Reed, informing him that the children are entirely in his care, since she intends to go underground and join Captain America's resistance forces. Her final injunction to her husband is a heartfelt request: "''Please fix this''."

The Storm siblings narrowly escape a team of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents bent on capturing them in ''Civil War'' #5.  The two further elude detection by operating under fake husband and wife identities provided by Nick Fury, becoming members of Captain America's Secret Avengers.

Before storming the Negative Zone prison, Sue visits Namor to plead for assistance. He refuses and indicates she is still attracted to him, an accusation she does not deny.

During the final battle depicted in ''Civil War'' #7, as Susan is about to be shot by [[Taskmaster]], Reed Richards jumps in front of her and takes the brunt of the attack, sustaining a major injury. Outraged, Susan beats Taskmaster into the ground, leaving a large circular indentation in the Earth. Following the end of the war, Susan helps with the clean-up of [[New York City]]. She, along with the other Secret Avengers, has been granted amnesty, and she returns home to Reed. Seeking to repair the damage done to their marriage as a result of the war, Sue and Reed take time off from the Fantastic Four, but ask [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to take their places in the meantime.

===World War Hulk===
In the second issue of ''[[World War Hulk]]'', the Fantastic Four confront the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  Reed has designed a machine that recreates the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]'s aura.  The Hulk, only momentarily calmed, discovers the ruse.  Sue deploys her force fields to defend Reed against the Hulk, who shatters her protective fields with such force that she collapses, leaving Reed vulnerable. Reed suffers a vicious beating at the hands of the Hulk; Sue telephones the Sentry for help.

The Hulk transforms Madison Square Garden into a gladiatorial arena.  Sue and the other defeated heroes are held captive in a lower level.  The heroes are outfitted with the same obedience disks that were used to suppress the Hulk's powers and force him to fight his companions on Sakaar.

===The Death of the Invisible Woman===
Some time after World War Hulk, but before Secret Invasion, the Richards' have hired a new nanny for their kids, Tabitha Deneuve.  At the same time, a mysterious new group, calling themselves the New Defenders, commits robberies, and one of their members, Psionics, starts a relationship with Johnny.  After a bad break-up, Johnny is kidnapped by the Defenders, along with Dr Doom and Galactus, to power a massive machine that is designed to apparently save the people of the future 500 years from now, a plan orchestrated by Tabitha, who is revealed to be Susan Richards from 500 years in the future.<ref name="Fantastic Four #560">''Fantastic Four'' #560</ref> Eventually, the present Fantastic Four are able to save both the present Earth and the future Earth by sending the future inhabitants to the Earth Trust's private duplicate Nu-Earth, but after freeing Dr Doom, the future Sue goes to apologize to him, and is electrocuted by Doom.<ref name="Fantastic Four #560"/>

===Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four===
While Susan is on a lecture tour in Vancouver, B.C., a [[Skrull]] posing as Mister Fantastic ambushes her, applying pressure to her skull with an invisible force field and knocking her out cold.  Then, a Skrull infiltrates the Baxter Building disguised as Susan and opens a portal into the [[Negative Zone]], forcing the top three floors of the building into the Negative Zone, and in turn trapping herself, Johnny, Ben, and the two Richards children there. The Skrull impersonating her is later revealed to be Johnny's ex-wife [[Lyja]],<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> who once infiltrated the Fantastic Four by impersonating Ben Grimm's love interest [[Alicia Masters]].<ref>As revealed in ''Fantastic Four'' #357-358</ref>

The real Susan Richards is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Invisible Woman, as her name suggests, has the power to render herself invisible at will, as a result of the mutagenic effects of exposure to cosmic radiation.  She has the psionic ability to manipulate ambient cosmic energy to mentally bend all wavelengths of light (including infrared and ultraviolet radiation) around her body without causing any visible distortion; she also somehow directs enough undistorted light to her eyes to retain her sight while invisible.  Her body cells produce an unknown form of energy that she can mentally project around other people or objects, rendering them invisible. She can also use this energy to render visible, persons or objects rendered invisible by other means, and energy that is normally invisible.

Although invisibility is her namesake power, she also has the psionic ability to manipulate ambient cosmic energy to produce psionic force in relatively simple forms (rectangular planes, globes, cylinders, cones, domes, etc.). She can mentally generate and project force fields of tremendous strength, which she manipulates for a variety of effects.  The fields are able to repel solid objects, even those of great mass and momentum, and can repel all but the very strongest energy attacks.  She can generate these fields at a distance of several hundred feet.  It has never been specified whether her fields are related to gravity, to electromagnetism, or to some other fundamental force, but [[Nathaniel Richards]] theorized it came from [[Hyperspace]].  It may be the case that her invisibility and her force fields are two aspects of the same power, although the precise manner in which these aspects are related is not clear.
 
Sue can shape her force fields into invisible 'constructs,' usually simple shapes such as barriers, columns, cones, cylinders, darts, discs, domes, platforms, rams, ramps, slides, and spheres. By generating additional force behind her constructs, she can turn them into offensive weapons, ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spears and darts. She can generate force constructs as small as a marble or as large as {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area.  By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field, Sue can cause the object to explode. She can also simulate telekinesis, by projecting her energy into a beam out of her hand that connects to the object or victim, and can manipulate the field to move it around. Her force field generating ability makes the Invisible Woman (arguably) the most powerful member of the Fantastic Four and one of the most powerful Marvel characters, and their deadliest enemy Doctor Doom has commented on many occasions that Sue is the most dangerous of the foursome.

She can also travel atop constructs such as ramps, stairs, slides, columns, and stepping discs, enabling her to simulate a limited approximation of levitation or 'flight.'  She is capable of generating and manipulating multiple force fields simultaneously.  This power is only limited by her concentration; once she stops concentrating on a field, it immediately ceases to exist.

She is also able to make shapes which capture ambient light to use as a lantern.

Formerly, she could not use her invisibility and force field powers simultaneously. She formerly could not render herself and a person or object not in contact with her invisible simultaneously.

Susan is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #6</ref> and having received additional coaching from both the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the [[She-Hulk]]. She possesses leadership qualities, and usually acts as the Fantastic Four leader in [[Mister Fantastic]]'s absence. Sue is also a talented actress.

In the miniseries [[Marvel 1602]], Susan Storm is a member of the Four from the Fantastick, in reference to the ship upon which she and three others gained their powers in the [[Sargasso Sea]]. Unlike in the Marvel Universe, she is weightless and cannot become visible. She is related to the alchemical element of [[Air (classical element)|air]] as stated by [[Neil Gaiman]].

At the start of ''[[Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four]]'', Susan is visibly pregnant with [[Mister Fantastic#1602|Sir Richard Reed]]'s child. He forbids her to join him in his pursuit of [[Alternate versions of Doctor Doom#1602|Otto von Doom]] while in this condition, but she goes anyway. Much to Miss Doris Evans' shock, Sir Richard and Susan are not married.

===Exiles===
Sue has appeared many times in the pages of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. First, she was married to [[Black Bolt]] and helped him defeat that reality's tyrannical dictator [[Alternate versions of Iron Man#Exiles|Iron Man]].<ref>''Exiles'' #21-23</ref>. More recently<ref>''Exiles'' #91-94</ref>, another version of Sue has appeared as Madame Hydra, controller of [[Captain America]], [[Slaymaster]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. She has even developed romantic feelings for Wolverine. This version of Sue has killed billions and plans to move onto other Earths. Along with the Exiles, she is opposed by this reality's [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].

===Marvel Apes===
In the alternate universe of [[Marvel Apes]], the Invisible Girl was the only ape to turn human after gaining her powers.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the alternate universe of the [[Marvel Mangaverse]], the Invisible Girl is Sioux Storm, half-sister of [[Human Torch#Marvel Mangaverse|Jonathan Storm]].  Sioux has near [[psychosis]]-level [[emotional detachment]] and may suffer from [[Borderline personality disorder]]. In order to get her to fight — or show any interest in what is going on — Reed has her suit dump near-[[drug overdose|overdoses]] of battle stimulants and aggressor [[hormone]]s into her bloodstream. She is a member of the Megascale Metatalent Response Team Fantastic Four. The team uses power packs that allow them to manifest at mecha-sized levels.  Sioux projects a {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall "invisible friend" constructed from her invisible force fields. The team fights [[Godzilla]]-sized monsters from various alien xenocultures that attack Earth in order to put an end to experiments that endanger all of reality. In ''Mangaverse'' volume 1 the team destroys a [[mecha]]-like [[Annihilus#Mangaverse|Annihilus]].

In ''New Mangaverse'' Sioux is murdered by ninja assassins dispatched by the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]].

===Marvel Zombies===
The [[Marvel Zombies]] universe's version of [[Mister Fantastic#Marvel Zombies|Reed Richards]] deliberately infected his team, including Sue, with the zombie virus, following madness from the murder of their children at the hands of a zombified [[She-Hulk#Marvel Zombies|She-Hulk]]. The Zombie FF subsequently made contact with their [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Ultimate counterparts]], attempting to escape into the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. However, Zombie Reed was neutralized when the Ultimate Invisible Girl practically destroyed a chunk of his brain. After a brief period of imprisonment, the zombie FF were returned to their universe.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] universe, Sue and [[Mister Fantastic#MC2|Reed]]  recently returned from space, where Sue had been holding back a rift in reality with her force powers.
Sue was instrumental in battling [[Galactus]] during the ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'' miniseries in which she deployed psionic force fields to prevent a tsunami from leveling New York.

===[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]===
In this darker reality, little is known about Susan, except that she has had an affair with that reality's [[Havok (comics)|Havok]].{{issue}}  She is shown dead along with several other super heroes who attempted to stop the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #32, the final issue of the series</ref>

===Planetary===
In the [[Wildstorm]] series ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', written by [[Warren Ellis]], the main adversaries of the eponymous team of superpowered investigators are an evil version of Marvel's Fantastic Four called [[Four (comics)|The Four]]. The Sue Storm analogue is Kim Suskind, who has exactly the same powers as the original, except that she has to wear a pair of goggles in order to see while invisible. The daughter of a Nazi scientist and lover of The Four's leader, Randall Dowling, Suskind destroys her opponents by rapidly expanding a force field inside their heads, triggering a fatal explosion.

===Ultimate Marvel===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=December 2008}}
The Ultimate version of Susan Storm is similar in appearance and ability to the 616 universe's Sue Storm. She is a young adult - at least 18 - [[biophysics]] prodigy who has grown up in the Baxter Building in the gifted and talented program supervised by her father.  She is romantically involved with Reed Richards. Throughout the series, Sue has been a major player in events such as Ultimate Secret, and Ultimate Power. Sue has shown tremendous skill with her ability. Recently, in Ultimate Salem's Seven, Sue Storm left Reed Richards and began to work over in Oregon looking at a bizarre sentient organism. It has been shown that this organism is responsible for creating the [[Salem's Seven]].{{issue}} She would later venture back to Oregon to destroy the the main creature with Namor, and the rest of her team. She then tells Johnny to destroy the creatures using his firepowers, and Namor tells Sue that Reed escaped. However, Reed was in the midst of the inferno Johnny created and was to be incinerated. However, Sue came in at the last minute and kissed Reed inside of her force field. She would later play a part in the Ultimatum event where she pushes back a tidal wave that flooded New York. Sadly, the strength of the wave and the pressure needed to push it back knocked Sue unconcious and put her into a coma. While in the Baxter Buidling, Sue is becoming invisible, as well as the FF's base of operations. She would later be revived by the Thing and Mole Man and would travel to Atlantis to confront Namor.{{issue}}

While attempting to shield the Silver Surfer with a force field, Sue is stabbed through the chest by a spear created by a cosmic-powered Dr. Doom, and she dies in Reed's arms.  However, Silver Surfer uses his cosmic powers to heal Sue, tarnishing himself in the process. Before leaving to confront [[Galactus]], Silver Surfer tells Reed to treasure every moment with Sue.

Reed and a [[kimono]]-clad Sue are married in ceremony in [[Japan]] at the end of the film, moments before jetting off with Ben and Johnny to save Venice from sinking.
