The '''Invisible Woman''' ('''Susan''' "'''Sue'''" '''Storm-Richards'''), previously known as the '''Invisible Girl''', is a fictional [[superhero]]ine appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is a founding member of the [[Fantastic Four]] and was the first female superhero created by Marvel during the [[Silver Age of Comics]].

Sue Richards received her powers after being exposed to a cosmic storm. Her primary power deals with light waves, allowing her to render herself and others [[invisibility|invisible]]. She can also project powerful fields of invisible psionic energy which she uses for a variety of offensive and defensive effects. Richards plays a central role in the lives of her hot-headed younger brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], her brilliant husband [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], her close friend [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], and her children ([[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards|Valeria]]).

An object of infatuation for [[Doctor Doom]] and, most notably, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], Sue's passive invisibility power translated into her frequent deployment as a [[damsel in distress]] during the team's early adventures. Upon developing the ability to project powerful fields of energy, Sue Storm became a more powerful member of the Fantastic Four, and the team's second-in-command with a growing assertive confidence. While Sue operated somewhat in the shadow of her brother and her husband in the early years, she is now the soul of the Fantastic Four and one of the primary heroes in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The Invisible Woman was portrayed by [[Rebecca Staab]] in the 1994 film ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'',  [[Jessica Alba]] in the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and its [[2007 in film|2007]] sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', and [[Kate Mara]]  in the 2015 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (Nov. 1961).

Stan Lee did not want Sue to have super strength, "to be [[Wonder Woman]] and punch people", so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such as ''[[The Invisible Man (film)|The Invisible Man]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&pg=PA179|title=Stan Lee: Conversations|editor=McLaughlin, Jeff|chapter=Stan Lee Looks Back: The Comics Legend Recalls Life with Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Heroes|page=179|year=2007|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|ISBN=1578069858}}</ref> His original two-page plot summary for the first issue of ''The Fantastic Four'', reprinted in the [[Marvel Masterworks]] edition of the first ten issues, handled Susan's powers similarly to the [[Universal Pictures]]'s [[The Invisible Man (film)|"Invisible" series]], which required her to take off her clothes, but noting concern that that might be "too sexy" for a comic book.<ref>{{cite book|last = Lee|first = Stan|title = Marvel Firsts: The 1960s|chapter= Snopses"(sic) The Fantsiuc Four July '61 Schedule (#)|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 2011|pages = 484â€“485 |isbn = 978-0785158646}}</ref> Sue was initially presented as the sole reason for Ben Grimm, a bad guy, remaining on the group, which was significantly toned down in the published series.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Invisible Woman has primarily appeared in issues of ''Fantastic Four''. Susan's initial power of [[invisibility]] proved to be of minor consequence in the team's early missions, especially compared to the abilities of the others in the group. In issue 22 (January, 1964), the creators expanded Sue's abilities, giving her the power to render other objects and people invisible and create strong force fields and psionic blasts. Despite her enhanced abilities, Susan served primarily as an assistant and [[second-in-command]] to Reed in the early years of the series. This changed when [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] began his run on the title. Under his authorship, Sue became more confident and assertive in her abilities which became more versatile and impressive. For instance, she found she could use her force field abilities to manipulate matter through the air, immobilize enemies, or administer long-range attacks. Susan changed her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' to Invisible Woman, and is now recognized as one of the more powerful characters in the Marvel Universe.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/comics/16898/history_of_the_fantastic_four_part_three History of the Fantastic Four Part Three]</ref><ref>[http://www2.stetson.edu/inkwell/mharrison-paper.pdf The Empowerment of the Invisible Girl]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
As detailed in ''The Marvel Saga: Official History of The Marvel Universe #16'', Susan Storm, and her younger brother, [[Human Torch|Jonathan]] grew up in the town of Glenville, [[Long Island]], children of a [[physician]] named [[Franklin Storm]] and a woman named Mary. The parents left their kids alone one night to travel to a dinner honoring Dr. Storm. On the way, a tire blew out but only Mary was injured. Franklin escaped injury and insisted on operating on his wife. He was unable to save her and she died. After his wife's death, Dr. Franklin Storm became a gambler and a drunk, losing his medical practice, which led him to the accidental killing of a [[loan shark]]. Franklin did not defend himself in court, because he still felt guilty over Mary's death. With their father in [[prison]], Susan had to become a mother figure for her younger brother.

While living with her aunt, Susan, at the young age of 17, met her future [[husband]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], a house guest who was attending [[college]]. When she graduated from [[high school]] as the award-winning captain of her [[varsity team|Girls' Varsity]] [[swimming (sport)|Swim Team]], she moved to [[California]] to attend college, where she pursued an acting career and encountered Richards again. They began to become romantically involved with each other.

Reed Richards, working in the field of [[aerospace engineering]], was designing a [[spacecraft]] for interstellar travel. Everything was going well until the government stopped the funding of his project. Richards, wanting to see his project through, decided to make an unscheduled test flight. Originally, it was only going to be Reed and his best friend, [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], involved, but Susan was instrumental in persuading Reed in letting her brother and herself join them on the dangerous space mission. In space, the quartet was exposed to massive amounts of [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]]. As a result, they had to abort the mission and return to Earth. After the crash landing, they realized that they gained superhuman powers; hers was the ability to become invisible at will. Realizing the potential use of their abilities, the four of them became the Fantastic Four, for the benefit of mankind.<ref name="Fantastic Four #1">''Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> Susan adopted the code name '''Invisible Girl'''.<ref name="Fantastic Four #1"/>

===Invisible Girl===

As the Fantastic Four, the team set up their first headquarters in the [[Baxter Building]] in [[Manhattan]]. The Fantastic Four encounter many villains in the early part of their career, but none of them contend for Susan's affections more than [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Sue feels an amount of attraction to Namor, but her heart belongs with Reed,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #4</ref> a situation that has been called the Marvel Universe's first [[love triangle]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lantz|first=James Heath |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain?|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91|page=61 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Initially, her powers are limited to making herself invisible. However, before long Sue discovers she can make other things invisible as well as create force fields of invisible energy.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #22 "Return of the Moleman"</ref> After Susan is injured in battle with the Mole Man, her father escapes from prison and operates on her to save her life. Franklin makes amends with his children before returning to prison; however, the [[Super-Skrull]] finds a way to kidnap Dr. Storm, mimic his appearance, and then fight the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man. In the process of defeating the Super-Skrull, Dr. Storm sacrifices his own life to protect the Fantastic Four from a Skrull [[booby trap]].

Reed and Sue's relationship progresses, with the two of them deciding to get married. The [[wedding]] is the event of the century, with several of [[New York City]]'s preeminent superheroes in attendance.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> Not long after that, Sue and the Fantastic Four encounter [[Galactus]] and the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #48-50</ref> Sue later becomes [[pregnant]] with her first child.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5</ref> As a result, she takes time off as an active member of the team.

Susan's cosmic ray irradiated blood cells serve as an obstacle for her in carrying the unborn child to term. Knowing this, Reed, Johnny, and Ben journey into the [[Negative Zone]] to acquire the Cosmic Control Rod from [[Annihilus]]. Effectively utilizing the device, the baby is safely delivered and is named [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin]], in memory of Susan and Johnny's father.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #6</ref> Due to the genetically altered structure of his parents, Franklin is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], possessing vast powers. Seeking to use the boy's talents for his own sadistic purposes, Annihilus triggers a premature full release of Franklin's latent abilities, which were already in the process of gradual emergence. Fearing that his son could release enough psionic energy to eliminate all life on Earth, Reed shuts down Franklin's mind. Angry with Reed for not seeking her input in the matter, Susan leaves the Fantastic Four and has a [[marital separation]] from Reed.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #130</ref> [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] of the Inhumans takes her roster spot. With the help of Namor, Susan reconciles with Reed and returns to the Fantastic Four accompanied by Franklin.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #149</ref>

===Invisible Woman===
[[File:Fantasticfour281.png|thumb|150px|left| Sue possessed by '''[[Malice (comics)#Malice|Malice]]'''. Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]]
Susan eventually becomes pregnant for a second time. However, this second child is [[stillborn]] due to Susan having been exposed to [[radiation]] inside the Negative Zone.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #267-268</ref> A depressed Susan is manipulated by [[Psycho-Man]] into becoming [[Malice (comics)#Malice|Malice]]. As Malice, Susan attacks her friends and family in the Fantastic Four, utilizing her abilities at power levels she had never displayed previously. Reed saves Susan by forcing her to hate him legitimately.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #280-281</ref> Susan (off-panel) does something to Psycho-Man, causing him to let out a terrifying scream.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #283</ref> After she rejoins her teammates, Susan states that Psycho-Man will never hurt anyone ever again. Susan is profoundly affected by the entire episode, and changes her code name from "Invisible Girl" to '''"Invisible Woman"'''.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #284</ref> Along with Reed, she briefly leaves the Fantastic Four<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #304-307</ref> and joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #300</ref> The two of them rejoin the Fantastic Four before long.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #326</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity War]]'', Susan faces off against Malice, who has reemerged in her subconscious. Susan absorbs Malice into her own consciousness. Subsequently, Susan's personality is influenced by Malice, causing her to become more aggressive in battle, even creating invisible razor-like force fields she uses to slice enemies. Her son Franklin, who has traveled forward and back in time, becomes the adult hero [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)#Psi-Lord|Psi-Lord]], frees his mother, and absorbs the influence of Malice into himself. He eventually defeats Malice by projecting her into the mind of the [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#Dark Raider|Dark Raider]], an insane alternate universe counterpart of Reed Richards who later dies in the Negative Zone.
{{clear}}

After the apparent death of Reed, Susan becomes a capable leader. Susan keeps searching for Reed, feeling he is still alive, despite romantic advances from her old flame, Namor the Sub-Mariner. The Fantastic Four eventually rescue the time-displaced Reed, who finds himself temporarily losing confidence in his leadership skills, since Susan is also a capable leader.

Following their return to their Earth of origin, the Fantastic Four encounter [[Valeria von Doom]]. This new Marvel Girl came from an alternate future, where she was the child of Susan and [[Doctor Doom]]. Susan eventually comes to accept the young girl as a friend. During a conflict with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], Franklin reveals that he used his abilities to save Susan's original stillborn child and place it in another alternate future. After the ordeal involving Abraxas, Marvel Girl is restored to a baby again inside Susan's [[womb]]. Susan again has a difficult birthing. Due to the help of Doctor Doom, Susan gives birth to a healthy baby girl, which Doom names Valeria, his price for helping Sue. Doom places a spell on the baby, which makes her his [[familiar spirit]], to be used against the Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four wrestle Valeria free from Doom's control and defeat him.

===Sue, the Human Torch===
Zius, leader of a group of [[Galactus]] [[refugee]]s, kidnaps Susan. His intent was to use her powers to hide planets from Galactus. Reed finds a way to fool Zius, by switching Susan and Johnny's powers. Susan assists in an adventure where Johnny becomes a herald of Galactus. Wielding a cosmic version of her powers, Johnny is able to see through people to the very cores of their personality.

Both Sue and Johnny gain a newfound respect for each other and how they deal with their powers. Soon, Reed tries to switch the powers back. The entire FF's powers are granted to four random civilians before being restored to their rightful wielders.

This parallels an earlier torture by Doom, where Sue was given an extremely painful version of Johnny's pyrokinetic ability.

===Anti-Registration Movement===
Sue's brother Johnny, enjoying a night on the town with a date, is beaten up in front of a nightclub by locals angered because his superhero/celebrity status affords him easy entry into the club while they are forced to wait in line, along with thinking he isn't worthy of his status anymore in the aftermath of the Stamford incident.

Although Sue was initially part of the Pro-Registration force supporting the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], she defects after the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Clone, created by her husband [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], kills famed superhero [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]]. In the midst of the battle, Sue arrives and creates an invisible force shield around [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers, protecting them from Thor's lightning blasts and allowing them to escape whilst she held him off - developing a nose bleed in the process.

Later that night, Sue leaves the Baxter Building and meets Johnny. She has left a note for the sleeping Reed, informing him that the children are entirely in his care, since she intends to go underground and join Captain America's resistance forces. Her final injunction to her husband is a heartfelt request: "''Please fix this''."

The Storm siblings narrowly escape a team of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents bent on capturing them in ''Civil War'' #5. The two further elude detection by operating under fake husband and wife identities provided by Nick Fury, becoming members of Captain America's Secret Avengers.

Before storming the Negative Zone prison, Sue visits Namor to plead for assistance. He refuses and indicates she is still attracted to him, an accusation she does not deny.

During the final battle depicted in ''Civil War'' #7, as Susan is about to be shot by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], Reed Richards jumps in front of her and takes the brunt of the attack, sustaining a major injury. Outraged, Susan beats Taskmaster into the ground, leaving a large circular indentation in the Earth. Following the end of the war, Susan helps with the clean-up of [[New York City]]. She, along with the other Secret Avengers, has been granted amnesty, and she returns home to Reed. Seeking to repair the damage done to their marriage as a result of the war, Sue and Reed take time off from the Fantastic Four, but ask [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to take their places in the meantime.

===World War Hulk===
In the second issue of ''[[World War Hulk]]'', the Fantastic Four confront the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Reed has designed a machine that recreates the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]'s aura. The Hulk, only momentarily calmed, discovers the ruse. Sue deploys her force fields to defend Reed against the Hulk, who shatters her protective fields with such force that she collapses, leaving Reed vulnerable. Reed suffers a vicious beating at the hands of the Hulk; Sue telephones the Sentry for help.<ref>{{cite comic|title=World War Hulk |issue=2 |date=September 2007}}</ref>

The Hulk transforms Madison Square Garden into a gladiatorial arena. Sue and the other defeated heroes are held captive in a lower level. The heroes are outfitted with the same obedience disks that were used to suppress the Hulk's powers and force him to fight his companions on Sakaar.<ref>{{cite comic|title=World War Hulk |issue=4-5 |date=Novemberâ€“December 2007}}</ref>

===The Death of the Invisible Woman===
Some time after World War Hulk, but before Secret Invasion, the Richards family has hired a new nanny for their kids, Tabitha Deneuve. At the same time, a mysterious new group, calling themselves the New Defenders, commits robberies, and one of their members, Psionics, starts a relationship with Johnny. After a bad break-up, Johnny is kidnapped by the Defenders, along with Doctor Doom and Galactus, to power a massive machine that is designed to apparently save the people of the future 500 years from now, a plan orchestrated by Tabitha, who is revealed to be Susan Richards from 500 years in the future.<ref name="Fantastic Four #560">''Fantastic Four'' #560</ref> Eventually, the present Fantastic Four are able to save both the present Earth and the future Earth by sending the future inhabitants to the Earth Trust's private duplicate Nu-Earth, but after freeing Doctor Doom, the future Sue goes to apologize to him and is electrocuted by Doom.<ref name="Fantastic Four #560"/>

===Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four===
While Susan is on a lecture tour in Vancouver, British Columbia, a [[Skrull]] posing as Mister Fantastic ambushes her, applying pressure to her skull with an invisible force field and knocking her unconscious. Then, a Skrull infiltrates the Baxter Building disguised as Susan and opens a portal into the [[Negative Zone]], forcing the top three floors of the building into the Negative Zone, and in turn trapping herself, Johnny, Ben, and the two Richards children there. The Skrull impersonating her is later revealed to be Johnny's ex-wife [[Lyja]],<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> who once infiltrated the Fantastic Four by impersonating Ben Grimm's love interest [[Alicia Masters]].<ref>As revealed in ''Fantastic Four'' #357â€“358</ref>

The real Susan Richards is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref>

===Future Foundation===
Reed started the Future Foundation for the benefit of the world and for science.<ref name="Fantastic Four #579">''Fantastic Four'' #579</ref> When the Human Torch died, the Fantastic Four was dissolved and Sue's heroic exploits were moved entirely under the banner of the Future Foundation.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

It was later revealed that Johnny was revived and is still alive.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #600</ref>

===Secret Wars===
Sue and the rest of the Fantastic Four create a life raft that will save them from the coming death of the universe. However, right before the final incursion between their universe and the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], Sue's part of the ship becomes separated. Reed and Black Panther plan to get her ship back, with Sue holding her part together with her forcefield. However, the death of the universe proves too much, even for her, and she, Ben, and her children die at the hands of oblivion,  with Reed screaming in agony at the death of his wife and children. [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] tells him they need to go, and they leave Sue's destroyed part of the ship behind.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>

When Molecule Man transferred his power to Reed, Reed used it to resurrect his family including Sue, and they began to rebuild the entire Multiverse.<ref>''Avengers Vol. 5 #37''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the Invisible Woman, Susan can render herself wholly or partially invisible at will. She can also render other people or objects invisible, affecting up to forty thousand cubic feet of volume. She achieves these feats by mentally bending all wavelengths of light in the vicinity around herself or the target in question, and she does this without causing any visible distortion effects; she also directs enough undistorted light to her eyes to retain her full range of vision while invisible. She can also use her powers to turn objects of similar size that are invisible by other means visible. Sue can also mentally generate a psionic field of invisible force apparently drawn from hyperspace, which she manipulates for a variety of effects. Most commonly, Sue generates near-indestructible invisible force fields around herself or other targets. She can vary the texture and tensile strength of her field to some extent, rendering it highly rigid or as soft and yielding as foam; softer variations on the field enable her to cushion impacts more gently, and are less likely to result in a psionic backlash against Sue herself (in rare cases, sufficiently powerful attacks on her psionic fields can cause her mental or physical pain). She is also able to make her shields opaque or translucent like [[Milk glass]] to effectively block variations of light such as [[Laser|laser-beams]], or make them semipermeable to filter oxygen from water though the latter is mentally taxing.

Sue can shape her psionic force fields into invisible constructs, usually simple shapes such as barriers, columns, cones, cylinders, darts, discs, domes, platforms, rams, ramps, slides and spheres. By generating additional force behind her psionic constructs, Sue can turn them into offensive weapons, ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spheres and darts. She can generate solid force constructs as small as a marble or as large as {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area. By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field, Sue can cause her target to explode. She can also travel atop animated constructs such as ramps, stairs, slides, columns and stepping discs, enabling her to fly. She can manipulate the energy of her force fields around other objects to simulate telekinetic abilities. It has been said on numerous occasions, including by the Fantastic Four's greatest opponent, Doctor Doom, that Sue is the single-most powerful member of the quartet and she is one of the few beings able to rupture the shell of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #400</ref> She is capable of generating and manipulating multiple force fields simultaneously. This power is only limited by her concentration; once she stops concentrating on a field, it simply ceases to exist.

Susan is also a competent hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having been trained by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #6</ref> and having received additional coaching from both the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[She-Hulk]]. Her unparalleled sense of compassion makes her a natural-born leader, and she usually acts as the Fantastic Four's second-in-command, usually taking over complete leadership of the team during [[Mister Fantastic]]'s absence.

===Film===
* Sue Storm is portrayed by [[Rebecca Staab]] in the 1994 film adaptation ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]''. This film portrays Sue very much as she was in the original comics; shy, reserved and infatuated with Reed. The film concludes with Reed and Sue's marriage.

[[File:Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba).jpg|upright|thumb|right|Jessica Alba as Invisible Woman in ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2005).]]
* Sue Storm is portrayed by [[Jessica Alba]] in the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''. Sue, a brilliant scientist, leads Victor Von Doom's Department of [[Genetics|Genetic]] Research. She is dating Von Doom at the beginning of the film. Immediately prior to the arrival of the cosmic storm which grants her the ability to manipulate light (allowing her to disappear and generate semi-visible force fields), Victor proposes to her: she turns him down. Unlike in other media, Sue was not able to render her normal clothes invisible which resulted in an embarrassing moment when Sue tried to disrobe to sneak through a crowd, only to reappear while still in her underwear. Although her powers are influenced by her emotions, she manages to control her abilities during the team's climactic battle with Von Doom. Sue accepts Richards' proposal of marriage at the end of the film.
* In ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', Sue Storm's wedding to [[Mister Fantastic]] is interrupted by the arrival of the [[Silver Surfer]]. When her powers are temporarily switched with Johnny's, Sue burns all of her clothes off and, upon switching powers back, is left laying completely naked on the sidewalk outside her building, photographed by the crowd, muttering "Why does this always happen to me?". Sue reminds the Silver Surfer of the [[Shalla-Bal|woman]] he loved back on his homeworld. This association, and the friendship with Sue which follows, leads the Surfer to turn against his master, [[Galactus]]. While attempting to shield the Silver Surfer with a force field, Sue is stabbed through the chest by a spear created by a cosmic-powered Doctor Doom, and she dies in Reed's arms. However, Silver Surfer uses his cosmic powers to heal Sue, tarnishing himself in the process. Before leaving to confront Galactus, Silver Surfer tells Reed to treasure every moment with Sue.
