{{dablink|This article is about the comic book character. For the 1940 film, see ''[[The Invisible Woman]]''.}}
The '''Invisible Woman''' (real name '''Susan Richards''', née '''Susan Storm''') formerly the '''Invisible Girl''' (alias changed in ''Fantastic Four'' #284), is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[Superhero|superhero]], who is a member of The [[Fantastic Four]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], in ''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #1 (1961). 

==Publication history==
Invisible Woman has primarily appeared in issues of ''Fantastic Four'' since the very beginning. Unfortunately, Susan powers of [[invisibility]] alone proved to be of relatively little use in team's earlier missions, especially compared to the more aggressive ones of the rest of the group.  Eventually, creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby realized this and gave Susan other powers, such as the ability to project invisible [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] [[Force field (science fiction)|force fields]] and the ability to make other people and objects become invisible.

Despite her abilities, Susan served primarily as an assistant and [[second-in-command]] to Reed, and the comics tended to treat her in a condescending stereotypical manner. This changed when [[John Byrne]] began his celebrated run on the title. Under his authorship, Susan became much more confident and assertive in her own abilities which themselves became more versatile and impressive. For instance, she found she could use her force fields to carry herself into the air, immobilize enemies, or use them as an offensive ranged attack. This revision, also marked by Susan changing her ''nom de guerre'' to the Invisible Woman, has become the standard with Susan being recognized as the most powerful member of the team and has served stints as the team's leader on occasion.

==Character history==
===Origin===
This native of [[Long Island]] is a daughter of a [[Physician|physician]], along with her younger brother, [[Human Torch|Jonathan]]. Their mother, Mary, died because of a car crash. Even with his medical expertise, their father was unable to save her life. Life began to spiral downward for her father. After his wife's death, Dr. Storm became a gambler and a drunk, which led him to accidentally killing a [[Loan shark|loan shark]]. With their father in [[Prison|prison]], Susan had to become a mother figure, for her younger brother. 

While living with her aunt, Susan, at the young age of 12, met her future [[Marriage|husband]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], a house guest who was attending [[College|college]]. When she graduated [[High school|high school]], she moved to [[California]] to attend college, where she persued an acting career and encountered Richards again. The two of them began to become romantically involved, with each other.

Reed Richards, working in the field of [[Aerospace engineering]], was designing a [[Spacecraft|spacecraft]] for interstellar travel. Everything was going well until the government stopped funding of his project. Richards, wanting to see his project through, decided to make an unscheduled test flight. Originally it was only going to be Reed and his best friend, [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], involved, but Susan was instrumental in persuading Reed in letting her brother and herself join them on the dangerous space mission. In space, the quartet was exposed to massive amounts of [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]]. As a result, they had to abort the mission and return to Earth. After the crash landing, they relized that they gained superhuman powers. Hers was the ability to become invisible at will. Realizing the potential use of their abilities, the four of them became the Fantastic Four, for the benefit of mankind.

===Early career as a super hero===
As the Fantastic Four, the team found themselves setting up their first headquarters in the [[Baxter Building]] in [[Manhattan]]. The Fantastic Four encountered many villians in the early part of their career, but none of them contended for Susan affections more than [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Sue felt an amount of attraction to Namor, but her heart belonged with Reed's. Susan later found herself getting injured in battle with the [[Mole Man]]. Her father, who had escaped from prison, came to operate on her and saved her life and was able to make amends with his children before returning to prison. The [[Super-Skrull]] found a way to kidnap Dr. Storm and mimic his appearance and fought the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man. In the process of defeating the Super-Skrull, Dr. Storm sacrificed his own life to protect the Fantastic Four from a Skrull [[Booby trap|booby trap]].

===New life as a wife and a mother===
Reed and Sue's relationship progressed more, with the two of them deciding to get married. The [[Wedding|wedding]] was the event of the century, with several of [[New York City]]'s preeminent superheroes  in attendance. Even several super-villians wanted to attend, even if it was only for the chance to attack the Fantastic Four. Sue later became pregnant with her first child. Because of this, she wasn't able to remain an active member of the team. Johnny's then girlfriend, the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], joined the team, taking over Susan's roster spot. 

Susan's powers became a problem for her to allow her to carry her child to term. Knowing this, Reed, Johnny and Ben went into the [[Negative Zone]] to take a Cosmic Control Rod from [[Annihilus]]. The baby was safely delivered and was named [[Franklin Richards|Franklin]], after her father. Due to his parents, Franklin was born a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]], who one day will have powerful abilities. Because of those powerful abilities, Franklin lost control over his powers. Reed was unable to find an immediate solution as to how to control Franklin's powers and was forced to shut his son's mind down. Angry with Reed with not seeking her input in the matter, Susan left the Fantastic Four and had a marital separation from Reed. Taking her roster spot was [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], of the Inhumans. With the help of Namor, Susan reconciled with Reed and returned to the Fantastic Four with Franklin.

===Malice===
Susan eventually became pregnant for a second time. However, if Susan thought that her pregnancy with Franklin had its share of trauma, this one was going to be even worse for several reasons. This second child was birthed [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] due to  Susan having been exposed to [[Radiation|radiation]] inside the Negative Zone on a previous trip. A depressed Susan was later manipulated by events set into motion by the Psycho-Man into becoming Malice. Susan, with this new identity and emotions as Malice, attacked her friends and family in the Fantastic Four. Reed was able to save Susan by forcing her to legitimately hate him. Susan would then turn the tables on Psycho-Man by making him use his own technology upon himself. 

Susan found herself a changed person after these events and because of this changed her codename to the Invisible Woman. Finding a life outside the Fantastic Four, Reed and Sue were invited into the membership of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The two of them were Avengers only for a brief amount of time, only to rejoin the Fantastic Four later on. 

During the [[Infinity War]], Susan was forced to absorb an evil [[Doppelgänger|doppelganger]] of herself. After the absorption, Susan's personality was influenced by the doppelganger, causing her to once again become Malice. Franklin, who had become Psi-Lord, was able to free his mother and aborb the influence of Malice into himself. He was able to eventually destroy her from within his own mind.

===Effective leader===
After the apparent death of Reed, Susan found herself becoming a capable leader. Around this time, Susan, who felt Reed was still alive, kept searching for him and began falling in love with Namor. The Fantastic Four eventually rescued the time-displaced Reed, who found himself temporarly losing confidence in his leadership skills, since Susan was also a capable leader. Not too soon afterwards, the team found themsleves on an alternate Earth created by Franklin following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

===Valeria===
Following their return to to their Earth of origin, The Fantastic Four encounter [[Valeria Richards|Valeria Von Doom]]. This new Marvel Girl came from an alternate future, where she was the child of Susan and [[Doctor Doom]]. Susan eventually became to accept the young girl, as a friend. During a conflict with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], Franklin revealed that he used his abilites to save Susan's original stillborn child and placed it in another alternate future. After the ordeal involving Abraxas, Marvel Girl was restored to a baby again inside Susan's [[Uterus|womb]].

This time around, Susan, yet again, had a difficult birthing. Due to the help of Doctor Doom, Susan was able to give birth to a healthy baby girl, which Doom named Valeria. Doom placed a spell on the baby, which made her his [[Familiar spirit|familiar spirit]], to be used against the Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four wrestle Valeria free from Doom's control, defeated him, and sent him to [[Hell]].

Due to their actions involving the country of [[Latveria]], the Fantastic Four separated temporarily. The remaining members banned together to bring Ben back from [[Heaven]].

===Sue, the Human Torch===
Zius, leader of group of [[Galactus]] [[Refugee|refugees]], kidnapped Susan to be used as a weapon to hide the presence of planets, from the arrival of Galactus. Reed found a way to make Zius believe that her powers were gone, by swapping powers between Susan and Johnny. After gaining respect for what Johnny goes through everyday life with his abilites, Reed reversed the swapping.

===Sue and Captain Universe===
[[Captain Universe]], having hit a dead end with Dr. Gilbert Wiles' reasearch approached Mr. Fantastic to study itself in order to determine the cause of it's power and memory loss. However the study is interuppted when [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)]] of the [[Shi'ar]] Empire comes to take Captain Universe back to his homeworld for evaluation and depowerment. Under the belief that Captain Universe is going critical he will not allow any to stand in his way of capturing it...however when he makes his move Captain Universe takes residence inside Sue's body so that she can protect it from him. A battle ensues between Captain Uni-Sue and Gladiator which eventually causes a massive Tsunami. Briefly empowering Gladiator, Captain Universe brings him to understand that he is not going critical. Gladiator takes Sue and Captain Universe to stop the Tsunami. At the end of the issue Captain Universe and Gladiator depart for The Shi'ar Empire with Captain Universe being a guest, not a prisoner now.

==Powers and abilities==
Susan has the power to use cosmic energy to make herself and turn objects invisible. She also has the capability to wield invisible force fields, which can be used offensively and defensively.

==In other media==

===Animation===
Invisible Woman has been featured in three animated series throughout the years. She has been voiced by [[Jo Ann Pflug]], Ginny Tyler-Hilton, [[Lori Alan]] in the 1994 series.

[[Image:InvisibleWomanFilm.jpeg|thumb|right|Jessica Alba plays Sue Storm in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''.]]
===Film===
Susan is played by actress [[Jessica Alba]] in the [[Fantastic Four (2005 movie)|2005 film version]] of the Fantastic Four. In the film, she is a brilliant young scientist who leads Victor Von Doom's Department of Scientific Research.  She is Reed Richards' ex-girlfriend and dated Von Doom at the beginning of the film. Immediately before the cosmic storm grants her the ability to generate force fields and to become invisible, she is offered a proposal of marriage from Victor, but she later turns him down. Her powers seem to respond to her emotions such as anger, confusion, and frustration, which she manages to control by the end of the film in the final battle against Von Doom. She accepts Richards' proposal of marriage at the end.

Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue is generally considered by fans as the weakest of the Four, although many such criticisms defer at least partial blame to the script for depicting Sue as a somewhat petulant and fundamentally disempowered, almost prefeminist woman who seems to essentially spend the film waiting around for Reed to declare his feelings for her whilst also needling him to do so. UK ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine has described the film's mischaracterisation of Sue as alternating between being a "whiny, pushy bitch and hollow lust object."

==References, parodies, spoofs and homages==
The Invisible Woman has been parodied many times through the years. One notable homage is in '''Miss Invisible''' of the Mega-Hyper Heroes featured in an episode of ''[[Rugrats]]'' (a spoof of both the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]). Lil, a fan of Miss Invisible, has a superhero counterpart called '''Dotted-Line Girl''' who has similar abilities, but ''can'' be seen, as a dotted line. And it is quite obvious that Violet, in the Disney/Pixar movie [[The Incredibles]] is modelled after the Invisible Woman.
