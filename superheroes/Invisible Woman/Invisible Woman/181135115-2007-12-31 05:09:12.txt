'''Susan Storm Richards''' is a fictional superhero in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  Under the code names of '''Invisible Girl''' and later, '''Invisible Woman''', Sue Storm serves as a member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], she made her first appearance in ''Fantastic Four'' #1 in November 1961.

Like the other founding members of the [[Fantastic Four]], Sue received her powers after being exposed to a cosmic storm. Her primary power deals with light waves, allowing her to render herself and others [[invisible]]. However, she can also project powerful fields of invisible energy which she uses for a variety of offensive and defensive effects. 

An object of infatuation to adversaries [[Doctor Doom]], and, most notably, [[Namor|Namor the Submariner]], Sue's passive invisibility power translated into her frequent deployment as a [[damsel in distress]] during the team's early adventures. However, upon developing the ability to project powerful fields of energy, Sue Storm became a more powerful member of the [[Fantastic Four]], and the team's second-in-command.  Although in the early years Sue operated somewhat in the shadow of her hot-headed brother, [[Johnny Storm]], and her brilliant husband [[Reed Richards]], she is now the soul of the Fantastic Four and one of the premiere heroes in the Marvel universe. 

Sue plays a central role in the lives of her brother, her husband, her children; [[Franklin Richards]] and [[Valeria Richards|Val Richards]] and her friend, [[Ben Grimm]].

Sue Storm is portrayed by [[Jessica Alba]] in the [[2005]] film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' and its [[2007]] sequel, ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.

==Publication history==
Invisible Woman has primarily appeared in issues of ''Fantastic Four''.  Susan's initial power of [[invisibility]] proved to be of minor consequence in team's early missions, especially compared to the abilities of the others in the group. Eventually, the creators expanded Sue's abilities, giving her the power to render other objects and people invisible and create strong force fields and psionic blasts.  Despite her enhanced abilities, Susan served primarily as an assistant and [[second-in-command]] to Reed. This changed when [[John Byrne]] began his run on the title. Under his authorship, Sue became more confident and assertive in her abilities which became more versatile and impressive.  (For instance, she found she could use her force-field abilities to manipulate matter through the air, immobilize enemies, or administer long-range attacks.)  Susan changed her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' to Invisible Woman, and is now recognized as one of the more powerful characters in the Marvel Universe.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
As detailed in ''The Marvel Saga: Official History of The Marvel Universe #16'', this native of [[Long Island]] is a daughter of a [[physician]] named Franklin and a woman named Mary, along with her younger brother, [[Human Torch|Jonathan]]. The parents left their kids alone one night to travel to a dinner honoring Dr. Storm. On the way, a tire blew out but only Mary was injured. Franklin escaped injury and insisted on operating on his wife. He was unable to save her and she passed away. After his wife's death, Dr. [[Franklin Storm]] became a gambler and a drunk, losing his medical practice, which led him to the accidental killing of a [[loan shark]]. Franklin did not defend himself in court, because he still felt guilty over Mary's death. With their father in [[prison]], Susan had to become a mother figure for her younger brother. 

While living with her aunt, Susan, at the young age of 12, met her future [[husband]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], a house guest who was attending [[college]]. When she graduated [[high school]] as the award-winning captain of her [[varsity team|Girls' Varsity]] [[swimming|Swim Team]], she moved to [[California]] to attend college, where she pursued an acting career and encountered Richards again. They began to become romantically involved with each other.

Reed Richards, working in the field of [[Aerospace engineering]], was designing a [[spacecraft]] for interstellar travel. Everything was going well until the government stopped funding of his project. Richards, wanting to see his project through, decided to make an unscheduled test flight. Originally, it was only going to be Reed and his best friend, [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], involved, but Susan was instrumental in persuading Reed in letting her brother and herself join them on the dangerous space mission. In space, the quartet was exposed to massive amounts of [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]]. As a result, they had to abort the mission and return to Earth. After the crash landing, they realized that they gained superhuman powers. Hers was the ability to become invisible at will. Realizing the potential use of their abilities, the four of them became the Fantastic Four, for the benefit of mankind.

===Early career as a superhero: Invisible Girl===
[[Image:SueFF27.jpg|thumb|left|100px| One of the [[Sub-Mariner]]'s many attempts to win Sue's affections. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]

As the Fantastic Four, the team found themselves setting up their first headquarters in the [[Baxter Building]] in [[Manhattan]]. The Fantastic Four encountered many villains in the early part of their career, but none of them contended for Susan's affections more than [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Sue felt an amount of attraction to Namor, but her heart belonged with Reed.  Up until issue 22 "Return of the Moleman" her powers were limited to making herself invisible.  However early on in issue 22, Sue discovered she could make other things invisible as well as create forcefields of invisible energy. Susan later found herself getting injured in battle with the [[Mole Man]]. Her father escaped from prison and operated on her to save her life. Franklin made amends with his children before returning to prison; however, the [[Super-Skrull]] found a way to kidnap Dr. Storm, mimic his appearance, and then fight the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man. In the process of defeating the Super-Skrull, Dr. Storm sacrificed his own life to protect the Fantastic Four from a Skrull [[booby trap]].

===Wife and mother===
[[Image:SueFF106.jpg|200px|thumb| Sue in trouble on the cover of ''Fantastic Four'' #106, art by [[John Romita, Sr.]] and Joe Sinnott]]

Reed and Sue's relationship progressed more, with the two of them deciding to get married. The [[wedding]] was the event of the century, with several of [[New York City]]'s preeminent superheroes in attendance. Even several super-villains wanted to attend, even if it was only for the chance to attack the Fantastic Four. Sue later became pregnant with her first child. As a result, she was unable to remain an active member of the team. Johnny's then-girlfriend, the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] elementalist known simply as [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], joined the team, taking over Susan's roster spot.<ref>http://marvel.com/universe/Invisible_Woman</ref><ref>Fantastic Four # 83 - 100</ref>

Susan's cosmic irradiated blood cells served as an obstacle for her in carrying the unborn child to term. Knowing this, Reed, Johnny and Ben journeyed into the [[Negative Zone]] to acquire the Cosmic Control Rod from [[Annihilus]]. Effectively utilising the device, the baby was safely delivered and was named [[Franklin Richards|Franklin]], in memory of Susan's father. Due to the genetically altered structure of his parents, Franklin was born a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], possessing vast powers of the highest possible potential. Seeking to use the boy's talents for his own sadistic purposes, Annihilus returned and successfully triggered a premature full release of Franklin's latent abilities, which were already in the process of gradual emergence.  Fearing that his son could very well release enough psionic energy to eliminate all life on Earth, Reed was forced to shut Franklin's mind down, feeling there was no immediate alternative. Angry with Reed for not seeking her input in the matter, Susan left the Fantastic Four and had a [[divorce|marital separation]] from Reed. Taking her roster spot was [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], of the Inhumans. With the help of Namor, Susan reconciled with Reed and returned to the Fantastic Four accompanied by Franklin.

===Malice and the "final appearance" of Invisible Girl===
[[Image:Fantasticfour281.GIF|thumb|250px|left| Sue possessed by '''[[Malice (comics)|Malice]]'''. Art by [[John Byrne]].]]

Susan eventually became pregnant for a second time. However, if she thought that her pregnancy with Franklin had had its share of trauma, this one was going to be even worse, for several reasons. This second child was birthed [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] due to Susan having been exposed to [[radiation]] inside the Negative Zone on a previous trip. A depressed Susan was later manipulated by events set into motion by [[Psycho-Man]] into becoming [[Malice (comics)|Malice]]. Susan, with this new identity and emotions as Malice, attacked her friends and family in the Fantastic Four. She effortlessly defeated She-Hulk and Human Torch; luckily, Reed was able to save Susan by forcing her to hate him legitimately. Broken free of Psycho-Man's influence, Susan (off-panel) did something to Psycho-Man, causing him to let out a terrifying scream. After she rejoined her teammates, Susan stated that Psycho-Man would never hurt anyone ever again. Susan found herself a changed person after these events and because of this, changed her codename to the Invisible Woman. Finding a life outside the Fantastic Four, Reed and Sue were invited into the membership of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The two of them were Avengers (in Avengers, volume one, issue 300) briefly, and later rejoined the Fantastic Four.

During the ''[[Infinity War]]'', Susan was forced to face off against Malice, who had re-emerged in Sue's subconscious. After defeating Malice, Susan absorbed Malice into her own consciousness. Subsequently, Susan's personality was influenced by Malice, causing her to become more aggressive in battle, even creating invisible razor-like force fields she used to cut enemies. She also took to wearing a more revealing costume, which included a cut out "4" in the chest, showing her cleavage. Her son Franklin, who had traveled forth and back in time, had become the adult hero [[Franklin Richards#Psi-Lord|Psi-Lord]], and he was able to free his mother and absorb the influence of Malice into himself. He eventually destroyed Malice from within his own mind.

===Effective leader===
After the apparent death of Reed, Susan found herself becoming a capable leader. Around this time, Susan, who felt Reed was still alive, kept searching for him. The Fantastic Four eventually rescued the time-displaced Reed, who found himself temporarily losing confidence in his leadership skills, since Susan was also a capable leader. 

===Valeria, daughter of Sue Storm and Dr. Doom===
Following their return to their Earth of origin, The Fantastic Four encountered [[Valeria Richards|Valeria Von Doom]]. This new Marvel Girl came from an alternate future, where she was the child of Susan and [[Doctor Doom]]. Susan eventually came to accept the young girl as a friend. During a conflict with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], Franklin revealed that he used his abilities to save Susan's original stillborn child and placed it in another alternate future. After the ordeal involving Abraxas, Marvel Girl was restored to a baby again inside Susan's [[Uterus|womb]].

This time around, Susan, yet again, had a difficult birthing. Due to the help of [[Doctor Doom]], Susan was able to give birth to a healthy baby girl, which Doom named Valeria, his price for helping Sue, or so she thought. Doom placed a spell on the baby, which made her his [[familiar spirit]], to be used against the Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four wrestled Valeria free from Doom's control, defeated him, and sent him to [[Hell]].

Around this time, Sue underwent martial arts training with [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. 

Due to their actions involving the country of [[Latveria]], the Fantastic Four separated temporarily. The remaining members banded together to bring Ben back from [[Heaven]].

===Sue, the Human Torch===
[[Zius]], leader of a group of [[Galactus]] [[refugee]]s, kidnaps Susan. His intent was to use her powers to hide planets from Galactus. Reed finds a way to fool Zius, by switching Susan and Johnny's powers. Susan assists in an adventure where Johnny becomes a herald of Galactus. Wielding a cosmic version of her powers, Johnny is able to see through people to the very cores of their personality. 

Both Sue and Johnny gain a newfound respect for each other and how they deal with their powers. Soon, Reed tries to switch the powers back. The entire FF's powers are granted to four random civilians before being restored to their rightful wielders. 

This parallels an earlier torture by Doom, where Sue was given an extremely painful version of Johnny's pyrokinetic ability.

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
Sue's brother Johnny, enjoying a night on the town with a date, is beaten up in front of a nightclub by locals angered because his superhero/celebrity status affords him easy entry into the club while they are forced to wait in line. 

Although Sue was initially part of the pro-Registration force supporting the Superhuman Registration Act, she defects after the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Clone, created by her husband [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], kills famed superhero [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]]. In the midst of the battle, Sue arrives and creates an invisible force shield around Captain America's Secret Avengers, protecting them from Thor's lightning blasts and allowing them to escape whilst she held him off - developing a nose bleed in the process.

Later that night, Sue leaves the Baxter Building and meets Johnny. She has left a note for the sleeping Reed, informing him that the children are entirely in his care, since she intends to go underground and join Captain America's resistance forces. Her final injunction to her husband is a heartfelt request: "''Please fix this''."

The Storm siblings narrowly escape a team of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents bent on capturing them in ''Civil War'' #5.  The two further elude detection by operating under fake husband and wife identities provided by Nick Fury, becoming members of Captain America's Secret Avengers.

Before storming the Negative Zone prison, Sue visits Namor to plead for assistance. He refuses and indicates she is still attracted to him, an accusation she does not deny.

During the final battle depicted in ''Civil War'' #7, as Susan is about to be shot by [[Taskmaster]], Reed Richards jumps in front of her and takes the brunt of the attack, sustaining a major injury. Outraged, Susan beats Taskmaster into the ground, leaving a large circular indentation in the earth. Following the end of the war, Susan helps with the clean-up of [[New York City]]. She, along with the other Secret Avengers, has been granted amnesty, and she returns home to Reed. Seeking to repair the damage done to their marriage as a result of the war, Sue and Reed take time off from the Fantastic Four, but ask [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to take their places in the meantime.

===World War Hulk===

In the second issue of ''World War Hulk'', the Fantastic Four confront the Hulk.  Reed has designed a machine that recreates [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|the Sentry]]'s aura.  The Hulk, only momentarily calmed, discovers the ruse.  Sue deploys her force fields to defend Reed against the Hulk, who shatters her protective fields with such force that she collapses, leaving Reed vulnerable. Reed suffers a vicious beating at the hands of the Hulk; Sue telephones the Sentry for help.

The Hulk transforms Madison Square Garden into a gladiatorial arena.  Sue and the other defeated heroes are held captive in a lower level.  The heroes are outfited with the same obedience disks that were used to suppress the Hulk's powers and force him to fight his companions on Sakaar.

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced|date=June 2007}}
 
The Invisible Woman has, as her name suggests, the power to render herself invisible at will.  This invisibility is achieved by bending all wavelengths of light (including infrared and ultraviolet radiation) around her body without causing any visible distortion; she also somehow directs enough undistorted light to her eyes to retain her sight while invisible.  She can project a similar invisibility effect onto other people or objects, rendering them invisible.

Although invisibility is her namesake power, her primary power (at least for combat situations) is the ability to generate force fields of tremendous strength, which she manipulates for a variety of effects.  The fields are able to repel solid objects, even those of great mass and momentum, and can repel all but the very strongest energy attacks.  She can generate these fields at a distance of several hundred feet.  It has never been specified whether her fields are related to gravity, to electromagnetism, or to some other fundamental force.  It may be the case that her invisibility and her force fields are two aspects of the same power, although the precise manner in which these aspects are related is not clear.
 
Sue can shape her force fields into invisible 'constructs,' usually simple shapes such as barriers, columns, cones, cylinders, darts, discs, domes, platforms, rams, ramps, slides and spheres. By generating additional force behind her constructs, she can turn them into offensive weapons, ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spears and darts. She can generate force constructs as small as a marble or as large as 100 feet in diameter, and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area.  By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field, Sue can cause the object to explode. Her force-field generating ability makes The Invisible Woman (arguably) the most powerful member of The Fantastic Four and one of the most powerful marvel characters.

She can also travel atop constructs such as ramps, stairs, slides, columns and stepping discs, enabling her to simulate a limited approximation of levitation or 'flight.'  She is capable of generating and manipulating multiple force fields simultaneously.  This power is only limited by her concentration; once she stops concentrating on a field, it immediately ceases to exist.

==Other versions==
[[Image:Ultinvwmn.jpg|thumb|right|Ultimate Sue Storm on the cover of ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #9.  Art by [[Stuart Immonen]].]]
===1602===
In the miniseries [[Marvel 1602]], Susan Storm is a member of the Four from the Fantastick, in reference to the ship upon which she and three others gained their powers in the [[Sargasso Sea]]. Unlike in the Marvel Universe, she is weightless and cannot become visible. She is related to the alchemical element of [[Air (classical element)|air]] as stated by [[Neil Gaiman]].

At the start of ''[[1602: Fantastick Four]]'', Susan is visibly pregnant with Sir Richard Reed's child. He forbids her to join him in his pursuit of Otto von Doom while in this condition, but she goes anyway. Much to Miss Doris Evans' shock, Sir Richard and Susan have not married.

===Exiles===
Sue has appeared many times in the pages of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. First, she was married to [[Black Bolt]] and helped him defeat that reality's tyrannical dictator [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Exiles'' #21-23</ref>. More recently<ref>''Exiles'' #91-94</ref>, another version of Sue has appeared as Madame Hydra, controller of [[Captain America]], [[Longshot]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. She has even developed romantic feelings for Wolverine. This version of Sue has killed billions and plans to move onto other Earths. Along with the Exiles, she is opposed by this reality's [[Reed Richards]] and [[Elektra]].

===French Marvel Translations===
Sue is named JANE Richards-Storm in French translations of Les Quatre Fantastiques adventures. She's nicknamed "Janet" by [[Ben Grimm]]. 

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the alternate universe of the Marvel Mangaverse, the Invisible Girl is Sioux Storm, half-sister of [[Human Torch|Jonatha Storm]].  Sioux has near [[psychosis]]-level [[emotional detachment]] and may suffer from [[Borderline Personality Disorder]]. In order to get her to fight — or show any interest in what is going on — Reed has her suit dump near-[[overdoses]] of battle stimulants and aggressor [[hormones]] into her bloodstream. She is a member of the Megascale Metatalent Response Team Fantastic Four. The team uses powerpacks that allow them to manifest at mecha-sized levels.  Sioux projects a 200 ft tall "invisible friend" constructed from her invisible force fields. The team fights [[Godzilla]]-sized monsters from various alien xenocultures that attack Earth in order to put an end to experiments that endanger all of reality. In ''Mangaverse'' volume 1 the team destroys a [[mecha]]-like [[Annihilus]].

In ''New Mangaverse'' Sioux is murdered by ninja assassins dispatched by the Hand.

===Marvel Zombies===
The [[Marvel Zombies]] universe's version of Reed Richards deliberately infected his team, including Sue, with the zombie virus, following madness from the murder of their children at the hands of a zombified [[She-Hulk]]. The Zombie FF subsequently made contact with their Ultimate counterparts, attempting to escape into the Ultimate Marvel universe. However, Zombie Reed was neutralized when the Ultimate Invisible Girl practically destroyed a chunk of his brain. After a brief period of imprisonment, the zombie FF were returned to their universe.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] universe, Sue and Reed recently returned from space, where Sue had been holding back a rift in reality. 
Sue was instrumental in battling [[Galactus]] during the ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'' mini-series in which she deployed her force fields to prevent a tsunami from leveling New York.

===Mutant X===
In this darker reality, little is known about Susan, except that she has had an affair with that reality's [[Havok (comics)|Havok]].

===Planetary===
In the Wildstorm series ''[[Planetary]]'', written by [[Warren Ellis]], the main adversaries of the eponymous team of superpowered investigators are an evil version of Marvel's Fantastic Four called [[Four (comics)|The Four]]. The Sue Storm analogue is Kim Suskind, who has exactly the same powers as the original, except that she has to wear a pair of goggles in order to see while invisible. The daughter of a Nazi scientist and lover of The Four's leader, Randall Dowling, Suskind destroys her opponents by rapidly expanding a force field inside their heads, triggering a fatal explosion.

===Ultimate Sue Storm===
The Ultimate version of Susan Storm is similar in appearance and ability to the 616 universe's Sue Storm. She is a young adult - at least 19 - [[biophysics]] prodigy who has grown up in the Baxter Building in the gifted and talented program supervised by her father.  She is romantically involved with Reed Richards.

===Film===
====Unreleased film====
Sue Storm is portrayed by actress [[Rebecca Staab]] in the low-budget [[The Fantastic Four (film)|1994 film version]] of the Fantastic Four. In the movie, Sue and her brother live with their mother, who runs a boarding house where Reed Richards ([[Alex Hyde-White]]) lives during college. Sue is shown to have a crush on Reed as a young girl despite the 10-year age difference between them. When Reed designs his shuttle flight years later, he goes back to the house to invite Sue and Johnny ([[Jay Underwood]]) to join him and Ben Grimm ([[Michael Bailey Smith]]) on the journey. Upon seeing her again, Reed is immediately smitten with the fully grown Susan. During their space flight, exposure to radiation from the cosmic phenomenon known only as "Colossus" causes the team's ship to crash back down to Earth and bestows them with their famous powers. Later in the film, Sue is the one who designs the team's uniforms.  At the movie's end, Reed finally confesses his feelings for her and the two are married. Though officially never released to the public, this film is widely available as a bootleg on both VHS and DVD.

====2005 Film====
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Jessica Alba invisible.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Jessica Alba]] as the Invisible Woman{{puic|Image:Jessica Alba invisible.JPG|log=2007 December 7}}]] -->
Sue is portrayed by [[Jessica Alba]] in the [[Fantastic Four (film)|2005 film]] ''The Fantastic Four.'' Sue, a brilliant scientist, leads Victor Von Doom's Department of [[Genetics|Genetic]] Research. She is dating Von Doom at the beginning of the film. Immediately prior to the arrival of the cosmic storm which grants her the ability to manipulate light (allowing her to disappear and generate semi-visible force fields), Victor proposes to her: she turns him down.  Unlike in other media, Sue was not able to render her normal clothes invisible (her radiated spacesuit can turn visible with her, though), therefore when she first uses her powers, she [[stripped]] off her clothes.  During the strip, her invisibility turned off, leaving her only in a [[bra]] and [[panties]].  This angered her, so she was rendered invisible again.  While invisible, she took off her [[underwear]], walking through the crowd invisible and completely naked then putting back her clothes on after the Thing ran from the police.  Although her powers are influenced by her emotions, she manages to control her abilities during the team's climactic battle with Von Doom. Sue accepts Richards' proposal of marriage at the end of the film.

====''Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer'' (2007 film)====
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image: Sue_2.JPG|right|thumb|250px|[[Jessica Alba]] portraying Sue Storm in ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.]] --> 
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Fantastic-four-2-5.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Sue Storm in Rise of the Silver Surfer.]] -->
In ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]],'' Sue Storm's wedding to [[Mr. Fantastic]] is interrupted by the arrival of the [[Silver Surfer]]. After coming in contact with the Silver Surfer, the [[Human Torch]] was able to switch powers with others through physical contact.  When Sue checks on him, she switches powers with him, igniting her in flames.  When they switch their powers back, her clothes burned off and she lies on the streets [[nude]], once again completely humiliating her with people taking pictures of her; as she turns invisible she laments "Why does this always happen to me?"  Sue reminds the [[Silver Surfer]] of the woman he loved back on his homeworld.  This association, and the friendship with Sue which follows, leads the Surfer to turn against his master, Galactus.  

While attempting to shield the Silver Surfer with a force field, Sue is stabbed through the chest by a spear created by a cosmic-powered Dr. Doom, and she dies in Reed's arms.  However, Silver Surfer uses his cosmic powers to heal Sue, tarnishing himself in the process. Before leaving to confront [[Galactus]], Silver Surfer tells Reed to treasure every moment with Sue.  

Reed and a [[kimono]]-clad Sue are married in ceremony in Japan at the end of the film, moments before jetting off with Ben and Johnny to, again, save the world.

===Video games===
*Sue Storm has appeared in numerous video games, usually accompanied by her brother and fellow teammates, being one of the most important the 1998 [[Fantastic Four (PlayStation game)|videogame]] of her team, which was for the original [[Playstation]]. 

*She appeared as a playable character in the [[Fantastic Four (video game)|video game based on the film]], and was voiced by Jessica Alba. She also appears as a playable character in the game based on the [[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer|sequel to the first film]].

*She also has a cameo appearance in the [[Spider-Man]] game based on his [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|1990s animated series]] for [[Sega Mega Drive]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]]. By reaching certain levels of the game, she can be called a limited number of times for assistance.

* Sue Storm appears as a playable character in the ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' video game, voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]. She can serve a variety of in-game roles as either a booster or buffer, unseen melee attacker, or a mid- to long-range fighter. Her classic, Ultimate, New Marvel, and Original costumes are available. She has special dialogue with [[Jean Grey]], [[Blackbolt]],[[Namor]] and [[Uatu]] . A simulation disc has Invisible Woman fighting [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]].

==Parodies and homages==
Susan Storm was parodied as Miss Invisible of the Mega-Hyper Heroes featured in an episode of ''[[Rugrats]]'' (which provides a spoof of both the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and the Fantastic Four). [[Phil and Lil DeVille|Lil]], a fan of Miss Invisible when she was younger, has a superhero counterpart called Dotted-Line Girl who has similar abilities, but can be seen as a dotted line (this is a reference to early Marvel comics where invisibility was depicted as any hollow figure shaped by a dotted line). 

In the Disney/Pixar movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'', a Fantastic Four-like family motif is used, with the daughter [[Violet (The Incredibles)|Violet]] sharing the powers of Sue Storm (while the mother, Elasti-Girl/Mrs. Incredible, shared the stretching powers of Mr. Fantastic, Mr. Incredible had super-strength like the Thing, and one of Jack Jack's powers is like the Human Torch). 

Sue was parodied in ''[[Spongebob Squarepants]]'' as Miss Appear in the episode "[[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy]] V." 

In the "N-Men" episode of ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', Jimmy, Cindy, Carl, Libby, and Sheen get super powers when passing through a cloud. Libby, after gaining the power to turn invisible and generate force fields, takes the name Invisible Sister.

Susan Storm and the rest of the Fantastic Four are parodied on ''[[The Venture Bros.]],'' as the Impossibles, but save for Dr. Richard Impossible (a parody of Reed Richards) their powers are burdens to them. Sally Impossible's skin becomes transparent, leaving her muscles, tendons, and arteries visible.

At the end of the ''[[Code Lyoko]]'' episode "Vertigo", [[Odd Della Robbia]] mentions Sue Storm when comparing Aelita's invisibility to hers. Like with ''Code Lyoko'', MoonScoop produces the most recent animated Fantastic Four series, and the toy line for the show is also backed by Marvel.
