''Alternate meaning: [[The Invisible Woman]], a [[1940]] film.''
----
'''The Invisible Woman''', real name '''Susan Richards''', nee '''Susan Storm''', formerly the '''Invisible Girl''', is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] who is a member of The [[Fantastic Four]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

As the girlfriend and later wife of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and sister of [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], she was instrumental in persuading pilot [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] in joining them on a dangerous space mission, which got them massively exposed to [[cosmic radiation]].  As a result, she gained the ability to become [[invisibility|invisible]] at will.  Unfortunately, this power alone proved to be of relatively little use in their missions, especially compared to the more aggressive ones of the rest of the group.  Fortunately, creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] realized this and gave Susan the ability to project invisible [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] [[force field]]s and the ability to make other people and objects become invisible.

Despite her abilities, Susan served primarily as an assistant to Reed, and the comics tended to treat her in a condescending matter.  This changed when [[John Byrne]] began his celebrated run on the title.  Under his authorship, Susan became much more confident and assertive in her own abilities which themselves became more versatile and impressive.  For instance, she found she could use her force fields to carry herself into the air, immobilize enemies, or use them as an offensive ranged attack.  Eventually, she came to be recognized as the most powerful member of the team and served stints as the team's leader on occasion.

In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[1602 (comic)|1602]], her power is associated with the [[classical element]] of [[air]].
