'''Dominic Fortune''' is a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] character, owned by [[Marvel Comics]].

Created by [[Howard Chaykin]] and based on the [[Scorpion (Atlas/Seaboard Comics)|Scorpion]], Chaykin's character for the failed [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]] company, Dominic Fortune was originally a 1930s costumed, fortune-seeking adventurer. Several other versions of the character, set in the modern day, have appeared since. 

==Publication history==
Dominic Fortune was created for Marvel's [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Code]]-free black-and-white magazine line. His first two appearances occurred in '[[Marvel Preview]]' #2 (1975, no month) and '[[Marvel Super Action]]' #1 (January 1976), a one-shot magazine. These stories were later reprinted in '[[Marvel Preview]]' #20 (Winter 1980).

He next appeared as 'Dominic Fortune, Brigand For Hire' in the back pages of '[[Hulk (comics)#1970s|Hulk]]' (a full-color magazine, formerly the b/w 'Rampaging Hulk') #21 - #25 (June 1980 - February 1981), written by [[Denny O'Neil]] with fully-painted artwork by Chaykin. Issue #24 (December 1980) contains a short editorial to the effect that although the magazine was reverting to b/w from the following issue, this would be '' 'with the exception of the Dominic Fortune strip which will be in color through its offbeat conclusion in issue #26' ''. However, despite this assertion, and #25 containing an advert for Dominic Fortune in #26, issue #25's story, '' 'Slay Bells' '', was the last published. The finale to the series remains unpublished. During this time, Fortune also appearanced in '[[Marvel Premiere]]' #56 (October 1980), in a story plotted by [[Len Wein]] and laid out by Chaykin for the never-published 'Marvel Super-Action' #2, and finished by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]].

Subsequently, a senior citizen version of the character interacted with modern Marvel heroes in '[[Marvel Team-Up]]' #120 (August 1982), '[[Web of Spider-Man]]' #10 (January 1986), '[[Iron Man]]' (first volume) #212 - #213 (November 1986 - December 1986), and 'Web of Spider-Man' #71 - #72 (December 1990 - January 1991), with no involvement from Chaykin other than him drawing the cover for 'Web of Spider-Man' #10.

The next appearance of a Dominic Fortune character was in 'Sable and Fortune', a 4-issue [[limited series]] published in 2006, written by Brendan Cahill and painted by John Burns (issues #1-3) and Laurence McCubbin (#4). Originally solicited as a 6-issue series, 'Sable and Fortune' was shortened to four issues after issue #1 was released in March 2006. According to the letters page of #3 (May 2006) the four part-tale was unaffected, the last two issues would have been a separate story. He also appeared as a supporting character in '[[Marvel Comics Presents]]' (vol. 2) #5 - 12 (February 2008 - October 2008).

In June, 2009 a 6-part online-only digital comic 'Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune' was published as part of Marvel Comics' digital initiative. Written by [[Dean Motter]] and drawn by [[Greg Scott]], it featured the original Dominic Fortune in tales set during the [[1930s]].<ref>[http://marvel.com/digitalcomics/titles/ASTONISHING_TALES~colon~_DOMINIC_FORTUNE.2009 Link to the issues of Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune on Marvel's Digital Comics Unlimited subscription service]</ref> This was followed in October 2009 by a self-titled 4-part miniseries published under Marvel's mature MAX imprint.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=3162&disp=table</ref> Written and illustrated by [[Howard Chaykin]], this miniseries was also set in the [[1930s]] and featured the original character.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Ekstrom |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/070910-DomFortune.html |title=Return to Fortune: Chaykin on Dominic Fortune MAX |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref>

In November 2009 Marvel Comics announced the release of a 'Dominic Fortune' [[Trade Paperback]] book. The title reprints the 2009 Max series and the digital 'Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune'.
 

==Fictional character biography==

===Duvid "David" Fortunov===

Born in New York, Duvid Jerome Fortunov spent the 1920s until just after the [[Wall Street Crash]] in 1929 on [[New York]] City's [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] '' 'lying, cheating and stealing my way through life' ''.<ref> 'Dominic Fortune' #1, October 2009</ref>
Sometime after ratting out New York gangster Olga Cimaglia,<ref>''referred to in'' 'Marvel Super Action' #1, January 1976</ref> Fortunov relocated to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] where he changed his name to Dominic Fortune and became a costumed adventurer for hire and a mercenary. By 1934 he was involved in the war betwen Bolivia and Paraguay - fighting for both sides before returning to Los Angeles, where he took a job guarding three '' 'out of control and drunken' '' film stars. <ref>'Dominic Fortune #1, October 2009</ref> Trying to unravel a plot to kill him, he travelled to Berlin for the Olympic Games, and eventually foiled a plot by American Fifth Columnists to kill President Roosevelt and his wife and gain important funding from the Germans and Italians to support Nazi sympathisers in the U.S..<ref>'Dominic Fortune #1 - 4, October 2009 - January 2010</ref> Not long afterwards, he fell in with Sabbath Raven, the owner of the ''Mississippi Queen'', a floating [[casino]] moored just outside of US territorial waters, where he enjoyed a romantic relationship with her and they shared many of his adventures. Some time during the mid-1930's he prevented Jacob Einhorn, a property magnate, from selling U.S. secrets to the Japanese in exchange for land after their planned invasion.<ref>'Marvel Preview' #25, 1975</ref>

In 1937, he uncovered a Nazi propaganda plot in the comic book industry.<ref>'Hulk' #21, June 1980</ref>  He also broke up a cult of zombies,<ref>'Hulk' #22, August 1980</ref> thwarted [[Baron Strucker]]'s attempted assassination of a U.S. senator,<ref>'Hulk' #23, October 1980</ref> exposed the phony "child star" Tina Timmons,<ref>'Hulk' #24, December 1980</ref> and rescued the British ambassador from a terrorist.<ref>'Hulk' #25, February 1981</ref> The same year, in another adventure in Europe he encountered [[Dr. Doom]] and later [[Captain America]] villains Baron Von Strucker and [[Baron Zemo]] and spent some time in [[Latveria]] and in [[Wakanda]] in Africa while foiling Nazi weapons intrigues involving the as-yet un-named mineral [[Vibranium]]. Not long afterwards, having been evicted from his office, he began living aboard the ''Mississippi Queen'' at Sabbath's invitation.<ref>Marvel Digital Comic ''Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune'' #1 -6, 2009</ref>

Early in 1940 he foiled a Nazi plot to steal top secret plans from a munitions factory<ref>''flashback in'' 'Web of Spider-Man' #10, January 1986</ref>, then in May of the same year lost contact with Sabbath Raven after an argument in a bar in Rotterdam just before the Nazi invasion of the city.<ref>''flashback in'' 'Web of Spider-Man' #71, December 1990</ref> After failing to find her, Fortune returned to the U.S.,<ref>''flashback in'' 'Web of Spider-Man' #71, December 1990</ref> where later in 1940, he was rejected as a subject for Project: Rebirth, but helped protect the man who was chosen, [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] (who becomes Captain America) from Nazi agents.<ref>'Marvel Super-Heroes' Vol. 2 #3</ref> He then returned to the war in Europe as a G.I. in 1944, and after the war continued his search for Sabbath, but again failed.<ref>''flashback in'' 'Web of Spider-Man' #71, December 1990</ref>

Eventually Fortune returned to America and being Duvid Fortunov. He established himself as a [[Pontiac]] salesman in [[Nassau County, New York]] (becoming 'Nassau County Champion Salesman' in 1965), where he married and had two children. <ref> ''flashback in'' 'Iron Man (series 1)' #212, November 1986</ref> He eventually retired to Restwell Nursing Home, NY after the death of his wife, <ref>'Marvel Team-Up' #120, August 1982</ref> but came out of retirement to battle [[Turner D. Century]] alongside [[Spider-Man]],<ref>'Marvel Team-Up' #120, August 1982</ref> after which he vowed to take back up his search for Sabbath Raven. Some time after this he left the rest home, then alongside Spider-Man battled the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], who is working for [[Iron Monger#Other Iron Mongers|Simon Steele]], an old adversary of Fortune's who he had been investigating in the hope of finding clues to the fate of Sabbath.<ref> 'Web of Spider-Man' #10, January 1986</ref> 

He later aided [[Iron Man]] in his battle with the [[Iron Monger]],<ref>'Iron Man' #212-213, November/December 1986</ref> once again an employee of Simon Steele. Fortune's son Jerry witnessed the battle and, believing his father killed, swore vengeance. Donning his father's costume, Jerry Fortunov became the new Dominic Fortune,<ref>'Iron Man' #212, November 1986</ref> though after finding his father still alive he was killed by Steele when he takes a shot aimed at his father.<ref>'Iron Man' #213, December 1986</ref> Iron Man then tells Fortune that the Sabbath he had seen with Steele while in captivity was in fact Sabbath Raven's daughter by Steele's brother. 

Seeking vengeance for his son's murder, with the help of Spider-Man, Dominic Fortune tracked Steele and the younger Sabbath Raven to New York,<ref>'Web of Spider-Man' #71, December 1990</ref> only to discover that Steele had married Fortune's Sabbath many years before. Eventually Fortune, Spider-Man and [[Silver Sable]] corner Steele hiding aboard the ageing remains of the ''Mississippi Queen'' and Fortune was reunited with the original Sabbath Raven.<ref> 'Web of Spider-Man #72, January 1991'</ref>

===Jerry Fortunov===
When Jerry Fortunov thought that his father had been killed<ref>'Iron Man' #212, November 1986</ref>, he swore vengeance on the Iron Monger. Donning his father's costume, Jerry Fortunov became the new Dominic Fortune. Jerry Fortunov's career as Dominic Fortune was short. Discovering that his father was alive Jerry, with help from Iron Man, attacked the estate of Simon Steele. He was fatally injured in the battle, shot by Simon Steele, and died in his father's arms.<ref>'Iron Man' #213, December 1986</ref>

=== 2006 version ===

In 2006 a new version of Dominic Fortune joins forces with [[Silver Sable]] to stop the plans of traitors from within Silver Sable's own Wild Pack.<ref>'Sable and Fortune' #1 - 4, March 2006 - June 2006</ref> This incarnation of Fortune is a P.I.. His relationship to the previous Dominic Fortune is unclear - in the editorial in issue #1, editor [[John Barber (comics)|John Barber]] states '' 'Where Dominic has been ... and what relationship, if any, the man in this magazine has to him - remains to be revealed. I know their relationship, but my lips are sealed' ''.<ref>'Sable and Fortune #1, March 2006</ref>

===The Initiative===

Another possibly different Dominic Fortune has been considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to 'Civil War: Battle Damage Report' (2007). 

Again described as a [[Brigandage|Brigand]]-for-hire, this Dominic Fortune has also been shown to be working with a group of vigilantes called the [[Vanguard (comics)#Vanguard (team)|Vanguard]].<ref>'[[Marvel Comics Presents]]' (vol. 2) #5 - 12, February 2008 - October 2008</ref> Once again, the relationship of this Dominic Fortune to others is not known.


==Abilities and equipment==

In his prime, David Fortunov was an athletic man. He was also a superb hand-to-hand combatant and excellent boxer, and an expert marksman and swordsman. In modern times, despite being in excellent physical condition for a man of his age, Dominic Fortune is still quite elderly.

Jerry Fortunov was less physically skilled than his father.  He has a law school degree and is a skilled tax lawyer, however.

Dominic Fortune uses a variety of handguns, especially German "broomhandle" Mauser using 9&nbsp;mm parabellum ammunition.


== Other information ==

There is a error on the last page of 'Iron Man' #213, December 1986. When Iron Man tells Fortune that the Sabbath Raven Fortune had seen with his enemy Steele was in fact the original Sabbath Raven's daughter by Steele's brother, he confuses the relationship - saying to Fortune ''She's the niece of the woman you knew. The daughter of Sabbath, and of Steele's brother.'' She is of course the '''daughter''' of the woman he knew, and thus Steele's niece. 

There is a further link to early Marvel history in 'Marvel Premiere' #56 (October 1980) as it also features Dum-Dum Dugan, who would later become one of [[Sgt_fury|Sgt Fury's Howling Commandos]].
