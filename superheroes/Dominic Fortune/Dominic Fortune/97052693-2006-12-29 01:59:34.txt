==Character history==
Born in [[New York City]], David Jerome Fortunov grew up on that city's [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] during the [[Great Depression]]. After ratting out Olga Cimaglia, a powerful ganster, Fortunov relocated to [[California]] where he changed his name to Dominic Fortune. Living aboard the ''Mississippi Queen'', a floating [[casino]] moored just outside of US territorial waters, Fortune set up shop as an adventurer. He also enjoyed a romantic relationship with the ''Mississippi Queen's'' owner [[Sabbath Raven]] with whom he shared many of his adventures.

After eventually retiring, Fortune returned to being David Fortunov and established himself as a [[Pontiac]] salesman in [[Nassau County, New York]] where he married and had two children. Retirement didn't suit him very well and he reclaimed his identity as Dominic Fortune in order to aid Iron Man in his battle with the [[Iron Monger]]. Fortune's son Jerry witnessed the battle and swore vengeance when he was incorrectly told that his father had been killed. Donning his father's costume, Jerry Fortunov became the new Dominic Fortune.

Unfortunatly, Jerry Fortunov's career as Dominic Fortune was short. Discovering that his father was alive Jerry, with help from Iron Man, attacked the estate of Simon Steele -- the current Iron Monger. Jerry was fatally injured in the battle and died in his father's arms.

Now seeking vengeance for his son's murder, Dominic Fortune tracked Steele to New York where he was hiding aboard the aging remains of the ''Mississippi Queen''. Fortune captured Steele with help from [[Silver Sable]] and her Wild Pack.

==2006==

''[[Sable and Fortune]]'', a 2006 [[limited series]] saw the return of the name Dominic Fortune to published work. In that series a new version of Dominic Fortune joins forces with Silver Sable to stop the plans of traitors from within Silver Sable's own Wild Pack.

In the back of issue #1, editor [[John Barber (comics)|John Barber]] states:
{{cquote|What relationship, if any, the man in this magazine has to the original Dominic Fortune -- remains to be revealed. I know their relationship, but my lips are sealed}}

''Sable and Fortune'' was originally solicited as a six issue series, but was shortened to four after the first issue was released. The story that would have revealed this relationship was never printed.
