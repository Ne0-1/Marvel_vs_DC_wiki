The '''Purple Man''' (real name '''Zebediah Killgrave''') is a recurring [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]].  Most closely associated with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], he was introduced in ''Daredevil'' (1st series) #4 (October 1964).  

==Character history==
[[Image:Dd4purpleman.PNG|165px|Cover to ''Daredevil'' #4, by Jack Kirby.|thumb|left]]

As an international [[spy]] (later described as [[Yugoslavia]]n), Zebediah Killgrave was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery. During the mission, he was accidentally doused with a chemical that altered his pheromones, giving him the ability to control the will power of others, as well as turning his hair and skin purple.  

The Purple Man has vacillated between an actively criminal life and easeful [[retirement]].  Morally, however, he has never reformed.  He can most commonly be seen in expensive purple street clothes. 

He used his mind control powers early in his criminal career to force a woman to become his wife; before she recovered and left him, she was made [[pregnant]] with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.  Kara would inherit his discoloration and powers and would become the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the [[Purple Girl]], and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]].

The character largely disappeared from Daredevil's adventures in the [[1980s]].  He did make a few more appearances in the [[Marvel Universe]], most notably in the graphic novel ''Emperor Doom'' (1987).  Doom was controlling the world with an augmentation machine called 'psycho-prism' he had placed Killgrave into. However, [[Wonder Man]] escaped the mind-control effect, and he managed to break Doom's hold over several selected [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] colleagues. An enraged [[Sub-Mariner]] smashed the device, which resulted in Killgrave's apparent death, although he somehow survived.

===Recent events===
The Purple Man has since been revealed to be linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]]. When she was the superhero Jewel, he used his mind control powers to subdue her, forcing her to live with him while mentally torturing her for several months. He ultimately sent her off to kill Daredevil. Mistaking the [[Scarlet Witch]] for Daredevil, Jones attacked her instead. Jones was beaten into a [[coma]] by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] before they discovered that she had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]]. 

Before helping her out of her coma, the mutant [[telepath]] [[Jean Grey]] was able to give Jones a [[psychic]] switch that would prevent the Purple Man from controlling her again. When Jones recovered, the incident with Purple Man left her so [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tized that she left her life as a superhero behind and became an unsocial private investigator. Later, the Purple Man escaped again and tried controlling Jessica to kill the Avengers, but she was able to resist and knocked him out. Daredevil later had the Purple Man imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]], a jail designed for superpowered criminals.

However he escaped briefly, when [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] created a [[riot]] at the Raft. Purple Man then attempted to use the opportunity to mind control [[Luke Cage]] into killing the then soon-to-be-Avengers, and threatened Jones and the unborn child she was carrying for Cage. Unknown to the Purple Man, drugs had been put into his food to negate his powers during his imprisonment, so he was unable to control Cage, who subsequently beat him to a pulp in response to his demands - however, Zemo saved him from this beating using the moonstones, so Cage only believed himself to be beating him. <!--referencing New Tbolts #12, a rather unsatisfactory explaination borne of the fact that neither the Tbolts nor Avengers writer knew of the others' use of him when NAv:Breakout was written...-->

Later, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the [[House of M]] crisis and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently aquired to leave an image of Purple Man behind in prison so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape. When Zemo, who was only using the Purple Man to "test" the Thunderbolts, learned of his torture of the [[Swordsman (comics)#Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], however, he temporarily sent him back to prison as punishment.

His power enhanced by Zemo's use of the moonstones to allow him to be heard all over New York City simultaneously, he then enslaved the whole city, using the superhumans as his personal army and sex slaves - except the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other. Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]]. Zemo [[teleport]]ed the Purple Man back to him and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.
{{spoiler}}
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Purple Man was able to use the confusion to hijack a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squad and flying platform to escape to Canada.  He was chased by [[U.S. Agent]], but managed to push him off the platform, severely injuring him.  This story is likely to be continued in [[Omega Flight]].

Purple Man believes he lives within a comic book, and breaks the [[fourth wall]], particularly during his run in with Jessica Jones.

== Alternate Versions ==
In an alternate future, Kilgrave becomes [[President for Life]] of the United States, using his powers to remain in office for decades. [[Captain America]], Daredevil and [[Spiderman]] fight against the government and are defeated. While Daredevil and Spiderman are executed, Captain America is shot in the head and sent back in time. He ends up in 1587, though his presence in that time causes an alteration of reality that creates the [[Marvel 1602]] timeline.

== Appearance in other media ==
The Purple Man appeared in the season five fourth episode, "No Mutant Is an Island", of ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' as a telepathic mutant terrorist who plans on taking over the government using a group of young mutants under his mental control. In the end, the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] gets in his way and eventually defeats him.
