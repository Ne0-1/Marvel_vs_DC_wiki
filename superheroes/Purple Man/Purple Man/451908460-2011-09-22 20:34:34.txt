The '''Purple Man''' ('''Zebediah Killgrave''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]].  Originally a foe of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], he was introduced in ''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #4 (October 1964). In recent years, he has been depicted as an enemy of [[Jessica Jones]] and her husband [[Luke Cage]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zebediah Killgrave was born in [[Rijeka]], in what was at the time [[Yugoslavia]] and is now in [[Croatia]]. As an international [[espionage|spy]], he was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery. During the mission, he was accidentally doused with a chemical that turned his hair and skin purple.  Caught outright and questioned, Killgrave offered a weak, inadequate alibi to his captors. Much to his surprise, he was believed and released. Several more incidents of this nature demonstrated that the nerve gas had given Killgrave the superhuman ability to command the wills of other people. Calling himself the Purple Man, Killgrave embarked on a criminal career. 
  
The Purple Man has vacillated between an actively criminal life and easy [[retirement]].  Morally, however, he has never reformed.  He can most commonly be seen in expensive purple street clothes.

He uses his mind control powers early in his criminal career to force a woman to become his wife; before she recovers and leaves him, she becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.  Kara inherits his discoloration and powers and becomes the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the Purple Girl, and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]].

The character largely disappeared from Daredevil's adventures in the 1980s.  He did make a few more appearances in the [[Marvel Universe]], most notably in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel|graphic novel]] ''Emperor Doom''.  Doom uses Killgrave to power a machine called the 'psycho-prism' that allowed Doom to control all minds of everyone on Earth (Doom himself is immune to Killgrave's powers, due to Doom's incredible force of will).  [[Wonder Man]] manages to escape the mind-control effect due to having spent time in a sensory deprivation tank. Wonder Man breaks Doom's hold over several selected [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] colleagues. An enraged [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] smashes the device, which results in Killgrave's [[Comic book death|apparent death]], although he somehow survives.<ref>"Emperor Doom" (1987)</ref>

He later reappeared in the pages of [[Nate Grey|''X-Man'']], where it was revealed that he was the mastermind behind Nate Grey's dramatically sudden rise to super-celebrity status as a miracle worker in New York City. He had been subtly manipulating both the population of Manhattan and Nate himself into accepting and embracing the young exile from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] as a modern [[messiah|messianic figure]], who would then become so psychologically empowered by hero-worship that he could and would literally change the reality of the world using the full potential of his mutant power. The plan ultimately fails when Nate learns the truth and loses his confidence, thus reducing his power.  Killgrave goes once more into hiding.

===Jessica Jones===

{{main|Jessica Jones}}

As detailed in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', the Purple Man has since been revealed to be linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]]. When she was the superhero Jewel, he used his mind control powers to subdue her, forcing her to live with him while psychologically torturing her for several months. He ultimately sends her off to kill Daredevil. Mistaking the [[Scarlet Witch]] for Daredevil, Jones attacks her instead. Jones is beaten into a [[coma]] by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] before they discover that she is [[brainwashing|brainwashed]]. 
 
Before helping her out of her coma, the mutant [[telepathy|telepath]] [[Jean Grey]] is able to give Jones a [[psychic]] switch that prevents the Purple Man from controlling her again. When Jones recovers, the incident with Purple Man leaves her so [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tized that she leaves her life as a superhero behind and becomes an unsocial private investigator. Later, the Purple Man escapes again and tries controlling Jessica to kill the Avengers, but she is able to resist and knocks him out. Daredevil later has the Purple Man imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]], a jail designed for super-powered criminals.

However he escapes briefly, when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] creates a [[riot]] at the Raft. Purple Man then attempts to use the opportunity to mind control [[Luke Cage]] into killing the then soon-to-be-Avengers, and threatens Jones and the unborn child she is carrying for Cage. Unknown to the Purple Man, drugs had been put into his food to negate his powers during his imprisonment, so he is unable to control Cage, who subsequently beats him to a pulp in response to his demands.<ref>''New Avengers vol. 1 #01-03 (Jan-Mar 2005)''</ref> Baron Zemo saves him from this beating using the moonstones, so Cage only believes himself to be beating the Purple Man. <!--referencing New Tbolts #12, a rather unsatisfactory explanation borne of the fact that neither the Tbolts nor Avengers writer knew of the others' use of him when NAv:Breakout was written...-->

===Thunderbolts===
Later, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the [[House of M]] crisis and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently acquired to leave an image of Purple Man behind in prison so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape. When Zemo, who was only using the Purple Man to "test" the Thunderbolts, learned of his torture (implied to have included rape)<ref>''New Thunderbolts #17''</ref> of the [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], however, he temporarily sent him back to prison as punishment.

His power enhanced by Zemo's use of the moonstones to allow him to be heard all over New York City simultaneously, he then enslaved the whole city, using the superhumans as his personal army - except the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other. Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]]. Zemo [[Teleportation|teleport]]ed the Purple Man back to him and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.

===Civil War and beyond===
During the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Purple Man was able to use the confusion to hijack a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squad and flying platform to escape to Canada. He was chased by [[U.S. Agent]], but managed to push him off the platform, severely injuring him. 

The Purple Man's status afterwards was briefly touched upon in ''Super-Villain Team-Up: [[MODOK]]'s 11'', in which he was revealed to have taken over a [[casino]] in Las Vegas; in a flashback in ''New Avengers'' #35, he was among the villains recruited to join The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate, offered 'seeding money' to use as funds to expand the empire.<ref>''[[New Avengers]]'' #35</ref>

During the "Scared Straight" crossover between ''Thunderbolts'' and ''Avengers Academy'', the Purple Man is revealed to be incarcerated in the Raft Maximum Security Penitentiary, as [[Tigra]] warns her Academy students not to look at his face or read his lips.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #3</ref> During a subsequent [[power outage]] caused by Academy member Hazmat, the Purple Man, at the head of a small gang of mind-controlled inmates, again crosses paths with a lone Luke Cage, now supervisor of a Thunderbolts team composed of Raft prisoners.  However, Cage makes short work of the Purple Man and his "recruits", revealing that the [[nanorobotics|nanites]] that maintain control over his Thunderbolts also shield him from Killgrave's influence.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #147</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Purple Man and a majority of inmates are freed after the Raft is severely damaged by the transformation of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] into Kurrth: Breaker of Stone and the subsequent damage caused by Kurrth's escape.<ref name=homefront>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1</ref> Before escaping the Raft, the Purple Man attempts to kill a comatose [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]] in the prison infirmary, and makes statements indicating that he was behind the Puppet Master's manipulation of [[Misty Knight]]'s [[Heroes for Hire#Heroes for Hire (2010)|Heroes for Hire]] organization, using them to establish a criminal organization by proxy while incarcerated. He is prevented from killing the Puppet Master by Heroes for Hire operatives [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], but Killgrave attacks the pair with a mob of mind-controlled inmates driven into a frenzy. When the heroes hold their own against the assault, the Purple Man changes tactics and turns them against each other.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (2010)# 9-10</ref> He subsequently escapes the Raft via the Hudson River.<ref name=homefront/>

==Powers and abilities==
The Purple Manâ€™s body has been altered to produce chemical pheromones which, when inhaled or absorbed through the skin, allow Killgrave to control their actions by verbal suggestions. The effects only last as long as he is physically present and are somehow keyed to his personal voice and speech-pattern. When he departs, the level of chemicals is reduced within his victims at various rates (dependent upon their metabolisms), and then the victims regain full cognizance of self. Killgrave can influence hundreds of people at one time, and his victims can be controlled to perform actions against their will. He also seems to have some control over the release of his pheromones into the atmosphere, as he is able to walk hidden among crowds without influencing everybody. The Purple Man's body has also been mutated so that he is able to recover rapidly from trauma and to heal from severe injuries. In at least one instance, he entered a death-like state while his body healed itself.
Not everyone is susceptible to his mind-control abilities. Doctor Doom has demonstrated that his supreme willpower can easily overcome the Purple Man's powers, while DareDevil is able to resist because being blind allows him to focus his concentration on resisting the Purple Man's verbal commands.

In his appearances in ''Alias'', Purple Man believes he lives within a comic book, and shows the ability to break the [[fourth wall]].<ref>''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #27</ref><ref>''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #28</ref>

==Other versions==
* In an alternate future, Killgrave (or a man similar to him) becomes [[President for Life]] of the United States, using his powers to remain in office for decades. [[Captain America]], Daredevil, and [[Spider-Man]] fight against the government and are defeated. While Daredevil and Spider-Man are executed, Captain America is shot in the head and sent back in time to prevent his remains becoming a symbol for any remaining resistance. He ends up in 1587, though his presence in that time causes an alteration of reality that creates the [[Marvel 1602]] timeline.
* In the ''[[House of M]]'' universe created by the Scarlet Witch, Zebediah Killgrave is a powerless human who works as a lobbyist for the mutant-controlled government, but is secretly an agent of the Human Resistance.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Zebediah Killgrave appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "No Mutant Is an Island." In this episode, he does not use the "Purple Man" alias and in fact uses a face cream to hide his purple complexion in public. He is depicted as a telepathic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] terrorist posing as a philanthropist who plans on taking over the government using a group of young mutants (consisting of [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Rusty Collins]], [[Rictor]], and [[Taki Matsuya|Whiz Kid]]) under his mental control. In the end, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] gets in his way and eventually defeats him.
* Zebediah Killgrave aka The Purple Man appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. He is shown escaping [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], along with other villains.
