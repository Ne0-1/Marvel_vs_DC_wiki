The '''Purple Man''' (real name Zebediah Killgrave) is a recurring [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]].  Most closely associated with [[Daredevil]], he was introduced in ''Davedevil'' volume 1 #4.  As an international spy (later described as [[Yugoslavia]]n), he was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery.  He was accidentally doused with a chemical that dyed his [[hair]] and [[skin]] [[purple]].  When the guard let him go with a flimsy excuse, Killgrave realized that the discoloration had given him [[mind control]] powers.

The Purple Man has vacillated between an actively criminal life and easeful retirement.  Morally, he has never reformed.  He can most commonly be seen in expensive purple street clothes.  He used his mind control powers early in his criminal career to force a woman to become his wife; before she recovered and left him, she was made pregnant with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.  Kara would inherit his discoloration and powers and would become the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the [[Purple Girl]] and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]].

The character largely disappeared from Daredevil's adventures in the [[1980's]], due to [[Frank Miller]]'s lack of interest in him.  He did make a few more appearances in the [[Marvel Universe]], most notably in the employ of [[Doctor Doom]].  His attempt to control the [[Sub-Mariner]] resulted in his apparent death, although he survived.

He has since been revealed to be deeply linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]]. He is somehow linked to the new [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and is stalking and attacking the [[New Thunderbolts]].

The Purple Man was last seen tying to escape The Raft, but was stopped by [[Luke Cage]] after he threatened to kill his wife, [[Jessica Jones]], and his unborn child.
