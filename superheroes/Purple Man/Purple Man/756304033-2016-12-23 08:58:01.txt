==Publication history==
Purple Man first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #4 and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Joe Orlando]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zebediah Killgrave was born in [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]. A physician turned international [[espionage|spy]], he was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery. During the mission, he was accidentally doused with a chemical that turned his hair and skin purple.  Caught outright and questioned, Killgrave offered a weak, inadequate alibi to his captors. Much to his surprise, he was believed and released. Several more incidents of this nature demonstrated that the nerve gas had given Killgrave the superhuman ability to command the wills of other people. Calling himself the Purple Man, Killgrave embarked on a criminal career. 
  
The Purple Man has vacillated between an actively criminal life and easy [[retirement]]. Morally he has never reformed. He can most commonly be seen in expensive purple street clothes.

Early in his criminal career, he used his mind control powers to force a woman to become his wife. Before she recovered and left him, she became pregnant with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.<ref>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #41. Marvel Comics</ref>  Kara inherited his discoloration and powers and became the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the Purple Girl,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]] in ''Alpha Flight'' issue #41.

The character largely disappeared from  adventures in the 1980s.  He did make a few more appearances in the [[Marvel Universe]], most notably in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel|graphic novel]] ''[[Emperor Doom]]''. [[Doctor Doom]] uses Killgrave to power a machine called the "psycho-prism" that allowed Doom to control all minds of everyone on Earth (Doom himself is immune to Killgrave's powers, due to Doom's incredible force of will). [[Wonder Man]] manages to escape the mind-control effect due to the unique transformation his body underwent when it became ion powered. Awakening from an experiment that involved Tony Stark placing him in a sensory deprivation chamber for a month Wonder Man realized to his horror he was the sole being on the planet immune to the Purple Man’s amplified powers. Wonder Man eventually manages to break Doom's hold over several selected [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] colleagues. An enraged [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] smashes the device, which results in Killgrave's [[Comic book death|apparent death]], although he somehow survives.<ref>''Emperor Doom'' (1987). Marvel Comics</ref>

He later reappeared in the pages of ''[[Nate Grey|X-Man]]'', where it was revealed that he was the mastermind behind Nate Grey's dramatically sudden rise to super-celebrity status as a miracle worker in New York City.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He had been subtly manipulating both the population of Manhattan and Nate himself into accepting and embracing the young exile from the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline as a modern [[messiah|messianic figure]], who would then become so psychologically empowered by hero-worship that he could and would literally change the reality of the world using the full potential of his mutant power. The plan ultimately fails when Nate learns the truth and loses his confidence, thus reducing his power.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Killgrave goes once more into hiding.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

As detailed in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', the Purple Man has since been revealed to be linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} When she was the superhero Jewel, he used his mind control powers to subdue her, forcing her to live with him while psychologically torturing her for several months. He ultimately sends her off to kill Daredevil. Mistaking the [[Scarlet Witch]] for Daredevil, Jones attacks her instead. Jones is beaten into a [[coma]] by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] before they discover that she is [[brainwashing|brainwashed]].<ref>''Alias'' #25-26</ref>
 
Before helping her out of her coma, the mutant [[telepathy|telepath]] [[Jean Grey]] is able to give Jones a [[psychic]] switch that prevents the Purple Man from controlling her again. When Jones recovers, the incident with Purple Man leaves her so [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] that she leaves her life as a superhero behind and becomes a private investigator.<ref>''Alias'' #26-28</ref> Later, the Purple Man escapes again and tries controlling Jessica to kill the Avengers, but she is able to resist and knocks him out. Daredevil later has the Purple Man imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]], a jail designed for super-powered criminals.<ref>''Alias'' #28</ref>

He escapes briefly, when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] creates a [[riot]] at the Raft. Purple Man then attempts to use the opportunity to mind control [[Luke Cage]] into killing the then soon-to-be-Avengers, and threatens Jones, who is pregnant with Cage's child. Unknown to the Purple Man, drugs had been put into his food to negate his powers during his imprisonment, so he is unable to control Cage, who subsequently beats him to a pulp in response to his demands.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #01-03 (Jan-Mar 2005). Marvel Comics</ref> Baron Zemo saves him from this beating using the moonstones, so Cage only believes himself to be beating the Purple Man.{{issue|date=January 2013}} <!--referencing ''New Thunderbolts'' #12, a rather unsatisfactory explanation borne of the fact that neither the Thunderbolts nor Avengers writer knew of the others' use of him when NAv:Breakout was written...-->

Later, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the "[[House of M]]" storyline and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently acquired to leave an image of Purple Man behind in prison so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape.{{issue|date=January 2013}} When Zemo, who was only using the Purple Man to "test" the Thunderbolts, learned of his torture (implied to have included rape)<ref>''New Thunderbolts #17''. Marvel Comics</ref> of the [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], he temporarily sent him back to prison as punishment.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

His power enhanced by Zemo's use of the moonstones to allow him to be heard all over New York City simultaneously, he then enslaved the whole city, using the superhumans as his personal army - except the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Zemo [[Teleportation|teleport]]ed the Purple Man back to him and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

During the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Purple Man is able to use the confusion to hijack a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squad and flying platform to escape to Canada. He was chased by [[U.S. Agent]], but managed to push him off the platform, severely injuring him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The Purple Man's status afterwards was briefly touched upon in ''Super-Villain Team-Up: [[MODOK]]'s 11'', in which he was revealed to have taken over a [[casino]] in Las Vegas.{{issue|date=January 2013}} In a flashback in ''New Avengers'' #35, he was among the villains recruited to join The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate, offered "seeding money" to use as funds to expand the empire.<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #35. Marvel Comics</ref>

During the ''Scared Straight'' crossover between ''Thunderbolts'' and ''Avengers Academy'', the Purple Man is revealed to be incarcerated in the Raft Maximum Security Penitentiary, as [[Tigra]] warns her Academy students not to look at his face or read his lips.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref> During a subsequent [[power outage]] caused by Academy member Hazmat, the Purple Man, at the head of a small gang of mind-controlled inmates, again crosses paths with a lone Luke Cage, now supervisor of a Thunderbolts team composed of Raft prisoners. Cage makes short work of the Purple Man and his "recruits", revealing that the [[nanorobotics|nanites]] that maintain control over his Thunderbolts also shield him from Killgrave's influence.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #147. Marvel Comics</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Purple Man and a majority of inmates are freed after the Raft is severely damaged by the transformation of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone and the subsequent damage caused by Kuurth's escape.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Before escaping the Raft, the Purple Man attempts to kill a comatose [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] in the prison infirmary, and makes statements indicating that he was behind the Puppet Master's manipulation of [[Misty Knight]]'s [[Heroes for Hire#Heroes for Hire (2010)|Heroes for Hire]] organization, using them to establish a criminal organization by proxy while incarcerated. He is prevented from killing the Puppet Master by Heroes for Hire operatives [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], but Killgrave attacks the pair with a mob of mind-controlled inmates driven into a frenzy. When the heroes hold their own against the assault, the Purple Man changes tactics and turns them against each other.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (2010)# 9-10. Marvel Comics</ref> He subsequently escapes the Raft via the Hudson River.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #. Marvel Comics</ref>

Purple Man later began to form a new criminal empire with the help of [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Headhunter (comics)|Headhunter]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], a new [[Death-Stalker]], and a new Scourge.<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>

Purple Man also has "Purple Children" as revealed in, ''Daredevil'' Vol 4 #8. They were his offspring by different women he raped over the years. He would get those women pregnant, after making them fall in love with him using his powers, and would later abandon them and make them tell no one.

Over the years, Purple Man kept track of them, and finally decided to gather them one by one. Purple Man hoped he could rule countries with his children and finally know unconditional love. After recovering the fifth son, Jamie, the Purple Children were powerful enough to unite their wills and stand up against their father. They forced Purple Man to walk in front of a train and kill himself. With no one to control them, the Purple Children set out to do whatever they wanted.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

They eventually made their way to San Francisco, and caught the attention of their father's enemy Daredevil after stealing a police car. He managed to stop them, but they soon used the crowd nearby to oppose the vigilante. When SFPD arrived on the scene, the children controlled the officers into shooting at Daredevil, and used the confusion created to escape. They were soon after caught and cornered by Daredevil, but they used their powers to emotionally assault Daredevil, and defeat him, making the hero fall into a gutter.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

The Purple Children targeted an arcade next, where they used their powers to take absolute control of the place. Their father Purple Man, who had survived thanks to his healing factor, followed them, and stealthily started taking them down, one by one. Daredevil managed to save the children and help the police officers surrounding the arcade center by turning up the volume of the music, so Purple Man's commands wouldn't be heard.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

The children were separated and taken to different locations-some had families, others didn't. Due to being out of their "sphere of influence" and separated, they started reverting to normal and lost their powers.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

==Powers and abilities==
The Purple Man’s body has been altered to produce chemical pheromones which, when inhaled or absorbed through the skin, allow Killgrave to control others' actions by verbal suggestions. The effects only last as long as he is physically present and they are somehow keyed to his voice and speech-pattern. When he departs, the level of pheromones is reduced within his victims at various rates (dependent upon their metabolisms), and then the victims regain full cognizance of self. Killgrave can influence hundreds of people at a time, and his victims can be controlled to perform actions against their will. He also has control over the release of his pheromones into the atmosphere, as he is able to walk hidden among crowds without influencing everybody. He is also able to recover rapidly from trauma and to heal from severe injuries. In at least one instance, he has entered a deathlike state while his body healed itself. Not everyone is susceptible to his mind-control abilities. Doctor Doom has demonstrated that his supreme willpower can easily overcome the Purple Man's powers, while Daredevil is able to resist because being blind allows him to focus his concentration on resisting the Purple Man's verbal commands. He is also a skilled manipulator with a high-level intellect.{{issue|date=October 2015}}

In his appearances in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', Purple Man's abilities are not limited to merely controlling the physical actions of his victims, but also some of their cognitive functions: In that series, he speaks to a former victim as if she secretly believes she lives within a comic book and he is aware of her belief, and also causes her to experience visual hallucinations and emotional desires, at his commands.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #27. Marvel Comics</ref><ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #28. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Other versions==
In the alternate future of the series 2003 ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Killgrave becomes [[President for Life]] of the United States, using his powers to remain in office for decades. [[Captain America]], Daredevil, and [[Spider-Man]] fight against the government and are defeated. While Daredevil and Spider-Man are executed, Captain America is shot in the head and sent back in time to prevent his remains becoming a symbol for any remaining resistance. He ends up in 1587, though his presence in that time causes an alteration of reality that creates the [[Marvel 1602]] timeline.

In the alternate timeline seen in the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline created by the [[Scarlet Witch]], Zebediah Killgrave (nicknamed "Zeb") is a powerless human who works as a lobbyist for the mutant-controlled government, but is secretly an agent of the Human Resistance.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' {{issue|date=October 2015}} Marvel Comics</ref>

==In other media==
===Animation===
Zebediah Killgrave appeared in the animated ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "No Mutant is an Island", voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]]. In this episode, he does not use the "Purple Man" alias and in fact uses a face cream to hide his purple complexion in public. He is depicted as a telepathic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] terrorist posing as a philanthropist who plans on taking over the government using a group of young mutants (consisting of [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Rusty Collins]], and [[Taki Matsuya|Wiz Kid]]) under his mental control. In the end, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] gets in his way and eventually defeats him.

The Purple Man appears in the animated series ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Brent Spiner]]. He is shown escaping the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]], along with other villains imprisoned there. In "Emperor Stark", Purple Man is revealed to be the mastermind behind the Avengers becoming world-controlling tyrants within a month by controlling [[Iron Man]] after a defeat, and manipulating him into developing a satellite that could spread his mind-controlling powers to the other Avengers. Only [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] is left immune when being left on self-repair and manages to save the other Avengers.
