== Publication history ==
The Awesome Android [[debut]]ed in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #15 (June 1963) as the creation of the [[Mad Thinker]], and "since then, [the Mad Thinker] and his 15-foot tall artificial being ... have had run-ins with most of Marvel's major superheroes.<ref>Conroy, Mike.

The pair reappeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #28 (July 1964) to battle both the titular superhero team and the mutant superheroes the [[X-Men]]. The Android continued in the role of antagonist, appearing in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #72 (Dec. 1965) as an opponent for [[Iron Man]]; ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #14 (January 1981) against the [[Mattel]]-licensed hero Rom; and in ''[[Captain America]]'' #311 (Nov. 1985). The Android reappeared as part of a supervillain team in ''The Avengers'' #286-289 (Feb.-May 1988); featured in the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' storyline in ''[[Avengers Spotlight]]'' #27 (Mid-Dec. 1989); battled several Marvel heroes in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #2 (June 1997) and ''[[Heroes For Hire]]'' #1 (July 1997) and had two further encounters with the Fantastic Four in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3, #23 (Nov. 1999) and #43-44 (July-Aug. 2001). The Android was reclaimed and upgraded by the Thinker in a humorous storyline in the 2004-2005 series ''[[She-Hulk]]''; and made a brief appearance in ''[[Exiles]]'' vol. 2, #4 (Sept. 2009).

== Fictional character biography ==
The villain the [[Mad Thinker]] creates an artificial lifeform based on the research notes of [[Fantastic Four]] leader [[Mister Fantastic]]. A synthesis of [[ape]] [[DNA]] and [[unstable molecules]] incorporated into an almost indestructible body with a [[microcomputer]] and a [[solar-power]] source, the newly christened ''Awesome Android'' is directed against the Fantastic Four, although the [[superhero]] team defeats both the Android and the Thinker.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #15 (June 1963)</ref> The Awesome Android, still as a pawn of the Thinker, returns to battle the combined efforts of the Fantastic Four and the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] team the [[X-Men]] before being deactivated by X-Men leader [[Professor X]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #28 (July 1964)</ref>

The Thinker directs the Android to [[kidnap]] [[industrialist]] Tony Stark, which eventually leads to a battle with Stark's [[alter ego]] [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #72 (Dec. 1965)</ref> After an appearance during the "War of the Super Villains" storyline<ref>''Iron Man'' #77 (Aug. 1975)</ref> the Android is absent from Marvel continuity until directed by the Thinker to capture the [[Galador]]ian spaceknight ''Rom'' for further study. After a brief battle, Rom successfully deactivates the Android.<ref>''Rom''  #14 (Jan. 1981)</ref> The Android battles ''[[Captain America]]'', having been repaired by then abandoned by the Thinker.<ref>''Captain America'' #311 (Nov. 1985)</ref> Fellow artificial creation the [[Super Adaptoid]], posing as villain the [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Fixer]], reprograms the Android and uses it as part of an assault team of advanced [[robot]]s called Heavy Metal, consisting of the [[Awesome Android]]; [[Machine Man]]; the [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry 459]], and [[TESS-One]]. The group is eventually defeated by the superhero team the ''Avengers'' with ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'' deactivating the Android.<ref>''Avengers'' #286-289 (Feb.-May 1988)</ref>

The Android reappears during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" storyline, being repaired by the robot [[Machinesmith]] and used to distract the Avengers while several villains escape confinement in the prison facility the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. The Android is neutralized by [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27 (Mid-Dec. 1989)</ref> After battles with the superhero teams the ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'',<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #2 (June 1997)</ref> and the ''[[Heroes For Hire]]'',<ref>''Heroes For Hire'' #1 (July 1997)</ref> and two more encounters with the Fantastic Four,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3, #23 (Nov. 1999); #43-44 (July-Aug. 2001)</ref> the Android is reclaimed by the Thinker.  

The Thinker upgrades the Android to absorb additional abilities, such as [[music]]al talent and animal traits. Acquiring [[sentience]], the Android rebels against the Thinker and seeks legal aid from [[law firm]] [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]] (the firm that employs [[Jennifer Walters]], the [[alter ego]] of heroine She-Hulk). The Android is legally [[emancipate]]d from the Thinker, with a court recognizing the being as a male with a new name, "Awesome Andy". Andy becomes a general office worker for the firm; lacking speech, he communicates via hand-gestures, body language, and a message board around his neck. The the board, originally depicted as a chalk board, was [[retcon]]ned into a digital display screen with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection to his [[CPU]].

After a brief fight with a member of the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]]s, [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]], Andy inadvertently absorbs Starfox's [[pheromone]]-like abilities, causing Andy to gain the affections of his coworker Mallory Book. Upon realizing she does not actually reciprocate these feelings, the character deactivates his powers, and, after being rejected by her, leaves the law firm.<ref>''She Hulk'' #2 (June 2004); #4 (Aug. 2004); #6-9 (Oct. 2004 - Jan. 2005); #11-12 (March - April 2005); #14 (February 2007)</ref> Andy reappears as the Awesome Android in the employ of the Thinker, having reset its system with no trace of the previous personality.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #20 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

The Android also encounters the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] team the ''[[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2, #4 (Sept. 2009)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
The Awesome Android is created when the Mad Thinker steals and uses a technique invented by Mister Fantastic, involving splicing unstable molecules into the DNA patterns of an ape. The character has limited artificial intelligence and no capacity for self-motivated activity, and is totally dependent on its programming or on the spoken commands of its programmer, and usually deactivates itself when not active. 

The Android has super strength and durability, and can also mimic an ability (one at a time) after touching an opponent, such as the strength and epidermis of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] or the frost coating of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. The character can also emit close-range blasts of [[gale|gale-force wind]] from its mouth. The Android is given one weakness by the Thinker: a collection of [[Nervous system|nerve]] [[Ganglion|ganglia]] underneath the left armpit that if struck will cause the Android to shut down.<ref>''Avengers''  #286 (May 1988)</ref>

== Other versions ==
===Ultimate Awesome Android===

The character is the younger brother and slave of Rhona Burchill, the [[Mad Thinker#Ultimate Thinker|Mad Thinker]].<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #19-20 (July-Aug. 2005)</ref>
