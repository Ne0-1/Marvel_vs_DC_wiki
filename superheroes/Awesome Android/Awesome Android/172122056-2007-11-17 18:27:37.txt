The '''Awesome Android''', later known as '''Awesome Andy''' for a time, is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[artificial life]]form<!--created using DNA; that makes it lifeform, that just mechanical or electronic android--> in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]''  #15 (June 1963) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].

==Publication history==
Following its debut as "the Awesome Android" and a pawn of the villain the [[Mad Thinker]], the character returned in ''Fantastic Four'' #28 (July 1964) to battle the Fantastic Four and the mutant [[X-Men]]. Two decades later, the creature appeared as an antagonist in ''Rom''  #14 (Jan. 1981) and ''The Avengers'' #286-289 (Feb.-May 1988). The Android was next seen, salvaged and having gained sentience, as office worker "Awesome Andy" in the 2004-2005 series ''[[She-Hulk]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
The Awesome Android is a synthesis of [[ape]] [[DNA]] and [[unstable molecules]] incorporated into an almost indestructible android body with a [[microcomputer]] and a [[solar-power]] source. The Awesome Android is a [[tabula rasa]] with no personality. It has no capacity for self-motivated activity, and is totally dependent on its programming or on the spoken commands of its programmer, and usually deactivates itself when it has no current program to run.

The Android's creator, the Mad Thinker, twice uses it against the superhero team the Fantastic Four. When the Mad Thinker occupies the [[Baxter Building]], the Android is deactvated by the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #15</ref> and the second time the Mad Thinker and [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]] dispatch it against the Fantastic Four and the original [[X-Men]], until [[Professor X]] mentally deactivates the Android.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #28</ref> The Android has a minor encounter with the "[[Spaceknights|spaceknight]]" [[Rom the Spaceknight|Rom]] many years later, when the Thinker sends it to incapacitate Rom for study.  The Android suffers a programming breakdown and subdues the Thinker instead.<ref>''Rom'' #14</ref> The Mad Thinker repairs it and abandons it, and it subsequently battles [[Captain America]]. <ref>''Captain America'' #311</ref> The [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] reprograms it, and sends it against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but the heroine [[She-Hulk]] deactivates it. <ref>''Avengers''  #286</ref>

The now-abandoned Android is found and reprogrammed by the mimicking robot called the [[Super-Adaptoid]] in order to serve in a group of robotic and similar beings, '''Heavy Metal'''. Following that group's attack of [[Avengers Mansion]], [[Namor|Namor, the Sub-Mariner]] removes the Awesome Android's head, leaving the body to sink into the ocean. <ref>''Avengers'' #289</ref> The Android is eventually repaired by the [[Machinesmith]] to distract the Avengers while other robots escape confinement, but is this time neutralized by [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]]. <ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #27</ref>

The Mad Thinker eventually rebuilds the Android, and upgrades it to absorb abilities apart from superhuman powers, such as musical talent and animal traits. The Android later turns on the Mad Thinker, and acquiring sentience seeks legal aid from [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]], the law firm that employs Jennifer Walters, the superhero [[She-Hulk]]. <ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #14 (Feb. 2007)</ref>

The firm legally emancipates the Android from the Mad Thinker, <!--takes seven years to be naturalized as a citizen--> with the court recognizing its new name, "Awesome Andy", and officially considering him male. Andy becomes a general office worker for the firm, finding this more fulfilling than doing the Mad Thinker's bidding. As Andy, the Android shows that he cares deeply for his friends and coworkers and was willing to fight to protect them.  As the Mad Thinker did not give him the ability to speak, Awesome Andy communicated via hand-gestures, body language, and a message board strung around his neck.  Initially, the display board was depicted as a chalk board (which displayed messages much faster than could be written in real time), but was [[retcon]]ned into being a digital display screen with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection to his CPU.

After a brief fight with the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]], Andy inadvertently absorbs Starfox's [[pheromone]]-like abilities, causing Andy to gain the affections of his coworker Mallory Book.  Upon realizing she does not actually reciprocate those feelings, he deactivates his powers, causing her to reject him angrily. Guilty over his inadvertent actions, he leaves the law firm to find himself.

Andy reappears as a blank slate, having reset his system and leaving no trace of his previous personality, and returns to the employ of the Mad Thinker. <ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #20 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
[[Image:FF15 1960s.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #15 (June 1963). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Dick Ayers]].]]
The Android is tall, hulking creature with a malleable body and a head it can set as rectangular or as a cube. It has no eyes, nose, or visible ears. The Android can mimic certain abilities after touching its opponent (e.g. the strength and epidermis of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]). The Android can also emit close-range blasts of [[gale|gale-force wind]] from its mouth.

Its weakness is a [[fail safe]] built into it by the Mad Thinker: a collection of [[Nervous system|nerve]] [[Ganglion|ganglia]] underneath the left armpit that if struck will cause the Android to shut down.<ref>''The Avengers''  #286 (May 1988)</ref>

==In other media==
The Awesome Android appeared in the 1966 [[animated series]] ''[[The Marvel Superheroes]]'', in the [[Sub-Mariner]] episode "Dr. Doom's Day".

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Awesome Android===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the android is only referred to as Bobby Burchill, the younger brother of Rhona Burchill (this [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]'s Mad Thinker). When they were young, Rhona took part of Bobby's [[brain]] matter and transplanted it into hers in order to increase her brain power. This left Bobby [[mental retardation|mentally handicapped]]. It has not been revealed what other processes Rhona performed on Bobby to turn him into the android-like creature he became.  Bobby possesses superhuman strength and his body is made of a black, malleable metal which he can use to create various weapons.
