'''Lana Lang''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Superman]] stories.

In the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of the character, Lana played the equivalent of [[Lois Lane]]'s role as a romantic foil in the [[Superboy]] stories. A grown-up version of Lana Lang later appeared in Superman stories, eventually moving to [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]] to become a television journalist and a romantic rival to Lois, appearing in several issues of ''Superman's Girl Friend Lois Lane'' besides the regular ''Superman'' series.

In the Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version, Lana was a childhood friend to Clark who eventually made privy to his abilities before he set out to use them for good.  She made much less contact with Clark since then, but they share a close friendship.

In the television series ''[[Smallville]]'', Lana, played by [[Kristin Kreuk]] is again the (often forbidden) love interest of the young [[Clark Kent]], with at least some of each episode devoted to their potentially developing relationship.
