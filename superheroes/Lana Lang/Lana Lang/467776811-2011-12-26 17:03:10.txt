'''Lana Lang''' is a [[fictional]] [[supporting character]] in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' series. Created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist John Sikela, the character [[First appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]'' #10 (September/October 1950). Across decades of ''Superman'' comics and adaptations into other media, Lana has most consistently been depicted as [[Superman]]'s teenage [[romantic interest]] growing up in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]]; as an adult, she is a distant friend of Superman in his civilian identity as [[Clark Kent]]. 

Lana is also one of many ''Superman'' characters with the [[Alliteration|alliterative]] initials "LL", the most notable other examples being Superman's principal love interest [[Lois Lane]] and archnemesis, [[Lex Luthor]]. In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], she regularly appeared in comic books depicting the adventures of Superman's teenaged self, [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]], and also appeared as an adult in numerous ''Superman'' titles, vying with Lois Lane for his attention. In [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] revisions to DC Comics [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], she and Clark are shown to have remained close friends since their teenage years. The precise story varies across differing revisions of [[Origin of Superman|Superman's origin story]]. For example, in ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'' (2009-10), Lana becomes privy to Clark's unusual abilities at an early age and becomes his earliest confidant outside of his parents and the futuristic [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. 

Lana has been featured in most other media adaptations of ''Superboy'' media, typically as a teenager. These portrayals include both the [[Superboy (TV series)|''Adventures of Superboy'']] television series (1988-92), where she is portrayed by [[Stacy Haiduk]], and the [[The WB Television Network|WB]]/[[UPN]] television series ''[[Smallville]]'' (2001-11), in which she is played by [[Kristin Kreuk]]. Lana appears in all 100 episodes of ''Adventures of Superboy'', and in Smallville is teenage [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s primary romantic interest throughout the show's first seven seasons. She has also appeared in many adaptations of ''Superman'' stories, although her role is generally smaller. In the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Superman III]],'' she is played by [[Annette O'Toole]] (who would later portray [[Martha Kent]] in ''Smallville''). 

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age and Bronze Age===
====Earth-One version====
In the original Superboy stories, Lana was the girl who lived next door to the Kent family in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], and was a romantic interest of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]. In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] stories, Lana often behaved like a younger version of Lois, spending much of her time trying to prove that Superboy and Clark Kent were [[secret identity#Secret identities in fiction|one and the same]].

At one point, Lana once rescued an insect-like [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] trapped by a fallen tree in Smallville. In gratitude, the alien gave her a "bio-genetic" ring which allowed Lana to gain insect (and insect-like, such as [[arachnid]]s) characteristics. Lana created a yellow [[honeybee]]-like costume and mask, and took the name "[[Insect Queen (DC Comics)|Insect Queen]]", under which identity Lana had several adventures.

Lana also had various adventures with Superboy, and several with the futuristic superhero team the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Also appearing in some Silver Age stories was Lana's uncle, [[Professor Potter]], an eccentric inventor.

After Clark and Lana graduated from high school, Lana went to college, and eventually became a television reporter; as an adult, she became a rival to Lois Lane for Superman's romantic affection in various 1960s stories, often appearing in the title ''Superman's Girlfriend, Lois Lane''.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, Lana became an anchorwoman for WGBS-TV's evening news in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], as a co-anchor to Clark Kent. Her attraction to Superman during this time had also died off, leaving Superman to Lois. Lana later became romantically linked to the alien super-hero [[Vartox]]. Eventually, she and Clark Kent became romantically involved in stories prior to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

====Earth-Two version====
In the early 1980s, with the use of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system DC had in place, Lana Lang was also shown in several stories to have had an [[Earth-Two]] counterpart (Earth-Two at the time the home of the [[Justice Society of America]] and DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] versions of its characters, versus its mainstream universe of "Earth-One"). The Earth-Two Lana Lang was introduced in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #203 (September–October 1980). In this story, set in the early 1950s, Lana Lang joins the ''[[Daily Planet#Golden-Age|Daily Star]]'' staff as a television critic. She relates to Clark Kent that she and her family left [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] when she was very young, explaining why they hadn't met during their youth unlike the Earth-One versions.

Later, she became an Insect Queen like her Earth-One counterpart; in this case, Lana had received a mystic amulet from her archaeologist father, said amulet having been created to allow a [[Pharaoh]] to control and divert the [[locust]] hordes that threatened ancient [[Egypt]]. Unfortunately, the charm associated with the amulet was set to be energized by the sound of approaching insect wings; by unfortunate coincidence, the sound of Superman's super-speed flying was similar enough to activate the spell. Lana was thus compelled to create a [[Chitin]]ous golden-brown costume (woven by [[silkworm]]s under her control) and adopt a villainous alter ego, the Insect Queen. After an initial clash with Superman, the Insect Queen fell under the mental influence of Superman's enemy, the [[Ultra-Humanite]], who kept her under the spell's compulsion and prevented her from reverting to normal. Earth-Two's Superman was able to locate an [[antidote]] to the spell, which Lois Lane used to remove the compulsion (''Superman Family'' #213, December 1981), letting Lana break free of Ultra's influence and making her able to use the amulet's power at her own discretion. The Earth-2 Insect Queen would later use her abilities to aid Superman in times of need. This version of Lana Lang phased out of existence during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

===Modern Age===

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was written, various aspects of Lana's history were [[retcon]]ned, starting with comics writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', which was designed to rewrite Superman's origin from scratch. In the post-Crisis version of events, Lana was a childhood friend of Clark, with a certain degree of romantic tension in the air as Lana had long pined after Clark, who had loved her only platonically in return.

After they graduated from high school Clark took Lana on a private walk, saying that he had to tell her something important, which Lana honestly expected to be a marriage proposal. He then divulged to her that he had superpowers, displayed by flying her around the world, before explaining that he felt he had to leave Smallville to help humanity as a whole. Kissing her goodbye "like a brother," Lana was left in considerable shock, not only over the revelation of Clark's superpowers, but also over the final realization that he held no reciprocal romantic feelings towards her, leaving Lana heartbroken and alone. When Lana finally aired her grievance with him years later{{Issue|date=February 2010}}, Clark felt very badly over how he had hurt her.

When Clark appeared in public as Superman some years later, the lonely and depressed Lana deduced his true identity and became something of a [[Stalking|stalker]], to the extent that [[Lex Luthor]] noticed the frequency with which she appeared in the vicinity of the hero and actually had her [[torture]]d in an attempt to gain whatever inside knowledge of Superman she might have.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} However, Lana bravely kept Clark's identity a secret and upon his rescuing her their relationship became more healthy once again, albeit still at a distance. Unlike the pre-Crisis Earth-One continuity, Lana did not go on to have a journalistic career, compete with Lois for Superman's affections, nor play a significant role in Clark's life in Metropolis.

Lana's relationship with Clark is again altered in 2003's ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' [[limited series]] by [[Mark Waid]], which again revises Superman's origins.  This storyline, which takes some inspiration from the TV show ''Smallville'' (such as the appearance of Ma and Pa Kent), also shows Clark and Lana to have had a mutual romantic relationship during their youth.  At the start of the storyline, Lana has already left Smallville prior to Clark's return from his world journey.  Upon his arrival home, a disappointed Clark is told that Lana left some time prior and has not been heard from since.  Following this storyline, there is never again made mention of her past history regarding Clark or Superman.

Lana's "Birthright" history has been yet again re-made following the events of the [[Infinite Crisis]], which has revived Clark's pre-''Crisis'' Superboy alter-ego.  In this new history, Lana had a deep romantic relationship with Clark, that was often interrupted by her two obnoxious brothers (which she lacked in previous versions).  The full extent of her history and her connection to Superboy/Clark has not yet been fully disclosed.  Again, her previous history has not been mentioned since this revision.

Years later, the post-''Crisis'' Lana eventually married [[Pete Ross]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The two settled into a quiet life in Smallville, where they had a son they named after their mutual friend, Clark, after Lana asked Clark to save the baby's life when a car accident caused him to be born eight weeks premature; although Clark's efforts to take him to receive care were interrupted by the attack of the [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]-controlled [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Brainiac's subsequent attempts to use the baby's [[DNA]] to create a new body for himself brought the baby to full term.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Pete began a career in politics that got him elected to the [[United States Senate|Senate]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} In 2000, Senator Ross became Lex Luthor's [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] running mate in Luthor's bid to become [[President of the United States|President]], and after the two won, Lana moved to [[Washington, D.C.]]{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Eventually, Luthor was forced from his office, and Pete Ross became President (and Lana the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]]){{Issue|date=April 2009}}. As she and Pete began to drift apart, Lana began to subtly attempt to regain Clark's affections, much to the anger of his (now) wife Lois Lane{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. Pete and Lana briefly reunited after Superman saved them from being killed by the villainous [[Ruin (comics)|Ruin]] in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]{{Issue|date=April 2009}}.

In ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #654, [[Perry White]] reported that Lana had become [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Lexcorp]] following the ousting of founder Lex Luthor. In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #49, it is revealed that she sold [[Kryptonite]] to the government to prevent Lexcorp from going under, and had caches of Kryptonite placed all over the planet, as a last-ditch defense if Superman should ever go rogue. When Superman and Batman come to remove the Kryptonite, Lana refuses to hand it over, and pushes a button which turns the caches into "[[dirty bomb]]s" which spread Kryptonite molecules through the entire planet, forcing all [[Kryptonian]]s to vacate. However, [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Toyman]] uses special [[nanobot]]s to remove all of the Kryptonite molecules, undoing the damage. Superman meets with Lana again, with Lana telling him she was left with no choice. Superman responds by telling her that, while he does sometimes wonder what things would have been like if he had married her rather than Lois, there is a reason he is with Lois instead of her: Lois would never have pushed the button. After Superman flies off, someone is shown watching Lana crying on a screen, saying to her "you did perfect".  ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #63 suggests that this was [[Gorilla Grodd]]. 

She later tries to help Superman, facing the time-traveling strongman [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]], by sending the Luthor Squad. This act activates a dormant program inside the Lexcorp mainframes, an holographic version of Luthor. The holographic copy of Luthor informs Lana that by helping Superman she has violated the Lexcorp standard contract of employment ("very, very fine print"), that forbids Lexcorp employers to use Lexcorp resources for helping Kryptonians, under the penalty of termination. Lana is given five minutes to leave the building, or she will be shot to death.<ref>''Superman'' #678</ref>

New ''[[Supergirl]]'' writer [[Sterling Gates]] tells [[Newsarama]] "We're integrating Supergirl's book more into the Superman universe, and that includes having a supporting cast that overlaps with that world. I'm very interested in tying her back in to Metropolis and making sure that her world is a part of the Superman universe. [[Cat Grant]] will be a regular supporting cast member, as will Lana Lang."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080627-WWCSupergirlteam.html |title=Wwc-Gates And Igle Named As Supergirl Team |publisher=Newsarama.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

Lana takes it upon herself to reach out to Supergirl. She offers her advice and friendship. Around the same time, [[Perry White]] has been actively pursuing Lana to take over the Business section of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', a position which Lana was afraid to accept, following her bad experience with Lexcorp. Eventually, Lana and Supergirl decide together that Lana will accept the position, and that Supergirl will take on the secret identity of Linda Lang, niece of Lana Lang. Lana now lives in Metropolis with Supergirl, and is working as the editor of the Business section of the ''Daily Planet''.

She briefly returns to Smallville to attend [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan Kent]]'s funeral. However, unable to muster enough resolve to patch up things with Clark, Lana leaves before giving him her condolences.<ref>''Superman: New Krypton'' (2008)</ref>

While attending a student journalism award ceremony with Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant, Lana suddenly collapses, with blood pouring out her nose.;<ref>''Supergirl'' (Vol. 5) #40</ref> She receives a call from her doctor telling her that he has "bad news" for her.<ref>''Supergirl'' (Vol. 5) #45</ref> Following another collapse, Lana is taken to hospital and operated on. She apparently dies on the operating table, but her body is later encased in a cocoon by black insect-like creatures, which then starts to crack open.<ref>''Supergirl'' (Vol. 5) #49</ref> The hospital is soon engulfed by a gigantic cocoon-like structure, and a number of workers as well as the [[Science Police]] and the [[Guardian (comics)|Guardian]] are taken hostage by an army of giant insects. Supergirl is soon captured and awakens bound and gagged at the feet of Lana, who is now possessed by the Insect Queen. The Queen reveals to Supergirl that during her last encounter with Lana, she injected her with a portion of her DNA and has been slowly taking control of her body for the past year, with the ultimate goal of capturing a Kryptonian to use as a template for an army of hybird insects. Supergirl breaks free and is able to expel the Queen from Lana's body with help from Kryptonian technology, and Lana returns to her normal state. While recovering, Lana is visited by Supergirl, who tells her she can no longer be a part of her family due to her lies about her condition.<ref>''Supergirl'' (Vol. 5) #50</ref> Lana and "Linda" have since reconciled and are currently living in the Hammersmith tower building in Metropolis. <ref>''Supergirl'' (Vol. 5) #53</ref>

==In other media==
===''The Adventures of Superboy''===
[[Image:Clark and Lana.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bunny Henning]] as Lana Lang in ''The Adventures of Superboy''.]]
In the failed 1961 TV pilot ''The Adventures of Superboy'', Lana Lang made her first live-action appearance, portrayed by Bunny Henning, alongside [[Johnny Rockwell]] as Superboy.

Beginning in [[1966 in television|1966]], Lana appeared in ''[[The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' segments that were featured in the animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and other series. She was voiced by [[Janet Waldo]].

===''Superman: The Movie''===
In Richard Donner's ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' in 1978, Lana Lang had a brief appearance in a scene at Smallville High. She was shown to be a cheerleader at the school with a fairly obvious crush on Clark, even though her current boyfriend was a football player named Brad. She was portrayed by [[Diane Sherry]].

===''Superman III''===
In the 1983 movie ''[[Superman III]]'', Lana was played by [[Annette O'Toole]]. In an interview for the documentary ''Look Up In The Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman'', O'Toole states that the producers of ''Smallville'' (where she plays Clark's own adoptive mother, [[Martha Kent]]) were not aware that she had appeared in ''Superman III'' until after she was cast in the TV series. In ''Superman III'', Lana is a divorcee with a son named Ricky. Lana's former boyfriend Brad, a former [[Jock (subculture)|jock]] and Clark's childhood [[bullying|bully]], is now a security guard and is still vying for her attention.

===''Superboy'' (TV series)===
In the late 1980s-early 1990s [[Superboy (TV series)|''Superboy'']] television series, Lana was played by [[Stacy Haiduk]]. In this version, she was a lifelong friend of Clark, who accompanied him to Shuster University (named after Superman's co-creator) and later the Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters, where she and Clark investigated all of the unusual incidents that took place in Capitol City, Florida.

===''Superman'' (1988 TV series)===
Lana also appeared in the ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' [[1988 in television|1988]] [[Animated series|animated]] Saturday morning [[television series]] produced by [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and had a 13-episode run. It's also notable for being the first appearance of the Superman mythos following [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s major relaunch of the character from 1986. The final four minutes of each Superman episode were devoted to a brief snapshot from the "Superman Family Album." These biographical segments deviated from the contemporary comics to have Clark have his powers fully developed since infancy as opposed to developing as he matured. These stories depicted the [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] misadventures of the young [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] immigrant as he faces typical childhood trials with his first day at school, an overnight scouting campout, getting a driver's license, his first date, and more. Lana was featured in some of these "Superman Family Album" flashback segments, but never appeared during the regular episode story segment.

===''Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman''===
Lana made one appearance in ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', where she was played by [[Emily Procter]] (best known as [[Calleigh Duquesne]] in TV's ''[[CSI: Miami]]''). Lana's appearance was in an episode set in an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] where Lois had vanished on a trip in the Amazon before Clark's arrival in Metropolis and a ''blonde'' Lana was engaged to Clark, encouraging him to keep his abilities secret, constantly telling him that he would be locked up and sent to a government laboratory if people knew what he was capable of. When the mainstream universe's Lois persuaded that world's Clark to become Superman to battle the villain [[Tempus]], Lana ended their relationship.

===''Superman: The Animated Series''===
The pilot episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' followed the "[[post-Crisis]]" comics, with Lana being the first person Clark confided in about his superpowers. The young Lana was voiced by [[Kelley Schmidt]], and the adult version by [[Joely Fisher]]. She mentioned she had a crush on him since the age of three. Lana, as an adult, appeared in later episodes as a world-famous fashion designer and still retained romantic feelings for her old friend (it is mentioned that they used to date).

Adult Lana first appears in "[[My Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)|My Girl]]", already having deduced Superman's identity, when her relationship with Lex Luthor breaks off after she tries to pass information on to Clark about Luthor's plots. She later plays a prominent role in "Obsession" and a cameo in the ending of the episode "The Late Mr. Kent", providing a cover story for Clark's reappearance after he was presumed dead after an attempt on his life.

===''Justice League''===
Lana appears in a cameo in the episode "Hereafter", at Superman's funeral. She also makes an appearance (as a combination of Lois and Lana) as Superman's wife in the dream induced by [[Mongul]] in "For The Man Who Has Everything", under the name of Loana. In this dreamworld, they both live on Krypton, along with [[Jor-El]], and have a son named Van-El.

===''Smallville''===
[[File:Lana Lang Smallville.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kristin Kreuk]] portrays Lana Lang in ''[[Smallville]]'']]
{{Main|Lana Lang (Smallville)}}

In the 2000s television series ''[[Smallville]]'', Lana, played by [[Kristin Kreuk]], is again the love interest of the young [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]. In a marked contrast to the redhead Lana Lang who appears in the Superman comic books, Kreuk is a brunette with an olive complexion. Lana is said to be descended on her mother's side from a French [[witchcraft|witch]], Countess Marguerite Isobel Theroux, whose vengeful spirit returns to possess her in a story line taking up much of season 4.

In ''Smallville'', Lana and Clark's relationship is depicted (at least initially) as the complete reverse of the post-Crisis version, whereby it was "Clark who long pined over Lana without the other really knowing." This initial scenario also incorporated elements of the 1978 movie continuity by introducing the character of [[Whitney Fordman]], Lana's quarterback boyfriend and Clark's antagonist at the beginning of the series. Following Whitney's departure at the end of the first season, their relationship varied over the next few years, Clark occasionally attempting to date Lana before his fears over her reaction to his secret caused him to retreat, these fears made even worse since he blames himself for the death of Lana's parents in the same meteor shower that brought him to Smallville. Although the two begin dating at the end of Season Four after Clark's powers are taken from him by [[Jor-El]] as punishment for disobeying him, he begins to draw back after he regains his abilities because he is afraid of hurting her if they are intimate. 

Although he reveals his secret in the mid-season finale of Season Five, he turns back time and erases this confession when Lana is killed in an accident, subsequently breaking up with her after his father's death- due to Jor-El saving his life at the beginning of the season, the life of someone he loved was taken in his place- because he feels guilty about lying to her. Although Lana goes on to date and marry Lex Luthor after discovering that she is apparently pregnant, the two divorce when Lana learns that Lex faked her pregnancy to get her to marry him, Lana once again dating Clark after he admits his secret to her. Although they are involved for most of Season Seven, Lana's attempts to plan to take down Lex while spying on him without Clark's knowledge, along with such factors as her spending two weeks involved with Clark's [[Phantom Zone]] [[Bizarro|duplicate]] without realising the difference or being attacked and sent into a coma by the machinations of Brainiac, culminate in Lana leaving him at the end of the season. 

Lana returned in Season Eight after acquiring superpowers which equally matched that of Clark due to a special suit developed by Lex Luthor. Both Clark and Lana worked together to save people but it takes a twist when one of Lana's powers involved having the ability to drain power from kryptonite, resulting in her being constantly 'irradiated' by kryptonite, weakening Clark when he got close to her.  Lex Luthor, as a last attempt for revenge, threatens to blow up the entire Daily Planet building with kryptonite explosives unless Lana drained all the radiation from them, leaving her a walking piece of kryptonite. She and Clark share a kiss before they decide she has to absorb the kryptonite from the bomb. Later at the barn, Clark heart broken attempts to kiss Lana despite his agony, and as he does green veins crawl up his face, showing that he is dying from the intimate exposure. Lana breaks off the kiss, not being able to stand the pain it was causing Clark, and she runs off with tears to go on her own quest. Clark is left on his knees devastated.

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
Lana makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Battle of the Superheroes!", an episode that pays tribute to a number of Silver Age Superman stories. In a scene that directly homages the cover to ''Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane'' #26, Lana and a [[Red Kryptonite]]-infected Superman are shown relaxing together on a beach while a stunned Lois watches them in horror.

===DC Universe Online===
Lana appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' video game, voiced by [[Lorrie Singer]].
