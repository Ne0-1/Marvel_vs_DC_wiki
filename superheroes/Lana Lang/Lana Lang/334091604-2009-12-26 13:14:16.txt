'''Lana Lang''' is a [[fictional]], [[supporting character]] in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' series. Created by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist John Sikela, she [[First appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]'' #10 (September-October 1950). 

Lana traditionally has been [[Superman]]'s romantic interest when they were [[Adolescence|teenagers]] in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]]. In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], she regularly appeared in series featuring the character’s teenaged self, [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]. She also often appeared as an adult in Superman series, vying with current love interest [[Lois Lane]] for his attention.

In the [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] DC Comics [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], she and [[Clark Kent]] were and still are close friends with a certain degree of romantic tension between them.  Furthermore, in the current version of Superman's origin story in ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'', Lana is made privy to Clark's unusual abilities from an early age, becoming his only confidant in his childhood outside his parents and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  For a time, Lana is married to [[Pete Ross]], Clark Kent's best friend as a youth, and has a son named Clark Peter Ross by Pete.

Lana has been featured in most other media adaptations of Superboy or Superman as a teenager, including the series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' where she is played by [[Kristin Kreuk]]. She has also appeared in many adaptations of Superman, although her role is generally smaller. An exception is the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Superman III]],'' where she was played by [[Annette O'Toole]] (who also plays [[Martha Kent]] in the TV show ''Smallville'') and was the character’s main romantic interest. Prior to ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', Lana was a regular cast member in the half hour live-action ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' television series, played by [[Stacy Haiduk]] in the entire 100 episode run. Up to this point in time, it was this series that gave the Lana Lang character more exposure than any other media adaptation of the Superman saga{{Fact|date=February 2009}}. The show ran from 1988–1992 in first-run [[broadcast syndication|syndication]].

Lana is one of several Superman characters with the [[Alliteration|alliterative]] initials "LL", including her father Professor Lewis Lang, [[Lex Luthor]], [[Lionel Luthor]], [[Lena Luthor]] (whose surname was changed to "Thorul" in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], to distance herself from her criminal brother), [[Lois Lane]], [[Lucy Lane]], Superman's Babysitter [[Letitia Lerner]], [[Lori Lemaris]], Leta Lal (a distant ancestor of Lori Lemaris), [[Luma Lynai]], [[Lyla Lerrol]], [[Linda Lee]] (aka [[Supergirl]]), [[Lara Lor-Van]] (Superman's Kryptonian mother), and Lara-El (an [[Superman & Batman: Generations|alternate timeline]] daughter of [[Superman]] and [[Forever People#Beautiful Dreamer|Beautiful Dreamer]]). Even Superman's birth name is Ka''l''-E''l''.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Earth-One Lana Lang ===
[[Image:lana and clark 1980.png|left|thumb|175px|Lana Lang (left) and [[Clark Kent]] (right). From ''New Adventures of Superboy'' #4 (March 1980). Art by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].]]
In the original Superboy stories, Lana was the girl who lived next door to the Kent family in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], and was a romantic interest of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]. In the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] stories, Lana often behaved like a younger version of Lois, spending much of her time trying to prove that Superboy and Clark Kent were [[secret identity#Secret identities in fiction|one and the same]].

At one point, Lana once rescued an insect-like [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] trapped by a fallen tree in Smallville. In gratitude, the alien gave her a "bio-genetic" ring which allowed Lana to gain insect (and insect-like, such as [[arachnid]]s) characteristics. Lana created a yellow [[honeybee]]-like costume and mask, and took the name "[[Insect Queen (comics)|Insect Queen]]", under which identity Lana had several adventures.

Lana also had various adventures with Superboy, and several with the futuristic superhero team the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Also appearing in some Silver Age stories was Lana's uncle, [[Professor Potter]], an eccentric inventor.

After Clark and Lana graduated from high school, Lana went to college, and eventually became a television reporter; as an adult, she became a rival to Lois Lane for Superman's romantic affection in various 1960s stories, often appearing in the title ''Superman's Girlfriend, Lois Lane''.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, Lana became an anchorwoman for WGBS-TV's evening news in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], as a co-anchor to Clark Kent. Her attraction to Superman during this time had also died off, leaving Superman to Lois. Lana later became romantically linked to the alien super-hero [[Vartox]]. Eventually, she and Clark Kent became romantically involved in stories prior to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

=== Earth-Two Lana Lang ===
In the early 1980s, with the use of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system DC had in place, Lana Lang was also shown in several stories to have had an [[Earth-Two]] counterpart (Earth-Two at the time the home of the [[Justice Society of America]] and DC's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] versions of its characters, versus its mainstream universe of "Earth-One"). The Earth-Two Lana Lang was introduced in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #203 (September-October 1980). In this story, set in the early 1950s, Lana Lang joins the ''[[Daily Planet#Golden-Age|Daily Star]]'' staff as a television critic. She relates to Clark Kent that she and her family left [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] when she was very young, explaining why they hadn't met during their youth unlike the Earth-One versions.

Later, she became an Insect Queen like her Earth-One counterpart; in this case, Lana had received a mystic amulet from her archaeologist father, said amulet having been created to allow a [[Pharaoh]] to control and divert the [[locust]] hordes that threatened ancient [[Egypt]]. Unfortunately, the charm associated with the amulet was set to be energized by the sound of approaching insect wings; by unfortunate coincidence, the sound of Superman's super-speed flying was similar enough to activate the spell. Lana was thus compelled to create a [[Chitin]]ous golden-brown costume (woven by [[silkworm]]s under her control) and adopt a villainous alter ego, the Insect Queen. After an initial clash with Superman, the Insect Queen fell under the mental influence of Superman's enemy, the [[Ultra-Humanite]], who kept her under the spell's compulsion and prevented her from reverting to normal. Earth-Two's Superman was able to locate an [[antidote]] to the spell, which Lois Lane used to remove the compulsion (''Superman Family'' #213, December 1981), letting Lana break free of Ultra's influence and making her able to use the amulet's power at her own discretion. The Earth-2 Insect Queen would later use her abilities to aid Superman in times of need. This version of Lana Lang phased out of existence during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

=== Modern version ===

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was written, various aspects of Lana's history were [[retcon]]ned, starting with comics writer [[John Byrne]]'s miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', which was designed to rewrite Superman's origin from scratch. In the post-Crisis version of events, Lana was a childhood friend of Clark, with a certain degree of romantic tension in the air as Lana had long pined after Clark, who had loved her only platonically in return.

After they graduated from high school Clark took Lana on a private walk, saying that he had to tell her something important, which Lana honestly expected to be a marriage proposal. He then divulged to her that he had superpowers, displayed by flying her around the world, before explaining that he felt he had to leave Smallville to help humanity as a whole. Kissing her goodbye "like a brother," Lana was left in considerable shock, not only over the revelation of Clark's superpowers, but also over the final realization that he held no reciprocal romantic feelings towards her, leaving Lana heartbroken and alone. When Lana finally aired her grievance with him years later, Clark felt very badly over how he had hurt her. 

When Clark appeared in public as Superman some years later, the lonely and depressed Lana deduced his true identity and became something of a stalker, to the extent that [[Lex Luthor]] noticed the frequency with which she appeared in the vicinity of the hero and actually had her tortured in an attempt to gain whatever inside knowledge of Superman she might have.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} However, Lana bravely kept Clark's identity a secret and upon his rescuing her their relationship became more healthy once again, albeit still at a distance. Unlike the pre-Crisis Earth-One continuity, Lana did not go on to have a journalistic career, compete with Lois for Superman's affections, nor play a significant role in Clark's life in Metropolis.

Lana's relationship with Clark is again altered in 2003's ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' [[limited series]] by [[Mark Waid]], which again revises Superman's origins.  This storyline, which takes some inspiration from the TV show "Smallville" (such as the appearance of Ma and Pa Kent), also shows Clark and Lana to have had a mutual romantic relationship during their youth.  At the start of the storyline, Lana has already left Smallville prior to Clark's return from his world journey.  Upon his arrival home, a disappointed Clark is told that Lana left some time prior and has not been heard from since.  Following this storyline, there is never again made mention of her past history regarding Clark or Superman.

Lana's "Birthright" history has been yet again re-made following the events of the Infinite Crisis, which has revived Clark's pre-crisis Superboy alter-ego.  In this new history, Lana had a deep romantic relationship with Clark, that was often interrupted by her two obnoxious brothers (which she lacked in previous versions).  The full extent of her history and her connection to Superboy/Clark has not yet been fully disclosed.  Again, her previous history has not been mentioned since this revision.

Years later, the post-Crisis Lana eventually married [[Pete Ross]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The two settled into a quiet life in Smallville, where they had a son they named after their mutual friend, Clark, after Lana asked Clark to save the baby's life when a car accident caused him to be born eight weeks premature; although Clark's efforts to take him to receive care were interrupted by the attack of the [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]-controlled [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Brainiac's subsequent attempts to use the baby's DNA to create a new body for himself brought the baby to full term.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Pete began a career in politics that got him elected to the [[United States Senate]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} In 2000, Senator Ross became Lex Luthor's [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] running mate in Luthor's bid to become [[President of the United States]], and after the two won, Lana moved to [[Washington, D.C.]]{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Eventually, Luthor was forced from his office, and Pete Ross became president (and Lana the [[First Lady of the United States]]){{Issue|date=April 2009}}. As she and Pete began to drift apart, Lana began to subtly attempt to regain Clark's affections, much to the anger of his (now) wife Lois Lane{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. Pete and Lana briefly reunited after Superman saved them from being killed by the villainous [[Ruin (comics)|Ruin]] in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]{{Issue|date=April 2009}}.
 
In ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #654, [[Perry White]] reported that Lana had become [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Lexcorp]] following the ousting of founder Lex Luthor. In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #49, it is revealed that she sold [[Kryptonite]] to the government to prevent Lexcorp from going under, and had caches of Kryptonite placed all over the planet, as a last-ditch defense if Superman should ever go rogue. When Superman and Batman come to remove the Kryptonite, Lana refuses to hand it over, and pushes a button which turns the caches into "[[dirty bomb]]s" which spread Kryptonite molecules through the entire planet, forcing all [[Kryptonian]]s to vacate. However, [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Toyman]] uses special [[nanobot]]s to remove all of the Kryptonite molecules, undoing the damage. Superman meets with Lana again, with Lana telling him she was left with no choice. Superman responds by telling her that, while he does sometimes wonder what things would have been like if he had married her rather than Lois, there is a reason he is with Lois instead of her: Lois would never have pushed the button. After Superman flies off, someone is shown watching Lana crying on a screen, saying to her "you did perfect".

She later tries to help Superman, facing the time-traveling strongman [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]], by sending the Luthor Squad. This act activates a dormant program inside the Lexcorp mainframes, an holographic version of Luthor. The holographic copy of Luthor informs Lana that by helping Superman she has violated the Lexcorp standard contract of employment, that forbids Lexcorp employers to use Lexcorp resources for helping Kryptonians, under the penalty of termination. So, Lana Lang is instantly fired, given a short amount of time to leave Lexcorp for good.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

New ''[[Supergirl]]'' writer [[Sterling Gates]] tells [[Newsarama]] "We're integrating Supergirl's book more into the Superman universe, and that includes having a supporting cast that overlaps with that world. I'm very interested in tying her back in to Metropolis and making sure that her world is a part of the Superman universe. [[Cat Grant]] will be a regular supporting cast member, as will Lana Lang."<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080627-WWCSupergirlteam.html Newsarama.Com : Wwc-Gates And Igle Named As Supergirl Team<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Lana takes it upon herself to reach out to Supergirl. She offers her advice and friendship. Around the same time, [[Perry White]] has been actively pursuing Lana to take over the Business section of [[The Daily Planet]], a position which Lana was afraid to accept, following her bad experience with Lexcorp. Eventually, Lana and Supergirl decide together that Lana will accept the position, and that Supergirl will take on the secret identity of Linda Lang, niece of Lana Lang. Lana now lives in Metropolis with Supergirl, and is working as the editor of the Business section of The Daily Planet.

She briefly returns to Smallville to attend [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan Kent]]'s funeral. However, unable to muster enough resolve to patch up things with Clark, Lana leaves before giving him her condolences. <ref>''Superman: New Krypton'' (2008)</ref>

While attending a student journalism award ceremony with Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant, Lana suddenly collapses, with blood pouring out her nose.<ref>''Supergirl'' #40</ref>; on Supergirl #42 she receives a call from her doctor telling her that he has "bad news" for her.

Lana also appeared in the ''[[Superman (1988 TV series)|Superman]]'' [[1988 in television|1988]] [[Animated series|animated]] Saturday morning [[television series]] produced by [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and had a 13-episode run. It's also notable for being the first appearance of the Superman mythos following [[John Byrne]]'s major relaunch of the character from 1986. The final four minutes of each Superman episode were devoted to a brief snapshot from the "Superman Family Album." These biographical segments deviated from the contemporary comics to have Clark have his powers fully developed since infancy as opposed to developing as he matured. These stories depicted the [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] misadventures of the young [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] immigrant as he faces typical childhood trials with his first day at school, an overnight scouting campout, getting a driver's license, his first date, and more. Lana was featured in some of these "Superman Family Album" flashback segments, but never appeared during the regular episode story segment.

===''Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman''===
Lana made one appearance in ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', where she was played by [[Emily Procter]] (best known as [[Calleigh Duquesne]] in TV's ''[[CSI: Miami]]'').

When the mainstream universe's Lois persuaded that world's Clark to become Superman, Lana ended their relationship.

===''Superman: The Animated Series''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:stas-lana.jpg|200px|thumb|Lana as she appears in Bruce Timm's [[Superman: The Animated Series]] and [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]] {{ffdc|Stas-lana.jpg|9 May 28}}]] -->
The pilot episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' followed the "post-Crisis" comics, with Lana being the first person Clark confided in about his superpowers. She mentioned she had a crush on him since the age of three. Lana, as an adult, appeared in later episodes as a world-famous fashion designer and still retained romantic feelings for her old friend (it is mentioned that they used to date).<br>Adult Lana first appears in "[[My Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)|My Girl]]," already having deduced Superman's identity, when her relationship with Lex Luthor breaks off after she tries to pass information on to Clark about Luthor's plots. She later plays a prominent role in "Obsession" and a cameo in the ending of the episode "The Late Mr. Kent", providing a cover story for Clark's reappearance. The young Lana was voiced by [[Kelley Schmidt]], and the adult version by [[Joely Fisher]].

===''Justice League''===

Lana appears in a cameo in the episode "Hereafter", at Superman's funeral. She also makes an appearance (as a combination of Lois and Lana) as Superman's wife in the dream induced by [[Mongul]] in "For The Man Who Has Everything", under the name of Loana-El. In this dreamworld, they both live on Krypton, along with [[Jor-El]], and have a son named Van-El.

=== ''Smallville'' ===
{{main|Lana Lang (Smallville)}}

In the 2000s television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', Lana, played by [[Kristin Kreuk]], is again the love interest of the young [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]. In a marked contrast to the redhead Lana Lang who appears in the Superman comic books, Kreuk is a brunette with an olive complexion. Lana is said to be descended on her mother's side from a French [[witchcraft|witch]], Countess Marguerite Isobel Theroux, whose vengeful spirit returns to possess her in a a story line taking up much of season 4.

In ''Smallville'', Lana and Clark's relationship is depicted (at least initially) as the complete reverse of the post-Crisis version, whereby it was "Clark who long pined over Lana without the other really knowing." This initial scenario also incorporated elements of the 1978 movie continuity by introducing the character of [[Whitney Fordman]], Lana's quarterback boyfriend and Clark's antagonist at the beginning of the series.  However ''Smallville'' caused controversy in season 8 by giving Lana superpowers which equally matched that of Clark.  Both Clark and Lana worked together to save people but it takes a twist when one of Lana's powers involved having the ability to drain power from kryptonite which weakened Clark when he got close to her.  Towards the end Lana leaves Clark to go on her own quest as she can no longer go near Clark due to the amount of kryptonite in her body.
