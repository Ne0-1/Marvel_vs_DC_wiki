'''Lana Lang''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in the [[Superman]] stories published by [[DC Comics]]. Lana's first appearance was in 1950 in ''[[Superboy]]'' #10. Her traditional role in the comics was as Superman's romantic interest when they were [[teenager|teenagers]], and as good friends when they became [[adult|adults]], especially once [[Lois Lane]] entered the picture. In the modern comics, she was married for a time to [[Pete Ross]], Clark Kent's best friend as a youth.  She is traditionally depicted with curly red-hair.

Lana is one of several Superman characters with the initials "LL", including [[Lex Luthor]], Lionel Luthor, Lois Lane, [[Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter|Letitia Lerner]] and [[Lori Lemaris]] the [[mermaid]].

==Original version==
In the original Superboy stories, Lana was the girl who lived next door to the Kent family in [[Smallville]], and was a romantic interest of [[Superboy]]. In the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] stories, Lana often behaved like a younger version of Lois, spending much of her time trying to prove that Superboy and Clark Kent were one and the same.

At one point, Lana once rescued an insect-like [[Extraterrestrial life | alien]] trapped by a fallen tree in Smallville.  In gratitude, the alien gave her a "bio-genetic" ring which allowed Lana to gain insect (and insect-like, such as [[arthropod]]s) characteristics. Lana created a yellow [[honeybee]]-like costume and mask, and took the name "Insect Queen", under which identity Lana had several adventures.

Lana also had various adventures with Superboy, and several with the futuristic superhero team the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Also appearing in some Silver Age stories was Lana's uncle, [[Professor Potter]], an eccentric inventor who had inadvertently created the first [[Bizarro]].

After Clark and Lana graduated from [[high school]], Lana went to college, and eventually became a [[television]] reporter; as an adult, she became a rival to Lois Lane for Superman's romantic affection in various 1960s stories, often appearing in the title ''Superman's Girlfriend, Lois Lane''.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, Lana became an anchorperson for WGBS-TV's evening news in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], as a co-anchor to Clark Kent. Her attraction to Superman during this time had also died off, leaving Superman to Lois. Lana later became romantically linked to the alien super-hero [[Vartox]].

In the early 1980s, with the use of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system DC had in place, Lana Lang was also shown in one story to have had an "Earth-Two" counterpart (Earth-Two at the time the home of the [[Justice Society of America]] and DC's [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] versions of its characters, versus its mainstream universe of "Earth-One"). In this story, Lana wound up becoming an Insect Queen like her Earth-One counterpart; in this case, Lana had received a mystic amulet from her archaeologist father, said amulet having been created to allow a [[Pharaoh]] to control and divert the [[locust]] hordes that threatened ancient [[Egypt]]. Unfortunately, the charm associated with the amulet was set to be energized by the sound of approaching insect wings; the next time an insect flew by, Lana was compelled to create a [[chitinous]] golden-brown costume (woven by [[silkworms]] under her control) and adopt a villainous alter ego, the Insect Queen. Earth-Two's Superman was able to locate an [[antidote]] to the spell, which Lois Lane used to remove the compulsion. (''Superman Family'' #213, 1981)

In [[Frank Miller]]'s classic graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Lana is the [[Daily Planet]]'s managing editor. A no-nonsense middle-aged lady, she is [[Batman]]'s most outspoken supporter, appearing in a series of TV debates in which she and others argue over his methods and influence.

==Modern version==
After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was written, various aspects of Lana's history were [[retcon]]ned, starting with comics writer [[John Byrne]]'s miniseries ''[[Man of Steel]]'', which was designed to rewrite Superman's origin from scratch. In the "post-Crisis" version of events, Lana was a childhood friend of Clark, with a certain degree of romantic tension in the air; after they graduated from high school, Clark divulged to her before leaving Smallville that he had superpowers, displayed by flying her around the world, which knowledge Lana kept secret. Years later, Lana eventually married Pete Ross, and the two settled into a quiet life in Smallville, with Lana eventually giving birth to their son, whom she named "Clark." 

In 2000, Pete Ross became [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[vice president|vice presidential]] running mate in Luthor's bid to become [[president of the United States]], and after the two won, Lana moved to [[Washington, D.C.]]. Eventually, Luthor was forced from his office, and Pete Ross became president (and Lana the [[First Lady]]). Recently, Lana and Pete [[divorced]].

==Other media==
In the failed 1961 TV pilot "The Adventures of Superboy", Lana Lang made her first live-action appearance, portrayed by [[Bunny Henning]], alongside [[Johnny Rockwell]] as Superboy.

In 1966, Lana appeared in the Superboy segments of the animated series "The New Adventures of Superman". She was voiced by [[Janet Waldo]]. 

In Richard Donner's [[Superman: The Movie]] in 1978, Lana Lang had a brief appearance in a scene at Smallville High. She was shown to be a cheerleader at the school with a fairly obvious crush on Clark, even though her current boyfriend was a football player named Brad. She was portrayed by Diane Sherry. 

In the 1983 movie ''[[Superman III]]'' Lana was played by [[Annette O'Toole]] (who went on to play [[Martha Kent]] in ''[[Smallville (television series)|Smallville]]''). In this film, she is a divorcee with a son named Ricky. A security guard vying for her attention is a former [[jock]] and Clark's childhood [[bully]] (possibly inspiring the character Whitney in ''Smallville'').

In the late 1980s [[Superboy (TV series)|"Superboy" TV series]], Lana was played by [[Stacy Haiduk]]. In this version, she was a lifelong friend of Clark, who accompanied him to Shuster University (named after Superman's co-creator) and later the Bureau for Extra-Normal Matters, where she and Clark investigated all of the unusual incidents that took place in Capitol City, Florida.

Lana made one appearance in ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', where she was played by [[Emily Procter]]. Lana's appearance was in an episode set in an [[alternate universe]], where she was engaged to Clark, and encouraged him to keep his abilities secret. When the mainstream universe's Lois persuaded that world's Clark to become Superman, Lana ended their relationship.

The pilot episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' followed the "post-Crisis" comics, with Lana being the first person Clark confided in about his superpowers. Lana, as an adult, appeared in later episodes as a world-famous fashion designer. The young Lana was voiced by [[Kelley Schmidt]], and the adult version by [[Joely Fisher]].

In the 2000s television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', Lana, played by [[Kristin Kreuk]], is again the (often forbidden) love interest of the young [[Clark Kent]], with at least some of each episode devoted to their potentially developing relationship. Kreuk has long, dark hair and is part-Chinese, part-[[Netherlands|Dutch]]. In this show, this characteristic is explained by saying that Lana is Native American on her father's side, unlike the previous depictions of Lana. Lana's historical ancestry on her maternal side included a French [[witch]] whose vengeful spirit later returned to possess her (named Countess Margaret Isabelle Theroux).
