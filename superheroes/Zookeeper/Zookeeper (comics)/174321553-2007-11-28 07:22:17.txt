'''Zookeeper''' is a fictional character from the ''[[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' comics.

==History==
'''Dr. Samuel Register''' worked with Mark and Marie Logan in Africa. He despised their rambuncious son, [[Beast Boy|Garfield]], who constantly caused damage in his lab. He was (and still is) obsessed with people calling him "Dr. Register" and nothing else.

After Logan's parents successfully cured Garfield of Sakutia, Register went on to try and finish their work. He became mad for results and inhumanly slaughtered animals in mutations. This erned him the nickname "Zookeeper".

In the "Beast Boys and Girls" storyline, Register stole a sample of Sakutia to try and mutate it like Garfield's parents did. He accidentally infected himself and every kid in [[San Francisco]]. When Beast Boy was infected, the virus in him was canceled out and he was cured.

Zookeeper injected venom from the [[Australian venomous funnel-web spider|Sydney funnel-web spider]] into Garfield and attempted to dissect and extract the cure to Sakutia from him. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and the other [[Titans (comics)|Titans]] kept Register busy while [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] healed Beast Boy. Wanting to stop Zookeeper desperately, Garfield reinfected himself with Sakutia. His powers back to speed, Beast Boy fought and defeated Zookeeper. He also found a way to cure the kids that were infected. Apparently, Register is immune to Sakutia, like Beast Boy. [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] broke him out of prison during ''[[Villains United]] [[Infinite Crisis]] Special''.

==Powers and abilities==
Zookeeper can turn into any animal at will, just like Beast Boy. However, his side effects are different from Garfield's. His skin is purple and scaly, and his eyes and hair didn't change color with his skin.

==Trivia==
Named after [[Sam Register]], co-producer of ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]''.

In the [[Futurama]] episode [[Less Than Hero]], a villain also named "Zookeeper" appears, though this Zoo keeper is actually a parody of villains from the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] series.
