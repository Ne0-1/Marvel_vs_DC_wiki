'''Michael "Mike" Van Patrick''' was the [[fictional character|fictional]] great-grandson of [[Abraham Erskine|Dr. Abraham Erskine]], the inventor of the [[super soldier serum]] within the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. Van Patrick first appeared in [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1 and was subsequently killed off at the end of that issue.

However, Van Patrick remained a main character within The Initiative series as he was cloned several times after his death; once to replace the dead Van Patrick, this clone was returned to the Van Patrick's home so that Michael's parents would never know, and three more times (under the names Michael, Van, and Patrick) to work as a [[Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|Black Ops group within The Initiative]], the [[Scarlet Spider]]s. The Scarlet Spiders were only revealed to be clones in Avengers: The Initiative #7

==Michael Van Patrick==
After Dr. Abraham Erskine died, he left years of research and findings which the government didn't think were worth bothering with or even classifying a secret, to his grandson, Mr. Van Patrick. Mr. Van Patrick used the research on how to grow, prepare and serve the healthiest, most wholesome foods and the outline of an experimental program of isometric exercises which were developed to challenge the human body like never before in the early life and development of his son, Michael.<ref name="Initannul#1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]], [[Christos Gage]] | Penciller =  [[Tom Feister]], [[Carmine Di Giandomenico]] | Inker = [[Jose Villarrubia]] | Story = Born To Serve | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] Annual | Issue = 1 | Date = December 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> 

After the events of the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], all United States superpowered individuals were required to register with the government; with some younger individuals being referred to The Initiative training camp, [[Camp Hammond]]. After it was revealed that Michael Van Patrick's great-grand farther created the super soldier serum, many people suspected his athletic ability for a superpower. The subsequent scandal resulted in Van Patrick losing his [[scholarship]]  but convinced [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], an Initiative superhero, to recruit Van Patrick for the program and train him to become a superhero.<ref name="AvengInit#1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Happy Accidents | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 1 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> 

Michael Van Patrick joined the program and took up the name '''MVP'''. During his first day at Camp Hammond, MVP demonstrated above average speed and agility as he broke the camps obstacle course record for non-super speed users on his first try. Later in the day during a combat simulator exercise, MVP is forced to save fellow recruit [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] when an out-of-control trainee, [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], fires blindly at the other recruits. While saving Cloud 9, MVP takes a direct hit, the head shot instantly kills MVP.<ref name="AvengInit#1"/>

After MVP's accidental death, Initiative scientist Dr. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]], who originally worked on the [[Nazi]] equivalent of the super soldier serum, performed the autopsy on Michael's body revealing that MVP's perfect physical abilities were unconnected to the super-soldier serum, and were instead achieved by purely natural means. Von Blitzschlag advocated cloning MVP, much to chief administrator [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s disapproval.<ref name="AvengInit#2">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Hero Moment | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 2 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> 

===Michael Van Patrick clone===
Thought Pym disapproved the idea of cloning MVP, Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces [[Henry Gyrich]], who had ordered MVP's death remain secret, sanctioned the cloning. As Van Patrick had no superpowers the cloning of him was relatively easy for Von Blitzschlag, and, with help from the [[photographic reflexes]] of [[Taskmaster]] in a suit covered in telemetry circuits and some video of MVP's training session, all of Van Patrick's skills and athletic ability was programmed into the clone.<ref name="Initannul#1"/>

The fully grown (to the age of Van Patrick) clone was then sent home to his family's [[Organic farming|organic]] [[vegetable]] farm in [[Liberty, Kentucky]], under the cover story that Michael Van Patrick had washed out of the Initiative program because he had no powers. The clone, still coming to the realization that his memories are not his own and that he will never be the real Michael Van Patrick, elects to stay with "his" family but is warned never to tell them that he is only a clone of their real son.<ref name="Initannul#1"/>

Not knowing this, Justice and Cloud 9 fly to the Van Patrick farm to tell MVP's parents the news of his death. However, when they get to the door the Michael Van Patrick clone greets them and before they could ask how MVP could be here alive and well, the two are called off to deal with the events of [[World War Hulk]].<ref name="AvengInit#4">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Green Zone | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 4 | Date = September 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> Justice, getting tired of being kept out of the loop regarding MVP by Gyrich and Pym, once again takes Cloud 9 with him to [[Kentucky]] only to find Van Patrick's farm house boarded up and abandoned.<ref name="AvengInit#7">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Triple Treat | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 7 | Date = December 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

The current where abouts of the Michael Van Patrick clone, and the rest of the Van Patrick family, is unknown.

===Michael, Van, and Patrick===
Three more clones, developed the same time as the first, were programmed via input from Taskmaster with not only MVP's move set but with the move set of [[Spider-Man]], Peter Parker.<ref name="Initannul#1"/> This made the three clones ('''Michael''', '''Van''', and '''"Pat" Patrick''') perfect candidates to use redesigned [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|''Iron Spider'' Stark armor]] which Spider-Man formerly wore during the early events of the superhero Civil War. 

During their first appearance, they identify themselves as "Red Team" and take down supervillians [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], and [[Hydro-Man]]. Though [[War Machine]] identifies them by their official name the '''Scarlet Spiders''' when contacting them,<ref name="AvengInit#3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Bug Hunt | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 3 | Date = August 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> the Scarlet Spider still identify themselves as ''Red Team One'' (Michael), ''Red Team Two'' (Van), and ''Red Team Three'' ("Pat" Patrick) while in the field.<ref name="AvengInit#7"/> The Scarlet Spiders are later revealed to be part of a [[black ops]] group with [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Mutant Zero]], [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]] and [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]] called the ''Shadow Initiative'' under the command of Henry Gyrich.<ref name="AvengInit#5">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Secret Weapons | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 5 | Date = October 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

After an attack on Baron Von Blitzschlag, the Scarlet Spiders, who treat their creator Von Blitzschlag like a father were forced to expose themselves to the public during their pursuit of three criminals wearing the [[Vulture (comics)#Vulturions|Vulturions]] flying exosuits, as well as deal with an angered Peter Parker; their appearance in battle against and alongside Parker has raised public doubt over whether Parker is the original and/or only Spider-Man, despite publicly revealing his dual identity in the early events of the Civil War,<ref name="AvengInit#7"/> the long term effects of this, however, are now seemingly moot, due to the events of "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]".<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[J.

==Abilities and equipment==
Like [[Captain America]], MVP is intelligent, strong, fast, agile, and durable as it is possible for a human being to be without being considered superhuman. However unlike Captain America, it was revealed that this was not due to any quick fix measure, like the super-soldier serum, Van Patrick became the optimum specimen of human development and conditioning through what is described as a "revolutionary" diet and an "ultimate" exercise regime.

The First clones boasts the same abilities as the original. However, Michael, Van, and Patrick possess these same skills as well as the move set (to the best of a non-superhuman ability) of Spider-Man (Peter Parker).

Michael, Van, and Patrick's Scarlet Spider suits, a redesign of [[Tony Stark]]'s [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|''Iron Spider'' armor]] (previously used by Spider-Man), is supported by systems similar to that of Stark's classic [[Iron Man]] design, it features many gadgets, including four (one more than the original) mechanical spider-arms, or "[[Remote manipulator|waldoes]]," on each suit that can be used to see around corners (via cameras in the tips) and to manipulate objects indirectly.

Other features the suits contain include short-distance gliding capability, limited bulletproofing, built-in [[fire department|fire]]/[[police]]/emergency scanner, audio/visual amplification (including [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]), [[stealth technology|cloaking]] device, carbon filters to keep out airborne [[toxin]]s, the ability to breathe under water, and a short-range [[GPS]] microwave communication system. The suits are also able to make themselves look like other styles of costumes previously worn by Spider-Man and into street clothes. 

Other abilities of the suits, found in Spider-Man's version, have yet to be seen used by the Scarlet Spiders.
