The first clone replaced Michael, and was sent back to his parent's home to prevent them from learning of his death. The next three clones, named Michael, Van, and Patrick, originally worked as the [[Scarlet Spider]]s, as part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|Black Ops group within The Initiative]]. They were revealed to be clones in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7. He was cloned once more, in the ''Killed in Action'' story arc when plans were made to fill some of the vacant positions in the Initiative teams with MVP clones.

The original Michael Van Patrick, and his first clone, have yet to appear outside the pages of ''Avengers: The Initiative''. All that is known about the original character has been revealed throughout the ongoing series, with Van Patrick's (and the first sets of clones) origins being shown in the 2007 ''Avengers: The Initiative Annual''. However, the Scarlet Spiders (Micheal and Patrick) became the first clones to appear outside ''The Initiative'' when they appeared in ''[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]'' vol. 4 #14 (August 2008), with the first MVP clone appearing in the following issue of the New Warriors series.

==Michael Van Patrick==
Michael Van Patrick's origins are traced back to the developer of the [[Supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] serum, that changed a frail Steve Rogers into [[Timely Comics]]'s<ref>The 1995 ''Marvel Milestone Edition: Captain America'' archival reprint has no cover date or number, and its postal indicia says "Originally published ... as Captain America #000". Timely's first comic ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1, likewise had no number on its cover, and was released with two different cover dates.</ref> (Marvel Comics' 1940s predecessor's) [[Captain America]], scientist "Dr. Josef Reinstein,"<ref>''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941)</ref><ref>''Captain America'' #109 (Jan. 1969)</ref> later [[retcon|retroactively changed]] to a code name for the scientist Abraham Erskine.<ref name="stern origin">''Captain America'' #255 (March 1981)</ref> On his death, Dr. Erskine left papers, which covered years of research and findings that the government had not seen fit to classify, to his grandson, Brian Van Patrick<ref name="AvengInit#11">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N. Gage]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Killed In Action part 4: Worst Case Scenario | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 11 | Date = May 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>, who studied his grandfather's work, particularly regarding his work on growing, preparing and serving the most wholesome and nutritional foods, and an exceptionally challenging experimental program of [[isometric exercise]]s he developed. Brian Van Patrick used the research during the early life and development of his son, Michael, helping him achieve his optimum potential.<ref name="Initannul#1"/> 

The events of the 2006-2007 Marvel Comics [[fictional crossover|crossover]], [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], required all United States [[Superpower (ability)|superpowered]] individuals to register with the American government. Some of these individuals were sent to The Initiative's training camp, [[Camp Hammond]]. Given Michael Van Patrick's descent from the creator of the super soldier serum, many people came to suspect his athletic abilities to be superpower-related with a subsequent scandal resulting in Michael losing his [[scholarship]] and [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], an Initiative superhero, recruiting Michael for the Initiative program to train him into a superhero.<ref name="AvengInit#1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Happy Accidents | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 1 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> 

[[Image:Mvpdies.jpg|thumb|180px|left|MVP is killed after saving [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1. Art by Stefano Caselli.]]
Michael Van Patrick joined the program, under the codename '''MVP''', along with a selection of old and new characters to make up the cast of the ''Avengers: The Initiative''. During the first day's training at Camp Hammond, MVP demonstrated extraordinary speed and agility as he broke the camp's [[obstacle course]] record for users without [[superspeed]] on his first attempt.<ref name="AvengInit#1"/>

During a combat simulator exercise, one of the Initiative trainees, [[Armory (comics)|Armory]] goes out of control and fires blindly on the other recruits, and MVP has to save a fellow recruit [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]]. While saving Cloud 9, MVP is shot in the head, killing him instantly.<ref name="AvengInit#1"/>

Initiative scientist Dr. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]], a former [[Nazi]] and [[supervillain]], performed the [[autopsy]] on Michael's body. The autopsy revealed that MVP's extraordinary physical abilities were unconnected to the super-soldier serum, and were instead achieved by purely natural means. Von Blitzschlag advocated cloning MVP, much to chief administrator [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]]'s disapproval.<ref name="AvengInit#2">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Hero Moment | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 2 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

===First clone===
Though Yellowjacket disapproved the idea of cloning MVP, Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces [[Henry Gyrich]], who had ordered MVP's death remain secret, sanctioned the cloning. As Van Patrick is a non-altered human, Yellowjacket considered the cloning was comparatively easy.<ref name="Initannul#1"/>  

''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1 reveals the clones creation and development. As the clone was grown to its original's age, all of his original's skills and abilities programmed into him with the help of a special suit with telemetry circuits and a video of MVP's training session and the [[photographic reflexes]] of [[Taskmaster]]. The first clone is sent home to his family's [[Organic farming|organic]] [[vegetable]] farm in [[Liberty, Kentucky]], with a false story that he had failed the Initiative program because of his lack of powers. The clone, who was still coming to realize that his memories are not his own and that he will never be the real Michael Van Patrick, elects to stay with "his" family. He is warned however to never tell them that he is not their real son. 

However, the clone's first appearance was a couple of months prior in a few panels of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4, where Justice and Cloud 9, not knowing of clone's replacing Michael, flew to the Van Patrick farm to inform MVP's parents of his death. On arriving, they are greeted at the door by the clone but are called off to deal with the events of [[World War Hulk]]<ref name="AvengInit#4">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Green Zone | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 4 | Date = September 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> before they can ask how it is Michael is alive and well. In a later issue, Justice again returns with Cloud 9 to the Van Patrick home, wishing to find out what information Gyrich and Yellowjacket were keeping from him. On arriving, they find the house boarded up and abandoned.<ref name="AvengInit#7">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Triple Treat | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 7 | Date = December 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> 

During the ''[[Avengers: The Initiative#Killed in Action|Killed In Action]]'' storyline, it is revealed that the clone has an imbedded tracking device and that the Van Patrick family had moved to [[Bulls Gap, Tennessee]]<ref name="AvengInit#10">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N. Gage]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Killed In Action part 3: Confirmed Kills | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 10 | Date = May 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>. In the conclusion of this storyline, the clone then helps The Initiative stop KIA, and begins to further MVP's romantic interest in Cloud 9<ref name="AvengInit#11"/>. In ''Avengers: The Initiative #12'', the MVP clone, along with the surviving Scarlet Spiders and MVP's father, join with [[New Warriors#Counter-Initiative team|Justice's New Warriors]] as a ''Counter Initiative'' of underground registered heroes. MVP, as apart of ''[[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]]'', would go on to appear in ''[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]'' vol. 4 #14 and #15 (September & October 2008); in the character's first appearance outside of an Avengers: The Initiative title.

===Scarlet Spiders===
[[Image:Scarlet Spiders.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover art for ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7. Art by [[Stefano Caselli]].]]
Three more clones, developed the same time as the first but with added genetic material from Baron Von Blitzschlage<ref name="AvengInit#10"/>, were programmed via input from Taskmaster with not only MVP's skills and abilities but also those of [[Spider-Man]], Peter Parker.<ref name="Initannul#1"/> The three clones, '''Michael''', '''Van''', and '''Patrick''' (sometimes referred to as "'''Pat'''"), were each suited up in redesigned [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|''Iron Spider'' Stark armor]] which Spider-Man had worn during the early stages of the superhero Civil War.<ref name="ironspider">{{cite web|title=Initiative Initiation: The Scarlet Spiders|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1706.Initiative_Initiation:_The_Scarlet_Spiders|publisher=[[Marvel.com]]|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=2008-01-11|quote=A triumvirate of enigmas clad in versions of the armor developed by Tony Stark for Spider-Man during "Civil War," the Scarlet Spiders made their first appearance in AVENGERS: THE INITIATIVE #3}}</ref>

During their first appearance, they identify themselves as "Red Team" and take down supervillains [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], and [[Hydro-Man]]. Though [[War Machine]] identifies them by their official name '''Scarlet Spiders''' when contacting them,<ref name="AvengInit#3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Bug Hunt | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 3 | Date = August 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> they still identify themselves as ''Red Team One'' (Michael), ''Red Team Two'' (Van), and ''Red Team Three'' ("Pat" Patrick) in the field.<ref name="AvengInit#7"/> They are later revealed to be part of a [[black ops]] group called the ''Shadow Initiative'' under the command of Henry Gyrich with [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Mutant Zero]], [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]] and [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]].<ref name="AvengInit#5">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller =  [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Secret Weapons | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 5 | Date = October 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

The Scarlet Spiders were forced to expose themselves to the public in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7 after an attack on Baron Von Blitzschlage. The subsequent pursuit of three criminals wearing the [[Vulture (comics)#Vulturions|Vulturions]] flying exosuits would lead the spiders into confronting an angry Peter Parker. Their appearance in battle against and alongside Parker has raised public doubts over whether Parker is the original and/or only Spider-Man, despite his having publicly revealing his dual identity in the early events of the Civil War.<ref name="AvengInit#7"/>

Now public, the Scarlet Spiders join with the other initiative trainees in the next issue. An incident involving [[Dragon Man]] leads one of the Spiders to save Cloud 9 in much the same fashion as the original MVP did at the time of his death.<ref name="AvengInit#8">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N. Gage]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Killed In Action | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 8 | Date = December 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> In ''Avengers: The Initiative #10'', the Scarlet Spiders unmask themselves in an attempt to calm the enraged MVP clone, KIA, only to have him behead one of their number. The surviving (and still unmasked) Scarlet Spiders, Michael and Patrick<ref name="AvengInit#11"/>, are later seen by the majority of the trainees, including Cloud 9. <ref>{{cite web|title= AVENGERS: THE INITIATIVE 10|url=http://www.marvelonline.com/catalog/?id=8291|publisher=[[Marvel.com]]|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=2008-01-11|quote=For some time you've known the secret of the SCARLET SPIDERS. Now here's what happens when CLOUD 9 finds out!}}</ref> In ''Avengers: The Initiative #11'', the remaining Scarlet Spiders make there way to Bulls Gap, Tennessee to aid in the capture of KIA. 

In ''Avengers: The Initiative #12'' after the defeat of KIA, the surviving Scarlet Spiders, along with the MVP clone and the real MVP's father, join with Justice's New Warriors as a [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Initiative/Counter Force]] of underground registered heroes who go on to appear in ''[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]'' [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in story "Secrets and [[Skrull]]s" where Counter Force would team up with the other team of New Warriors.

===KIA===
[[Image:KIA.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Cover art for ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #11. Art by [[Steve Uy]].]]
The results of the previous clonings impressed Initiative administrators enough to attempt to fill places within the Fifty-State Initiative with further clones of MVP.<ref name="AvengInit#8"/> In ''Avengers: The Initiative'''s first, and currently ongoing, multi-part story; ''Killed in Action'' (starting issue #8), a new Michael Van Patrick clone is fitted with the Tactigon, [[Armory (comics)|Armory's]] former alien weapon and sets forth on a murderous rampage through Camp Hammond in an attempt to seek revenge for MVP's death. 

In the second part, ''First Casualties'', the clone, who is distinguished by his whited out eyes, is said to have had Armory's moves programmed into him in preparation to use the Omega-Level weapon that killed the original MVP. The Tactigon interfaces with this clone's mind activating latent memories of the real MVP's death. Hacking into the Initiative's computer, the clone learns of his "death" and gains a list of all those present at the time. The disturbed clone demolishes the cloning lab, attacking Baron Von Blitzschlag while saying the term Killed in Action over and over again and carving the initials "KIA" into his chest. The clone continues its rampage through Camp Hammond, striking heavily those whose names are on his list and attacking anyone else who gets in the way. 

At the end of the second part, the clone attempts to find the [[comatose]] [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]], the [[drill instructor]] who sent MVP to the ill-fated combat training session. However, Gauntlet's weapon, taken from an alien that faced off against the Alien who controlled the Tactigon in Gauntlet and Armory's [[origin story|origin stories]]<ref name="Initannul#1"/>, seemingly takes control of Gauntlet's body forcing him to acquire the sword element of his alien's armor which recovered when he originally bonded with the alien glove device. The two later battle and KIA brings Gauntlet out of his coma, in a effort to face the man rather than the gauntlet weapon.<ref name="AvengInit#10"/>

In the concluding part of this storyline, ''Worst Case Scenario'', KIA battles his way through the Initiative to follow trainees Cloud 9, [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] to the location of MVP's first clone, Bulls Gap, Tennessee, where they are attempting to convince the first clone to download its memories into a device (and most likely leave himself [[braindead]]) which could then upload them into KIA to reset his mind. After arriving at the location, KIA is met by the collective Initiative force of [[Mighty Avengers|The Avengers]], the remaining Scarlet Spiders, a rogue [[New Warriors#Initiative Team|New Warriors]] group and the trainees. In the climax of the battle, the first clone used the device to download KIA memories leaving his body brain-dead. After the battle [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] is seen taking the device which reads "''ready to transmit brain patters to new host body''" leaving KIA's eventual fate [[open-ended]].

Many trainees and staff members were injured during KIA's rampage with only [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]]<ref name="AvengInit#12">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] & [[Christos N. Gage]] | Penciller = [[Steve Yu]] | Inker = | Story = Changing  Of The Guard | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 12 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>, [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]]<ref name="AvengInit#12"/>, Van<ref name="AvengInit#11"/> (one of the Scarlet Spiders<ref name="AvengInit#12"/>) and 8 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents<ref name="AvengInit#12"/> being killed. However in ''Avengers: The Initiative #12'', Trauma would come back to life.

==Abilities and equipment==
In ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2, Dr. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] refers to Michael Van Patrick as an "[[Übermensch]]", a perfect human specimen, down to the [[cellular]] level. This perfection is displayed in his mental and physical abilities being the highest possible standard for a human being to be without being considered superhuman, much like [[Captain America]]. [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], one of the chief administrators at Camp Hammond, ironically referred to MVP as "Captain America, Jr."<ref>{{cite web|title=‘THE INITIATIVE’ UPDATE: APRIL 4, 2007. By Kevin Mahadeo, Matt Powell and Brian Warmoth|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004166632.cfm|publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]|date=4 April 2007|accessdate=2008-01-21|quote=Ironically dubbed Captain America Jr. by Yellowjacket, the star-athlete MVP would soon suffer the same fate as the Star-Spangled Avenger when he put heroism first to save a combat-frozen Cloud 9 from a wayward energy blast. And not even a half-second later, MVP took the next blast skull first!}}</ref> in the first issue of ''Avengers: The Initiative''. However, unlike Captain America, MVP's abilities were revealed in the ''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' to have come as a result of the "revolutionary" diet and an "ultimate" isometric exercise regime he went through rather than Dr. Erskine's super-soldier serum.

The first clone has those same abilities, with the Scarlet Spiders additionally having the skills, reflexes and moves of Spider-Man programmed into them to the degree of regular human ability.<ref name="Initannul#1"/>

Michael, Van, and Patrick's Scarlet Spider suits, a redesign of [[Tony Stark]]'s [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|''Iron Spider'' armor]] (previously used by Spider-Man),<ref name="ironspider"/> are supported by systems similar to that of Stark's classic [[Iron Man]] design. In the Scarlet Spider's first appearance, ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3, the suit is shown to feature several devices, including four mechanical spider-arms or "[[Remote manipulator|waldoes]]" on each suit, one more than on the original, along with [[stealth technology|cloaking]] devices, and a short-range [[GPS]] microwave communication system. In ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7, the suits are shown to have the new feature of mechanical [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Web-shooters|web-shooters]] and had retained the ability to change appearance to other versions of the Spider-Man costume or street clothes. In ''[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]'' vol. 4 #16 (September 2008), it was revealed the suits have had their StarkTech removed which prevented the suits being affected when all StarkTech was made inoperable by Skrull invaders.

Attached to the "KIA" Michael Van Patrick is [[Armory (comics)|Armory]]'s former weapon, known as ''Tactigon'', which was detached when she was expelled from the Initiative program.  It is a multi-dimensional alien device that is able shift into an infinite number of weapons and tools with a built in safety designed to give the wearer exactly what she or he needs to get the job done.<ref name="AvengInit#1"/>

Despite concerns over writer Dan Slott being too cavalier with killing MVP, IGN reviewer stated that "having seen the emotional fallout of that incident, I can see why it was so important to do that.
