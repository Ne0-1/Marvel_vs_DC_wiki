'''Subterranea''' is a fictional realm beneath the earth's surface in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Subterranea is a system of massive caves and tunnels, some large enough to hold cities, that are inhabited by the various races of '''Subterraneans'''. The first recorded entrance to Subterranea was found at [[Monster Island]].

==Subterraneans==
The '''Gortokians''' were the first race of Subterraneans. They were created by the [[Deviants (comics)|Deviants]] as a slave race centuries ago, but they rebelled. Eventually, the Gortokians died of disease, and the only known survivor is [[Grotesk]], who is best known for having apparently killed the [[X-Men]]'s leader, [[Professor X]] (but who was actually the shapeshifter [[Changeling (comics)|Changeling]]).

The '''Moloids''' (or "Mole People") were the next race to be created by the Deviants. The Moloids are the physically weakest of the Subterraneans, and consequently they almost always act in great numbers. Due to their physical and mental weakness, the Deviants rejected them, and attempted to exterminate them all. Today, they serve the [[Mole Man]], and have frequently fought the [[Fantastic Four]] alongside their master and his monsters. The '''Tyrannoids''' are an offshoot of the Moloids who serve the near-immortal surface-world exile [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]]. They are not quite as weak or simple-minded as their Moloid cousins. As pawns of Tyrannus, the Tyrannoids have fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] on several occasions.

The '''Lava Men''' are a race of Subterraneans who were mutated by the demon Cha'sa'dra, a native of [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]], into a lava-skinned form. The first Lava Man to visit the surface world was Jinku, who was propelled to the surface by a volcanic reaction triggered by the trickster god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. This Lava Man fought [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and he and other Lava Men later fought Thor's teammates, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Cha'sa'dra was among the demons of Limbo who appeared on Earth during the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" storyline, and when he was destroyed in combat with the Avengers, the Lava Men were apparently transformed into solid, non-living matter.
