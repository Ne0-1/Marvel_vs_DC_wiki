'''Foxfire''' was a fictional character from [[Marvel Comics]]' original [[Squadron Supreme]] series. Unlike most of the Squadron's villains, she does not seem to have a [[DC Comics]] counterpart.

Olivia Underwood, alias the [[supervillain]] Foxfire, was a member of the [[Institute of Evil]], a criminal organization opposed by the [[superhero]] team called the Squadron Supreme. This was complicated somewhat by the fact that Foxfire was in love with Squadron member [[Doctor Spectrum]]. However, he seemingly did not return her feelings.

When the Institute of Evil was captured by the Squadron and its members [[mind control]]led by the Behavior Modification device, Foxfire and the other former super-criminals became members of the Squadron, to assist them in their efforts to forcibly turn the world into a [[Utopia]]. However, the hero named [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk I|Nighthawk]] opposed the Squadron and formed a rebel group, the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]]. He undid the Behavior Modification of Foxfire and several others, and recruited them into his group.

During the final battle between the Redeemers and the Squadron, Foxfire, who was still in love with Doctor Spectrum, tried to gain his approval by betraying Nighthawk, thus allowing the Squadron to win the fight. She used her powers to kill Nighthawk by blasting his heart. Foxfire was then killed by fellow Redeemer [[Mink (comics)|Mink]], who had been in love with Nighthawk. The death of Nighthawk caused the Squadron members to realize that they had become the very thing that they had intended to oppose, and thus ended the fight, though not in the way that Foxfire had intended.

==Powers and Abilities==
Foxfire has the ability to [[Disintegration|disintegrate]] matter by breaking its [[molecular bonds]]. Her power manifests as a "glow" which she projects from her body, usually from her hands.
