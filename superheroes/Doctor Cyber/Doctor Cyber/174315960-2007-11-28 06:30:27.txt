'''Doctor Cyber''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. The character is a [[supervillain]] who fought [[Wonder Woman]] several times in stories taking place before the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. After the Crisis, another villainess with the same name emerged as a foe of the [[Power Company]].

==Character history==
===Pre-Crisis===
Doctor Cyber was the commanding presence behind a global criminal network around the same time when [[Wonder Woman]] had relinquished her powers when her fellow [[Amazons]] retreated into another dimension. Prior to Cyber's first encounter with the depowered Amazon, her henchmen plundered the [[monastery]] of [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]] for the gems and precious metals within and slaughtered the resisting [[monks]]. [[Colonel]] [[Steve Trevor]] unsuccessfully attempted to infiltrate Cyber's network, but learned of their plot: to create chaos within the [[US Government]] by sending [[bombs]] inside toys to the children of [[Congressmen]]. This plot was actually a ruse to divert attention from a [[London]] jewel heist, foiled by Wonder Woman and I Ching. Doctor Cyber escaped only to resurface in [[Hong Kong]] several weeks later. (''Wonder Woman'' #179-182 [November-December 1968—May-June 1969])

In Hong Kong, Doctor Cyber's plan was to destroy the city and [[blackmail]] the world with a series of devices that could create [[earthquakes]]. Cyber lured the non-powered Diana Prince to the Asian city hoping to entice her into joining the organization, which she steadfastly refused. Soon afterward, an attack by the rival Tiger Tong gang resulted in an urn of hot coals spilling onto Cyber's face. The villainess was evacuated to a secret [[hospital]] outside of Hong Kong, swearing revenge on Diana Prince for her disfigurement. Prince stopped the earthquake plot and Cyber was believed killed when her final earthquake device exploded. (''Wonder Woman'' #187-188 [March-April 1970—May-June 1970])

When Diana Prince (her powers since returned) teamed up with private detective [[Jonny Double]] to stop an organization called the Tribunal, she discovered that Doctor Cyber had survived their previous encounter. Cyber had created the Tribunal to find a suitable woman to transplant her [[brain]] and replace her disfigured body. After Prince's capture, Cyber unsuccessfully attempted to have her brain transplanted into Diana by [[Doctor Moon]]. During this encounter, Cyber was accidentally impaled by a [[scalpel]] and believed killed once again. (''Wonder Woman'' #200 [May-June 1972])

On an assignment at a [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill Mountain]] resort as Diana Prince, Wonder Woman again discovered that Doctor Cyber had cheated death. While investigating a number of murders at the resort, Cyber battled Wonder Woman after an unsuccessful attempt to graft the Amazon's face onto her own. The ensuing melée ended with Cyber seemingly falling to her death from atop a [[ski lift]]. (''Wonder Woman'' #221 [December 1975-January 1976])

Doctor Cyber laid low for several months before capturing [[Wonder Girl]] in another attempt to capture Wonder Woman for a brain transplant. Wonder Woman agreed to trade her life for her adopted sister, but both were rescued by the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Cyber and her partner, Dr. Moon, were finally captured. (''Wonder Woman'' #287 [January 1982])

It is unknown if Doctor Cyber was released or escaped from custody, but she disguised herself as Diana Prince, infiltrated the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], and stole the launch codes to America's [[Nuclear weapons delivery|nuclear missiles]]. Wonder Woman averted the attempted [[nuclear war]], but Cyber was killed attempting to flee from her and Steve Trevor (disguised as the god [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]]) when her rocket sled crashed into the side of a cliff. (''Wonder Woman'' #319-321 [September-November 1984])

During the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] assumedly retrieved Doctor Cyber sometime prior to her death and assigned her to team-up with several other villains to conquer [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-S|Earth-S]]. Doctor Cyber was finally excised from the [[DC Universe]] after the conclusion of Crisis.

===Post-Crisis===
The second Doctor Cyber first appeared, chronologically, in post-Crisis continuity in ''The [[Power Company]]'' #1 (April 2002). She is later shown re-introduced into the Wonder Woman comic by battling [[Donna Troy]] (the new Wonder Woman) and [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie Sandsmark]] (the current [[Wonder Girl]]). (September 2006)

==Powers==
The first Doctor Cyber had no powers but wore an armored suit that allowed her to physically fight Wonder Woman on near-equal terms. The suit enhanced her strength and endurance and also allowed her to redirect energy when fired at the suit. She also used a variety of weaponry that included [[laser]] pistols, [[mind control]] serum, an [[cloaking device|invisibility screen]], rocket sleds, and myriad [[robot]] assassins.

The second Doctor Cyber also wore an armored suit, but the abilities and limitations are as yet unknown.
