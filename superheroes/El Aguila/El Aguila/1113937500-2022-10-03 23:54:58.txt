'''El Águila''' ('''Alejandro Montoya''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. El Águila is patterned after the literary hero [[Zorro]].<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Callahan|first= Timothy|date= December 2010|title= Power Man and Iron Fist|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #45|pages= 3–11|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> His name is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the [[eagle]]".

The character made its live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'', played by Joseph Castillo-Midyett.

==Publication history==
El Águila was introduced as a recurring adversary of [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' writer [[Jo Duffy|Mary Jo Duffy]] recounted his creation: {{quote|El Águila was designed by [[Dave Cockrum]] and he had this big [[Zorro]] thing, and Zorro was another one of these characters that I was just crazy about and Power Man and Iron Fist was tricky. These were not guys who could fly. Their superpowers were defensive and if they were offensive, it was going to be hands-on, and it's remarkably tricky inventing a [[villain]] for somebody like that ... It seemed to me that someone like Zorro but with one or two powers would be about the right level and since Iron Fist was a little bit easygoing and unworldly, and Power Man was just so cranky and completely grounded in the here and now, giving him somebody with this playful panache would be frustrating. Iron Fist wouldn’t even get it, Power Man would be infuriated by it, and it would give El Águila a certain amount of charm. So I wasn’t just thinking of the power problem, though it was a problem, but in terms of the characters—it had to interest me. And Power Man and Iron Fist were so well-realized as characters that if a villain wasn’t as equally well-realized, then what was the point in doing it?<ref name="back45"/>}}

El Águila made his first appearance in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #58 (August [[1979 in comics|1979]]).<ref>[http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/aguila.htm El Aguila] (marveldirectory.com)</ref> The character made several subsequent appearances in the title, including issues #58 (Aug. 1979), 65 (October 1980), 78 (February 1982), and 99-100 (February–March 1982). He appeared in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]'' #1-3 (June–August 1982) and ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #3 (July 1982), and after an appearance in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #9 (December 1988) a few years later he was not seen for some time. He finally made a return with a cameo appearance in ''[[Great Lakes Avengers|G.L.A.]]'' #2 (July 2005), as well as ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'' (2006) and ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #18 (June 2006).

==Fictional character biography==
Alejandro Montoya was born in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and later moved to America. Upon discovering his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers, Alejandro decided to use his unique abilities as a swashbuckler and costumed crime fighter, taking up the mantle of El Águila (Spanish for "The Eagle"), an identity passed down by his ancestors. As El Águila, he preys upon drug dealers and criminals that take advantage of the poor and needy.  He is not a certified law authority and is wanted by authorities. Soon after launching his crime-fighting campaign against drug dealers, slumlords, brutal police, and other wrongdoers, Águila encountered [[Iron Fist (character)|Iron Fist]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], and [[Misty Knight]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Jo Duffy|Duffy, Mary Jo]]|penciller=  [[Trevor Von Eeden|Von Eeden, Trevor]]|inker= [[Dan Green (artist)|Green, Dan]]|story = El Aguila Has Landed|title = [[Power Man and Iron Fist]]|issue= #58|date = Aug. 1979}}</ref>

Though Alejandro now has no powers, he was still considered a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Ronald Byrd|Byrd, Ronald]]; [[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]]|penciller= [[Scott Kolins|Kolins, Scott]]|inker= Kolins, Scott|title= [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Battle Damage Report]]|issue= #1|date = March 2007}}</ref> because of his expertise in sword fighting and hand-to-hand combat.
