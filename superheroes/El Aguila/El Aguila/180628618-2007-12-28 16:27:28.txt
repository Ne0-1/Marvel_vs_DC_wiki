'''El Aguila''' ('''Alejandro Montoya''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe.  He made his first appearance in [[Power Man and Iron Fist]] #58<ref>[http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/aguila.htm El Aguila] (marveldirectory.com)</ref>.  El Aguila is patterned after the literary hero, [[Zorro]].

==Fictional character biography==
Alejandro Montoya was born in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and later moved to America. Upon discovering his mutant powers, Alejandro decided to use his unique abilities as a swashbuckler and costumed crime fighter, taking up the mantle of El Aguila (The Eagle), an identity passed down by his ancestors. As El Aguila, he preys upon drug dealers and criminals that take advantage of the poor and needy.  He is not a certified law authority and is wanted by authorities.

Soon after launching his crime-fighting campaign against drug dealers, slumlords, brutal police, and other wrongdoers, Aguila encountered [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], and [[Misty Knight]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #58</ref> Aguila aided Power Man and Iron Fist against female assassins out to kill [[Jeryn Hogarth]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #65</ref>  He also battled [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #1</ref> Aguila teamed up with Power Man and Iron Fist to capture the [[Sabretooth (comics)|Slasher]], and fought the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #78</ref> Alongside [[Colleen Wing]] and Misty Knight, he battled mercenaries working for [[Ward Meachum]] and fought [[Ferocia|Fera]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #99</ref> He aided Power Man, Iron Fist, Colleen Wing, [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Bob Diamond]], and [[Rafael Scarfe]] in an attempt to rescue Misty Knight and [[D.W.

Aguila was confirmed to have been [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]]<ref name="newavengers18">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller =  [[Mike Deodata Jr]] | Inker = [[Joe Pimentel]] | Story = The Collective Part 2 | Title = New Avengers | Issue = 18 | Date = June 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> following the events of "M-Day." Though Alejandro now has no powers, he was still considered a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.

==Powers and abilities==
Aguila had the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to generate electrostatic charges and discharge up to 100,000 volts through conductive metal.  He most often uses his double-edged steel sword for this purpose, emulating his idol, Zorro.  He is a skilled fencer with extaordinary swordsmanship skills, an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and an excellent acrobat.

==Predecessors==
*In '''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'', the first known '''Aguila''' precursor was an [[Aztec]] hero known as both '''Cuauhtli''' and the ''Eagle'''.  He had the identity over 1000 years prior to Montoya.
*''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'' also identifies the first [[Spain|Spanish]] speaking Aguila to use the name.  Not much is known of this Aguila.
*'''Paco Montoya''' was the '''Aguila''' of the [[Old West]].  He was a Spaniard and the brother of Enrique.  He is Alejandro's ancestor.  He disappeared in the 1880s but apparently perished in battle with Devadia's Tarantula in the 1890s.  He first appeared in ''Original Ghost Rider'' #15 and appeared right through until issue #20.  Also had an entry in the ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*A [[Delvadia]]n friend of Paco Montoya took on the mantle of '''Aguila''' after Montoya's death in the 1890s.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*The son of the friend of Paco took the role of '''Aguila''' after his father.  He traveled to [[Spain]] in the 1930s to oppose the USSR-supported Loyalists.  He clashed with and seemingly slew [[Captain Terror]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and eventually returned to [[Central America]] and settled in [[Oroco]].  He passed the title on to another.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*In the 1950s, the mantle of '''Aguila''' was taken on by another descendant while vacationing in the [[Sierra Madres]] during the mid-1950s.  He encountered and defeated the [[Ambassador of Terror]] and vanished soon after while investigating a subterranean coral city beneath the Gulf of Mexico.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*A [[Santo Rica]]n, took the mantle of '''Aguila''' in the 1970s and was an agent of their communist regime.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*In the 1980s, the next ''Aguila'' assisted the leftist freedom fighters in [[Terra Verde (comics)|Terra Verde]] and was executed by Caridad's death squads.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.

==Controversy==
The comics' rendition of El Aguila's native Spain and its people is considered highly stereotypical and inaccurate by many Spanish readers. This is due to the fact that the usual depiction of "Spanish" landscapes, cities and people in El Aguila's exploits are evidently influenced by those in Zorro's (whose adventures were set in 19th Century California). This is made evident by the depiction of the highly populated present-day [[Madrid]] as a tiny Mexican village full of peasants and donkeys.
