'''El Aguila (Alejandro Montoya)''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe.  He made his first appearance in [[Power Man and Iron Fist]] #58 [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/aguila.htm].  

==Fictional character history==
Alejandro Montoya was born in [[Montoya, Spain|Montoya]], Spain, and later moved to America. Upon discovering his mutant powers, Alejandro decided to use his unique abilities as a costumed crimefighter, taking up the mantle of El Aguila (The Eagle), an identity passed down by his ancestors. As El Aguila, he preys upon drug dealers and criminals that take advantage of the poor and needy.  He is not a certified law authority and is wanted by authorities. El Aguila is patterned after the literary hero, [[Zorro]].

Aguila has been confirmed to having been [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]]<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref> following the events of "M-Day."

==Predecessors==
*In ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'', the first known '''Aguila''' precursor was an [[Aztec]] hero known as both '''Cuauhtli''' and the ''Eagle'''.  He had the identity over 1000 years prior to Montoya.
*''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'' also identifies the first [[Spain|Spanish]] speaking Aguila to use the name.  Not much is known of this Aguila.
*'''Paco Montoya''' was the '''Aguila''' of the [[Old West]].  He was a Spaniard and the brother of Enrique.  He is Alejandro's ancestor.  He disappeared in the 1880's but apparently perished in battle with Devadia's Tarantula in the 1890's.  He first appeared in ''Original Ghost Rider'' #15 and appeared right through until issue #20.  Also had an entry in the ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*A [[Delvadia|Delvadian]] friend of Paco Montoya took on the mantle of '''Aguila''' after Montoya's death in the 1890's.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*The son of the friend of Paco took the role of '''Aguila''' after his father.  He traveled to [[Spain]] in the 1930's to oppose the USSR-supported Loyalists.  He clashed with and seemingly slew [[Captain Terror]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and eventually returned to [[Central America]] and settled in [[Oroco]].  He passed the title on to another.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*In the 1950's, the mantle of '''Aguila''' was taken on by another descendant while vacationing in the [[Sierra Madres]] during the mid-1950's.  He encountered and defeated the [[Ambassador of Terror]] and vanished soon after while investigating a subterranean coral city beneath the Gulf of Mexico.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*A [[Santo Rica|Santo Rican]], took the mantle of '''Aguila''' in the 1970's and was an agent of their communist regime.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.
*In the 1980's, the next ''Aguila'' assisted the leftist freedom fighters in [[Terra Verde]] and was executed by Caridad's death squads.  First mentioned in ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files''.

==Controversy==
The comics' rendition of El Aguila´s native Spain and its people is considered highly stereotypical and innacurate by many Spanish readers. This is due to the fact that the usual depiction of "Spanish" landscapes, cities and people in El Aguila's exploits are evidently influenced by those in Zorro´s (whose adventures were set in 19th Century California). This is made evident by the depiction of the highly populated present Madrid as a tiny Mexican village full of peasants and donkeys.

==Powers==
Aguila had the mutant ability to discharge up to 100,000 volts through conductive matter, most often a sword, emulating his idol, Zorro.  He is a skilled fencer.
