'''Blackheart''' is a [[fictional]] [[demon]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]], and [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' (1st series) #270 (Sept. [[1989]]). He is the "son" of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and the [[archenemy]] of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].

==Fictional character biography==
Centuries of murder in a locale named Christ's Crown, New York, drew the attention of a demon-lord, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who created a "son", Blackheart, from the energy of the accumulated evil.  Blackheart explored the nature of evil under his father's tutelage, clashing with and failing to corrupt [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #270</ref> Mephisto and Blackheart once tormented Daredevil, Brandy Ash, the genetically engineered [[Number Nine (comics)|Number Nine]], and the [[Inhumans]] [[Gorgon (comics)#Gorgon the Inhuman|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], and [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]], manipulating their emotions and tricking them. They were soon drawn into hell for worse torments. Brandy Ash did not survive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #278-282</ref>

Later, in an attempt to be free of captivity, Blackheart made contact with Misha from the group [[Warheads (comics)|Warheads]] and became the source of her pre-cognitive visions. Eventually Misha's squad, Kether Troop, invaded Hell itself and freed Blackheart, who was temporarily in the disguise of [[Doctor Strange]].

Mephisto sent Blackheart to Earth with diminished powers to learn humility. Blackheart would return to Christ's Crown and tempt [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], [[Punisher]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] to the town itself in an attempt to corrupt them. The group would eventually follow Blackheart back into his own realm for a final confrontation.<ref>''Heart of Darkness''</ref>

Alongside the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], Blackheart brought [[Wonder Man]] to Mephisto's realm to battle Mephisto.<ref>''Wonder Man'' #22</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blackheart is a powerful [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] of the highest order, created by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. He possesses vast inherent [[supernatural]] powers, including superhuman strength, speed, and endurance which are magical in nature. He also has telekinetic and telepathic powers, and can levitate, teleport inter-dimensionally, change his size and physical form, enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will, heal himself at the molecular level, and has the ability to generate various forms of energies for destructive purposes such as powerful concussive blasts of black energy. Unlike his father, he can capture a soul against the will of the person he is stealing it from.

==In other media==
===Film===
In the [[2007]] film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'', directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]] and starring [[Nicholas Cage]] as [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider]], Blackheart is  portrayed by [[Wes Bentley]]. He is the main villain, alongside his father [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (portrayed  by [[Peter Fonda]]).

Unlike his comic book-counterpart, in which he is a large black-skinned demon with quills on  his head, a tail and red eyes; in the film, Blackheart assumes his "human" form, with white, pale skin and black hair, though at many points in the film, he shows his demonic facial features (having black eyes and large fangs). Despite having many presumed supernatural powers, he mainly uses his hands to kill people with a "lethal touch". He also reveals the ability to sense people by "smelling their fear". He is immune to the Ghost Rider's ''Penance Stare'', as "he has no soul". At the end of the film, when he becomes ''[[Legion (demon)|Legion]]'', his powers are greatly enhanced; he is nearly invincible, and gets the ability to regenerate any body part that he has lost.

Blackheart first appears in the film, searching for the Three Fallen Angels (a.k.a., ''The Hidden''), Abigor (Wind Demon), Wallow (Water Demon) and Grissel (Earth Demon), in a bar, where he kills all the humans. He aligns The Hidden with him on a quest to obtain the contract of San Venganza (that allows the user access to the power of 1,000 souls) before his father, Mephistopheles. But when Mephisto finds out about his son's search for the contract, he turns Johnny Blaze, a stunt-motorcyclist (who had traded his soul as a young teenager in return for his father's good health), into the next ''Ghost Rider'', "The Devil's Bounty Hunter", to track down and kill Blackheart and his minions. The Rider first kills Grissel at an empty train station; then, kills Abigor on top of a building using his chain; and, finally kills the last member of The Hidden, Wallow in a lake. Blaze then tracks down Blackheart in the town of San Venganza and hands over the contract to him in return for his girlfriend, Roxanne Simpson ([[Eva Mendes]]). Reading from the contract, Blackheart calls for all the 1,000 cursed souls to enter his body and together they form a "new" demon, who calls himself ''[[Legion (demon)|Legion]]''. Blaze, realizing that Blackheart/Legion now has 1,000 souls to be burnt, becomes the Ghost Rider and uses his ''Penance Stare'' to finally kill him. At the end, Mephisto arrives at the scene and takes away his son's dead corpse back to [[Hell]].
