'''Blackheart''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a [[demon]], the "son" of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[John Romita Jr.]], he [[first]] appeared in [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] Vol.1, #270 (Sept. 1989). He is the [[archenemy]] of [[Ghost Rider]].

==Fictional character biography==
Centuries of murder in a locale named Christ's Crown drew the attention of a demon-lord, Mephisto, who created a "son", Blackheart, from the energy of the accumulated evil.  Blackheart explored the nature of evil under his father's tutelage, clashing with and failing to corrupt [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]]. Mephisto and Blackheart soon drew Daredevil, Brandy Ash, the genetically engineered Number Nine, and the [[Inhumans]] [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], and Ahura into Hell. 

Observing these mortals led Blackheart to rebel against his father and seek a newer form of evil; in retaliation, Mephisto diminished Blackheart's powers. Focusing on those who straddled good and evil, Blackheart tried and failed to recruit [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (Logan), the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] (Frank Castle) and the [[Ghost Rider]] (Dan Ketch) to his rebellion. Blackheart also aided [[Wonder Man]] against Mephisto and helped a [[mercenary]] named Misha by serving as her telepathic "Voice". Returning to Christ's Crown in an attempt to corrupt a young girl named Lucy Crumm, a pure soul with powers including a calming influence and telepathy, Blackheart was once more defeated by Ghost Rider, Wolverine and the Punisher. When Mephisto appeared to express his disappointment in his wayward son, Blackheart apparently slew Mephisto with a dagger touched by Lucy's blood, banishing his "father" from Hell and restored his own powers to full strength. 

As Hell's ruler, Blackheart focused on corrupting and tormenting Ghost Rider, one of the Spirits of Vengeance. From his palace in the Burning Flesh district, Blackheart created his own Spirits of Vengeance: his consort Black Rose (the deceased Roxanne Simpson, ex-wife of Dan Ketch's brother, [[Ghost Rider#Johnny Blaze|Johnny Blaze]]), Verminus Rex (a spirit who had battled Ghost Rider during World War I), Wallow (a homicidal mortal suicide whom Ghost Rider had thwarted), Doghead (a downtrodden immigrant), and Pao Fu (who had died in the arms of Ghost Rider as he tried to save her). Blackheart bargained to free Ghost Rider's relatives from their curse; in return, Ghost Rider agreed to lead Blackheart's Spirits. However, the pair fell out and Ghost Rider banished Blackheart from Hell.

While ruler of Hell, Blackheart had tormented the soul of the mutant [[Stryfe]] by manipulating the [[X-Force]] group, which attracted the attention of the mutant sorceress [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. After banishment from Hell, Blackheart allied with Selene as the temporary Black King of the evil, [[chess]]-nomenclatured [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. After defeating Selene's enemy, Alyssa Moy, Blackheart battled the [[Fantastic Four]], Mechamage, [[Hellstorm]], and [[Margali Szardos]]; they ultimately defeated Blackheart, binding him beneath New York's Hellfire Club. Trapped there, he continued to aid Selene, opposing X-Force in an attempt to corrupt [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]].

==Powers and abilities==
Blackheart is a powerful [[demon]] of the highest order and possesses [[supernatural]] powers. He is essentially [[invincible]] to anything but the most powerful magic. He has [[superhuman]] strength and endurance which, being magical in nature, are potentially incalculably high. His speed is also incalculably high and his intelligence surpasses some of the smartest beings alive nearing him to [[omniscience]]. His [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] and [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers give him abilities beyond most demons of his level. 

He also has the ability of flight and the ability to combine his superspeed with his flight. His powers also include Phasing and teleportation. He possesses virtually infinite psionic power which he can draw endlessly from hyperspace, from which (in the Marvel Universe) the primordial energies creating the fundamental forces of the universe, strong nuclear force, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and gravity flow into our plane of reality. Controlling the four fundamental forces should theoretically allow him to restructure, create or destroy matter at will down to subatomic level, as well as creating electromagnetic fields and electrical currents, making matter radioactive, manipulating gravity, causing nuclear detonations, emit enormous energy blasts, use his psionic powers to increase his physical strength and generally accomplishing nearly anything he sets his mind to. 

It had been argued that Blackheart had the destructive powers of the Power Cosmic, but those rumors are false, even though the level of his power is near the power cosmic.  Blackheart has the ability to generate a "Dark Energy", which he can transfer into destructive blasts, into a type of "Dark Fire" and "Dark Lighting". He also has the ability to generate a blast of super cold energy used to freeze enemies. He lost his practically infinite psionic powers when he attacked Mephisto and his mind was decimated. When his mind was shattered, he lost all memory of ever having his psionic powers, and was filled with nothing but hatred and greed until he was finally defeated. When he lost the majority of his powers, he became even less threatening to Mephisto and was banished from the hellish dimension Mephisto ruled. 

He has the ability to change the size and physical form of himself, which gives him an amazing [[shape-shifting]] ability. He can survive under almost any condition, so he doesn't need food, water, sleep or air to survive, and is resistant to temperatures that are as hot as the surface of the sun.
He can assume human form, but prefers to remain in his true form. This may explain why in the upcoming movie "Ghost Rider" he seems to be in human form.

He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has reality warping powers, which have been compared to those of [[Franklin Richards]]. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.

Blackheart has the ability to take different forms and confuse the minds of other people, making their worst aspects dominant. He also displayed an impressive healing ability, regenerating whenever Mephisto tried to "discipline" him. His regenerative properties are amazingly high, being able to regenerate after total particle desintegration. He can also liquify himself. Since becoming the Lord of Hell, it can be assumed Blackheart has all the powers Mephisto once held.

As an interesting side note, he smells unpleasantly of burning ink and roses, and has no discernible heartbeat.
