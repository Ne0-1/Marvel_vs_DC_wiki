'''Blackheart''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a [[demon]], the son of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. He first appeared in Daredevil (Vol.1) #270. 

==Character history==
Blackheart first appeared in the pages of ''[[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]]'', and went on to menace [[Ghost Rider]], [[The Punisher]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  Blackheart once killed Mephisto and briefly ruled his [[Hell]]-like dimension, but he was deposed by the Ghost Rider; his father later returned to life and took control of that realm.  Blackheart was most recently seen as the Black King of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].

==Powers and abilities==
Blackheart is a powerful demon of the highest order and possesses vast supernatural powers. He is essentially invincible to anything but the most powerful magic. He has vast superhuman strength and endurance which, being magical in nature, are potentially incalculably high. His speed is also incalculably high and his intelligence surpasses some of the smartest beings alive nearing him to omniscience. His telekinetic and telepathic powers give him abilities beyond most demons of his level. He also has the ability of flight and the ability to combine his superspeed with his flight.

He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has reality warping powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.

{{wikibooks|Fighting Game Moves/Capcom/Blackheart}}
Blackheart is also a [[playable character]] in several entries in the [[Marvel VS. Series]] of [[video game]]s.  In his first two appearances, he was largely a [[defensive]] character with powerful normal moves and damaging combos; in [[Marvel vs. Capcom 2]], his ability to cancel normal moves with an airdash makes him ideal at runaway, due to his ability to summon demons of varying effects as a normal move.

[[Wes Bentley]] is portraying Blackheart in the upcoming 2006 movie, Ghost Rider, to be released by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. By all indications, he appears to have an entirely human appearance, but it remains entirely possible that this could be a facade.
