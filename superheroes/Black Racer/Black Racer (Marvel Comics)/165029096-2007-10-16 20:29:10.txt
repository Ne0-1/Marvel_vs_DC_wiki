'''Black Racer''' ('''Ariana''') is a [[super villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]], most notably a member of the second [[Serpent Society]], who first appeared in ''Captain America'' #337 (January 1988).  

==Fictional character biography==
A quiet woman with super speed, Black Racer first joined the fourth [[Serpent Squad]], robbing a casino in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] took note of this, and invited the Serpent Squad to join his [[Serpent Society]].  They accepted, but were really just a ploy to get [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] into the leadership position of the Society.  Black Racer was among the several members to side with Viper and betray Sidewinder.  She was ordered by Viper to search all the hospitals in the area for the injured former leader.  However, after Viper abandoned the group, Black Racer continued to serve with the Society under leadership of [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]].  She also participated in a race between [[super hero]]es and villains with super speed.  However, she disappeared for quite some time, only resurfacing recently alongside the rest of the Serpent Society as they sought to exact their revenge on [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]].

She, like [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]] has some confusion as to what her [[ethnicity]] is, sometimes depicted as [[Caucasian race|caucasian]], others as [[African-American]].
