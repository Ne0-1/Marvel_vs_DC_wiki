'''Genesis''' (real name '''Tyler Dayspring''') was a character in [[Marvel Comics]] and a foe of Wolverine.  He was a mutant with abilities that were never fully disclosed.  His first appearance was ''New Mutants #98'', published in [[1991]].

Genesis was the son of the character associated with the [[X-Men]] called [[Cable]], who came from the future.  He had been abducted by the villain Apocalyse as a child and corrupted. Genesis was a [[time travel]]ler who came from an alternate future of Earth, as did Cable.

Genesis sought to replace Apocoplypse and chose Wolverine to be a soldier in his army, the Dark Riders. He attempted to erase Wolverine's mind and re-bond adamantium to Wolverine's skeleton.  On both accounts he failed. Wolverine's mutation was sent into overdrive and he reverted into a beast-like, almost simian form. Wolverine killed Genesis.
