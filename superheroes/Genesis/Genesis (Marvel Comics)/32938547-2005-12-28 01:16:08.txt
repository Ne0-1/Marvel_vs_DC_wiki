'''Genesis''' (real name '''Tyler Dayspring''') is a fictional character in the comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]].  He is a foe of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  His first appearance was as '''"Mister Tolliver"''' in ''[[X-Force]]'' #5 (1992); his first appearance as Tyler Dayspring was ''Cable'' volume 2 #1, and his first appearance as Genesis was in ''Cable'' volume 2 #19. He is a mutant. 

==Character Biography==
Tyler is the son of Cable, the mutant cyborg from the future. He had been abducted by the villain [[Stryfe]] as a child and corrupted. He used [[time travel]] to come to the present, following his father. Adopting the alias of Tolliver, he hired the mercenary [[Deadpool]] and the futuristic android [[Zero (comics)|Zero]] to assassinate those whose deaths would change the future to his liking.

Later, adopting the identity '''Genesis''', Tyler sought to replace [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] in his role as warlord in the future history of his timeline, and chose [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] to be a soldier in his army, the Dark Riders. He attempted to erase Wolverine's mind and re-bond adamantium to Wolverine's skeleton.  On both accounts he failed. Wolverine's mutation was sent into overdrive and he reverted into a beast-like, almost simian form. Wolverine killed Genesis in ''Wolverine'' volume 2 #100.

==Powers==
He was a mutant with ability to form a psionic link with another consciousness and visually project those memories as solid holograms. (Genesis mutant ability is revealed in "''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004''")
