'''Genesis''' (real name '''Tyler Dayspring''') was a character in [[Marvel Comics]] and a foe of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  He was a mutant with abilities that were never fully disclosed.  His first appearance was as "Mister Tolliver" in ''[[X-Force]]'' #5 ([[1992]]); his first appearance as Tyler Dayspring was ''Cable'' volume 2 #1, and his first appearance as Genesis was in ''Cable'' volume 2 #19.

Tyler was the son of Cable, the mutant cyborg from the future. He had been abducted by the villain [[Stryfe]] as a child and corrupted. He used [[time travel]] to come to the present, following his father. Adopting the alias of Tolliver, he hired the mercenary [[Deadpool]] and the futuristic android [[Zero (comics)|Zero]] to assassinate those whose deaths would change the future to his liking.

Later, adopting the identity Genesis, Tyler sought to replace [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] in his role as warlord in the future history of his timeline, and chose [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] to be a soldier in his army, the Dark Riders. He attempted to erase Wolverine's mind and re-bond adamantium to Wolverine's skeleton.  On both accounts he failed. Wolverine's mutation was sent into overdrive and he reverted into a beast-like, almost simian form. Wolverine killed Genesis in ''Wolverine'' volume 2 #100.
