==Fictional character biography==
Dionysus is the son of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].

Despondent at a former defeat at the hands of [[She-Hulk]], Dionysus became suicidal. He came to believe the Olympian race was dying, so he stole a nuclear warhead from earth to help it along. Hercules attempts to talk him out of it, but Dionysus crafts a servant called 'Butcher T. Washington' to deal with him. Hercules was almost slain but at the last moment, Dionysus regains his sanity, saves Hercules and returns the warhead to Earth. He places himself at Zeus' mercy. As punishment, he is stripped of his memories and abilities. He ends up on Earth, as Dion, the bartender for 'Dion's Bar'.<ref>Solo Avengers #11</ref>

Later, while back on Olympus, he becomes so inebriated, he falls off the edge and lands on Earth itself, namely 'Christmas Mountain' in [[Wisconsin]] <ref>Deadpool/GLI: Summer Fun Spectacular #1 (September 2007)</Ref>. He is taken by the terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] They use his powers to cause mental instabillity in all the superheroes they consider a threat. At a pre-determined time, all affected bases are invaded. The [[Great Lakes Avengers]] and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] rescue Dionysus just in time for the affected heroes to regain their stabillity and defeat their respective invading A.I.M. forces. [[Squirrel Girl]] helps Dionysus back to Olympus and into his own bed to sleep it off.

==Powers and abilities==
Dionysus can control the growth of vines and grapes. He once had control of a pig that could create wine. At least in ancient times he could change his own shape and that of other things.
