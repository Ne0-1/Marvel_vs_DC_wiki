==Fictional character biography==
Dionysus is the son of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].

Despondent at a former defeat at the hands of [[She-Hulk]], Dionysus became suicidal. He came to believe the Olympian race was dying, so he stole a nuclear warhead from earth to help it along. Hercules attempts to talk him out of it, but Dionysus crafts a servant called 'Butcher T. Washington' to deal with him. Hercules was almost slain but at the last moment, Dionysus regains his sanity, saves Hercules and returns the warhead to Earth. He places himself at Zeus' mercy. As punishment, he is stripped of his memories and abilities. He ends up on Earth, as Dion, the bartender for 'Dion's Bar'.<ref>Solo Avengers #11</ref>

Later, while back on Olympus, he becomes so inebriated, he falls off the edge and lands on Earth itself, namely 'Christmas Mountain' in [[Wisconsin]]. He is taken by the terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] They use his powers to cause mental instability in all the superheroes they consider a threat. At a pre-determined time, all affected bases are invaded. The [[Great Lakes Avengers]] and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] rescue Dionysus just in time for the affected heroes to regain their stability and defeat their respective invading A.I.M. forces. [[Squirrel Girl]] helps Dionysus back to Olympus and into his own bed to sleep it off. <ref>Deadpool/GLI: Summer Fun Spectacular #1 (September 2007)</ref>

==Other versions==
A 23rd century version of Dionysus is murdered on panel by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]. <ref>Hercules vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March - June 1984)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dionysus can control the growth of vines and grapes. He once had control of a pig that could create wine. At least in ancient times he could change his own shape and that of other things. Lack of access to wine causes him to rapidly age. <ref>"Thor: Blood Oath" #1-4</ref>
