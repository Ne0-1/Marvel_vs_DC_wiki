==Fictional character biography==
Dionysus is the son of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]. When [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] was gravely injured during the assault by the [[Masters of Evil]] on [[Avengers Mansion]], Dionysus served Zeus in his attempt to punish the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for these injries. Dionysus disguised himself as an Italian ice vendor, and served it to [[She-Hulk]] laced with Elixir of Frenzy.  She attacked the other Avengers, and when [[Doctor Druid]] tried to restore her to normal, Dionysus reinstilled the elixir's potency. [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] noticed him and tried to subdue him, but Dionysus strangled Doctor Druid and used a potion to knock She-Hulk unconscious.<ref>''Avengers'' #281</ref> Dionysus then fought She-Hulk in physical combat, this time in [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], but she struck him down with a pillar.<ref>''Avengers'' #283-284</ref> Zeus then forbade all Olympians from interfering with the earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #285</ref>

Despondent at his defeat at the hands of She-Hulk, Dionysus became suicidal. He came to believe the Olympian race was dying, so he stole a nuclear warhead from earth to help it along. Hercules attempts to talk him out of it, but Dionysus crafts a servant called 'Butcher T. Washington' to deal with him. Hercules was almost slain but at the last moment, Dionysus regains his sanity, saves Hercules and returns the warhead to Earth. He places himself at Zeus' mercy. As punishment, he is stripped of his memories and abilities. He ends up on Earth, as Dion, the bartender for 'Dion's Bar'.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #11</ref>

Later, while back on Olympus, he becomes so inebriated, he falls off the edge and lands on Earth itself, namely 'Christmas Mountain' in [[Wisconsin]]. He is taken by the terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] They use his powers to cause mental instability in all the superheroes they consider a threat. At a pre-determined time, all affected bases are invaded. The [[Great Lakes Avengers]] and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] rescue Dionysus just in time for the affected heroes to regain their stability and defeat their respective invading A.I.M. forces. [[Squirrel Girl]] helps Dionysus back to Olympus and into his own bed to sleep it off. <ref>''Deadpool/GLI: Summer Fun Spectacular'' #1 (September 2007)</ref>

==Other versions==
A 23rd century version of Dionysus is murdered on panel by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]. <ref>''Hercules'' vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March - June 1984)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dionysus can control the growth of vines and grapes. He once had control of a pig that could create wine. At least in ancient times he could change his own shape and that of other things. Lack of access to wine causes him to rapidly age.<ref>''Thor: Blood Oath'' #1-4</ref> He proved to be strong enough to fight toe-and-toe against [[She-Hulk]].{{Issue|date=June 2011}}
