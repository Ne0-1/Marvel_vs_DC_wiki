'''X-Man''', also called '''Nate Grey''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  He first appeared in ''X-Man'' #1.

Nathan Grey originated in the [[alternate universe]] called the [[Age of Apocalypse]], where he was created from the [[genetic]] material of that universe's [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] by [[Mister Sinister]]. After helping that world's [[X-Men]] fight [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], he was transported to the [[Marvel Universe]] ([[Earth-616]]). He came into conflict with the "real" X-Men on several occasions due to not understanding how the Marvel Universe differed from his own. Later, he became an ally of the X-Men and [[Spider-Man]], joined [[Havok]]'s short-lived [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], and even joined the X-Men in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' (volume 2) #1. Later, he became a "[[psychic]] [[shaman]]" and protector of the [[multiverse]]. In the final issue of ''X-Man'' (#75), he sacrificed himself to save the Earth.
