==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
====Earth-Two version====
Professor Chemico of Holliday College creates a climate changing machine which can make hot and cold climates. He plans to use the machine to make the North Pole into a warm fertile area. Queen Snowina of Iceberg-Land learns about the invention and fears the machine will melt her people and their civilization. Her advisor '''Prime Minister Blizzard''' convinces Snowina to let him steal the invention. Minister Blizzard steals the climate changing machine from Chemico and the Holliday Girls, trapping them in a block of ice. While Wonder Woman rescues the girls, Blizzard uses the machine to create a giant glacier to threaten New York. When Snowina discovers his plan, Blizzard captures her and sends the glacier against New York, using the Holliday Girls as hostages to prevent a counterattack. Wonder Woman manages to stop him and then makes peace with Snowina while Blizzard is taken into custody. Ultimately, Chemico's invention is not used to change any area of the Earth's climate and is largely forgotten about.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #29 (1944). DC Comics.</ref>

====Earth-One version====
Minister Blizzard appears next in ''Wonder Woman'' #162. While walking in [[Manhattan]] with [[Steve Trevor]], Wonder Woman suddenly finds that the city has been iced over by a weapon created by Minister Blizzard. Blizzard captures Wonder Woman with her own lasso and begins to carry out his plan to steal Manhattan Island. Wonder Woman is able to create a diversion and cause Blizzard to drop her lasso. Wonder Woman then escapes, rescues Steve, and destroys Blizzard's forces.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #162. DC Comics.</ref>

Minister Blizzard later joins a group of other ice-powered villains. Minister Blizzard, [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] and [[Captain Cold]] joined together in a foray to freeze a small South American country. By creating a miniature "Ice Age" in Ecuador, the three villains distracted the [[Justice League]] long enough to stage a crime spree in [[Gotham City]]. The capture of the three villains by the Earth-1 counterparts of Wonder Woman, the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Green Arrow]], and [[Black Canary]] failed to end the trouble in Ecuador, leading to the true mastermind who had hired the three cold-based criminals: [[Shadow Thief]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #139.
