==Fictional character biography==
===Baron Heinrich Zemo===
'''Dr. Heinrich Zemo, 12th Baron Zemo''' was one of the top [[scientist]]s in the [[Nazi Party]]. Zemo fought both Captain America and his allies the Howling Commandos during [[World War II]]. A brilliant and sadistic scientific genius, Zemo created many weapons of mass destruction for Hitler's army, including a large-scale [[death ray]] cannon, a disintegration [[handgun|pistol]] that was a [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] version of his death ray, and primitive [[Android (robot)|android]]s of considerable strength and durability. Heinrich Zemo's intelligence was only matched by his sadism, as he routinely tested his deadly weapons on innocent people, both prisoner and civilian inside the Third Reich. This ultimately came to a head, during an early encounter with the Howling Commandos, when Zemo decided to test an experimental death-ray cannon on a nearby German town. The death-ray killed hundreds of innocent German civilians as a result, making Zemo a mass murderer. Though he arrogantly believed that he could frame the Allied Forces for his act of mass murder, [[Nick Fury]] and his fellow Howling Commandos exposed Zemo's role in the town's destruction, resulting in Zemo becoming a reviled figure throughout [[Europe]], even amongst his fellow Germans.

In an attempt to regain a level of anonymity, Zemo began wearing a reddish-pink [[hood (headgear)|hood]] over his face as he continued to build weapons for the Nazis. His activities ultimately drew the attention of Captain America, resulting in a confrontation just as Heinrich was ready to unveil his newest scientific breakthrough: '''Adhesive X''', an extremely strong [[adhesive]] that could not be dissolved or removed by any known process at the time. It was only after the war that the adhesive-using villain [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]] found a way to neutralize it.

[[File:Heinrich origin.jpg|Heinrich Zemo explains how his hood became glued to his face. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].|thumb|left|149px]]

In order to ensure that the Nazis could not use Adhesive X against Allied troops, Captain America confronted Zemo in an attempt to destroy the limited supply.  Captain America threw his shield at the vat to release the adhesive onto the ground. Zemo however was standing right next to the vat containing the chemical, which poured over his hooded face. The adhesive quickly seeped inside and permanently attached the hood to Heinrich's flesh, preventing Zemo from ever removing his hood.<ref>''Avengers'' #6</ref>

Though Zemo could still see through the eye holes of the hood, as well as hear, breathe, and speak through the thin fabric of the cloth that made up the hood, Zemo could no longer eat normally (due to the hood having no mouth hole) and had to be fed [[intravenously]]. Heinrich Zemo quickly recovered but having his hood permanently attached to his face drove the Nazi scientist insane. Adopting a new costume to go along with his new hooded face, Zemo went from becoming a normal, if not infamous, Nazi scientist to become an active field agent for the Third Reich, leading German troops into combat and espionage missions. His reputation in combat quickly grew and was rivaled only by the [[Red Skull]]; the two quickly became rivals, united only in their hatred for Captain America.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

When it became apparent that the Nazis would lose the war, the Skull sent Zemo to [[London]] to steal an experimental [[airplane]].  At this point the plane would do them no good, but the Skull made sure this knowledge was leaked to Captain America and his young sidekick [[Bucky]] so as to ensure that Zemo would be caught, ridding him of his rival once and for all. Captain America would not learn of Zemo's scheme for several weeks, by which time he would defeat Red Skull for the final time during World War II, burying Skull alive in a state of suspended animation. By the time that Captain America learned of Zemo's plot, it was too late and both Captain America and his sidekick Bucky were taken prisoner by Zemo. Zemo tied the two heroes to the experimental plane, which was now booby-trapped to explode, and launched to their deaths.  Captain America fell from the plane as it exploded, and Bucky was apparently killed.  Captain America landed in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and was frozen in [[ice]] for decades until recovered by the recently formed Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #4</ref>

Believing that he had killed his rival at long last, Zemo fled to [[South America]] as Hitler and the Nazis fell and World War II ended. Zemo abandoned his long-suffering wife and toddler son, Helmut, whom he had become emotionally and physically abusive towards, after the mask was permanently bonded to his face. With an army of mercenaries loyal to him, Zemo enslaved a tribe of natives and lived as a king as he tried desperately to find a solvent that would remove his mask. As decades passed, Captain America was ultimately revived by the Avengers, causing Zemo to renew his rivalry with the Captain, after finding out about Cap's revival from a newspaper his pilot brought him, as he brought him supplies and news annually in exchange for gold.{{issue|date=November 2013}} Among his attempts included sending agents to take the place of participants of a hand-to-hand combat demonstration with Captain America in order to capture him. As Captain America learned that Zemo was behind this attack, he sent a taunting message on Zemo's minions' communicator to provoke the villain into becoming more carelessly aggressive against him and thus provide an opportunity for the superhero to deal with the villain directly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Stan|author2=Kirby, Jack|title=The Army of Assassins Strikes!|journal=Tales of Suspense|date=December 1964|volume=1|issue=60}}</ref>

To that end, Heinrich formed the [[Masters of Evil]] to serve as a villainous counterpart to the Avengers; the other founding members included the original villainous [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]], the [[Melter]], and the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]], who were gathered by his pilot. He tried to have Adhesive X spread over New York, but the Teen Brigade seized Zemo's pilot, preventing him from speaking, then tied him up to stop him causing trouble. They switched the adhesive with remover made by Paste-Pot Pete. Zemo used his sceptre's hypno-ray on the Teen Brigade, placing them under his control. He then battled Captain America using combat skills he had gained, but Captain America began to beat him. The pilot freed himself from his bonds and shot at Captain America from behind. Captain America heard the sound and dodged the bullet, though his skull was grazed. Giant-Man was able to stop the pilot from killing Captain America, thus capturing him. Zemo was tricked into opening a container of [[tear gas]] while in his helicopter during his escape back to [[South America]]. He was later joined by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and the [[executioner (comics)|Executioner]], who had been exiled to Earth from [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]. The Enchantress hypnotized Thor into attacking the Avengers, while the Executioner had disguised himself as a former ally of Zemo and lured Captain America to South America to fight Zemo. Iron Man broke Thor out of this trance and the Masters of Evil were sent to another dimension by Thor. Later Zemo created the superstrong Wonder Man with his ionic ray, and told Wonder Man he would die within a week unless given an antidote which Zemo possessed. Wonder Man was able to capture the Wasp and lead the group into a trap where they were defeated. Wonder Man, however, sacrificed himself to save the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #9</ref>

In his final battle with Captain America, Zemo lured the Captain to his jungle fortress by kidnapping Avengers ally [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] using an attractor ray. His [[Masters of Evil]] were broken out of prison and attacked the Avengers, forcing Captain America to go on alone. Zemo raised a glass cage containing Rick out of the ground as Captain America fired at his men, hoping Captain America would kill Rick, but the gunfire only broke open the cage. Zemo tried attacking with his men, but Captain America was able to use a rockslide caused by his shield to block them. In the ensuing battle, Captain America used his [[shield]] to deflect the sun's rays and cause Zemo to shoot blindly. His ray gun's shot hit a rock, starting an avalanche that killed him, and Captain America felt that Bucky's death had finally been avenged.<ref>''Avengers'' #15</ref>

During [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]' journey to the underworld, Baron Heinrich Zemo was seen in [[Erebus]], gambling for his resurrection. He was later seen as a member of [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s jury (alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Armless Tiger Man]], Artume, [[Commander Kraken]], [[Iron Monger]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], Kyknos, Nessus, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Scourge of the Underworld]], and [[Veranke]]) for [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' trial.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

===Baron Helmut Zemo===
[[File:Avengers277.png|Cover to ''Avengers'' #277.<br>Art by [[John Buscema]].|thumb|left|185px]]

Zemo's legacy was revived by his son, '''Helmut J. Zemo, 13th Baron Zemo''' who was born in [[Leipzig]], Germany. His father taught him the idea that the Master Race should rule the world. Helmut was originally an engineer until he became enraged when reading a report about the return of Captain America. Helmut would ultimately follow in his father's footsteps as a supervillain using his family's money and his own scientific know-how to recreate his father's work.

He first surfaced under the alias of The [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]], and captured Captain America to get revenge upon him for the death of his father. He was presumed deceased when he fell into a vat of boiling, specially-treated Adhesive X. As he had not been wearing his mask when he fell into the vat, his face was hideously [[scar]]red by the boiling Adhesive X, giving his face the appearance of molten wax.<ref>''Captain America'' #168</ref>

He resurfaced years later as '''Baron Zemo''', first allied with [[Arnim Zola]]'s [[mutation|mutate]]s. He allied with [[Primus (Marvel Comics)#Primus I|Primus]] I, and kidnapped Captain America's childhood friend [[Arnold Roth (Captain America)|Arnold Roth]] in order to lure Captain America into a trap.  He forced the Captain to battle hordes of mutates before revealing that he knew the Captain's secret identity.<ref>''Captain America'' #275-278</ref>

Zemo later encountered [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Mother Superior]] and her father the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Captain America'' #290</ref> Zemo underwent tutelage by Mother Superior and the Red Skull, and then kidnapped Captain America's friend David Cox and brainwashed him to battle the Captain.<ref>''Captain America'' #293-294</ref> Zemo then kidnapped Arnold Roth again, and directed a shared mental reenactment of Heinrich Zemo's last World War II encounter with Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #295-297</ref> Zemo then battled Mother Superior, but was psychically overpowered.<ref>''Captain America'' #299</ref>

Most notably, he formed a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil.  This fourth Masters of Evil was formed to strike at Captain America through the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; they invaded and occupied [[Avengers Mansion]] and crippled [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the Avengers' butler [[Edwin Jarvis]]. Zemo captured Captain America and the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. Zemo battled Captain America, but fell off the Mansion roof.<ref>''Avengers'' #273-277</ref>

Zemo later hired [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]]'s Brigade and psychic detective Tristram Micawber to help him locate the five fragments of the [[Bloodstone (comics)|Bloodstone]] in hopes of restoring his father to life. Zemo battled Captain America and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], but fell down an inactive volcano in Japan.<ref>''Captain America'' #357-362</ref>

Zemo was again believed dead,{{Issue|date=July 2009}} though he eventually returned, now married to a woman named Heike who had once called herself '''The Baroness''' and had claimed to be the [[reincarnation]] of Heinrich Zemo.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

[[File:Helmut as Citizen V.jpg|thumb|right|145px|Helmut Zemo as Citizen V. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
Zemo, having abandoned Heike to [[prison]], organized a new team of Masters of Evil when the Avengers and [[Fantastic Four]] disappeared during the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crisis and were presumed dead. These Masters of Evil took false identities and called themselves the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>Thunderbolts #1</ref> Leading them under the alias '''[[Citizen V#Baron Helmut Zemo|Citizen V]]''' (a twist of irony, as Heinrich Zemo had killed the original Citizen V during World War II) Zemo planned to have the Thunderbolts gain the world's trust in order to conquer it.<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997''</ref> The public took a liking to the team much more quickly than Zemo, or any of the other Thunderbolts, expected and soon most of them came to like the feeling of being heroes.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

When the missing heroes returned, Zemo had the Thunderbolts' true identities leaked, forcing them to flee with him into deep space to assist his plan to conquer the world through mind control.{{issue|date=June 2013}} However, most of the Thunderbolts rebelled and foiled Zemo's plan.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Zemo went into hiding and plotted revenge on his former teammates (who were trying to win back the public's trust by being true heroes).{{issue|date=June 2013}} After another of Zemo's plans was foiled by Captain America and a new Citizen V ([[Dallas Riordan]]),{{issue|date=June 2013}} Helmut was killed by the new [[Scourge of the Underworld]],{{issue|date=June 2013}} though his mind was transferred via bio-modem technology into the body of a comatose John Watkins III, grandson of the original Citizen V.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Now in possession of Watkins' body, Zemo again played the role of Citizen V, this time as a member of the V-Battalion,{{issue|date=June 2013}} until the Thunderbolts' final battle with Graviton, during which his consciousness was removed from Watkins' body and transferred, in [[electronics|electronic]] form, into his ally [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]'s mechanical "tech-pack".{{issue|date=June 2013}}

On the artificial world Counter-Earth - the same world to which the Avengers and Fantastic Four had previously vanished - the Thunderbolts encountered Zemo's counterpart in that world, '''Iron Cross'''.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Fixer transferred Zemo's mind into his double's un-mutilated body.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Zemo then took up leadership of the Thunderbolts who were on Counter-Earth;{{issue|date=June 2013}} when this group was reunited with their teammates who had remained on the normal [[Marvel Universe]] Earth,{{issue|date=June 2013}} [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] briefly resumed leadership,{{issue|date=June 2013}} but then left the team to return to the Avengers.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

For a while Zemo remained the leader of the Thunderbolts.{{issue|date=June 2013}}  In 2004's "Avengers/Thunderbolts" limited series he attempted to take over the world again — this time with the belief that he could save the world by taking it over.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Zemo now seems to be motivated by a twisted altruism rather than his original selfish desires; he feels he has grown beyond his father in that regard.{{issue|date=June 2013}} However, the Avengers foiled his scheme,{{issue|date=June 2013}} his teammate [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] went berserk,{{issue|date=June 2013}} Zemo's new body was blasted while he attempted to protect [[Captain America]],{{issue|date=June 2013}} and he left the team and went into hiding after obtaining Moonstone's twin alien gems, two artifacts of great power.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

[[File:Tbolts.PNG|thumb|left|frame|Cover for the second printing of ''Thunderbolts'' #104. Art by [[Tom Grummett]].]]
Zemo had been manipulating the United States government, the New Thunderbolts, the [[Purple Man]], the [[Squadron Sinister]], and a host of other relatively obscure Marvel characters.{{issue|date=June 2013}} His goals are unknown, but he is clearly still motivated by a desire to save the world by taking it over, or at least manipulating it towards what he perceives as a beneficial future. Zemo has also, apparently through trial and error, learned how to use the power of the moonstones in various ways, from simply generating raw energy, to transporting himself and others through time, space, and dimensions, to viewing possible future events through dimensional rifts—and, apparently, to repair his damaged face (or, to at least to create the illusion that it was undamaged).{{issue|date=June 2013}} He has also recruited members of both his original and subsequent incarnations of the Thunderbolts to his cause, as well as eventually bringing the current team of Thunderbolts around to joining him.{{issue|date=June 2013}} The group resides in what Zemo calls his "Folding Castle", a structure that he has connected to various other places around the world by dimensional portals.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

As a result of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, [[Iron Man]] asked Zemo to begin recruiting villains to his cause, which Zemo had begun doing some time before, unknown to Iron Man.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103</ref> However, he met up with Captain America and informed him that he really had reformed. He showed the Captain his face, once again scarred, to remind him of his earlier sacrifice, and gave him a key that would allow him to escape from the super-human prison being constructed if Captain America would allow his Thunderbolts to fight the Squadron Sinister.{{issue|date=June 2013}} He also gave the Captain all his old mementos, destroyed by Zemo in 'Avengers Under Siege', which he had gone back in time and rescued with the help of the Moonstones. Finally, the Captain agreed.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Zemo, always told as a child that he was superior, now believes his father's Nazi ideals to be untrue, and that the only way to become superior is through righteousness. After helping Captain America, he remarked to his father's portrait that the man would be displeased with today's good deeds. Zemo—once again wearing his unscarred face—then revealed to [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] that she was going to betray him and he was going to sacrifice himself in their upcoming battle with the Squadron Sinister. He told her that he would not die, but that he would become superior through his sacrifice, "by living forever."{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Zemo has now revealed his true nature in Thunderbolts #108, where he saved the Wellspring of Power from the Grandmaster, who planned to use it for his own ends. Believing that all of his visions were subject to the flow of time, and that nothing was set in stone, Zemo defeated the Grandmaster, and boasted to his teammates that the power was now all his—and theirs. He insisted that he would use it to help the world, despite the consequences for doing so. Songbird, who had temporarily lost her powers during the final battle, was told by Zemo "...now is when your betrayal would have come." However, the vision of her betrayal turned out to be true after all. Using a simple opera note to crack the moonstones, Songbird sent Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic time/space. Just before he was completely sucked into the vacuum, he screamed out that he "would never have hurt a world he worked so hard to save".{{issue|date=August 2012}}

The limited series ''Thunderbolts Presents: Zemo - Born Better'' (2007), written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and drawn by [[Tom Grummett]], explores the history of the [[Zemo barony]]. Baron Helmut Zemo, sucked into the vacuum, wakes into medieval Germany (1503), witnessing Harbin Zemo's death and his succession, while in the present an academic called Wendell Volker and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] deduce that Helmut has traveled in time. Captured and taken prisoner as a [[leprosy|leper]], Helmut Zemo manages to inspire Harbin's twelve-year-old grandson Heller Zemo, to kill his father Hademar Zemo and fulfill his destiny as the third (and most enlightened and progressive) Baron Zemo. When Heller goes into the hidden cell to free his "muse", he discovers that Helmut has somehow disappeared. Helmut makes jumps to 1556 where he fights alongside Heller's son Herbert Zemo, later again to 1640 where he slays Herbert's son Helmuth Zemo, and later to 1710 where he narrowly escapes being killed by Helmuth's son Hackett Zemo.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

Meanwhile, in the present, Volker reveals that the Zemo bloodline isn't just limited to Helmut's immediate family but in fact Harbin's descendants are spread out all over the world. Wendell visits Miss Klein, a descendant of a bastard child of Hilliard Zemo, the eighth Baron Zemo and his Jewish lover Elsbeth Kleinenshvitz. Hilliard becomes baron after the death of his father Hartwig Zemo in the [[Seven Years' War]]. In the past Helmut sees Hilliard and Elsbeth in love, realizing that the residual energy of the Moonstone is drawing him into the present, but forcing him to stop and live every key moment of Zemo's lineage. Zemo manages to save Elsbeth, sentenced to death by the Diet because of her Jewish ancestry and her wealthy family, but in the present Volker kills her distant descendant, convinced that his actions can pull Zemo in his proper place into the time-stream.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

Helmut next ends up in 1879 where he stays for several weeks working his way up to be part of Hobart Zemo the tenth Baron Zemo's traveling guard. Hobart is killed during a civilian uprising shortly after German emperor William passes legislation to curb the socialist party. Helmut jumps forward in time before he can save Hobart his great-grandfather. Helmut next arrives during World War I during a battle between British forces led by the original [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] and German forces led by Helmut's grandfather Baron Herman Zemo (the 11th Baron Zemo). Helmut witnesses Herman's men slaughter the majority of the British forces with mustard gas. Later, Helmut goes with Herman and his men to find Castle Zemo has been reduced to rubble by the war. Helmut travels forward in time again to his father's tenure as a Nazi during World War Two.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

Back in the present, Wendell Volker discovers that Castle Zemo had been restored in the present. Wendell tours the castle with a local German police man and an Interpol agent named Herr Fleischtung, and then Wendell murders both men. Wendell has apparently murdered several Zemo relations in the belief that this spilling of Zemo blood would bring Helmut back to the present.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

After battling his own father in the past, giving him the inspiration to take up the Zemo mantle, Helmut returns to the present and manages to convince Wendell not to kill him as well, instead taking what is discovered to be his cousin under his wing, as he sets out to do something new for the world.{{issue|date=June 2013}}

Following the events of the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] crossover as seen in the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' storyline, Luke Cage assumed control over the Thunderbolts and had Fixer impersonate Zemo as a test to see which ones of his new teammates would betray the team if offered a chance to escape.<ref>''Thunderbolts #144-145</ref> Later on, it was revealed that Fixer was keeping in secret contact with Zemo while working on the raft.{{issue|date=February 2013}} During the ''Fear Itself'' event, Zemo gave Fixer key info on the mutant army threatening Chicago.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Having spent his time on the sidelines, watching Norman Osborn's rise to power with the intent of waiting to see what Norman would do with control over the Thunderbolts (and later SHIELD), Baron Zemo reappeared following the events of The Siege, when Osborn ultimately was defeated by the Avengers. A chance encounter at the Thunderbolts' former base in Colorado with the Ghost led to him learning that Bucky was still alive and was the new Captain America. Zemo confronted his rival Sin and discovered how Bucky had survived his father's death trap only to become a trained Soviet assassin (granted one under intense mind control) who killed scores of people for his Russian handlers. But most alarming as the fact that Zemo discovered that Captain America had not only forgiven his partner for his crimes, but had actively covered them up even after Bucky blew up a huge chunk of New York, killing several dozen SHIELD agents in order to restore power to a Cosmic Cube fragment.<ref>''Captain America'' #608</ref>

Baron Zemo recruited Jurgen "Iron-Handed" Hauptmann (of Red Skull's [[Exiles (Red Skull allies)|Exiles]]), as well as a new female version of the Beetle and Fixer to expose Bucky's sins to the world. This included drugging Bucky with nanites that caused him to behave irrationally and attack police officers and leaking to the media, not only detailed files revealing the acts of terrorism he committed as a mind-controlled pawn of the Russians, but video footage as well of him being trained by his handlers. Zemo ultimately kidnapped Bucky and took him to his father's island where Bucky originally "died". There Zemo confessed that he did what he did, not out of a desire to finish the job his father started, but out of jealousy over how Captain America and his allies quickly forgave Bucky for his crimes, yet continue to scorn Zemo, who had reformed and saved the world on numerous occasions.<ref>''Captain America'' #608-6012</ref> Zemo then forced Bucky into a similar deathtrap as the one his father put Bucky in, modified though in order to allow Bucky a chance to escape. Zemo then escaped from the island unharmed.<ref>''Captain America'' #609-612</ref>
