'''General John Ryker''' is a [[fictional character]], an enemy of the [[Hulk]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is obsessed with the Hulk, and tried to make attempts to capture the creature.

==Fictional character biography==
Ryker joined the military at the young age and wanted to help determine future history from his shadows. One of his most prominent actions was manipulating the creation of the conspiracy around the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]]; apparently Kennedy was really killed by two Austrian mercenaries, but at the time it was deemed too expensive to wage World War Three so the idea of a conspiracy was created. When his wife Lucy developed cancer, Ryker used the military to hunt down Bruce Banner, who turned into the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after exposure from gamma radiation during a nuclear test that Ryker supervised. Initially, Ryker irradiated various subjects to try and duplicate the accident that created the Hulk, thus allowing him to isolate the Hulk's ability to cope with the radiation and use it to heal his wife. His closest success was Private Benjamin Tibbits, who mutated into the Hulk-like [[Flux (comics)|Flux]], but his transformation was imperfect, leading to Ryker simply breaking him to use as a near-mindless soldier against the Hulk. 

However, his brutal treatment of the Hulk, having finally captured the Green Goliath, not only broke down the mental barriers keeping the Hulk's other personalities from taking control- including the [[Hulk (comics)#Devil Hulk|Devil Hulk]]-, but also convinced General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] to turn against Ryker and free his long-time enemy. Taking Lucy Ryker hostage, Ross told her the truth, prompting Ryker to depart as she coldly told him that she didn't ask to be healed at the cost of innocent people. 

He is responsible for the creation of the [[Gamma Corps]], a special military unit created specifically to deal with the Hulk. He was spurred into action after his wife, who seemed to have been cured by a transfusion of Hulk blood, died from a sudden revival of her cancer.
The Corps were unable to stop the Hulk, who went after Ryker, and caused Gamma Corps member Grey, who had Hulk DNA in him, to lose his temper, resulting in a Hulk-like rage that tore down Ryker's base, with the General still inside.

==Powers and abilities==
Ryker is a military strategist.  He manipulates people and situations to get what he wants.  At these situations, Ryker is making sure that he stays in the shadows and very few people know about his existence.

==In other media==
In [[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)| Fantastic Four]] Episode [[Hard Knocks (Fantastic Four episode)| Hard Knocks]] Ryker is the leader of the group of soldiers hunting the Hulk.
 
In the ''[[Hulk (video game)|Hulk]]'' video game, General Ryker made an appearance.  In the game, he sends out the military to capture the Hulk so that he might be able to study him.  Also, he only appears in the cutscenes of the game.  When discovering the gamma orb, Ryker plans to get it for his own purposes, but [[Ravage (Marvel Comics)|Ravage]] gets the orb.  Ryker decided to kill both the Hulk and Ravage.  He also had the [[Hulkbusters]] to fight the Hulk.

In this game, Ryker was voiced by Jano Frandsen.
