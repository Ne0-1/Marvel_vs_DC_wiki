'''Nomad''' is the name of a number of [[superhero]] characters who have appeared in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The Nomad identity was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], debuting in ''[[Captain America]]'' #180 ([[December]] [[1974]]. The identity was revived for a minor character in ''Captain America'' #261-262 ([[1981]]), in a story written by [[John Marc DeMatteis]], who apparently liked the concept enough to give it a more permanent use after ''Captain America'' #281 ([[May]] [[1983]]).

The first '''Nomad''' was an alternate identity conceived by Steve Rogers, better known as the original Captain America.

Rogers became disillusioned with the [[United States|US]] government when he discovered that a high ranking government official (heavily hinted to be the then [[President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]]) was the leader of the terrorist organisation known as the [[Secret Empire]].

Rogers then decided to abandon his patriotic Captain America identity in favour of the Nomad name (as it means "man without a country") adopting a new dark blue and yellow uniform with no patriotic markings on it at all.

This identity was shortlived, Rogers maintaining it for a mere four issues of the comic, and he quickly returned to the role of Captain America.

==Edward Felber==

The second '''Nomad''' was Edward Felber, a shortlived character who was given the Nomad's costume and equipment by the [[Red Skull]], who killed him soon after.

==Jack Monroe==
The third '''Nomad''' is Jack Monroe, the most famous bearer of the name. Monroe first became a super-hero as a teenager in the [[1950s]], when he became the third person to assume the role of [[Bucky (comics)|Bucky]], battling [[communist]]s opposite the fourth Captain America.

The two had gained super-powers by injecting themselves with a "Super-Soldier Formula" that they had found in old [[Nazi]] files, and though the formula initially granted them abilities similar to those of the original Captain America (Steve Rogers) its effects eventually gave them psychotic symptoms. As a result the two were arrested and put into [[suspended animation]] by government agents.

Reawakaned decades later, Monroe, in his identity as Bucky, tried to kill the real Captain and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but was captured and his custody given to the psychologist [[Dr. Faustus]].  Faustus mind-controlled the replacement Cap and Bucky in order to use them against Steve Rogers, but the ersatz Captain was killed in the conflict and Monroe turned over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

Seemingly cured by the spy agency, Monroe sought out Steve Rogers, who then gave him his former Nomad identity, with which Monroe helped Cap defeat the female terrorist known as [[Viper (comics)|Viper]].  Nomad then became Captain America's partner for a time, helping him defeat the Red Skull and [[Baron Zemo]] (a conflict in which the Red Skull seemingly perished), but after apprehending the deranged [[Madcap]] on his own, Nomad ended the partnership.

After a few months dismantling the [[Slug (comics)|Slug]]'s criminal empire, the Nomad came back into Captain America's fold when Rogers was stripped of his identity by the [[Commission for Superhuman Activities]].  When Rogers regained his identity, Monroe was once again involved with a drug dealer.  Discarding his spandex outfit, he chose to become an urban vigilante, and kidnapped an infant girl from her drug addicted mother, naming her Bucky.  The Commission, allied with the military, tried to arrest him and the Nomad was forced to kill some of them to escape.  He later moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] and became loosely affiliated with the Undergrounders, a network of prostitutes, petty thieves and con-artists.

The Nomad spent some time on the road, dealing with problems not usually the pervue of superheroes, such as [[AIDS]], [[homelessness]], and [[hate crime]]s.  One of the stories, written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], dealt with the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].  Later, he was believed dead in a confrontation with his old hometown's nazi militia (Monroe's father had been a nazi sympathizer during World War II), but was in fact placed in suspended animation and later used by [[Henry Gyrich]] against the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], after Gyrich brainwashed him and turned him into [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]]. As Scourge he battled the Thunderbolts, who eventually freed him from Gyrich's control.

Returning to his Nomad identity, Monroe began to relapse into some psychotic episodes and symptoms which were possibly exercabated by the influence of the reconstituted [[Cosmic Cube]] and the mysterious [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]]. Monroe was shot dead by the Winter Soldier in ''Captain America'' vol.5 #3 ([[April]] [[2005]]).
