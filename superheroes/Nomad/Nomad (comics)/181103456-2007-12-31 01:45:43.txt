'''Nomad''' is the name of a number of [[superhero]] characters who have appeared in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Nomad name and costume was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]] as an alternate identity for the original [[Captain America]], Steve Rogers, in ''Captain America'' #180 (December, [[1974]]).

The identity was revived by writer [[John Marc DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]] for a minor character, ("Edward Felber"), in ''Captain America'' #261-263 (September - November, [[1981]]). The same writer later gave the title to its best known claimant ("Jack Monroe") in ''Captain America'' #281 (May, [[1983]]). 

==Steve Rogers==

{{Main|Captain America}}
The original '''Nomad''' is an alternate identity which Steve Rogers adopts after he abandons the Captain America costume and title. 

In ''Captain America'' #180 (December, 1974) Rogers becomes disillusioned with the [[United States|U.S.]] government when he discovers that a high ranking government official (heavily hinted to be the then [[President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]]) is the leader of the terrorist organization known as the [[Secret Empire]]. 

Rogers then decides to abandon his Captain America identity, feeling that he cannot continue to serve America after this latest discovery has shattered his faith in the nation's status. However, a confrontation with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] (Disguised as the [[Golden Archer]]) forces Rogers to realise that he cannot abandon a life of heroism, and he susbequently takes on the name "Nomad" (as it means "man without a country") adopting a new dark blue and yellow uniform with no patriotic markings on it at all.

This identity is short-lived, with Rogers maintaining it for a mere four issues of the comic to varying degrees of success; he even trips over his own cape at one point. At the conclusions of ''Captain America'' #184 (April, 1975) in which he returns to the role of Captain America when he realizes that he could champion America's ideals without blindly supporting its government.

==Edward Ferbel==
Introduced in ''Captain America'' #261 (September, 1981), the second '''Nomad''' was Edward Ferbel, a short-lived character who is given the Nomad's costume and equipment by the [[Red Skull]] in an effort to discredit Captain America. 

He is killed by an agent of the Skull, the "[[Ameridroid]]", in ''Captain America'' #263 (November, 1981). [http://www.marvunapp.com/master/njnor.htm]

==Jack Monroe==
The third and best known '''Nomad''' is Jack Monroe, who was formerly known as the third [[Bucky]]. He was created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema in ''Captain America'' #153 (September, 1972). 

A character with a complicated history, Monroe's origin involves a complex series of [[retcon]]s (a comic book term for changes to previously established [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]). Although the character's first real appearance is as "Bucky" in ''Captain America'' #153, the origin of the character, first revealed in ''Captain America'' #155 (again by Englehart and Buscema), identifies him as the "Bucky" that appeared in ''Captain America'' comics which were originally published in the 1950s. 

When they were first published between 1953 and 1954 those ''Captain America'' stories, which were written by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[Mort Lawrence]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]], starred Steve Rogers (the original Captain America) and Bucky and were clearly set in the 1950s, with the duo prominently battling communism and a communist Red Skull. However, when Lee revived the Captain America concept a second time in 1964 he ignored his own previous stories. The character returned in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #4 (March, 1964) in which it is revealed that the original Captain America has been in a state of [[suspended animation]] since a battle he fought near the close of [[World War II]]. The story also reveals that the original Bucky apparently perished in that battle. 

The 1950s stories were thus considered outside of official canon until Englehart's 1972 ''Captain America'' storyline (#153-156; September - December, 1972), which attempted to resolve the discrepancy by showing how a teenager (Monroe is simply referred to as "Bucky" throughout, the name "Jack Monroe" was introduced in later stories) and an [[Grand Director|unnamed man]] (later known as "The Grand Director") had assumed both the public and private identities of the original Captain America and Bucky as part of a government-sponsored program which planned to replace the lost heroes to combat the "red threat". 

The origin story of the two characters is given in ''Captain America'' #155, which reveals  how the two gain super-powers by injecting themselves with a "Super-Soldier Formula" that they find in old [[Nazism|Nazi]] files. The formula initially grants them abilities similar to those of the original Captain America (Steve Rogers).  However, the formula made no mention of the essential Vita-ray exposure portion of the treatment and the absence causes its effects to eventually give them psychotic symptoms. As a result, the two are arrested and put into suspended animation by government agents. 

This complicated origin is the reason that some sources list ''Young Men'' #24 (December, 1953; the first appearance of the communist hunting Captain America and Bucky) as Monroe's first appearance, though in actuality the issue in question was originally intended to depict the original Bucky. A later story, ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' Vol. 1 #4, (August, 1977), further complicates the Bucky history by introducing another "Bucky" (Fred Davis) that takes on the role in 1945, many years before Monroe assumes the title, which makes Monroe the third "Bucky" chronologically. 
 
In ''Captain America'' #153-156 "Bucky" and his partner are reawakened decades after being put in suspended animation. In their delusional state, the man and teenager who were the 1950s Captain America and Bucky attempt to kill the original Captain and his partner the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. However they are eventually captured and returned to a state of suspended animation.

In ''Captain America'' #232- 236 (April - August, 1979) - by writers [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]], [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Michael Fleisher]] and artist Sal Buscema, "Captain America" is revived and brainwashed by the psychologist [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]] into becoming the fascistic "Grand Director", leader of the [[National Force]]. Under Faustus' control "The Grand Director" shoots and apparently kills his former partner Bucky. At the storyline's conclusion Faustus and The Director are defeated by the original Captain America and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] after which The Grand Director commits suicide.

Writer J.M. DeMatteis resurrected the "Bucky" character in ''Captain America'' #281 (May, 1983), which is the first comic that names him as "Jack Monroe". That story reveals Faustus had loaded the gun with blanks as he intended to use Monroe in a later plot which was never realized. Monroe, it is revealed, had subsequently gone into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody and seemingly been cured of his psychotic symptoms. In the story the cured Monroe seeks out Steve Rogers, who then gives him his former Nomad identity in ''Captain America'' #282 (June, 1983) after Monroe helps him defeat the female terrorist known as [[Viper (comics)|Viper]]. 

Nomad then becomes Captain America's partner for the next two years of published comics, most notably helping him defeat the Red Skull and [[Baron Zemo]] in DeMatteis' last storyline, a conflict in which the Red Skull seemingly perished (''Captain America'' #298 - 300; October - December 1984). DeMatteis' successor as writer of the series, [[Mark Gruenwald]], had Nomad end the partnership in ''Captain America'' #309 (September, 1985), after the character completes a successful solo mission apprehending the deranged [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]. 
 
However Gruenwald continued to feature the character in ''Captain America'' intermittently. In ''Captain America'' #324 -325 (December, 1986 - January, 1987) Nomad is shown dismantling the [[Slug (comics)|Slug]]'s criminal empire. Monroe returns again in ''Captain America'' #336 (December, 1987) after Steve Rogers is stripped of the Captain America identity by the [[Commission for Superhuman Activities]]. In a storyline which continues for over a year of ''Captain America'' stories (#336-350; December, 1987 - February, 1989) Rogers continues being a superhero under the identity of "The Captain" and, wearing a black version of his regular costume, he begins traveling the country fighting evil with a group of his former partners, including Nomad, [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]] and [[Falcon (comics)|The Falcon]]. The group also includes Nomad's then-girlfriend, a neophyte adventurer who goes by the codename [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]]. During this storyline Nomad is depicted as a tetchy and insolent character who takes an instant disliking to Demolition Man, a dislike which only increases when it becomes evident that Vagabond and Demolition Man are attracted to each other. 

Nomad's membership of The Captain's group comes to an end after an episode involving the [[Serpent Society]] (''Captain America'' #342; June, 1988). When a faction of the Society under the leadership of the terrorist known as [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] attempts to poison the [[Washington, DC]] water supply, The Captain and his team intervenes.  During these events, Nomad, Vagabond, and Demolition Man are captured by The Commission and held in jail. The former Serpent Society leader known as [[Sidewinder]] uses his teleportation ability to enter the jail and free [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], a Society member who has remained loyal to Sidewinder and helped The Captain fight Viper, and as a result was in jail, too. Sidewinder offers to free the other heroes imprisoned there, but Vagabond and Demolition Man turn him down, saying that they think it was wrong to flee the authorities. Nomad scoffs at this notion, and decides to leave the jail with Sidewinder and Diamondback. This incident ends his relationship with Vagabond. In ''Captain America'' #345 (September, 1988), the Captain approaches Nomad for help, but finds Nomad in a bar, drunk.  Upon finding out Rogers plans to give himself up to the Commission, Nomad refuses to help him and the two men part on bad terms. 
 
The character is next seen in the eight page story "Angel in the snow" in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #14 (March, 1989), which was written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], a writer who would go on to script most of the characters appearances in the following decade and a half. The story is followed up in a back up story in ''Captain America Annual'' #9 (1989), again written by Nicieza, in which Monroe discards his spandex outfit choosing to become an urban [[vigilante]]. 

In 1990, Nomad starred in an eponymous four-issue miniseries, written by Nicieza and penciled by [[James Fry III]] (November 1990 - February, 1991). In the story, Monroe kidnaps an infant girl from her drug addicted mother, naming her "Bucky". The Commission, allied with the military, sends Steve Rogers (by now restored to the Captain America role) to try and subdue Nomad and in a subsequent firefight Nomad kills several drug dealers and government officials. 

A Nomad ongoing series was launched in 1992. Again written by Nicieza the series lasted 25 issues (May, 1992 - May, 1994) and featured artwork from several artists most notably [[Pat Olliffe]]. In the series Nomad spends some time on the road, dealing with problems not usually the purview of superheroes, such as [[AIDS]], [[homelessness]], and [[hate crime]]s. 

At one point in the series Monroe spends an extended period in [[Los Angeles, California]] and in one issue (#9; January, 1993) Nicieza addresses the subject of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] which had recently occurred when the story was first published. While in L.A. Nomad becomes loosely affiliated with the "Undergrounders", a network of people across America who willingly help each other out in need. This allows Nomad access to trusted babysitters when he needs to enter situations far, far too dangerous for Bucky (though many think Nomad's life is consistently far too dangerous). During this phase of his life, Nomad sheds much of his previous acerbic, self-destructive personality, and becomes a more laid-back, compassionate person. Later in the series Nomad realizes that both he and/or Bucky could be infected with HIV, Bucky due to her parentage and Nomad due to his time receiving medical care from the Undergrounders.  He has himself and Bucky tested but it is never revealed if either of them are infected. 

One notable storyline in the title, ("[[Dead Man's Hand (comics)|Dead Man's Hand]]" a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with the ''[[Punisher]] War Journal'' and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' series also being published at that time), sees Nomad teaming up with the Punisher, Daredevil and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] against a coalition of criminal organizations. The title was also involved in the 1993 ''[[Infinity Crusade]]'' crossover, in which Nomad is shown among dozens of super-heroes who travel into outer space. Nomad doesn't do much in the series as he and [[Forge]] literally hang around for much of the story. In his own series, Nomad confronts an evil clone of [[Gambit]], who had gotten lost on the way to the battles. 
 
During his time on the road, Nomad confronts the Hate-Monger, Man-Thing and even the mother of Bucky herself, who had been brainwashed into a trained assassin sent to kill him.

At the close of the ''Nomad'' ongoing series the character is believed dead after a confrontation with his old hometown's Nazi militia (Monroe's father had been a Nazi sympathizer during World War II) but he had been placed in suspended animation. An innocent bystander's body was used to replace his. 

In ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #49 (April, 2001) it was revealed that he was in fact placed in suspended animation and later revived by [[Henry Gyrich]] who brainwashed him and turned him into a new version of the [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]] character. As "Scourge", he battled the Thunderbolts, who eventually freed him from Gyrich's control (''Thunderbolts'' #34-50; March, 2000 - May, 2001).  

Monroe is next shown  by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Steve Epting]] in ''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #3 (April [[2005]]) being shot dead by a mysterious assailant as he leaves a bar. ''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #7 (July, 2005) by Brubaker and artist [[John Paul Leon]] then recounts the events of the last few days of his life. In the story Monroe returns to his original Nomad costume and identity and begins to relapse into some psychotic episodes and symptoms. The original [[Bucky]], now the cyborg "[[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]]", is ultimately revealed to be Monroe's assassin.

===Powers and abilities===
Monroe was mostly portrayed as essentially having the same powers as the first official Captain America, Steve Rogers I.  This has long been a matter of contention in the comics as Monroe received his powers from the same sample of the Super-Soldier Serum that gave Steve Rogers II (Captain America of the 1950s, later the [[Grand Director]]) definite super-human strength.  He became super strong but after being exposed to stabilizing rays (similar to the Vita-rays Steve Rogers I received) his strength normalized to peak human.

While Monroe's strength, endurance, reflexes, and agility were not beyond the limits of the human body, they were superior to that of any Olympic athlete who ever competed. Unfortunately, as a result of not going through the Vita-Ray process Monroe's transformation eventually drove him insane and gave him a form of cancer.

As Nomad, he wore a pair of stun-discs on each shoulder near the collarbone.  These discs could be thrown as projectile weapons.
