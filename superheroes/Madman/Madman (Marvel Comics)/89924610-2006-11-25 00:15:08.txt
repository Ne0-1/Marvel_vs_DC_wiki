Calling himself Madman, Sterns hatches a plot to kill the Hulk, poisoning him and putting him in conflict with various members of his rogues gallery, most notably the [[Abomination]].  The Leader, Madman's brother, comes to the Hulk's aid and helps him track down Madman/cure the poisoning.  He explains that Madman "scares him".
