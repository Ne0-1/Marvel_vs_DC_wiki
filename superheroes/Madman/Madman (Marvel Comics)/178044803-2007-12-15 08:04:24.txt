'''Madman''' ('''Philip Sterns''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is one of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk's]] enemies, and is the brother of [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]], better known as the[[Leader (comics)|The Leader]].  He first appeared as Philip Sterns in ''Incredible Hulk'' #363 (December 1989), and as Madman in ''Incredible Hulk'' #364.

==Fictional character biography==

A former schoolmate of Bruce Banner, Sterns develops a deranged love/obsession with Banner's "career" as the Hulk.  Sterns subjects himself to a multitude of weird experiments involving gamma-radiation so as to emulate his "hero", this results in Sterns turning into a distorted shapeshifting monstrosity possessed of vast superhuman strength, and develops a much stronger completely deranged personality, giving him ‘orders’ to carry out.

Calling himself Madman, Sterns hatches a plot to kill the Hulk, giving him a swiftly deteriorating poison injection and putting him in conflict with various members of his rogues’ gallery, most notably the [[Abomination]], turning weaker and more emaciated for every battle.  The Leader, Madman's brother, comes to the Hulk's aid and helps him track down Madman to find the antidote.  He explains that Madman "scares him", but can’t force himself to kill his brother.  During the ensuing battle, Madman suffers a psychological breakdown, completely submerging his original personality, and Hulk manages to cure himself, as well as poison Madman, leaving the latter on the verge of death, with the remedy dropped barely out of reach.<ref name="IH367">’’Incredible Hulk’’ vol.2, #367</ref>

Later Madman is revealed to simply have increased his mass to grab it, and used the time to masquerade as a researcher in the [[Red Skull|Red Skull's]] "New World Order" organisation, helping to engineer the transformation of a captured [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent into the power-mimicking creature known as [[Piecemeal]], and having installed a safety override, making it answerable only to himself.<ref name="IH408">’’Incredible Hulk’’ vol.2, #408</ref>

When tracking the creature he found it in confrontation with the Hulk in the vicinity of Loch Ness, and took advantage of the opportunity to knock out his enemy from behind. He dumps the Hulk into the lake saddled with iron weights, but is disappointed when the latter takes 2 minutes longer than expected to escape. During the ensuing gang-up Madman continues to make disorderly deranged remarks and indifferently kills Perseus, a retired Pantheon member the Hulk was visiting, when the latter tries to intervene, and simply enjoys the flight as a raging Hulk punches him away.<ref>’’Incredible Hulk’’ vol.2, #407-#408</ref>

While the Hulk seemingly kills Piecemeal, Madman decides to take off in a stolen jet, since he's now decided that skulking is boring, and wants flunkies to do his bidding instead. He's annoyed when Hulk overtakes and starts to dismantle the jet, since he was interrupted in an internal monologue, triggers a pilot-chair parachute, remarking that he's not interested in killing Hulk, since it would be dull to not annoy him anymore, and detonates the plane.

After landing in London he immediately holds the British [[prince Charles]] hostage on top of [[Buckingham Palace]] and demands to be declared king of England. As Hulk comes to the rescue, Madman states that the latter should understand the demands to use great power and shifts from crying to irreverently upbeat within seconds, dropping the crown prince towards the ground. While throwing a temper tantrum about everybody "ganging up on him" due to not allowing him to rule them as a tyrant, the Hulk catches up to, and manages to knock him to the ground. Madman once again voices his "love"/admiration for Hulk/Banner, but takes the opportunity to escape as the [[London Bridge]] collapses underneath them. Hulk notes that the local slow-witted hero [[Killpower]] must be joking. when the latter assumes that the Madman might have died.<ref name="IH409">’’Incredible Hulk’’ vol.2, #409</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like the Hulk, Madman has vast superhuman strength. Unlike the Hulk, Madman is unable to become stronger as he becomes angrier, but he is capable of creating significant boosts in his size, density and power, making him greatly exceed the Hulk's calm state for brief periods of time. Allegedly being at least twice as strong as the base level of the 'merged'/'professor' incarnation in this mode, and once knocked out the latter with a single punch to the head through the advantage of surprise.<ref name="IH407">’’Incredible Hulk’’ vol.2, #407</ref> He has also claimed to be able to assume many different appearances, including the scientist spying on the "New World Order".<ref name="IH408">’’Incredible Hulk’’ vol.2, #408</ref>

== Other media ==
In [[Hulk (video game)|The Hulk video game]], Madman appears as one of the major bosses. He works with his brother, The Leader, to create a world ruled by gamma creatures. Madman first appears kidnapping [[Betty Ross]], and putting her in a gamma chanber. The Hulk comes to rescue Betty and battle him. He returns near the end of the game, in the Leader's base, and teams up with [[Halflife (comics)|Halflife]] to kill Bruce Banner. However, Banner turns into the Hulk, and battles the duo. Madman flees in the middle of the boss fight, leaving Halflife at the mercy of the Hulk. When the base is collapsing, he tries to battle the Hulk one more time. He is killed in the final fight, after the Leader's base was destroyed, and he was left behind.

He was voiced by [[Paul Dobson]].
