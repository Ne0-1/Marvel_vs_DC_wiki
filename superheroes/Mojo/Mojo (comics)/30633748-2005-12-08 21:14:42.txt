'''Mojo''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Arthur Adams]]. His first appearance was in Longshot #3 (November, 1985).
==Character biography==
Part of a race of spineless beings, Mojo's race did not [[evolution|evolve]] much because of their inability to stand upright until scientist Arize developed exoskeletons that allowed a fast evolution. However, some members of the race refused to use them and called themselves the Spineless Ones. Instead, they used flying platforms to transport their bodies. They also became the rulers and demanded a race of [[Slavery|slave]]s to do all the tasks they could not or would not do. Arize created humanoid beings using genetic engineering. Unknown to the Spineless Ones, he secretly planted the seeds in their genetic make-up to eventually turn on their masters and rule Mojo-world justly.

The power structure of this world was based on the [[television]] industry and Mojo became their leader by controlling it, along with the slave trade. Mojo named the world after himself; 'Mojo World'.

One of the slaves he had ordered, [[Longshot]], became one of his best stunt performers. However, Longshot disagreed with the rules and led a rebellion. He was captured and had his memories removed, but managed to escape to earth, where he joined the [[X-Men]]. Mojo had Longshot's girlfriend transformed into an assassin named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] to kill him, but she did not succeed despite Mojo's personal help. 

During his trip to earth, Mojo found out that the adventures of the X-Men shot the audience level to top ratings; which increases his political power. Hence, he kidnapped [[Psylocke]] and replaced her lost eyes with video cameras which transmitted to Mojo World all she saw. Once more blessed with sight, Psylocke had not the nerve to remove her new eyes and she kept transmitting to Mojo's World until the X-Men were presumedly killed by the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]]. 

Trying to gain the audience once more, Mojo also kidnapped the X-Men member [[Rachel Summers]], but she escaped. Mojo wanted to have footage of the X-Men to improve his ratings, but he didn't want risk being ousted from his political position or destroyed by them so his assistant came up with a possible solution; create smaller versions that could be controlled. Then he ordered the creation of the [[X-Babies]], but they also rebelled. 

Eventually, Longshot returned to free the slaves and deposed Mojo, with the help of Mojo's clone '''Mojo II'''. However, Mojo II turned out to be just as bad as his predecessor and Longshot had to defeat him as well. After Mojo II was ousted Mojo reclaimed his position and became the leader of Mojo World once more.

Mojo never learned from his mistake concerning the X-babies and would create more X-Babies, who also rebelled. Eventually all of the X-Men had X-Baby counterparts on Mojo-world, and they all rebelled against Mojo and fled to an area he could not reach. He also created the [[Mighty 'Vengers]] (child versions of the Avengers) to finally stop the X-Babies once and for all. Of course, the Mighty 'Vengers, being essentially of the same moral fabric as their adult counterparts, turned on Mojo and defeated him. Finally, he created toddler versions of all of the Marvel supervillains. These characters are still employed by him although some of them were more intelligent and may even compete with him for dominance of Mojo-world.

==Powers and abilities==
Mojo's flying platform is armed with various particle beam weapons. It also has a large artificial appendage that can be used as an arm or a slicing weapon. He is strong enough to hold a human off of the ground with one arm easily. He has several powers derived from magic, including the projection of magical energy blasts. 

==Ultimate Mojo==
In the series ''[[Ultimate X-Men]],'' set outside the ordinary [[Marvel Universe|Marvel continuity]], Mojo is not an alien but an ordinary human being. He is a well-dressed, overweight, [[albino]] television producer. He trapped a young mutant fugative [[Longshot]] on an island where humans hunt him as part of a popular [[reality show]]. In this series, Mojo's full name is '''Mojo Adams,''' a tribute to his creator [[Art Adams]].
