'''Lotus Shinchuko''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Lotus Shinchuko mysteriously appeared just in time to assist the [[Sons of the Tiger]] in defeating the [[Silent Ones]], who had killed their sensei.  She explained to them that she had been enslaved to the Silent Ones, but broke free of their control to help the Sons.  She renounced the Silent Ones and joined with the Sons of the Tiger, settling with them in New York City.  Lotus became romantically involved with one of their members, [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Bob Diamond]].  While on an evening stroll through [[Central Park]] with Bob, Lotus still proved to be under the Silent Ones’ control when she suddenly attacked him. The other Sons intervened, and [[Sun Lin]] was able to discover a device attached to her neck controlling her, and removed it.

After a while, Lotus began to draw away from Bob Diamond and became closer to Sun Lin. This angered Bob, and the Sons broke out into a fight. The group broke up, and Bob left the team to become an actor.  Lotus remained with Sun Lin and [[Abe Brown]], maintaining the Sons’ martial arts school.
