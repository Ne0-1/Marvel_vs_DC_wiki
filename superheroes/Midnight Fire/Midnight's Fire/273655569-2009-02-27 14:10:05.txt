'''Midnight's Fire''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He first appeared in ''[[New Warriors]]'' (vol. 1) #2, (August 1990), and was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Mark Bagley]]. Midnight's Fire is a Mutate, his powers and his sister [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]]'s powers are derived from their ability to tap into the extradimensional energy of the ''Universal Wellspring'', due to exposure to the mutagenic properties of the "Well of All Things" while in the womb.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
In 1966 during the [[Vietnam War]], an American recon patrol in [[Cambodia]] stumbled upon the ancient, hidden [[temple]] of a cult known as the '''Dragon's Breadth''', which had remained hidden for centuries. It had been built upon a well-spring of raw, primal energy called the "Well of All Things". The inhabitants decided to breed a superior race that would one day unite with the ways of the west. They believed that this union would produce children capable of harnessing the power of the Well. The members of the recon patrol were to be the fathers of these children, one of these men was Andrew Chord the man who would become Midnight Fire's father.[http://members.fortunecity.com/jsc2593/circle.html]

===Silhouette===
Midnight's Fire and his sister [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]] are the only children of [[Andrew Chord]] former guardian of '''Dwayne Taylor''' ([[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]]) and his wife Miyami (daughter of [[Tai (comics)|Tai]]). Silhouette and Midnight's Fire were operating as independent vigilantes in the streets of [[New York City]] when they met Dwayne before he became Night Thrasher, and the three began an organized effort to take down various New York City [[street gangs]].

===Breakdowns===
Their partnership ended when '''Silhouette''' was shot and paralyzed from the legs down in a sting gone bad. Midnight's Fire blamed Dwayne and became a [[cop killer]] and a [[druglord]] in order to lure Dwayne into a physical confrontation he could not possibly win. Later the partially paralyzed Silhouette reunited with Dwayne, distancing herself from her brother's evil actions. [http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2855/silhouette.html]

===Folding Circle===
Diego Cassias, one of the other members of the recon patrol now calling himself the [[Left Hand (comics)|Left Hand]], stole the power of the Well from his own child, then gathered the other children of the pact including Midnight's Fire into a group called the '''Folding Circle'''. The Circle attempted to take control of the Well away from Tai. Members of the Circle, together with the New Warriors, managed to defeat Tai, but the Well was sealed, Cassias and Tai were apparently killed, and the surviving members of the Circle escaped in a stolen Avenger's Quinjet.[http://members.fortunecity.com/jsc2593/circle.html] 

The remaining members of the Folding Circle later crashed in [[Madripoor]] and attempted to usurp the role of local druglord, which was then held by Aardwolf, a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|Mutant]] crimelord. They succeeded, but were later taken down by Night Thrasher and Silhouette.[http://members.fortunecity.com/jsc2593/circle.html]

===Universal Wellspring===
Midnight's Fire is a [[Mutate (comics)|Mutate]] like his sister [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]]. His powers come from the Universal Wellspring as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #107.

===New Warriors Volume 4===
Recently Midnight's Fire returned in Issues 7-8 of New Warriors Vol. 4, called into have a face to face meeting with Night Thrasher, whom he still believes is Dwayne but is in fact Donyell, for the purposes of arranging an 'alliance'. Midnight's Fire leaves, telling Night Thrasher he would think about it. It's after the meeting that Midnight's Fire is working on behalf of another individual, one which he may not like at all given his expression at the end of the issue but has no choice. Who this individual is and what his or her motives are, are currently unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
*Midnight's Fire has very subtle abilities, due to the energies of the ''Well of All Things'' his physical attributes are at the peak of human possibility, he has enhanced speed, strength, agility, and sensory perception on par with [[Captain America]]. 
*He is also an unparalleled [[martial artist]]. The combination of these traits made him a deadly threat in combat to normal humans like Night Thrasher. The threat of a physical confrontation with Midnight's Fire was one of the main reasons that Dwayne Taylor created his body armor.
