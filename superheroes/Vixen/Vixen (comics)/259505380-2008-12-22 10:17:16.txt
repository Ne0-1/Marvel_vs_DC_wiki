'''Vixen''' ('''Mari Jiwe McCabe''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  She was nearly the first [[black people|black]] female DC superhero to star in her own series, but the first issue of her series was canceled in the [[DC Implosion]] in 1978, never to be released (it was subsequently printed in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'').  Her first appearance distributed to the public was in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #521 (1981).

==Publication history==
{{Expand|date=September 2008}}

In October 2008, [[G. Willow Wilson]] began new five-issue [[limited series]], ''Vixen: Return of the Lion''.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080821-WillowWilson.html Talking to G. Willow Wilson - Air, Vixen and More], [[Newsarama]], August 29, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18001 G.

==Fictional character biography==
In ancient [[Africa]], there was a legend that the warrior Tantu asked [[Anansi]] the Spider to create a totem that would give the wearer all of the powers of the animal kingdom, if they would use the power to protect the innocent.  As shown in the pages of ''[[Animal Man]]'', it is possible that the "Anansi" who Tantu met, may have been a member of the alien race who gave Buddy Baker the ability to "tap the morphogenetic field" — or, as shown in the pages of ''[[Justice League]]'', the aliens may have been Anansi in disguise.  This field allows Buddy to imitate the abilities of nearby animals.  According to the ''Animal Man'' series, Mari's Tantu [[totem]] may tap into that same field.  Tantu used the totem to become Africa's first legendary hero.  The totem was later passed down to Tantu's descendants until it reached the McCabes.

Growing up in a small African village in the fictional nation of [[M'Changa]], '''Mari Jiwe McCabe''' hears the legend of the "Tantu Totem" from her mother.  Sometime later, Mari's mother is killed by poachers and she is raised by her father Reverend Richard Jiwe, the village priest.  Reverend Jiwe himself is killed by his half-brother (Mari's uncle) General Maksai.  Maksai wants the Tantu Totem, which Jiwe had been in possession of.

She moves to America, where she establishes an identity as Mari McCabe and gets a job as a model in [[New York City]].  She uses her newfound wealth to travel the world.  On a trip back to Africa, she comes across her uncle and takes back the Tantu Totem, using its power to become the costumed superhero '''Vixen'''.

===Fighting Crime===

After this, Vixen made only two appearances as a solo crime fighter: once fighting poachers in India<ref name="Action Comics #521">''Action Comics'' #521</ref> and then against the techno-psycho criminal, Admiral Cerebrus.<ref>''DC Comics Presents'' #68</ref>  In fact, she was a reluctant hero until the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] was reorganized by [[Aquaman]].  She applies for full-time League membership and is accepted.<ref>''Justice League of America Annual'' #2</ref>  During her time with the JLA, the totem is taken from her by General Maksai, who still sought its power.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #234-235</ref>  The totem would only grant its full power to those who would use it to protect the innocent, and it causes Maksai to be transformed into a raging beast.  Maksai dies in battle with Vixen.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #239</ref>  Vixen continues with that particular incarnation of the JLA until two members were killed, [[Commander_Steel#Hank_Heywood_III|Steel]] and [[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]], and it was disbanded by the [[Martian Manhunter]].<ref>''Justice League of America #261</ref>

Around this time, Vixen teams up with [[Animal Man]] again.  She travels to his suburban house with knowledge of a mysterious murderous force.  Animal Man's own powers have become affected because of this force, as he finds himself unable to correctly access the right powers.

===Suicide Squad===
{{main|Suicide Squad}}
Vixen returns to modeling; but a Caribbean photo session turned violent.  Mari's colleagues were killed by drug smugglers.  She appeals to the government, who turn the matter over to the Suicide Squad. She goes undercover to capture the drug kingpin Cujo, who had been revealed by footage shot during the shoot.  Along with [[Captain Boomerang]] and [[Black Orchid]], she destroys the operation, but not before she loses control and kills the criminal kingpin, too.  Revolted by what she had become, she agrees to work with the Squad until her animal instincts could be curbed.<ref>As seen in ''Suicide Squad'' #11-12</ref>  She works with the Squad for some time, again seeing more teammates and friends killed.  When it was disbanded for a year, Mari returns to modeling and even launches a successful line of clothing.  Her failed romance with Ben Turner (the [[Bronze Tiger]]) makes Vixen decline an offer to rejoin the Squad.  She realizes Turner needs mental support; she reluctantly returns and serves through the end of its existence.  She ultimately gives up on a future with the Tiger, sensing that he would never admit to needing help.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #58</ref>

===Other adventures===
After the Suicide Squad's heyday, Mari continus to do undercover work. She is drafted for at least one mission for [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] (the Squad's brother organization).<ref>''Hawk and Dove'' vol. 4 #2-5</ref>  At some point, she signs on to work with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle's]]  [[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]].  She goes undercover to investigate a strange "superhero" cult, where the leader was using mind control and winds up brainwashed by him herself.  [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|The Huntress]] tries to help her and is nearly killed.  Vixen regains her senses by channeling the stubbornness of a mule to hold back the mind control of the cult leader.  She and Huntress then rescue the other brainwashed heroes.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #69-72</ref>

Vixen may still have trouble controlling her animal side while using the totem, as witnessed when she worked alongside the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] to stop [[Gorilla Grodd]].<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2 #44-46</ref> She also serves on one mission with the [[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]<ref>''Justice League Task Force'' #7-8</ref>,  came to [[Wonder Woman]]'s aid during a battle with [[Circe (comics)|Circe]]<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2  #174-175</ref>, and helps her former JLA comrades protect [[Lex Luthor]] (''JLA/JSA: Virtue & Vice'').  She then joins the loose-knit [[Ultramarine Corps]]<ref>''JLA'' #26</ref>. While part of the Corps, Mari is brainwashed by [[Gorilla Grodd]] who sends her and other heroes to battle the JLA. Ultimately, Vixen and the others are freed. The main Corps members move on to another universe.<ref>''JLA: Classified'' #1-3</ref>  Through all of these adventures she manages to remain active in the fashion industry.

===Infinite Crisis===
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
After the murder of [[Sue Dibny]] in the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, Vixen rejoins her Justice League colleagues.  She is present when the original [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] dies during a battle with the [[Shadow Thief]].  Vixen adopts a new uniform in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, similar to the one worn by her television counterpart on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
Vixen is tricked into battle in [[Hub City (comics)|Hub City]] by a currently intelligent [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] (whose rebirth came with increased intelligence).  The totem is essential to Grundy's plans: he intends to use it as a catalyst to merge his perpetually reincarnating soul with the shell of the [[Amazo]] [[android]], and thus gain further power.  Grundy uses the totem to increase the metahuman mimicking abilities of Amazo.  Without her totem, Vixen finds that her innate connection to the "Red", the 'essence' of animal life', is falling apart.  She manages to 'lock onto' the totem, but her mind becomes lost in a flock of migrating birds.  After mimicking the abilities of a young boy, Vixen manages to regain her mind and quickly flies to New York to retrieve her totem.  Vixen literally drops into the JLA battle against Amazo.  After the villains are subdued, Vixen becomes a charter member of the newly revamped ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]''.

===Justice League of America===
Vixen's main story arc in the early issues of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) center around a change in her powers, which means she is no longer drawing on animal characteristics, but rather the powers of those around her, matching their skill levels and, she suspects, draining powers from the owner him/herself.  [[Superman]] is first to catch on to this and she subsequently reveals it to [[Red Arrow]].

In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #22, she seeks out her former [[Suicide Squad]] teammate [[Bronze Tiger]] to discuss her situation, and subsequently admits everything to the League.  Chairperson [[Black Canary]] instructs her to hand in her credentials and removes her from the team, but then discusses with Mari the possibility of seeking [[Zatanna]]'s assistance in fixing the properties of the totem.

When Zatanna attempts to find the source of the problem, she sees a mystic image of Vixen and Animal Man as puppets.  When she tries to break the spell, she is repelled by an unknown force.  When Vixen attempts to defeat the newly-restored Amazo by absorbing all his stolen powers, she becomes mysteriously weak.  She falls unconscious, with Amazo bearing down on her.

When Zatanna and [[Red Tornado (comics)|Red Tornado]] finally resolve the crisis, Vixen goes to seek [[Animal Man]], since he's been affected by similar power fluctuations, and left unable to tap into the powers of Earth-borne animals.  There, they're both sucked into the Tantu Totem, where, like in Zatanna's vision, they're entrapted into [[Anansi]]'s net.  Anansi, the Trickster God of African [[folklore]], reveals his powers, possibly related to the former [[hypertime]], and how being the ''king of the stories'', he changed Buddy and Mari's personal histories and sources of powers to test them.

In an attempt to keep them contained, Anansi restores them their connection to the ''Red'', but alters the personal histories of the Leaguers, to prevent them from ever founding the JLA.  Vixen however escapes, and seeks the ''new'' Leaguers to fight Anansi at their side.  Although she succeeds in gathering allies, they are still no match for Anansi's power.  Vixen holds a gun to her totem, knowing that if it is destroyed, they will all be destroyed, and forces Anansi to return things to normal.  Anansi then reveals to Mari that the whole thing was actually a test.  He explains that reality had been changed on a fundamental level, and he needed someone to act as his agent against an individual who could take advantage of the situation.  He restores Mari's powers, returns her and the JLA home, and says that he will one day call upon her.

===Return of the Lion===
''Return of the Lion'' will reveal what really happened to her parents and the truth about who really killed them.

==Powers and abilities==
Vixen possesses the innate ability to make direct contact with the Earth's [[Morphogenetic field]], which is sometimes known as the Red.  This contact with the Red allows Vixen to [[List of comic book superpowers#animal mimicry|mimic the abilities]] of nearby animals, by simply focusing on a specific animal's abilities and then drawing it directly from the field.  Her natural range for mimicking these abilities is about 150 feet. Vixen wears a mystic artifact called the Tantu Totem, a fox-head shaped talisman given to her ancestors by the African trickster god [[Anansi]].  It was previously thought that the totem was the source of her powers but according to ''Justice League of America'' #5; it merely prevents her natural link to the Morphogenetic field from overwhelming her mind.  It is assumed that the totem also increases her range for mimicking the abilities of animals, as she has been known to mimic the abilities of animals on the other side of the world. She has also demonstrated the ability to hold onto the Morphogenetic traits of all the animals in a forest.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #24</ref> Currently, she seems to have to call out the name of the animal she wishes to draw power from in order to use that power (such as saying "cat" before she could use the agility of a cat).

So far, Vixen has used the following skills: the telepathic and physical abilities of [[Gorilla Grodd]],<ref>''Flash'' #46</ref> the flight of a [[hawk]], the swimming ability of a [[dolphin]], the speed of a [[cheetah]], the [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] of a bat, the [[List of comic book superpowers#wallcrawling|wallcrawling]] of a [[spider]], the jumps of a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], the constriction of an [[anaconda]], the strength of a [[Elephant|bull elephant]], the senses of a [[Gray Wolf|wolf]], the agility of a [[Spider monkey|monkey]], the debilitating shock of an [[electric eel]], the regenerative abilities of [[earthworm]]s,<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #71</ref>, and the ability to spit venom like a [[spitting cobra]].  She has even been shown to be able to channel the powers of extinct animals, such as the [[saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed tiger]] and the [[Triceratops]], and domesticated animals like the [[Doberman Pinscher]].

Vixen's claws are particularly sharp and tough, enabling her to rend through a variety of substances, such as fabric, wood, even soft metals and cinder block with ease.  Her claws are magically enhanced and have drawn blood from individuals who are considered highly durable like [[Geo-Force]] and Pre-Crisis [[Superman]].<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #73</ref><ref name="Action Comics #521"/>

Occasionally, she has been known to physically transform into animals&mdash;for example, she has [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a [[Gray Wolf|wolf]], a [[Great Horned Owl|great horned owl]], and a [[cougar]].<ref>''Hawk and Dove'' #4-5</ref>  Vixen can also assume a hybrid form, in which she maintains a humanoid form but with certain animal adaptation, like when she took on the gills, fins, and lack of eyes of a blind cavefish in ''JSA Classified'' and later shapeshifted into a humanoid wolf (retaining the cavefish's blindness). The totem also allows her to heal bruises and wounds within seconds by simply touching it.<ref>''Animal Man'' #12</ref>
 
It is unknown what would happen if Vixen tried to use her magical abilities on an alien animal, or if she would gain access to the morphogenetic field of another planet.

While the full extent of Vixen's control over the morphogenetic field is unknown, she has on occasions drawn pure energy from it and displayed this energy as a force field and energy claws.<ref>''Animal Man'' #44</ref>  While in cooperation with [[Animal Man]] and the woman known as "Tristess", she helped to create an entire universe.<ref>''Animal Man'' #48-50</ref>

One apparent drawback of Vixen's powers is that she is not always able to control the inputs from the morphogenetic field.  Sometimes, she has absorbed unwanted animal behavior, such as instinctive rage.  The longer she stays in contact with the morphogenetic field, the less human and more animal she seems to become.<ref>''Flash'' #45</ref>

After being forced to tap into the human template as a matter to purge herself from pure animalistic sensations, Vixen is briefly left by the God Anansi with a crippled connection with the morphogenetic field, unable to reach any animal except the ''human animal''. In this state she shows the ability to mimic [[metahuman]] powers, such as [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]'s speed, [[Geo-Force]]'s earth-based powers, [[Black Lightning]]'s elemental control, as well as the [[Kryptonian]] [[powers and abilities of Superman|superpowers]] of [[Superman]], an extraterrestrial.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' #11</ref>  Her abilities are not only limited to that of metahumans, as she was able to duplicate [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]]'s archery skills and even [[Green Lantern]]'s ring in a recent issue of ''Justice League of America'', suggesting that she has gained powers similar to that of [[Amazo]].

It is revealed that this is actually trickery on the part of Anansi.  Upon confronting him within the Tantu Totem, Vixen learns the truth about her powers:  For unknown reasons, Anansi has made the Tantu Totem his current home.  Vixen's family are custodians and guardians of the totem, which they have passed down through the generations.  The totem's guardian, in return, is given powers by Anansi.  While Mari doesn't need to be wearing the totem to have use her powers, she is expected to keep it safe for Anansi.
Anansi restores Vixen's original animal powers, then, after testing her abilities as a hero, he states that she is his "champion".  <ref>''Justice League of America'' #25-26</ref> 

===Justice League Unlimited===
Vixen has made numerous appearances on [[Cartoon Network (US)|Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series.  Voiced by [[Gina Torres]], Vixen first appeared on the episode "Wake the Dead."  Her first scene was on the catwalk and she was later revealed to be [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern's]] girlfriend, to the jealousy of his former lover [[Hawkgirl#Justice League|Shayera Hol]], who still harbored strong and perhaps requited feelings for him.

Though not a regular on the show, Vixen was later featured in "Hunter's Moon," where she, along with [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]], came to terms with Shayera Hol's actions in the [[Thanagar]]ian invasion of [[Earth]].  They even established a friendship of sorts.  In another episode, she and Shayera are teamed up with [[Black Canary]] and [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] in a forced (and unsuccessful) battle against the powerhouse Wonder Woman.  As the series ended, John Stewart and Vixen were a couple, though the durability of their relationship is called into question by the creators' post-show comments and the existence of a future son, [[Warhawk (Batman Beyond)|Warhawk]] between Shayera Hol and John Stewart.

On ''Justice League Unlimited'', Vixen is apparently unable to fly, but can adjust her mass to that of larger animals (like an elephant), and land on an opponent with the weight of several tons, while retaining her normal shape.

===''DC Universe Online''===
Vixen is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
