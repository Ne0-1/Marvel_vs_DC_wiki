'''Vixen''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. She was nearly the first female [[African-American]] DC superhero to star in her own series, but the first issue of her series was cancelled in the [[DC Implosion]] in 1978, never to be released. (It was subsequently printed in ''[[Cancelled Comics Cavalcade]]''.) Her first appearance distributed to the public was in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #521 (1981). 

==History== 
In ancient [[Africa]], there was a legend that the warrior Tantu asked [[Anansi]] the Spider to create a totem that would give the wearer all of the powers of the animal kingdom, if they would use the power to protect the innocent. As shown in the pages of [[Animal Man]], it is possible that the "Anansi" who Tantu met, may have been a member of the alien race who gave Buddy Baker the ability to tap the [[Morphogenetic field]]. According to the Animal Man series Mari's Tantu totem may tap into that same field. Tantu used the totem to become Africa's first legendary hero. The totem was later passed down to Tantu's descendants until it reached the McCabes.

==Fictional character biography==
Growing up in a small African village, '''Mari Jiwe McCabe''' heard the legend of the "Tantu Totem" from her parents. She was the daughter of Reverend Richard Jiwe, the village priest, who was her sole caretaker, as poachers killed her mother years ago. Reverend Jiwe himself was killed by his half-brother (Mari's uncle) General Maksai. Makasai wanted the Tantu Totem, which had been in Reverend Jiwe's possession.

Orphaned, Mari fled to America. She set up an identity for herself as Mari McCabe and used her beauty to become a well-known fashion model in [[New York City]]. She used her newfound wealth to travel the world. On a trip back to Africa, she came across her uncle, and stole back the Tantu Totem, using its power to become the '''Vixen'''.

She was a member of the [[Justice League]] during the [[Justice League Detroit]] era (along with other Birds of Prey agent [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]]). She has had memberships with [[Suicide Squad]], [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]], and [[Ultramarine Corps]]. While a member of the Suicide Squad she fell in love with and had a failed relationship with the [[Bronze Tiger]]. She also led a team of heroines against [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] and her army of super-villainesses during one of Circe's battles against [[Wonder Woman]]. In ''JLA/JSA: Vice and Virtue'', she was seen as a bodyguard protecting President [[Lex Luthor]] from an attack by Doctor Bedlam.

Vixen was contacted by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to join her [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] and went undercover investigate a strange "superhero" cult, where the leader was able to mind-control her. [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] tried to help her and was nearly killed by Vixen, but Vixen regained her senses and used the stubbornness of a mule to hold back the mind-control of the cult leader. She and Huntress rescued the other brainwashed heroes.

===Identity Crisis===

During the ''Identity Crisis'' mini-series she was at the side of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] while battling the [[Shadow-Thief]], and Firestorm was impaled by the [[Shining Knight]]'s sword, which the Shadow Thief had stolen.  The magical sword ruptured the nuclear man's containment field, resulting in Firestorm's body exploding. For killing Firestorm, the Shadow Thief was prosecuted by [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] (a.k.a. [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter IX]]), and Vixen testified during the trial.

===One Year Later===
{{see also|One Year Later}}
At the end of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, as a prelude to the ''One Year Later'' event, Vixen wears a costume similar to the one worn by her television counterpart on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]].''

Vixen is featured in the first issue of the re-launched ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]].''

==Powers and abilities==
*According to Justice League of America #5 February 2007, the Tantu Totem is not the source of her powers, it merely prevents her link to the [[Morphogenetic field]] from overwhelming her mind. 
*Vixen wears a mystic artifact object called the '''Tantu Totem''', a fox-head shaped talisman given to her ancestors by the African trickster god [[Anansi]]. Vixen can make direct contact with Earth's Morphogenetic field, sometimes known as the ''Red''.(Recent issues of the Justice League of America, show that Vixen can mimic the abilities of animals without the totem but she seems to have problems controlling the imput.)  This allows her to mimic the abilities of any animal she can think of, by simply focusing on a specific animals abilities and then drawing it directly from the field. She has demonstrated the ability to hold onto the Morphogenetic traits of an entire forest of animals.<ref>See JLA Classified #24</ref>
*So far Vixen has been able to use: the telepathic and physical abilities of [[Gorilla Grodd]],<ref>See Flash #46</ref> the flight of a [[hawk]], the swimming ability of a [[dolphin]], the speed of an [[cheetah]], the wall-crawling of a [[spider]], the jumps of a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], the constriction of an [[anaconda]], the strength of a [[Elephant|bull elephant]], the senses of a [[Gray Wolf|wolf]], the agility of a [[Spider monkey|monkey]], the debilitating shock of an [[electric eel]], the regenerative abilities of [[earthworm]]s<ref>Birds of Prey #71</ref>, and the ability to spit venom like a [[spitting cobra]]. 
*Vixen's claws are particularly sharp and tough, enabling her to rend through a variety of substances, such as fabric, wood, even soft metals and cinder block with ease. Her claws are magically enhanced and have drawn blood from individuals who are considered highly durable like Geo-Force and Pre-Crisis Superman.<ref>See Birds of Prey #73 and Action Comic #521</ref>
*Occasionally, she has been known to physically transform into animals - for example, she has [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a [[Gray Wolf|wolf]], a [[Great Horned Owl|great horned owl]], and a [[Puma|cougar]]. The totem even allows her to heal bruises and wounds within seconds by simply touching it.<ref>See Hawk and Dove #4-5, and Animal Man #12</ref>
*It is unknown what would happen if Vixen tried to use her magical abilities on an alien animal, or if she would gain access to the Morphogenetic field of another planet. 
*While the full extent of Vixenâ€™s control over the Morphogenetic field is unknown, she has on occasions drawn pure energy from it and displayed this energy as a force field and energy claws. <ref>See Animal Man #44</ref> While in cooperation with [[Animal Man]] and the woman known as '''Tristess''', she helped to create an entire universe.<ref>See Animal Man #48-50</ref>
*One apparent drawback of Vixen's powers is that she is not always able to control the inputs from the Morphogenetic field. Sometimes, she has absorbed unwanted animal behavior, such as instinctive rage. Meaning the longer she stays in contact with the Morphogenetic field, the less human and more animal she seems to become.<ref>See Flash #45</ref>

==Trivia==
*In the unpublished ''Vixen'' #1 (which was printed in Cancelled Comics Calvacade), she was referred to as '''Marilyn Macabe'''.

==Other media==
===Justice League Unlimited===
[[Image:Vixen JLU.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Vixen in ''Justice League Unlimited'']]
*Vixen has made numerous appearances on [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series. Voiced by [[Gina Torres]], Vixen first appeared on the episode "Wake the Dead". Her first scene was on the catwalk and she was later revealed to be [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern's]] girlfriend, to the jealousy of his former lover [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Shayera Hol]], who still harboured strong and perhaps requited feelings for him.
*Though not a regular on the show, Vixen was later featured in "Hunter's Moon", where she, along with [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]], came to terms with Shayera Hol's actions in the [[Thanagar]]ian invasion of [[Earth]]. In another episode, she and Shayera are teamed up with Black Canary and Huntress in a forced (and unsuccessful) battle royale against the powerhouse Wonder Woman.  As the series ended, John Stewart and Vixen were a couple, though the durability of their relationship is called into question by the creators' post-show comments and the existence of a [[Warhawk (Batman Beyond)|canon son]] between Shayera Hol and John Stewart.
*On ''Justice League Unlimited'', Vixen is apparently unable to shapeshift or fly, but can adjust her mass to that of larger animals (like an elephant), and land on an opponent with the weight of several tons, while retaining her normal shape.
