'''Superwoman''' is the name given to several [[fictional character]]s published over the years by ''[[DC Comics]]'', most of them being, like the popular [[Supergirl]], a woman with powers similar to those of DC's highly popular [[Superman]]. The name "Superwoman" was originally copyrighted by ''[[Detective Comics]]''<ref>January 1942</ref> in an effort to prevent competitors from using it. As was the practice, an [[ashcan copy]] was created with the title of ''Superwoman''. The cover was a reproduction of ''More Fun Comics''<ref>Issue #73</ref> with the interior content reprinting of the third issue.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11992 ''Action Comics'' #3 —]</ref> The first true appearance of Superwoman, which is usually thought to have been one of many trial runs for the future introduction of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]] as Supergirl years later, was printed in ''[[Action Comics]]''.<ref name="May '43">Issue #60 — May 1943</ref>

==Versions==
===Lois Lane===
{{Main|Lois Lane }}
[[File:SuperwomanLoisLane.PNG|thumb|200px|left|[[Lois Lane]]'s first appearance as Superwoman. Art by John Sikela.]]

The first appearance of the name "Superwoman" in a DC comic was a story in ''[[Action Comics]]''<ref name="May '43" /> where [[Lois Lane]] dreams that she has gained superpowers from a [[blood transfusion]] from Superman and launches a career as Superwoman.

The theme would be revisited in a 1947 ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]''<ref>Issue #45, in a story titled "Lois Lane, Superwoman!" — (March–April 1947)</ref> comic in which a pair of fraudulent magicians cast a "spell" on Lane, making her believe she has superpowers. Superman is forced to play along with the ruse for a time, using super-speed to invisibly intervene in Lane's adventures, supporting the illusion. She briefly sports a costume modeled on Superman's before the spell is "broken". A story from ''Action Comics'' has Lois actually gaining superpowers thanks to one of [[Lex Luthor]]'s inventions, and launches a short-lived career as "Superwoman."<ref name>Issue #156 — released May 1951</ref>

Later stories would sporadically feature tales in which Lois gained superpowers and functioned as a "Superwoman" of sorts, but all of these were, like the 1951 tale above, only temporary, with the powers wearing off by the end of the story. A typical example of this is "The Turnabout Powers" from ''[[Superman Family]]'',<ref>Issue #207 (May–June 1981)</ref> where the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] Lois Lane gained powers from her husband (the [[Kal-L|Earth-Two Superman]]) through the unexpected effect of an exotic extraterrestrial plant Superman had brought into their home. The plant's death reversed the effect. Another example would be in the ''[[World's Finest Comics|Batman/Superman: World's Finest]]'' mini-series where [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] briefly transformed Lois into a "Superwoman" with costume and powers.

At the end of ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' #2,<ref>Issue #2</ref> Lois Lane is presented with a formula called "Exo-Genes" created by Superman that allows her to have his powers for 24 hours, and she became Superwoman. During her adventures with her new [[Kryptonian]] powers,<ref>''All-Star Superman'' #3</ref> she was wooed by two superhumans named "[[Samson]]" and "[[Atlas (Mythology)|Atlas]]", and was captured by a time-Ultrasphinx. Her powers faded away at the end of the day. Notably, her costume seemed to be exactly the same as that of the Anti-Matter Universe's Superwoman (see below), but in Superman's colors. Both outfits were designed by [[Frank Quitely]].

===Luma Lynai===
{{Main|Luma Lynai}}
A woman from the distant planet of Staryl, Luma Lynai wins the heart of Superman. Just as Superman derives his powers from a yellow sun, Lumisa derived her gifts of [[Superhuman strength|super-strength]] and [[flight]] from an orange sun. Their romance doesn't last, as Luma becomes deathly ill under the rays of a yellow sun, and Superman can't leave Earth undefended. She physically resembles an adult [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], with a similar costume, except instead of being blue-and-red with a pentagonal S shield, Luma's costume is white-and-green with a circular S emblem.

===Crime Syndicate of America===
{{See also|Alternative versions of Wonder Woman|}}

====Earth-Three====
In 1964, an evil counterpart of [[Wonder Woman]] from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] named "Superwoman" was introduced. This Superwoman was a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], a villainous counterpart of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] from the parallel world of "[[Earth-Three]]" (vs. the Justice League's world of "Earth-One"). Superwoman, like Wonder Woman, was an [[Amazons|Amazon]], and possessed similar powers of super-strength and flight. Unlike most/all other versions, her [[magic lasso]] could change shape into any form she desired, including a giant winged serpent. The Crime Syndicate first came to Earth-One when they felt they were becoming too soft as they were receiving no real challenge to their powers and Ultraman discovered Earth-One after gaining the power to gaze between worlds after exposure to a hunk of Kryptonite. Wonder Woman defeated Superwoman on Earth-1, Black Canary defeated her on Earth-2 and tied her up in her lasso, but like the other JSA members was transported to Earth-3 when she says she won due to a vibratory force Power Ring had placed in their bodies, and in the showdown on Earth-2 Superwoman was defeated again by Wonder Woman making her grasp both lassos, meaning she couldn't control them and was knocked out by her foe. The Crime Syndicate were defeated and imprisoned between Earth-One and Two by Green Lantern in a green bubble.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} Later the Crime Syndicate were freed by the [[time travel]]ling villain [[Per Degaton]] after he was caught up in a time-storm, discovered their bubble, and freed them. They tried to get him, but he revealed he had made sure he and his Time Machine would vibrate at a different speed to them, meaning they couldn't touch him. They helped him change history and conquer Earth-2 by stealing [[nuclear missiles]] from the [[Cuban Missile crisis]] of [[Earth-Prime]], and when the Syndicate betray him they are sent to 1982 of Earth-1, as he had made sure this would happen when they touched him. They materialised on the JLA's satellite headquarters, and defeated the heroes. The JSA were imprisoned in their prison, but the combined powers of [[Starman (Ted Knight)|Starman]] and [[Doctor Fate]] got them out. They helped him again when the [[Justice League|JLA]] tried to restore history, though were planning to betray him. When Degaton was defeated this timeline was erased and the Syndicate was re-imprisoned.

The Pre-''Crisis'' version of Superwoman was killed, along with the rest of the CSA, when they were trying to save Earth-Three from being destroyed by the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s antimatter wave.<ref>''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #1</ref>

====Antimatter Earth====
[[File:SuperwomanEarth2.png|200px|The Antimatter Superwoman. Art by [[Frank Quitely]].|thumb]]
In Post-''Crisis'' continuity, as established in the 1998 [[graphic novel]] ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]], Superwoman (and the rest of the Crime Syndicate) comes from a parallel world similar to Earth, but located in an [[antimatter]] universe (also home to the planet [[Qward]]).<ref name="dc-crim">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Crime Syndicate | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 89  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Superwoman continues to make occasional appearances as a member of the Crime Syndicate, most recently appearing in storylines in the ''Justice League'' and ''Superman'' comics. Unlike her pre-''Crisis'' counterpart, her magic lasso doesn't change shape, but releases the inhibitions of anyone tied with it (just as Wonder Woman's compels victims to tell the truth). She also possesses [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction|heat vision]], as [[Superman]] and Ultraman do.

Taking the alias Lois Lane, Superwoman is an [[Amazons|Amazon]] by birth, and has risen through the ranks to become the chief editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' in what she calls "Patriarch's World". This disguise resembles Wonder Woman's secret identity of Diana Prince. At the Planet, Superwoman is shown to upset her colleagues; the antimatter-[[Cat Grant]] refers to Superwoman as "Queen Bitch",<ref>"[[JLA: Earth 2]]"</ref> and negatively alludes to her "friendship" with the antimatter [[Jimmy Olsen]]. In her later appearances, it is stated that prior to taking on Lois Lane identity, Superwoman was born on Damnation Island, presumably the Antimatter counterpart to [[Themyscira]] (or "Paradise Island"). It is mentioned that she had killed off all of her fellow Amazons, and upon meeting [[Donna Troy]], she becomes ecstatic over the prospect of being able to kill another one of her kind for the first time in years.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #50</ref>

Jimmy Olsen is the only [[civilian]] who knows of Superwoman's secret identity. A compliant sexual deviant, he does what she tells him in exchange for the favour of watching when she changes her outfit and receiving pieces of it for his "disguise kit". He is so besotted that he ignores her gibes and insults, even when she tauntingly refers to him as, "[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen|Superwoman's Snitch, Jimmy Olsen]]," and prints it in the Planet.

Also in the ''Earth 2'' story, her lover [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] hates Superwoman's frigidity towards him. Meanwhile, she is carrying on a torrid affair with [[Owlman (DC Comics)|Owlman]], and they sneak trysts whenever they feel Ultraman is not watching. However, from his floating fortress (the antimatter counterpart to the [[Fortress of Solitude]]), Ultraman doesn't hesitate to fire warning bursts of heat vision towards them whenever he catches them together.<ref name="dc-crim"/>

====Earth-3====
In ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' Week 52, a recreation of [[Earth-Three#New Multiverse|Earth-3]] was shown as a part of the new Multiverse. In the depiction were characters that are altered versions of the original [[Justice Society of America]], including Wonder Woman. The character is not identified in ''52'',<ref>
{{Cite comic | title=[[52 (comic book)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=11 | panel=3-4 }}</ref> but later in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', which identifies her as Superwoman of the Crime Society of America, on an alternative world which is a reversed version of Earth-2. Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Grant Morrison also suggests that the Earth-3 and Antimatter Superwomen both exist post-''52''.

Like the antimatter iteration of the character, she is indeed both a Lois Lane and Wonder Woman counterpart, despite possessing [[Kryptonian]] abilities such as heat vision. In ''Countdown'', she is recruited into the [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch's]] army but has her eyes gouged out by Red Robin ([[Jason Todd]]) of New Earth, who may or may not have been carrying [[Kryptonite]].

===Mxyzptlk's Superwoman===
[[File:SuperwomanSB.jpg|200px|left|The Superwoman (along with Batwoman and Superlad) from ''Superman/Batman'' #24.|thumb]]
In ''Superman'' #349 ("The Turnabout Trap!"),<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', volume 1, #349 (in a story entitled "The Turnabout Trap!")</ref> Superman returns from an interstellar mission to find that everyone on Earth is of opposite sex. Among them are Penny White (a female [[Perry White]]), Jenny Olsen (a female [[Jimmy Olsen]]), Louis Lane (a male Lois Lane), [[Batwoman]] (a female [[Batman]], rather than the actual character), Wonder Warrior (a male [[Wonder Woman]]. DC comics could not use the name [[Wonder Man]] at the time because Marvel Comics holds the trademark and copyright. A later character did use the name Wonder Man however— see below.), Black Condor (a male [[Black Canary]]), Superlad (a male [[Supergirl]]), and Superwoman (his female counterpart) herself. Believing he crossed into a parallel universe, Superman flies back to space to find a dimensional portal, but is blocked by an invisible barrier. He notices the parallelism fails when he sees Superwoman and Clara Kent (Superwoman's presumed secret identity) are two separate people. 

When he confronts Superwoman he discovers that he is regarded as a super-villain in this gender-reversed world, which leads to a battle with Superwoman, Superboy (a male Supergirl), and Wonder Warrior. They manage to trap Superman with Wonder Warrior on guard, but he manages to escape and takes Wonder Warrior's magic lasso with him. Superman figures out that his foe [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]] is behind this gender-reversed world. This was partly due to the discrepancy of Clara Kent and Superwoman being different people. However, Mxyzptlk's biggest mistake was being too vain to give himself a reverse-gender counterpart in Superwoman's rogues gallery in [[The Daily Planet]] morgue; all of Superwoman's foes were reverse-gender counterparts to Superman's foes (Leslie Luthor ([[Lex Luthor]]), Bizaress ([[Bizarro]]) and the Toywoman ([[Toyman]])) - except for Mxyzptlk. Superman discovers as well that he was never in a parallel universe, but rather on Earth, which Mxyzptlk had altered with his magic. After using Wonder Warrior's magic lasso to make Mxyzptlk say his name backwards and thus returning to his native dimension, the effects of Mxyzptlk's magic (including the existence of Superwoman) vanish, returning the Earth to normal. Upon his return to his Clark Kent identity he is startled to discover there is still a Louis Lane, but he turns out to be Lois Lane's cousin.

===Laurel Kent===
A new Superwoman named "Laurel", apparently a female version of Superman from a parallel Earth (now identified as Earth-11), appeared for the first time in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'',<ref>Issue #23 — released November 2005</ref> and was featured an issue later.<ref>Issue #24</ref> In Earth 11's alternate universe, much like in the one featured in "The Turnabout Trap!", reversed-gender characters exist relative to those resident on New Earth: there is a Batwoman (female Batman), Superlad (male Supergirl), and a female [[Darkseid]] known as the "Dark Queen".  (It is notable that in pre-Crisis continuity, "Laurel Kent" was the name of a 30th century descendant of Superman who occasionally appeared in stories featuring the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], and was replaced in continuity by [[Laurel Gand]].)

In December 2007, Superwoman and Batwoman were featured in ''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman'' #1. It features Earth-11 as part of the new DC Multiverse and presents a male version of Wonder Woman called [[Wonder Man (DC Comics)#Dane of Elysium|Wonder Man]], who originates from a society of male Amazons. It also depicts that world's version of ''[[Amazons Attack!]]''

===Kristin Wells===
{{Main|Kristin Wells}}
[[File:DC Comics Presents Annual 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Superwoman (Kristin Wells). Art by [[Gil Kane]], 1983.]]
Another version of Superwoman, this one a heroic character, came about in the form of Kristin Wells, who was created by Superman comic writer [[Elliot S! Maggin]]. Wells first appeared in Maggin's Superman novel ''[[Miracle Monday]]'', but he later introduced her in the pages of [[DC Comics Presents]] as Superwoman. The character Wells is a 29th-century descendant of [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Wells [[time travel]]s to the 20th century, where the technology she had brought from the future gives her super powers. It is this iteration of the character which appears briefly in [[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]

===Dana Dearden===
[[File:SuperwomanDD.jpg|200px|right|The Dana Dearden Superwoman.|thumb]]
Obsessed Superman fan Dana Dearden dated [[Jimmy Olsen]] to get close to Superman, and when that didn't work she stole mystic artifacts which granted her the strength of [[Hercules]], the speed (and flight) of [[Hermes]], the thunderbolts of [[Zeus]], and the sight of [[Heimdall]]. Dana donned a green-and-purple uniform,<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #538 — September 1996</ref> with "Superwoman" written down the leggings, and called herself Superwoman, and tried to get Superman to fall in love with her. He rejected her advances, and Jimmy called her '''Obsession'''. She vanished attempting to help Superman rescue people from a burning ship. When Superman was split into his Red and Blue energy forms,<ref>''Superman: The Man of Tomorrow'', Issue #10</ref> Superwoman returned hoping that one of the Supermen would return her feelings, but [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] intervened, and used her [[telepathy]] to convince Superwoman that she would destroy Superman with her love. The telepathic illusion wore off<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #574 — released January 2000</ref> and she would try to win Superman over again, this time in a red-and blue costume very similar to his, and claimed to be his wife in response to a recent photograph of Superman wearing a wedding ring. During a subsequent attack of humans using the DMN drug- which turned the users into violent demons until the 'high' was over-, Superman convinced her to help him stop the DMN users, arguing that, if she truly loved him, she would help him do his duty rather than attack him for potentially picking someone else over her. She died trying to protect him from one of the DMN users when it almost struck him in the back while he was distracted, since she knew he was vulnerable to magic.

===Lucy Lane===
[[File:Superwoman.png|200px|left|New Krypton Superwoman.|thumb]]
{{Main|Lucy Lane}}
[[Lucy Lane]] first appeared as Superwoman in ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #35 (January 2009), her costume a nod to that of the Bronze Age Superwoman [[Kristin Wells]] and containing a containment field that simulated Kryptonian powers. However, Lucy's identity was not revealed until near the story arc's end. During her tenure as Superwoman, she was blackmailed by her father, General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], into performing acts of villainy such as killing [[Agent Liberty]], who had been spying on General Lane and Lex Luthor.<ref>''Action Comics'' #873</ref>  (This resulted in her being the focus of the ''Supergirl'' [[Faces of Evil]] issue.)  She later attacked Reactron, which tipped off readers that Superwoman was not Kryptonian (in that that villain's Gold Kryptonite power source had no effect on her<ref>''Supergirl'' #38</ref>). Supergirl unmasks Superwoman,<ref>''Supergirl'' #40</ref> and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit, causing Lucy's body to contort and explode.<ref>''Supergirl'' #41</ref> In the Supergirl annual Lucy is brought back to life by the suit as it steals the life of another person. The suit is then revealed to be a magical creation of Mirabai of the Forlorn, ally of Sam Lane, who mystically infused in it the genetic abilities of several alien races of Kryptonian might: when Supergirl ruptured it, the backlash permanently altered Lucy Lane into being a composite alien being of human appearance herself, with inherent Kryptonian abilities.<ref>Supergirl (Vol. 5)#50(February 2010)</ref> This Superwoman was last seen as a prisoner after Sam Lane's machinations during the [[War of the Supermen]] storyline came to an end, though it was hinted she would escape at some point in the future. However the launch of the [[New 52]] has ended that storyline, and there is no indication of anyone in the new 52 line who has claimed the identity as of December 2012.

==Other uses==
Various comic stories, pre- and post-Crisis, have offered glimpses of possible futures assuming that one of the various incarnations of Supergirl would eventually change her codename to Superwoman upon reaching what she considered adulthood. One example is a 1980 issue of ''[[Superman Family]]'',<ref>#200 — released April 1980</ref> in which all the stories are set in the then- near future 1999 or 2000 (the timeframe is cited only as "the turn of the century") with the characters aged appropriately, including an older Linda Danvers (Kara Zor-El) who divides her time between her career as Superwoman and serving as governor of [[Florida]].  

Alternatively, some stories assume one of [[Superman Dynasty|Superman's female descendants]] would assume the name "Superwoman", like his daughter Kara and great-granddaughter Lara from the [[Elseworlds]] series, ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]''.

==In other media==
*An [[Pornographic film|adult film]] version of Superman was produced called ''Superwoman'' (1979). Directed by Joe Sherman, written by John Finegold, and starring [[Desireé Cousteau]] as the main character Superwoman/Linda Kent, a court action by Warner Bros. prompted the name of the film to be changed to Ms. Magnificent and most of the references to Superman removed or altered (such as Superman's iconic S-shield).
*A version of Superwoman appeared on ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' in the season three episode, "Ultra Woman."<ref>November 12, 1995 (Episode 7)</ref> Clark lost his powers when a red [[kryptonite]] laser beam hit him and transferred his powers to Lois. Both of them were unaware of the transfer, until Lois pulled down an iron gate with her bare hands.  Martha Kent made her a costume and Clark introduces her to Metropolis as Ultrawoman.
*[[Gina Torres]] played the Crime Syndicate version of Superwoman in ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]''. According to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], rather than being the counterpart of Wonder Woman, this version of Superwoman is an analogue of [[Mary Marvel]].<ref>http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showthread.php?p=10558994#post10558994</ref>  However, Superwoman and Wonder Woman still became rivals and the Amazon Princess easily bested her in combat during the final battle. Unlike in the comic books, Superwoman has a relationship with [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]], even collaborates with him of his plot to destroy the multiverse. However, she also develops a crush toward [[Batman]], who rejects her advances. There is no mention of her being with [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] and she is presumably not with him. She is described as having psychotic tendencies. Superwoman is arrested after the Justice League and the [[United States Marine Corps]] defeated her and the rest of the Syndicate.
*The Lois Lane Superwoman is featured in the ''[[All-Star Superman (film)|All-Star Superman]]'' movie.
