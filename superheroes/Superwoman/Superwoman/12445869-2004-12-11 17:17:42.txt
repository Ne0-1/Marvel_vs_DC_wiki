There have been several fictional characters that have been called Superwoman. One is an evil version of [[Wonder Woman]] who is a part of the [[Crime Syndicate of Amerika]]. [[Lois Lane]], in some stories, was also temporarily turned into a female [[Superman]]. It was also assumed that [[Supergirl]] would one day change her name to Superwoman.

This article is about the character of Kristin Wells, created by writer [[Elliot S! Maggin]], who first appeared in his Superman novel [[Miracle Monday]], but he later introduced her in the pages of [[DC Comics]] as Superwoman. 

Kristin is a descendant of [[Jimmy Olsen]] who lived in the 29th century (like him, Kristin is a freckled redhead.) She was a journalism student whose graduation thesis was the successful investigation of the origins of the holiday known as Miracle Monday, using a form of [[time travel]] technology that had just began to be used by the public in her era. She then became a teacher, but became interested in finding out the identity of Superwoman, the last superhero from the 20th century whose identity was never found out. She managed to convince the authorities of her time to send her again to the present, at the moment when Superwoman was supposed to debut, helping Superman fight a villain called King Kosmos. Kristin soon deduced that SHE was supposed to become Superwoman, and, using some of the technology she had brought from the future, and that (conveniently enough) allowed her to pretend to have super powers, she disguised herself and helped Superman defeat Kosmos. She revealed the truth to Superman, then returned to the future to make it public. She realized she would have to periodically return to the present to ensure that all the historical events Superwoman was part of were fulfilled.

However, during one of those trips, a malfunction of the time travel process -which was still imperfect- left Kristin trapped in the past, suffering [[amnesia]]. This caused her boyfriend to lead a movement against time travel that eventually got it banned. Years later, Kristin returned home, apparently having recovered her memories, and was reunited with him. The details of her later activities in the present (and of her return to the future) remained unrevealed.

The character of Kristin Wells has yet to appear in the current (post- [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]) continuity of DC Comics.
