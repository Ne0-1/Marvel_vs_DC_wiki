'''Superwoman''' is the name given to several [[fictional character]]s published over the years by ''[[DC Comics]]'', most of them being, like the popular [[Supergirl]], a woman with powers similar to those of DC's highly popular [[Superman]].  The name "Superwoman" was originally copyrighted by ''[[Detective Comics]]''.<ref>January 1942</ref> in an effort to prevent competitors for using it.  As was the practice, an [[ashcan copy]] was created with the title of ''Superwoman''. The cover was a reproduction of ''More Fun Comics''<ref>Issue #73</ref> with the interior content reprinting of the third issue.<ref>''Action Comics'' #3 — [http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=11992]</ref> The first true appearance of Superwoman, which is usually thought to have been one of many trial runs for the future introduction of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]] as Supergirl years later, was printed in ''[[Action Comics]]''.<ref name="May '43">Issue #60 — May 1943</ref>

==Versions==
===Lois Lane===
{{main|Lois Lane}}
The appearance of the name "Superwoman" in a DC comic was a story in ''[[Action Comics]]''<ref name="May '43">Issue #60 — May 1943</ref> where [[Lois Lane]] dreams that she has gained superpowers from a [[blood transfusion]] from Superman and launches a career as Superwoman.

The theme would be revisited in a 1947 ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]''<ref>Issue #45, in a story titled "Lois Lane, Superwoman!" — (March-April 1947)</ref> comic in which a pair of fraudulent magicians cast a "spell" on Lane, making her believe she has superpowers. Superman is forced to play along with the ruse for a time, using super-speed to invisibly intervene in Lane's adventures, supporting the illusion. She briefly sports a costume modeled on Superman's before the spell is "broken". A story from ''Action Comics'' has Lois actually gaining superpowers thanks to one of [[Lex Luthor]]'s inventions, and launches a short-lived career as "Superwoman."<ref name>Issue #156 — released May 1951</ref>

Later stories would sporadically feature tales in which Lois gained superpowers and functioned as a "Superwoman" of sorts, but all of these were, like the 1951 tale above, only temporary, with the powers wearing off by the end of the story. A typical example of this is "The Turnabout Powers" from ''[[Superman Family]]'',<ref>Issue #207 (May-June 1981)</ref> where the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] Lois Lane gained powers from her husband (the [[Kal-L|Earth-Two Superman]]) through the unexpected effect of an exotic extraterrestrial plant Superman had brought into their home. The plant's death reversed the effect. Another example would be in the ''[[World's Finest|Batman/Superman: World's Finest]]'' mini-series where [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] briefly transformed Lois into a "Superwoman" with costume and powers.

At the end of ''[[All-Star Superman]]'',<ref>Issue #2</ref> Lois Lane is presented with a formula called "Exo-Genes" created by Superman that allows her to have his powers for 24 hours, and she became Superwoman. During her adventures with her new [[Kryptonian]] powers,<ref>''All-Star Superman'' #3</ref> she was wooed by two superhumans named "[[Samson]]" and "[[Atlas]]", and was captured by a time-Ultrasphinx. Her powers faded away at the end of the day. Notably, her costume seemed to be exactly the same as that of the Anti-Matter Universe's Superwoman (see below), but in Superman's colours; both outfits were designed by [[Frank Quitely]].

===Crime Syndicate of America===
[[Image:Evil Superwoman.jpg|130px|left|The Crime Syndicate of America's Superwoman. Art by [[Frank Quitely]].|thumb]]
In 1964, an evil counterpart of [[Wonder Woman]] from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] named "Superwoman" was introduced. This Superwoman was a member of the [[Crime Syndicate|Crime Syndicate of America]], a villainous counterpart of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] from the parallel world of "[[Earth-Three]]" (vs. the Justice League's world of "Earth-One"). Superwoman, like Wonder Woman, was an [[Amazons|Amazon]], and possessed similar powers of super-strength and flight, had the use of a [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] [[lasso]], only hers could change shape into any form she desired.

The Pre-''Crisis ''version of Superwoman was killed<ref>''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #1</ref> as she was trying to save Earth-Three from being destroyed by the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s antimatter wave. 

In Post-''Crisis'' continuity, as established in the 1998 [[graphic novel]] ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'', Superwoman (and the rest of the Crime Syndicate) comes from a parallel world similar to Earth, but located in an [[antimatter]] universe.

Superwoman continues to make occasional appearances as a member of the Crime Syndicate, most recently appearing in storylines in the Justice League and Superman comics. Unlike her pre-Crisis counterpart, her magic lasso doesn't change shape, but releases the inhibitions of anyone tied with it (just as [[Wonder Woman]]'s compels victims to tell the truth). She also possesses [[heat vision]], as Superman does.

Taking the alias Lois Lane, Superwoman is an [[Amazons|Amazon]] by birth, and has risen through the ranks to become the chief editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' in 'Patriarch's World'. In appearance she resembles Wonder Woman's secret identity of Diana Prince. Superwoman irks her colleagues. For instance, [[Cat Grant|Catherine Grant]] once responded to Earth-1 Superman's inquiry as to her whereabouts, "probably popping little Jenny Olsen's zits"; Cat Grant also refers to Superwoman as "Queen Bitch".<ref>"JLA:Earth-2"</ref>

The only [[civilian]] who knows of Superwoman's secret identity is [[Jimmy Olsen]], who, as a sexual deviant, does what she tells him in exchange for the favour of watching when she changes her outfit and receiving pieces thereof for his "disguise kit". He is so besotted that he ignores her gibes and insults, even when she taunts, "Superwoman's Snitch, Jimmy Olsen. That's what your own Newspaper calls you." -- a reference to his mainstream title of "Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen" (as seen in ''JLA: Earth 2'').

Also in the ''Earth 2'' story, Ultraman hates Superwoman's frigidity towards him. Meanwhile, she is carrying on a torrid affair with [[Owlman (DC Comics)|Owlman]], and they sneak trysts whenever they feel Ultraman is not watching. However, from his floating fortress (The antimatter counterpart to the Fortress of Solitude), Ultraman doesn't hesitate to fire warning bursts of heat vision towards them whenever he catches them together.

In ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' Week 52, an alternate version of [[Earth-Three#New multiverse|Earth-Three]] was shown as a part of the new Multiverse. In the depiction were characters that are altered versions of the original [[Justice Society of America]], including [[Wonder Woman]]. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the two panels in which they appear, but the altered Wonder Woman is visually similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-Three Superwoman.<ref>
{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comic book)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=11 | panel=3-4 }}</ref> This alternative world is discovered to be a reversed version of Earth-2/Two.  Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions.<ref>{{cite web

===Superman's female counterpart===
[[Image:SuperwomanSB.jpg|180px|left|The Superwoman (along with Batwoman and Superlad) from ''Superman/Batman'' #24.|thumb]]
In the volume of the Superman DC [[comic book]] series,<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'', volume 1, #349 (in a story entitled "The Turnabout Trap!")</ref> Superman returns from an interstellar mission to find that everyone on Earth are of opposite sex. Among them are Penny White (a female [[Perry White]]), Jenny Olsen (a female [[Jimmy Olsen]]), Louis Lane (a male Lois Lane), [[Batwoman]] (a female [[Batman]], rather than the actual character), Wonder Warrior (a male [[Wonder Woman]]), Black Condor (a male [[Black Canary]]), and Superwoman (his female counterpart) herself.  Believing he crossed into a parallel universe, Superman flies back to space to find a dimensional portal, but is blocked by an invisible barrier.  He notices the parallelism fails when he sees Superwoman and Clara Kent (Superwoman's presumed secret identity) are two separate people.

After a battle with Superwoman, Superlad (a male Supergirl), and Wonder Warrior, Superman figures out that his foe [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]] is behind this gender-reversed world; Superman discovers as well as that he was never in a parallel universe, but rather on Earth, which Mxyzptlk had altered with his magic. After making Mxyzptlk say his name backwards and thus returning to his native dimension, the effects of Mxyzptlk's magic (including the existence of Superwoman) vanish, returning the Earth to normal.

A new Superwoman named "Laurel", apparently a female version of Superman from a parallel Earth, appeared for the first time in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'',<ref>Issue #23 — released November 2005</ref> and was featured an issue later.<ref>Issue #24</ref> In this Universe, much like in the one featured in "The Turnabout Trap!"), it appears everybody is the same except for reverse gender: there is a Batwoman (female Batman), Superlad (male Supergirl), and a [[Darkseid]] known as the "Dark Queen".  (It is notable that in pre-Crisis continuity, "Laurel Kent" was the name of a 30th century descendant of Superman who occasionally appeared in stories featuring the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], and was replaced in continuity by [[Laurel Gand]].)

Superwoman and Batwoman will return in December 2007 in ''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman'' #1. It will feature their world as part of the new DC Multiverse and will present a male version of Wonder Woman called Wonder Man, based on solicitations.

===Kristin Wells===
{{main|Kristin Wells}}
Another version of Superwoman, this one a heroic character, came about in the form of Kristin Wells, who was created by Superman comic writer [[Elliot S! Maggin]]. Wells first appeared in Maggin's Superman novel ''[[Miracle Monday]]'', but he later introduced her in the pages of [[DC Comics Presents]] as Superwoman. The character Wells is a descendant of [[Jimmy Olsen]] in the 29th century. Wells [[time travel]]s to the 20th century, and the technology she had brought from the future allows her to pretend to have super powers.

===Dana Dearden===
[[Image:SuperwomanDD.jpg|130px|left|The Dana Dearden Superwoman.|thumb]]
Obsessed Superman fan Dana Dearden stole mystic artifacts which granted her the strength of [[Hercules]], the speed (and flight) of [[Hermes]], the thunderbolts of [[Zeus]], and the sight of [[Heimdall]]. Dana donned a green-and-purple uniform,<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #538 — September 1996</ref> with "Superwoman" written down the leggings, and called herself Superwoman, and tried to get Superman to fall in love with her (by kidnapping Jimmy Olsen to get his signal watch). He rejected her advances, and Jimmy called her '''Obsession'''. She vanished attempting to help Superman rescue people from a burning ship. When Superman was split into his Red and Blue energy forms,<ref>''Superman: The Man of Tomorrow'', Issue #10</ref> Superwoman returned hoping that one of the Supermen would return her feelings, but [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] intervened, and used her [[telepathy]] to convince Superwoman that she would destroy Superman with her love. The telepathic illusion wore off<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #574 — released January 2000</ref> and she would try to win Superman over again, this time in a red-and blue costume very similar to his, and claimed to be his wife. She died trying to protect him from demons, since she knew he was vulnerable to magic.

==Other uses==
Various comic stories, pre- and post-Crisis, have offered glimpses of possible futures assuming that one of the various incarnations of Supergirl would eventually change her codename to Superwoman.  One example is a 1980 issue of ''[[Superman Family]]'',<ref>#200 — released April 1980</ref> in which all the stories are set in the then-futuristic 1999 or 2000 (the timeframe is cited only as "the turn of the century") with the characters aged appropriately, including an older Linda Danvers (Kara Zor-El) who divides her time between adventuring as Superwoman and serving as governor of [[Florida]].  Alternately, some stories assume one of Superman's female descendants would assume the name "Superwoman", like his great-granddaughter Lara from ''Superman/Batman: Generations III''.

== In other media ==
A version of Superwoman appeared on ''[[Lois and Clark]]'' in the season three episode, ''Ultra Woman''<ref>November, 12 1995 (Episode 7)</ref>. Clark lost his powers when a red [[kryptonite]] laser beam hit him and transferred his powers to Lois. Both of them were unaware of the transfer, until Lois pulled down an iron gate with her bare hands. Mrs. Kent made her a costume and Clark introduces her to Metropolis as Ultrawoman.
