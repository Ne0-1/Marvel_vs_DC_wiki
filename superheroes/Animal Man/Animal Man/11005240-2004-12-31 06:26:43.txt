'''Animal Man''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].

Originally a typical spandex-clad superhero named Buddy Baker who had the power to borrow the abilities of animals--such as a bird's flight, or a bat's [[animal echolocation|echolocation]]--Animal Man was one of the more obscure of DC's pantheon of heroes.  He debuted in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #180 in [[1965]], with subsequent appearances being both sporadic and sparse -- for example, his main appearances in the [[1980s]] were, appropriately enough, in the company of "The Forgotten Heroes", a team of also-rans that never received a book of their own. 

This all changed in the late 1980s, when DC began employing innovative writers--mostly young and mostly [[United Kingdom|British]]--to reinvent some of their old characters. In the period that saw [[Alan Moore]] reinventing [[Swamp Thing]], and [[Neil Gaiman]] completely recreating [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]], Animal Man was startlingly re-launched by Scottish writer (and ''[[enfant terrible]]'') [[Grant Morrison]].  With the aid of artists Chas Truog and Doug Hazlewood, and cover artist [[Brian Bolland]], Morrison penned the first 26 issues of [[DC Comics]]' revival, published between [[1988]] and [[1989]]. 

Perhaps the series' most memorable moment, and greatest achievement, was Morrison's skillful manipulation and occasional destruction of the "[[fourth wall]]" - the barrier that separates the reader and the protagonist - thus resulting in some of the most extraordinary [[meta-fiction]] ever seen in the medium. (Morrison was to continue blurring the lines between fact and fiction with his most famous work [[The Invisibles]], and later with the [[Vertigo_(comics)|Vertigo]] series ''The Filth'', among others)

His appearance in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC's [[1985]] 12 cross-over event that re-wrote 30+ years of continuity, was widely overlooked at the time, but gave birth to many of the concepts that made Animal Man revolutionary. Morrison's exploration of the themes concerning the puppet/master relationship between protagonist and writer, have their roots in the arbitrary erasure and re-writing of comic book history that '''Crisis''' was symptomatic of. A recurring visual expression of this theme, was of characters in a state of partial erasure - often juxtaposing the artist's pencil drafts with the finished inked and colored art.

Morrison's ''Animal Man'' was initially conceived as a four issue mini-series, but was quickly upgraded into an on-going series. This prompted Morrison to begin laying the groundwork for some of the longest running plots in comics early on in his run -- introducing mysteries in the early issues, for revelation one or two years later was a relatively unusual tactic in the instant-gratification realm of monthly comics. 

Fun as the first four issues were, Animal Man found its voice with #5: "''The Coyote Gospel''". This Gospel's Christ figure, "Crafty", was a thinly-disguised [[Wile E. Coyote]], villain of the [[Road Runner cartoons]]. Weary of the endless cycle of violence to which he and his cartoon compatriots were subject to, Crafty appeals to his cartoonist creator. A bargain is struck, whereby he can end the violence only by willingly being condemned to ''leave'' his cartoon world, entering instead Animal Man's "comic" world. (An interesting maneuver, since Wile's [[Warner Bros.]] is also owned by [[Time Warner]], the real-life parent company of [[DC Comics|DC]]) The issue concludes with a cinematic series of 'pull-back' shots moving from a close-up of Crafty's bleeding body (and curiously-white blood), to the immense cartoonist's hand, filling in Crafty's blood with red paint - a classic instance of "Fourth Wall" destruction. This theme of callous creators toying with the lives of their creations was to continue, particularly Morrison's seeming resistance to the re-writing of Animal Man's history in "Crisis". 

The series was also notable for championing [[vegetarianism]] and [[animal rights]].  In one memorable issue, Buddy helps a band of self-confessed [[ecoterrorism|eco-terrorists]] save a school of [[dolphin]]s. Enraged at one fisherman's brutality, Buddy drops him into the ocean, intending for him to drown. The man is later saved by a dolphin, a nod to Morrison's view of humanity's place in grander scheme of things, and the wider status quo.

The meta-fiction is brought to its logical conclusion in Morrison's final issue, with Morrison fittingly assuming the titular role in the final issue: "''[[Deus Ex Machina]]''", wherein Buddy actually gets to meet Mr Morrison himself. Grant Morrison's run on the series is collected into three trade-paperbacks, entitled: '''Animal Man''', '''Animal Man: Origin of the Species''' (which also includes the ''Secret Origins'' #39 issue on Buddy) and '''Animal Man: Deus Ex Machina'''.

''Animal Man'' continued for another 63 issues, under writers such as [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Jamie Delano]], but never managed to emerge from the colossal shadow cast by Morrison.
