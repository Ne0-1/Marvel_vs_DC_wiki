'''Animal Man''' ('''Bernhard "Buddy" Baker''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]] in the {{DC Universe}}. As a result of being in proximity to an exploding [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] spaceship, Buddy Baker acquires the ability to temporarily “borrow” the abilities of animals (such as a [[bird]]'s [[flight]] or the proportionate strength of an [[ant]]). Using these powers, Baker fights crime as the costumed superhero Animal Man.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book  | last = Greenberger  | first = Robert | author-link =   | contribution = Animal Man | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 16  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Created by writer Dave Wood and artist [[Carmine Infantino]], Buddy Baker first appeared in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #180 (September [[1965 in comics|1965]]) and adopted the name Animal Man in issue #190. Animal Man was a minor character for his first twenty years, never gaining the popularity of other DC heroes such as [[Batman]] or [[Superman]].  He made only five, non-consecutive appearances in ''Strange Adventures'' (four of which were reprinted in ''[[Adventure Comics]]''), followed by two appearances in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', two in ''[[Action Comics]]'', and two in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'', appearing in consecutive issues of each.  These eleven stories constitute the entirety of his pre-Crisis appearances.  However, he became one of several DC properties, such as [[Shade, the Changing Man]] and [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]], to be revived and revamped in the late [[1980s in comics|1980s]] for a more mature comics audience. As seen in ''Strange Adventures #195'', he was billed as a "full time hero", an aspect that would be the most changed by the revamp.

==Publication history==

===Beginnings===
[[File:Strange adventures 195.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Animal Man's original costume. Art by [[Jack Sparling]].]]
Animal Man debuted in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #180 in [[1965 in comics|1965]], in a story written by Dave Wood and drawn by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[George Roussos]]. Animal Man was given his costume and name in ''Strange Adventures'' #190. He continued as a semi-regular feature in the book, making occasional cover appearances, until the introduction of [[Deadman]], who became the main feature with issue #205.  His last appearance was in #201.

His subsequent appearances were sporadic and sparse. In [[1980 in comics|1980]], Animal Man made a notable guest appearance in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' #267-268.

His main appearances in the 1980s were as a member of the "[[Forgotten Heroes]]", a team of minor DC heroes.  It was in that capacity that he appeared in the company-wide crossover event ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

===Grant Morrison revival===
In the late 1980s, following the slate-cleaning ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' event, DC began employing innovative writers, mostly young and mostly from the [[UK]], to revamp some of their old characters. In the period that saw [[Alan Moore]] reinvent [[Swamp Thing]], and [[Neil Gaiman]] do the same with [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]], Animal Man was reimagined by Scottish writer [[Grant Morrison]]. Morrison wrote the first 26 issues of the ''Animal Man'' comic book, published between [[1988 in comics|1988]] and [[1990 in comics|1990]], with art by [[Chas Truog]] and [[Doug Hazlewood]]; [[Brian Bolland]] provided the covers.

Although the series was initially conceived as a four-issue [[limited series]], it was upgraded into an on-going series following strong sales. Consequently, Morrison developed several long-running plots, introducing mysteries, some of which were not explained until a year or two later. The title featured the protagonist both in and — increasingly — out of costume. Morrison made the title character an [[everyman]] figure living in a universe populated by superheroes, [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]], and fantastic technology. Buddy's wife Ellen, his son Cliff (9 years old at the beginning of the series), and his daughter Maxine (5 years old) featured prominently in most storylines, and his relationship with them, as husband, father, and provider, was an ongoing theme.

The series championed [[vegetarianism]] and [[animal rights]], causes Morrison himself supported. In one issue, Buddy helps a band of self-described [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]] save a pod of [[dolphin]]s. Enraged at a [[fishing|fisherman's]] brutality, Buddy drops him into the ocean, intending for him to drown. Ironically, the man is saved by a dolphin.

Buddy fought several menaces, such as an ancient, murderous spirit that was hunting him; brutal, murderous alien Thanagarian warriors; and even the easily defeated red robots of an elderly villain who was tired of life. The series made deep, sometimes esoteric, references to the entire DC canon, including [[B'wana Beast]], [[Mirror Master]], and [[Arkham Asylum]].

Soon after the launch of his series, Animal Man briefly became a member of [[Justice League Europe]], appearing in several early issues of their series.

Following Morrison's run, [[Peter Milligan]] wrote a 6-issue story featuring several surreal villains and heroes, exploring questions about identity and [[quantum physics]] and utilizing the textual [[cut-up technique]] popularized by [[William Burroughs]]. [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Steve Dillon]] then took over for 18 issues in which Buddy returns to his work as a movie [[stunt performer|stuntman]] and explores mystical [[totem]]ic aspects of his powers. [[Jamie Delano]] wrote 29 issues with [[Steve Pugh]] as artist (with occasional issues with by other artists, like [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]]), giving the series a more [[horror fiction|horror]]-influenced feel with a "[[adult comics|suggested for mature readers]]" label on the cover, beginning with issue #51.

====Vertigo====
After [[Jamie Delano]]'s first six issues, wherein, among other things, he killed off the central character of Buddy Baker, created the "Red" (analogous to the "Green" of [[Swamp Thing]]) and resurrected Buddy as an "animal avatar", the series became one of the charter titles of DC's new mature readers [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint with #57, and its ties to the DC Universe became more tenuous. Vertigo was establishing itself as a distinct "mini-universe" with its own continuity, only occasionally interacting with the continuity of the regular DC Universe. The title evolved into a more horror-themed book, with Buddy eventually becoming a non-human animal god. The super-hero elements of the book were largely removed — since Buddy was reborn as a kind of animal elemental, and legally deceased, he discarded his costume, stopped associating with other heroes, and generally abandoned his crime-fighting role. He co-founded the Life Power Church of Maxine to further an environmentalist message, drifting along [[U.S. Route 66]] to settle in Montana. Delano's final issue was #79, culminating in Buddy dying several more times.

Between issues #66 and #67, Delano also penned the ''Animal Man Annual'' #1, focusing on Buddy's daughter Maxine. It was the third part of Vertigo's attempt to create a crossover event titled "[[The Children's Crusade (comics)|The Children's Crusade]]". This event ran across the Annuals of the five then-Vertigo titles --- ''Animal Man'', ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Black Orchid]]'', ''[[The Books of Magic]]'', and ''[[Doom Patrol]]''—book-ended by two ''Children's Crusade'' issues co-written by [[Neil Gaiman]], and starring his [[Dead Boy Detectives]].

A brief run by [[Jerry Prosser]] and Fred Harper featured a re-reborn Buddy as a white-haired [[shamanism|shamanistic]] figure before the series was canceled after the 89th issue due to declining sales.

===Back in the DCU===
After the cancellation of his own series, Animal Man made cameos in several other titles, returning to his standard costumed form.

He has been utilized in most of the recent DC company-wide crossovers fighting alongside other less-mainstream heroes, including  ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', the latter of which co-written by Grant Morrison, as well as ''Justice League of America'' issue #25.

===''The Last Days of Animal Man''===
In 2009 [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Chris Batista]] produced ''The Last Days of Animal Man'', a six-issue limited series telling the tale of Animal Man in the future.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20207 Animal Man R.I.P.?

Gerry Conway on The Last Days of Animal Man], [[Newsarama]], March 13, 2009</ref> The series portrays a middle-aged Animal Man in the year 2024 on his final adventure.

===Relaunch===
As part of [[The New 52]], DC Comics relaunched ''Animal Man'' with issue #1 in September 2011 with writer [[Jeff Lemire]] and artist [[Travel Foreman]].<ref>[http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/06/07/dc-comics-dark-swamp-thing-animal-man DC Comics Announces "Justice League Dark", "Swamp Thing", "Animal Man" and More], ''Comics Alliance'', June 7, 2011</ref><ref name="lemire">{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Vaneta|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/animal-man-jeff-lemire-110608.html|title=Lemire Aims for Less Meta, More Family in DCnU ANIMAL MAN|work=[[Newsarama]]|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

The relaunched ''Animal Man'' has been met with a great deal of critical acclaim.  [[MTV]] Geek said, "I don’t want to oversell this, but if there is a better book put out by DC during the month of September, I will eat the other 51 comics.

According to ICv2.com, the relaunched ''Animal Man'' #1 sold over 55,000 copies, while ''Animal Man'' #2 was one of the 50 best-selling comics in October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/21453.html|title=Top 300 Comics Actual-October 2011|work=ICv2|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/21220.html|title=Top 300 Comics Actual-September 2011|publisher=ICv2|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref>

The storyline of the relaunched version essentially builds on previous Animal Man continuity with Buddy as a happily married family man and superhero. Buddy is forced to take his family on the run after he discovers that his daughter Maxine is the avatar of The Red (the force which sustains all animal life), and that agents of The Rot (the elemental force of decay that are also called The Black) are seeking to kill her.

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis===
Buddy Baker gained animal powers when he encountered a spaceship which blew up, infusing him with radiation. He used his powers to fight crime and ward off alien attackers.

He then joined the [[Forgotten Heroes]] group prior to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].   He was seen with this group during the Crisis.

===Post-Crisis===
Baker's post-Crisis origin was slightly altered, but retained the essence of the original. While hunting as a teenager, he encounters a crashed spaceship which apparently endows him with his abilities (the slight discrepancies between the two stories were addressed as Pre-Crisis and Post-Crisis origins, and were acknowledged in-story, with the "original" Buddy Baker appearing, and not wishing to be written out of existence). After an apparently unsuccessful stint as a superhero, followed by a hiatus where he utilized his powers to work as a film [[stunt performer|stuntman]], Baker decides to restart and make a career out of it after being inspired by the headline-making [[Justice League International]]; this is where his self-titled series begins.

He is married to his high school sweetheart, Ellen, a storyboard artist and, later, an illustrator for children's books. They have two children, Cliff and Maxine, who are a pre-teen and toddler, respectively, when the series starts. They live in a suburban area outside of [[San Diego]].

Through the series, Animal Man becomes a man of great compassion toward all creatures, an ardent animal rights activist, an environmentalist, and a vegetarian. Later, he finds his link to the M-field has been passed on to his daughter, Maxine, who is also connected to the animal kingdom. Although he wears a mask, he goes to no great lengths to conceal his true identity. A jacket was added to Animal Man's costume (so he could have pockets and a place to put his keys as well as notes from his wife). However, this jacket was denim and not a leather jacket: Buddy specifically discusses that he will not wear leather, out of moral considerations.

An early aspect of the character was his desire for fame, and is manifested by his wish to be in the [[Justice League]]. He is initially driven by a desire for the publicity from interviews and public appearances more than any altruistic impulse. Buddy joins the newly formed [[Justice League Europe]] and bonds with [[Rocket Red|Dmitri]] of the [[Rocket Red Brigade|Rocket Reds]] over the shared experiences of being fathers.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 1) #24 (February 1989)</ref> However, he soon resigns due to tragic events taking place later in his series.<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #12 (March 1990)</ref>

After a brief period of reconditioning and exploration of his limits, Baker's first work is a job from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] investigating a break-in at an animal testing facility. He traces it to the hero [[B'wana Beast]], who he is able to befriend and aid. The conditions he witnesses at the testing facilities compel him to become vegetarian, a sudden decision that briefly puts him at odds with his family. Baker also becomes a staunch animal rights activist and goes on several missions with environmental themes.

During his further adventures, he experiences glitches with his powers. He also begins experiencing evidences of his existence within a comic book, although he does not immediately understand them for what they are. He is targeted for murder by a mysterious organization upset with his environmental work, and must face the new [[Mirror Master]]. Baker is also pursued by Dr. James Highwater, a physicist with no memory of any prior existence, and seemingly no purpose other than to contact Baker. A parallel story involves a pair of yellow aliens (described as "agents of some unspecified 'higher power'" that engineered the spaceship wreck which granted his powers) who are aware of the events of the Crisis and monitor Baker's actions. They are aware of "a second Crisis" coming which they believe only Animal Man can revert. They reconcile the two variations of Animal Man's origin through an unexplained "surgery" which also extends his abilities. Elsewhere, in [[Arkham Asylum]], the [[Psycho-Pirate]], aware of "[[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]" and his fictional environment, opens a gateway into the real world and other comic book realities and begins bringing several characters no longer in continuity into existence.<ref>[http://www.io.com/~woodward/chroma/crtanimal.html WPage / Crisis-Relevant Text: Animal Man<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Baker is demoralized, however, when firefighters are injured in a laboratory blaze started by activists he was working with. He is approached by Highwater just as he decides to give up his costumed identity. While away on a [[vision quest]] with Highwater, in which he learns the true nature of his powers and briefly sees the comic's reader, Baker's family is brutally murdered by an assassin sent by the corporate heads seeking to stop his environmental work. With the help of [[Mirror Master]], who had turned down the hit, Baker tracks down the businessmen and assassin and kills them. While trying to undo his family's deaths with a time machine, Baker accidentally becomes warped through time and meets the [[Phantom Stranger]], [[Etrigan the Demon#Jason Blood|Jason Blood]], and the [[Immortal Man]] in the 1960s, who help him learn to accept his grief. Baker is then contacted by the aliens and taken to Arkham, where he stops the Psycho-Pirate and prevents damage to the continuity. Baker is transported to limbo and encounters several comic book characters not being used in stories. Ultimately, Baker encounters his own writer ([[Grant Morrison]] himself), and the two share a conversation on the relationship between the creator and the fictional characters whose lives they write. After this encounter, Baker is sent back home and his family are restored back to life; it is left ambiguous as to whether or not Baker remembers the full nature of these events.

Next, after falling into a [[coma]], he finds himself in a strange alternate reality, which he correctly deduces is a divergent phase of existence and is then able to return home.

Having since left the Justice League, Baker resumes his stuntwork career. He also finds himself frequently displaying uncontrolled animalistic behavior. He is assaulted by a neighbor, Travis Cody, a [[Burnout (stereotype)|burnout]] with a PhD in [[electronic engineering]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Cody has deduced that Baker's powers have become skewed, and that unfocused usage of his abilities kills the animals. After reaching an understanding, the two work together to measure and enhance Animal Man's powers. They are themselves targeted by a group of [[shaman]]s, one of whom was present at Animal Man's origin, and who are aware of the yellow aliens and the writer. During this time, Baker's daughter Maxine begins demonstrating powers similar to his own, and is able to communicate with the head shaman, who is attempting to bring Baker to him.

S.T.A.R. Labs again contacts Baker, offering a position as their [[spokesman]] on [[environmentalism]], but he declines. After an accident in which Baker kills the entire population of the [[San Diego Zoo]], his wife takes their daughter to live with her mother in [[Vermont]] to avoid the media attention. Baker descends into a [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and his son runs away, eventually ending up with an uncle, a lecherous predator. Baker goes to Vermont as well, where he finally meets the shaman. Meanwhile, Cody has been hired by S.T.A.R. Labs for his expertise, and while there he uncovers a conspiracy involving one of the shamans but is mentally trapped in [[cyberspace]].

Baker continued to split his time between his family, his career as Animal Man, and regular stunt work for films. He occasionally lent his talents to various super groups, including the JLA, Forgotten Heroes, and played a prominent role in the Swamp Things's task force, Totems.<ref>[[Tom Peyer]]'s [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] ''Totems''</ref>

===Post-series===
This marked the reappearance of Buddy in costume, and heralded his return to the mainstream [[DC Universe]] (although his Vertigo appearances were clearly meant to take place inside the DCU as well). He subsequently appeared alongside [[Aquaman]], [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], and [[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]].<ref>''Resurrection Man'' #24-27 (May–August 1999)</ref> In JLA #27 (March 1999) Buddy officially joins the League to battle a rampaging [[Amazo]] in the Florida Everglades; however, since Amazo was able to mimic the powers of any and all members of the League, they were only able to defeat Amazo by disbanding the League. Buddy does not stay for the reorganization. During a JLA [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] event, Animal Man's expertise in the morphogenetic field assists the League.<ref>''JLA'' #40 (April 2000)</ref>

Animal Man also makes an appearance in the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' limited series, helping to search for the murderer of [[Sue Dibny]].

After encountering danger signs from the animal world, Animal Man is recruited by [[Donna Troy]] as part of a team journeying to New Cronos to stop the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', mirroring his role in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', in which he journeyed into space with the [[Forgotten Heroes]] on [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s ship. During this adventure, he formed a mentoring friendship with the new [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], Jason Rusch.

Due to a malfunction of the zeta beam which Adam Strange deploys to return the team to Earth, Animal Man, along with most of the heroes, go missing after ''Infinite Crisis''. Eventually some of the heroes are recovered but Adam Strange, Buddy, and Starfire are still missing. They become core cast members of DC's weekly series ''52''.

===''52''===
{{Main|52 (comics)}}
In ''52'', Animal Man, [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], and [[Adam Strange]] are stranded on an alien planet. The trio escape, but are pursued by bounty hunters. They are joined by [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. In issue #36, during a battle with [[Lady Styx]] and her horde, Animal Man is killed by a necrotoxin, which causes its victims to rise again in the service of Lady Styx. Animal Man makes Starfire promise not to let him come back as a zombie. He gestures to the reader, saying, "Look, they're cheering us on. I told you the universe likes me." At the moment of his death, Ellen, still on Earth, senses his death and begins to cry.

In issue #37, moments after Starfire and Adam Strange leave Animal Man in space, Buddy comes back to life. The aliens who originally granted his powers stand next to him, saying: "And so it begins." After plucking him out of the timestream and repairing his body, they leave him in outer space. Animal Man must reach out to another life form in order to survive, and claims the abilities of a group of [[Sun-Eater]]s, including their homing sense. He observes his wife from a wormhole in space provided by the aliens, only to discover that Ellen is seeing another man (though it is later revealed she only reluctantly went out with one of Buddy's friends).

Buddy returns to Earth, describing the marvels of space to his delighted family.  Ellen throws a party to celebrate his return, but some followers of Lady Styx appear, bent upon killing the family. They are eliminated by Starfire, who has only partially recovered from wounds suffered in space. She delivers Buddy's jacket and faints from weakness and surprise when she sees him alive, leaving the family to care for her.

===Countdown to Adventure===
Animal Man joined Adam Strange and Starfire in the series titled ''[[Countdown to Adventure]]'' written by Adam Beechen. The first issue reveals that his family has been caring for Starfire, who still has not regained her powers. Buddy convinces Ellen to let Starfire stay and act as a nanny to his two children. When a strange form of madness infects the people of San Diego, he and Starfire team up to stop it. Buddy's closeness to Starfire has made Ellen disgruntled, and thinks that Buddy is in love with her. Buddy's powers have been in a state of flux, not working at all at times, and manifesting strange abilities at others, such as creating a whirlwind, or firing energy beams. Once their extraterrestrial trip is done, Starfire leaves the Baker home, telling them that they will always be in her heart.

===Anansi===
In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #25, Buddy is drawn into [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]'s animal totem and captured by the trickster god [[Anansi]], who claims to be the one who gave Buddy his powers, having disguised himself as the aliens (whilst reminding Vixen and Buddy that he constantly lies). Anansi also mentions that Buddy's new powers were a side effect of his manipulation of Earth's morphogenic field.

===Cry for Justice===
Buddy appears in the second half of writer [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]]'s event miniseries ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]''. While he and his family are entertaining Starfire and [[Donna Troy]], Buddy is approached by [[Mikaal Tomas]] and [[Congorilla]], who ask him for help in tracking down the supervillain [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]]. He accompanies them to the [[Justice League Watchtower|JLA Watchtower]] to seek help from the Justice League, and is present when [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] is mauled by an unknown attacker.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #5 (November 2009)</ref> While searching for Red Arrow's assailant, Buddy is assaulted and brutally injured by [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]], who ultimately turns out to be Prometheus in disguise.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #6 (January 2010)</ref>

During the finale, Buddy is seen helping Starfire and Firestorm rescue survivors after [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] is destroyed by Prometheus.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #7 (March 2010)</ref>

===Blackest Night===
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, [[Nekron]], lord of the dead, reveals that all those who have returned from the dead, such as Buddy, were allowed to do so, in order to become his "inside agents". A [[Power ring (DC Comics)|black power ring]] attaches itself to Buddy, canceling out his resurrection and transforming him into a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)</ref> In the final battle, Animal Man is freed by the power of white light.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>

===Starman/Congorilla===
Following the events of ''Blackest Night'', Buddy helps Starman and Congorilla during their search for the [[Fountain of Youth]], using his abilities to help translate for [[Rex the Wonder Dog]].<ref>''Starman/Congorilla'' one-shot (March 2011)</ref> Buddy is later revealed to be a member of the JLA's reserve team, and joins the League during their battle against [[Eclipso]].

===The New 52===
{{Very long section|date=March 2014}}
In [[The New 52]], Buddy Baker had spent less time being a hero and returned to his role as an environmental activist. He also took up acting when where he appeared in an Indie drama about a washed-up superhero named "Tights" with his passion being superheroics. Buddy later started to suffer strange nightmares about three monstrous figures known as the Hunters' Three and his own daughter Maxine soon started to manifest powers of her own where she could seemingly resurrect dead animals.<ref>''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #1 (November 2011)</ref> When Buddy and his wife Ellen discover this, Maxine tells them that they have been calling her from a certain place and points to the red tattoo on Buddy's chest referring to The Red. When their neighbor Mr. Duffy starts to notice the revived pets of the Baker Family, Maxine retaliates by turning Mr. Duffy's hands into bird talons until Ellen tells Maxine to change them back followed by Mr. Duffy running off. Buddy and Maxine then travel throughout California until they come to a tree that sucks them to The Red. Meanwhile, three hippopotamuses have given birth to the Hunters' Three, assume the form of three zookeepers, and prepare to hunt Buddy and Maxine.<ref>''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #2 (December 2011)</ref> While in The Red, Buddy and Maxine find themselves face-to-face with a group of massive animal men called the Totems. The Hunters' Three then split up where two of them head into The Red while the third one heads off to capture Ellen. The Totems welcome Buddy as Maxine identifies them as the old Animal Men since they've been coming to her in her dreams. As Maxine is an avatar of The Red like the other Totems were, Buddy wasn't. Thus, the Totems give Buddy the identity of Animal Man so that she can train Maxine for the upcoming battle between The Red and The Black (AKA The Rot). Buddy tells them that Maxine is 4 years old and isn't old enough to fight in any of the wars. The Totems state that she has no other choice. Both The Red and The Green must be ready to fight The Black. Suddenly, the Totems are alerted to the presence of Two of the Hunters' Three. While Buddy faces off against two of the Hunters, the third one escapes and possesses Detective Krenshaw where he meets up with Ellen at the diner.<ref>''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #3 (January 2012)</ref> When Animal Man is being outmatched by the two Hunters, Maxine ends up coming to the rescue where she uses her abilities to fend them off. When Ellen arrives at the house of her mother Mary Frazier, the third Hunter struggles to maintain his form. After Maxine heals Animal Man, the Totems tell them that the Hunters' Three were formerly Avatars of the Red until their job was done and ended up led astray by The Black. Since the other Avatars of the Red are dead, the Hunters' Three are now planning to target Maxine and Animal Man must protect her. While the ones that are associated with The Green can help Animal Man, a Cat Totem named Ignatius (under the alias of Socks the Cat) goes with Animal Man and Maxine despite the cost of being unable to return to the Parliament of the Limbs.

==Powers and abilities==
Buddy can mimic any abilities of any animal as a result of his encounter with a crashed alien [[spacecraft]]. He does this by either focusing on a specific animal near him, or, as he learned later, by drawing power from the animal kingdom in general (this enables him to even mimic animals that are extinct). The nature of these powers has been described in various ways, including the superficial "alien radiation" explanation of his early appearances, the reconstruction of his body by aliens with "morphogenetic grafts" at the cellular level, and currently, mystical access to a "[[morphogenetic field]]" created by all living creatures, also known as "the Red". He does not grow wings to fly as a bird (instead he flies in classic "[[Superman]] style"), nor does he form [[gill]]s to breathe underwater when mimicking a fish, but he has occasionally been known to mimic the actual appearances of animals, such as adopting the claws of a [[wolverine]] temporarily, or his metamorphosis toward the end of Delano's run on his series.

Among the "animal powers" Buddy has been known to use are:

* The strength of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus Rex]]''.
* The flight of a [[bird]].
* The swimming ability of a [[fish]].
* The speed of an [[ant]].
* The reflexes of a [[fly]].
* The eloquence of a [[parrot]].
* The wall-crawling of a [[spider]].
* The sonic blast of a [[Alpheidae|pistol shrimp]].
* The sense of smell of a [[moth]].
* The stench of a [[skunk]].
* The color changing of a [[chameleon]].
* The agility of a [[snake]].
* The playfulness of a [[Cat|kitten]].
* The electricity of an [[electric eel]] and [[electric ray]].
* A [[worm]]'s ability to re-grow lost body parts.
* The righteous anger of a mother [[bear]].
* The bark of a large [[dog]].
* The reproduction abilities of [[protozoa]].
* The durability of a [[cockroach]].
* The ability to "fire lightning from his face" from an [[Lightning Lad|unidentified alien creature]].
* The beauty of a [[Monarch butterfly|Monarch Butterfly]].
* The smell of a [[hippopotamus]].
* The napping ability of a [[cat]].

The level of Buddy's abilities is proportional to the size of the animal they are drawn from. Hence, drawing the jumping ability from a [[flea]] would allow him to cover great distances. However, taking the abilities of a larger animal does not result in diminished power for him. In some appearances, he can also talk to animals and enter their minds.

Tapping into the Red, Animal Man can also fire blasts of force or unidentified energy. In cooperation with [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and the woman known as "Tristess", he helped to create an entire universe.<ref>''Animal Man'' (vol. 1) #48-50 (June–August 1992)</ref>

In ''52'', Buddy experiences an upgrade that allows him to connect to the Universe's morphogenetic field, providing him unlimited access to all animals in the universe regardless of origin. At first, Animal Man knew nothing about the alien creatures whose abilities he took, but later has ample knowledge.
