'''Animal Man''' is a fictional [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].  It is also the title of a comic book series, published from 1988 to 1995, which featured the character's adventures.

==History==

The character was originally a typical spandex-clad superhero named '''Buddy Baker''' who, as the result of being in proximity to an exploding alien spaceship, has the power to borrow the abilities of animals, such as a bird's flight, or a bat's [[animal echolocation|echolocation]].  He debuted in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #180 in [[1965]], with subsequent appearances being both sporadic and sparse,  His main appearances in the [[1980s]] were as a member of the "Forgotten Heroes", a team of minor heroes that were never featured in series of their own.

==1980s==

In the late 1980s, following the slate-cleaning ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' event, DC began employing innovative writers - mostly young and mostly [[United Kingdom|British]] - to reintroduce and/or revamp some of their old characters. In the period that saw [[Alan Moore]] reinventing [[Swamp Thing]], and [[Neil Gaiman]] completely recreating [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]], Animal Man was re-imagined by Scottish writer [[Grant Morrison]].  With artists [[Chas Truog]] and [[Doug Hazlewood]], and cover artist [[Brian Bolland]], Morrison wrote the first 26 issues of ''Animal Man'' comic book, published between [[1988]] and [[1990]]. 

The series was initially conceived as a four issue mini-series, but was quickly upgraded into an on-going series. This prompted Morrison to begin laying the groundwork for some long-running plots.  He introduced mysteries in the early issues, some of which were not explained until a year or two later, a relatively unusual tactic especially at the time.  It featured the protagonist both in and - increasingly - out of costume.  His wife Ellen, his son Cliff (10 years old at the beginning of the series), and his daughter Maxine (6 years old) featured prominently in most storylines, and his relationship with them - as husband, father, and provider - was an ongoing theme in the series.

A recurring theme of Morrison's run was the manipulation and occasional deconstruction of the "[[fourth wall]]" - the imaginary barrier that separates the reader from the setting of the story - and the relationship between characters and their creators.  One visual expression of this theme was of characters in a state of partial erasure - often juxtaposing the artist's pencil drafts with the finished inked and colored art.  The series was famous for containing the only overt references to the various Earths of the pre-Crisis DC [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] during a time in which DC editorial policy stipulated that they didn't exist.  The culmination of this storyline is Animal Man's discovery that they are all a fictional characters, and he even meets Grant Morrison, the callous "god" who controls his life.

One of the most acclaimed issues of this run was issue #5: "The Coyote Gospel". This story featured "Crafty", a thinly-disguised [[Wile E. Coyote]] (of the [[Road Runner cartoons]]). Weary of the endless cycle of violence to which he and his cartoon compatriots were subject to, Crafty appeals to his cartoonist creator. A bargain is struck, whereby he can end the violence only by willingly being condemned to ''leave'' his cartoon world, entering instead Animal Man's "comic" world. The issue concludes with a cinematic series of "pull-back" shots moving from a close-up of Crafty's bleeding body (and curiously-white blood), to the immense cartoonist's hand, filling in Crafty's blood with red paint.

The series was also notable for championing [[vegetarianism]] and [[animal rights]], causes Morrison himself supported.  In one memorable issue, Buddy helps a band of self-confessed [[ecoterrorism|eco-terrorists]] save a school of [[dolphin]]s. Enraged at one [[fishing|fisherman's]] brutality, Buddy drops him into the ocean, intending for him to drown. The man is later saved by a dolphin, a nod to Morrison's view of humanity's place in the grander scheme of things, and the wider status quo.

Morrison's run on the series is collected into three paperback editions, entitled: ''Animal Man'', ''Animal Man: Origin of the Species'' (which includes the ''Secret Origins'' #39 story), and ''Animal Man: Deus Ex Machina''.

Following Morrison, [[Peter Milligan]] wrote a 6-issue run featuring several surreal villains and heroes,  exploring questions about identity and quantum physics.  [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Steve Dillon]] then took over for 18 issues in which Buddy goes to work as a movie [[stuntman]] and explores mystical [[totem]]ic aspects of his powers.  [[Jamie Delano]] wrote 29 issues with [[Steve Pugh]] as artist, giving the series a more horror-influenced feel with a "suggested for mature readers" label on the cover.  During this period the series became one of the charter titles of DC's new [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, and its ties to the DC Universe became more tenuous, with Buddy eventually becoming a non-human animal god.  A brief run by [[Jerry Prosser]] and [[Fred Harper]] featured Buddy as a [[shaman]]istic figure before the series was cancelled due to declining sales.

== After Cancellation ==

Animal Man returned to being a third string character after the cancellation of his titular book, but he has not disappeared.  On the [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] side, he was one of the lead characters in [[Tom Peyer]]'s one-shot ''Totems''.  In the [[DC Universe]], he has appeared alongside [[Aquaman]], [[Hawkman]] and [[Resurrection Man]]. During a JLA [[Annual publication|annual]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] event, the [[Martian Manhunter]] sought out Animal Man's expertise in the morphogenetic field to assist the League. This appearance also cast doubt on whether or not ''The Coyote Gospel'' is in continuity. 

He made an appearance in the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, helping to search for the murderer of [[Sue Dibny]].

Animal Man has currently been recruited by [[Donna Troy]] as part of a team journeying to [[New Cronos]] to try and help stop the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

==Powers and Abilities==

Buddy can mimic any abilities of any animal, either by focusing on a specific animal near him, or, as he learned later, by drawing power from the animal kingdom in general.  The nature of these powers has been described in various ways, including the superficial "alien radiation" explanation of his early appearances, the reconstruction of his body by aliens with "morphogenetic grafts" at the cellular level, and mystical access to the "morphogenetic field" or "the Red". He does not have to use wings to fly as a bird, or gills to breath as a fish underwater, but occasionally he has been known to mimic the actual appearances of animals, such as adopting the claws of a wolverine temporarily, or his metamorphosis toward the end of Delano's run on his series.

Among the "animal powers" Buddy has been known to use the strength of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the flight of any bird, the swimming ability of any fish, the speed of an ant, the wall-crawling of a spider, the jumps of a flea, the sonic blast of a pistol shrimp, the sense of smell of a moth, the stench of a skunk, the color changing of a chameleon, the agility of a snake, the electricity of an electric eel, the worm's ability to replace lost bodyparts, and the reproduction abilities of bacteria.  He can also talk to animals and enter their minds.
