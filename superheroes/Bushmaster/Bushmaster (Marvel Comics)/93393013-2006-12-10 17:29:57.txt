'''Bushmaster''' is the name of two [[Marvel Comics]] supervillains, who happen to be brothers of each other.

== Bushmaster I ==
The first Bushmaster was a powerful crime boss. He oftenly confronted the super-hero [[Iron Fist]] and is best known for his attempts to lure [[Misty Knight]] to his side. Misty even faked a relationship once in an attempt to bring Bushmaster down. In an attempt to exact revenge on Knight, he hired [[Luke Cage]] to kidnap her and bring her to him. As added incentive, he promised evidence that Cage was framed for the heroin possession charge he was imprisoned for, as well as holding Claire Temple and Noah Burstein hostage. Bushmaster forced Burstein to mutate him as he had Cage, but was nonetheless defeated and soon became paralyzed by the process. Bushmaster later died in battle, and his code-name was later honored by his younger brother, Quincy.

== Bushmaster II==

Bushmaster is a quadriplegic who possesses cybernetic limbs: two arms and a tail in the place of the lower half of his body. He lost his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to evade the police underwater. Shortly later, [[Roxxon Oil]] Company equipped him with bionic arms and a snake-like tail. He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother, the first Bushmaster. Years later, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] enlisted Bushmaster to join the criminal trade union known as the [[Serpent Society]]. Bushmaster was grateful for the unity and the steady employment. 

After all, he considered himself to be a freak, and the Society was his best chance in life. In fact, he made a friend in [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], a fellow Society member that saved him after [[M.O.D.O.K.]] severed his artificial appendages. After the Viper took over the Society, Bushmaster remained loyal to Sidewinder. However, Sidewinder, disillusioned by the betrayals of some of the Serpents, turned over control of the guild to the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], and Bushmaster served him next. At Diamondback's trial, he voted to spare her life from a death sentence. After the trial, Bushmaster fought Diamondback, and next, [[Captain America]]. He was finally taken into custody.
