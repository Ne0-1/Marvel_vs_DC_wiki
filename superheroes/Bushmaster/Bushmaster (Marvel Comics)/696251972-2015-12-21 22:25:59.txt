John McIver was a powerful crime boss, criminal financier and organizer, and the brother of Quincy McIver. As a teenager, John and Quincy grew up on an unidentified island in the Caribbean Sea. Unlike Quincy, John was quick and savvy enough to stay out of trouble despite stealing from the local [[merchant]]s. After John found out that Quincy blurted out that they were brothers to a [[shopkeeper]] who had caught him, John gave Quincy a beating. A few nights later, John beat the shopkeeper to death. Years later, John was in the employ of Herve Argosy where he worked as his muscle man in his gun-extorting business. John got Quincy in with Herve Argosy, buy Quincy got all four limbs chopped off by a motorboat propeller on the first mission. John visited Quincy in the hospital to mock his misfortune. John McIver then took on the name John Bushmaster and headed off to Europe to run some of Argosy's trade there.<ref name="Captain America #10">''Captain America Annual'' #10</ref>

Several years later, John Bushmaster managed to take over the European branch of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. As he began to show interest into expanding into the United States starting with New York, he attracted the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and [[Interpol]] where they have failed to infiltrate his organization. New York's [[district attorney]] sent [[Misty Knight]] to take a stab at it under the alias of Maya Korday. She did so successfully. Bushmaster returned early from his press conference and warmly greeted Maya at the Cutlass Bay resort on the Caribbean island of Ste. Emile.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #15</ref>

Bushmaster agreed to put a hit out on [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] for a man named Shrieve. Hearing this, Maya lost it and used her bionic arm to force Bushmaster into telling her where the hit was going to take place. Maya then made her way to the boat where Bushmaster plans to see her dead.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #63</ref>

Bushmaster sent his agents to capture [[Claire Temple]] and Noah Burnstein. Bushmaster summoned [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] to his mansion at [[Lake Michigan]] where he showed them the videos of the hostages and threatened to kill them if they didn't bring Misty Knight to him. In exchange, Bushmaster offered to give them videotapes provided by Gadget that would prove his innocents for the crimes that Luke Cage was initially framed for. To make sure that Power Man followed his offer, Bushmaster sent Shades and Commanche to follow them.<ref name="Power Man #49">''Power Man'' #49</ref> Power Man ended up fighting Misty Knight, [[Colleen Wing]], and Iron Fist. When Luke Cage was seemingly defeated by Iron Fist, Shades and Commanche reported this to Bushmaster.<ref>''Power Man'' #48</ref> At Seagate Prison, Bushmaster coerced Noah Burnstein into utilizing the "Power Man" process on him to an even greater extent that was used on Luke Cage. Power Man, Iron Fist, Misty Knight, and Colleen Wing fought Bushmaster at Seagate Prison where Bushmaster proved to be powerful than Luke Cage. In the course of the battle, Power Man and Bushmaster pierced a chemical vat where they were doused in chemicals where were then electified by a torn power line. When the explosion in the room where Power Man and Bushmaster were in happened, it was thought that Bushmaster was dead.<ref name="Power Man #49"/>

Bushmaster's transformation proved to be too great where his body was transformed into unliving metal. While he still can move, Bushmaster had his agents capture Noah Burnstein's wife Emma so that Noah can try to reverse the process on Bushmaster. Bushmaster formulated a plot to capture Power Man and bring him to Seagate where Noah can use him as a guinea pig. When Power Man and Iron Fist were fighting bank robbers, both of them were gassed as Power Man is brought to Seagate. Virtually immobile, Bushmaster watched as Noah Burnstein began the process. When Iron Fist arrived and shattered the tank to rescue Power Man, Bushmaster reached for the switch to tell his men to kill Emma Burnstein. As they did, the process was accelerated as Bushmaster was left in an immobile inert steel form less than an inch from the switch. His body then began to crumble leaving only a metal skeleton sitting there.<ref>''Power Man'' #67</ref>

Bushmaster's son Cruz Bushmaster had his father's remains taken to an island fortress off the coast of St. Croix so that he can have Noah Burnstein resolve the safety issues in the "Power Man" process. Cruz Bushmaster had his father's remains and Luke Cage placed in a chamber to absorb the negative effects of the "Power Man" process. John Bushmaster was revived by the energies and took over Cruz's body. John Bushmaster in Cruz' body goes by the name Power Master and attacks Luke Cage. In the nick of time, Iron Fist arrived and freed Luke Cage from Power Master's grip. Luke Cage then puts a power cable into Power Master who ends up soaking up the energy like a sponge. As Power Master started absorbing too much energy, Luke Cage and Iron Fist escaped while Cruz Bushmaster's fortress exploded.<ref>''Cage'' #12</ref>

Quincy McIver was born on a Caribbean island and is the younger brother of the first Bushmaster. He became a quadruple amputee when he lost his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to evade the police underwater.<ref name="Captain America #10"/>

Shortly later, the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] equipped him with bionic arms and a snake-like tail in the place of the lower half of his body. He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother. Years later, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] enlisted Bushmaster to join the criminal trade union known as the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref> Bushmaster was grateful for the unity and the steady employment. After all, he considered himself to be a freak, and the Society was his best chance in life. In fact, he made a friend in [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], a fellow Society member.

In his first mission with the Serpent Society, he was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] to hunt down [[MODOK]]. MODOK severed Bushmaster's artificial appendages, and Diamondback saved Bushmaster's life.<ref>''Captain America'' #312-313</ref> He soon received new bionic arms.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>

After the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took over the Society, Bushmaster remained loyal to Sidewinder. He was poisoned by the Viper, but was saved by [[Captain America]] and Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342</ref> He then participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]]. He withdrew from combat against the [[X-Men]] to repay his debt to Diamondback.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13</ref>

Sidewinder, disillusioned by the betrayals of some of the Serpents, had turned over control of the guild to the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], and Bushmaster served him next.<ref>''Captain America'' #365 (December 1989)</ref> At Diamondback's trial, Bushmaster voted to spare her life from a death sentence.<ref>''Captain America'' #367 (February 1990)</ref> After the trial, Bushmaster fought Diamondback, and next, Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. He was finally taken into custody.<ref>''Captain America'' #380-382</ref> He was later released from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref name="Captain America #10"/>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event, Bushmaster, like many other villains, was apprehended by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to join [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He briefly appears along with fellow Serpent Society members [[King Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]] and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104</ref>

[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #13</ref> including [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]],  [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. Bushmaster is apparently killed by Kraven and left face down in the water aboard the sinking ship.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #14-15</ref>

Later, several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth, fought members of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale. He was defeated by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]] and [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #73</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Bushmaster was seen with the Serpent Society where they were robbing a bank until they are defeated by [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Bushmaster had street-fighting skills. He later went through the same process that gave Luke Cage his powers which gave him superhuman strength and durability. As Power Master, he can absorb energies from other people.

The second Bushmaster was given bionic prosthetic limbs and a tail attached through surgery courtesy of the Roxxon Oil Company and Brand Corporation. His long, snake-like, superhumanly strong bionic tail enables him to move and strike at superhuman speed. He has two {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} "fangs" strapped to the back of each of his hands, which are needle sharp at the tips and contain a fast-acting poison derived from snake venom.

===In other media===
* The Quincy McIver version of Bushmaster appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episodes "Ultron-5", "Along Came a Spider...", and "Yellowjacket." He is a member of the [[Serpent Society]].
