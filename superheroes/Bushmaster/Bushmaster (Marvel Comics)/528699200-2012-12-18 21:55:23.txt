===Fictional character biography of Quincy McIver===
Quincy McIver was born on a Caribbean island and is the younger brother of the first Bushmaster. He became a quadruple amputee when he lost his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to evade the police underwater. Shortly later, the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] equipped him with bionic arms and a snake-like tail in the place of the lower half of his body. He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother. Years later, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] enlisted Bushmaster to join the criminal trade union known as the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref> Bushmaster was grateful for the unity and the steady employment. After all, he considered himself to be a freak, and the Society was his best chance in life. In fact, he made a friend in [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], a fellow Society member.

In his first mission with the Serpent Society, he was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] to hunt down [[MODOK]]. MODOK severed Bushmaster's artificial appendages, and Diamondback saved Bushmaster's life.<ref>''Captain America'' #312-313</ref> He soon received new bionic arms.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>

After the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took over the Society, Bushmaster remained loyal to Sidewinder. He was poisoned by the Viper, but was saved by [[Captain America]] and Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342</ref> He then participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]]. He withdrew from combat against the [[X-Men]] to repay his debt to Diamondback.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13</ref>

Sidewinder, disillusioned by the betrayals of some of the Serpents, had turned over control of the guild to the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], and Bushmaster served him next.<ref>''Captain America'' #365 (December 1989)</ref> At Diamondback's trial, Bushmaster voted to spare her life from a death sentence.<ref>''Captain America'' #367 (February 1990)</ref> After the trial, Bushmaster fought Diamondback, and next, Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. He was finally taken into custody.<ref>''Captain America'' #380-382</ref> He was later released from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #10</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event, Bushmaster II, like many other villains, was apprehended by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to join [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He briefly appears along with fellow Serpent Society members [[King Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]] and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104</ref>

[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #13</ref> including [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] II, [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II, [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] III, [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. Bushmaster is apparently killed by Kraven and left face down in the water aboard the sinking ship.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #14-15</ref>

Later, several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth, fought members of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale. He was defeated by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]] and [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #73</ref>

===Powers and abilities of Quincy McIver===
The second Bushmaster was given bionic prosthetic limbs and a tail attached through surgery courtesy of the Roxxon Oil Company and Brand Corporation. His long, snake-like, superhumanly strong bionic tail enables him to move and strike at superhuman speed. He has two {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} "fangs" strapped to the back of each of his hands, which are needle sharp at the tips and contain a fast-acting poison derived from snake venom.

===Quincy McIver in other media===
