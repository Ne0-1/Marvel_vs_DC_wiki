===Fictional character biography===
John McIver was a powerful crime boss, criminal financier and organizer, and was oft-confronted by the super-hero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].  McIver is best known for his attempts to lure [[Misty Knight]] to his side. Misty even faked a relationship once in an attempt to bring Bushmaster down. In an attempt to exact revenge on Knight, he hired [[Luke Cage]] to kidnap her and bring her to him. As added incentive, he promised evidence that Cage was framed for the heroin possession charge he was imprisoned for, as well as holding Claire Temple and Noah Burstein hostage. Bushmaster forced Burstein to mutate him as he had Cage, but was nonetheless defeated and soon became paralyzed by the process. Bushmaster later died in battle when he was turned into a metal-like substance<ref>Power Man and Iron Fist #66</ref>, and his code-name was later honored by his younger brother, Quincy.

===Fictional character biography===
Quincy McIver was born on a Caribbean island. He became a quadruple amputee when he lost his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to evade the police underwater. Shortly later, the [[Roxxon Oil]] Company equipped him with bionic arms and a snake-like tail in the place of the lower half of his body. He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother, the first Bushmaster. Years later, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] enlisted Bushmaster to join the criminal trade union known as the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref> Bushmaster was grateful for the unity and the steady employment. After all, he considered himself to be a freak, and the Society was his best chance in life. In fact, he made a friend in [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], a fellow Society member. 

In his first mission with the Serpent Society, he was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] to hunt down [[MODOK]]. MODOK severed Bushmaster's artificial appendages, and Diamondback saved Bushmaster's life.<ref>''Captain America'' #312-313</ref> He soon received new bionic arms.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>

After the [[Madame Hydra|Viper]] took over the Society, Bushmaster remained loyal to Sidewinder. He was poisoned by the Viper, but was saved by [[Captain America]] and Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342</ref> He then participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]]. He withdrew from combat against the [[X-Men]] to repay his debt to Diamondback.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13</ref>

Sidewinder, disillusioned by the betrayals of some of the Serpents, had turned over control of the guild to the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], and Bushmaster served him next. At Diamondback's trial, Bushmaster voted to spare her life from a death sentence. After the trial, Bushmaster fought Diamondback, and next, Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. He was finally taken into custody.<ref>''Captain America'' #380-382</ref> He was later released from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #10</ref>

==== Civil War ====
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
During the Civil War event, Bushmaster II, like many other villains, was apprehended by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to join [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He briefly appears along with fellow Serpent Society members [[King Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]] and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104</ref>

[[Alyosha Kravinoff|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #13</ref>, including [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)#Kangaroo (Brian Hibbs)|Kangaroo]], [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]], [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)#Buford Lange|Leap-Frog]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. In the end, the Punisher managed to sabotage this zoo; though Kraven himself escaped to the [[Savage Land]].

===Powers and abilities===
Bushmaster was given bionic prosthetic limbs and a tail attached through surgery courtesy of the Roxxon Oil Company and Brand Corporation.  His long, snake-like, superhumanly strong bionic tail enables him to move and strike at superhuman speed. He has two {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} "fangs" strapped to the back of each of his hands, which are needle sharp at the tips and contain a fast-acting poison derived from snake venom.
