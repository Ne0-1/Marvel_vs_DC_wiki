'''Bushmaster''' is the name of two fictional supervillains appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first was a master criminal, while the second Bushmaster was given super powers as he had a long, mechanical snake tail grafted to his torso and bionic arms.

==Publication history==
The first Bushmaster (John McIver) first appeared in ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' vol. 1 #15 (September, 1977) created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. John McIver, known as John Bushmaster, became a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime boss in Europe and later expanded into the United States. In the United States he was confronted by [[Misty Knight]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]. Due to an accident during a fight with Power Man Bushmaster was transformed into "Unliving metal", which later lead to his death.

The second Bushmaster (Quincy McIver), first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310 (October, 1985), created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]]. Quincy McIver, younger brother of John, lost both his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to avoid the police. The [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] used their resources to graft bionic arms to Quincy's body and replace his severed legs with a long bionic snake tail, transforming him into Bushmaster. He became a founding member of the Serpent Society, finding acceptance among the team. He would remain loyal to Society leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] when [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took control of the Serpent Society. He was not shown to be a member of Serpent Solutions when the Society was reorganized.

John McIver was a powerful crime boss, criminal financier and organizer, and the brother of Quincy McIver. As a teenager, John and Quincy grew up on an unidentified island in the Caribbean Sea. Unlike Quincy, John was quick and savvy enough to stay out of trouble despite stealing from the local [[merchant]]s. After John found out that Quincy blurted out that they were brothers to a [[shopkeeper]] who had caught him, John gave Quincy a beating. A few nights later, John beat the shopkeeper to death. Years later, John was in the employ of Herve Argosy where he worked as his muscle man in his gun-extorting business. John got Quincy in with Herve Argosy, but Quincy got all four limbs chopped off by a motorboat propeller on the first mission. John visited Quincy in the hospital to mock his misfortune. John McIver then took on the name John Bushmaster and headed off to Europe to run some of Argosy's trade there.<ref name="Captain America #10">''Captain America Annual'' #10</ref>

Several years later, John Bushmaster managed to take over the European branch of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. As he began to show interest into expanding into the United States starting with New York, he attracted the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and [[Interpol]] where they have failed to infiltrate his organization. New York's [[district attorney]] sent [[Misty Knight]] to take a stab at it under the alias of Maya Korday. She did so successfully. Bushmaster returned early from his press conference and warmly greeted Maya at the Cutlass Bay resort on the Caribbean island of Ste. Emile.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #15</ref>

Bushmaster agreed to put a hit out on [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] for a man named Shrieve. Hearing this, Maya lost it and used her bionic arm to force Bushmaster into telling her where the hit was going to take place. Maya then made her way to the boat where Bushmaster plans to see her dead.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #63</ref>

Bushmaster sent his agents to capture [[Claire Temple]] and [[Noah Burstein]]. Bushmaster summoned [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] to his mansion at [[Lake Michigan]] where he showed them the videos of the hostages and threatened to kill them if they didn't bring Misty Knight to him. In exchange, Bushmaster offered to give them videotapes provided by Gadget that would prove his innocence for the crimes that Luke Cage was initially framed for. To make sure that Power Man followed his offer, Bushmaster sent Shades and Commanche to follow them.<ref name="Power Man #49">''Power Man'' #49</ref> Power Man ended up fighting Misty Knight, [[Colleen Wing]], and Iron Fist. When Luke Cage was seemingly defeated by Iron Fist, Shades and Commanche reported this to Bushmaster.<ref>''Power Man'' #48</ref> At Seagate Prison, Bushmaster coerced Noah Burnstein into utilizing the "Power Man" process on him to an even greater extent that was used on Luke Cage. Power Man, Iron Fist, Misty Knight, and Colleen Wing fought Bushmaster at Seagate Prison where Bushmaster proved to be more powerful than Luke Cage. In the course of the battle, Power Man and Bushmaster pierced a chemical vat and were doused in chemicals which were then electrified by a torn power line. Bushmaster was believed killed in the resulting explosion.<ref name="Power Man #49"/>

Bushmaster survived and his body continued to mutate, transforming into unliving metal. While he still could move, Bushmaster had his agents capture Noah Burnstein's wife Emma to force Noah to reverse the process. His agents also captured Power Man and brought him to Seagate to be used as a guinea pig. Virtually immobile, Bushmaster watched as Noah Burnstein began the process. When Iron Fist arrived and shattered the tank to rescue Power Man, Bushmaster reached for a signal switch to order his men to kill Emma Burnstein, but as he did, his transformation accelerated and left him in an immobile inert steel form less than an inch from the switch. His body then began to crumble leaving only a metal skeleton.<ref>''Power Man'' #67</ref>

Bushmaster's son Cruz Bushmaster had his father's remains taken to an island fortress off the coast of St. Croix so that he can have Noah Burnstein resolve the safety issues in the "Power Man" process. Cruz Bushmaster had his father's remains and Luke Cage placed in a chamber to absorb the negative effects of the "Power Man" process. John Bushmaster was revived by the energies and took over Cruz's body. John Bushmaster in Cruz' body goes by the name Power Master and attacks Luke Cage. In the nick of time, Iron Fist arrived and freed Luke Cage from Power Master's grip. Luke Cage then puts a power cable into Power Master who ends up soaking up the energy like a sponge. As Power Master started absorbing too much energy, Luke Cage and Iron Fist escaped while Cruz Bushmaster's fortress exploded.<ref>''Cage'' #12</ref>

Quincy McIver was born on a Caribbean island and is the younger brother of the first Bushmaster. He became a quadruple amputee when he lost his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to evade the police underwater.<ref name="Captain America #10"/>

Shortly later, the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] equipped him with bionic arms and a snake-like tail in the place of the lower half of his body. He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother. Years later, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] enlisted Bushmaster to join the criminal trade union known as the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #310. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bushmaster was grateful for the unity and the steady employment. After all, he considered himself to be a freak, and the Society was his best chance in life. In fact, he made a friend in [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], a fellow Society member.

In his first mission with the Serpent Society, he was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] to hunt down [[MODOK]]. MODOK severed Bushmaster's artificial appendages, and Diamondback saved Bushmaster's life.<ref>''Captain America'' #312-313</ref> He soon received new bionic arms.<ref>''Captain America'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took over the Society, Bushmaster remained loyal to Sidewinder. He was poisoned by the Viper, but was saved by [[Captain America]] and Diamondback.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]]. He withdrew from combat against the [[X-Men]] to repay his debt to Diamondback.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Sidewinder, disillusioned by the betrayals of some of the Serpents, had turned over control of the guild to the [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]], and Bushmaster served him next.<ref>''Captain America'' #365 (December 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> At Diamondback's trial, Bushmaster voted to spare her life from a death sentence.<ref>''Captain America'' #367 (February 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> After the trial, Bushmaster fought Diamondback, and next, Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. He was finally taken into custody.<ref>''Captain America'' #380-382. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was later released from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref name="Captain America #10"/>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event, Bushmaster, like many other villains, was apprehended by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to join [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He briefly appears along with fellow Serpent Society members [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|King Cobra]] and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]] later began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol.2 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> including [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]],  [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]] (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], [[Man-Bull]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], [[Frog-Man]], and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. Bushmaster is apparently killed by Kraven and left face down in the water aboard the sinking ship.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol. 2 #14-15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth, fought members of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale. He was defeated by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]] and [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #73. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]" storyline, Bushmaster was seen with the Serpent Society where they were robbing a bank until they are defeated by [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] initiative, Bushmaster appears as a member of Viper's Serpent Society under its new name of Serpent Solutions.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Bushmaster appears in the 2017 "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline where he and the rest of the Serpent Society are members of the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref> He alongside Puff Adder and Viper attack a woman in the woods when she is saved by a bearded haggard man in a World War II uniform that introduced himself as Steve Rogers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He has two {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} "fangs" strapped to the back of each of his hands, which are needle sharp at the tips and contain a fast-acting poison derived from snake venom.{{issue|date=May 2017}}
