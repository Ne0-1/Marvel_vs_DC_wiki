'''Magpie''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain|super-villainess]] created by [[John Byrne]], who first appeared in the miniseries, [[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]''.

She is notable for her outlandish [[1980s in fashion|1980s style]] including a unique [[mohawk hairstyle#Bi-hawk (Twin Fins) & Tri-hawk|tri-hawk]]/[[mohawk hairstyle#Mullet|mullet hairstyle]] (Although in ''Man of Steel'' #3, Superman reveals that her unique hairstyle is a wig, and she was actually a redhead) as well as an exotic, red and silver costume consisting of large [[sunglasses]], [[earrings]], long gloves, and [[fishnet stockings]]. 

==History== 
First appearing in ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' #3 and later in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #401, Magpie was a jewel [[thief]] who specifically targeted jewels named after birds and then replaced them with booby trapped replicas.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Barbara J.

Taking a job as a museum curator she is slowly driven mad surrounded by the beautiful things she so loves but can never own. She was described by Batman in ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' #3  Magpie's first appearance, as "a girl who loved shiny things - a little too much." It was a problem with her [[kleptomania]], and her schoolmate's taunts of "magpie" coupled with her unfortunate birth name of "Margaret Pye".

Although Magpie's first appearance in ''Man of Steel'' had her facing Superman and Batman in their very first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] team-up, she was rarely used again. She also had a brief affiliation with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] who both escaped from [[Arkham Asylum]]. 

In [[Superman/Batman]] #2 (2003), Superman mentions thinking about Magpie and wonders what happened to her, to which Batman says he is "reasonably" sure she is dead. The same year, however, Magpie appears in the maxiseries ''[[Arkham_Asylum#Arkham_Asylum:_Living_Hell|Arkham Asylum: Living Hell]]''.

As of [[One Year Later]], Magpie is dead, having been murdered by [[Tally Man]] along with [[Orca (comics)|Orca]], The [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist and Scarface]], and [[KGBeast]], villains working for [[The Penguin]].

====Blackest Night====
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Magpie is among the many deceased villains that receive a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] and is reanimated into a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]].<ref name="bn1">''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1</ref>

==In other media==
In the ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' animated movie, she was mentioned by Superman asking what happened to her. Batman states that she died before the movie. Superman replied "Why don't the good villains ever die?" to which Batman replies "Clark, what the hell are good villains?"
