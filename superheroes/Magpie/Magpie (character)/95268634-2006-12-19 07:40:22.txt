==History== 
First appearing in [[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]] #3 and later in ''Batman'' #401, Magpie was a jewel [[thief]] who specifically targeted jewels named after birds, and then replacing them with booby trapped replicas. She is named for the [[Magpie]], who, in folklore is attracted to bright shiny things. 

Although largely a minor character, Magpie appeared in ''Superman'' mini series ''Man of Steel'' #3 as the supervillain which Superman and Batman fought in their first [[Post-Crisis]] team-up.

She also had a brief affiliation with [[Poison Ivy]] who both escaped from [[Arkham Asylum]]. 

As of [[One Year Later]], Magpie is dead, having been killed, along with [[Orca (comics)|Orca]], The [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist and Scarface]], and [[KGBeast]], villains working for [[The Penguin]].
