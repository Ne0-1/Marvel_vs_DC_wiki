'''Magpie''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain|super-villainess]] who made several appearances in the ''[[Superman]]'' sister title ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel|Man of Steel]]''.

She is notable for her outlandish [[1980s in fashion|1980s style]] including a unique [[mohawk hairstyle#Bi-hawk (Twin Fins) & Tri-hawk|tri-hawk]]/[[mohawk hairstyle#Mullet|mullet hairstyle]] (Although in ''Man of Steel'' #3, Superman reveals that her unique hairstyle is a wig, and she was actually a redhead) as well as an exotic, red and silver costume consisting of large [[sunglasses]], [[earrings]], long gloves, and [[fishnet stockings]]. While perhaps highly dated, this look has remained her trademark even into the [[2000s]].

==History== 
First appearing in ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' #3 and later in ''Batman'' #401, Magpie was a jewel [[thief]] who specifically targeted jewels named after birds and then replaced them with booby trapped replicas. She is named for the [[Magpie]], who, in [[folklore]] is attracted to bright, shiny objects. 

Although largely a minor character, Magpie's first appearance in ''Man of Steel'' had her facing Superman and Batman in their very first [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] team-up. She also had a brief affiliation with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] who both escaped from [[Arkham Asylum]]. 

In [[Superman/Batman]] #2, Superman mentions thinking about Magpie and wonders what happened to her, to which Batman says he is "reasonably" sure she is dead.

As of [[One Year Later]], Magpie is dead, having been murdered by [[Tallyman]] along with [[Orca (comics)|Orca]], The [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist and Scarface]], and [[KGBeast]], villains working for [[The Penguin]].
