'''Hardball''' ('''Roger Brokeridge''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was created by writer [[Dan Slott]] and artist [[Stefano Caselli]], and first appeared in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1 (June 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
Roger Brokeridge<ref>Full name revealed in ''Avengers: The Initiative #4</ref> (a.k.a. '''Hardball''') is one of the new Initiative recruits who arrives with [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], [[MVP (comics)|MVP]], [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], and others.  He appears to have a very outgoing personality, hitting on [[Thor Girl]] on the bus ride in and cracking a joke about not having a cape when receiving his fatigues<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref>. He also tries to convince Komodo and Cloud 9 to go out to a bar with him, even though he is two weeks short of his 21st birthday<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref>. <!--[[Image: This image should contain one or more characters produced by Marvel contracted artist(s]]--> During the training mishap with [[Armory (comics)|Armory]] he exhibits the ability to create an energy ball that deflects the lethal blasts from Armory's Tactigon.  He attempts to capitalize on his new position by wearing a costume and flaunting his abilities at a bar in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]. Understandably, the patrons are less than happy to see a [[New Warriors|"grandstanding kid superhero"]], and are on the verge of attacking him, until a man in a suit rescues him.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3"/> In return, the suited man has Hardball steal a [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. Tech]] dart magazine from the weapon stores for him and replace it with a facsimile. Ironically, that same magazine is the one Iron Man attempts to use to defeat the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] during the events of [[World War Hulk]]<ref>''[[World War Hulk]]'' #1</ref>. Upon realizing what he has done, Hardball is overcome with guilt<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref>.

It is later revealed that Roger was given his powers by the [[Power Broker]]. Hardball was then forced to work for the Power Broker, and was ordered to rob an armored car. He used his new powers to knock the car down while coincidentally a little girl entered the street at that time, in the path of  the car. [[Wonder Man]], who just happened to be flying by misinterpreted this as an act of heroism, and swiftly recruits him into the Initiative. The Power Broker then sold his "contract" to [[HYDRA]], whose commander is the man who saved him in the bar, Congressman Woodman, which means HYDRA has a double-agent within the Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1</ref>

Roger enters into a romantic relationship with Komodo.{{issue}}

When he completed his training, Hardball was assigned to [[Nevada]]'s Initiative team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> He appears with the [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]], including [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], Nonstop, and Telemetry, helping the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] and [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] deal with a [[Skrull]] posing as an unnamed team member during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]''. He then leaves with Komodo, 3-D Man, and the Krew to help the other Initiative teams.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #17</ref>

After Secret Invasion, Hardball's status as an agent for HYDRA led to a confrontation against the rest of the Heavy Hitters and a visiting Komodo. Hardball kills Congressman Woodman, effectively becoming the new leader of HYDRA. This ends his relationship to the Initiative and a saddened Komodo.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The full extent of his powers is unrevealed. He appears to be able to create balls of energy that he can use as a defensive shield (presumably they can also be used offensively). These energy balls can be quite powerful, since they managed to deflect energy blasts from Armory (which previously had pierced through [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]]'s armor). He can also create electro-magnetic balls of energy that can momentarily scramble electronic locks and cameras. He has not told The Initiative the full extent of his powers.
