'''Vulcan''' ('''Gabriel Summers''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appears in ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #1, and was created by [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]]. He is the son of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] and younger brother of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]. He was recently revealed as being a "[[Third Summers brother]]".

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
[[Image:Vulcan.PNG|thumb|124px|left|Vulcan's infant body is aged to adolescence through the Shi'ar incubation-accelerator. Art by [[Trevor Hairsine]].]]
Vulcan's history began on the [[Shi'ar]] throneworld, as the unborn child of [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher]] and Katherine Summers (parents of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]]). Katherine was [[pregnant]] when the Summers were abducted by [[D'Ken]], Majestor of the [[Shi'ar]] Imperium, and her child was seemingly killed when the mad emperor, in retaliation for an attempt by Corsair to escape, stabbed Katherine and killed her. The infant Vulcan was removed from Katherine's lifeless body and placed in an incubation-accelerator, used to breed new slaves, aging him to the prime [[adolescence]].

Sent to Earth to become a slave for [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]], the Emperor's hand on Earth, he escaped to be found by [[Moira MacTaggert]] with little or no memories of who he was or where he came from. She took him as her ward, and instructed him in the use of his nascent powers. He claimed his name was Gabriel, but he chose the code name of Vulcan from a book on [[Roman mythology]], and [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] recognized his mental imprint as being related to Cyclops. He became part of a team of [[X-Men]] formed by [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Sway (comics)|Sway]] that attempted to rescue the original X-Men from [[Krakoa]]. Feeling Vulcan as a menace, Krakoa sent a human shaped volcano to deal with his team, killing the two girls and leaving Darwin and Vulcan for dead.

===Deadly Genesis===
With the help of his dying teammates, Vulcan was able to survive. Reawakened in modern days by the mutant energies released during [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], he returns from his space exile to get revenge against [[Professor Xavier]], killing [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] in the process, as well as attempting to kill Logan and even kidnapping [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].

Vulcan subconsciously uses the absorbed powers of Petra and Sway to manipulate the X-Men, and figures out the truth of the mystery behind the missing team of X-Men that were lost on Krakoa. Vulcan is able to lure Professor Xavier out of hiding, and confronts him in front of the X-Men, wanting the Professor to reveal to them all what really happened to Vulcan and his team. However, Xavier is unable to do so, due to the fact that, in the wake of M-Day, he is no longer a Mutant. Enraged, Vulcan commands Marvel Girl to link their minds so that everyone can see what transpired. Reluctantly, Rachel does so, and with Xavier as a guide, she is able to not only reveal the truth behind what really happened on Krakoa, but she also detects another consciousness within the mind of Vulcan.

It is revealed that Vulcan and his team rescued Scott from Krakoa (it was previously thought that Krakoa itself released Scott to bring it more victims), and Vulcan was able to hurt the living island, which greatly enraged the creature. Vulcan revealed to Cyclops that they were in fact brothers, and sent Cyclops away on their jet to safety. As the jet took off, Cyclops watched in horror as the living island struck down and seemingly killed Vulcan and his team. Sway was hit first, and severed in two at her torso. Her body released the last of her mutant power to slow time down around them. As Petra was incinerated, she also reacted reflexively and drew them all below the surface into a cave that her power created. There, Vulcan and Darwin lay dying, and Darwin transformed himself into energy and bonded with Vulcan, thus saving them both. They were launched into space along with the Krakoa land mass by [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] and remained inert until the massive backlash of power resulting from [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] awakened Vulcan.

After the apparent death of Vulcan and his team, Cyclops returned to Professor Xavier in a hysterical state, blaming himself for their deaths, and the Professor decided it was best for all involved if he altered their memories to forget about Vulcan and his team, and spare everyone the agony. With these revelations, Marvel Girl reaches into Vulcan's mind and releases the subconscious inert form of Darwin, which Vulcan expels from his body. Using this opportunity, the X-Men attack him as they deem him too dangerous to be left alone. Vulcan easily repels their attack and flees the planet, renouncing Cyclops as his brother, and heads for space with the vision of D'Ken killing his mother raging in his mind, bent on revenge.

===The Rise and Fall of The Shi'ar Empire===
[[Image:Uncannyxmen483 large.PNG|Vulcan with Deathbird, D'Ken, and the Shi'ar. Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #483, by John Watson.|thumb]]
While traveling through Shi'ar space, he learns from a crew member whose starship he had destroyed that [[D'Ken]] has been comatose for years after his experience in the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] and that [[Lilandra Neramani]] is the current ruler of the Shi'ar. Undaunted, Vulcan continues on his quest for vengeance by engaging a trio of Shi'ar warships, and destroying two of them, thereby showing his superiority to the crew of the surviving third ship, which Vulcan then commandeers for his own. After reaching the inner territory of the Shi'ar throneworld, Chandilar, the ship is confronted and ordered to surrender by the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].  However, the captain of Vulcan's ship had deceived Vulcan as to the Guard's true strength, hoping to use him as a pawn in [[Chancellor|Vice-Chancellor]] [[K'Tor]]'s plan to restore the old Empire; as a result, Vulcan is unprepared for the true power of the Guard, and especially their leader, [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]].

Vulcan kills several powerful guardsmen in combat (Titan, Neutron, Cosmo, Smasher, and Impulse, among many others), but is defeated by Gladiator, and taken to a prison moon. He remains a prisoner there until an agent of the Vice-Chancellor frees him from his shackles, and directs him to another cell to free [[Deathbird]].

However, soon afterwards, Deathbird manages to convince him to at least delay his plan for vengeance, after the two become romantically involved. Vulcan then uses his powers to heal [[D'Ken]]'s injuries. Afterwards, a grateful D'Ken asks Vulcan to marry Deathbird. After his wedding, Vulcan throws Professor Xavier into the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], kills D'Ken, and names himself [[Emperor]] of the Shi'ar. Darwin leaps into the Crystal after Xavier, and soon after emerges with him. During the battle Vulcan [[Patricide|kills Corsair]], claiming he doesn't have a father and blaming Corsair for letting his mother die. Now with Xavier's [[Decimation (comics)|lost telepathy restored]] by the Crystal, he, along with Nightcrawler, Warpath, Darwin, and Hepzibah, are sent back to Earth by Lilandra locking the ship's programming. Meanwhile, Havok, Marvel Girl, Polaris, [[Ch'od]], [[Raza Longknife|Raza]], and [[Korvus (comics)|Korvus]] form a new team of Starjammers bent on defeating Gabriel once and for all, and salvaging the remains of the crippled Shi'ar Empire.

===Emperor Vulcan===
The civil war between Vulcan's forces and those loyal to the dethroned Lilandra rages on.  Led by Havok and the Starjammers, Lilandra's forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan's forces, which are plagued by defections.  The Shi'ar, contrary to Vulcan's expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler.  Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him.

Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather's Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers.  However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, is destroyed by the Scya'r Tal (translates as "Death to the Shi'ar"). Vulcan and Gladiator attack the leader of the Scy'ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi'ar space.

Marvel Girl makes contact with the Eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the M'Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi'ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M'Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra & K'ythri. The M'Kraan then changed their named to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi'ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.

==Powers and abilities==
Vulcan's energy manipulation powers allow him to manipulate a potentially unlimited number of energy fields and sources. This is often used to produce light, heat, force, and electricity, as well as warp or disable existing energy sources, tap into and suppress mutant energies, survive in the vacuum of space, and fly. He can also use the powers of others by manipulating the energy in their brain. When he uses his powers, his eyes glow, which is possibly a homage to his nephews [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[X-Man]]. [[Emma Frost]], [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Professor Xavier]] have confirmed him to be beyond an [[Omega-level mutant]]. However "Beyond Omega" is possibly a mistake by writer Ed Brubaker, since Omega-level already denotes unlimited potential. Most recently, he has been confirmed as an Omega-level mutant in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #483, his powers elevated to said level thanks to absorbing a massive amount of mutant energies from [[M-Day]]. 

After being swallowed by the soil of [[Krakoa]], he absorbed the powers of his teammates [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], Petra, and Sway, giving him their powers of super adaptation, earth manipulation, and time manipulation respectively. Once separated from Darwin's essence by Rachel Grey, Vulcan appears to have lost these added powers. From then on, he has utilized his original energy manipulation powers.

All three Summers brothers have similar powers, as they are each able to absorb certain kinds of extraterrestrial energies and rechannel that energy from their bodies. Remarkably enough, while his brothers Alex and Scott are known to be immune to each others powers (presumably because of their blood relation), they are apparently not immune to Vulcan's (he manages to hurt Scott with no apparent trouble).
