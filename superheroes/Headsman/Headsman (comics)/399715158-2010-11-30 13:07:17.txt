'''Headsman''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

== Fictional character biography==
=== Origin ===
The Headsman is a criminal who first appeared to field test technology devised by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. He was sent to help the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] escape from [[Spider-Man]], which he accomplished by forcing Spider-Man to flee. [[Harry Osborn]] alerted Spider-Man to the criminals' meeting place, and the Headsman was forced to flee after the ensuing battle after Spider-Man damaged his power pack.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #8</ref> After repairing his pack, Headsman teamed with Lucky Lobo to kill Spider-Man. Believing he had killed Spider-Man, he left the hero buried under a pile of rubble. Facing Spider-Man again, he was assaulted by the Green Goblin, who revealed himself to Headsman as his employer. The Green Goblin destroyed the Headsman's equipment and knocked him out, allowing Spider-Man to turn him over to the police.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #18</ref>

=== Thunderbolts ===
Years later, the Headsman joined Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] black ops team. He helped discredit [[Doc Samson]] by attacking Air Force One disguised as the Green Goblin. Osborn saved the President in a staged attack by tossing the faux "Green Goblin" from the plane.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #128-129</ref> The team's next objective was to kill [[Deadpool]], at which they failed miserably.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 4 #8-9</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #130-131</ref> His teammate the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] revealed to him that the gravity-grip he used on his first mission was faulty and that he had fixed it, suggesting that Osborn had meant for him to die in his fall from the plane.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #132</ref> He battled new teammate [[Mister X (Marvel Comics)|Mister X]], but was spared from death by the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #134</ref> When the Thunderbolts capture [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] and Natasha Romanov, they are ordered to execute them. However, the consciences of Headsman, Ghost and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] get the better of them; they allow the prisoners to escape, knocking out their teammates and erasing their memories of the event.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136</ref> 

==== Death ====
The [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Uranian]] of the [[Agents of Atlas]] later implants a suggestion in the mind of [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Scourge]] to execute Osborn when he next sees him; after the mission, a hologram of Obsorn appears before the Thunderbolts, which triggers Scourge to shoot, but the bullet goes through the hologram and hits Headsman in the head.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #140</ref>
