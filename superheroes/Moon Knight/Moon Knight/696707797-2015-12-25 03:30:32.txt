'''Moon Knight''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Don Perlin]], the character first appeared in ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32 (August 1975).

==Publication history==
The character debuted in the title ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32 (August 1975), written by [[Doug Moench]] with art by [[Don Perlin]], as an enemy of the title character in a two-part story continuing in issue #33. The character proved popular with readers, and was granted a solo spot in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #28–29 (1976), written by Doug Moench with art by Don Perlin.

He then had appearances in ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' issues #22 and #23 (September/October 1978), both written by [[Bill Mantlo]] with art by [[Mike Zeck]] on #22 and [[Jim Mooney]] on #23; ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #52, written by [[Steven Grant]] with art by [[Jim Craig (comics)|Jim Craig]]; and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #47–50. Moon Knight then gained a backup strip in the ''Hulk! Magazine'' in issues #11–15, #17–18, and #20, as well as ''Marvel Preview'' #21 (on which he was the cover feature), all written by Doug Moench. Art was done by [[Gene Colan]] in #11, [[Keith Pollard]] in #12, and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] on the rest. These were reprinted in ''Moon Knight Special Edition'' #1–3.

A new ongoing series was then launched (November 1980), titled ''Moon Knight'', which also had writing by Doug Moench and art by Bill Sienkiewicz. With issue #15 (January 1982), Marvel pulled the series from newsstand distribution, resulting in it being only available through direct market purchase at comic book stores. The series continued until #38 (July 1984), at which point the comic was cancelled. A new series, ''Moon Knight – Fist Of Khonshu'' by Alan Zelenetz and Chris Warner followed the cancellation to try and establish a new status quo, but it was cancelled after six issues. Afterwards, the character was incorporated into the pages of ''West Coast Avengers'' from issue #21 through issue #41 and Annuals #1–3. After an appearance in ''Punisher Annual'' #2 in 1989, the character was once more given an ongoing series, this time titled ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight''. At the time, Moon Knight also had a major guest star role in the pages of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', as ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #353–358 served as the conclusion to an ongoing storyline in the pages of the character's title, as far as the character's war with the [[Secret Empire]]. The series was canceled with issue #60 (March 1994), with four of the last six issues drawn by [[Stephen Platt]], who was hired by Image Comics based on the strength of his work on the series. Two one-shots, ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight Special Edition'' #1 and ''Moon Knight: Divided We Fall'' were published during the run of the title, followed in January 1998 and January 1999 by two further four-issue [[limited series]], which resurrected the character who had died in the final issue of the 1989 series.

A ''Moon Knight'' ongoing series was launched in April 2006, written by [[Charlie Huston]] with art by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=38948 Huston Talks Moon Knight], [[Newsarama]], July 25, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5488 Dark Side of the Moon Knight: Huston talks "Moon Knight: The Bottom"], [[Comic Book Resources]], August 8, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6312 Waxing Moon Knight: Huston talks "Moon Knight"], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 1, 2006</ref> As of issue 14 of this series, [[Mike Benson (screenwriter)|Mike Benson]] took over writing duties<ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/11885380822002.htm Mike Benson: Of Moon Knight and Redemption], [[Comics Bulletin]], August 31, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/120466700781781.htm Bring on the Knight: An Interview with Moon Knight's Mike Benson], [[Comics Bulletin]], March 4, 2008</ref> with Huston acting as story-outline adviser according to Benson in an interview with Marvel published as a one-page excerpt in various Marvel comic books throughout late 2007 and early 2008.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Peter Milligan]] also wrote a 2008 seasonal one-shot "Moon Knight: Silent Knight" with artist [[Laurence Campbell]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18868 O Holy Knight: Milligan on Moon Knight Xmas Special], [[Comic Book Resources]], November 18, 2008</ref>  The 2006 series ended with issue #30 (July 2009), and only one Annual in the series was printed in 2008.

That series was followed by a ten-issue series titled ''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'', beginning in September 2009, written by [[Gregg Hurwitz]] and drawn by Jerome Opena.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21663], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 19, 2009</ref> After ''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' was canceled, Moon Knight was placed in the team book ''Secret Avengers'' (appearing for the title's first 21 issues), in the ''Shadowland'' three issue storyline and in a 2010 relaunch of ''Heroes for Hire''.

It was announced at the New York Comic Con that 2011 would see the launch of a new ''Moon Knight'' series by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Alex Maleev]], which Bendis has described as a "complete reinvention of the character on every conceivable level."<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=29174</ref> This volume launched in May 2011 and ended with issue #12 in April 2012.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=36560</ref>

In March 2014, Marvel launched a new ongoing series as part of the All New Marvel NOW! initiative. Totaling 17 issues, the series was later released in 3 trade paperbacks of '''''From The Dead''''' (Issues #1 - #6), '''''Dead Will Rise''''' (Issues #7 - #12) and '''''In The Night''''' (Issues #13 - #17). The series emerges another aspect to the character in the form of a suited and booted, ''Mr. Knight.'' 

The second 2014 - 2015 initiative was a new compilation series, the full-color '''''EPIC Collection'''''. The series includes '''''Volume 1: Bad Moon Rising''''' (''2014,'' 504 pages) covering the period 1975 - 1981 and '''''Volume 2: Shadows of The Moon''''' (''2015'', 512 pages) covering the period 1981 - 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://marvel.com/comics/collection/52999/moon_knight_epic_collection_shadows_of_the_moon_trade_paperback|title = Marvel EPIC Collection|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>  

A new '''''Moon Knight''''' series written by Jeff Lemire and artist Greg Smallwood will debut in 2016. The series is planned to have a large focus on the psychological issues, the mental scarring and multiple identity issues suffered by superheroes, associated with having an alter ego as a ''<nowiki/>'super hero''<nowiki/>' and what being a superhero entails while simultaneously undertaking a 'normal life' as a member of society.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A New Moon Knight Rises {{!}} News {{!}} Marvel.com|url = http://marvel.com/news/comics/25171/a_new_moon_knight_rises|website = marvel.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> Lemire has detailed to delve deeper into this aspect showing sides to Spector and Moon Knight yet to be fully explored.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/comics/25171/a_new_moon_knight_rises</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Born in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], '''Marc Spector''' is an [[United States|American]] [[rabbi]]'s wayward son. As an adult, Spector has been a heavyweight boxer, a U.S. Marine, and a [[mercenary]]. He becomes a strong and skilled combatant and befriends the [[France|French]] [[aviator|pilot]] Jean-Paul DuChamp, whom he calls "[[Frenchie (comics)|Frenchie]]". While working for the African mercenary [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]] in Egypt, the group stumbles upon an [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig whose crew includes Dr. Peter Alraune and his daughter Marlene. The dig had uncovered an ancient temple where artifacts included a statue of the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] moon god [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]]. Intent on looting the dig, Bushman kills Dr. Alraune. In response to Alraune's murder, Spector challenges Bushman to personal combat and defeats Bushman, but is left to die in the sub-zero temperatures of the desert night.

[[File:Moon knight issue 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Moon Knight'' <!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> #1<br/> Art by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]].]]
Roaming Egyptians who worship the ancient Egyptian gods find Spector and carry him to their temple. Helpless before the statue of Khonshu, Spector's heart stops. Khonshu appears to him in a [[Vision (religion)|vision]], offering Spector a second chance at life if he becomes the god's avatar on Earth. Spector awakens, wraps himself with the silver shroud that covers Khonshu's statue, and again confronts Bushman. He defeats Bushman and returns to America with [[Marlene Alraune]], Frenchie, and the statue of Khonshu. Deciding to become a crimefighter, Spector creates a silver cloaked costume, based on the silver shroud, and becomes the Moon Knight.

After his return to the United States, Spector invests the money that he had accumulated as a mercenary and develops a small fortune. To distance himself from his mercenary past he creates the identity of millionaire entrepreneur '''Steven Grant''', using this identity to purchase a spacious estate. To remain in contact with the street and criminal element he also creates the identity of [[taxicab]] driver '''Jake Lockley'''. As Lockley, he has acquired civilian allies such as [[Bertrand Crawley]] and Gena Landers and her sons.

In the character's first appearance, the criminal organization the [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] supplies Marc Spector with the name Moon Knight, his costume and weapons (using silver) to hunt down [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russell]]. In Los Angeles, Moon Knight captures the Werewolf for the Committee, but then frees him and halts the Committee's plans, fighting Russell again.<ref>''Werewolf by Night'' #32–33</ref>  He battles [[Conquer Lord]],<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #28–29</ref> teams up with [[Spider-Man]] to fight [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]],<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' (1976) #23</ref> and fights Lupinas{{issue|date=January 2011}} and Randall, the Hatchet-Man.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk!'' #17–18</ref>

His origin of being "created by The Committee" is explained as a ruse set up by Frenchie so Marc can shut the Committee down.<ref>''Moon Knight'' <!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> #1–4</ref> He then encounters the [[Midnight Man (comics)|Midnight Man]]<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #3</ref> and returns to Chicago to prevent the poisoning of its water supply by a group called the Werewolves,<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #7–8</ref> encounters [[Morpheus (Marvel Comics)|Morpheus]]<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #12</ref> and teams with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] to fight the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)#Jonathan Powers|Jester]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #13</ref> It is around this time that he first encounters Stained Glass Scarlet.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #14</ref> Later, he battled the Werewolf once again,<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #29–30</ref> battled Bora, and met the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #35</ref> and [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 1 #36</ref>

===Fist of Khonshu===
Spector abandons his Moon Knight, Grant, and Lockley identities after the effects of Russell's bite (lunar cycle-based strength)<ref>''Moon Knight'' volume 2</ref> fade away, and functions as an independently wealthy man opening art galleries around the world, with the help of art historian Spence. Spector's estranged relationship with Marlene ends when she finally leaves him for her ex-husband when he becomes Moon Knight again.

The cult of Khonshu [[telepathy|telepathically]] summons Spector to Egypt and supplies him with a new arsenal of [[moon]]-themed projectile weaponry, originally designed by a time-traveling [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in ancient Egypt. Khonshu himself appears to Spector and enters his body, giving him the same lunar abilities he previously had.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

As the agent of Khonshu, he aids the [[West Coast Avengers]], but at the cost of alienating Frenchie and further distancing Marlene.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #21</ref> He time travels to 2940 BC to rescue the Avengers, where he learns of his weapons' design by Hawkeye.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #23</ref> He officially joins the West Coast Avengers<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #24</ref> and enters a relationship with [[Tigra]] for the remainder of his tenure on the team.

While investigating the [[Phantom Rider]] with [[Daimon Hellstrom]], Moon Knight and the Avengers are attacked by soldiers working for Khonshu's rival, [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], who is invading [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Khonshu abandons Moon Knight to battle Seth after explaining it was his wish to join the team, not Spector's. Moon Knight resigns from the team,<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #41, February 1989</ref> and reunites with Marlene and Frenchie,{{issue|date=August 2013}} only to die and be resurrected by Khonshu once more.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

===Marc Spector: Moon Knight===
[[File:Marc Spector 39.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #39<br/>Art by Gary Kwapisz.]]
After "Fist of Khonshu", a third ''Moon Knight'' volume was published. It was the longest-running series, lasting sixty issues.

This volume introduces Moon Knight's teenage sidekick Jeff Wilde, also known as "[[Midnight (Jeff Wilde)|Midnight]]", the son of [[Midnight Man (comics)|Midnight Man]], a villain from the first volume of the series. At this time, Moon Knight first encounters the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #4–5</ref> Turned into a cyborg by the [[Secret Empire]], Midnight is seemingly killed in the "Round Robin" story arc of ''Amazing Spider-Man'', spanning issues #353-#358. Midnight later reappears in ''Moon Knight'' volume 4, where Moon Knight apparently finishes him off for good.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol.4 #12</ref>

Teaming up with the [[Punisher]], Moon Knight defeated [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]],<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #8–9</ref> and during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]", fought [[Killer Shrike]], [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], and the second [[Ringer (comics)#Keith Kraft|Ringer]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> He then encountered [[Silver Sable]] and her allies [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #15</ref> As Marc Spector, he was tried for murder in Bosqueverde, South America.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #18</ref> And teamed up with the Punisher again, as well as [[Spider-Man]] against the [[Secret Empire]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #19–21</ref>

While fighting with his brother Randal Spector over who is destined to carry the mantle of Moon Knight, Marc discovers Khonshu is not the god of vengeance but the god of justice.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #37</ref>

Starting with issue #38, Moon Knight appears in [[adamantium]] armor rather than his Kevlar costume. In the comic storyline it is explained that Moon Knight needs the armor to hold his body together after being infected by the then-possessed [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]. The disease is revealed to be the villain known as [[Demogoblin]] trying to possess him. With the help of [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Mister Fantastic]], the Demogoblin parasite is removed. In issue #50, Moon Knight seemingly severs his ties to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by burning his membership ID card after being brought in by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to answer charges in regard to his illegal actions against [[Doctor Doom]]. By the end of the series, Moon Knight is killed violently, sacrificing himself to save his loved ones from a computerized villain called Seth and his "Zero Hour" program.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #60</ref>

===Resurrection War===
In 1998, writer [[Doug Moench]], artist [[Tommy Edwards]], and inker Robert Campanella brought the deceased hero back in a four-part miniseries. In 1999, Moench and artist [[Mark Texeira]] worked together on another four-part series called "High Strangeness" which was nominated for the [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Fan award for Favorite Limited Series. The title of the story was mistakenly given as "High Strangers" on the covers of the limited series. The correct title of the story, "High Strangeness", appeared on the title page of each issue.

===Minor appearances===
In 1998 Spector uses his [[Egyptian soul|Ka]] to help a critically injured [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] through the Kingdom of the Dead.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Christopher Priest (comics)|Priest, Christopher]]|penciller=[[Sal Velluto|Velluto, Sal]]|inker=[[Bob Almond|Almond, Bob]]|story=Nightmare|title=[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]|volume=3|issue=2|date=September 2000|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> In 2001 and 2002 Moon Knight joins the "Marvel Knights" non-team. After making a brief appearance in the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" story-arc, he makes a minor return in the 2005 ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' miniseries, fighting alongside [[Spider-Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and the Punisher. He later appears in issue #2 of the ''[[Great Lakes Avengers]]'' mini-series where [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] offered to recruit him in the GLA, but he immediately rejects the offer.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #2</ref>

===Moon Knight (2006)===
The first arc of the 2006 re-launch by writer [[Charlie Huston]] and penciller [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]], titled "The Bottom", explores Marc Spector's return to crime-fighting following his self-imposed exile. His retirement comes after a brutal battle with [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]]. Although his body is broken after a tremendous fall, Moon Knight finally defeats [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]] by carving off his face with a crescent moon dart. The series highlights Spector's supposed spiritual connection to the moon god as well as his own psychologically damaged state of mind. After returning to his role as Moon Knight, Spector continually receives guidance by what he believes to be Khonshu in the form of a faceless Bushman. This storyline also updates Marc Spector's timeline, suggesting he fought in the Gulf War and that his time as a mercenary was during the 1990s. It is also revealed that Frenchie is in love with Marc Spector; he indicates this is why he stuck around for so long.

In the second issue, Huston introduces the [[Profile (comics)|Profile]], an amoral character analyst whom the Committee brings in to help them entrap Moon Knight. He escapes after the plan collapses, and later becomes a reluctant source of information for Spector himself.

The next arc, "Midnight Sun", takes place during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] and follows Moon Knight as he investigates a string of murders perpetrated by Midnight, his former sidekick. This arc also depicts Moon Knight's first contact with other Marvel heroes since his return. [[Spider-Man]] attempts to contact Moon Knight but is rebuked.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #7</ref> [[Captain America]] pays him a visit to deliver a warning and they quarrel.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #8</ref> The [[Punisher]] and Moon Knight have a lengthy conversation about the nature of their vigilantism and their shared past.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #10</ref> Moon Knight is forced into a final confrontation with his former sidekick Jeff Wilde (a.k.a. Midnight), seemingly killing him for good.

[[Iron Man]] also investigates Moon Knight's activities by placing him under close surveillance. Finding his mental condition unstable, Iron Man decides that arresting Moon Knight under the Registration Act might make his mental instability worse. However, Moon Knight is identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes appearing on the cover of ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Dan Slott|Slott, Dan]]|artist=[[Stefano Caselli|Caselli, Stefano]]|story=Happy Accidents|title=[[Avengers: The Initiative]]|volume=1|issue=1|date=June 2007|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Moon Knight begrudgingly applies for registration after much prodding from Khonshu, not wanting the law to keep him from his work. The law requires him to submit to a psychiatric exam. The psychiatrist controlling the exam, along with the government and [[Tony Stark]], has no intention of granting Marc Spector approval for registration. After speaking with Spector's repressed alter egos Jake Lockley and Steven Grant, the psychiatrist begins the process of officially turning him down, suggesting possible future imprisonment. Spector breaks the doctor's will by speaking in the voice of Khonshu and pointing out the doctor's own [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] tendencies, told to him by the Profile. The psychiatrist not only approves his application, but bows to worship him as well. However, later on, Marc meets the Profile with their dialogue suggesting that the personalities above were just an act to be approved for registration.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #13</ref>

In the subsequent arc, "God and Country", writer [[Mike Benson (screenwriter)|Mike Benson]] and artist [[Mark Texeira]] take over the series, with [[Charlie Huston]] still co-plotting. This arc centers itself on Moon Knight's ability (or lack thereof) as a "registered hero" and Marc Spector's ability (or lack thereof) to hold on to the people around him. This arc sees the return of the classic Moon Knight villain [[Black Spectre#Black Spectre (Carson Knowles)|Black Spectre]]. In this story, Carson Knowles, recently released from prison, falls back into his ways as the Black Spectre and yet again attempts to destroy Moon Knight and hurt the city. In issue #19, the finale of "God and Country", Moon Knight pushes Knowles off a building apparently to his death. This arc also features a large role for [[Tony Stark]], as the head of the Initiative, and lead dissenter of Moon Knight's vigilantism.

In issue #21, a new story arc began, titled "The Death of Marc Spector". This arc is written by Mike Benson, and it involves the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], led by [[Norman Osborn]], who are now on the hunt for Moon Knight. Tony Stark and his second-in-command [[Maria Hill]] argue with former Avengers government liaison Raymond Sikorsky, now a representative of the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities|CSA]], who desperately wants for Moon Knight to be apprehended with extreme prejudice. Marc Spector himself busts up a drug deal while wearing an entirely black costume, while going through an internal monologue about how crime-fighting is much easier without the burden of his reputation and 'costume recognition'.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #22</ref>

Several weeks later, after barely surviving an altercation with the Thunderbolts, Spector pleads for Khonshu's forgiveness for turning his back on him and for the god's renewed assistance. Khonshu appears and informs Spector he doesn't need him anymore, as he now has other worshippers. Spector returns to his Moon Knight costume to aid Frenchie DuChamp in gaining revenge on the [[Whyos]] gang for attacking his restaurant and injuring Frenchie's lover Rob, only to find the Whyos' attack was designed to draw Spector into another conflict with the Thunderbolts when he is ambushed by [[Mac Gargan|Venom]].<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol.4 #23</ref> After a brief fight Moon Knight is captured, but escapes when S.H.I.E.L.D. shows up. Frenchie agrees to help Spector, and Ray joins the reformed team as well. [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] is released to kill Moon Knight, as Spector prepares to go out with a bang.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol.4 #24</ref>

Moon Knight is next seen battling Bullseye in the streets of NYC. He eventually leads Bullseye to a bunker/warehouse where he has planted several explosives. Bullseye narrowly escapes as Moon Knight ignites the explosives. Later that day two press conferences are held: one by Norman Osborn to announce the Thunderbolts' success and Moon Knight's death and the other held by Tony Stark who denounces the methods used by the Thunderbolts. At the end of the issue it is revealed that Moon Knight has faked his death, escapes from the warehouse through a secret passage in the floor, and is hiding in Mexico. It is also revealed that the Marc Spector persona has "died" and that Jake Lockley is now in control.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol.4 #25</ref>

===Vengeance of the Moon Knight===
Moon Knight returns to New York after faking his death with Jake Lockley as his dominant personality, but still struggles against his violent nature and is hounded by Khonshu in the form of a small imaginary tormentor resembling a man in the Moon Knight costume with a bird skull who goads him to kill. While trying to walk the path of a hero he makes a bold return taking on many criminals but killing none of them; now the people of New York begin to see him as a hero and not a murderous vigilante much to Norman Osborn's disdain. Jake's personality has been one of struggle against the inner demon trying to get him to kill while juggling sobriety.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #1</ref>

Later, the Sentry takes Moon Knight across the city while he saves people and stops crimes telling Lockley that eventually he will be tested and that he will fail, to which Moon Knight replies "So will you". They stare each other down for a moment before Moon Knight eventually leaves.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #2</ref>

After sending the Sentry to confront Moon Knight,<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #1-2</ref> Norman Osborn summons The Hood and The Profile to take down Moon Knight. The hood uses his powers to bring Moon Knight's longtime foe Bushman back to life. Bushman resumes to gather an army by enlisting Scarecrow to break into Ravencroft Asylum, where they lobotomize the prisoners to make them more compliant.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #4</ref>

Jake Lockley tries to make amends to Marlene and Frenchie for his previous behavior and mental breakdown. Under the Jake Lockley persona, he is regarded as more sane; Marlene mentions that his "eyes are clear". Bushman's army and the Scarecrow soon attacks New York and Moon Knight defeats them. Bushman himself manages to escape, only to later be confronted and subdued by Moon Knight. A growing Khonshu screams for vengeance, yet Moon Knight manages to defy him and spare Bushman's life. At the conclusion, Bushman winds up in jail and Jake Lockley begins to start a new life with Marlene.<ref>''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #6</ref>

===Secret Avengers===
Moon Knight became a featured member of ''[[Secret Avengers]]'', beginning in May 2010. The series was originally written by [[Ed Brubaker]] with art by [[Mike Deodato]] and features [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], [[War Machine]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]], as well as the redemption thirsty Moon Knight.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25817</ref> He remained with the Secret Avengers until the line-up was reshuffled by Hawkeye.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' (vol. 1) #22</ref>

===Shadowland===
During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Moon Knight ends up fighting Profile who was sent by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #1</ref> During Moon Knight's fight with Profile, it is revealed that the second Avatar of Khonshu who is working with Profile is none other than Moon Knight's brother Randall Spector in the alias of Shadow Knight.<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #2</ref> While Moon Knight is able to best him, it was at the cost of gaining his Marc Spector personality back.<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #3</ref>

===Moon Knight Goes to L.A. (2011-2012)===
In this series, Spector is shown in [[Los Angeles]] as the creator of a TV show based on his origin and superheroics dubbed "Legends of the Khonshu". Later on as Moon Knight, he intercepts a delivery of an [[Ultron]] robot body. Spector has also developed three new multiple personalities based on [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and the original [[Captain America]] who help guide him.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #1 (2011)</ref> Moon Knight gets the head of the Ultron, and attacks a strip club as Spider-Man to get to the mysterious L.A. Kingpin. Moon Knight beats the club leader [[Snapdragon (comics)|Snapdragon]], but gets shot by a guard before getting answers. It was the superhero [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]] who saved him, but she lost her cover in the process.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #2 (2011)</ref> Moon Knight and Echo then decide to team up against the Kingpin.<ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-3">''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #3 (2011)</ref> Meanwhile it is also revealed that Spector hired ex-SHIELD agent Buck Lime to design his weapons while posing as a soldier of fortune consultant for his TV show.<ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-3" /> After a fight with the Night Shift (sent by Snapdragon), Moon Knight and Echo formally team up against the Kingpin. Buck, however, informs the Avengers of Ultron's head, and they visit Spector who convinces them (and later Buck) that he knows what he is doing.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #6 (2011)</ref><ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-7">''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #7 (2012)</ref> Together with Buck and Echo, Moon Knight beats the Kingpin who turns out to be Count Nefaria, and captures Snapdragon (although Nefaria got away).<ref name="moon-knight-vol-4-num-7" /> But Moon Knight and Echo keep targeting and attacking Nefaria's bases of operations.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #8 (2012)</ref> Soon, however, Nefaria strikes back, and Echo is killed. This sends Moon Knight's Wolverine personality into berserker mode and it seemingly kills the Captain America and Spider-Man personalities.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #9 (2012)</ref> Moon Knight proceeds to violently attack Nefaria who gets beaten up badly. Nefaria, however, survives and sends his daughter, Madame Masque to retrieve the Ultron head, who succeeds.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #10 (2012)</ref> But Moon Knight and Buck retaliate and attack her. Madame Masque is about to beat Moon Knight, but just then he develops an Echo personality, who tells him to not let her die in vain. Moon Knight fights back, and defeats Madame Masque.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #11 (2012)</ref> Meanwhile the police have Snapdragon testify against Nefaria, and get a warrant for his arrest. Nefaria angrily attacks the police station, and is about to kill Snapdragon, but Moon Knight intervenes again. In the ensuing battle, Moon Knight is beaten, and Nefaria orders him to return the Ultron head, and work for him. Moon Knight tells Nefaria that the head is outside, but the tables were turned as Moon Knight had called the Avengers, and Nefaria was defeated. The next day, Tony Stark commends Marc Spector for a job well done, and tells that Ultron is waiting and planning a robot holocaust. After Stark leaves, it seems that Spector developed an Iron Man personality as well. In the epilogue to the series, Spector leaves Hollywood.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol 4 #12 (2012)</ref>

=== Avengers vs. X-Men ===
During the events of ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'', Moon Knight is partnered with [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[She-Hulk]] as part of a small team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] assigned to watch over the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' (vol. 1) #266</ref> During the ensuing skirmish initiated by [[Frenzy (comics)|Frenzy]], Moon Knight is rendered comatose by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' (vol. 1) #267</ref> He is last seen at [[Stark Tower]] as one of the many former Avengers celebrating the return of [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]].<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #34</ref>

=== All New Marvel NOW! ===
A new ''Moon Knight'' series was launched in 2014, written by [[Warren Ellis]] and drawn by [[Declan Shalvey]] with colors by [[Jordie Bellaire]].<ref>http://comicsalliance.com/warren-ellis-moon-knight-declan-shalvey-jordie-bellaire-all-new-marvel-now/</ref> Spector, having returned to New York, now utilizes two costumed personas. The first is Moon Knight, using a plethora of high-tech equipment such as a voice-controlled glider/drone,<ref>''Moon Knight'' (2014) #2</ref> alongside magical trinkets such as an enchanted skull helmet and other shamanic dressings.<ref>''Moon Knight'' (2014) #3</ref> As Moon Knight, Spector deals with familiar territory, often delving into the supernatural. The second persona is Mr. Knight, dressed in an all-white business suit, gloves and mask, who consults with the New York Police Department and deals with common thugs and crimes such as kidnapping.<ref>''Moon Knight'' (2014) #1, 5</ref>

It was announced in December 2014 that [[Cullen Bunn]] would take over as writer of the series with issue #13, with Ron Ackins on art duties.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=57737</ref>

==Character analysis==
[[Charlie Huston]], writer of the 2006 re-launch of ''Moon Knight'', attempted to answer the criticism that Moon Knight is an [[ersatz]] [[Batman]] in an interview with Comixfan.<ref>[http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=35259 "Charlie Huston: Shining Light on Moon Knight"], ''Comixfan'', August 17, 2005</ref> The interviewer noted that the comparison is not baseless, as both Moon Knight and the Dark Knight are wealthy, "normal" humans that use gadgetry to fight crime.

Huston accepted that the two characters had their similarities, but went on to contrast the two by noting in particular differences in origin, motives, and personality. "[[Bruce Wayne]]", he said, "fights crime to avenge the murders of his parents", whereas Moon Knight "beats up whoever has it coming because he believes he is the avatar of the Egyptian god of vengeance and it helps him to feel better about all the people he killed when he was a mercenary." Thus, while Batman is motivated by vengeance for wrong done to his parents, Marc Spector is motivated by vengeance as a concept. Huston further notes that Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, takes on other personalities merely to aid in his fight. However, Moon Knight has three alter egos which aid him as much in dealing with personal demons as fighting law-breakers, and which have taken a further psychological toll of causing [[dissociative identity disorder]]. In the question of his sanity, [[Spider-Man]] remarked "Moony. Rhymes with looney."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Powers and abilities==
Over the course of his life as a boxer, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]], [[mercenary]], and costumed superhero, Marc Spector has become an expert at hand-to-hand combat techniques and various martial arts. He is an Olympic-level athlete and a skilled acrobat and gymnast, and excels as a combat strategist. He employs a variety of weapons over the course of his career, including throwing darts, nunchaku, and a [[Club (weapon)|truncheon]]. He is skilled with most weapons, and an expert with throwing weapons. Spector is a superb driver and can pilot a helicopter.

[[Taskmaster]], who has the ability to copy and replicate anyone's fighting style, has stated that he prefers not to copy Moon Knight's style, as Moon Knight would rather take a punch than block it.

[[File:Moon Knight descending.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Promotional art of Moon Knight descending from the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]]. Art by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].]]
Spector gained his superhuman powers as a result of a visitation by the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. Moon Knight's strength, endurance, and reflexes are enhanced depending upon the phases of the moon.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #28</ref> The fuller the moon, the more strength Moon Knight derives from it, though even during a new moon, he can lift several hundred pounds. He has some degree of superhuman strength during the peak of a lunar cycle, but he only gets superhuman strength from the lunar cycle.  It's not known how much of this strength is mystical and how much is simply the result of self-hypnosis due to his psychological instability. Due to his multiple personalities, he is also resistant to some psychic attacks and sometimes receives prophetic visions.

At one point, Moon Knight is given special weapons by the cult of Khonshu made by Hawkeye, including [[bolas]], golden throwing crescent-darts shaped like [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]]s, an ivory boomerang, throwing irons, and a golden stick in the shape of an [[ankh]] that glowed in the presence of danger that can be used as a throwing weapon or bludgeon. These items are replaced with duplicate weapons crafted by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. He later retires these items to his personal museum after abandoning the "Egyptian" motif in favor of updated versions of his original styled-gear, including a truncheon/staff/nunchucks combo, and a compound bow. He has also used an axe-shaped lasso-grapple.

During the third series, Moon Knight's silver-white costume includes [[adamantium]], and he acquires an array of high-tech weaponry including an adamantium staff, a truncheon capable of firing a cable line, and gauntlets that fire crescent darts. He has also been depicted using spiked knuckles, worn on the left hand.

Later on, Moon Knight's costume uses [[Adamantium#Carbonadium|carbonadium]] as armor, and has joint-locking functions, allowing him to support weights far greater than what he can normally lift.<ref name="Vengeance5">''Vengeance of the Moon Knight'' #5</ref> Moon Knight makes use of this at one point to leave his costume supporting a building while defending himself in his underwear. Additionally, Moon Knight can 'suit up' by use of a remote control device which assembles the individual pieces of his armor onto his body, similar in fashion to [[Iron Man]].<ref name="Vengeance5"/>

For transportation, Moon Knight employs a variety of sophisticated aircraft. These include the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]] and Angelwing, featuring VTOL (vertical take-off and landing), a rope ladder, and 20&nbsp;mm cannons. Later, Moon Knight utilizes a remote controlled white limousine when acting as "Mr. Knight", and a similarly remote controlled crescent-shaped drone/glider when acting as Moon Knight.<ref>''Moon Knight'' (2014) #1-2</ref>

==Rogues gallery==
While Moon Knight fights villains such as [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[Taskmaster]] which are enemies of other heroes as well, he has also accumulated his own rogues gallery. Villains include:
* [[Black Spectre]]
* [[Bluebeard (comics)|Bluebeard]]
* [[Bora (comics)|Bora]]
* [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]]
* [[Committee (comics)|Committee]]
* [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]
* [[Killer Shrike]]
* [[Midnight Man (comics)|Midnight Man]]
* [[Morpheus (Marvel Comics)|Morpheus]]
* [[Profile (comics)|The Profile]]
* [[Shadow Knight (comics)|Shadow Knight]]
* [[Stained Glass Scarlet]]
* [[Werewolf by Night|The Werewolf]]

==Reception==
Moon Knight was ranked by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine as the 149th greatest comic book character of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 | title=Wizard's top 200 characters.

==Other versions==

===2099===
The [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''2099: Manifest Destiny'' (March 1998) introduced a female [[Marvel 2099]] version of Moon Knight, fighting crime in the lunar city of [[Attilan]]. ''Manifest Destiny'' was the last comic published in Marvel's 2099 line and the character has not reappeared since. Her identity, abilities, and motivations were never revealed.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===House Of M===
Moon Knight appears in ''[[House of M]]'' as part of [[Luke Cage]]'s Sapien Resistance against Earth's rulers, the House of Magnus ([[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his children, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and the [[Scarlet Witch]]), although he is not wearing his costume in this timeline.<ref>''House of M'' #4, 6-7</ref> He also appears in House of M: Avengers wearing his costume. A little more of his back story is uncovered as well, still following Khonshu and still suffering from multiple personalities.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #1-5</ref>

===Infinity War===
In the [[Infinity War]] crossover, the alien double of Moon Knight had ambitions. Using a source of cosmic power (the child [[Franklin Richards]]), he became the multi-dimensional Moon Shade. He then murdered the majority of the Multiverse's alternate versions of Moon Knight.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #42</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Moon Knight is one of the superheroes infected by the zombie plague. Previously he had been part of the resistance organized by [[Nick Fury]], but presumably turned into one of the zombies in a later battle.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days #1'' #1</ref> He is attacked by 'Deadites', reanimated versions of many of the dead humans, which seemingly tear Moon Knight apart.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' #5</ref> (he presumably escapes, as he is seen in the first issue of the regular [[Marvel Zombies]] series, which is set after ''Army of Darkness'') He is later killed by Deadpool, who appears on the Marvel Zombies Earth and cuts his head off.<ref>''Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth'' #8</ref>

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
In April 2010 ''S.H.I.E.L.D. #1'' features an Egyptian version of Moon Knight. This version is similar in appearance to the Khonshu statue that Marc Spector worshiped in the past. He can be seen holding a staff that has a crescent moon at the top.<ref>''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol. 1 #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Usmmoonknight.jpg|thumb|right|Ultimate Moon Knight on the partial cover to ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #80. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]] -->

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Moon Knight is a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S Marine]] that is the product of a Super Soldier experiment gone wrong. Prior to becoming Moon Knight, he worked for the [[Roxxon|Roxxon Corporation]] as [[Paladin (comics)#Ultimate Paladin|Paladin]]. It is also noted that he has a form of [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Within the comic, the "personalities" of Steven Grant, Marc Spector, Moon Knight, an unnamed red-headed little girl, and [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Ronin|Ronin]] interact through internal monologue. He lives with his girlfriend Marlene. She displays knowledge of his Moon Knight identity.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Ultimate Moon Knight first appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #79 during the ''Warriors'' story-arc. He is an active participant of a gang war waged by the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin]] and newcomer [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Hammerhead|Hammerhead]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

During the battle, he is impaled by the assassin [[Elektra (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Elektra]]. Although gravely wounded, Moon Knight subdues Elektra with a moon-blade to her head before slipping into a coma. Upon waking up, Moon Knight escapes from custody and engages in a fight with the [[Punisher#Ultimate Punisher|Punisher]], [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], and [[Ultimate Daredevil#Ultimate Daredevil|Daredevil]]. After the battle, Daredevil invites Moon Knight to join an organization of superheroes with the goal of bringing down the Kingpin.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

As part of this group, Spector adopts the identity of Ronin to infiltrate the Kingpin's ranks. The idea of turning 'Ronin' into the main persona is made by the Steven Grant and Marc Spector personalities, who oppose the Moon Knight persona and the concerns of the small girl persona. In doing so, they create a far more ruthless personality who the Kingpin would find suitable. Moon Knight himself is angered by this decision, but is seemingly destroyed by the Ronin personality.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The Kingpin discovers that Ronin is working for Daredevil and orders his execution. He survives, however, and after regaining consciousness goes to the police claiming that the Kingpin ordered his execution. This provides a charge for the police to arrest the Kingpin, but he has to reveal his secret identity for a charge to be placed. It also seems that the Moon Knight persona is still alive after the Ronin persona decides to wake him up.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Universe X===
In [[Universe X]], Moon Knight is locked in a never ending battle with the Sons of Set, over the statue of Khonshu. It's actually stated that Marc Spector has been dead from the beginning, and just as the moon reflects light, Spector has been "reflecting" the form of a living man, making him effectively immortal.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Moreover, it is also suggested that the original inspiration for the moon god Khonshu was the Watcher [[Uatu]] who watches the Earth from his base on the moon.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

* Moon Knight is one of the default playable characters on the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|next-gen]] consoles ([[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]) versions of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. He can wear his Classic, Ultimate, and Khonshu costumes. A [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] available for the PC, PS2, PSP, and Xbox version of the game unlocks him as a playable character, adding a fourth costume which is labeled as 'Modern' which closely resembles his action figure costume with the arm and leg gauntlets, previously black body suit 'Retro'.<ref name="MUA1">{{cite book |title=Marvel Ultimate Alliance: Signature Series Guide |first=Thom |last=Denick |publisher=Brady Games |location=Indianapolis, Indiana| isbn=0-7440-0844-1 |year=2006 |pages=54, 53}}</ref>
* Moon Knight appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. Spider-Man first encounters him in his Mooncopter at the top of Spector Tower when Black Cat makes her escape and Spider-Man defeats Kingpin's forces. He and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] later argues about the idea of Spider-Man busting [[Tinkerer]] out of [[Ryker's Island]] when it came to the symbiotes' invasion, yet still gives Spider-Man a ride to the facility if he chooses the Red Suit path. He later helps S.H.I.E.L.D. in fighting the symbiotic invasion. After the defeat of Symbiote-Vulture, Moon Knight flies Spider-Man to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier that Venom and his symbiotes are attacking if the player has a Red Suit path. Artwork shown on the end credits of the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii versions depict a Symbiote-Moon Knight, but this concept was not used in the actual game.

===Collectibles===

====Action figures====
Moon Knight has had five figure renditions over the years (six including a variant in the most recent figure). The first figure was an exclusive mail-away figure in the "Marvel Gold" Line. It was a simple figure based on a ToyBiz base sculpt, with a thin latex-like cape and belt (reminiscent of the costume style employed by artist Stephen Platt). The figure was painted white, with a black head. Moon Knight's second figure was from the 10" Marvel Universe Line. This figure was a repaint of a base sculpt (used for Spider-Man, Daredevil, and many others) and included a cloth cape. The figure was painted white, had yellow arm bands, and a black head. More recently Moon Knight has been included in the [[Marvel Select]] line from Diamond Select Toys. This version of the figure comes with a rubber cape and rubber crescent dart accessories, as well as a Khonshu Statue. The figure is painted a Greyish color, with a black head, white arm bands and boots. Moon Knight has also appeared in a recent series of the [[Marvel Legends]] line. This figure is painted black, with white gloves, boots, and cape. It comes with both a [[nunchaku]] and staff accessory, and its cape is made of rubber as well. It also has a printed cardboard background. This figure also had a rare variant version. The variant was identical in that the costume was shiny silver instead of black. Most recently, Moon Knight has been released in the 3{{fraction|3|4}}" Marvel Universe line. In this line, Moon Knight is white with a black face, and comes with a rubber cape, a crescent shaped throwing dart and staff.

In addition to these more traditional action figures, Moon Knight has been included in the [[Super Hero Squad]] toy line from [[Hasbro]] as part of a two-pack with [[Spider-Man]]. A Moon Knight figure was also released in series 29 of the Marvel Minimates figures, as part of a two-pack with Armored Daredevil.

===Statues===
Numerous commercially released statues have been created of the character Moon Knight. The first was a mini bust created by Bowen Designs in the late 1990s. It features a him in his white costume from the waist up. The second rendition was another mini bust from Diamond Select in 2006. It depicted only his torso and head, and featured a darker costume and white cape. In 2006 Bowen Designs released a full body statue of Moon Knight sculpted and designed by the Kucharek Brothers. This statue came in two versions. The first was painted a dark silver, and the second, which was far more rare, was painted white. In 2013 Gentle Giant released yet another mini bust of Moon Knight.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/toys/18722/gentle_giant_releases_new_moon_knight_and_deadpool_corps_mini_busts</ref> This statue featured a waist up depiction of moon knight with his arms prominently displayed.
