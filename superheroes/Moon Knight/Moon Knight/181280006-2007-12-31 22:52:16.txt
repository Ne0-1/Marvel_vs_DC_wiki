'''Moon Knight''' ('''Marc Spector''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Don Perlin]], he first appeared in ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32 (August 1975).

==Publication history==
The character debuted in the title ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32 (August 1975), written by [[Doug Moench]] with art by [[Don Perlin]], as an enemy of the title character in a two part story continuing in issue #33. The character proved popular with readers, and was granted a solo spot in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #28-29 (1976), written by Doug Moench with art by Don Perlin.

He then had appearances in ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' issues #22 and #23, both written by [[Bill Mantlo]] with art by [[Mike Zeck]] on #22 and [[Jim Mooney]] on #23, ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #52, written by [[Steven Grant]] with art by [[Jim Craig]], and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #48-50. Moon Knight then gained a backup strip in the ''[[Hulk! Magazine]]'' in issues #11-15, #17-18 and #20-21, all written by Doug Moench. Art was done by [[Gene Colan]] in #11, [[Keith Pollard]] in #12, and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] on the rest. These were reprinted in ''[[Moon Knight Special Edition]]'' #1-3.

A new ongoing series was then launched, titled ''Moon Knight'', which also had writing by Doug Moench and art by Bill Sienkiewicz. During the early 1980s ''Moon Knight'' was one of the three "direct distribution only" Marvel titles, starting with issue #15. This series ended with issue #38. In 1985 there was a six-issue series called ''[[Moon Knight - Fist Of Khonshu]]''. Then in 1989 ''[[Marc Spector: Moon Knight]]''  debuted. This ended in issue #60 (March 1994), written by [[Terry Kavanagh]] with art by [[Stephen Platt]] depicting his death. In 1992 ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight Special Edition'' #1 and ''Moon Knight: Divided We Fall'' were published, followed in  January 1998 and January 1999 by two further four-issue [[limited series]]. A new ''Moon Knight'' ongoing series was launched in April 2006, written by [[Charlie Huston]] with art by [[David Finch]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
[[Image:Moon knight issue 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Moon Knight'' <!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> #1<br> Art by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]].]]
Born in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], Marc Spector is an [[United States|American]] [[rabbi]]'s wayward son. As an adult, Spector spends time as a boxer, a U.S. Marine, and a [[mercenary]]. He becomes a skilled combatant and befriends the [[France|French]] [[aviator|pilot]] Jean-Paul DuChamp, whom he calls "Frenchie." While the pair work for the African mercenary [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]] in Egypt, the group stumble upon an [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig whose crew includes Dr. Peter [[Alraune]] and his daughter [[Marlene Alraune|Marlene]]. The dig had uncovered an ancient temple where artifacts included a statue of the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] god [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]]. Intent on looting the dig, Bushman kills Dr. Alraune. In response to Alraune's murder, Spector challenges Bushman to personal combat but is beaten nearly to death and left to die in the sub-zero temperatures of the desert night.

Roaming Egyptians who worship the ancient Egyptian gods find Spector and carry him to their temple. Helpless before the statue of Khonshu, Spector's heart stops. Khonshu appears to him in a [[Vision (religion)|vision]], offering Spector a second chance at life if he becomes the god's avatar on earth. Spector awakens, wraps himself with the silver shroud that covers Khonshu's statue, and again confronts Bushman. He defeats Bushman and returns to America with Marlene Alraune, Frenchie, and the statue of Khonshu. Deciding to become a crime-fighter, Spector creates a silver cloaked costume, based on the silver shroud, and becomes the Moon Knight.

After his return to the United States, Spector invests the money that he had accumulated as a mercenary and develops a small fortune. To distance himself from his mercenary past he creates the identity of millionaire Steven Grant, using this identity to purchase a spacious estate. To remain in contact with the common man he also creates the identity of [[taxicab]] driver Jake Lockley.

In his original appearance in ''Werewolf by Night'' #32, the [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] supplies Mark Spector (as spelled in the comic) with the name Moon Knight, his costume and weapons to hunt down Jack Russell. This [[Retroactive continuity|ret-conned]] origin is explained away in ''Moon Knight'' <!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> #4 and is described as a ruse set up by Frenchie so that Marc can secretly infiltrate the Committee in an effort to shut it down.

===Fist of Khonshu===
During the six-issue ''Fist of Khonshu'' mini-series, the cult of Khonshu [[telepathy|telepathically]] summons Spector to Egypt. They give him a small arsenal of [[moon]]-themed projectile weaponry, such as throwing discs and [[crescent]]-shaped [[blade]]s, originally designed by a time-traveling [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in ancient Egypt.  Khonshu himself appears to Spector and enters his body, giving him [[superhuman]] strength which waxes and wanes with the phases of the moon. As the direct agent of Khonshu, he joins the [[West Coast Avengers]], but at the cost of alienating Marlene and Frenchie. Moon Knight strikes up a relationship with [[Tigra]] that lasts for his remaining tenure on the team.  Khonshu is eventually forcibly expelled from Spector's body by [[Daimon Hellstrom]] during a battle with the Phantom Rider. Moon Knight speaks directly to Khonshu, who explains that it is he and not Moon Knight that wanted to join the Avengers.  Upon realizing this, Moon Knight declines his active status with the team.  Reuniting with his friends, Moon Knight begins his career of adventuring anew.  Although he dies in battle, he is resurrected by the statue of Khonshu.

===Marc Spector: Moon Knight===
[[Image:Marc Spector 39.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #39<br>Art by Gary Kwapisz.]]
After "Fist of Khonshu", a third ''Moon Knight'' volume was published. It was the longest-running series, lasting sixty issues before ending.

This volume introduces Moon Knight's teenage sidekick Jeff Wilde, also known as "Midnight." Wilde is actually the son of [[Midnight Man (comics)|Midnight Man]], a villain from the first volume. Midnight makes a few appearances until issue #24. Turned into a cyborg by the [[Secret Empire]], Midnight is seemingly killed in the "Round Robin" story arc of ''Amazing Spider-Man'', spanning issues #353-#358.

In issue #37 while fighting with his brother Randal Spector over who is destined to carry the mantle of Moon Knight, Marc discovers Khonshu is not the god of vengeance but the god of justice.

Starting with issue #38, Moon Knight appears in [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] armor rather than his Kevlar costume. In the comic storyline it is explained that Moon Knight needs the armor to hold his body together after being infected by the then-possessed Hobgoblin. The disease is revealed to be the villain known as [[Demogoblin]] trying to possess him. With the help of [[Dr. Strange]] and [[Mr. Fantastic]], the Demogoblin parasite is removed. In issue #50, Moon Knight seemingly severs his ties to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by burning his membership ID card after being brought in by Thor to answer charges in regard to his illegal actions against Dr Doom. By the end of the series, Moon Knight is killed violently, sacrificing himself to save his loved ones from a computerized villain called Seth and his "Zero Hour" program.

===Resurrection War===
In 1998, writer [[Doug Moench]], artist [[Tommy Edwards]], and inker [[Robert Campanella]] brought the deceased hero back in a four-part mini series. In 1999, Moench and artist [[Mark Texeira]] worked together on another four-part series called "High Strangeness" which was nominated for the [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Fan award for Favorite Limited Series. (The title of the story was mistakenly given as "High Strangers" on the covers of the limited series.  The correct title of the story, "High Strangeness," appeared on the title page of each issue.)

===Minor appearances===
In 2001 and 2002 Moon Knight joins the "Marvel Knights" non-team. After making a brief appearance in the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" story-arc, he makes a minor return in the 2005 ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' miniseries, fighting alongside [[Spider-Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]].

===Moon Knight, volume 4===
The first arc of the 2006 re-launch by writer [[Charlie Huston]] and penciller [[David Finch]], titled "The Bottom," explores Marc Spector's return to crime-fighting following his self-imposed exile. His retirement comes after a brutal battle with [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]]. Although his body is broken after a tremendous fall, Moon Knight finally defeats Bushman by carving off his face with a crescent moon dart. The series highlights Spector's supposed spiritual connection to the moon god as well as his own psychologically damaged state of mind. After returning to his role as Moon Knight, Spector continually receives guidance by what he believes to be Khonshu in the form of a faceless Bushman. This storyline also updates Marc Spector's timeline, suggesting he fought in the Gulf War and that his time as a mercenary was during the 1990s.  

In the second issue, Huston introduces [[the Profile]], an amoral character analyst whom the Committee brings in to help them entrap Moon Knight.  He escapes after the plan collapses, and later becomes a reluctant source of information for Spector himself.

The next arc, "Midnight Sun," follows Moon Knight as he investigates a string of murders perpetrated by Midnight, his former sidekick. This arc also depicts Moon Knight's first contact with other Marvel heroes since his return, thus making those issues part of "Casualties of War." [[Spider-Man]] attempts to contact Moon Knight but is rebuked.<ref>''Moon Knight'', volume 4, #7</ref> [[Captain America]] pays him a visit to deliver a warning and in return the two quarrel.<ref>''Moon Knight'', volume 4, #8</ref> The [[Punisher]] and Moon Knight have a lengthy conversation both about the nature of their vigilantism and their shared past.<ref>''Moon Knight'', volume 4, #10</ref>

===Civil War/The Initiative===
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], [[Captain America]] visits Spector, advising him to stay out of the conflict because of Spector's past as a brutal vigilante.  Spector reacts to Captain America's visit by calling the entire war a game of "capture the flag".

[[Iron Man]] also investigates Moon Knight's activities by placing him under close surveillance. Finding his mental condition unstable, Iron Man decides that arresting Moon Knight under the Registration Act might make his mental instability worse.

Moon Knight is identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes appearing on the cover of ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>
                               
Moon Knight begrudgingly applies for registration after much prodding from Khonshu, not wanting the law to keep him from his work.  The law requires him to submit to a psychiatric exam.  The psychiatrist controlling the exam, along with the government and [[Tony Stark]], have no intention of granting Marc Spector approval for registration.  After speaking with Spector's repressed alter egos Jake Lockley and Steven Grant, the psychiatrist begins the process of officially turning him down, suggesting possible future imprisonment.  Spector breaks the doctor's will by speaking in the voice of [[Khonshu]] and pointing out the doctor's own [[antisocial]] tendencies, told to him by [[the Profile]].  The psychiatrist not only approves his application, but bows to worship him as well.  However, later on, Marc meets The Profile with their dialogue suggesting that the personalities above were just an act to be approved for registration.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #13</ref>

==Character analysis==
Moon Knight is often criticized as an [[ersatz]] [[Batman]] and the parallels are indeed apparent. Writer of the 2006 re-launch of ''Moon Knight'', [[Charlie Huston]] attempted to answer these criticisms in an interview with Comixfan[http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=35259]. The interviewer noted that the comparison is not baseless, as both Moon Knight and the Dark Knight are wealthy, "normal" humans that use gadgetry to fight crime. Though not specifically mentioned by the interviewer, further comparisons may be drawn due to the two characters' specialized vehicles, use of themes in their gadgets, and use of fear to aid their fight against the criminal element.

Huston accepted that the two characters had their extreme similarities, but went on to contrast the two by noting in particular differences in origin, motives, and personality. "Bruce Wayne", he said, "fights crime to avenge the murders of his parents", whereas Moon Knight "beats up whoever has it coming because he believes he is the avatar of the Egyptian god of vengeance and it helps him to feel better about all the people he killed when he was a mercenary." Thus, while Batman is motivated by vengeance for wrong done to his parents, Marc Spector primarily seeks redemption from crimes he committed in his mercenary past. Huston further notes that Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, takes on other personalities merely to aid in his fight. However, Moon Knight has three alter egos which aid him as much in dealing with personal demons as fighting law-breakers, and which have taken a further psychological toll of causing [[dissociative identity disorder]].

==Powers and abilities==
Over the course of his life as a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]], boxer, [[mercenary]], [[C.I.A.]] operative and costumed superhero, Marc Spector has become one of the finest hand-to-hand combatants in the world. He is an Olympic-level athlete and excels as a combat strategist. He employs a variety of weapons over the course of his career, including throwing darts and a [[Club (weapon)|truncheon]]. He is a superb driver and can pilot a helicopter.

[[Image:Moon Knight descending.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Promotional art of Moon Knight descending from the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]]. Art by [[David Finch]].]]
Moon Knight's strength, endurance and reflexes are enhanced depending upon the phases of the moon.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #28</ref> The fuller the moon, the more strength Moon Knight derives from it. It's not known on whether the strength is mystical in nature or metaphysical as in self-hypnosis due to his psychological instability. Due to his multiple personalities, he is also resistant to some psychic attacks and sometimes receives prophetic visions.

At one point, Moon Knight is given special weapons by the cult of Khonshu, including [[bolas]], golden throwing crescent-darts shaped like [[scarab]]s, an ivory boomerang, throwing irons, and a golden club in the shape of an [[ankh]] that glowed in the presence of danger. These items are replaced with duplicate weapons crafted by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. He later retires these items to his personal museum after abandoning the "Egyptian" motif in favor of updated versions of his original styled-gear, including a truncheon/staff/nunchucks combo, and a compound bow.

During the third series, Moon Knight's silver-white costume includes [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]], and he acquires an array of high-tech weaponry including an Adamantium staff, a truncheon capable of firing a cable line, and gauntlets that fire crescent darts. He has also been depicted using spiked knuckles, worn on the left hand.

For transportation, Moon Knight employs a variety of sophisticated aircraft. These include the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]] and Angelwing, featuring VTOL (vertical take-off and landing), a rope ladder, and 20 mm cannons.

==Other versions==
===2099===
The [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''2099: Manifest Destiny'' (Mar. 1998) introduced a female [[Marvel 2099]] version of Moon Knight, fighting crime in the lunar city of [[Attilan]]. ''Manifest Destiny'' was the last comic published in Marvel's 2099 line and the character has not reappeared since. Her identity, abilities and motivations were never revealed.

===House Of M===
Moon Knight appears in ''[[House of M]]'' as part of [[Luke Cage]]'s Sapien Resistance against the House of Magnus ([[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and the [[Scarlet Witch]]), although he is not wearing his costume in this timeline.

He is also slated to reappear as one of Luke Cage's Avengers in the upcoming House of M: Avengers series.

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Moon Knight is one of the superheroes infected by the zombie plague. He is in his living form in the one shot issue, ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' as part of the resistance organized by [[Nick Fury]] but presumably turned into one of the zombies in a later battle. In issue #5 of [[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]], he is attacked by 'Deadites', reanimated versions of many of the dead humans. Wanting revenge, these Deadites seemingly tear Moon Knight apart. He presumably escapes, as he is seen in the first issue of the regular [[Marvel Zombies]] series, which is set after ''Army of Darkness''. He is later killed by the [[Silver Surfer]] in self defense, when Moon Knight attempts to attack and devour the herald among the other Marvel Zombies.

===Ultimate Moon Knight===
[[Image:Usmmoonknight.jpg|thumb|right|Ultimate Moon Knight on the partial cover to<br>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #80<br>Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

A former Navy Seal, Ultimate Moon Knight is the product of a failed Super Soldier experiment. Prior to becoming Moon Knight, he worked for the Roxxon Corporation as [[Paladin (comics)#Ultimate Universe|Paladin]]. It is also noted that he has a form of [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Within the comic, the "personalities" of Steven Grant, Marc Spector, Moon Knight, an unnamed red-headed little girl with no eyes, and Ronin interact through internal monologue.  He lives with a woman he addresses as Marlene, although it is unclear what their relationship is.  She displays knowledge of his Moon Knight identity.

Ultimate Moon Knight first appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #79 during the ''Warriors'' story-arc. He is an active participant of a gang war waged by the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin]] and newcomer [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Hammerhead|Hammerhead]].

During the battle, he is impaled by the assassin [[Elektra (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Elektra]]. Although gravely wounded, Moon Knight subdues Elektra with a moon-blade to her head before slipping into a coma. Upon waking up, Moon Knight escapes from custody and engages in a fight with the [[Punisher (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Punisher]], [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. After the battle, Daredevil invites Moon Knight to join an organization of super-heroes with the goal of bringing down the Kingpin.

As part of this group, Spector adopts the identity of [[Ronin (comics)#Ultimate Ronin|Ronin]] to infiltrate the Kingpin's ranks. The idea of turning 'Ronin' into the main persona is made by the Steven Grant and Marc Spector personalities, who oppose the Moon Knight persona and the concerns of the small girl persona. In doing so, they create a far more ruthless personality who the Kingpin would find suitable. Moon Knight himself is angered by this decision, but is seemingly destroyed by the Ronin personality.

The Kingpin discovers that Ronin is working for Daredevil and orders his execution. He survives, however, and after regaining consciousness goes to the police claiming that the Kingpin ordered his execution. This provides a charge for the police to arrest the Kingpin, but he has to reveal his secret identity for a charge to be placed. It also seems that the Moon Knight persona is still alive after the Ronin persona decides to wake him up.

===Universe X===
In [[Universe X]], Moon Knight is locked in a never ending battle with the Sons of Set, over the statue of Khonshu.

===Action figures===
Moon Knight has had four figure renditions over the years (five including a variant in the most recent figure). The first figure was an exclusive mail-away figure in the "Marvel Gold" Line. It was a simple figure based off of a ToyBiz base sculpt, with a thin latex-like cape and belt (reminiscent of the costume style employed by artist Stephen Platt). The figure was painted white, with a black head. Moon Knight's Second figure was from the 10" Marvel Universe Line. This figure was a repaint of a base sculpt (used for spider-man, daredevil, and many others) and included a cloth cape. The figure was painted white, had yellow arm bands, and a black head. More recently Moon Knight has been included in the [[Marvel Select]] line from Diamond Select Toys. This version of the figure comes with a rubber cape, rubber crescent dart accessories, as well as a Khonshu Statue. The figure is painted a Greyish color, with a black head, white arm bands and boots. Moon Knight has also appeared in a recent series of the [[Marvel Legends]] line. This figure is painted black, with white gloves, boots, and cape. It comes with both a nunchuck and staff accessory, and its cape is made of rubber as well. It also has a printed cardboard background. This figure also had a rare variant version. The variant was identical in that the costume was shiny silver instead of black.
