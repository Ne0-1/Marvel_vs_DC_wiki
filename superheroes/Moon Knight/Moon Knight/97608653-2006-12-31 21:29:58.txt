==Publication history==
[[Image:Moon_knight_issue_1.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''Moon Knight'' (1st series) #1<br> Art by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]].]]

The character debuted in the title ''[[Werewolf by Night]]'' #32 (August 1975), written by [[Doug Moench]] with art by [[Don Perlin]], as an enemy of the title character in a two part story continuing in issue #33. The character proved popular with readers, and was granted a solo spot in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #28-29 (1976), written by Doug Moench with art by` Don Perlin.

He then had appearances in ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' issues #22 and #23, both written by [[Bill Mantlo]] with art by [[Mike Zeck]] on #22 and [[Jim Mooney]] on #23, ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #52, written by [[Steven Grant]] with art by [[Jim Craig]], and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #48-50. Moon Knight then gained a backup strip in the ''[[Hulk! Magazine]]'' in issues #11-15, #17-18 and #20-21, all written by Doug Moench. Art was done by [[Gene Colan]] in #11, [[Keith Pollard]] in #12, and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] on the rest. These were reprinted in ''[[Moon Knight Special Edition]]'' #1-3.

A new ongoing series was then launched, titled ''Moon Knight'', which also had writing by Doug Moench and art by Bill Sienkiewicz. During the early 1980s ''Moon Knight'' was one of the three Marvel titles turned into direct distribution only titles, starting with issue #15. This series ended with issue #38. In 1985 there was a six-issue series called ''[[Moon Knight - Fist Of Khonshu]]''. Then in 1989 ''[[Marc Spector: Moon Knight]]'' debuted. This ended in issue #60 (March 1994), written by [[Terry Kavanagh]] with art by [[Stephen Platt]] depicting his death. In 1992 ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight Special Edition'' #1 and ''Moon Knight: Divided We Fall'' were published. In January 1998 and January 1999 two four-issue [[limited series]] were published. A new ''Moon Knight'' ongoing series was launched in April 2006, written by [[Charlie Huston]] with art by [[David Finch]].

''Moon Knight's'' most notable team was Doug Moench and Bill Sienkiewicz. Moench launched the character and had a long, productive run, defining the character with often dark adventures across many different titles. Sienkiewicz illustrated many of Moon Knight's appearances in ''Hulk! Magazine'', and also launched the character's first solo series. He enjoyed a long tenure on the comic, producing memorable covers for Moon Knight as well.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Moon Knight was originally Marc Spector, an [[United States|American]] [[rabbi]]'s wayward son who had become a [[mercenary]].  As a mercenary he became a skilled combatant, and befriended the [[France|French]] [[aviator|pilot]] Jean-Paul DuChamp, whom he came to call "Frenchie".  While the pair were working for the African mercenary [[Bushman (comics)|Raoul Bushman]] in Egypt, he stumbled upon an [[archaeology|archaeological]] dig whose crew included Dr. Peter Alraune and his daughter Marlene.  The dig had uncovered an ancient temple whose artifacts included a [[statue]] of the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] [[god]] [[Chons|Khonshu]].  Bushman stated his intent to loot the dig; this provoked Dr. Alraune to attack Bushman, a decision that cost him his life.  In response to Alraune's murder, Spector challenged Bushman to personal combat; he was beaten nearly to death and left to die in the sub-zero temperatures of the [[desert]] night.

[[Image:Moon_knight_inline.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Promotional cover for ''Moon Knight'' (4th series) #2 (2006)<br> Art by [[David Finch]] and Danny Miki.]]
Spector was found by nearby Egyptians who worshipped the ancient Egyptian gods and was carried to their temple.  His heart stopped, but he did not die.  Khonshu appeared to him in a [[Vision (religion)|vision]], offering Spector his life if he would serve the god on Earth.  Spector was returned to life in a [[haze]].  He concealed himself within the silver shroud that covered Khonshu's statue and again confronted Bushman. He defeated Bushman and returned to America with Marlene Alraune, Frenchie, and the statue of Khonshu that had seemingly empowered him.  With no further communication from Khonshu, he determined that he had [[hallucination|hallucinated]] the encounter; nevertheless, he decided to become a crimefighter.  He created a silver cloaked costume, based on the appearance of the shroud he had worn while battling Bushman, and became the Moon Knight.

On his first outing as the Moon Knight, he battled the [[werewolf]] Jack Russell, better known as the [[Werewolf by Night]]. After this encounter he laid low for a time; during this period the money that he had accumulated as a mercenary had grown into a small fortune, thanks to wise [[investment]]s on Spector's part.  To distance himself from his mercenary past he created the identity of the millionaire Steven Grant, using this identity to purchase a spacious estate; to remain in contact with the common man he also created the identity of [[taxicab]] driver Jake Lockley.  Resuming his activities as Moon Knight, he battled a number of [[criminal]]s and [[supervillain]]s of a bizarre and [[mysticism|mystical]] nature.  However, the stress of maintaining four separate identities began to take its toll on his [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].  Marlene convinced him to retire the Grant and Lockley aliases, to sell the statue of Khonshu, and to retire as Moon Knight. 

As a side note, in his first appearance in Werewolf by Night, his name was spelt "Mark", not "Marc", and it was in fact the Committee that hired him that gave him both his costume and the name 'Moon Knight', originally making his weapons and armour out of silver to better fight the werewolf. This false origin was later explained away in issue #4 of the first series of Moon Knight. In a plan devised by Moon Knight and Frenchie to bring down the Committee, Frenchie supplied the costume and equipment to the Committee to supply "Mark Spector" so that they could capture the werewolf.

===Fist of Khonshu===
However, Moon Knight's retirement was short-lived.  He was soon [[telepathy|telepathically]] summoned to Egypt by the [[cult]] of Khonshu who had saved his life.  They gave him a small arsenal of [[moon]]-themed projectile weaponry, such as throwing [[disc]]s and [[crescent]]-shaped [[blade]]s, originally designed by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] during a jaunt to ancient Egypt.  Khonshu himself then appeared to Spector and entered his body, giving him [[superhuman]] strength which waxed and waned with the phases of the moon.  As the direct agent of Khonshu he recovered the statue of Khonshu and joined the [[West Coast Avengers]] for a short time from issues #21 to #41, but at the cost of alienating Marlene and Frenchie.  Khonshu was eventually forcibly expelled from his body by [[Daimon Hellstrom]]. Moon Knight spoke directly to Khonshu, who explained that it was he and not Moon Knight that was curious about the Avengers so much so he wanted to join, upon realizing this Moon Knight saw no reason to remain.  Reuniting with his friends, Moon Knight began his career of adventuring anew.  He died in battle, only to be once again resurrected by the statue of Khonshu.

===Marc Spector: Moon Knight===
After "Fist of Khonshu", ''Moon Knight'' entered a third volume. It was the longest-running series, lasting sixty issues before ending. In the final chapter, ''Moon Knight'' is killed violently, sacrificing himself to save his loved ones from a computerized villain called Seth and his "Zero Hour" program. 

This volume also introduces Moon Knight's teenage sidekick "Midnight" aka Jeff Wilde. Wilde is actually the son of [[Midnight Man]], a villain from the first volume. Midnight makes a few appearances until ''Moon Knight'' #24, by then he has been turned into a cyborg by the Serect Empire and is eventually killed in the "Round Robin" story arc of ''Amazing Spider-Man'', spanning issues #353-#358.

In issue #37 whilst battling his brother over the mantle of Moon Knight, Marc discovers that Khonshu was the god of justice and not vengeance as he believed. Although amazed by this insight it did very little to alter his outlook on being Moon Knight. This plot twist also seems to have been discarded and forgotten about.

Starting with issue #38 Moon Knight started appearing in armour rather than his kevlar costume. The costume change was explained to fans as needed retooling to extend the life of the series, as explained in the fan mail section 'Knight Lines' in issues following the appearance of the armour. In the comic, however, it is explained that Moon Knight needs the armour to hold his body together after being infected by a disease by the then-possessed Hobgoblin. The disease is revealed to be [[Demogoblin]] trying to possess him. During the Infinity War, the parasite that infected Moon Knight's body prevented his doppelganger Moon Shade from absorbing him on his quest to becoming the only Moon Knight throughout the multiverse.

With the help of Dr Strange and Mr Fantastic, the Demogoblin parasite is removed and Moon Knight is cured. As a strange twist near the end of this storyline Marc Spector even tries to recruit Peter Parker aka Spider-Man to become the next Moon Knight.

In issue 50 Moon Knight is brought up on charges by the Avengers for his illegal actions against Dr Doom after lying to Mr Fantastic about his Avenger status in order to enlist his aid. Rather than endure a trial, Moon Knight sets fire to his Avengers card and just walks out, supposedly cutting ties with them forever.

===Resurrection War===
In 1998, writer [[Doug Moench]], artist [[Tommy Edwards]], and inker [[Robert Campanella]] brought the deceased hero back in a four-part mini series. In 1999, Moench and artist [[Mark Texeira]] worked together on another four-part series called "High strangers" which was nominated for the [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Fan award for Favorite Limited Series.

===Minor Appearances===
Moon Knight all but disappeared from the Marvel Universe for awhile. In 2001 and 2002 he was a part of the "Marvel Knights" non-team. After making a brief appearance during the [[Avengers Disassembled]] story-arc, he made a minor return in the 2005 [[Marvel Team-Up]] miniseries, fighting alongside [[Spider-Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]]. His appearance in that story was so well received by the fans that Marvel shortly afterward announced a ''Moon Knight'' miniseries, which was later decided to continue as an ongoing series before the first issue hit stores. Moon Knight was also featured in the 2099 Manifest Destiny book.

===Moon Knight, Volume 4===
The first arc, "The Bottom", of the 2006 relaunch of ''Moon Knight'', by writer [[Charlie Huston]] and penciler [[David Finch]], explores Marc Spector's return to crime-fighting following his self-imposed exile.

==Character analysis==
Moon Knight is often criticized as an [[ersatz]] [[Batman]] and the parallels are indeed apparent. Writer of the 2006 relaunch of ''Moon Knight'', [[Charlie Huston]], attempted to answer these criticisms in an interview with Comixfan[http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=35259]. The interviewer noted that the comparison is not baseless, as both Moon Knight and the Dark Knight are wealthy, "normal" humans that use gadgetry to fight crime.  Though not specifically mentioned by the interviewer, further comparisons may be drawn due to the two characters' specialized vehicles, use of themes in their gadgets, and use of fear to aid their fight against the criminal element.

Huston, though he disagreed, accepted that the character may be a rip-off of Batman, but went on to contrast the two by noting in particular differences in origin, motives, and personality. "Bruce Wayne", he said, "fights crime to avenge the murders of his parents", whereas Moon Knight "beats up whoever has it coming because he believes he is the avatar of the Egyptian god of vengeance and it helps him to feel better about all the people he killed when he was a mercenary." Thus, while Batman is motivated by vengeance for wrong done to his parents, Marc Spector primarily seeks redemption from crimes he committed in his mercenary past.  Huston further notes that Bruce Wayne, Batman's alterego, takes on other personalities merely to aid in his fight.  However, Moon Knight has three alteregos which aid him as much in dealing with personal demons as fighting law-breakers, and which have taken a further psychological toll of causing [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Moon_Knight_descending.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Promotional art of Moon Knight descending to the city streets. Art by [[David Finch]].]]
Over the course of his life as a  U.S. Marine, boxer, mercenary, C.I.A. operative and costumed superhero, Marc Spector has become one of the finest hand-to-hand combatants in the world. He is an Olympic-level athlete and excels as a combat strategist. He has employed a variety of weapons over the course of his career, including throwing darts and a truncheon similar to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil's]]. He is a superb driver and can pilot a helicopter, though he usually leaves this to Frenchie.

Although it is emphasized more in his second series, early appearances of Moon Knight depict his ability to gain enhanced strength, endurance and reflexes with the waxing and waning phases of the moon (e.g., ''Marvel Spotlight'' #28).  The fuller the moon, the more strength Moon Knight derives from it.  In an early appearance, it is theorized that Moon Knight gained this power by being injured in a fight with the [[Werewolf by Night]] (''Hulk! Magazine'' #13).  However, this has never been confirmed, and it is generally assumed that this particular ability is the result of his connection to the moon god, Khonshu.  Due to his multiple personalities he is also resistant to some psychic attacks and he also has the power of prophetic visions.

Moon Knight was given special weapons by the cult of Khonshu, including [[bolas]], golden throwing darts shaped like [[scarab]]s and a golden club in the shape of an [[ankh]] that glowed in the presence of danger. Most of these weapons were crafted by Hawkeye (see '''Fist of Khonshu''' above). 

During his third series, Moon Knight's silver-white costume was improved to include [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]], and he acquired an array of high-tech weaponry including a Adamantium staff, a truncheon which could fire a cable line, and gauntlets which could fire his crescent darts. Lately he has been using spiked knuckles, worn on the left hand. As Marc Spector he wielded various firearms, and would occasionally employ them in his Moon Knight identity as well.

For transportation, Moon Knight has employed a variety of sophisticated aircraft. These have included the Mooncopter and Angelwing; the vehicles have featured VTOL (vertical take-off and landing), a rope ladder, and 20 mm cannons. Marc Spector's Mooncar was very shortlived and its wreckage was also used as sight gag later on.

==Alternate Moon Knights==
===Ultimate Moon Knight===
[[Image:Usmmoonknight.jpg|thumb|left|Ultimate Moon Knight<br> Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
Ultimate Moon Knight first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #79 during the ''Warriors'' story-arc. He was an active participant of a gang war waged by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and newcomer [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. He didn't really side with anyone; he wanted the Kingpin and Hammerhead to be taken down, yet at the same time he considered Spider-Man to be a nuisance that needlessly put innocent lives in danger.

In the climax of the arc, Moon Knight along with several other characters, ambushed Hammerhead's penthouse. During the battle, he was impaled by the assassin [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].

Later, when Elektra was about to kill [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], Moon Knight managed to gain enough strength and subdue Elektra via a moon-blade to the head, saving Black Cat before he slipped into a coma. Upon waking up from his coma, Moon Knight escaped from custody at a city hospital and ended up in a three way fight between the Punisher and Spider-Man over the Kingpin.  Afterwards, Moon Knight was invited by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] to join an organization of super-heroes he would gather so they could bring down the Kingpin for good.

There was no mention of any supernatural origin to this Moon Knight, although it seemed clear that he was expert with weapons and martial arts. It was also noted that he had a form of dissociative identity disorder; the "identities" of Steven Grant, Marc Spector and Moon Knight all appeared as separate people in a "dream sequence" of sorts. There was also a little girl present in the dream, although whether or not she factors into Moon Knight's psyche remains to be seen.

===What If===
An alternate version of Moon Knight was also seen in the 2006 [[What If (comics)|What If]] one-shot: Wolverine: Enemy of the State. In that issue, a mind-controlled [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] kills Moon Knight. However, Logan then says that his employers, [[HYDRA]], will later resurrect Moon Knight as one of their killing machines. However, that story didn't get a follow-up and Spector's fate remains unresolved in that reality.
