Manfred Ellsworth Haller is the designer and owner of Haller Hydraulics which is boasted as the world leader in hydraulics. Manfred designed a powerful suit that would enable someone to explore hostile areas. He offered Sheriff Morris Walters a chance to prove its worth by capturing [[She-Hulk]]. Manfred believed that the publicity would endorse the suit. Drawing She-Hulk into action, Man-Elephant proved more than a match for her. Once the She-Hulk's believed crimes were groundless, Man-Elephant backed off realizing that the suit would also be a good potential for abuse.<ref>''Savage She-Hulk'' #17</ref>

[[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] considers Man-Elephant as a potential recruit.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''</ref>

Manfred Haller was put out of business by Tony Stark and his assets were frozen. He traveled to Timbuktu where an Indian wise woman told him about Ganesah and gave him a gem shard from [[Cyttorak]]. This transforms Manfred into '''Behemoth''' who then defends the locals from Tuareg rebels.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol 2 #25</ref>

Behemoth later tracked down She-Hulk to take revenge on her. She discovers that she is now a bounty hunter with her RV parked in New Jersey. However at the time, She-Hulk was in custody after helping the [[Lady Liberators]] in ousting a corrupt government of the country of Marinmer. She-Hulk's [[Skrull]] partner [[Jazinda]] posed as She-Hulk and was beaten by Behemoth.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol 2 #37</ref> Behemoth turned Jazinda over to the government who placed her in a military medical facility to be studied. Lurking around in human form in case She-Hulk turned up, Manfred as Behemoth attacked She-Hulk only to be attacked by [[Thundra]]. In the confusion, Jazinda turned into Behemoth and escaped as the real Behemoth is defeated by She-Hulk.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol 2 #38</ref>

The second Man-Elephant was created by the publishers and distributors of Marvel Comics. Marvel's adaption of She-Hulk's encounter with the original Man-Elephant few years prior prepetuated and exaggerated a bit by the writers. Through unknown means, this Man-Elephant came to life and confronted the real She-Hulk. Appearing at Marvel Comics to discuss their treatment in the past, She-Hulk clashed with her exaggerated counterpart and the Man-Elephant. With technology from his other world, Man-Elephant used it to turn elephants into humanoid version similar to himself to back up his schemes. Even with their accelerated mutation, the Man-Elephants retained their peaceful and docile behavior with some confusion over their transformations. Inciting them into violence, the Man-Elephant led them against the She-Hulk doppelganger (which was also released when Man-Elephant escaped) and defeated her. The real She-Hulk appeared on the scene backed up by a Marvel Comics intern named Tommy who was dressed as and calling himself the Gopher. The Man-Elephants then panicked and stampeded all over their leader. She-Hulk then sent Man-Elephant and the other She-Hulk back to where they came from.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #51</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Manfred used an elephant-themed suit which boosted his strength. He later gained a part of the Cyttorak gem, which turns him into the elephant-like Behemoth which has superhuman strength and durability.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol 2 #25</ref>

The second Man-Elephant has no powers, but possesses a devious nefarious mind.
