The '''Captain Britain Corps''' is a fictional league of [[super-heroes]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters are all known as, or appear as an alternative version of, [[Captain Britain]]. They are all essentially the same hero except they each come from an [[Marvel Comics Multiverse|alternative reality]].

==Fictional team history==
Founded by [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]], his daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] and Sir James Braddock, the Corps' main duty was to guard the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]]. Each member protected his or her reality based on their dimensional equivalent of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and was powered by the friction between dimensions.

Merlyn and Roma arranged for each chosen member of the Corps to gain superpowers, using any means, disguise or otherwise, possible.

===The making of Brian Braddock===
Merlyn chose [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]] to become [[Earth-616]]'s version of Captain Britain.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} After Braddock had adventured as Captain Britain for a few years, Merlyn sent Braddock to [[Earth-238]], where he overheard that this reality once had a [[Captain UK]], however Braddock was unsure of what this meant until he met [[Captain England]] and [[Captain Albion]] at a trial in another reality.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Back in his own home world, Braddock allied himself with Captain UK who had taken up home there after her Britain had become a fascist state and the heroes living there were targeted for a genocidal purge.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Together they fought the hero-killer [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]] after which Captains Britain and UK and their new ally [[Saturnyne]] were transported to Merlyn's home, [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]]. Here they discovered that Merlyn had apparently died.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Later they discover that it was one of his many ruses.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Otherworld===
<ref name=":0" /> For what seems like the first time, the Corps in their entirety attended Merlyn's funeral.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Afterwards Roma began taking a more direct approach with the Corps, even making Saturnyne her subordinate (mainly to keep an eye on her).{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She started bringing Corps members to the Starlight Citadel for training. Roma then added another duty to the Corps list of responsibilities. In addition to protecting their home realities, they must also take turns in defending Otherworld.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

During the adventures of Captain Britain (Braddock), Corpsmen would occasionally appear. These appearances are usually to observe important events (such as the wedding of [[Meggan]] and Braddock<ref name=":0" /> and the conclusion of the Cross-Time Caper){{Issue|date=April 2009}} or to carry out a sentence, as when they acted as jury at Braddock’s trial for breaching the Corps Code of Conduct.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Franklin Richards===
When Roma perceived [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] to be a threat, not only to his home reality (Earth-616) but to all of reality, she dispatched the [[Warwolves]], [[Gatecrasher (Marvel Comics)|Gatecrasher]] and her [[Technet (comics)|Technet]] to kidnap him.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} When her plan was being opposed by the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Alyssa Moy]], who was babysitting Franklin at the time, Roma teleported them all to Otherworld to face the full fury of the entire Corps.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Although they were hampered by having never worked as a team, the Corps eventually started wearing down the heroes, until Franklin used his [[Reality warping|reality manipulating]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers to supercharge his family who defeated the entire Captain Britain Corps. After a brief debate with [[Human Torch]], Roma agreed that Franklin should be left with his family.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

However, it was suggested that the entire kidnapping was just a ruse to let [[Alysande Stuart|Caledonia]], a former prisoner of Roma's starlight citadel, infiltrate the Fantastic Four's home as Franklin's nanny to prepare them for their forthcoming battle with [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Near destruction===
The Corps was nearly wiped out by Mastermind, a villainous computer belonging to Brian Braddock, and a group of mutated children known as the [[Jaspers' Warp#Warpies|Warpies]] (victims of the [[Jaspers' Warp]]), who were once the wards of Captain UK. Roma stepped down as omniversal guardian, giving the title to Brian Braddock, who became King of Otherworld and rebuilt the Corps.

When the insane mutant [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] altered reality in ''[[House of M]]'', another wave of destruction tore through Otherworld. Roma and Saturnyne, in an effort to save the omniverse, give Brian 48 hours to fix the tear in reality, or they will erase his Earth completely. With the sacrifice of Meggan, the heroes are able to seal the tear.<ref name=tuxm1>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #462-465</ref>

The corps rebuilt its ranks but once again it came under attack, this time from [[Mad Jim Jaspers]] and corps members which he began to turn into [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]]s.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The end of the battle saw Roma dead and most of the corps along with her. [[Saturnyne]] appointed Albion leader and told Captain Britain to stay and keep an eye on his reality as they rebuilt the corps once again.<ref name=dbts5>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' #5</ref>

===Uncanny X-Force===
Captain Britain Corps comes to Earth to arrest Fantomex for the murder of the young Apocalypse. Fantomex justifies his actions that the young Apocalypse will become evil, but Captain Britain suggest he never had a chance of redemption. During the trial the "Goat-Devil" lays siege to Otherworld and the Uncanny X-force come to save Fantomex from execution. Psylocke then realizes the Goat-Devil is actually her older brother from the future and tells Captain Britain to kill him. Captain Britain cannot do it himself, but lowers his psychic defenses and allows Psylocke to control him and kill Jamie Braddock, thus erasing The Goat from the future and ending the siege.<ref>Uncanny X-Force: Otherworld – June 6, 2012</ref>

===Time Runs Out===
During the events of "Time Runs Out", the Captain Britain Corps investigate universal Incursions which are causing the destruction of various realities, and the deaths of twenty Corpsmen. After the members of the Corps capture a Mapmaker, the [[Beyonders|Ivory Kings]] send their entire forces to overrun the Starlight Citadel, destroying the entire Corps. Saturnyne is able to teleport Brian Braddock to safety, leaving him as the Corps' only survivor.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #30</ref>

==Membership==
Although members usually call themselves simply "The Corps", other seems to attach their name to the Corps. For example, "[[Crusader X]] Corps" or the better known and most prevalent "Captain Britain Corps", which is better known since Braddock became King of Otherworld.

The Captain Britain Corps spans the multiverse and have a huge collection of members most of which go unnamed. The Corps, not only consists of [[Captain Britain#Alternate universe versions|alternative versions of Brian Braddock]] from throughout the multiverse, but also characters representing a vast array of different worlds, such as '''Hauptmann Englande''', a member representing a world where Nazis won [[World War II]] and  '''Captain Airstrip-One''' from a world based on  [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', while some even vary in species, like an animal version and even more exotic forms. While some members, like '''Captain U.K.''', have been utilized throughout many worlds,  she provided support for Braddock on Earth-616, and replaced the fallen Captains of Earth-794 and later Earth-839.

Membership is depleted following the attack by Mastermind and the Warpies, [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], and [[Mad Jim Jaspers|Jaspers return]], with the ranks slowly being rebuilt first under the command of Brian Braddock (Earth-616) and currently Albion.
