In [[Marvel Comics]], '''the Captain Britain Corps''' are a league of super-heroes all known as, or appear as an alternate version of, [[Captain Britain]]. They are all essentially the same hero except they each come from an alternate reality. They sometimes team up to face huge threats and are organized by the mystical entity [[Roma (comics)|Roma]].

==History==
===In the Beginning===
Founded by Merlyn, the Corps' main duty was to guard the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]]. Each member protected his or her reality based on their dimensional equivalent of [[Britain]], and was powered by the friction between dimensions.

Merlyn and his daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], arranged for each chosen member of the Corps to gain superpowers, using any means, disguise or otherwise, possible.

===The Making of Brian Braddock===
Merlyn chose [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]] to become [[Earth-616]]'s version of Captain Britain. After Braddock had adventured as Captain Britain for a few years, Merlyn sent Braddock to [[Earth-238]], where he overheard that this reality once had a [[Captain UK]], however Braddock was unsure of what this meant until he met [[Captain England]] and [[Captain Albion]] at a trial in another reality.

Back in his own home world, Braddock allied himself with Captain UK who had taken up home there after her Britain had become a fascist state and the heroes living there were targeted for a genocidal purge. Together the fought the hero killer, Fury after which, Britain, UK and their new ally [[Saturnyne]], were transported to [[Otherworld]]. Here they discovered that Merlyn had apparently died. Later they discover that it was one of his many ruses.

===Otherworld===
For what seems like the first time, the Corps in their entirety attended Merlyn's funeral. Afterwards Roma began taken a more direct approach with the Corps even making Saturnyne her subordinate, mainly to keep an eye on her, and started bringing Corps member to the Starlight Citadel for training. Roma then added another duty to the Corps list. As well as protecting their home realities, they also must take turns in defending Otherworld.

Every so often, during the adventures of Captain Britain (Braddock), Corpsmen would appear. Whether it be when Braddock's British superhero team, [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], ended their interdimensional cross-time caper to being on the jury when Braddock was tried for breaching the Corps Code of Conduct, either to observe or to carry out the sentence or to attend the wedding of [[Meggan (comics)|Meggan]] and Braddock.

===Franklin Richards===
When Roma perceived [[Franklin Richards]] to be a threat, not only to his home reality (Earth-616) but to all of reality; she dispatched the [[Warwolves]], [[Gatecrasher]] and her [[Technet]] to kidnap him. When her plan was being opposed by the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Alyssa Moy]], who was babysitting Franklin at the time, Roma teleported them all to Otherworld to face the full fury of the entire Corps.

Although they were hampered by having never worked as a team, the Corps eventually started wearing down the heroes, until Franklin used his reality manipulating mutant powers to supercharge his family who defeated the entire Captain Britain Corps. After a brief debate with [[Human Torch]], Roma agreed that Franklin should be left with his family.

However, it was suggested that the entire kidnapping was just a ruse to let [[Caledonia]], a former prisoner of Roma's starlight citadel, infiltrate the Fantastic Four's home as Franklin's nanny to prepare them for their forthcoming battle with [[Abraxas]].

===The Warpies===
More recently, the Corps was decimated by Mastermind, a villainous computer belonging to Brian Braddock, and a group of mutated children known as the Warpies, who were once the wards of Captain UK. It is unknown but reportedly only Captain UK and Crusader X (strangely changed into a Caucasian with blond hair) survived. Roma stepped down as omniversal guardian, giving the title to Brian Braddock, who became King of Otherworld and rebuilt the Corps.

===House of M===
When the insane mutant [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]] altered reality in [[House of M (story)|''House of M'']], another wave of destruction tore through Otherworld. Roma and Saturnyne, in an effort to save the omniverse, give Brian 48 hours to fix the tear in reality, or they will erase his Earth completely. With the sacrifice of Meggan, the heroes are able to seal the tear. It is unclear what exactly has happened to the entirety of the Captain Britain Corps after the destruction.

==Membership==
Although members usually call themselves simply "The Corps", other seems to attach their name to the Corps. An example "Crusader X Corps" or the better known and most prevalent "Captain Britain Corps", which is better known since Braddock became King of Otherworld.

===Known Members===
The Captain Britain Corps spans the multiverse and have a huge collection of members. After the Warpies decimated them it is unknown whether many of the members below are still alive as it was only reported that they were killed. With the amount of alternate Earths in the Marvel Universe some may have survived, who is unknown. The members in '''bold''' are the known members of the Corps who are still alive and part of the recreation of the team under Braddock.
