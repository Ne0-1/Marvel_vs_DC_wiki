'''Eclipso''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|p|s|oʊ}}) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. The character is the incarnation of the Wrath of [[God]] and the Angel of Vengeance that turned evil and was replaced by the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]].

==Fictional character biography==
Originally, Eclipso was written as a generic villain with average superpowers, who would routinely enact an elaborate plot to fulfill his hedonistic motivations. However, the ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within|Darkness Within]]'' miniseries modified the character to be an evil and megalomaniacal entity. Eclipso's character laments the power he once had as a spirit of divine vengeance. Eclipso would frequently seek to possess beings of incredible power like [[Superman]], [[Lar Gand]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to achieve his ends.

===Bruce Gordon===
Eclipso's early comics debut is tied to his first modern host, Bruce Gordon (named after [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] as an inside-joke),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcj.com/superhero/bob-haney-interviewed-by-michael-catron-part-four-of-five/?amp;utm_medium=rss&amp; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117162429/http://www.tcj.com/superhero/bob-haney-interviewed-by-michael-catron-part-four-of-five/?utm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dbob-haney-interviewed-by-michael-catron-part-four-of-five |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-01-17 |title=Bob Haney Interviewed by Michael Catron Part Four (of Five) « The Comics Journal |publisher=Tcj.com |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2011-01-16 }}</ref> a scientist specializing in solar energy. While in the jungle to view a solar eclipse, Gordon was attacked by a tribal sorcerer named Mophir. Before plunging to his death off a cliff, Mophir wounded Gordon with a black diamond. Afterwards, Gordon transformed into the villainous Eclipso whenever an eclipse occurred. A blue-gray or purple circle covered the rightmost two-thirds of his face, resembling a partial eclipse. Gordon experienced many [[Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde|Jekyll-and-Hyde]] transformations and misadventures in ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]''. During this period, Eclipso was portrayed as a conventional villain, possessing super strength, partial invulnerability, and eye blasts (aided by his black diamond). Eclipso's transformations were later altered so that any type of natural eclipse, lunar or solar, would cause Eclipso and Gordon to split from one another, while an "artificial eclipse" -- an object blocking out a light source -- would merely transform Gordon to Eclipso. Any bright flash of light would banish Eclipso back into Bruce Gordon's body or reverse the change.

====''The Darkness Within''====
{{main|Eclipso: The Darkness Within}}
[[Image:WWAnnual3.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Wonder Woman]] possessed by Eclipso. Art by [[Joe Quesada]].]]
In the early 1990s, DC [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] Eclipso in a company-wide [[fictional crossover|crossover]] built around the [[miniseries]] ''Eclipso: The Darkness Within''. Eclipso was revealed not simply to be Bruce Gordon's dark half, but a vengeance demon who had possessed Gordon. Eclipso's soul had originally been bound inside a giant black diamond called the "Heart of Darkness" in Africa. A treasure hunter found it in the late nineteenth century and brought it to London in 1891, where he had a jeweler cut it into one thousand shards. This weakened the binding spell, allowing Eclipso to possess anyone who became angry while in contact with one of the shards. He was no longer limited to possessing Gordon during an eclipse, but pretended otherwise so that Gordon would not know the truth about the black diamonds.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Over the next century, the Eclipso entity gathered the diamond shards with the intention of destroying them all, freeing his true power. When [[Lar Gand]] discovered Eclipso's palace on the moon and wandered inside, it inspired Eclipso to possess all of Earth's heroes and use them towards his ultimate goal, the conquest of Earth and revenge against God for imprisoning him inside the Heart of Darkness. Eclipso claimed he had spent the last several years "posing as a B-level villain" in order to remain undetected by Earth's heroes and had limited himself to targeting Gordon for the purpose of quashing Gordon's research into solar science. If Gordon had achieved his goal of making solar energy the planet's primary energy source, any solar-powered device could be used as a weapon against Eclipso.

In the climax of the story, several of Earth's heroes were possessed by Eclipso and transported to the moon during an eclipse. He then absorbed these heroes into his own body, gaining their mass and also their inherent powers. Gordon led a group of heroes armed with solar weapons to the moon in an attempt to defeat Eclipso once and for all. The absorbed heroes were freed in the end, but only after [[Starman (comics)|Will Payton]] destroyed Eclipso's moon base by detonating his own solar-powered body. Eclipso's diamond shards remained on Earth.

====''Eclipso'' series====
Following the crossover event, Eclipso appeared in a solo series. He conquered the South American country of Parador by possessing one person at a time. The United States sent an investigation team consisting of [[Cave Carson]], Bruce Gordon, and Gordon's fiancé, Mona Bennet. Carson's legs were broken and he was left at the border.

Gordon and Bennet were taken on a tour and shown various atrocities, such as piles of children's corpses. They escaped with the assistance of the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]] and formed a group of heroes dubbed the [[Shadow Fighters]]. This group was led by [[Amanda Waller]], formerly of the [[Suicide Squad]]. In issue #13 of the series, Eclipso defeated them, killing [[Yolanda Montez|Wildcat II]], the second [[Beth Chapel|Dr. Midnight]], the Creeper, [[Commander Steel]], [[Manhunter (Mark Shaw)|Manhunter IV]] (a Mark Shaw ringer), and [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]]. Creeper has returned to action in his own series.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] was also involved in this action. He died in a helicopter crash while trying to destroy Eclipso's [[tank]]s. These tanks were attacking the sole surviving member of the Shadow Fighter attack force, [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]].

The other survivors of the Shadow Force, those who had not attacked Eclipso directly, regrouped. Eclipso attacked them with a Parador missile which they evaded using [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]]'s teleportation ability. During the escape, Mona's father was snatched from their vehicle, but he later returned alive. The survivors arrived in the [[United Nations]] building, just in time to foil another plot of Eclipso by landing their vehicle on his intended victim.

Bruce Gordon and Mona Bennet led the Earth's superheroes in an attack on Parador, in an attempt to destroy Eclipso once and for all. Eclipso revealed that he dare not kill Gordon and Bennet, because their unborn child will time travel to the past as an adult and free Eclipso from the diamond.

Eclipso was finally defeated when the [[Phantom Stranger]] gathered all one thousand black diamond shards and fused them back together into the Heart of Darkness, imprisoning Eclipso again. His physical body, the adult child of Bennet and Gordon, evaporated in front of his parents.

====Spectre====
Later in the 1990s, the series ''[[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]]'' gave key revelations about Eclipso. The Spectre was not the first embodiment of the wrath of God, but was Eclipso's replacement. Series writer [[John Ostrander]] chose to portray this as a distinction between the Spectre's pursuit of "vengeance" and Eclipso's pursuit of "revenge". In a Biblical context, Eclipso was responsible for [[Noah's Flood]], while the Spectre was the [[Death (personification)#Death (angels) in religion|Angel of Death]] who slew the first-born Egyptian children.

The Spectre destroys the Heart of Darkness along with the remains of Eclipso's palace on the moon, burning them to ash with the Holy Power of God and casting the ashes into space.

===Alex Montez===
[[Image:Eclipsomontez.png|150px|Alex Montez as Eclipso. Art by John Watson.|thumb]]
Eclipso returns after several years' absence in the "Princes of Darkness" storyline in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' as an ally of the other villains [[Mordru]] and [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]]. Alexander Montez, cousin of Yolanda, vows revenge on Eclipso for Yolanda's death. To this end, he gathers the 1,000 black diamonds, liquifies them and injects them into himself; all save one, which he keeps to evoke Eclipso. Exactly how Eclipso's diamonds had returned was unknown. Montez covers his body in tribal tattoos he claims he had learned about on Diablo Island. With these tattoos, Montez can summon all the powers of Eclipso by triggering the diamond with his anger, while remaining in control of himself and keeping Eclipso trapped within. As the new Eclipso, he joins the short-lived team of loose-cannon heroes assembled by [[Black Adam]], which was the subject of the subsequent storyline "Black Reign".

During Adam's reign in [[Kahndaq]], Alex becomes romantically involved with his teammate Soseh Mykros, the female [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]]. However, during a battle, one of Alex's binding glyphs (which keeps Eclipso in control) is broken via a shoulder wound. Eclipso soon kills Nemesis. Alex commits suicide in order to prevent Eclipso from controlling him further. This story was significant as it meant that Eclipso no longer had a limitless number of black diamonds waiting out in the world for him to utilize.

This incarnation of Eclipso was never shown using any power but his eye blasts.

In ''Countdown to Mystery'' #4, Alex's body is acquired by Eclipso's followers for an as-yet-unknown magic ritual. In #6, all of the black diamond fragments in his body are recombined into their original form.

==="Lightning Strikes Twice"===
Despite the loss of the other black diamonds, the disembodied Eclipso then tries to possess Superman by antagonizing him through many deaths.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #826 (June 2005)</ref> He eventually possesses Superman by upsetting him via his possession of [[Lois Lane]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #639 (June 2005)</ref> At this point, the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] steps in by sending Captain Marvel to fight the possessed Eclipso-Superman. Thanks to Superman's weakness to magic, Captain Marvel is able to do a significant amount of damage to Eclipso. A prominent method of attack he uses is to continuously trigger his transformations in close proximity to Superman, resulting in the lightning striking Eclipso.<ref name=s216>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #216 (June 2005)</ref>

Eventually, Shazam himself removes Eclipso from Superman by calling upon the hostless Spectre himself to do it. The Spectre forces Eclipso back into a lone black diamond. The Spectre then warns Shazam that he has made an enemy of Eclipso and that the currently-hostless Spectre will no longer be able to defend him as he lacks the coherence necessary to effectively recall anything beyond his 'mission'. At the end of this series, the black diamond is seen appearing in [[Jean Loring]]'s cell in [[Arkham Asylum]].<ref name=s216 />

===Jean Loring===
[[Image:Eclipsojean.png|Jean Loring as Eclipso. Art by Justiniano.|thumb]]
{{main|Jean Loring}}

In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which tied into the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event, [[Jean Loring]], ex-wife of [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]] (Ray Palmer) and murderer of [[Sue Dibny]] as seen in the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, discovered the last black diamond in her prison cell, became the new Eclipso and tricked Spectre into attacking magic-based heroes as her revenge against Shazam, who was eventually slain while fighting the Spectre. After fending off multiple attacks upon herself, Eclipso-Loring was eventually teleported to a non-decaying [[orbit]] around the sun by [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]].

In the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', it was revealed by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] that he had sent [[Superboy-Prime]] to recover the black diamond and that the [[Psycho-Pirate]] delivered it to Loring on Alex's orders and manipulated Eclipso into manipulating the Spectre. This was all done in the interests of breaking magic down into raw magical energy, which Alexander could use for his own ends. The death of Shazam was particularly useful, as his various champions then became a tether of power. All Alex had to do was capture one of them, make them say 'Shazam' and they would summon their lightning bolt to power his machine.

In Week Twenty-Seven of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]], on a quest to restore his wife Sue to life and guided by the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]], approaches the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] and promises to fulfill any bargain that the Spectre demands in order to restore his wife to life.

The Spectre, desiring revenge on Eclipso for his manipulations of him during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' but rendered incapable of taking it owing to his present lack of a host, orders Dibny to punish Eclipso in return for his wife's life. Dibny, realizing that this meant punishing [[Jean Loring]], his wife's murderer, and temporarily granted the power of the Spectre, takes Eclipso back to the point at which she (as Jean Loring) murdered his wife and, restoring Jean's sanity, ruthlessly intends to trap her in a permanent time loop and force her to watch herself murder Sue Dibny over and over for all eternity.

Her sanity restored and Eclipso purged out of her, a terrified Loring tearfully begs for forgiveness, screaming that she was crazy when she murdered Sue and that it 'wasn't me!'. Dibny, affected by her pleas, his sense of compassion and his own feelings on watching his wife's death, finds himself incapable of such ruthlessness and refuses to complete his pact with the Spectre, returning Eclipso to her orbit around the sun.

She has most recently been seen in ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' #16, searching for a new host. Having come to the conclusion that her hosts' corrupted souls are a cause of her failures, she tries to possess a baby with great magical potential and a pure, uncorrupted soul. She is foiled in this attempt by [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]] and [[Traci Thirteen]]. She even manages to take control of Blue Beetle and grants him his "supreme desire of power", intending to use the corrupted Beetle to kill the defenders of the baby. To her utter mortification, this means Beetle's supreme wish, to become a dentist in order to provide for his family, is fulfilled, and is easily swatted aside.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' (vol. 7) #16 (August 2007)</ref>

It was revealed in ''Countdown To Mystery'' that all of Eclipso's black diamonds were mined on [[Apokolips]] millennia ago and that Eclipso was created by [[Darkseid]].

In "The Seduction of the Innocent" ad campaign for DC's ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'', Eclipso's arm can be clearly seen, with [[Mary Marvel]] looking off-page and her face half-shadowed. Indeed, Eclipso is seen in [[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]] #38 watching [[Mary Marvel]] and plotting to make Mary into her minion. Increasing her anger and suspicions around the other magical being around her, she manages to warp the sunny and cheery disposition of Mary into sheer anger and distrust and then offer herself as friend and confidante. After attempting to make her Darkseid's concubine, however, Mary rebels and attempts to kill her.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''Countdown To Mystery'', Eclipso corrupts more heroes, first [[Plastic Man]] and then setting her sights on the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]]. Mary discovers Eclipso's manipulation of her and in ''Countdown'' #17 she sacrifices her abilities and attacks Eclipso with all her power, leaving Mary and Jean freefalling to the oceans surrounding [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]]. Loring is last seen sinking into the ocean with a shark approaching and Eclipso returns to inhabit Bruce Gordon, declaring her lost.

====''Countdown to Mystery''====
In the ''Countdown to Mystery'' series, Eclipso puts a new plan into motion, corrupting the heroes [[Plastic Man]], [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], and [[Hawk and Dove|Dove]], and at the same time tasking a group of magi to recover and recombine the pieces of the Heart of Darkness.

In ''Countdown to Mystery'' #3, [[Crispus Allen]], the Spectre's current host, tracks down Bruce Gordon. In #4, Eclipso once again takes Gordon as a host. Then, in #5, Bruce is shown to have some control over Eclipso's powers, but can be overwhelmed by his persona if he uses too much at once. In #7, Bruce manages to free the heroes from their corruption, but is overwhelmed by Eclipso when his ex-wife is threatened. Eclipso then joins with the completed Heart of Darkness, exponentially increasing his powers, and faces off against the Spectre. In #8, Bruce, spurred on by Crispus, finally manages to take control of Eclipso, although the two cannot be separated.

====Rise of Eclipso====
During the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event, a mysterious being known as [[Life Entity|The Entity]] tells [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] to help her brother, [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]] "balance the darkness", as he will ultimately save her friends from an unidentified threat. As the Entity says this, a grinning vision of Eclipso appears behind Jade.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref>

Following this, Eclipso reawakens within Bruce, destroying Diablo Island and apparently killing Mona in the process. Eclipso subsequently kidnaps the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], [[Acrata]], [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]], [[Shadow Thief]], a French supervillainess named Bette Noir and a Canadian superhero named Dark Crow, all of whom possess shadow-based abilities. After brainwashing his captives and bringing them under his mental control, Eclipso travels to an extradimensional plane, where he frees a demonic entity known as [[Ctulhu|Sythunu]], who agrees to serve Eclipso. With his small team ready, Eclipso travels to the Emerald City that [[Alan Scott]] established on the moon, stating that he now wishes to capture Jade.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #54 (February 2011)</ref> After taking over Jade, Eclipso defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster (consisting of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]], [[Red Tornado]], [[Animal Man]], [[Tasmanian Devil (comics)|Tasmanian Devil]], and [[Bulleteer]]), and then badly injures the angel [[Zauriel]]. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #56 (April 2011)</ref> Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams to attract the attention of the new Spectre, [[Crispus Allen]]. The Spectre arrives on the moon, where Eclipso ambushes and kills him, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive, and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #57 (May 2011)</ref> With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills [[Donna Troy]], the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #58 (June 2011)</ref> However, it is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by [[Saint Walker]], who used his blue [[power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and [[Starman (comics)#Mikaal Tomas|Starman]] break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #59 (July 2011)</ref>

===The New 52===
{{Update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2013}}
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Eclipso is depicted as the god of vengeance and once again trapped in the Heart of Darkness.<ref>''Team 7'' (vol. 2) #2 (January 2013)</ref> However a criminal organization working for [[Kaizen Gamorra]] tries to steal the item with Team 7]] trying to stop them. During the fight [[Slade Wilson]] is briefly possessed by Eclipso.<ref>''Team 7'' (vol. 2) #3 (February 2013)</ref> With the help of [[Red Hood and the Outlaws|Essence]] the other heroes manage to trap him again in the black diamond, which is then sent to somewhere safe.<ref>''Team 7'' (vol. 2) #4 (March 2013)</ref> Five years later, Catwoman is hired to steal the diamond, now kept in one of A.R.G.U.S secret rooms; she succeeds although she is affected by the item's magic.<ref>''Catwoman'' (vol. 4) #15 (February 2013)</ref>

Eclipso is subsequently revealed to be an inhabitant of [[Gemworld]] with the powers of House Onyx and House Diamond and was once '''Kalaa''' of the planet Gilaa. <ref>''Team 7'' #3</ref>He was trapped in the diamond by the then Princess of House Amethyst centuries ago.<ref>''Sword of Sorcery ''(vol 2) #6 (May 2013)</ref> Now possessing Dr. Alex Montez, he is sent back to Gemworld by [[John Constantine]], where he seizes control of the two Houses he's connected to.<ref>''Sword of Sorcery ''(vol 2) #7 (June 2013)</ref> Seeking revenge on House Amethyst, he is defeated by [[Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld|Princess Amaya]] and again trapped in the diamond.<ref>''Sword of Sorcery ''(vol 2) #8 (July 2013)</ref> 

Later, the black diamond is delivered to scientist '''Gordon Jacobs''', who has fallen from grace. Using Gordon's rage, Eclipso from inside the gem manipulated him into cutting himself with the gem so he can possess him. After taking his body Eclipso murders Jonah Bennet, Gordon's partner and father of his fiancée, Mona, who has come to visit Gordon but after that Gordon realizes that he was out of control and he must destroy the gem but Eclipso tells him that if he does he will also kill himself because they are one and the same now. Eclipso also manipulates and convinces Gordon not to throw away the gem using Mona as an excuse. However, Eclipso warns that if the diamond and he are destroyed, the blood bond between them means Gordon will die too. Manipulatively, Eclipso reminds that with Jonah's death, Gordon must be there to comfort her, and soon, Gordon is convinced. <ref>''Justice League Dark'' #23.1 </ref>

===DC Rebirth===
In ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' event ''Justice League vs. Suicide Squad'', [[Maxwell Lord]] uses a team of [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]], [[Johnny Sorrow]], [[Emerald Empress]], Rustam and [[Doctor Polaris]] - identified as the original incarnation of the [[Suicide Squad]] - to steal the Heart of Darkness from a vault in [[Amanda Waller]]'s base, allowing him to expand his powers to take control of the Justice League and the people of the world. Using the Heart of Darkness, Maxwell Lord 'succeeds' in bringing 'peace' across America but it quickly degenerates into mass hysteria as the crystal corrupts those around him. However, Amanda Waller is able to snap Maxwell Lord back to his senses and he realizes that the Heart of Darkness is manipulating his power in order to sow rioting and chaos. <ref>''Justice League vs. Suicide Squad'' #3</ref> Before Waller can help Lord remove the Heart of Darkness, it infects Lord and turns him into a host for Eclipso, leaving only [[Batman]] and the Suicide Squad to stand against his Justice League in a showdown at the White House (having been transported there by Cyborg via Boom Tube, Cyborg's mechanical components helping him resist the Heart of Darkness's influence long enough to help Batman and the Squad). Eclipso is able to take over most of the Squad by drawing on their darker desires, but Batman and Lobo are able to hold them off long enough for [[Killer Frost]] to use her powers to create a prism, perfectly modulated to reflect Superman's heat vision at a frequency that will drive Eclipso back. With his hold weakened, Eclipso attempts to escape by drawing on Killer Frost's darkest desire, but since all she truly wants deep down is to make a difference, she is able to throw Eclipso off, leaving him trapped in the diamond once again while Lord is imprisoned. <ref>''Justice League vs. Suicide Squad'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Eclipso is the primordial manifestation of God's wrath and was responsible for the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]] of Biblical fame. A magical being of incalculable strength, Eclipso has demonstrated the powers of flight, immortality, invulnerability, super speed and stamina, advanced intellect, and the ability to emit deadly rays of dark light from his left eye and a powerful burst of paralyzing black light from his right eye by looking through a shard of the Heart of Darkness gem. He carries with him a seemingly unbreakable mystical sword and is a considerable swordsman.<ref name=jlroe>''Justice League: Rise of Eclipso''</ref>

Eclipso possesses vast magical powers that allow him to perform such godlike feats as manipulation of the weather and seas to cause natural disasters (floods, thunderstorms, etc.), increasing his size to that of a giant, absorbing the powers of the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], and projecting powerful energy from his hands that can stun or kill his opponents. As a former servant of God, Eclipso is able to "speak" the angelic language; a combination of harmony, discordance, vibration and telepathy.<ref name=jlroe /> In later publishing his powers have grown ever still, showcasing vast cosmological if not reality bending capability at his peak being able to cause a solar eclipse drowning the entire world in darkness.  

Eclipso is able to overshadow anyone who touches or comes into contact with the cursed Heart of Darkness gem, controlling the host's powers and influencing their behaviors and memories to Eclipso's own ends. He can then strengthen his host by either enhancing their normal capabilities or bestowing them with new powers. In his later appearances Eclipso boasts even greater possession power than previously seen and after possessing Maxwell Lord, his abilities to possess and corrupt people were intensified. No longer needing people to physically touch the stone for him to affect them, he can remotely possess multiple hosts providing he can corrupt them first. Furthermore, his influence can exacerbate the darker impulses of individuals who come under his sway and those whom he possesses undergo a visible transformation; gaining a more monstrous physical appearances. He can physically shift his main hosts body into his true, more powerful, physical form. 

Despite his power, he is still bound by the divine laws of the [[Presence (DC Comics)|Presence]] and is subject to even greater punishment from the Presence himself if these bounds are crossed.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Eclipso appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Eclipsed". Although never referred to by name, Eclipso is characterized as the collective souls of an evil race of serpent-like humanoids called "Ophidians", who imprisoned themselves in a black diamond called the "Heart of Darkness" to eventually destroy the human race. One of Eclipso's possessed human hosts, '''General McCormick''' (voiced by [[Bruce McGill]]), appears wearing the original Eclipso costume worn by Bruce Gordon, having been told by one of the general's colleagues that the best way to lure out the Justice League is to "put on a gaudy costume and threaten to hurt a lot of people". This Eclipso attempts to permanently darken the sun and possess all of the Justice League except the Flash and Batman (Batman did not appear in this episode). At first, Eclipso possesses one member of the team at a time as the black diamond is passed from hand to hand, but when [[Hawkgirl]] hastily smashes the stone, all but Flash become dusted with the fragments and are possessed as a group. However, the Flash was able to drive the spirits out of his teammates and subsequently helped them create a wormhole to drain away the black energy 'Eclipso' was using to darken the sun. Mophir (voiced by [[Tracey Walter]]) still exists in this version, but instead of helping to create Eclipso, he is a member of a tribe that guards the Heart of Darkness diamond and fights the Ophidians whenever they manage to possess a human host.
