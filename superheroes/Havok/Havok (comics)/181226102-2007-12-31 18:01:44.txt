'''Havok''' ('''Alexander "Alex" Summers''') is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a member of the [[X-Men]].  Created by writer [[Arnold Drake]] and artist [[Don Heck]], he first appeared in ''[[Marveldatabase: Uncanny X-Men 54|X-Men #54]]'' ([[1969#March|March 1969]]).  He is the son of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] and brother of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]].

A [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], Havok generates powerful “plasma blasts”, an ability he has had difficulty controlling.  He is the younger brother of the X-Men’s [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and older brother of [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]].  He often resents Cyclops’ authoritative attitude and reputation as a model X-Man. 

In contrast, Havok and his longtime love interest [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] have had a love/hate relationship with the team, often finding themselves roped into it.  Both were also members of the [[1990s]]-era [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]-sponsored mutant team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].  After X-Factor disbanded, Havok starred in ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]],'' a series in which he explored a strange [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]].  He has since returned to the X-Men.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Alexander Summers was born in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. He is the second of the three sons of [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher Summers]], a [[United States Air Force]] Major and test pilot and his wife Katherine Anne. When Alex was a boy growing up in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], [[United States]], his father took the family for a flight in their airplane, which came under attack by a [[Shi'ar]] spaceship. As the plane caught fire and was crashing, his parents fastened Alex and his older brother, Scott, into a parachute and pushed them off the plane in hopes that they would survive.

The Summers boys were recovered and put into an orphanage and Alex was soon adopted though his brother Scott remained there for much of his childhood. Alex was raised by the Blandings; a family whose son, Todd, had died in a car accident<ref>''X-Factor'' #-1</ref>. They tried to make Alex fit into the image of their son, and he tried to do as best he could. When the boy responsible for Todd's death kidnapped Alex and his foster sister, Haley, Alex manifested his powers for the first time, incinerating the boy.  [[Mister Sinister]], an evil geneticist who was obsessed with the Summers bloodline, appeared eager yet surprised that Alex’s potential exceeded Scott's -- despite the fact that he seemed to lack control over his gift. Sinister placed psi-blocks on both Alex and Haley's minds, causing them to forget what had happened that night.

===First encounter with X-Men===
Alex went on to study and earn a degree in [[geophysics]] at college. His mutant powers became apparent when he was kidnapped by the [[Living Monolith|Living Pharaoh]], who declared Alex the only being able to rival his power. The two shared the same cosmic energy-absorption abilities, in reverse proportion to each other. By locking Alex in a shielded cell, the Pharaoh was able to absorb enough cosmic energy to become the Living Monolith. The X-Men fought a losing battle against the virtually unstoppable Monolith, until Alex managed to free himself, and the Monolith turned back into the Living Pharaoh.

Alex's mutant power at first seemed to manifest itself only when he was near death. He was unable to control it, and feared its immense power.  

Alex was later captured by [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]] and his [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]], who were bent on controlling or eradicating all mutants. Trask fashioned a costume for Alex that would help him control his powers and Alex took the code name Havok. Trask turned out to be a mutant himself and the Sentinels were defeated by the X-Men. Now able to control his power, Havok actively joined the X-Men and began a relationship with Lorna Dane, [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], much to the anger of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] who was romantically interested in her as well. While the senior X-Men were in the Savage Land, Havok and Polaris were approached by [[Professor X]] about the imminent invasion of the alien Z’Nox. During this time, the couple fell in love.

Havok and Polaris were occasional members and allies of the X-Men for years. They alternated between doing graduate work and earning a [[postgraduate]] degree in the American Southwest - where they occasionally encountered the Hulk - and helping out [[Moira MacTaggert]] at her facility for genetic research on Muir Island, off the coast of Scotland. 

During one of their adventures, Polaris was possessed by the mutant [[Marauders (comics)|Marauder]] [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], ending the romantic relationship for a time.

===Wolverine===
Havok befriended [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in the late [[1980s]] and they shared some adventures together in the miniseries ''[[Meltdown (comic series)|Meltdown]]''. While they were vacationing in Mexico, they were targeted by a terrorist cell. They managed to deal with their hunters, but were fooled by a damsel in distress who was actually a member of the terrorist group. Havok woke up in a hospital, in the care of nurse Scarlett McKenzie, the assassin without disguise. She manipulated Havok and made him fall in love with her. Scarlett was working for the Russian scientist, Dr. Neutron, aka Meltdown, who wanted to use Havok as a means to absorb the entire energy of an atom reactor, breaking it down and transmuting it into himself. Scarlett fed Alex with false information that terrorists were trying to sabotage the plant. When he ventured into the heart of the reactor, he found it shortly before reaching critical limit. According to plan, Havok tried to absorb the dangerous radiation; however, when he witnessed Meltdown killing Scarlett, he blasted him, making himself stronger. The arrival of Wolverine prevented a full disaster after Logan killed Meltdown, and Havok redirected the nuclear radiation into space.

During this period, Havok became involved with [[Madelyne Pryor]]. Both of them had been rejected by their previous lovers, her then-husband Cyclops had left her for Jean Grey. Madelyne was manipulated by [[N'astirh]] and became the Goblin Queen. She attempted to use Havok to help take over the world and transform it into a demonic realm. Havok eventually came to his senses and Madelyne killed herself after discovering she was a clone of Jean Grey.

===Genosha===
After going through [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] with several other X-Men fleeing the cyborg hunters [[Reavers (comics)|The Reavers]], Havok ended up amnesiac in [[Genosha]]; a country that used mutants and genetically-engineered slaves called Mutates. He became a high-ranking Magistrate in the Genoshan army. His fellow X-Men had no idea of what had happened to him until, during the ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'', the Genoshan government kidnapped members of the mutant teams X-Men, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the [[New Mutants]]. During a pitched battle with his brother, Cyclops, Havok's memory returned, but he kept it a secret hoping to catch the Genoshan leader, [[Cameron Hodge]], off guard. He succeeded and was the one to deliver the killing blow to Hodge.

===X-Factor===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Havok-Xfactor.jpg|thumb|left|Havok as he appeared in X-Factor.]] -->
Havok and Polaris eventually reunited and he became the leader of the government-sponsored X-Factor. Havok led the team effectively for quite some time. He dealt with the unwilling, unwitting affections of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], the physical problems of [[Strong Guy]] and various public relations disasters, such as the destruction of the Washington Monument. Much of the team's bad image was ochestrated by [[Mr. Sinister]], his [[Nasty Boys]] and a mutant senator who could cause bad luck. He dealt physically with [[Random (comics)|Random]] and personally, as they clashed for various reasons. He grew in new directions as a leader, once seemingly drinking poison in an effort to buck up the spirits of Strong Guy, who had been poisoned. (What Alex drank had been water).

Havok and X-Factor were called upon to subvert a civil war aggravated by the Pantheon. In this instance, Alex physically challenged the Hulk and by soaking up the various energies that fuel Banner, using them to bolster his plasma blasts, Havok had the advantage. It was the second time Havok had beaten the Hulk<ref>the first time Alex beat Hulk was in ''Incredible Hulk'' #150</ref>.

During this time, Havok's team participated in the events of the [[Infinity War]] and the [[Infinity Crusade]]. Alex and Strong Guy participated the most in far reaching, reality altering cosmic battles. 

[[Multiple Man]] had gained the Legacy Virus in Genosha and thus, later chose to undergo a seemingly mystical healing effort<ref>''X-Factor'' #100</ref>. Despite the previous success with Wolfsbane, which cured her of her unatural love for Alex, Multiple Man perished. This hit Havok hard, as he felt he was ultimately responsible since [[Madrox]] was under his command. He left the team for a while and went to Hawaii, where he and Polaris enjoyed a romantic honeymoon until Malice and  Mr. Sinister and The Nasty Boys showed up. Reinforcements helped Havok and Polaris survive the villains. Shortly afterwards Strong Guy suffered a heart attack and ended up in stasis. Wolfsbane left to be with her foster mother. 

After the [[Age of Apocalypse]] event was over Havok accidentally destroyed a dam and was forced back into his old containment suit. After new members Wild Child, Shard and Mystique were introduced to the team, Havok fought Random and was captured by The [[Dark Beast]]. He was brainwashed into serving Dark Beast and Onslaught. He broke free of the brainwashing, but used it as an opportunity to infiltrate the enemy and recreated a version of The [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. He succeeded in defeating the Dark Beast and attempted to mend fences with his former X-Factor teammates, specifically Polaris and the resurrected Multiple Man (the man who had died had been a duplicate).

While Havok was attempting to reform X-Factor, one of his time-traveling team members, [[Greystone (comics)|Greystone]] created an experimental time travel device to return him to the future. It exploded in mid-air, seemingly killing Havok and [[Greystone]] in front of their teammates.

===Mutant X===
[[Image:Mutant X.jpg|thumb|right|Havok as he appeared in Mutant X.]]
In actuality, Havok was cast into a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] where he was the leader of a drastically altered version of X-Factor, known as The Six. In this world, he was the leader of the original X-Men, since his brother Cyclops was abducted by the [[Shi'ar]] along with his parents. He found he was married to Madelyne Pryor, with whom he had a son named Scotty, and all his friends were twisted versions of the ones he knew. Despite being unfamilar with this realm, Havok willingly took over the role of father, for Scotty, though the boy knew he was not really his dad. Havok leads a group known as the Six and his adventures in this other reality lead to a disastrous adventure which left most superhumans on that world dead. Havok was able to save the world itself before being cast into black nothingness.

===Resurrection===
However, Havok's body was found back in the original reality in a comatose state. The X-Men were able to restore his psyche with the help of the son of Havok's nurse, [[Annie Ghazikhanian]]. When he was reunited with Polaris, she asked him to marry her, which he never actually answered. Beast immediately congratulated them and Havok didn't say anything about it. More than likely it was because he had a feeling that he should want to marry Polaris, but didn't voice the fact that his love for her had been effectively deleted and replaced. Unknown to Havok and Polaris, Annie's telepathic son Carter used his powers to cause Annie and Havok to fall in love in their dreams. Annie was lonely and Carter felt that a reciprocated love from Alex is what she needed.  During Lorna and Alex's wedding, Alex called off the marriage and Lorna, affected by the disasters at [[Genosha]], tried to kill them, only to be stopped by Juggernaut and Havok.

Havok and Annie maintained their relationship even after Carter's involvement in the situation was revealed. When Iceman helped protect Carter and Annie, Annie expressed her thanks by kissing Iceman who was at the time with Polaris. Havok still cared for Annie as well as Carter. However, the destruction of the X-Mansion at the hands of a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] led by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] caused Annie to leave Havok and take her son away from the X-Men on the basis that it was no longer safe for the two to live at the mansion if constantly under attack.

===Decimation===
With Annie and Carter now gone, Havok's mind seems to be mending since he expressed feelings to resume his relationship with Polaris, who moved on after being rejected and was dating her former boyfriend Iceman. During the post "House of M" storyline, many mutants lost their powers. When Polaris revealed that she had lost her powers, she left the X-Men, and Havok decided to leave with her. However, after Polaris' and his encounter with the creature called "Daap," in which Lorna was abducted, Havok returned to the X-Mansion to see a Sphinx bearing the face of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

He then returned to active duty to assist the remainder of his squad, Rogue and Iceman, along with new member Mystique, in bringing down Apocalypse.  Havok single-handedly destroyed the antidote to Apocalypse's meta-plague and a key element in his plan to decimate the human population. [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] was turned into a horseman and he clashed with Havok and the other X-Men. During the last battle, Iceman struck down [[Polaris (comics)|Pestilence]], who was revealed to be Polaris. As her esophagus closed down, Havok administered CPR to save her life, but was infected with the meta-plague. Luckily, Emma Frost saved some of the antidote Havok destroyed earlier and cured him with it.

===The Rise and Fall of The Shi'ar Empire===
Havok was recruited by [[Professor X]]<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #475</ref>, along with Marvel Girl ([[Rachel Summers]]), [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]] and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] to participate in a space mission to stop [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] from unleashing his powers on the [[Shi'ar]] empire. Havok has recently been reunited with [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], his father, and brought him news about Vulcan. His current relationship with Polaris is still developing. Polaris seems to finally show concrete signs of forgiving Havok, telling him to "just shut up and kiss" her after the team won their first battle against the entire regiment of Shi'ar soldiers in their beginning struggle against [[D'Ken]] and in support of [[Lilandra]]<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #484</ref>. Although Havok initially rebuffs her advances, hesitant to "start up again after" everything that happened between them, Lorna says that he needs to "blow off some steam" and the scene ends with them kissing. During the final battle<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #486</ref>, Corsair tries to reason with his son Vulcan but he kills him where he stands. Havok, enraged by this, launches an attack at his brother with intention of killing him, but is easily defeated. In the end, Nightcrawler, Warpath and Hebizbah get the injured Professor X and Darwin back to the ship, but Lilandra sends the ship back to Earth, leaving Havok and his teammates stranded.

===Starjammers===
Havok along with Polaris, Rachel, Korvus, Ch'od and Raza form a new team of Starjammers after the death of Corsair, dedicated to defeating Vulcan and restoring Lilandra to the throne<ref>''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan''</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==

Havok is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] possessing the power to absorb ambient [[cosmic rays|cosmic energy]], process it and emanate it from his body as waves of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the form of a blast or discharge, with a tell-tale concentric circle pattern.  These waves will emanate from his body in all directions unless he purposefully tries to channel them in a single direction, usually along the length of his arms.  This results in control over an extremely powerful sort of destructive force.  He is immune to the adverse effects of most forms of radiation and heat.  At times, he is not entirely able to control this ability, which sometimes makes him a danger to those around him unless he wears a special containment suit to assist him.  Havok is immune to his own powers and to those of his brother Scott. He is resistant but not immune to Vulcan's powers.

Despite past accounts, the energy that Havok releases is not truly a concussive force.  When Havok strikes an object with the waves of intensity of hot plasma, the sudden vast jump in temperature will often cause objects to shatter, explode or disintegrate and an observer might therefore wrongly think that the object had been struck by a concussive force.  Should Havok direct his energy at the lowest level, he can project it towards a human being and his target will suffer a severe headache, but will not burn up.  He can absorb cosmic energies from his environment (such as starlight, x-rays, and gamma radiation) and store them within his body cells, metabolizing the energy in order to generate plasma wave discharges that super-heat and disintegrate objects or create concussion bursts by violently displacing air molecules in his path. His absorption is normally passive, but he has shown that he can actively drain and absorb energy as well.

Havok's body is constantly in the process of absorbing cosmic radiation.  When each of his body's power-storage cell enclaves reaches its capacity, excess energy is thereafter absorbed and immediately re-emitted in negligible quantities. The circle on his chest is an indicator as how much energy he has left.  Upon the total expenditure of all his available energy, it takes Havok's body about 16.5 hours to recharge to its peak level.  The act of concentration involved in releasing his energy in anything other than an omnidirectional wave is physically exhausting for Havok if he continues it over an extended period of time.

Havok possesses the normal human strength of a man his age, height and build who engages in intensive regular exercise.  Havok is also well-educated in the field of [[geophysics|geophysical science]] and has been trained in [[martial arts]] by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  

It was also revealed, in the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' and ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' books that his body and mind were a nexus for all other Alex Summers in every other reality, and therefore his very existence was a sort of 'back door' to the others.  This revelation caused the problem in the ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''Exiles'' crossover.  Not much more is known about his multidimensional status and has yet to be explored further.

==Other versions==
===Mys-Tech Wars===
In the four issue series ''[[Mys-Tech]] Wars'' an alternate universe version of Havok, along with the rest of X-Factor, appear in order to assist the mainstream heroes in their battles. An enemy's energy bolt pierces Havok through the neck, killing him instantly.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In this continuity, Alex and his brother Scott are not separated after the plane crash, but adopted together by Sinister. Raised together as the cream of the new mutant aristocracy in Apocalypse's America, the brothers, under the rank of Prelate, work to oversee their foster father's interests. Alex, being the more emotional, and thus unstable, of the two, loses ground in Sinister's eyes and watches with envy as his brother gains favor.

The two brothers reunite briefly with their real father, Christopher Summers, who has been kept in Sinister's medical labs. They discover that Christopher been infected by the Brood and was transforming into the new Brood Queen, forcing Scott to kill him. Alex refuses to believe that there were no other options and blames his brother for their father's death.

Alex meets Lorna once, but they have no relationship other than that of jail warden and prisoner.
The power-hungry Alex is arrogant of his powers both as a mutant and as a Prelate. He frequents the club which Angel owns, Heaven, and has an affair with the club's diva, a flatscan (or human) woman named Scarlett. Because of the antagonism between humans and mutants, they both must keep this affair a secret. Scarlett, it turns out, is a spy working for the Human High Council. Scarlett is arrested right after she discovers that she is pregnant with Alex's child.

At almost that moment, Alex has just recaptured Jean Grey to use against his brother, Scott. Indeed, when Jean was originally a prisoner, she had captivated Scott and inspired him to release other prisoners. Alex exposes his brother as a traitor by asking Scott to execute Jean Grey, which of course Scott refuses to do. Following this, Alex has Scott arrested and gives him over to the Dark Beast for experiments, however, Jean Grey and Scott escape. Alex tracks them down and kills them both, but this decision proves fatal for Alex when [[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]] takes vengeance on Jean's behalf.

===Ultimate Havok===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity of ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', Alex Summers, aka Havok, is the headstrong, brash field leader of the [[Academy of Tomorrow]], the mutant peacekeeping squad of [[Emma Frost]].  In this incarnation, he is the boyfriend and teammate of [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]].

In this incarnation, he also is the brother of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].  As in the mainstream comics, their powers are useless on each other.  However, there are several key differences: first, Alex is the older brother; second, in this world, Alex and Scott are frequently at odds with each other, both ideologically and physically; and third, neither seems interested in mending this rift.  Ideologically, their rift was evidenced by Alex's affiliation with Emma Frost's Academy of Tomorrow. There is also more than one reference to their physical competition over Polaris. In one case, Alex even knocked out Scott with a wrench, though he states that this was because Scott let him.  The two have shown to help each other in great danger, but in general, they have a lot of sibling issues separating them.

===X-Men: The End===
Alex is seen in a sound relationship between himself and Annie, which was suggested in the alternate future ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', where Carter creates an illusion that he is still a child and Havok and Annie are together. 

==In other media==
===Television===
* Havok guest starred in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' [[X-Men (animated series)|animated series]] episode "Cold Comfort" as a member of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and revealed to be romantically involved with Iceman's ex-girlfriend Lorna Dane (not called [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]).  In the episode X-Factor fights against the [[X-Men]] for a "friendly skirmish," as [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] puts it. It is never clearly stated in the animated series that Cyclops and Havok are indeed long-lost brothers though it is hinted at since they develop an instant rivalry.  To their mutual surprise, the brothers find that neither's powers affect the other, a fact which is also seen in the comics. Also, flashbacks to Scott's past show him alongside Alex, and images of Bishop's future show Cyclops and Havok fighting side by side against Sentinels. Interestingly Havok's voice actor also remains uncredited and some fans have speculated that [[Norm Spencer]], the voice actor for Cyclops also played Havok.
* Havok also appeared in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Matt Hill]]. In the series, he was adopted by the Masters family rather than the Blanding family as in the comics and was portrayed as a stereotypical long haired surfer--even with the stereotypical surfer accent and vernacular. Though, like in the comics, he was separated from his brother after escaping the plane they were in that was about to crash. Unlike the other X-Men animated series, however, in X-Men Evolution, Scott and Alex actually do develop a bond between each other though even with this Alex still declined full-time membership in the X-Men to pursue a career as a professional surfer although it may have had more to do with him not fully accepting his powers. In the series, he first appeared in the two part Season 1 finale, ''The Cauldron'', and like his brother and other mutants, his mutant powers were fully evolved, as Magneto put it, by the [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak|Gem of Cyttorak]], which, in the series, had slightly different origins & abilities than in the comics. As a result, both he and his brother were transformed into adult versions with white hair and mastery over their powers, which, beyond taking away the pain Alex felt because of his own powers, also allowed his brother to open his eyes without the need for protective glasses. It was in this same episode that Magneto gave him the codename Havok as one of his Acolytes, though this was a brief position as he realized, as did his brother, that Magneto was using them to achieve his goals. As the result, both of them assisted X-Men in his defeat and the destruction of Asteroid M. Afterward, like many mutants effected by the Gem of Cyttorak, the effects wore off, bringing Alex and his brother back to normal--returning both their pains caused by their powers. Beyond his first appearance in the series, Havok only appears significantly in one other episode and briefly in four others, the last two of which were the two part series finale where he aided in the defeat of Apocalypse and his Horsemen.

===Video Games===
* Havok appeared as a main playable character in ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy 2]]'' for the [[Sony PlayStation]]
* Havok appeared as a playable character in ''[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]'' for the [[Sony PlayStation 2]].
* Havok appeared as a playable character in ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]'' for the PC.
* Havok appeared as a supporting non-playable character in [[Wolverine (video game)|''Wolverine'' video game]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]
* Havok appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' voiced by [[Matt Nolan]].
* [[Scott Holst]] voices Havok who is again an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.

== Canon facts ==
{{Trivia|date=December 2007}}
*Alex has stated his favorite movie is [[West Side Story]], and he is fond of [[Stephen King]] books.

*Alex is allergic to [[tomatoes]].

*It's been established that in 616 canon, Alex is six years younger than his brother Scott, placing him in his early 20's, most likely around 22, as Scott has been estimated at 28. Due to Marvel's [[sliding timescale]] for character ages, this is, of course, subject to change as the writers see fit.  It also seems young as it has been a long time since Alex received his college degree and he would have been around 22 when completing school.

Oddly, in Ultimate Canon, Alex is at least two years older than Scott, despite a confusing mistake by writers that had Bobby Drake calling Alex, Scott's baby brother. Editors glossed over this fact by saying that Bobby was just "confused."

*Alex is immune to his brother's optic blasts, just as Scott is immune to Alex's plasma blasts. But neither of them is immune to their younger brother's, Gabriel Summers a.k.a Vulcan, powers.
