'''Havok''' ('''Alexander "Alex" Summers''') is a fictional character, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}} and member of the [[X-Men]]. He first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' No. 54 (March 1969), and was created by [[Arnold Drake]], [[Don Heck]], and [[Neal Adams]]. Havok generates powerful “plasma blasts”, an ability he has had difficulty controlling. He is the son of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], the younger brother of the X-Men's [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], and the older brother of [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. He often resents Cyclops' authoritarian attitude and reputation as a model X-Man.

In contrast, Havok and his longtime [[Romantic interest|love interest]] [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] have had a love/hate relationship with the team, often finding themselves roped into it. Both were also members of the 1990s-era [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]-sponsored mutant team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. After X-Factor disbanded, Havok starred in ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]],'' a series in which he explored a strange [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]. He has since returned to the X-Men, later taking over his father's role as leader of the [[Starjammers]] to bring Vulcan's reign over the [[Shi'ar]] to an end.

[[Lucas Till]] played Havok, as a member of the X-Men, in 2011's superhero film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. Till returned as Havok in the 2014 film,'' [[X-Men: Days of Future Past]].''

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
Alexander Summers was born in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. He is the second of the three [[Third Summers brother|known]] sons of [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher Summers]], a [[United States Air Force]] Major and test pilot and his wife Katherine Anne. When Alex was a boy growing up in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], Alaska, United States, his father took the family for a flight in their airplane, which came under attack by a [[Shi'ar]] spaceship. As the plane caught fire and was crashing, his parents fastened Alex and Scott into a parachute and pushed them off the plane in hopes that they would survive. His brother hit his head, and was in a coma for a short while.

The Summers boys were recovered and put into an orphanage and Alex was soon adopted though Scott remained there for much of his childhood. Alex was raised by the Blandings whose son, Todd, had died in a car accident.<ref>''X-Factor'' #-1</ref> They tried to make Alex fit into the image of their son, and he tried to do as best he could. When the boy responsible for Todd's death kidnapped Alex and his foster sister, Haley, Alex manifested his powers for the first time, incinerating the boy. [[Mister Sinister]], an evil geneticist who was obsessed with the Summers bloodline, appeared eager yet surprised that Alex's potential exceeded Scott's – despite the fact that he seemed to lack control over his gift. Sinister placed psi-blocks on both Alex and Haley's minds, causing them to forget what had happened that night.

===First encounter with X-Men===
Alex went on to study and earn a degree in [[geophysics]] at college. There he first met the original [[X-Men]], and learned that [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] is his brother. His mutant powers became apparent when he was kidnapped by the [[Living Monolith|Living Pharaoh]], who declared Alex the only being able to rival his power. The two shared the same cosmic energy-absorption abilities, in reverse proportion to each other. By locking Alex in a shielded cell, the Pharaoh was able to absorb enough cosmic energy to become the Living Monolith. The X-Men fought a losing battle against the virtually unstoppable Monolith, until Alex managed to free himself, and the Monolith turned back into the Living Pharaoh.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #54–56</ref>

Alex's mutant power at first seemed to manifest itself only when he was near death. He was unable to control it, and feared its immense power.

Alex was later captured by [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]] and his [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]], who were bent on controlling or eradicating all mutants. Trask fashioned a costume for Alex that would help him control his powers and Alex was given the code name '''Havok'''. Trask turned out to be a mutant himself and the Sentinels were defeated by the X-Men. Havok lost control of his powers, however, and his excess energy was absorbed by [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]]. Havok then gained control of his powers.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #57–60</ref>

Havok actively joined the X-Men team, and began a relationship with Lorna Dane/[[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], much to the anger of [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] who was romantically interested in her as well. While the senior X-Men were in the Savage Land, Havok and Polaris were approached by [[Professor X]] about the imminent invasion of the alien Z’Nox. During this time, the couple fell in love.

With the original X-Men, Havok and Polaris were captured by [[Krakoa]] the living island, but were rescued by the new X-Men.<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1</ref> Havok and Polaris then quit the team's active membership along with most of the original members.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #94</ref>

Havok was again captured by the Living Pharaoh, and was this time rescued by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #69–70</ref>

Havok and Polaris were occasional members and allies of the X-Men for years. They alternated between doing graduate work and earning a postgraduate degree in the American Southwest – where they occasionally encountered the Hulk – and helping out [[Moira MacTaggert]] at her facility for genetic research on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of Scotland. It was during their stay on Muir Island that Havok helped the X-Men battle [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #125–128</ref>

Eventually, Alex learned that [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] of the [[Starjammers]] was really his father.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #158</ref>

During one of their adventures, Polaris was possessed by the mutant [[Marauders (comics)|Marauder]] [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], ending the romantic relationship for a time. Havok then sought out and rejoined the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #219</ref>

===Wolverine and the X-Men===
During this period, Havok became involved with [[Madelyne Pryor]]. Both of them had been rejected by their previous lovers: Pryor's then-husband Cyclops had left her for Jean Grey. Madelyne was manipulated by [[N'astirh]] and became the Goblin Queen. She attempted to use Havok to help take over the world and transform it into a demonic realm. Havok eventually came to his senses and Madelyne killed herself after discovering she was a clone of Jean Grey.

Havok befriended [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and others, then they shared adventures. While they were vacationing in Mexico, they were targeted by a terrorist cell. They defeated the cell, but were fooled by a damsel in distress who was actually a member of the terrorist group. Havok woke up in a hospital, in the care of nurse Scarlett McKenzie, the assassin without disguise. She manipulated Havok and made him fall in love with her. Scarlett was working for the Russian terrorists, Dr. Neutron and Meltdown. Having previously failed to charge up Meltdown's superpowers with the energy released from Chernobyl nuclear disaster, they wanted to use Havok as a conduit to channel the energy of an atomic reactor into Meltdown. Scarlett fed Havok with false information that terrorists were trying to sabotage a nuclear power station. When he ventured into the heart of the reactor, he found it reaching critical limit. According to plan, Havok tried to absorb the dangerous radiation; however, when he witnessed Meltdown killing Scarlett, he unleashed the energy into Meltdown bringing him up to full power. Wolverine arrived and prevented a full disaster by battling with Meltdown, while Havok continued to absorb energy from the reactor, still on the verge of explosion. Wolverine killed Meltdown by penetrating his body with multiple control rods that slowed down the nuclear reactions raging within him, and Havok redirected the nuclear radiation into space.<ref>''Havok & Wolverine: Meltdown'' #1–4</ref>

Around this time, Havok rescued Leila O'Toole from the Trackers. With Wolverine, he discovered that Leila was actually [[Plasma (comics)|Plasma]], the Living Pharaoh's niece. Havok defeated Plasma and the Trackers.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #24–31</ref>

===Genosha===
Havok ultimately went through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] with several other X-Men fleeing the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], the cyborg hunters.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Chris Claremont|penciller=Marc Silvestri|story=Fever Dream|title=Uncanny X-Men|issue=251|date=early November 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Havok ended up an amnesiac in [[Genosha]], a country that used mutants and genetically-engineered slaves called Mutates. He became a high-ranking Magistrate in the Genoshan army. His fellow X-Men had no idea what had happened to him until, during the ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'', the Genoshan government kidnapped members of the mutant teams X-Men, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the [[New Mutants]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Chris Claremont|penciller=Jim Lee|story=The X-Tinction Agenda: First Strike|title=Uncanny X-Men|issue=270|date=November 1990|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> During a pitched battle with Cyclops, Havok's memory returned, but he kept it a secret hoping to catch the Genoshan leader, [[Cameron Hodge]], off guard.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Louise Simonson|penciller=Jon Bogdanove|story=Brotherhood|title=X-Factor|issue=60|date=November 1990|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> He succeeded and delivered the killing blow to Hodge, yet he and Wolfsbane decided to remain in Genosha, as they wanted to help in rebuilding the once proud nation.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Louise Simonson|penciller=Jon Bogdanove|story=Capital Punishment|title=X-Factor|issue=62|date=January 1991|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

===X-Factor===
Havok and Wolfsbane however were soon brought back from Genosha by Professor X and Cyclops as they wanted him to became the leader of the new government-sponsored X-Factor.{{Issue|date=December 2011}} He reunited with Polaris and Havok led the team effectively for quite some time. He dealt with the unwilling, unwitting affections of Wolfsbane, the physical problems of [[Strong Guy]] and various public relations disasters, such as the destruction of the Washington Monument.{{Issue|date=December 2011}} Much of the team's bad image was orchestrated by [[Mister Sinister]], his [[Nasty Boys]] and a mutant senator who could cause bad luck.{{Issue|date=December 2011}} He dealt physically with [[Random (comics)|Random]] and personally, as they clashed for various reasons.{{Issue|date=December 2011}} He grew in new directions as a leader, once seemingly drinking poison in an effort to buck up the spirits of Strong Guy, who had been poisoned. (What Alex drank had been water).{{Issue|date=December 2011}}

Havok and X-Factor were called on to subvert a civil war aggravated by the Pantheon. In this instance, Alex physically challenged the Hulk. He soaked up the various energies that fuel Hulk and used them to bolster his plasma blasts, thereby gaining an advantage. It was the second time Havok had beaten the Hulk.<ref>the first time Alex beat Hulk was in ''Incredible Hulk'' #150</ref>

During this time, Havok's team participated in the events of the [[Infinity War]] and the [[Infinity Crusade]]. Alex and Strong Guy participated the most in far reaching, reality altering cosmic battles.

[[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] had contracted the Legacy Virus in Genosha and later chose to undergo a seemingly mystical healing effort.<ref>''X-Factor'' #100</ref> Despite the procedure's previous success with Wolfsbane, curing her of her unnatural love for Alex, Multiple Man perished.<ref>''X-Factor'' #101</ref> This hit Havok hard, as he felt responsible since Madrox was under his command. He left the team for Hawaii, where he and Polaris enjoyed a romantic honeymoon until Malice, Mr. Sinister and The Nasty Boys showed up.<ref>''X-Factor'' #103</ref> Reinforcements helped Havok and Polaris survive the villains.<ref>''X-Factor'' #105</ref> Shortly afterward, Strong Guy suffered a heart attack and ended up in stasis,<ref>''X-Factor'' #112</ref> and Wolfsbane left to be with her foster mother.<ref>''Excalibur'' (1st series) #90</ref>

After the [[Age of Apocalypse]] event, Havok accidentally destroyed a dam and was forced back into his old containment suit. After new members Wild Child, Shard and Mystique were introduced to the team, Havok fought Random and was captured by the [[Dark Beast]]. He was brainwashed into serving Dark Beast and Onslaught. He broke free of the brainwashing, but used it as an opportunity to infiltrate the enemy and recreated a version of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. He succeeded in defeating Dark Beast and attempted to mend fences with his former X-Factor teammates, specifically Polaris and Multiple Man (the man who had died had been a Madrox duplicate).

While Havok was attempting to reform X-Factor, one of his time-traveling team members, [[Greystone (comics)|Greystone]], created an experimental time travel device to return him to the future. It exploded in mid-air, seemingly killing Havok and Greystone in front of their teammates.

===Mutant X===
{{Main|Mutant X (comics)}}
[[Image:Thesix.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mutant X]]
In actuality, Havok was cast into a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] where he was the leader of a drastically altered version of X-Factor, known as The Six.{{issue|date=July 2014}} In this world, he was the leader of the original X-Men, since his brother Cyclops was abducted by the [[Shi'ar]] along with his parents. He found he was married to Madelyne Pryor, with whom he had a son named Scotty, and all his friends were twisted versions of the ones he knew. Despite being unfamiliar with this realm, Havok willingly took over the role of father for Scotty, though the boy knew he was not really his dad.{{issue|date=July 2014}} Havok becomes leader of The Six and his adventures in this reality lead to a disaster which leaves most of the superhumans dead. Havok is able to save the world itself before being cast into black nothingness.{{issue|date=July 2014}}

===Resurrection===
However, Havok was found back in the original reality in a coma. The X-Men were able to restore his psyche with the help of the son of Havok's nurse, [[Annie Ghazikhanian]]. When he was reunited with Polaris, she asked him to marry her, to which he did not respond. [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] immediately congratulated them, and Havok said nothing further. Likely he felt he ''should'' want to marry Lorna, but did not love her as he had before. Unknown to Havok, Polaris, and Annie, Carter had used his telepathy to link Annie and Alex's dreams while Alex was comatose. In their dreams Havok and Annie fell in love, unknown to Alex but not Annie. Before his wedding Scott tested Alex's resolve by hiring a shapeshifter to morph into Annie, something that disturbed Alex very deeply. The night before the wedding, Alex had a dream convincing him that he now loved Annie. During the wedding Alex stopped the proceedings and called off the marriage. Lorna, already affected by the incident at [[Genosha]], tried to kill Annie and Carter, only to be stopped by Juggernaut and Havok.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}

Alex revealed to Annie that it was Carter who linked the two due to their loneliness and that Alex loved her. Despite the fact that Iceman had started a relationship with Annie, he expressed his feelings for Lorna.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}

Havok and Annie's relationship continued until an impending attack on the X-Mansion at the hands of a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] led by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. This caused Annie to leave Havok and take her son away from the X-Men feeling it was no longer safe for the two to live at the mansion. She wanted Alex to come with them, but his duty was to his team, so mother and son left for parts unknown.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}

===Decimation===
With Annie and Carter now gone, Havok's mind seems to be mending, since he expressed feelings to resume his relationship with Polaris, who moved on after being rejected and was dating her former boyfriend Iceman. During the post-"House of M" storyline, many mutants lost their powers. When Polaris revealed that she had lost her powers, she left the X-Men, and Havok decided to leave with her. However, after he and Polaris encountered the creature called "[[Doop (comics)#Doop and Daap|Daap]]," during which Lorna was abducted, Havok returned to the X-Mansion to see a Sphinx bearing the face of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

He then returned to active duty to bring down Apocalypse with the remainder of his squad, composed of Rogue, Iceman, and new member Mystique. Havok single-handedly destroyed the antidote to Apocalypse's meta-plague, which had been a key element in his plan to decimate the human population. [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] was turned into a horseman and clashed with Havok and the other X-Men. During the last battle, Iceman struck down [[Polaris (comics)|Pestilence]], who was revealed to be Polaris. As her esophagus closed down, Havok administered CPR to save her life, but was infected with the meta-plague. Luckily, Emma Frost had saved some of the antidote Havok destroyed earlier and cured him with it.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

===The Rise and Fall of The Shi'ar Empire===
Havok was recruited by [[Professor X]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #475</ref> along with Marvel Girl ([[Rachel Summers]]), [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]] and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] to participate in a space mission to stop [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] from unleashing his powers on the [[Shi'ar]] empire. Havok has recently been reunited with [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], his father, and brought him news about Vulcan. His current relationship with Polaris is still developing. Polaris seems to finally show concrete signs of forgiving Havok, telling him to "just shut up and kiss" her after the team won their first battle against the entire regiment of Shi'ar soldiers in their beginning struggle against [[D'Ken]] and in support of [[Lilandra]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #484</ref> Although Havok initially rebuffs her advances, hesitant to "start up again after" everything that happened between them, Lorna says that he needs to "blow off some steam" and the scene ends with them kissing. During the final battle,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #486</ref> Corsair tries to reason with his son Vulcan but Vulcan kills his father where he stands. Havok, enraged by this, launches an attack at his brother with intention of killing him, but is easily defeated. In the end, Nightcrawler, Warpath, and Hepzibah get the injured Professor X and Darwin back to the ship, but Lilandra sends the ship back to Earth, leaving Havok and his teammates stranded.

Havok along with Polaris, Rachel, [[Korvus]], Ch'od, and Raza form a new team of Starjammers after the death of Corsair, dedicated to defeating Vulcan and restoring Lilandra to the throne.<ref>''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan''</ref>

===Starjammers===
The civil war between Vulcan's forces and those loyal to the dethroned Lilandra rages on. Led by Havok and the Starjammers, Lilandra's forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan's forces, which are plagued by defections. The Shi`ar, contrary to Vulcan's expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him.

Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather's Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the ''Hammer'', is destroyed by the Scy`ar Tal (translates as "Death to the Shi'ar"). Vulcan and Gladiator attack the leader of the Scy'ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi'ar space.

Marvel Girl makes contact with the Eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the M'Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi`ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M`Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra & K`ythri. The M'Kraan then changed their named to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi`ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.

Under the ceasefire, the Shi'ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy'ar's biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan are in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy'ar tries to stop them. Once Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered, he severs the connection Eldest has with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection is severed, the Scy'ar become unorganized, and the tide of the battle shifts to the Shi`ar. The Shi'ar then proceed to attack both the Scy'ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun.

Vulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy'ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returns and, having absorbed enough power to burn Vulcan, decides to end things with him. While they battle, Rachel and Korvus try, and fail, to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard end Alex's battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroys Finality. Alex and the Starjammers are then taken into Vulcan's custody and placed in a prison, while Rachel Summers remains free.

===Divided We Stand===
Alex and Lorna along with the other captured Starjammers are kept in a deep underwater prison {{convert|20|mi|km}} below a planet's surface. Alex and Lorna are tortured daily and forced to hear each other's screams, and Alex is powerless as he's nowhere near a star to draw his powers from. Vulcan informs Havok of the events of Messiah Complex and that the baby is gone, Charles Xavier is dead and the X-Men are no more (not knowing the full truth of the result). Alex laughs off Vulcan, seeing the baby as a beacon of hope.

===''X-Men: Kingbreaker'' and ''War of Kings''===
Despite ploys such as telling Havok that his teammates are dead and it was all Alex's fault, Havok remains defiant. Alex Summers was last seen displaying energy coming from his left hand proving that he had at least some power left.<ref>X-Men: King Breaker #1</ref>

Havok allowed some time to go by, allegedly with these moments of exposure continuing, before making his move. Waiting until it was his meal time, as the guards slid the food through the door, he blasted it open, warning the guards to run. When they instead attacked, he mercilessly defeated them, killing both. Alex then raced into the depths of the Complex searching for his teammates.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

He had no problem locating the cells of his crew and liberating them from captivity. He then went in search of Lorna, defeating more guards along the way. Alex, with Raza and Ch'od in tow made it to Lorna's lab where Alex set her free. After receiving a thank-you kiss upon waking her, Havok surprised his team as he informed them of his true plan. Instead of running they would wait, Gabriel would be coming to them to defeat them, and Havok planned to kill him when he did.<ref>''X-Men: King Breaker'' #3</ref>

===Realm of Kings===
Due to the incident of Rachel and [[Korvus]] both losing the connection to the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]; Havok, Polaris, Rachel and Korvus have departed for Earth.<ref>''Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard'' #2</ref> According to Rachel, they are still "half a universe away" from Earth.{{Issue|date=May 2011}} Havok, Polaris, and Rachel return in ''[[X-Men Legacy]]'' #254, in which Rogue launches a rescue mission after Rachel sends a telepathic distress signal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15874/x-men_legacy_search_rescue |title=X-Men Legacy: Search & Rescue &#124; X-Men |publisher=Marvel |date=May 12, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

===Regenesis===
Havok along with Polaris are seen joining Wolverine's side due to Polaris wanting to keep herself away from her father Magneto.<ref>''X-Men: Regenesis'', 2011</ref>  Shortly after they arrived back on Earth,<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #259</ref><ref>''X-Factor'' #234 (June 2012)</ref> the duo is encouraged by Wolverine to lead X-Factor Investigations after Jamie Madrox's death.<ref>''X-Factor'' #230 (March 2012)</ref>  Jamie returns to life shortly after, but Havok remains with X-Factor for a while.

===Uncanny Avengers===
He is asked to lead the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]] by Captain America, Rogers reasoning that the mutant race needs a new 'spokesperson' with Xavier dead and Cyclops imprisoned, although Havok doubts his ability to fulfil such a role.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #1</ref>

The Celestials destroyed Earth and mutants were relocated to 'Planet X' by the machinations of Eimin - one of the children of the Celestial-infected Archangel and the latest Horseman of Pestilence.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #18</ref> Havok married the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and they had a daughter, Katie, but Katie is lost when she is captured by [[Kang the Conqueror]] after he helps the team avert this timeline by projecting their minds back into their past selves.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #20</ref> Although Alex is left disfigured after the battle, he and Janet remain together,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #22</ref> and are contacted by [[Immortus]], who informs them that he can return their daughter to them if they take action at the right time and place to conceive her, but also warns them about the imminent threat posed by the Red Skull.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #23</ref> 

During the events of [[AXIS (comics)|World War Hate]], the Red Skull and Scarlet Witch accidentally morally invert various heroes and villains.{{issue|date=December 2014}} Havok remains corrupted after the other heroes and villains are returned to normal, having been unintentionally 'protected' from the reversion by a shield generated by [[Iron Man]]- along with [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]- prompting him to join Cyclops's team after using the Wasp as a hostage to escape.<ref>''Axis'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Havok is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] possessing the power to absorb ambient [[cosmic rays|cosmic energy]], process it and emanate it from his body as waves of energy that heat the air in the path, turning it into [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the form of a blast or discharge, with a tell-tale concentric circle pattern. These waves will emanate from his body in all directions unless he purposefully tries to channel them in a single direction, usually along the length of his arms. This results in control over an extremely powerful sort of destructive force. He is immune to the adverse effects of most forms of radiation and heat. In the past, he was not entirely able to control this ability, which made him a danger to those around him unless he wore a special containment suit equipped with special sensors for measuring and controlling his power output. Havok is immune to his own powers and to those of his brother Scott. He is resistant but not immune to Vulcan's powers.

Despite past accounts, the energy that Havok releases is not truly a concussive force. When Havok strikes an object with hot plasma, the sudden temperature jump often causes objects to shatter or disintegrate. Should Havok direct his energy at the lowest level, he can project it towards a human being and his target will suffer a severe headache, but will not burn up. He can absorb cosmic energy from his environment (such as starlight, x-rays, and gamma radiation) and store them in his cells, metabolizing the energy to generate plasma wave discharges that super-heat and disintegrate objects. His absorption is normally passive, but he has shown that he can actively drain and absorb energy as well.

Havok's body is constantly absorbing cosmic radiation. When his body reaches its capacity, excess energy is then immediately re-emitted in negligible quantities. The circle on his chest is an indicator as how much energy he has left. Upon the expenditure of all his available energy, it takes Havok about 17 hours to recharge to peak level. The concentration involved in releasing his energy in focused beams is exhausting for Havok, especially if he does it over an extended period.

Havok has the normal human strength, height, and build of a man who engages in intensive regular exercise. Havok is well-educated in the field of [[geophysics|geophysical science]] where he has earned a masters degree and completed some doctoral work, and he has been trained in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. He is an instinctive tactician and strategist.

It was also revealed, in the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' and ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' books that his body and mind were a nexus for all other Alex Summers in other realities and his very existence is sort of a "back door" to the others. This revelation caused the problem in the ''Uncanny X-Men'' and ''Exiles'' crossover. Not much more is known about his multidimensional status.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] continuity, Alex and his brother Scott are not separated after the plane crash, but adopted together by Sinister. Raised together as the cream of the new mutant aristocracy in Apocalypse's America, the brothers, under the rank of Prelate, work to oversee their foster father's interests. Alex, being the more emotional, and thus unstable, of the two, loses ground in Sinister's eyes and watches with envy as his brother gains favor.<ref>''Factor X'' #01</ref>

The two brothers reunite briefly with their real father, Christopher Summers, who has been kept in Sinister's medical labs.

Alex meets Lorna once, but they have no relationship other than that of jail warden and prisoner.
The power-hungry Alex is arrogant of his powers both as a mutant and as a Prelate. He frequents the club which Angel owns, Heaven, and has an affair with the club's diva, a flatscan (or human) woman named Scarlett (presumably that reality's version of the woman who appeared in the ''Meltdown'' miniseries). Because of the antagonism between humans and mutants, they both must keep this affair a secret. Scarlett, it turns out, is a spy working for the Human High Council. Scarlett is arrested right after she discovers that she is pregnant with Alex's child.<ref>''Factor X'' #04</ref>

At almost that moment, Alex has just recaptured Jean Grey to use against his brother, Scott. Indeed, when Jean was originally a prisoner, she had captivated Scott and inspired him to release other prisoners. Alex exposes his brother as a traitor by asking Scott to execute Jean Grey, which Scott refuses to do. Following this, Alex has Scott arrested and gives him over to the Dark Beast for experiments, however, Jean Grey and Scott escape. Alex tracks them down and knocks his brother and seemingly kills Jean, but this action proves fatal for Alex when [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Age of Apocalypse|Weapon X]] takes vengeance on Jean's behalf.<ref>''X-Men: Omega''</ref>

In this incarnation, he also is the brother of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. As in the mainstream comics, their powers are useless on each other. However, there are several key differences: first, Alex is sometimes called the older brother and other times called the younger brother; second, in this world, Alex and Scott are frequently at odds with each other, both ideologically and physically; and third, neither seems interested in mending this rift. Ideologically, their rift was evidenced by Alex's affiliation with Emma Frost's Academy of Tomorrow.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Havok guest starred in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' [[X-Men (animated series)|animated series]] episode "Cold Comfort". He appears as a member of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and revealed to be romantically involved with Iceman's ex-girlfriend Lorna Dane (not called [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]). In the episode X-Factor fights against the [[X-Men]] for a "friendly skirmish," as [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] puts it. When face-to-face, Cyclops and Havok do not recognize each other, and express genuine surprise that their powers can't affect the other. They form a quick rivalry, however. In the episode "Orphan's End", a flashback shows a young Alex with his brother and parents. In the episode "Days of Future Past, Part 2", during a montage of Bishop's future, Havok is briefly seen fighting Sentinels alongside Cyclops. Havok's voice actor in the episode "Cold Comfort" is uncredited.

* Havok also appeared in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Matt Hill]]. In the series, he was adopted by the Masters family rather than the Blanding family as in the comics and was portrayed as a stereotypical long haired [[surfer]]-even with the stereotypical surfer accent and vernacular. Though, like in the comics, he was separated from his brother after escaping the plane they were in that was about to crash. Unlike the other X-Men animated series, however, in X-Men Evolution, Scott and Alex do develop a bond, though Alex still declined full-time membership in the X-Men to pursue a career as a professional surfer. Alex manifests his powers here as simple red energy blasts rather than as the massively powerful circular power signature from the comics. In the series, he first appeared in the two part Season 1 finale, ''The Cauldron'', and like his brother and other mutants, his mutant powers were fully evolved, as Magneto put it, by the [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak|Gem of Cyttorak]], which, in the series, had slightly different origins & abilities than in the comics. As a result, both he and his brother were transformed into adult versions with white hair and mastery over their powers, which, beyond taking away the pain Alex felt because of his own powers, also allowed his brother to open his eyes without the need for protective glasses. It was in this same episode that Magneto gave him the codename Havok as one of his Acolytes, though this was a brief position as he realized, as did his brother, that Magneto was using them to achieve his goals. As the result, both of them assisted X-Men in his defeat and the destruction of Asteroid M. Afterward, like many mutants affected by the Gem of Cyttorak, the effects wore off, bringing Alex and his brother back to normal—returning both their pains caused by their powers. Beyond his first appearance in the series, Havok only appears significantly in one other episode and briefly in four others, the last two of which were the two part series finale where he aided in the defeat of Apocalypse and his Horsemen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

* Havok is mentioned in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Breakdown". Similar to the comics, Alex and Scott's parents were lost in a plane crash, in which the brothers were the survivors. Scott fell into a coma for two years, while Alex was adopted. He was to be added to the series as a character, however the series was cancelled prior to his appearance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

When Sebastian Shaw invaded their base, Darwin and Alex attempted to defend the others. Shaw absorbed the energy Alex shot at him and then placed it in Darwin's body. Due to the fact that Darwin could not adapt to such raw energy, he ultimately explodes. His guilt for the indirect cause of Darwin's death is what leads him to become an X-Man. Initially having trouble controlling the energy bursts he releases as part of his powers, Alex eventually manages to focus his abilities thanks to equipment developed by Professor X and Hank McCoy.

* Till reprised his role in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''.<ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/MarvelFreshman/news/?a=83286</ref> Alex has left the X-Men to join the U.S. Army in the [[Vietnam War]].
