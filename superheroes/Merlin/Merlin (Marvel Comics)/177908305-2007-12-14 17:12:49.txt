The first Merlin of the Marvel Universe is apparently the figure of [[Arthurian legend]], hailing from 6th century A.D. Britain.  He was a powerful sorcerer who acted as teacher, advisor, and defender of King Arthur Pendragon of Camelot.  Merlin warned King Arthur that his son, [[Mordred (comics)|Modred]] would be responsible for the end of Camelot, but before Arthur could put the baby to death, he was rescued and raised in anonymity.  Merlin was responsible for teaching magic to [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fey]], though she turned against him and became one of King Arthur’s greatest foes.

Knowing that Britain would need a champion to face the likes of Modred and Morgan, he sought a boy to become the first [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]].  He had this boy, Percy, trained in all known forms of combat, and when he grew up, Sir Percy was presented with the [[Ebony Blade]].

Merlin was finally placed in suspended animation within a cave by the sorceress Nimue, but his spirit continued to advise the original Black Knight.

This Merlin’s whereabouts and activities after the fall of Camelot are unknown.

This being was apparently 10,000 years old, and apparently was a savage that came to possess some portion of the same Bloodgem that [[Bloodstone (comics)|Ulysses Bloodstone]] would later possess, which gave him immortality and eternal youth.  He later came to Britain during the time of Camelot, and impersonated the real Merlin while he was away.  The [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] [[Sersi]] exposed the impostor, and the real Merlin placed him in suspended animation.

The false Merlin was revived in modern times, and fought [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].  He later took the name '''Warlock'''<ref>X-Men #30</ref>, and fought the [[X-Men]], and later fought the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] under the name '''Maha Yogi'''<ref>X-Men #47</ref>.  During his encounter with the Hulk, his fragment of the Bloodgem was destroyed and he rapidly aged into helplessness. 

He claimed to be a mutant and had the ability to control the minds of others, create illusions, project force bolts, levitate objects, teleport himself, create force fields and alter his own appearance.

==Dire Wraith==
Another being posing as Merlin was sent by [[Immortus]] to fight the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  This being was revealed to be a shapechaning [[Dire Wraith]] with absolutely no connection to the real Merlin.

==Merlyn==
The being [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]] also claims to be the real Merlin.
