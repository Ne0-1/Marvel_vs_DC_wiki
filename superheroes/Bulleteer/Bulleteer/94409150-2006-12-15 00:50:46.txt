'''Bulleteer''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[DC Comics]] [[superheroine]], a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]].  She was created by [[Grant Morrison]], based on the [[Fawcett Comics]] characters [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl]].
==Origin==
{{spoilers}}
While all 27-year-old Alix Harrower wanted was a relatively normal life, her husband Lance hoped for bigger things.  A research scientist, he had developed a thin metal skin that could bond with [[collagen]], turning tissue indestructibly hard.  When this "smartskin" is applied to a living being (like Lance's initial test subject, a mouse named Metal Mickey, presumably after both the children's TV character and the Disney icon), the subject becomes superhumanly strong.  Though the potential military applications were obvious, Lance dreamed of using it on himself, modeling a superhero career after the WWII superheroes [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl]].  He wanted to be famous, to rub elbows with people like [[Green Lantern]], and most importantly, to use smartskin to keep himself and his wife eternally young.  Unfortunately, after he tested it on himself, he began to suffocate.  When he touched Alix, the smartskin bonded to her.  Rushed to the hospital, she was saved thanks to medics gaining access to bare skin covered by her wedding ring.  Lance was not wearing his, and so died of [[asphyxiation]].  Alix spiralled into [[depression (mood)|depression]] as her new status as a freak forced her to quit her teaching job.  Another emotional blow came at the discovery that her deceased husband's superhero dreams stemmed from a fixation on an internet "superteen" [[Pornographic actor|porn star]] named "Super Sally Sonic."  Distraught, Alix attempted suicide.  While trying to find a structure hard enough to kill her on impact, she came across a burning building, and saved the people still inside.  After those she saved called her a superhero, she decided to live up to the name, taking the alias Lance had hoped to use for himself: Bulleteer.

==Early career==

In ''Bulleteer'' #2, it is revealed that Alix was going to be the seventh member of Greg Saunders' ill-fated new [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]], but got cold feet.  She teams up with Agent Helligan from ''Shining Knight #3'' and interrogates Ramon Solomano, alias "the Iron Hand" (an old enemy of Saunders from his days as the costumed hero [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]), for information on the [[Nebula Man]] and the deaths of the six other soldiers as seen in ''Seven Soldiers of Victory'' #0.

In ''Bulleteer'' #3, Alix serves as a bodyguard to Mermaid Stellamaris, interacting with various secondary Soldiers characters, and eventually surviving an assassination attempt by the apparently undead [[Alias the Spider|Spyder]] (unknown to her, thanks to the intervention of the mysteriously reappeared Vigilante).  Upon her return home, Alix is crushed with a refrigerator by the indestructible Sally Sonic, who was posing as a boarder.

In ''Bulleteer'' #4, Sally Sonic, the woman who coerced Lance into applying the smartskin to himself, gloats over Alix.  Alix manages to successfully triumph over Sally in battle despite a broken arm, only to be again approached by an apparently undead Greg Saunders afterwards.  He attempts to recruit her to 'save the world', but she rejects him again.

In ''Seven Soldiers'' #1, Alix tried to bring Sally to the hospital when the Sheeda began to launch an invasion on Manhattan. After Sally woke up, she tried to kill Alix yet again, until the car collided with the fallen [[Sheeda]] queen, Gloriana Tenebrae, and burst into flames. Alix survived, but Sally and Gloriana didn't.

It was revealed that Alix was '''The Spear that Was Never Thrown''', the ultimate downfall of the Sheeda race. This Spear was thrown by [[Aurakles]], the very first superhero from 42,000 years ago, and Alix's ancestor. Aurakles appeared as an imprisoned demi-god in the pages of [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Mister Miracle]].

== Later career ==
Alix appeared in ''Infinite Crisis #7'' as one of the heroes fighting against the rampaging villains in Metropolis and was later seen in the two-page line up of the heroes of the DCU. She is appearing in 52 #24, as a member of an interim JLA, also featuring [[Firestorm]], [[Firehawk]], [[Super-Chief]], and [[Ambush Bug]].
