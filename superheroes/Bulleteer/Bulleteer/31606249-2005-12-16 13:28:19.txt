While all 27-year-old Alix Harrower wanted was a relatively normal life, her husband Lance hoped for bigger things. A research scientist, he had developed a thin metal skin that could bond with collagen, turning tissue indestructibly hard. When this "smartskin" is applied to a living being, (like Lance's initial test subject, a mouse named Metal Mickey) the subject becomes superhumanly strong. Though the potential military applications were obvious, Lance dreamed of using it on himself, modeling a superhero career after the WWII superheroes [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl]]. He wanted to be famous, to rub elbows with people like [[Green Lantern]], and most importantly, to use smartskin to keep himself and his wife eternally young. Unfortunately, after he tested it on himself, he began to suffocate. When he touched Alix, the smartskin bonded to her with no ill-effects, while he slowly died from asphyxiation. Alix spiraled into [[depression]] as her new status as a freak forced her to quit her teaching job. Another emotional blow came at the discovery that her deceased husband's superhero dreams stemmed from a fixation on an internet "superteen" pornstar named "Super Sally Sonic." Distraught, Alix attempted suicide. While trying to find a structure hard enough to kill her on impact, she came across a burning building, and saved the people still inside. After those she saved called her a superhero, she decided to live up to the name, taking the alias Lance had hoped to use for himself: Bulleteer.

According to advance notices, she will soon be taking a job for the Coast City Chronicle, leading up to the events in Seven Soldiers Special #0
