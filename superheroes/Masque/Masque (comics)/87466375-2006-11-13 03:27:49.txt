'''Masque''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Masque first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #169. Masque was originally a prominent member of the sewer-dwelling community of [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] outcasts called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], lead by [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]].

==History==
Masque was one of the few Morlocks to escape the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] in the [[Mutant Massacre]], and after the slaughter of most of her brethren, Callisto traveled to [[Moira McTaggart|Moira McTaggart's]] hospital on [[Muir Isle|Muir Island]], to remain with the few surviving Morlocks. When Callisto returned to New York to seal off the tunnels of the [[X-Mansion]] connecting to the Morlock tunnels, she was kidnapped by new Morlocks, now under Masque's leadership.  Masque gave Callisto a pretty new face of a top supermodel, which inadvertently lured [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (who had just resurfaced with [[amnesia]], after having travelled through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]), into the clutches of Masque's Morlocks after he fell in love with her.

Masque teamed the Morlocks with [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], but in one of their first battles against [[X-Force]], led by [[Nathan Summers]], Masque was killed by [[Shatterstar]]. 

Recently, Masque returned, with the ability to manipulate her own flesh, as a beautiful woman. Masque ruled an underground cadre of mutant gladiators that fought for fame and the right to control defeated fellow warriors in combat. Here, she used her powers to manipulate Callisto, giving her octopus like arms, and [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] into becoming the greatest gladiator. Callisto and Storm eventually rebelled and defeated Masque yet again. Masque retained her mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers==
Masque possesses the ability to change the physical appearance of any other person by touch, and originally couldn't use it to alter her own hideous appearance. This caused her to often manipulate others' bodies to make them as disfigured as her own. When the Morlocks formed, Masque was used to make several members ugly, thus ensuring their loyalty. 

==Masque's gender==
The way Masque was drawn and portrayed in issues of [[Uncanny X-Men]] from the late 1980s and early 1990s might lead one to the conclusion that Masque is male. In 1990, [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] also asked the following question in [[New Mutants]] #91:

<center>''"Excuse colloquial slang usage, selfmentor [[Cable (comics)|Cable sir]], but was not entity Masque a bit out of his gourd?"</center>

On top of the quote, it can be assumed from The Arena arc in X-Treme X-Men that Masque prefers to shift appearances, taking on the likeness of others from photographs. Perhaps the female form was merely the "flavor of the week."
