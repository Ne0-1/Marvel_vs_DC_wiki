:''For the comic book character Masque who was briefly a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], see [[Madame Masque]].''

'''Masque''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Masque first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #169. Masque was originally a prominent member of the sewer-dwelling community of [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] outcasts called the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].

Masque possessed the ability to change the physical appearance of any other person, but could not use it to alter her own hideous appearance. This caused her to often manipulate others' bodies to make them as disfigured as her own. When the Morlocks formed, Masque was used to make several of the members ugly, thus ensuring their loyalty. After many Morlocks were killed by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] in the [[Mutant Massacre]], the Morlocks' leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] departed and became amnesiac, and Masque took up leadership of the remaining Morlocks. Later, Masque turned Callisto, who at the time had no memory of being a Morlock and was living a happy life with an equally amnesiac [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], from a beautiful model into a mutant with arms reformed into tentacles. Masque teamed the Morlocks with [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], only to apparently be killed by [[X-Force]]. Masque eventually returned, now with the appearance of a beautiful woman, and fought [[Storm (comics)|Storm]].
