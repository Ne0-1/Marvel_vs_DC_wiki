Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] noted, "Amazo was a persistent thorn in the JLA's side... although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest... His very existence is a hazard to all of humanity."<ref>{{Cite book | last=Conroy | first=Mike | authorlink=Mike Conroy (writer) | title=500 Comic Book Villains | publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]] | date=October 2004 | isbn=978-0-7641-2908-7}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The [[android (robot)|android]] Amazo was created by scientist [[Professor Ivo]], who became obsessed with [[immortality]]. The original Justice League of America ([[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Aquaman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and the [[Martian Manhunter]]) discover their powers have been drained and appear to be used in the theft of certain long-lived creatures. Attempting to guard the remainder of the creatures and discover the perpetrator, the League is defeated by Amazo. Ivo reveals he has created a means of extending his life span courtesy of the data obtained from studying the creatures, and almost succeeds in removing the League's memories of their having ever been heroes before being stopped by Green Lantern. The League defeat the android, and store it in their trophy room.

The android is re-activated twice to assist the League in regaining lost abilities<ref>''Justice League of America'' #27 (May 1964)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #111-112 (June – Aug. 1974)</ref> and later by accident when [[red sun]] radiation reaches Earth, although after an extensive battle involving time-travel [[Superman]] defeats the android, preventing his attempted murder of Ivo and the League.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #480-483 (Feb. – May 1978)</ref> Villain the [[Key (comics)|Key]] re-activates the android in a failed bid to restore his own shrunken stature, although, after the League defeat the android, member [[Zatanna]] restores the Key to his former state.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981)</ref>

Ivo reactivates Amazo for use against a weaker version of the League, with the android defeating all the new members until finally stopped by the Martian Manhunter and Aquaman.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August – October 1985)</ref> A different Amazo model is activated and battles the superhero team the [[Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]],<ref>''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #12 (Fall 1993)</ref> and while searching for Ivo encounters the hero Aztek, who reasons with the android.<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref> This version briefly battles the [[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]] before finally being destroyed.<ref>''Resurrection Man'' #2 (June 1997)</ref>

One version of Amazo is pulled from the timestream by a curious [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], who wishes to meet his "ancestor". Amazo responds by attacking Hourman and copying the "Worlogog", an artifact embedded in the android. Amazo then becomes "Timazo" and wreaks havoc with his new-found ability to manipulate time, until hurled back into the timestream as his former self by Hourman.<ref>''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'' #1 (April 1999)</ref> A current version of Amazo has several more encounters with Hourman.<ref>''Hourman'' #5-7 (Aug. – Oct. 1999), #17 (Aug. 2000), #19-21 (Oct. – Dec. 2000)</ref>

Another version, with the ability to absorb the abilities of the League on a conceptual level, overpowers over two dozen heroes, until Atom advises Superman to announce the team is disbanded. The premise that the League no longer exists deprives the android of purpose and it shuts down.<ref>''JLA'' #27 (March 1999)</ref> Batman and [[Nightwing]] discover a partial Amazo (lacking several abilities) in a weapons shipment, and manage to destroy the android by neutralizing its individual abilities before finally destroying it.<ref>''Batman'' #636-637 (March – April 2005)</ref>

Another Amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], but is deactivated when sometime hero [[Black Adam]] decapitates the android.<ref>''Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special'' (June 2006)</ref>

Ivo combines parts of the current Amazo with human [[Ovum|ova]] and [[DNA]] to create the android's "son". Awakened prematurely by an [[earthquake]], the junior version of Amazo believes itself to be a philosophy student called Frank Halloran and dates a girl called Sara. Amazo reveals the truth to his progeny, who attempts to resist his programming by becoming a hero called "Kid Amazo". Slowly becoming insane, Kid Amazo confronts Ivo and discovers Sara is Ivo's daughter and was placed to monitor the android. Batman deduces Kid Amazo has both the powers and the personalities of the JLA, and, during a battle with the League, creates dissension in the team that the android mimics, causing an internal logic error that destroys it.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #37-41 (June – Oct. 2007)</ref>

Ivo secretly downloads Amazo's programming into the body of the Red Tornado, the creation of sometime ally Professor [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]]. Several members of the JLA battle an army of Red Tornado androids, until discovering that Red Tornado's body is intended for the mind of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Although the process is prevented, the Amazo programming asserts itself and attacks the superhero team, with member [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] eventually destroying it.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #1-5 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007)</ref>

A new body is created for the Red Tornado, although the Amazo programming from the first body downloads into the shell. The android battles the JLA until teleported into the [[gravity well]] of the red star [[Antares]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21-23 (July – Sept. 2008)</ref>

===The New 52===
The first storyline takes place five years in the past and details the retconned origin of the original Justice League in ''[[The New 52]]'', a reboot of the DC Comics universe. In an origin story it is revealed that hero [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] was uploaded with Ivo's "A-maze" operating system among other features.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #4 (Feb. 2012)</ref> The League later battle the android.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #8 (June 2012)</ref>

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Amazo appears as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1 (Sept. 2013)</ref>

During the ''[[Amazo Virus]]'' storyline, A nanotech virus infected humans with Amazo's DNA. In the end, the virus took complete control of a host turning him into the new Amazo.

==Powers and abilities==
Amazo is an advanced android capable of duplicating all the physical skills and special abilities of any individual he gets close enough to, whether it be an alien, [[metahumans]], or a non-powered human (such as the strength of [[Superman]], the speed of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], or the deductive abilities of [[Batman]]). The android is apparently able to retain the abilities of any target he copies, enabling him to switch between any of them instantly. However, he is only able to access a single target's skillset at a time. Later versions of the character were also capable of simulating weapons, such as the [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] of [[Green Lantern]] and the Nth metal mace of [[Hawkgirl]].

==Other versions==
===Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew===
''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew]]'' #14-15 featured the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel Earth]] of "Earth-C-Minus", a world populated by [[funny animal]] superheroes that paralleled the mainstream [[DC Universe]]. On Earth-C-Minus a counterpart of the character Amazo existed called "Amazoo": a robotic composite of a dozen different animal body parts and abilities.

===Injustice 2===

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animated====
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' two-part episode "Tabula Rasa", voiced by [[Robert Picardo]]. Here he is depicted being a grey blank like humanoid, only referred to as The Android. Unlike other incarnations, Amazo is able to access any and all abilities replicated simultaneously. Also, while initially obtaining any target's weakness a various character flaws (i.e. Flash's unfocused and flirting nature or Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite respectively), he can eventually adapt away these flaws. Amazo was found by Luthor who was seeking Dr. Ivo after a battle with the League destroyed part of his battle suit. Upon discovering Ivo's death and Amazo's abilities, Luthor uses the android to steal the League's powers and steal parts needed to fix his body. However after absorbing Martin Manhunter's abilities, Amazo learns the truth, becoming a gold form and sets off for space, intent on finding meaning in his life. 
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episodes "The Return" and "Wake the Dead", voiced once again by Robert Picardo. Amazo had obtained godhood, having demonstrated the ability to teleport Oa away, giving the appearance he had destroyed it. His intent was to kill Luthor for using him, going through every member of the Justice League in the process. Ultimately, he gives up his quest for revenge due to the words of Doctor Fate, returning Oa, and is given sanctuary in the Tower of Fate to find his purpose. Amazo returns in Wake the Dead, trying to stop the newly empowered and resurrected Solomon Grundy. However even Amazo's attack do nothing to the zombie, causing him to teleport away to find a solution. Amazo is briefly mentioned during part 3 of the season 2 finale, "Panic in the Sky". Luthor reveals he set up the League so Project Cadmus could destroy them. This distraction would allow Lex to transfer his mind into an Amazo-like body, which he crafted from stolen Cadmus tech. 
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Schooled", voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]]. After replicating the powers of Black Canary, Captain Atom, Flash, Martian Manhunter, Red Tornado, and Superman, the Justice League was able to just barely defeat the android and dismantle it. While transporting the parts to a safe location, Professor Ivo intercepts the trucks and was able to reassemble his android. The Justice League's respective sidekicks, now called The Team, pursued Ivo and Amazo. Thanks to a timely aid by Artemis, the Team was able to exploit Amazo's inability to use more than one target's replicated powers at a time and cause it to explode.
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Triumvirate of Terror", voiced by [[Roger Rose]].
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode "Boo-ray for Bizarro", voiced by [[Thomas Lennon]]. In addition to replicating a target's skills, powers, and personal tools, he is also able to replicate mental prowess of an individual, as he obtained Batman's keen intuition. He arrives at the Justice League Watchtower with the intent to replicate the powers of every member in the Justice League and capture them before taking over the world. Amazo does make a reference to Professor Ivo who is dead. While capturing Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman, he sends out a distress signal for all other League members to return to base. Before his trap can be sprung, [[Bizarro]] arrives. Wanting to join the League, Bizarro decides to help stop Amazo by bringing who he claims is the "Smartest Man in the Galaxy", which turns out to be [[Space Cabbie]]. As Amazo fights Bizarro while replicating his powers, the clone's backwards mentality conflicts with Amazo processing, ultimately overloading and destroy him.

====Live-action====
* In ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', Dr. Ivo inhabited a ship called the ''Amazo'' where he tested experiments and tortured his captives.

===Film===
* Amazo appears in ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. In the story, Batman describes Amazo as an android "with the ability to absorb the powers of metahumans". However, Amazo does not display any powers other than super-strength, flight and heat vision, implying that it has at least absorbed [[Superman]]'s abilities. It has the same [[pressure points]] as a human being, is damaged by Batman's micro-bombs and its head is destroyed by [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] charges.

===Video games===
* Amazo appears in ''[[Justice League: Chronicles]]''.
