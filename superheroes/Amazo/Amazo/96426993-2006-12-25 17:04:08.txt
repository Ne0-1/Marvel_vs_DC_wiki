'''Amazo''' is a fictional [[android]] from [[DC Comics]].  He has fought the [[Justice League of America]] on several occasions.

==Fictional character biography==
Amazo was built by the insane super-scientist [[Professor Ivo]] to battle the [[Justice League of America]]. Ivo wished to demonstrate his ingenuity while ridding the world of its premier [[superhero]] team.  Amazo was originally built to imitate the powers of the original JLA members: [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Barry Allen|The Flash]], the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Aquaman]]. However, the lineup of the JLA's founding roster has been changed via [[retcon]]s, and it is currently uncertain how this changes Amazo's origin. Later versions of the robot appeared with differing abilities depending on which heroes he battled and later versions were able to evolve abilities simply by encountering heroes.  One version was able to mimic the powers of any current JLA member, and to add new powers as new members appeared.  This version was beaten when Superman officially disbanded the team; with no JLA to mimic, Amazo was rendered powerless.

Amazo, in the guise of ''Timazo'', became the chief enemy of the [[android]] [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]] when he was able to duplicate half of Hourman's near-infinite temporal manipulation abilities.  Timazo likely also possessed the powers of [[Aquaman]], [[Black Canary]] (Dinah Lance), the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] (Barry Allen), [[Green Lantern]] (Hal Jordan) and the [[Martian Manhunter]], but did not display them. Subsequent versions of Amazo have not shown any of Hourman's time powers.

A stripped down version of Amazo was recently destroyed in Gotham City. Lacking a power ring and lasso, this robot had the abilities of at least Superman, Flash and Aquaman. [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] managed to partially disable it- an explosive Batarang damaged the android's leg (Preventing him from using Flash's speed), two small needles punctured its inner-ears, destroying its internal gyroscope (thus rendering its flying powers useless), and plastic explosive destroyed Amazo's eyes when it attempted to use heat vision- and used a missile launched from the Batmobile to finish the job. Another Amazo appeared as part of the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]], but this Amazo had his head ripped from his shoulders by [[Black Adam]] (to get revenge for imprisoning him) and was thus destroyed.

It has not been established whether or not there is one Amazo or many. The incident with Batman and Nightwing suggests that there are multiple Amazos, each one incorporating different powers (Although Amazo typically duplicates the powers of the five original JLA members in his 'default' form). This would also account for all of the different times the android has been destroyed.

==Powers and abilities==
Using "absorption cells" Amazo was able to duplicate the powers of any [[metahuman]] he encounters. Originally, he could only use one power at a time and has duplicated [[Superman]]'s strength, The [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'s speed, [[Green Lantern]]'s power ring and [[Wonder Woman]]'s magic lasso among others. In most cases, Amazo possesses a 'default' form consisting of the powers of the first five JLA members, capable of adapting to incorporate other powers. After years of battling the JLA to a standstill, he recently "upgraded" by absorbing part of [[Hourman Android|Hourman's]] Worlogog which gave him [[time travelling]] powers as well.

==Alternate Versions==
*In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Amazo was sent to kill off multiple villains by a mysterious background manipulator. He was eventually confronted by the [[Barry Allen|Flash]] as he attempted to kill [[Ra's Al Ghul]], and the Flash was able to remove Amazo's brain by vibrating to become intangible at such a rapid rate that Amazo could not process the power himself. In the sequel, the brain of the crippled [[Oliver Queen]] was transferred into Amazo, but he subsequently sacrificed himself to save the universe.

*During a flashback in [[JLA/Avengers]] #3 (during the story, reality is altered making it appear that both teams have been crossing into each others universe previously), an adventure is mentioned about [[Ultron|Ultron-4]] and Amazo imprisoning both teams in their own headquarters.

*Before his introduction in Justice League Season Two, Amazo made an animated style appearance in Justice League Adventures #6.  The issue is definitely non canon, as it portrays him in his classic silver age style, rather than his silver skin.

* In ''[[Tabula Rasa (Justice League episode)|Tabula Rasa, Part 1]]'' (a second-season episode of the [[Justice League (animated series)|''Justice League'' animated series]]) the A.M.A.Z.O. Project was an android created by Professor Ivo, one of [[Lex Luthor|Lex Luthor's]] employees. Luthor had escaped from prison and needed Ivo's medical expertise, but found that Ivo had died in his sleep. Luthor persuaded the android (still watching over his creator's corpse) to help him defeat the Justice League. This version of Amazo (almost always called simply "the android" or "Ivo's android") possesses a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] construction, and could mimic the superpowers of any superhuman it could see. For example, it copied Superman's weakness to [[kryptonite]], but repeated exposure caused him to develop an immunity to it. 

It quickly mimicked the abilities of [[Hawkgirl]] (including forming a replica of her [[Nth Metal]] [[mace]]), [[Wonder Woman]], the [[Wally West|Flash]], [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], and [[Superman]]; it saw nothing worth mimicking in [[Batman]].

After mimicking the [[Martian Manhunter]]'s telepathy, it learned Luthor intended to destroy him after he killed the Justice League. Seeing itself above the petty squabbles of humanity, it left Earth and wandered the [[universe]] (''Tabula Rasa, Part 2''). 

* In a later episode (''The Return'' in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''), the android eventually returned to [[Earth]] - after becoming nearly omnipotent by absorbing the abilities of an untold number of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] species - and sought out Luthor. En route to Earth, Amazo 's path took him through the planet [[Oa]]; the planet appeared to be destroyed along with its entire population, despite the [[Green Lantern Corps]]' attempt to stop Amazo. While dozens of Justice League members made a futile attempt to stop the android, [[The Atom]] assisted Luthor in creating a weapon that would reprogram Amazo. The device failed because Amazo had, he said, "evolved beyond" his [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] origins.

Instead of killing Luthor, Amazo demanded to know what his purpose was. Luthor told the android it had to forge its own [[destiny]]. Amazo accepted that advice and stood down. When [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] protested that he destroyed Oa, Amazo explained that he simply placed the planet in another dimension to remove it from his path and replaced it immediately. [[Doctor Fate]] offered to help the android find its destiny, and Amazo moved into Dr. Fate's tower. 

* During ''Wake the Dead'', Amazo attempted to help the Justice League defeat a resurrected [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Amazo discovered that Grundy, (revived by "chaos magic") was drawing on his energy to make himself even more powerful. To prevent himself from being a danger until he could devise a way to counter the drain, Amazo teleported away from Earth. This was his final appearance; it was also the only time he was referred to as 'Amazo'.

''Wake the Dead'' was also notable as a continuation of the 'Defenders' storyline from ''The Terror Beyond'', where Justice League characters served as homages of the 1970's [[Marvel Comics]] series [[The Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]. Amazo, a shining, space-faring being who wielded cosmic power, was a stand-in for [[the Silver Surfer]]. See also [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Hawkgirl]], [[Doctor Fate]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], and [[Aquaman]].

* In ''Panic in The Sky'', Lex Luthor (secretly merged with [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]) had secretly built a copy of Amazo, complete with Luthor's face. However, [[Amanda Waller]] entered the room to arrest Luthor, and destroyed the android body as well. This triggered the big revelation that Brainiac had lain dormant within Luthor (influencing though not necessarily controlling his actions). 

Amazo was voiced by [[Robert Picardo]].

*Amazo appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Justice League: Chronicles]]'', where [[Gorilla Grodd]] used him to frame the Justice League for crimes against Gorilla City.
