'''Amazo''' was a fictional [[android]] from [[DC Comics]].

Amazo was built by [[Professor Ivo]] to battle the [[Justice League of America]]. Amazo was originally built to imitate the powers of the original JLA members: [[Wonder Woman]], [[Green Lantern]] (Hal Jordan), [[The Flash]] (Barry Allen), the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Aquaman]]. However, the lineup of the JLA's founding roster has been changed via [[retcon]]s, and it is currently uncertain how this changes Amazo's origin. Later versions of the robot appeared with differing abilities depending on which heroes he battled and later versions were able to evolve abilites simply by encountering heroes.

Amazo, in the guise of '''Timazo''', became the chief enemy of the android [[Hourman]] when he was able absorb a fraction of Hourman's infinite time manipulating abilities.
