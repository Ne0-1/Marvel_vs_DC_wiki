Other significant issues included an encounter with a depowered [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #480-483 (Feb. – May 1978), and  in ''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981) and #241-243 (Aug. – Oct. 1985).

A different Amazo model featured in ''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #12 (Fall 1993) and battled the hero [[Aztek (comics)|Aztek]] in ''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997) before being destroyed in ''[[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]]'' #2 (June 1997). An advanced version debuted in a one-off story in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #27 (March 1999), while another appeared in the [[limited series]] ''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'', specifically issues #1, #5-7, #17, and #19-21 (April 1999 – Dec. 2000).

Amazo's origin is revealed in ''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999). Another version is discovered to be part of a weapons shipment in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #636-637 (March – April 2005) and during the ''[[Villains United]]'' storyline in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' vol. 2, #14-16 (Aug. – Oct. 2005), ''Villains United'' #5-6 (Nov. – Dec. 2005), and the ''Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special'' (June 2006).

A story continuing the first Red Tornado storyline featured in ''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #21-23 (July – Sept. 2008).

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] noted, "Amazo was a persistent thorn in the JLA's side... although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest... His very existence is a hazard to all of humanity."<ref>{{Cite book | last=Conroy | first=Mike | authorlink=Mike Conroy (writer) | title=500 Comic Book Villains | publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]] | date=October 2004 | isbn=978-0-7641-2908-7}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The [[android (robot)|android]] Amazo was created by scientist [[Professor Ivo]], who became obsessed with [[immortality]]. The original Justice League of America ([[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Aquaman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and the [[Martian Manhunter]]) discover their powers have been drained and appear to be used in the theft of certain long-lived creatures. Attempting to guard the remainder of the creatures and discover the perpetrator, the League is defeated by Amazo. Ivo reveals he has created a means of extending his life span courtesy of the data obtained from studying the creatures, and almost succeeds in removing the League's memories of their having ever been heroes before being stopped by Green Lantern. The League defeat the android, and store it in their trophy room.

The android is re-activated twice to assist the League in regaining lost abilities<ref>''Justice League of America'' #27 (May 1964)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #111-112 (June – Aug. 1974)</ref> and later by accident when [[red sun]] radiation reaches Earth, although after an extensive battle involving time-travel [[Superman]] defeats the android, preventing his attempted murder of Ivo and the League.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #480-483 (Feb. – May 1978)</ref> Villain the [[Key (comics)|Key]] re-activates the android in a failed bid to restore his own shrunken stature, although, after the League defeat the android, member [[Zatanna]] restores the Key to his former state.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981)</ref>

Ivo reactivates Amazo for use against a weaker version of the League, with the android defeating all the new members until finally stopped by the Martian Manhunter and Aquaman.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August – October 1985)</ref> A different Amazo model is activated and battles the superhero team the [[Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]],<ref>''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #12 (Fall 1993)</ref> and while searching for Ivo encounters the hero Aztek, who reasons with the android.<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref> This version briefly battles the [[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]] before finally being destroyed.<ref>''Resurrection Man'' #2 (June 1997)</ref>

One version of Amazo is pulled from the timestream by a curious [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], who wishes to meet his "ancestor". Amazo responds by attacking Hourman and copying the "Worlogog", an artifact embedded in the android. Amazo then becomes "Timazo" and wreaks havoc with his new-found ability to manipulate time, until hurled back into the timestream as his former self by Hourman.<ref>''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'' #1 (April 1999)</ref> A current version of Amazo has several more encounters with Hourman.<ref>''Hourman'' #5-7 (Aug. – Oct. 1999), #17 (Aug. 2000), #19-21 (Oct. – Dec. 2000)</ref>

Another version, with the ability to absorb the abilities of the League on a conceptual level, overpowers over two dozen heroes, until Atom advises Superman to announce the team is disbanded. The premise that the League no longer exists deprives the android of purpose and it shuts down.<ref>''JLA'' #27 (March 1999)</ref> Batman and [[Nightwing]] discover a partial Amazo (lacking several abilities) in a weapons shipment, and manage to destroy the android by neutralizing its individual abilities before finally destroying it.<ref>''Batman'' #636-637 (March – April 2005)</ref>

Another Amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], but is deactivated when sometime hero [[Black Adam]] decapitates the android.<ref>''Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special'' (June 2006)</ref>

Ivo combines parts of the current Amazo with human [[Ovum|ova]] and [[DNA]] to create the android's "son". Awakened prematurely by an [[earthquake]], the junior version of Amazo believes itself to be a philosophy student called Frank Halloran and dates a girl called Sara. Amazo reveals the truth to his progeny, who attempts to resist his programming by becoming a hero called "Kid Amazo". Slowly becoming insane, Kid Amazo confronts Ivo and discovers Sara is Ivo's daughter and was placed to monitor the android. Batman deduces Kid Amazo has both the powers and the personalities of the JLA, and, during a battle with the League, creates dissension in the team that the android mimics, causing an internal logic error that destroys it.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #37-41 (June – Oct. 2007)</ref>

Ivo secretly downloads Amazo's programming into the body of the Red Tornado, the creation of sometime ally Professor [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]]. Several members of the JLA battle an army of Red Tornado androids, until discovering that Red Tornado's body is intended for the mind of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Although the process is prevented, the Amazo programming asserts itself and attacks the superhero team, with member [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] eventually destroying it.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #1-5 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007)</ref>

A new body is created for the Red Tornado, although the Amazo programming from the first body downloads into the shell. The android battles the JLA until teleported into the [[gravity well]] of the red star [[Antares]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21-23 (July – Sept. 2008)</ref>

===The New 52===
The first storyline takes place five years in the past and details the retconned origin of the original Justice League in ''[[The New 52]]'', a reboot of the DC Comics universe. In an origin story it is revealed that hero [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] was uploaded with Ivo's "A-maze" operating system among other features.<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #4 (Feb. 2012)</ref> The League later battle the android,<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #8 (June 2012)</ref> with it returning as part of the Secret Society of Super Villains.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1 (Sept. 2013)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The character in its various incarnations as an advanced android is capable of duplicating the powers of [[metahumans]], including members of the Justice League (such as the strength of [[Superman]] or the speed of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]). The androids apparently retain the abilities of the original Justice League of America ([[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Aquaman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and the [[Martian Manhunter]]) and were later written as being capable of simulating other characters' weapons, such as the [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] of [[Green Lantern]] and the Nth metal mace of [[Hawkgirl]].

==Other versions==
===Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew===
''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew]]'' #14-15 featured the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel Earth]] of "Earth-C-Minus", a world populated by [[funny animal]] superheroes that paralleled the mainstream [[DC Universe]].
