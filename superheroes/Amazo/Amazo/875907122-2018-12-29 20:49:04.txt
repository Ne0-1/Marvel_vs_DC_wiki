==Publication history==
Amazo first appeared in a one-off story in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #30 (June 1960) and returned as an opponent of the [[Justice League of America]] in ''Justice League of America'' #27 (May 1964) and #112 (Aug. 1974). Other significant issues included an encounter with a depowered [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #480-483 (Feb. – May 1978), and  in ''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981) and #241-243 (Aug. – Oct. 1985). Amazo also battles a fully powered Superman in ''Superman Special'' #3 (1985).

A different Amazo model featured in ''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #12 (Fall 1993) and battled the hero [[Aztek (comics)|Aztek]] in ''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997) before being destroyed in ''[[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]]'' #2 (June 1997). An advanced version debuted in a one-off story in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #27 (March 1999), while another appeared in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'', specifically issues #1, #5-7, #17, and #19-21 (April 1999 – Dec. 2000).

Amazo's origin is revealed in ''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999). Another version is discovered to be part of a weapons shipment in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #636-637 (March – April 2005) and during the ''[[Villains United]]'' storyline in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' vol. 2, #14-16 (Aug. – Oct. 2005), ''Villains United'' #5-6 (Nov. – Dec. 2005), and the ''Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special'' (June 2006).

A story continuing the first Red Tornado storyline featured in ''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #21-23 (July – Sept. 2008).

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] noted, "Amazo was a persistent thorn in the JLA's side... although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest... His very existence is a hazard to all of humanity."<ref>{{Cite book | last=Conroy | first=Mike | authorlink=Mike Conroy (writer) | title=500 Comic Book Villains | publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]] | date=October 2004 | isbn=978-0-7641-2908-7}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The android Amazo was created by scientist [[Professor Ivo]], who became obsessed with [[immortality]]. The original Justice League of America ([[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Aquaman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and the [[Martian Manhunter]]) discover their powers have been drained and appear to be used in the theft of certain long-lived creatures. Attempting to guard the remainder of the creatures and discover the perpetrator, the League is defeated by Amazo. Ivo reveals he has created a means of extending his life span courtesy of the data obtained from studying the creatures, and almost succeeds in removing the League's memories of their having ever been heroes before being stopped by Green Lantern. The League defeat the android, and store it in their trophy room. 
<ref>''The Brave and the Bold'' #30 (July 1960)</ref>

The android is re-activated twice to assist the League in regaining lost abilities<ref>''Justice League of America'' #27 (May 1964)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' #111-112 (June – Aug. 1974)</ref> and later by accident when [[red sun]] radiation reaches Earth, although after an extensive battle involving time-travel [[Superman]] defeats the android, preventing his attempted murder of Ivo and the League.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #480-483 (Feb. – May 1978)</ref> Supervillain the [[Key (comics)|Key]] re-activates the android in a failed bid to restore his own shrunken stature, although, after the League defeat the android, member [[Zatanna]] restores the Key to his former state.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981)</ref>

Ivo reactivates Amazo for use against a weaker version of the League, with the android defeating all the new members until finally stopped by the Martian Manhunter and Aquaman.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August – October 1985)</ref> A different Amazo model is activated and battles the superhero team the [[Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]],<ref>''Justice League Quarterly'' #12 (Fall 1993)</ref> and while searching for Ivo encounters the hero Aztek, who reasons with the android.<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref> This version briefly battles the [[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]] before finally being destroyed.<ref>''Resurrection Man'' #2 (June 1997)</ref>

One version of Amazo is pulled from the timestream by a curious [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], who wishes to meet his "ancestor". Amazo responds by attacking Hourman and copying the "Worlogog", an artifact embedded in the android. Amazo then becomes "Timazo" and wreaks havoc with his new-found ability to manipulate time, until hurled back into the timestream as his former self by Hourman.<ref>''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'' #1 (April 1999)</ref> A current version of Amazo has several more encounters with Hourman.<ref>''Hourman'' #5-7 (Aug. – Oct. 1999), #17 (Aug. 2000) and #19-21 (Oct. – Dec. 2000)</ref>

Another version, with the ability to absorb the abilities of the League on a conceptual level, overpowers over two dozen heroes, until Atom advises Superman to announce the team is disbanded. The premise that the League no longer exists deprives the android of purpose and it shuts down.<ref>''JLA'' #27 (March 1999)</ref> Batman and [[Nightwing]] discover a partial Amazo (lacking several abilities) in a weapons shipment and manage to deal with the android by neutralizing its individual abilities before finally destroying it.<ref>''Batman'' #636-637 (March – April 2005)</ref>

Another Amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], but is deactivated when sometime hero [[Black Adam]] destroys the android.<ref>''Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special'' (June 2006)</ref>

Ivo combines parts of the current Amazo with human [[Ovum|ova]] and [[DNA]] to create the android's "son". Awakened prematurely by an earthquake, the junior version of Amazo believes itself to be a philosophy student called Frank Halloran and dates a girl called Sara. Amazo reveals the truth to his progeny, who attempts to resist his programming by becoming a hero called "[[Kid Amazo]]". Slowly becoming insane, Kid Amazo confronts Ivo and discovers Sara is Ivo's daughter and was placed to monitor the android. Batman deduces Kid Amazo has both the powers and the personalities of the JLA and, during a battle with the League, creates dissension in the team that the android mimics, causing an internal logic error that destroys it.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #37-41 (June – Oct. 2007)</ref>

Ivo secretly downloads Amazo's programming into the body of the Red Tornado, the creation of sometime ally Professor [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]]. Several members of the JLA battle an army of Red Tornado androids, until discovering that Red Tornado's body is intended for the mind of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Although the process is prevented, the Amazo programming asserts itself and attacks the superhero team, with member [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] eventually destroying it.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #1-5 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007)</ref>

A new body is created for the Red Tornado, although the Amazo programming from the first body downloads into the shell. The android battles the JLA until it is teleported into the [[gravity well]] of the red star [[Antares]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21-23 (July – Sept. 2008)</ref>

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the first Amazo mention takes place five years in the past of the retconned origin of the Justice League when it is revealed that the superhero [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] was uploaded with Ivo's "A-maze" operating system, among other features.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #4 (Feb. 2012)</ref> The League later battle the android.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #8 (June 2012)</ref>

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Amazo appears as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1 (Sept. 2013)</ref>

During the ''[[Amazo Virus]]'' storyline, a biotech pathogen based on the android infected humans with Amazo's DNA, giving them fatal superpowers based on subconscious desires and personal characteristics. In the end, the virus took complete control of a host; a former Lexcorp employee named '''Armen Ikarus''', turning him into the new Amazo. It also transmutes young '''Reggie Meyer''' and turning him into '''[[Kid Amazo|Kid-Amazo]]''', utilizing [[cloning]] and sharing a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive-mind]]. <ref>''Super Sons'' #1 </ref>

==Powers and abilities==

===Amazo (Android)===
Amazo is an advanced android built using Prof. Ivo's Absorption Cell technology, capable of absorbing any and all natural skills and special abilities of an individual he gets close enough to, whether the source be alien, [[metahumans|superpowered]], or a non-powered flesh and blood (such as the strength of [[Superman]], the speed of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], or the deductive intellect of [[Batman]]). Initially it only retained the powers, aspects and traits of the original seven members of the JLA; eventually it was revealed that the android is apparently able to retain the abilities of the targets he originally copied, switching between any of them instantly. However, he was only able to access a single target's unique attributes at a time.<ref>''The Brave and the Bold'' Vol. 1 #30 (July, 1, 1960)</ref> Later versions of the character upgraded to not only being able to physically replicate and utilize multiple powers at once from anyone he has come in contact with, but simulating their weapons & equipment functions as well, such as the [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] of [[Green Lantern]], the Nth metal mace of [[Hawkgirl]], or the Lasso of Truth of [[Wonder Woman]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 1 #27, 65 & 112 (1960)</ref> 

Further modifications to its design down the line enables the android to copy, assimilate and combine multiple powers on the fly at a conceptual level; at full capacity Amazo was capable of emulating multiple skills from numerous heroes at a time; such as nuclear manipulation from [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], electrostatic discharge from [[Black Lightning]],
or size alteration from [[Plastic Man]] without hindrance,<ref>''JLA'' Vol 1 #27 (Mar. 1999)</ref>combining and utilizing them in creative ways on the fly while battling an enlarged Justice league and besting them with ease. Amazo also boasted an incredibly tactile and analytical cybermind, giving it a natural genius level intelligence and strategic processor which let the android adapt and assess the best possible maneuvers to apply its powers to defeat the current threat.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 2 #22 (Jul. 2008)</ref> Through this he is capable of best utilizing absorbed attributes he has emulated on a personal Recall Slate, which enables him to apply previously copied abilities on demand to deal with the situation at hand, i.e., adapting red solar radiation via Firestorm's powers to incapacitate Superman or plotting an Extra-Dimensional Extrusion to defuse Firestorm within his own matrix.<ref>''Justice League of America'' Vol. 2 #23 (Aug. 2008)</ref>

===Amazo (Ikarus)===
The latest iteration created during the '''Amazo Virus''' outbreak was a former scientist and researcher at Lexcorp who was the first to be exposed, becoming the eponymous Patient Zero when the epidemic hit.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #36 (Jan. 2015)</ref> Exposure to the virus at its most concentrated caused Ikarus's body and mind to mutate, ultimately erasing the core personality that once was Ikarus in order to build a better host incubator for the production and spread of the virus.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #37 (Feb. 2015)</ref> As the original infected, Amazo's virus form has the ability to infect other individuals with its own affliction, causing them to develop psychoactive superhuman abilities based upon their inherent desires and characteristics; this act of power bestowal was fatal to the recipient however, as they would ultimately die within 24 hours of contracting the disease. 

Stage 1 effects those exposed with flu-like symptoms until reaching Stage 2, where they undergo meta-manifestation gaining powers that reflect the persona, wherein Stage 3 their genetics break down causing cardiovascular failure and brain degeneration; inevitably killing the victim.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #36 (Jan. 2015)</ref> At the same time the plague-wearing ''Patient Zero'' could emulate whatever abilities or equipment an individual possessed by crudely modifying their genetic template to simulate those powers or functions of said gear an adversary used, such as sprouting wings to simulate flight ability or alternating the eyes to convey Superman-like heat vision.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #37 (Feb. 2015)</ref> Initially the virus host appeared in a degenerated state that could barely process and adjust its own physiological structure to copy the powers of those it faced. Because of the virus' ability to control its own rate of mutation and evolution, the programmable cells infecting him allow almost instant biophysical modification to bolster the hosts it/he infects. Through this, Amazo's current form had generated great enough bone density, skin elasticity and muscle mass to increase its sheer size enough to tear through crowded streets and battle three of the Justice League with some effort.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #37 (Feb. 2015)</ref> Amazo can remotely augment the infected's physical prowess enough to enable an infected Batman enough strength to restrain a full-power Kryptonian, eventually changing and evolving into a more complete form that better resembled the original Amazo.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #39 (Apr. 2015)</ref> 

Further still the intelligence behind the pathogen could either augment any natural physical characteristics of those stricken or bestow powers onto powerless individuals and deactivate those in other metahumans.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #36 (Feb. 2015)</ref> Even those powered through magic like Shazam, or with enhanced metabolisms like Flash or Aquaman, individuals Amazo takes hold of are vulnerable to its thrall via hive mind gestalt that lets Amazo control its scattered material, enabling it to control and empower multiple hosts at a time.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #39 (Apr. 2015)</ref>Individuals who are controlled in such a way tend to speak in unison with the original virus host, as if possessed by the legion; Lex Luthor deduced that the spread had a consciousness of its own while he was experimenting on test animals.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #39 (Apr. 2015)</ref>

==Other versions==
===Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!===
''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!]]'' #14-15 featured the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel Earth]] of "Earth-C-Minus", a world populated by [[funny animal]] superheroes that paralleled the mainstream [[DC Universe]]. On Earth-C-Minus a counterpart of the character Amazo existed called "'''Amazoo'''": a robotic composite of a dozen different animal body parts and abilities.

===DC Super Friends===
Amazo appears in the ''[[DC Super Friends]]'' comics. <ref>''DC Super Friends'' $18</ref>

===Injustice 2===
Amazo appears in the ''[[Injustice 2]]'' comics based on the ''[[Injustice]]'' reality. After the fall of Chancellor Superman's Regine, Ivo sold off Amazo to a terrorist initiative under the control of [[Ra's al Ghul]] and [[Solovar]]. <ref>''Injustice 2 #12''</ref> <ref>''Injustice 2 #17''</ref> <ref>''Injustice 2 #20''</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
====Live-action====
* Amazo is featuted in the TV shows taking place in the [[Arrowverse]]:
** In ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', Dr. Ivo inhabited a ship called the ''Amazo'' where he tested experiments with Mirakuru serum and tortured his captives. The ship was eventually taken over by [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Slade Wilson]] (who was going insane due to the Mirakuru serum) after he killed its former captain, "The Butcher", and cut off Ivo's hand. Following Slade's defeat by Oliver and the death of Ivo and his crew, the ship became wrecked on the shores of Lian Yu.
** The android Amazo, or A.M.A.Z.O. ('''A'''nti-'''M'''etahuman '''A'''daptive '''Z'''ootomic '''O'''rganism), debuts in the ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' crossover. Built by Ivo Laboratories for [[A.R.G.U.S.]], it is capable of replicating metahuman powers. In "[[Elseworlds, Part 1]]", A.M.A.Z.O. is awakened when [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]] (who switched lives with [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] under mysterious circumstances and became the Flash) accidentally throws a stray lightning bolt at it. In a climactic battle, it is defeated by a computer virus made by [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] with the help of [[Superman]], [[Supergirl (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], Flash, and Green Arrow (who, due to the switch, is Barry Allen). A.M.A.Z.O. is brought back by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] as he rewrites reality during the crossover's final battle in "Elseworlds, Part 3" , only to be confronted and defeated by [[Brainiac 5]] of [[Supergirl (TV series)|Earth-38]].

====Animated====
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' two-part episode "Tabula Rasa", voiced by [[Robert Picardo]]. Here he is depicted being a grey blank like humanoid, only referred to as The Android. Unlike other incarnations, Amazo is able to access any and all abilities replicated simultaneously. Also, while initially obtaining any target's weakness and various character flaws (i.e. Flash's unfocused and flirting nature or Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite respectively), he can eventually adapt away these flaws. Amazo was found by Luthor who was seeking Dr. Ivo after a battle with the League destroyed part of his battle suit. Upon discovering Ivo's death and Amazo's abilities, Luthor uses the android to steal the League's powers and steal parts needed to fix his body. However after absorbing Martian Manhunter's abilities, Amazo learns the truth, becoming a gold form and setting off for space, intent on finding meaning in his existence. 
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episodes "The Return" and "Wake the Dead", voiced once again by Robert Picardo. Amazo had obtained godhood, having demonstrated the ability to teleport Oa away, giving the appearance that he had destroyed it. His intent was to kill Luthor for using him, going through every member of the Justice League in the process. Ultimately, he gives up his quest for revenge due to the words of Doctor Fate, returning Oa, and is given sanctuary in the Tower of Fate to find his purpose. Amazo returns in "Wake the Dead", trying to stop the newly empowered and resurrected Solomon Grundy. However, even Amazo's attacks do nothing to the zombie, causing him to teleport away to find a solution. Amazo is briefly mentioned during part 3 of the season 2 finale, "Panic in the Sky". Luthor reveals he set up the League so Project Cadmus could destroy them. This distraction would allow Lex to transfer his mind into an Amazo-like body, which he crafted from stolen Cadmus tech. His plans are foiled, and [[Amanda Waller]] destroys the body.
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Schooled", voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]]. After replicating the powers of Black Canary, Captain Atom, Flash, Martian Manhunter, Red Tornado, and Superman, the Justice League was able to just barely defeat the android and dismantle it. While transporting the parts to a safe location, Professor Ivo intercepts the trucks and was able to reassemble his android. The Justice League's respective sidekicks, now called The Team, pursued Ivo and Amazo. Thanks to a timely aid by Artemis, the Team was able to exploit Amazo's inability to use more than one target's replicated powers at a time and cause it to explode.
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Triumvirate of Terror", voiced by [[Roger Rose]].
* Amazo was mentioned in the [[DC Nation]] short ''Enter Extremo''.
* Amazo appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode "Boo-ray for Bizarro", voiced by [[Thomas Lennon]]. In addition to replicating a target's skills, powers, and personal tools, he is also able to replicate mental prowess of an individual, as he obtained Batman's keen intuition. He arrives at the Justice League Watchtower with the intent to replicate the powers of every member in the Justice League and capture them before taking over the world. Amazo does make a reference to Professor Ivo who is dead. While capturing Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Superman, and Wonder Woman, he sends out a distress signal for all other League members to return to base. Before his trap can be sprung, [[Bizarro]] arrives. Wanting to join the League, Bizarro decides to help stop Amazo by bringing who he claims is the "Smartest Man in the Galaxy", which turns out to be [[Space Cabbie]]. As Amazo fights Bizarro while replicating his powers, the clone's backwards mentality conflicts with Amazo processing, ultimately overloading and destroy him.

===Film===
* Amazo appears in ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. In the story, Batman describes Amazo as an android "with the ability to absorb the powers of metahumans". However, Amazo does not display any powers other than super-strength, flight and heat vision, implying that it has at least absorbed [[Superman]]'s abilities. It has the same [[pressure points]] as a human being, is damaged by Batman's micro-bombs and its head is destroyed by [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] charges.

===Video games===
* Amazo appears in ''[[Justice League: Chronicles]]''.
* Amazo was mentioned as The Amazo Project in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', which is the project that gives the player’s custom character his/her powers.
