Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] noted, "Amazo was a persistent thorn in the JLA's side... although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest... His very existence is a hazard to all of humanity."<ref>{{Cite book | last=Conroy | first=Mike | authorlink=Mike Conroy (writer) | title=500 Comic Book Villains | publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]] | date=October 2004 | isbn=978-0764129087}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The [[android (robot)|android]] Amazo was built by insane scientist [[Professor Ivo]], who became obsessed with [[immortality]]. The original Justice League of America ([[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Barry Allen|Flash]], [[Aquaman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and the [[Martian Manhunter]]) encounter Amazo when experiencing a sudden loss of their abilities. Discovering that certain long-lived creatures are being collected, the heroes locate and battle Amazo, who defeats the entire team and steals their abilities. Ivo is revealed to be the mastermind behind the scheme and, using data collected from the captured specimens, creates a potion that will bestow immortality, hoping to escape his fear of death. The plan, however, is foiled by Green Lantern, and Ivo and Amazo are defeated.<ref>''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #30 (July 1960)</ref>

At the suggestion of team [[mascot]] [[Snapper Carr]], the Justice League reactivate Amazo to deal with an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] threat. Although the alien drains Amazo's abilities, the android's combined powers overload the creature as intended. The Justice League then defeats Amazo once again and returns the android to storage.<ref>''[[Justice League of America]]'' #27 (May 1964)</ref> When the Justice League lose their powers due to the machinations of the villain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]], the heroes reactivate Amazo once again. The android draws in their lost powers, which are eventually returned via technology devised by [[Batman]] and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #111-112 (June – August 1974)</ref>

[[Radiation]] from an exploding [[red sun]] in deep space reaches Earth and weakens Superman significantly. The radiation also revives Amazo, who defeats the remainder of the Justice League. Amazo then seeks out Ivo, wishing to be deactivated. Discovering Ivo cannot assist, the android decides to kill both Ivo and Superman. Superman is forced to create and use a machine called the "Supermobile" to compensate for his weakened state, and saves both Ivo and [[Lois Lane]] from Amazo. Superman then uses the device to travel five days into the future, when the effects of the red solar radiation have passed Earth. Newly empowered, Superman defeats Amazo and rescues the Justice League.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #480-483 (February – May 1978)</ref> Amazo is reactivated by former Justice League foe the [[Key (comics)|Key]], who seeks a cure for his current shrunken state by using the abilities of the superhero team. [[Katar Hol|Hawkman]], however, helps the Justice League defeat Amazo, and fellow member [[Zatanna]] restores the Key to his former state.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981)</ref>

Ivo reactivates Amazo for use against a weaker version of the League, with the android defeating all the new members until finally stopped by the Martian Manhunter and  Aquaman.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August – October 1985)</ref> A different Amazo model is activated and battles the superhero team the [[Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]]<ref>''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #12 (Fall 1993)</ref>, and while searching for Ivo encounters the hero Aztek, who reasons with the android.<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref> This version briefly battles the [[Resurrection Man]] before finally being destroyed.<ref>''Resurrection Man'' #2 (June 1997)</ref>

One version of Amazo is pulled from the timestream by a curious [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], who wishes to meet his "ancestor". Amazo responds by attacking Hourman and copying the "Worlogog", an artifact embedded in the android. Amazo then becomes "Timazo" and wreaks havoc with his new-found ability to manipulate time, until hurled back into the timestream as his former self by Hourman.<ref>''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'' #1 (April 1999)</ref> A current version of Amazo has several more encounters with Hourman.<ref>''Hourman'' #5-7 (August – October 1999), #17 (August 2000), #19-21 (October – December 2000)</ref>

Another version, with the ability to absorb the abilities of the League on a conceptual level, overpowers over two dozen heroes, until Atom tells Superman to announce the team is disbanded. The premise that the League no longer exists deprives the android of purpose and it shuts down.<ref>''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #27 (March 1999)</ref> Batman and [[Nightwing]] discover a partial Amazo (lacking several abilities) in a weapons shipment, and manage to destroy the android by deactivating its individual abilities, such as using explosive [[batarang]]s to damage its leg (preventing it from using the Flash's speed) and covering its eyes with plastic explosive (causing its eyes to be destroyed when it uses Superman's heat vision), before finally destroying it with a missile from the [[Batmobile]].<ref>''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #636-637 (March – April 2005)</ref>

Another Amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], but is deactivated when sometime hero [[Black Adam]] decapitates the android.<ref>''[[Villains United]]: [[Infinite Crisis]] Special'' (June 2006)</ref>

Ivo then uses parts of the current Amazo along with human [[Ovum|ova]] and [[DNA]] to create the android's "son". Awakened prematurely by an [[earthquake]], the junior version of Amazo believes itself to be a philosophy student called Frank Halloran, who dates a girl called Sara. Amazo reveals the truth to his progeny, who attempts to resist his programming by becoming a hero called "Kid Amazo". Slowly becoming insane, Kid Amazo confronts Ivo and discovers Sara is Ivo's daughter and was placed to monitor the android. Batman deduces Kid Amazo has both the powers and the personalities of the JLA, and during a battle with the League creates dissension in the team that the android mimics, causing an internal logic error that destroys it.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #37-41 (June – October 2007)</ref>

Ivo secretly downloads Amazo's programming into the body of the Red Tornado, the creation of sometime ally Professor [[T.O. Morrow]]. Several members of the JLA battle an army of Red Tornado androids, until discovering that Red Tornado's body is intended for the mind of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Although the process is prevented, the Amazo progamming asserts itself and attacks the superhero team, despite their attempts to dismantle the android. Member [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] eventually destroys the Red Tornado body by shearing it in half.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #1-5 (October 2006 – March 2007)</ref>

A new body is created for the Red Tornado, although the Amazo programming from the first body downloads into the shell. The android battles the JLA until teleported into the [[gravity well]] of the red star [[Antares]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21-23 (July – September 2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Professor Ivo's Amazo androids use "absorption cells" to duplicate the powers of [[metahumans]], such as Superman's strength and the speed of the Flash. Later versions are also capable of copying objects, such as the [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] of Green Lantern and the Nth metal mace of [[Hawkgirl]]. All versions apparently retain the base abilities of the original five members of the Justice League first encountered.

==Other versions==
The series ''[[Adventures in the DC Universe]]'' features a battle between the JLA and Amazo, with the android finally stopped by an [[electromagnetic pulse]].<ref>''[[Adventures in the DC Universe]]'' #18 (September 1998)</ref>

The limited series ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' reveals, in flashback, that Amazo attacked and crippled [[Oliver Queen|Green Arrow]] during a battle with the JLA. The android is eventually deactivated by the [[Barry Allen|Flash]] when he is dispatched by the story's mastermind to kill the [[League of Assassins]]. Taking advantage of the fact that Amazo can only ''copy'' his powers, rather than use them inventively, Flash turns intangible while Amazo is attacking him, and removes Amazo's brain before Amazo can process Flash's new tactic and use it himself.<ref>''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' #1-3 (September – November 1998)</ref> In the sequel, ''JLA: Another Nail'', the brain of the crippled Green Arrow is transferred into Amazo, who sacrifices himself to save the universe.<ref>''JLA: Another Nail'' #1-3 (July – September 2004)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Amazo has appeared in the animated television series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001–2004) and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004–2006) voiced by [[Robert Picardo]]. Even though he is called "A.M.A.Z.O." on Ivo's blueprints, he is usually referred to as "Ivo's android" or just "The Android" ([[Doctor Fate]] and [[Lex Luthor]] referred to him as "Amazo" on separate occasions, however). He first appeared in "Tabula Rasa, Part 1 and 2" when Lex Luthor stumbled upon the house of Dr. Ivo (already found dead), hoping for him to help rebuild his damaged suit to contain his cancer, and found Amazo. Discovering Amazo's powers when Amazo copied his face, Luthor used the Android to help him in his quest against the League. Amazo proved to be more than a match for the League when he copied their combined powers; however, Luthor's downfall came when Amazo copied the [[Martian Manhunter]]'s powers and read Luthor's mind, discovering that he was just using him all along. After trouncing Luthor, he flew off into space using [[Hawkgirl]]'s and [[Superman]]'s powers. It was commented that he may evolve into a god with his copying powers. He later appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "The Return", where his powers have evolved to the point where it took the combined League to hold him off long enough for the [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]] and Lex Luthor to devise a weapon capable of defeating him using the original plans for the Android designed to neutralize Amazo's [[nanotechnology]]. Firing the weapon, it was revealed that Amazo has even evolved beyond the nanotechnology from which it was once made. However, it is revealed that Amazo was not seeking revenge on Luthor as initially thought, but in fact was looking for his philosophical advice on the meaning of existence. It is later revealed that Luthor originally activated Amazo as part of a complex scheme to gain momentary access to his blueprints, which Luthor promptly memorizes using his [[photographic memory]]. He attempted to transfer his mind into the body of a second Amazo, but [[Amanda Waller]] destroyed the body during her attempt to arrest Luthor.

Even though he never appeared on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', several nods to him are made in the series finale "Lost Heroes". The episode has [[Hugo Strange|Professor Hugo Strange]] aid the Joining in an effort to capture the super-powered members of the Justice League. The Joining saps the members of their powers and uses them to build robotic replicas of the League. Batman defeated the robots by giving the other members weapons that would simulate the heroes' weaknesses. After the robots were destroyed, the heroes had their powers restored. Near the end of the episode, some residue of the Justice League's powers coat the leader of the Joining, giving him all of the Justice League's powers, and making him a lot like Amazo. The idea of robots having the powers of the Justice League is likely inspired by Amazo.

===Film===
Amazo appears in the 2010 [[Warner Bros.]] direct-to-[[DVD]] animation ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]{{fact|date=December 2010}}, who was uncredited for the role. He was being delivered to [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s gang when some of [[Red Hood]]'s henchmen took him away on a truck. Batman interfered and in the struggle Amazo was activated, apparently with the powers of Superman or a similarly-powered being (i.e., invulnerability, super-strength, flight, and heat-beam eye blasts). He proved to be quite formidable, but was subdued after Nightwing showed up to aide his former mentor. Amazo's head was blown off with [[Plastic explosive|plastique]] and his remains were confiscated by Batman.

===Video games===
Amazo appears in the [[video game]] ''[[Justice League: Chronicles]]'' (2003).
