'''Amazo''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #30 (June 1960) and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Murphy Anderson]]. An android, Amazo's special ability is to replicate the special abilities of various superheroes and supervillains he comes into contact with. Throughout publication, Amazo has most frequently been a villain for the [[Justice League]], an assembly of DC's most well-known superheroes; Amazo also permanently replicated the powers and abilities of the first Justice League he encountered, making him a very powerful adversary in all subsequent appearances. Later on, however, he became a member of the Justice League.

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character has appeared in comic books and other DC Comics-related products, including [[animated]] [[television series]], [[trading card]]s and [[video games]].

==Publication history==

Other significant issues included an encounter with a depowered [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #480-483 (February – May 1978), and after he had been reactivated by red sun radiations in ''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981) and #241-243 (August – October 1985).

A different Amazo model featured in ''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #12 (Fall 1993) and battled the hero [[Aztek (comics)|Aztek]] in ''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997) before being destroyed in ''[[Resurrection Man]]'' #2 (June 1997). An advanced version debuted in a one-off story in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #27 (March 1999), and another appeared in the [[limited series]] ''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'', specifically issues #1, #5-7, #17, and #19-21 (April 1999 – December 2000).

Amazo's origin is revealed in ''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (December 1999). Another version is discovered to be part of a weapons shipment in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #636-637 (March – April 2005) and during the ''[[Villains United]]'' storyline in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' (vol. 2) #14-16 (August – October 2005), ''Villains United'' #5-6 (November – December 2005), and the ''Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special'' (June 2006).

A story continuing the first Red Tornado storyline featured in ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21-23 (July – September 2008).

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] noted, "Amazo was a persistent thorn in the JLA's side... although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest... His very existence is a hazard to all of humanity."<ref>{{Cite book | last=Conroy | first=Mike | authorlink=Mike Conroy (writer) | title=500 Comic Book Villains | publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]] | date=October 2004 | isbn=978-0-7641-2908-7}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The [[android (robot)|android]] Amazo was built by insane scientist [[Professor Ivo]], who became obsessed with [[immortality]]. The original Justice League of America ([[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Aquaman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and the [[Martian Manhunter]]) encounter Amazo after experiencing the sudden loss of their abilities. After hearing reports that certain long-lived creatures are being stolen in unusual ways (a catfish was stolen using a green beam to cut through the wall, and a [[cicada]] was captured with a golden lasso), the team deduces their powers have actually been stolen. The heroes split up to guard other long-lived animals, only to be defeated in turn (except for Superman and Batman) by Amazo, who locks the entire team in gas-filled cylinders. Before erasing their memories, Ivo reveals himself as the mastermind behind the scheme and that, using data collected from the captured animals, he will create a serum of longevity. By extending his lifespan by 500 years, Ivo hopes to conquer his fear of death and the World (as he can always create more serum, or perfect it into true immortality). Thinking himself ahead since Batman has no superpowers and he possesses a piece of [[kryptonite]] to defeat Superman, Ivo is foiled by Green Lantern. The Lantern had used some of the yellow-colored chlorine gas to protect himself from the memory erasing before recharging his ring and using it to draw Amazo's powers away, restoring the League's powers & minds. Ivo and Amazo are defeated, with Ivo being jailed (ironically sentenced to 500 years), and Amazo being stored in the Justice League trophy room.<ref>''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #30 (July 1960)</ref>

At the suggestion of team [[mascot]] [[Snapper Carr]], the Justice League reactivates Amazo to deal with an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] threat that has drained their success factor. Although the alien drains Amazo's abilities, the android's combined powers overload the creature as intended, causing it to become inert and giving the team back their success factor. The Justice League then defeats Amazo once again and returns the android to storage.<ref>''[[Justice League of America]]'' #27 (May 1964)</ref> When the Justice League lose half of their individual powers due to the machinations of the villain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]], the heroes reactivate Amazo once again. The android draws in their lost powers, which are eventually returned via technology devised by [[Batman]] and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #111-112 (June – August 1974)</ref>

[[Radiation]] from an exploding [[red sun]] in deep space reaches Earth and weakens Superman significantly. The radiation also revives Amazo, who defeats the remainder of the Justice League, and imprisons them, though making sure they can watch him. Amazo then seeks out Ivo, wishing to be deactivated. Discovering Ivo cannot assist, the android decides to kill both Ivo and Superman; however, they escape with a teleportation device Superman had hidden in his mouth to the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. Superman is forced to create and use a machine called the "Supermobile" to compensate for his weakened state, which shields him from the radiation and is able to imitate his powers, along with other attachments, with which he battles against Amazo and saves both Ivo and [[Lois Lane]]. Superman then uses the device to travel five days into the future, when the effects of the red solar radiation have passed Earth. Newly empowered, Superman defeats Amazo and rescues the Justice League.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #480-483 (February – May 1978)</ref> Amazo is reactivated by former Justice League foe the [[Key (comics)|Key]], who seeks a cure for his current shrunken state by using the abilities of the superhero team. [[Katar Hol|Hawkman]], however, helps the Justice League defeat Amazo, and fellow member [[Zatanna]] restores the Key to his former state.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #191 (June 1981)</ref>

Ivo reactivates Amazo for use against a weaker version of the League, with the android defeating all the new members until finally stopped by the Martian Manhunter and Aquaman.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August – October 1985)</ref> A different Amazo model is activated and battles the superhero team the [[Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]],<ref>''[[Justice League Quarterly]]'' #12 (Fall 1993)</ref> and while searching for Ivo encounters the hero Aztek, who reasons with the android.<ref>''Aztek: The Ultimate Man'' #10 (May 1997)</ref> This version briefly battles the [[Resurrection Man]] before finally being destroyed.<ref>''Resurrection Man'' #2 (June 1997)</ref>

One version of Amazo is pulled from the timestream by a curious [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], who wishes to meet his "ancestor". Amazo responds by attacking Hourman and copying the "Worlogog", an artifact embedded in the android. Amazo then becomes "Timazo" and wreaks havoc with his new-found ability to manipulate time, until hurled back into the timestream as his former self by Hourman.<ref>''[[Hourman (android)|Hourman]]'' #1 (April 1999)</ref> A current version of Amazo has several more encounters with Hourman.<ref>''Hourman'' #5-7 (August – October 1999), #17 (August 2000), #19-21 (October – December 2000)</ref>

Another version, with the ability to absorb the abilities of the League on a conceptual level, overpowers over two dozen heroes, until Atom tells Superman to announce the team is disbanded. The premise that the League no longer exists deprives the android of purpose and it shuts down.<ref>''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #27 (March 1999)</ref> Batman and [[Nightwing]] discover a partial Amazo (lacking several abilities) in a weapons shipment, and manage to destroy the android by deactivating its individual abilities, such as using explosive [[batarang]]s to damage its leg (preventing it from using the Flash's speed) and covering its eyes with plastic explosive (causing its eyes to be destroyed when it uses Superman's heat vision), before finally destroying it with a missile from the [[Batmobile]].<ref>''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' (vol. 1) #636-637 (March – April 2005)</ref>

Another Amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], but is deactivated when sometime hero [[Black Adam]] decapitates the android.<ref>''[[Villains United]]: [[Infinite Crisis]] Special'' (June 2006)</ref>

Ivo then uses parts of the current Amazo along with human [[Ovum|ova]] and [[DNA]] to create the android's "son". Awakened prematurely by an [[earthquake]], the junior version of Amazo believes itself to be a philosophy student called Frank Halloran, who dates a girl called Sara. Amazo reveals the truth to his progeny, who attempts to resist his programming by becoming a hero called "Kid Amazo". Slowly becoming insane, Kid Amazo confronts Ivo and discovers Sara is Ivo's daughter and was placed to monitor the android. Batman deduces Kid Amazo has both the powers and the personalities of the JLA, and during a battle with the League creates dissension in the team that the android mimics, causing an internal logic error that destroys it.<ref>''JLA Classified'' #37-41 (June – October 2007)</ref>

Ivo secretly downloads Amazo's programming into the body of the Red Tornado, the creation of sometime ally Professor [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]]. Several members of the JLA battle an army of Red Tornado androids, until discovering that Red Tornado's body is intended for the mind of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Although the process is prevented, the Amazo programming asserts itself and attacks the superhero team, despite their attempts to dismantle the android. Member [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] eventually destroys the Red Tornado body by shearing it in half.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #1-5 (October 2006 – March 2007)</ref>

A new body is created for the Red Tornado, although the Amazo programming from the first body downloads into the shell. The android battles the JLA until teleported into the [[gravity well]] of the red star [[Antares]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #21-23 (July – September 2008)</ref>

===The New 52===
The first storyline takes place five years in the past and details the retconned origin of the original Justice League in ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe). [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] appears as a high school football star who is heavily sought after by a number of college scouts, but apparently has a distant relationship with his father, Silas. After winning a big game, Victor is shown calling his father and angrily telling him that he broke his promise and missed yet another one of his son's games. Later Victor appears at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] where his father works. The scientists appear to be working on the Mother Box that [[Superman]] came in contact with from the [[Parademon]]. Victor engages in another argument with his father and tells him that the scouts were there to give him full scholarships to college. When asked if his father will ever appear at any of his games, his father replies "No." Just then the [[Mother Box]] explodes killing the scientists and destroying most of Victor's body, to which Victor's father looks in horror--Victor and half of his body destroyed. Silas does everything he can for Victor's survival. He along with Sarah Charles, and [[T. O. Morrow]] go in "The Red Room" in S.T.A.R. labs which contains every piece of technology from around the world. In Justice League #4 Silas attempts to treat Victor with something that has never been attempted before and he is seen injecting Victor with some type of nanites and putting the robotic pieces on Victor (devices such as: a Promethean skin graft, Doctor William Magnus' responsometer, Anthony Ivo's A-maze operating system, The classified and prototypical B-maze operating system and Ryan Choi's White Dwarf Stabilizer) which turns Victor into Cyborg.In the issue, he sees himself for the first time with his robotic parts. He cannot feel his hands or legs. Just then Parademons attempt to kill Sarah, but Victor fires a cannon from his arm. When Victor asks his father what has happened to him, his father tells him that he had to save him by injecting him with nanites. Angry that his father has done this to him, Victor "super leaps" away from his father. He sees a woman being chased by Parademons. He helps the woman, but is somehow transported or teleported to where Batman, Green Lantern, Superman, Flash, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman are fighting the Parademons, moments before [[Darkseid]] arrives. In the back of Justice League #4 which contains S.T.A.R. Labs Employee files, reveals that Professor Ivo(here the Project Director of the A-Maze Operating System) has pioneered  the organic pattern process: the means of creating technology to mimic organic life down to a cellular level, which lead to the successful creation of A-Maze OS that mimics cellular regeneration in the field test with the mice. Consequently a parallel support program based on Ivo's design, the B- Maze Operating System, was built without Ivo's knowledge. It has showed results comparable to those of A-Maze OS.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #4 (February 2012)</ref>

5 years later into the current day, Amazo had officially appeared in Justice League #8 being defeated by the Justice League. <ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #8 (June 2012)</ref> Later the Head of A.R.G.U.S. and World's former Liaison to the Justice League [[Steve Trevor|Colonel Steve Trevor]] and his aide [[Etta Candy]] were discussing the events saying the League's fight with Amazo caused million dollars of damage and the city's want to sue someone which leads A.R.G.U.S. establish and result of damage was [[Green Arrow]]'s fault stating the "Justice League" doesn't make mistakes. <ref>''DC Comics The New 52 Free Comic Book Day comic'' #1 (June 2012)</ref> Superman and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] later head to discuss the threat of the supervillain, H'EL with [[Lex Luthor]], who is currently the only prisoner in a U.S. Military Facility of Lex's design which contains many safeguards to keep him contained such as the '''A'''utomated '''M'''eta '''A'''dapting '''Z'''eta-'''O'''perating Defense which power is the moment someone touches the ground, they can lock onto that person's gene code and react accordingly.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 6 #15 (February 2013)</ref>

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Amazo is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Professor Ivo's Amazo androids use "absorption cells" to duplicate the powers of [[metahumans]], such as Superman's strength, Flash's speed, Batman's skills and intellect, and the abilities of Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter. He has also demonstrated using the abilities of Atom and Elongated Man and Black Canary. Later versions are also capable of copying objects, such as the [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] of [[Green Lantern]], Wonder Woman's magic lasso, and the Nth metal mace of [[Hawkgirl]]. All versions apparently retain the base abilities of the original five members of the Justice League first encountered.

==Other versions==
===Adventures in the DC Universe===
The series ''[[Adventures in the DC Universe]]'' features a battle between the JLA and Amazo, with the android finally stopped by an [[electromagnetic pulse]].<ref>''[[Adventures in the DC Universe]]'' #18 (September 1998)</ref>

===JLA: The Nail===
The limited series ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' reveals, in flashback, that Amazo attacked and crippled [[Oliver Queen|Green Arrow]] during a battle with the JLA (He is also recorded as having killed [[Hawkman]], but this is never explicitly shown). The android is eventually deactivated by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] when he is dispatched by the story's mastermind to kill the [[League of Assassins]]. Taking advantage of the fact that Amazo can only ''copy'' his powers, rather than use them inventively, Flash turns intangible while Amazo is attacking him, and removes Amazo's brain before Amazo can process Flash's new tactic and use it himself.<ref>''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' #1-3 (September – November 1998)</ref> In the sequel, ''JLA: Another Nail'', the brain of the crippled Green Arrow is transferred into Amazo, who sacrifices himself to save the universe.  It is also established that Amazo was reverse-engineered from the [[New Gods]] technology.<ref>''JLA: Another Nail'' #1-3 (July – September 2004)</ref>

===JLA/Avengers===
When reality has been warped by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]], Wonder Woman is talking to Cap about previous encounters they have had, the first of which was battling against a team-up of [[Ultron]]-5 and Amazo. Later Amazo is seen as one of the last villains guarding Krona's base, and helps to overwhelm [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Amazo was a corrections officer of the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|military Doom prison]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Amazo is controlled by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] via a mental interface.<ref>''Flashpoint: Legion of Doom'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

===Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew===
The 1980s series ''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew]]'' presented the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel Earth]] of "Earth-C-Minus," a world populated by [[funny animal]] superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus had a counterpart of Amazo named "Amazoo." Amazoo's android body is a robotic composite of a dozen different animals' body parts and abilities.<ref>''Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew'' #14-15 (April - May 1983)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Amazo has appeared in the animated television series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' voiced by [[Robert Picardo]]. Even though he is called "A.M.A.Z.O." on Ivo's blueprints, he is usually referred to as "Ivo's android" or just "The Android" ([[Doctor Fate]] referred to him as "Amazo" on separate occasions, however). He first appeared in "Tabula Rasa, Part 1 and 2" when Lex Luthor stumbled upon the house of Dr. Ivo (already found dead), hoping for him to help rebuild his damaged suit to contain his cancer, and found Amazo. Discovering Amazo's powers when Amazo copied his face, Luthor used the Android to help him in his quest against the League, claiming that Ivo would have wanted Luthor to look after Amazo, and saying the League were bad. Amazo proved to be more than a match for the League when he copied their combined powers; however, Luthor's downfall came when the [[Martian Manhunter]] allowed Amazo to copy his powers and read Luthor's mind, discovering that he was just using him all along. Luthor activated a bomb near Amazo's head which Ivo had built in, but he survived using his shape-shifting powers. After trouncing Luthor, he flew off into space using [[Hawkgirl]]'s and [[Superman]]'s powers. It was commented that he may evolve into a god with his copying powers. This version of Amazo appeared as a smooth, gray, statuesque figure about 10 ft tall with a face that was featureless save for a pair of orange eyes that glow whenever he analyzes and copies a new ability. He also temporarily incorporated elements of the other characters' physique, such as Hawkgirl's wings and the Flash's lightning-shaped antennae, along with their characteristics.

* Amazo later appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Return" voiced again by [[Robert Picardo]]. His formerly gray "skin" now gleaming golden like at the end of Tabula Rasa, his powers have evolved to the point where the combined League, including nearly all of its reserve members, were unable to hold him off while the [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]] and Lex Luthor attempted to devise a weapon capable of defeating him using the original plans for the Android designed to neutralize Amazo's [[nanotechnology]]. Firing the weapon, it was revealed that Amazo has even evolved beyond the nanotechnology from which it was once made. Amazo had also defeated the entire force of the Green Lantern Corp on their home planet of Oa, before transporting the planet itself to another dimension (for no other reason than it was in his way) during his journey to Earth. However, it is revealed that Amazo was not seeking revenge on Lex Luthor as initially thought, but in fact was looking for his philosophical advice on the meaning of existence. Convinced by Lex Luthor to find the purpose of his existence by observing how life itself plays out over the seemingly endless eternity, Amazo decides to leave Lex Luthor. He then finds a home with Doctor Fate to further ponder this new course for his life. It is later revealed that Lex Luthor originally activated Amazo as part of a complex scheme to gain momentary access to his blueprints, which Lex Luthor promptly memorizes using his [[photographic memory]]. He attempted to transfer his mind into the body of a second Amazo, but [[Amanda Waller]] destroyed the body during her attempt to arrest Lex Luthor. He also appeared once more in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Wake the Dead," to help stop Solomon Grundy. It was realized that Grundy was absorbing energy, and so Amazo left both the fight and the planet in order to prevent his vast powers from aiding the rampaging monster and to consider how to approach the problem. "Wake the Dead" was Amazo's final appearance in the series and the [[DC animated universe]], and it was never established whether or not the android ever returned to Earth.

* Amazo appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Schooled" voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]] (who also voices Professor Ivo). This version is much more mechanical in appearance. Amazo had been in battle with the Justice League. In the process, Amazo copied the powers of Superman, Red Tornado, Black Canary, Martian Manhunter, Flash, Captain Atom and two other League members. When his parts were being shipped to different S.T.A.R. Labs in Boston and New York, the convoy is intercepted by other Professor Ivo robots. Superboy found Professor Ivo, who unleashed Amazo on him. Amazo was getting the upper hand on Superboy until Robin and Kid Flash arrived. Amazo managed to prevent Young Justice from apprehending Professor Ivo. Superboy defeats Amazo by sending his fist through Amazo's head just when it returned from being intangible thus destroying it. The rest of Amazo's parts were shipped to S.T.A.R. Labs. In "Runaways," Amazo's parts were shipped to a S.T.A.R. Labs building in [[Taos, New Mexico]] and end up targeted by Red Volcano.

* Amazo appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' in the episode "Triumvirate of Terror" voiced by [[Roger Rose]]. He appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom (DC Comics)|Legion of Doom]] attempting to beat the [[Justice League International]] in a baseball game.

* In the third episode of season two of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', titled "Broken Dolls", Oliver is shown to be kidnapped and imprisoned aboard a boat named "Amazo" during a flashback to his time on the island Lian Yu.

===Film===
* Amazo appears in the 2010 [[Warner Bros.]] direct-to-[[DVD]] animation ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'' voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]] who was uncredited for the role. He was being delivered to [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s gang when some of [[Red Hood]]'s henchmen took him away on a truck. Batman interfered and in the struggle Amazo was activated, apparently with the powers of Superman, Supergirl, Power Girl, or Martian Manhunter (i.e., invulnerability, super-strength, flight, and heat-beam eye blasts). He proved to be quite formidable, but was subdued after Nightwing showed up to aid his former mentor. Amazo's head was blown off with [[Plastic explosive|plastique]] and his remains were confiscated by Batman.

===Video games===
* Amazo appears in the [[video game]] ''[[Justice League: Chronicles]]'' (2003).
