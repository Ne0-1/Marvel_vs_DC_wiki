==Publication history==
Hala the Accuser first appeared in ''Guardians of Knowhere'' #3 and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and Valerio Schiti.

==Fictional character biography==
Hala the Accuser is a member of the [[Kree]] Empire's Accuser Corps. She was the last of its members when Hala was destroyed during the fall of the Kree Empire as seen in ''[[The Black Vortex]]'' storyline.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3 #25</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Hala the Accuser ended up on [[Knowhere]] where it orbited [[Battleworld]] following the final incursion that followed the incursions seen in the ''[[Time Runs Out]]'' storyline. She first appeared when the Guardians of Knowhere defeated [[Yotat the Destroyer]].<ref>''Guardians of Knowhere'' #3</ref> As Hala the Accuser spoke only Kree language, [[Gamora]] and the [[Angela (comics)|Angela]] that works for the Thor Corps had a hard time dealing with her when she attacked them. Hala the Accuser even defeated and slain many of the [[Nova Corps]] that were residing on Knowhere. Hala then killed the Thor Corps Angela before being defeated by Gamora with the help of [[Drax the Destroyer]] and [[Rocket Raccoon]].<ref>''Guardians of Knowhere'' #4</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' following [[Mister Fantastic]] rebuilding the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], Hala the Accuser went after Gamora and found her on Spartax.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 4 #1</ref> The [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] fought against Hala the Accuser. Even though [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] knocked Hala the Accuser unconscious, Drax the Destroyer unknowingly activated a failsafe in Hala the Accuser's Universal Weapon enabling her to regain conscious and gain the upper hand against the Guardians of the Galaxy. She then placed Emperor [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] in an escape pod so that he can watch Hala the Accuser destroy Spartax as she also plans to do the same thing to [[Earth]] as part of her revenge on his part for the near-genocide of the Kree.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> As Hala the Accuser continued wreaking havoc on Spartax, she defeats the Spartax [[Royal guard|Royal Guard]]s before she realized that the Guardians of the Galaxy retreated and regrouped. As Gamora sacrificed herself to confront Hala the Accuser, she bought the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy time for them to get away and rescue Peter Quill.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 4 #3</ref> Upon realizing that Peter Quill is no longer in her grasp, Hala the Accuser continued beating up Gamora in order to get the information on what she did with him. In the nick of time, the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy arrived in an attempt to talk Hala the Accuser out of destroying Spartax. When Hala doesn't give in to their plea, [[Kitty Pryde]] phased Hala the Accuser through the ground, Thing jumped from a high distance enough to knock out Hala the Accuser, and [[Flash Thompson|Venom]] broke her staff.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> During the attack by Yotat the Destroyer, Hala the Accuser was shown crawling through the sewers and was arrested by the Spartax Royal Guard when they found her. The Spartax Council decided to deport Hala the Accuser back to what remained of the Kree Empire.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 4 #5</ref>

Upon choosing either Gamora or Drax the Destroyer to accompany him, Star-Lord arrives on the Kree ship to confront Hala the Accuser who plans to use the Eternity Forge to resurrect her son Bal-Dinn and the entire Kree race as the Kree and their entire planet were destroyed by [[Thanos]]. This apparently will require numerous [[sacrifice]]s in the process. She critically wounds Peter with her [[lance]]. Rocket Raccoon manages to get the ship running to allow the two to escape from Hala the Accuser and Star-Lord manages to obtain the Eternity Forge back in the process which eventually heals him. In episode 2, Hala the Accuser pursues the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to obtain the Eternity Forge. After the Guardians of the Galaxy fight off a Kree ambush on the Milano, Hala the Accuser contacts Star-Lord telling him that he can't run forever and that the Eternity Forge will be hers. In episode 3, Hala the Accuser and her Kree forces catch up to the Guardians of the Galaxy and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] at the shrine on on the planet Dronbino at the time when Star-Lord is given the choice to either destroy the Eternity Forge or empower it. The choices Star-Lord makes will either have Hala the Accuser burned but empowered by its destruction or successfully reviving Bal-Dinn with plans to revive the dead Kree that are with her. In episode 4, the episode returned with either Hala burned and empowered, or managed to get the Eternity Forge, successfully reviving her son and the dead Kree. Then the shrine begins to collapse, while the Guardians fight off Hala and the Kree, the Guardians fall off the shrine, and Hala watch them fall. Later on after the Guardians escape the Shrine, Hala and the Kree started a violent attack on D’Bari V, killing millions to proceed to revive the rest of the dead Krees.
