The second Eel first appeared in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #92 (April 1983). 

===Fictional character biography===
Edward Lavell is first seen attempting to break [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] out of prison. Later working with Nightshade, the second Eel is defeated again by Iron Fist and reformed criminals Discus and Stilleto. 

The Eel is seen working with the criminals Blitz and the [[Vanisher]]<ref>''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #100</ref>. The trio is defeated by Spider-Man. Lavell also aids a group of villains attacking the Fantastic Four.

Lavell was a member of Justine Hammer's [[Masters of Evil]], and is defeated by the Thunderbolts. After the Masters of Evil are apprehended, Lavell was next seen participating in the Bloodsport tournament at [[Madripoor]]. There, he put on a poor showing. He is defeated by Toad, who seemingly crushes Lavell using his extremely long and powerful tongue. Lavell apparently survives.

He is briefly seen as a client for the law firm [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]]<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #6</ref>. He is discussing action to be taken against Power Man and refers to an 'Eel-Mobile'.

Eel is apprehended by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to serve in the so-called Thunderbolt Army. Following the disbanding of the Thunderbolt Army, Lavell has turned up as a member of a new Serpent Squad led by [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]], the daughter of the [[Red Skull]].

==Powers and abilities==
The Eel costume possessed devices capable of generating large and small bursts of electricity, though insulated to protect its user. It could fire electrical bolts (initially only through his suit's chest prod) and give off bright glows, as well as set up an electric current in the costume that would shock anyone touching it. The costume was coated with a greasy silicon substance (which was sometimes asbestos grease) that made it slippery. The costume could operate underwater. The Eel used various weapons, including a specially designed helicopter, an Aqua-Attractor gun, and an Eel-Cannon.
