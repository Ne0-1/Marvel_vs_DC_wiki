==Ken Hale==

===Fictional character biography===
'''Kenneth Hale'''  was a happy-go-lucky soldier of fortune. He was always risking his life for thrills, but he was actually afraid of dying. He heard of a local tribal legend from Africa that stated "If you kill the magical Gorilla-Man, you become immortal." Ken travelled to Africa to find the Gorilla-Man. Ken gave up on the idea at the last minute, but the ape forced him to shoot. Ken Hale then became immortal, but at the cost of becoming the new '''Gorilla-Man'''.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} After operating his own team for a while, Ken Hale then "retired", and lived in a large treehouse near the Congo. He served as a guide for the original [[X-Men]], and proved himself to be a formidable guide. He was given a special yearbook, and was acknowledged as an ally, or "X-Ape".<ref>X-Men First Class Vol. 1 #8</ref> After helping them on their mission, Ken presumably went on to live in the treehouse a while longer. He did use his powers when working with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],{{Issue|date=January 2010}} [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos unit]],{{Issue|date=January 2010}} and the [[Agents of Atlas]].

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Gorilla-Man and Human Robot rescue [[Namora]] from the [[Skrull]]s.<ref>Secret Invasion: Who Do You Trust #1</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
As Gorilla-Man, Hale possesses the body, and therefore the strength, agility, and endurance of a mountain gorilla, while still retaining his normal human intelligence. He is an expert in weapons usage with a preference for firearms, and was a skilled hand-to-hand fighter even as a human being. Gorilla-Man also has been cursed with immortality, thus he does not age and has retained the same level of strength and physical prowess over decades.

===Other versions===
*In an alternate Earth that appeared in ''Avengers Forever'' #4-5, a similar version of Hale as Gorilla-Man appeared in the Avengers of the 1950s. However their timeline was destroyed by [[Immortus]].
