===Fictional character biography===
'''Kenneth Hale'''  was a happy-go-lucky soldier of fortune. He was always risking his life for thrills, but he was actually afraid of dying. He heard of a local tribal legend from Africa that stated "If you kill the magical Gorilla-Man, you become immortal." Ken travelled to Africa to find the Gorilla-Man. Ken gave up on the idea at the last minute, but the ape forced him to shoot. Ken Hale then became immortal, but at the cost of becoming the new '''Gorilla-Man'''. After operating his own team for a while, Ken Hale then "retired", and lived in a large treehouse near Congo. He served as a guide for the original [[X-Men]], and proved himself to be a formidable guide. He was given a special yearbook, and was acknowledged as an ally, or "X-Ape". After helping them on their mission, Ken presumably went on to live in the treehouse a while longer. He did use his powers when working with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos unit]] and the [[Agents of Atlas]].

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Gorilla-Man and Human Robot rescue [[Namora]] from the [[Skrull]]s.<ref>Secret Invasion: Who Do You Trust #1</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
As Gorilla-Man, Hale possesses the abilities that the average gorilla has, including increased strength, agility, endurance, and more, while still retaining normal human intelligence. Gorilla-Man also has cursed immortality. He has also shown some immunity to the effects of a cave of despair, a temple in some area in Africa. All his abilities come from a curse, and his condition supposedly can't be removed by scientific means.

===Other versions===
*In an alternate Earth that appeared in ''Avengers Forever'' #4-5, a similar version of Hale as Gorilla-Man appeared in the Avengers of the 1950's. However their timeline was destroyed by [[Immortus]].
*On Earth-O-Men, '''Ken Hale''' appeared as the Gorilla Man on an Earth dominated by the alien race known as the [[Skrulls]]. This version appeared in ''Paradise X: Heralds'' #3.
