'''Damage Control''' is a fictional [[construction]] company appearing in [[Marvel Comics]] which specializes in repairing the property damage caused by conflicts between [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain|super-villain]]s.  Three ''Damage Control'' limited series have been published to date.

==Publication history==
Damage Control employees first appear briefly in a four-page story in 1988's ''Marvel Age Annual'' and fully in 1989 in a serialized story published in the [[anthology]] comic ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #19 (although they are posited to have existed since the earliest days of widespread superhero-related property damage). Subsequently, the employees of Damage Control have been the subject of three separate [[comic book]] [[limited series]] (each limited to four issues), published between 1989 and 1991, and have had frequent minor roles in many other Marvel comics.

[[Dwayne McDuffie]], who co-created the concept with artist [[Ernie Colon]] and wrote Damage Control's initial non-adventures, has often described ''Damage Control'' as "a [[sitcom]] within the Marvel Universe". {{cn}}

==Fictional history==
Damage Control was founded by Ms. Ann-Marie Hoag and was originally owned by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], each owning half the stock of the company, though Stark felt uneasy cooperating with Fisk, a notorious criminal. 

When Ms. Hoag was offered a job in government, she nominated Robin Chapel as her replacement. Stark and Fisk sold their stock in Damage Control: Stark because he didn't want to be associated with Fisk and Fisk because he had no confidence in Robin's ability to lead the company. Another company, Carlton Co, took control of Damage Control and tried to make Damage Control more profitable, but in the process angered a lot of employees and nearly ruined Damage Control. Ms. Hoag convinced [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to invest in Damage Control and they loaned her the money to buy back the company. S.H.I.E.L.D. also found out that the sale of Damage Control had been a plot by Fisk to buy back the company for cheap. During the events of [[Acts of Vengeance]] (an event Fisk helped organize), massive damage was done to the city and Fisk made a large profit when Damage Control was hired to repair the damages.

In a later appearance, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is seen helping Damage Control to clear up the damage after a battle in New York CIty.

===Civil War===
{{spoiler}}
Damage Control appears again in ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' Vol. 3, #46 (September 2006), as part of Marvel's ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event.  

In Wolverine Vol. 3, #45, the super-villain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] reveals that a "Walter Declun" is in some way behind the explosion that led to the deaths of 600 people in Stamford, Connecticut, having provided Nitro with MGH ([[Mutant Growth Hormone]]) in order to enhance his powers. Declun is identified by [[Namor (comics)|Namor]] as CEO of Damage Control, Inc.

Wolverine's investigation leads him to interrogate Anne-Marie Hoag, Damage Control's President, who reveals that Declun and his investors took a controlling share of the stock after the company went public to obtain more funds. Following the Stamford disaster, Damage Control obtained the town's reconstruction contract, as well as a contract to perform the evaluation and training of registered super-humans.

In his search for Declun, Wolverine engages in a fight with Damage Control guards, who are equipped with Mandroid Armor, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weaponry, [[Stark Enterprises]] technology and other weapons and equipment salvaged from superhuman fights.
