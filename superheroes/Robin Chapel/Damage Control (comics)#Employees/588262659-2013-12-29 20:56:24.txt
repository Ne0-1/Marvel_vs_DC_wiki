'''Damage Control''' is a fictional [[construction]] company appearing in [[Marvel Comics]], which specializes in repairing the property damage caused by conflicts between [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s.  Four ''Damage Control'' limited series have been published to date.

==Publication history==
Damage Control employees first appear briefly in a four-page story in 1988's ''Marvel Age Annual'' and fully in 1989 in a serialized story published in the [[anthology]] comic ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #19. Subsequently, the employees of Damage Control have been the subject of three separate [[comic book]] [[limited series]] (each limited to four issues), published between 1989 and 1991, and have had frequent minor roles in many other Marvel comics including an important role in the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''; as well, the first issue of ''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control'', a three-issue limited series tying in to ''[[World War Hulk]]'', was published in January 2008.

[[Dwayne McDuffie]], who co-created the concept with artist [[Ernie Colón]] and wrote Damage Control's initial non-adventures, pitched ''Damage Control'' to Marvel as "a [[situation comedy|sitcom]] within the Marvel Universe".<ref>http://homepage.mac.com/dmcduffie/site/Damconpitch.html Dwayne McDuffie's original pitch to Marvel Comics</ref>

Damage Control received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #2.

==Fictional biography==
Damage Control was founded by Ms. Ann-Marie Hoag and was originally owned by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], each owning half the stock of the company, though Stark felt uneasy cooperating with Fisk, a notorious criminal. The company was headquartered in New York's [[Flatiron Building]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 34–35  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>

Damage Control employees have been in the middle of a breakout at the Vault, confronted Doctor Doom, have been threatened with death by the [[Punisher]] and have met vastly powerful cosmic entities such as the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Galactus]]. They have "fought" side by side with the [[X-Men]], socialized with the [[New Warriors]] and were even almost menaced by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].

When Ms. Hoag was offered a job in government, she nominated Robin Chapel as her replacement. Stark and Fisk sold their stock in Damage Control: Stark because he did not want to be associated with Fisk and Fisk because he had no confidence in Robin's ability to lead the company. Another company, Carlton Co, took control of Damage Control and tried to make Damage Control more profitable, but in the process angered a lot of employees and nearly ruined Damage Control. Ms. Hoag convinced [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to invest in Damage Control and they loaned her the money to buy back the company. S.H.I.E.L.D. also found out that the sale of Damage Control had been a plot by Fisk to buy back the company for cheap. During the events of [[Acts of Vengeance]] (an event Fisk helped organize), massive damage was done to the city and Fisk made a large profit when Damage Control was hired to repair the damages.

===Damage Control: The Movie===
The confrontation with the Kingpin causes unexpected results. The Damage Control staff find that a movie has been put out, a fictionalized version of their confrontation with the Kingpin. At the wrap party for the premiere, the Damage Control staff is summoned by the [[Silver Surfer]] to help deal with Edifice Rex, a former employee. He had gained cosmic powers and this, combined with an anal-retentive personality {{Citation Needed|date=June 2013}}, threatens the cosmos. Several of the employees meet and discuss the problem with other cosmic entities, such as [[Galactus]] and Lord Chaos. Robin Chapel eventually solves this problem by firing Rex.

===Post-series work===
After a super-fight destroys the [[Washington Monument]]<ref>''X-Factor'' #74 (Jan. 1, 1992)</ref> Damage Control is contracted and fixes the damage off-panel. Their bill is seen in a pile of paperwork.<ref>''X-Factor'' Annual #7 (1992)</ref>

[[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] is seen working with Damage Control, on one occasion serving a [[community service]] sentence levied as punishment for a drunken rampage. Hercules becomes a full-fledged employee, forced to earn a living after the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] successfully sues the demigod for injuries incurred in his apprehension.

===Corruption at the top===
Damage Control is seen during the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' Vol. 3, #46 (September 2006)</ref>  The super-villain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], who blew up the town of Stamford, killing hundreds and starting the Civil War, reveals that a "Walter Declun", has provided him with [[Mutant Growth Hormone (comics)|Mutant Growth Hormone]]. Via Namor, Wolverine learns Walter is the CEO of Damage Control, Inc.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #45</ref> A brief scene shows that Walter and one other employee of the firm are complicit in using Nitro to boost the firm's profits.

This leads Wolverine to Anne-Marie Hoag, Damage Control's President (and a brief confrontation with Ann, long-time D.C. receptionist). Anne-Marie reveals that Declun and his investors took a controlling share of the stock after the company went public to obtain more funds. D.C. has also obtained the Stamford reconstruction contract and the contract to train and evaluate registered super-beings. Anne-Marie has suspected Declun of illegal activities but did not have strong enough evidence to counter his ties with Washington D.C. and the President.

In his battle against Declun and Damage Control, which includes destroying many D.C. assets such as company equipment to robbing overseas banks with D.C. Holdings to forcing major stock holders to liquidate their stock. Wolverine later engages in a fight with a team of D.C. Security personnel who are equipped with Mandroid Armor, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weaponry, [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]] technology and other items salvaged from superhuman fights until the super-hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] shows up and captures Wolverine, who is then delivered to SHIELD, which is under Maria Hill's leadership. But Wolverine later escapes. After making his way back to Damage Control offices, he confronts Declun, at which point the corrupt businessman takes a dose of Mutant Growth Hormone in response to Wolverine's threats; temporally giving him super-human powers. During the fight Wolverine appears to kill Declun by stabbing him through his eye sockets. However, Declun survives the fight.{{Volume needed|date=July 2009}}

===World War Hulk===
John Porter also becomes involved with the Civil War.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #542</ref> When FF members Susan and Reed Richards temporarily separate over ethical differences, their emotional split-up was punctuated by Susan using her force fields to punch a three foot circular hole through every floor of the building. Porter then shows up and estimates the repairs will be $789,000. He also thanks Reed for the work as lately. 

The company helped clean up New York City after the events of ''[[World War Hulk]]''.<ref>''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control'' #1–3 (March 2008)</ref> [[Goliath (Tom Foster)|Tom Foster]], the nephew of the late [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] and the new Goliath, joins the company, as do fellow superhumans [[Monstro (comics)|Monstro]] and Visioneer. The undamaged [[Flatiron Building]] is once again used as their headquarters. As a company, Damage Control secures all relevant resources and a makeshift superhero rescue force, as many people were left behind when New York was evacuated for the events of 'World War Hulk'. Damage Control also collects various extraordinary resources left behind from the confrontation, such as the [[adamantium]] "bullets", an alien A.I. and alien metals.

During the reconstruction, a strange side-effect of one of the Hulk's destroyed machines causes the [[Chrysler Building]] to come to life.  It wants to leave the city and see the world, but John Porter is able to negotiate a deal by which it is allowed to leave one month a year; as John notes, no one comes to Manhattan in August.

The company again gets the bid to rebuild [[Avengers Mansion]] just as a new team, led by [[Luke Cage]], is moving in. Ms. Hoag hints at a secret past with Cage.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 (August 2010)</ref>
