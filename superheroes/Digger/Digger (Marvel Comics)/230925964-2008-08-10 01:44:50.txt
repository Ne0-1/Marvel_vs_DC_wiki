==Publication history==
Originally designed as one of the hosts of ''Tower of Shadows'' and its sister title, ''[[Chamber of Darkness]]'', both beginning in 1969, Digger played a role similar to that of ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' 's [[Crypt Keeper]] of the 1950s [[EC Comics]] and later [[HBO]] [[television series]].<ref name="multiple">Janson, Tim [http://www.mania.com/dead-night-featuring-manthing-1_article_57468.html Mania Comics: "Comic Review: ''Dead of Night Featuring Man-Thing'' #1]</ref> Providing a panel or two of introductory material leading into and usually closing the story itself, Digger appeared sporadically through the nine-issue run of ''Tower of Shadows'' and the eight-issue run of ''Chamber of Darkness''.

Digger returned with other lesser-known characters in ''[[Captain America]]'' #329 (May 1987). He appeared with these other characters as a member of the team the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]], supervillain antagonists who primarily appeared the series ''[[West Coast Avengers|Avengers West Coast]]'' during the 1990s.
