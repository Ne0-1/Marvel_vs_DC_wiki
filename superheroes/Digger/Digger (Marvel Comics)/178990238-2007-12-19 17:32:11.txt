'''Digger''' ('''Roderick Krupp''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He [[first appeared]] as a story narrator/host  in the [[horror fiction|horror]] [[anthology]] series  ''[[Tower of Shadows]]'' #1 (Sept. 1969), in the story "At the Stroke of Midnight" by writer-artist [[Jim Steranko]].<!--we don't know if Steranko created him, only that Digger appeared in the first story of that issue; Stan Lee & John Romita may have designed him, and Steranko's story just happened to lead off the issue-->

==Publication history==
Originally designed as one of the hosts of ''Tower of Shadows'' and its sister title, ''[[Chamber of Darkness]]'', both beginning in 1969, Digger played a role similar to that of ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' 's [[Crypt Keeper]] of the 1950s [[EC Comics]] and later [[HBO]] [[television series]]. Providing a panel or two of introductory material leading into and usually closing the story itself, Digger appeared sporadically through the nine-issue run of ''Tower of Shadows'' and the eight-issue run of ''Chamber of Darkness''.

Digger returned with other lesser-known characters in ''[[Captain America]]'' #329 (May 1987).

==Fictional character biography==
Roderick Krupp, a [[serial killer]] who buried his victims alive while telling them macabre stories, became known as Digger for his [[modus operandi ]]. Living in a decrepit [[Los Angeles, California]] mansion known as the Tower of Shadows, he was eventually contacted by the vigilante the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] and recruited for the [[supervillain]] team the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]]. The team made the mansion its headquarters. Krupp was eventually apprehended by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] of the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Although Marvel.com gives Digger's skin colour as officially green, throughout the character's existence a certain number of panels &mdash; and the Marvel.com image itself &mdash; have seen him coloured blue.

==Powers and abilities==
Digger has a slightly superhuman level of strength.
