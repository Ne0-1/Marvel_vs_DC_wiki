The post-Crisis version of Larry Lance remains largely unchanged, with minor alterations such as now being the husband to the first Black Canary and father to the second. in ''Birds of Prey'' #66 (June 2004) it is revealed that Larry befriended [[Commissioner Gordon|Jim Gordon]] in the past, while working together on the Gotham police force. They were both growing concerned over the influence of Mafia figures on Gotham society, such as the [[Carmine Falcone|Falcones]] and [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Bertinellis]]. This conversation happened at a society event which was interrupted by a serial killer later dubbed 'The Blonde Slasher', who left a victim for Larry and his wife to find. Many years later, Larry's daughter caught the man. It was the great-grandfather of Lian Harper, the unrelated child Larry's daughter was raising.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #66=67 (Juneâ€“July 2004)</ref>
