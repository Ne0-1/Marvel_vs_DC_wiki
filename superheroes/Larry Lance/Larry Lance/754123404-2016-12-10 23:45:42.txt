'''Larry Lance''' is a [[DC Comics]] character, associated with the [[superhero]]ine [[Black Canary]], a detective who was father to Black Canary. His first appearance was in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #92 (February 1948), created by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Robert Kanigher]]. When the Black Canary was reimagined in the mid-1980s as two characters&mdash;a mother and daughter&mdash;Larry became the husband to the elder Black Canary and father to the younger superheroine. [[Paul Blackthorne]] portrays a version of the character, named '''Quentin Larry Lance''', in the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.

Following DC's [[The New 52]] reboot in 2011, Larry Lance was re-established as '''Kurt Lance''', the husband of [[Black Canary|Dinah Drake]] formerly affiliated with [[Team 7]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Larry Lance===
Larry Lance's original appearances pertained to being a civilian love interest for Dinah Drake (Black Canary's alter ego), a male "damsel in distress", and occasionally as a crime fighting partner and capable detective to Black Canary; a dynamic of equality similar to the relationships between [[Steve Trevor]] and [[Wonder Woman]] or [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] and [[Aquaman]]. Larry and Dinah later married and had a daughter.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book| last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Black Canary | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 50 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

In ''Justice League of America'' #73 (August 1969), Larry plays a larger role as he tends to [[Starman (Ted Knight)|Starman]] after the hero is wounded in a battle with a cosmic powered villain called [[Aquarius (DC Comics)|Aquarius]]. After a universe spanning battle in ''Justice League of America'' #74 Larry sacrifices himself to save his wife from a blast of cosmic energy directed at her by Aquarius. After his funeral Black Canary decides to migrate from [[Earth-Two]] to [[Earth-One]] with the former universe reminding her too much of her lost husband.<ref>Justice League of America #74 (September 1969)</ref>

Black Canary, feeling lonely, tries to strike up a romance with the Larry of Earth-One. However, he turns out to be a fixer for the Gotham mob, '''The Collector'''. He takes care of difficult situations; his reputation rides on being able to provide a tidy profit for all concerned in the end. He manipulated Black Canary, and died while trying to assassinate Batman at the horse races.<ref>"Brave and the Bold" Sept. #91 (1970)</ref>

===Post Crisis===
The post-Crisis version of Larry Lance remains largely unchanged, with minor alterations such as now being the husband to the first Black Canary and father to the second. in ''Birds of Prey'' #66 (June 2004) it is revealed that Larry befriended [[Commissioner Gordon|Jim Gordon]] in the past, while working together on the Gotham police force. They were both growing concerned over the influence of Mafia figures on Gotham society, such as the [[Carmine Falcone|Falcones]] and [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Bertinellis]]. This conversation happened at a society event which was interrupted by a serial killer later dubbed 'The Blonde Slasher', who left a victim for Larry and his wife to find. Many years later, Larry's daughter caught the man. It was the great-grandfather of Lian Harper, the unrelated child Larry's daughter was raising.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #66–67 (June–July 2004)</ref>

Meanwhile, in ''Teen Titans'' #8 (June 2012) a member of [[Amanda Waller]]'s task force known as [[Team 7]] is revealed to be Kurt Lance, alive and well, working deep undercover.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #8 (June 2012)</ref>  Starting in ''Team 7'' #1 (November 2012) the events before his "death" are detailed, working as a government operative for Team 7 alongside [[Amanda Waller]], [[Deathstroke]], and the Black Canary (then going by her maiden name, Dinah Drake).<ref>''Team 7'' #1 (November 2012)</ref>
