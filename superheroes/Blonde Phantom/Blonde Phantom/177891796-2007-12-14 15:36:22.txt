'''The Blonde Phantom''' ('''Louise Grant Mason''') is a [[fictional characters|fictional]] masked crimefighter in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] who [[first appeared]] during the [[1940s]] period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. She was created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Syd Shores]] for [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]], in ''[[All-Select Comics]]'' #11 (Fall 1946).

==Publication history==
As [[superhero]]es began to fade out of fashion in the post-war era, [[comic book]] [[publishers]] scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant super-heroines since [[Wonder Woman]] (created for one of [[DC Comics]]' predecessors, [[All-American Publications]]). These new female leads would include Timely's [[Golden Girl]], [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], [[Namora]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel comics)|Sun Girl]], and [[Venus (comics)|Venus]], and its [[teen]]-[[humor]] star [[Millie the Model]]; [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]]' revival of [[Quality Comics]]' [[Phantom Lady]]; and DC's [[Black Canary]].

''All Select Comics'' became ''Blonde Phantom Comics'' the following issue. The series lasted a little over two years (from #12-22, Winter 1946 to March 1949), during which time the lissome and evidently very popular crime-fighter also appeared as a backup feature in:
<br><br>
*''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #84-91 (Oct. 1947 - April 1949)
* ''All Winners Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1948)
* ''[[Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner Comics]]'' #25-28 & 30 (Spring - Oct. 1948 & Feb. 1949)
* all three issues of ''[[Blackstone the Magician]]'' (#2-4, May-Sept. 1948)
* ''Namora'' #2 (Oct. 1948)
* ''Sun Girl'' #2-3 (Oct.-Dec. 1948). 
<br>
The character was the province of no one artist, and aside from originator Shores, her adventures in this wide variety of comics were pencilled by [[Vince Alascia]], [[Ken Bald]], [[Allen Bellman]], [[Carl Burgos]], [[Vernon Henkel]], [[Mike Sekowsky]], [[Ed Winiarski]], the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas]], and others. When the pencilers weren't inking themselves, their embellishers included [[Al Avison]], [[Jack Binder]], and [[Harry Sahle]].

''Blonde Phantom Comics'' changed titles and formats completely to become the [[anthology|anthological]] [[romantic fiction|romance]] comic ''Lovers'' with issue #23 (May 1949).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin and Golden Age adventures===
Louise Grant, born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], was secretary to [[private detective]] Mark Mason. Enamored with her boss and wanting to help him break cases, she surreptitiously donned a black domino [[mask]] and a sexy, skintight, slit-leg red [[evening gown]] and [[shoes|high heels]], and ventured out at night fighting crime. Highly athletic and seemingly trained in [[martial arts]], the Blonde Phantom also carried a .45 caliber pistol. In a distaff echo of [[Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]], Mason had a crush on the Blonde Phantom, but not on Louise.
<!--Please find a comics historian actually noting this: The footnote is only to the issue of Millie the Model, not to a supporting quote
Comics historians have noted that, as the Blonde Phantom had no specific origin story, Louise Grant may have been inspired by [[Marvel Universe|Marvel-universe]] [[model (person)|model]] [[Millie the Model|Millie]] Collins, who appeared at a fancy-dress ball as a masked mystery woman called the Blonde Phantom, in a publicity stunt for General Cosmetics<ref>''Millie the Model'' #2 (Oct. 1946)</ref>.

===Modern Age===
Louise was next seen working as a legal secretary for District Attorney Blake Tower<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #4 (July 1989)</ref>.  Now widowed, Louise Grant Mason, having left crime-fighting to marry Mark in 1949 and give birth to their daughter Wanda and later son Earl, was generally the voice-of-reason for [[She-Hulk]] and [[Blake Tower]]. 

Louise would often find herself more or less willingly pulled into the She-Hulk's surreal adventures, and occasionally vice-versa. They would confront many menaces, from [[Stilt-Man]]<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> to a town where stepping out of line, even swearing, was fatally punished. Louise brought members of the Hill People to help She-Hulk defeat [[Spragg]], but was then taken prisoner by the [[Mole Man]] and rejuvenated by unusual [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranean]] diamonds.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #31-33</ref> She was captured by the [[Black Talon (comics)#Black Talon II|Black Talon]] and his "X-Humed", but was rescued by She-Hulk.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #34-35</ref>

She would even venture into space, side by side with the She-Hulk. The pair would become allies of the space-faring hero [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]] and his friends [[Ulysses Solomon Archer|U.S. Archer]] and Al the alien. Louise helped She-Hulk against Spragg again,<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #40-42</ref> and saved She-Hulk from [[Xemnu|Xemnu the Titan]]'s revenge.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #43</ref>

Louise, affectionately nicknamed "Weezi", began a romantic relationship with Jennifer's father, Morris Walters.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #36</ref> She saw daughter Wanda become the costumed crime-fighter the Phantom Blonde. She ended up trading physical stature and powers with a none-too pleased Jennifer. Weezi became enamored with her new form and abilities, only changing back when Morris revealed he wanted Weezi the way she had been. Even so, after being kidnapped by the [[Mole Man]], she was exposed to a revivifying liquid that restored her body to that of her Golden Age self. In addition, it was revealed that the Blonde Phantom had an adventure with superhero team, the [[All-Winners Squad]]<!--hyphen OK-->, in a flashback set after the events of (the unhyphenated) ''All Winners Comics'' #21 (Winter 1946/47). <!--Louise also appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #325 (Oct. 1990) and ''The Incredible Hulk Annual'' #16 (1990).-->

==Powers and abilities==
The Blonde Phantom had no superhuman powers.  She was an athletic woman, and a fine markswoman with the conventional handgun she carried.  She also had excellent secretarial skills, as the secretary for the Mark Mason Detective Agency, and later as the secretary of New York City District Attorney Blake Tower.

===Phantom Blonde (Wanda Grant)===
Louise's daughter, Wanda Louise Mason Grant, briefly followed her mother's crime-fighter legacy, becoming the Phantom Blonde<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #23 (Jan. 1991)</ref> and later being considered a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''</ref>

Phantom Blonde was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Buzz Dixon]].
