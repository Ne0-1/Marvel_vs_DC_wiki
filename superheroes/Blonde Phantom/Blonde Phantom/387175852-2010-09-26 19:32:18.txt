'''The Blonde Phantom''' ('''Louise Grant Mason''') is a [[fiction]]al masked crimefighter in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Syd Shores]] for Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]], she [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[All Select Comics]]'' #11 (Fall 1946), during the 1940s period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

==Publication history==
As [[superhero]]es began to fade out of fashion in the post-war era, [[comic book]] [[publishers]] scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroines]] since [[Wonder Woman]]. These new female leads would include Timely's [[Golden Girl]], [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], [[Namora]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]], and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], and its [[adolescence|teen]]-[[humour|humor]] star [[Millie the Model]]; [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]]' revival of [[Quality Comics]]' [[Phantom Lady]]; and DC's [[Black Canary]].

The Blonde Phantom debuted in ''All Select Comics'' which became ''Blonde Phantom Comics'' the following issue. The series lasted a little over two years (from #12-22, Winter 1946 to March 1949), during which time the crimefighter also appeared as a backup feature in:
<blockquote>
*''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #84-91 (Oct. 1947 - April 1949)
* ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1948)
* ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner Comics]]'' #25-28 & 30 (Spring - Oct. 1948 & Feb. 1949)
* all three issues of ''[[Blackstone, the Magic Detective|Blackstone the Magician]]'' (#2-4, May-Sept. 1948)
* ''[[Namora]]'' #2 (Oct. 1948)
* ''[[Sun Girl (Marvel Comics)|Sun Girl]]'' #2-3 (Oct.-Dec. 1948).
</blockquote>
The character was the province of no one artist, and aside from originator Shores, her adventures in this wide variety of comics were [[penciller|pencilled]] by [[Vince Alascia]], [[Ken Bald]], Allen Bellman, [[Carl Burgos]], Vernon Henkel, [[Mike Sekowsky]], [[Ed Winiarski]], the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]], and others. When not [[inker|inking]] themselves, the pencilers were embellished by inkers including [[Al Avison]], [[Jack Binder (comics)|Jack Binder]], and [[Harry Sahle]].

''Blonde Phantom Comics'' changed titles and formats completely to become the [[anthology|anthological]] [[Romance comics in the United States (1946â€“1975)|romance]] comic ''Lovers'' with issue #23 (May 1949).

===Concurrent Blonde Phantom===
Comics historian [[Jess Nevins]] notes that the Timely Comics teen-humor character [[Millie the Model|Millie Collins]] wore a mask and veil and posed as the "Blonde Phantom" for a [[cosmetics]] company's publicity campaign in a story in ''Millie the Model'' #2 (Oct. 1946), published near the same time as the superheroine Blonde Phantom's debut in ''All-Select Comics'' #11 (Fall 1946). Acknowledging the shared [[Marvel Universe]], Nevins writes that the famous model's stunt "perhaps inspired Louise Grant to put on a costume and fight crime".<ref>[http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/phantom.html The Blonde Phantom (I)"] at [[Jess Nevins|Nevins, Jess]], [http://www.reocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/gaguide.html A Guide to Golden Age Marvel Characters].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin and Golden Age adventures===
[[Image:AllWinners1-1948.jpg|thumb|left|''All Winners Comics'' vol. 2, #1 (Aug. 1948), cover artist(s) unknown]]
Louise Grant, born in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], was secretary to [[private investigator|private detective]] Mark Mason. Enamored with her boss and wanting to help him break cases, she surreptitiously donned a black [[domino mask]] and a sexy, skintight, slit-leg red [[evening gown]] and [[high-heeled footwear|high heels]], and ventured out at night fighting crime. Highly athletic and seemingly trained in [[martial arts]], the Blonde Phantom also carried a .45 caliber pistol. In a distaff echo of [[Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]], Mason had a crush on the Blonde Phantom, but not on Louise. Eventually, Grant and Mason married.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} At an unspecified point, the Blonde Phantom fought alongside the [[All-Winners Squad]]<!--hyphen OK--> superhero team for an adventure.<ref>[http://www.marveldirectory.com/groupsandteams/allwinners.htm All-Winners Squad] at MarvelDirectory.com, reprinted from '' The Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe: Teams 2005''</ref>

===Modern Age===
Louise Grant Mason had left crimefighting to marry her employer, Mark Mason, in 1949 and give birth to their daughter Wanda and, later, to son Earl. After Mason's death, she began working as a legal secretary for [[district attorney]] Blake Tower.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #4 (July 1989)</ref>, and became the general voice-of-reason for both Tower and [[She-Hulk]].

Mason would often find herself more or less willingly pulled into the She-Hulk's surreal adventures, and occasionally vice-versa. They would confront many menaces, from [[Stilt-Man]]<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #4</ref> to a town where stepping out of line, even swearing, was fatally punished. Mason would accompany She-Hulk into outer space, where the pair become allies of the space-faring hero [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]] and his compatriots U.S. Archer and Al the alien.

Mason, affectionately nicknamed "Weezi", began a romantic relationship with Jennifer's father, Morris Walters.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #36</ref> She also saw her daughter Wanda become the costumed crimefighter the Phantom Blonde. Mason later found herself trading physical stature and powers with a none-too-pleased Jennifer, becoming so enamored with her new form and abilities that she only changed back when Morris revealed he wanted Weezi the way she had been.

After being taken prisoner by the subterranean ruler the [[Mole Man]], she was restored to her youthful adult self by <!--article contradictorily gave both "unusual diamonds" and "revivifying liquid" as the cause--> technology from the underground realm [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #31-33</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Blonde Phantom had no superhuman powers.  She was an athletic woman, and a fine markswoman with the conventional handgun she carried.  She also had excellent secretarial skills, as the secretary for the Mark Mason Detective Agency, and later as the secretary of New York City District Attorney Blake Tower.

==Phantom Blonde (Wanda Grant)==
Louise's daughter, Wanda Louise Mason Grant, briefly followed her mother's crime-fighter legacy, becoming the Phantom Blonde<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #23 (Jan. 1991)</ref> and later being considered a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''</ref>

Phantom Blonde was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and Buzz Dixon.

==Other versions==
The Louise Mason version of Blonde Phantom appears as a recurring character in ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' and its sequel, ''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'', both published in the young-readers [[Marvel Adventures]] [[imprint]], taking place in a non-canonical [[alternate reality]] from mainstream Marvel continuity. Here, she is portrayed as a famed private detective who often works as a confidant to [[Spider-Man]] and his girlfriend [[Sophia "Chat" Sanduval]].<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #58</ref>
