'''The Blonde Phantom (Louise Grant Mason)''' is a [[fictional characters|fictional]] masked crimefighter from the [[1940s]] [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], created by [[writer]]-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Syd Shores]] for [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]], in ''All-Select Comics'' #11 (Fall 1946).

==Publishing history==
As [[superhero]]es began to fade out of fashion in the post-war era, [[comic book]] [[publishers]] scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant superheroines since [[Wonder Woman]] (created for one of [[DC Comics]]' predecessors, [[All-American Publications]]). These new female leads would include Timely's [[Golden Girl]], [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], [[Namora]], [[Sun Girl (Marvel comics)|Sun Girl]], and [[Venus (comics)|Venus]], and its [[teen]]-[[humor]] star [[Millie the Model]]; [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox Comics]]' revival of [[Quality Comics]]' [[Phantom Lady]]; and DC's [[Black Canary]].

''All Select Comics'' became ''Blonde Phantom Comics'' the following issue. The series lasted a little over two years (from #12-22, Winter 1946 to March 1949), during which time the lissome and evidently very popular crimefighter also appeared as a backup feature in:
<br><br>
*''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #84-91 (Oct. 1947 - April 1949)
* ''All Winners Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1948)
* ''[[Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner Comics]]'' #25-28 & 30 (Spring - Oct. 1948 & Feb. 1949)
* all three issues of ''[[Blackstone the Magician]]'' (#2-4, May-Sept. 1948)
* ''Namora'' #2 (Oct. 1948)
* ''Sun Girl'' #2-3 (Oct.-Dec. 1948). 
<br>
The character was the province of no one artist, and aside from originator Shores, her adventures in this wide variety of comics were pencilled by [[Vince Alascia]], [[Ken Bald]], [[Allen Bellman]], [[Carl Burgos]], [[Vernon Henkel]], [[Mike Sekowsky]], [[Ed Winiarski]], the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas]], and others. When the pencilers weren't inking themselves, their embellishers included [[Al Avison]], [[Jack Binder]], and [[Harry Sahle]].

''Blonde Phantom Comics'' changed titles and formats completely to become the [[anthology|anthological]] [[romantic fiction|romance]] comic ''Lovers'' with issue #23 (May 1949).

==Character biography==
The Blonde Phantom was Louise Grant, secretary to [[private detective]] Mark Mason. Enamored with her boss and wanting to help him break cases, she surreptitiously donned a black domino [[mask]] and a sexy, skintight, slit-leg red [[evening gown]] and [[shoes|high heels]], and ventured out at night fighting crime. Highly athletic and seemingly trained in [[martial arts]], the Blonde Phantom also carried a .45 caliber [[pistol]]. In a distaff echo of [[Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]], Mason had a crush on the Blonde Phantom, but not on Louise.

Comics historians have noted that, as the Blonde Phantom had no specific origin story, Louise Grant may have been inspired by [[Marvel Universe|Marvel-universe]] [[model (person)|model]] Millie Collins, who appeared at a fancy-dress ball as a masked mystery woman called the Blonde Phantom, in a publicity stunt for General Cosmetics<ref>''[[Millie the Model]]'' #2 (Oct. [[1946]])</ref>.

Louise returned in the modern age in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #4 (July 1989), in which characters self-reflexively were aware they in a comic book and often broke the [[fourth wall]] to address the reader directly. Now the widowed Louise Grant Mason — having left crimefighting to marry Mark in 1949 and give birth to their daughter, Wanda — she was the book's generally voice-of-reason supporting character. Secretary to [[District Attorney]] Blake Tower, for whom lawyer Jennifer Walters, publicly known as the [[She-Hulk]], worked, the former Blonde Phantom would find herself more or less willingly pulled into the She-Hulk's surreal adventures, and occasionally vice-versa. The return of a [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]]
character in issue #4 is an homage to ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #4, in which the Golden Age [[Captain America]] returns, and ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' #4, in which the [[Sub-Mariner]] returns.

During the course of ''She-Hulk'', Louise — affectionately nicknamed "Weezi" — began a romantic relationship with Jennifer's father, Morris Walters; saw daughter Wanda become the costumed crimefighter the Phantom Blonde; exchanged bodies with a none-too-pleased Jennifer; and, after being kidnapped by the [[Mole Man]], was exposed to a revivifying liquid that restored her body to that of her Golden Age self. In addition, issue #22 (Dec. 1990) [[retconned]] the Blonde Phantom as having had an adventure with Timely's post-war superhero team, the [[All-Winners Squad]]<!--hyphen OK-->, in a flashback set after the events of (the unhyphenated) ''All Winners Comics'' #21 (Winter 1946/47). <!--Louise also appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #325 (Oct. 1990) and ''The Incredible Hulk Annual'' #16 (1990).--> Louise's daughter, Wanda Grant, briefly followed her mother's crimefighter legacy, becoming the Phantom Blonde in issue #23 (Jan. 1991).
