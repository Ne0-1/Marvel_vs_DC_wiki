The Marvel Comics superhero '''Spirit of '76''' ('''William Naslund''') [[first appeared]] in ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #14 (March 1977), and was created by [[writer]] [[Roy Thomas]] and [[artist]] [[Frank Robbins]] as part of a [[World War II]]-era [[superhero]] team, the [[Crusaders (comics)#Marvel Crusaders|Crusaders]], patterned on the DC group the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]. The Spirit of '76 was the equivalent of Freedom Fighters member [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]], originally a [[Quality Comics]] character.<ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/capamer1.htm International Hero: "Captain America (Spirit of '76)"]</ref>

==Publication history==
Marvel's Spirit of '76 appeared as a member of the short-lived superhero team the Crusaders in ''The Invaders'' #14-15 (March-April 1977). In a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] portion of a story in issue  #4 (Aug. 1977) of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate-universe]] series ''[[What If? (comics)|What If?]]'', Naslund succeeds Steve Rogers as Captain America, the first of three official replacements until Rogers resumed the role years later. This [[retcon]] became necessary after Marvel's conflicting accounts of Captain America in 1950s and 1960s comics had created a discrepancy.

==Fictional character biography==
William Naslund was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  An athletic young man, hoping to help the Allies' World War II efforts in a unique way, he develops exceptional fighting skills and learns to copy some of moves Captain America employed with the discus-like shield that the superhero carried. He is recruited by a mysterious man called "Alfie"  to become a costumed hero in the new team the [[Crusaders (comics)#Marvel Crusaders|Crusaders]], alongside [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Dyna-Mite]], [[Ghost Girl (Marvel Comics)|Ghost Girl]], Thunderfist, [[Captain Wings]], and Tommy Lightning. The team eventually learns that Alfie is a German agent, but not before he has manipulated them into fighting the Allied super-team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Upon learning how they had been duped, all the Crusaders but Naslund left costumed adventuring.

When the original Captain America, Steve Rogers, and his sidekick, [[Bucky|Bucky Barnes]], went [[missing in action]] in 1945, [[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] recruited Naslund and a young man named [[Bucky#Legacy|Fred Davis]] to become the new Captain America and Bucky. They briefly fought alongside the Invaders and the post-war [[All-Winners Squad]].  Naslund was killed in 1946 in the line of duty by an [[android]] named [[Adam II]] while warning the rest of the All-Winners Squad of Adam II's attempt to kidnap or kill then-Congressional candidate [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>''What If'' #4 (Aug. 1977; canonincal story)</ref> Naslund was succeeded as Captain America by Jeffrey Mace, formerly the superhero the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]].
