The Marvel Comics superhero '''Spirit of '76''' ('''William Naslund''') [[first appeared]] in ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #14 (March 1977), and was created by [[writer]] [[Roy Thomas]] and [[artist]] [[Frank Robbins]] as part of a [[World War II]]-era [[superhero]] team, the [[Crusaders (comics)#Marvel Crusaders|Crusaders]], patterned on the DC group the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].

===Publication history===
Marvel's Spirit of '76 appeared as a member of the short-lived superhero team the Crusaders in ''The Invaders'' #14-15 (March-April 1977). In a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] portion of a story in issue  #4 (Aug. 1977) of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate-universe]] series ''[[What If? (comics)|What If?]]'', Naslund succeeds Steve Rogers as Captain America, the first of three official replacements until Rogers resumed the role years later. This [[retcon]] became necessary after Marvel's conflicting accounts of Captain America in 1950s and 1960s comics had created a discrepancy.

===Fictional character biography===
William Naslund was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  An athletic young man, hoping to help the Allies' World War II efforts in a unique way, he develops exceptional fighting skills and learns to copy some of moves Captain America employed with the discus-like shield that the superhero carried. He is recruited by a mysterious man called "Alfie" to become a costumed hero in the new team of adventurers called the [[Crusaders (comics)#Marvel Crusaders|Crusaders]], alongside [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Dyna-Mite]], [[Ghost Girl (Marvel Comics)|Ghost Girl]], Thunderfist, [[Captain Wings]], and Tommy Lightning. The team eventually learns that Alfie is a German agent, but not before he has manipulated them into fighting the Allied super-team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]].<ref>''Invaders'' #14-15</ref> Upon learning how they had been duped, all the Crusaders but Naslund left costumed adventuring.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

When the original Captain America, Steve Rogers, and his sidekick, [[Bucky|Bucky Barnes]], went [[missing in action]] in 1945, [[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] recruited Naslund and a young man named [[Bucky#Legacy|Fred Davis]] to become the new Captain America and Bucky.<ref>''What If'' Vol. 1 #4</ref> Alongside [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner and the original [[Red Guardian#Golden Age Red Guardian|Red Guardian]], the new Captain America stopped a Nazi plot to destroy the Potsdam Conference.<ref>''Namor Annual'' #1</ref> They briefly fought alongside the post-war [[All-Winners Squad]], battling [[Isbisa]],<ref>''All-Winners Comics'' #19</ref> and with the [[Blonde Phantom]], fought to prevent a criminal attempt to steal the atomic bomb, encountering a time-traveling [[She-Hulk]] during this mission.<ref>''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2 #22</ref>  Naslund was killed in 1946 in the line of duty when he was crushed to death by a robot serving the [[android]] named [[Adam II]] while warning the rest of the All-Winners Squad of Adam II's attempt to kidnap or kill then-Congressional candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] in Boston.<ref>''What If'' #4 (Aug. 1977; canonincal story)</ref> Naslund was succeeded as Captain America by Jeffrey Mace, formerly the superhero the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Naslund was later brought through time by the [[Contemplator]] to battle an Adam II of an alternate world alongside the original Captain America, Jeffrey Mace, and the [[Grand Director|fourth Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
William Naslund was an athletic man with no superhuman powers, but was a superb hand-to-hand combatant.  As the Spirit of '76, he designed and wore a cloak made of an unknown bulletproof and fireproof material.  As Captain America, he carried a steel shield, approximately 2.5 feet in diameter, and fashioned by the U.S. government after the design used by the original Captain America.
