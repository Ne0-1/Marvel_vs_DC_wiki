'''Midas''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mordecai Midas was once a starving child in Europe.  He became a billionaire, determined to become the richest man by any means possible.  

Midas was rescued [[Madame Masque|Whitney Frost]] from a sinking ship, and gave her a golden mask to hide her scarred features.  Midas sent Whitney, as '''Madame Masque''', to sabotage Stark Industries, hoping to kill Stark (and his alter ego, [[Iron Man]] and receive the business after Tony's cousin Morgan Stark inherited it.  Midas captured Iron Man, but Madam Masque fell in love with Stark and freed him.  Iron Man and Midas fought, and in the conflict Midas' chair was damaged, resulting in an explosion that destroyed Midas' base.

Midas had a number of subsequent run-ins with Iron Man and other heroes such as [[Jack of Hearts]], the [[Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|Wraith]], [[Jasper Sitwell]], and [[Jean DeWolff]].

==Powers and abilities==
Midas dresses in the clothing of ancient Greece, and supports his enormous weight by wearing a power exoskeleton.  He rides a special weapon-filled throne that moves on a field of compressed air like a hydrocraft foil. Midas's "golden touch" allows him to paralyze a person's nervous system while giving the victim's skin a golden color.
