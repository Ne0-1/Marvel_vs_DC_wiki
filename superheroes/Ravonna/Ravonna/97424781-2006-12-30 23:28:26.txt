'''Ravonna''' Lexus Renslayer, also known as '''Terminatrix''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==

Ravonna Lexus Renslayer was the daughter of a puppet ruler of [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s in the [[40th century]]. While the kingdom threatened rebellion, Kang let it be in the hope of winning Ravonna's hand in marriage. Eventually, however, outright rebellion broke out, and as Kang was on the verge of winning the battle, he brought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] there to witness his triumph. However, a renegade general attempted to shoot Kang at the close, and Ravonna, realising she loved Kang, threw herself in front of the bullet.

Kang preserved her in statis for a time, but when he played a game with the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]], to save her and kill the Avengers, he only partially won, and chose in anger to kill the Avengers. After he failed due to the presence of the [[Dane Whitman|Black Knight]], who was not then an Avenger, the Grandmaster revived her anyway out of curiosity and told her of the choice Kang had made. Angered, she swore revenge on Kang.

She later manipulated the Avengers under the guise of [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], causing them to disband. Still later, she fought openly with Kang as '''Terminatrix''', a battle which ended with Kang apparently sacrificing himself to save her in the same manner she once had him.

After ruling Kang's kingdom for a time, and becoming bored, she revived Kang - and stabbed him through the heart. She later revived him again, properly, and the two became lovers until Kang himself became bored and left to reassume his earlier identity of Rama-Tut and battle his younger self.

She was reported deceased in the destruction of Chronopolis, Kang's extra-temporal kingdom, in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'', but this was deliberately kept off-panel to leave a loophole for her to return.
