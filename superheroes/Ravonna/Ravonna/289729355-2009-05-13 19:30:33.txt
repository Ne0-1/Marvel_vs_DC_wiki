'''Ravonna''' Lexus Renslayer, also known as '''Terminatrix''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ravonna Lexus Renslayer was the daughter of a puppet ruler of an unrevealed kingdom of [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s in the 40th century. Ravonna first met Kang when he attempted to annex her time era into his empire. While the kingdom threatened rebellion, Kang let it be in the hope of winning the princess Ravonna's hand in marriage. Eventually, however, outright rebellion broke out, and as Kang was on the verge of winning the battle, he brought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] there to witness his triumph. However, a renegade general attempted to shoot Kang at the close, and Ravonna, realizing she loved Kang, threw herself in front of the bullet, and fell into a death-like coma.<ref>''Avengers'' #23 - 24 (Dec. 1965 - Jan. 1966)</ref>

Kang preserved her in stasis for a time, but when he played a game with the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] in a tournament of champions, to gain the power to free Ravonna and kill the Avengers, he only partially won, and chose in anger to try to kill the Avengers instead. After he failed due to the presence of the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], who was not then an Avenger, he lost his chance to save her.<ref>''Avengers'' #69-71</ref> A temporal counterpart of Ravonna was later revealed to be a consort of Kang, and later learned to be a confederate of [[Immortus]] in his scheme to defeat Kang.<ref>''Avengers'' #267-269</ref> In Flashback, it was revealed that the real Ravonna was rescued by the Grandmaster, who revived her despite Kang's choice out of curiosity and told her of the choice Kang had made. She was embittered at Kang for not saving her when he had the chance, and she swore revenge on Kang.<ref>revealed in ''Avengers Annual'' #21</ref>

She became a subversive and assassin.  She appeared to [[Doctor Druid]] in visions in a scheme to enlist his aid in acquiring the deadliest weapon in the omniverse. Assuming the guide of Avengers foe [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], she attempted to infiltrate the Council of Cross-Time Kangs. She completed her mental subjugation of Doctor Druid, and directed him to takeover leadership of the Avengers. She used Druid to help her ensorcel the Avengers to accompany her to the center of a timestorm to retrieve the great weapon. She was ultimately thwarted by the Avengers and three Cross-Time Kangs, and fell into the timestorm with Druid.<ref>''Avengers'' #291-297</ref> As Nebula, she attempted to enlist the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]] to free her. She appeared in a vision to the [[Human Torch]], and mind-controlled the [[Invisible Woman]]. She attempted to steal the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], but was thwarted by the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #337-341</ref> She eventually escaped the timestorm to Lincoln, Nebraska in 1961, where she was thwarted by a rejuvenated Doctor Druid.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #37</ref>

Still later, she vainly attempted to enthrall Doctor Druid again. She convinced Druid to help her investigate Kang's 20th Century stronghold.  Taking the name '''Temptress''', she met the Fantastic Four, and used their time-sled to enter Chronopolis. She then fought openly with the prime Kang as '''Terminatrix''' in a personal duel, a battle which ended with Kang apparently sacrificing himself to save her in the same manner she once had him.  She became ruler of Chronopolis with his defeat.<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #11; ''Thor Annual'' #17; ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23; ''Avengers Annual'' #21</ref>

After ruling Kang's kingdom for a time, and becoming bored, she revived Kang â€” and stabbed him through the heart.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} She later revived him again, properly, and the two became lovers until Kang himself became bored and left to reassume his earlier identity of Rama-Tut and battle his younger self.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

She was reported deceased in the destruction of Chronopolis, Kang's extra-temporal kingdom, in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'',{{Issue|date=May 2009}} but this was deliberately kept off-panel to leave a loophole for her to return.{{Original research|date=May 2009}}
