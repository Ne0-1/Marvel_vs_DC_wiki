==Fictional character biography==
Gorr grew up on a nameless barren planet. When his mother, mate and children died, he thought gods could not exist and because of that he was outcast by his tribe. When he learned gods did in fact exist but did not help those in need such as his dying family, he vowed to kill them all. He then acquired All-Black the Necrosword from [[Knull (comics)|Knull]] after witnessing Knull in combat with a golden god.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6</ref><ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #4</ref> He eventually finds young [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Odinson]] on Earth in [[Medieval]] [[Iceland]]. He nearly kills Thor, but a band of [[Vikings]] come to rescue him. Gorr escapes, having his arm cut off, but learns he needs help, so he creates an army of shadow berserkers, then slowly and quietly eliminates more and more gods. In the present, Thor notices the missing gods and investigates their disappearances. This brings Gorr and Thor to another battle, but Gorr then teleports into the future, where an [[Alternative versions of Thor (Marvel Comics)#King Thor|aged Thor]] is the last Asgardian defending the realm against the shadow berserkers. Gorr also brings the young Thor into the future, where his wife and children have seemingly been resurrected and is about to set off the Godbomb. Gorr's son is actually a construct made out of the Necrosword and despises what his father has turned into, so it gives Thor the power to absorb the blast. Thor, from the present then uses the two Mjolnirs to kill Gorr.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #11 (October, 2013)</ref>
