'''Destiny''' ('''Irene Adler''') was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], known as an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne]], she first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #141 ([[1981#January|January 1981]]).

Although [[blindness|blind]], Destiny was a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[precognition|precognitive]] able to accurately predict future events. She filled several [[diary|diaries]] with the future history of mankind, the search for which was a main storyline in the [[2000s]] series ''[[X-Treme X-Men]],'' years after Destiny died.

Claremont originally intended Destiny to be the lover of [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] teammate [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] but Marvel editors did not allow [[homosexuality|gay]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] characters at that time. Currently, it has been confirmed that the two were lovers.

==Fictional character history==
Irene Adler was born in [[Salzburg, Austria]].  Destiny was the [[lesbian]] lover of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].  Mystique was working as a consulting detective when Destiny sought her help in understanding the precognitive visions recorded in her diaries<ref>[[X-Treme X-Men]] #1</ref>.  Background details suggest that this meeting took place around 1900.  Together, the two raised adopted daughter [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in their home in fictional Caldecott County, [[Mississippi]].  They remained together until Destiny's death.

[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and Destiny formed the second [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], a group of ideologically-motivated terrorists, and eventually went to work for the United States government as [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] in exchange for a pardon and protection from anti-mutant sentiment.  

While on a mission with Freedom Force, Destiny was killed by [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]], who was being influenced at the time by the [[Shadow King]].  Shortly before her death, she predicted that Mystique would become romantically involved with [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], and although the pair loathed each other at the time, they did develop a brief relationship while both were members of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. A story in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' depicts Mystique scattering Destiny's ashes at sea. Most recently, the team of ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' spent some time searching for her diaries of future predictions, but these became useless when a prediction in them was prevented from taking place.

Mystique later protects a young mutant named [[Trevor Chase]] who addressed her as "Auntie Raven" strongly impling that Chase was Destiny's grandson<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' vol. 1 #135</ref>.  It is not certain whether Chase's mother was born before Mystique and Destiny became lovers or whether, like Mystique, Destiny had a child during the course of their relationship.

==Power and abilities==
Destiny had the ability to see future probabilities and interpret them to best select or manipulate what was likely to happen. And even though she was blind, she carried a small crossbow with her that she used offensively, and had pretty good aim because she saw where it would land in her precognitive visions.

==Appearances in other media==
Destiny appeared in the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' animated series. In the series she is not part of the Brotherhood and never wore a costume, but is Mystique's best friend and took care of Rogue before she joined the X-Men.

More recently, Destiny appeared as an [[Non-player character|NPC]] in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''. She is depicted as a former Brotherhood member who quit and relocated to Avalon in the Savage Land after having a vision Apocalypse would attack, Beast will die, and Angel would betray the X-Men.

==Alternate versions==
'''Destiny''' appeared in the [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] ruled reality, the [[Age of Apocalypse]].  She had retired in the paradise of Avalon and was convinced by the X-Men that [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]'s claims were true.  She appeared in X-Calibre'' #1-4 and X-Men:Omega.
