'''Destiny''' ('''Irene Adler''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character]], known as an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne]], The character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #141 ([[1981#January|January 1981]]). She died in issue #255.

Although [[blindness|blind]], Destiny was a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[precognition|precognitive]] able to accurately predict future events. She filled several [[diary|diaries]] with the future history of mankind, the search for which was a main storyline in the [[2000s]] series ''[[X-Treme X-Men]],'' years after Destiny died.

As far back as 1981, Claremont had intended Destiny to be the lover of [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] teammate [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], but Marvel editors did not allow [[homosexuality|gay]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] characters at that time. She was simply referred to as the only member of the new Brotherhood that Mystique saw as a friend, all the other members being male. Some twenty years later, it was confirmed that the two were lovers.

==Fictional character biography==     
Irene Adler was born in [[Salzburg, Austria]]. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] was working as a consulting detective when Destiny sought her help in understanding the precognitive visions recorded in her diaries<ref>[[X-Treme X-Men]] #1</ref>. During this time the two fell in love. Background details suggest that this meeting took place around 1900.

She was more accurate in predicting near-future events concerning her present environment. But in a period of 12 months during her adolescence, Irene had produced 13 volumes of prophecies concerning the late 20th and early 21st centuries. When that period ended, Irene was left physically blind and haunted by disturbing images of uncertain meaning. She enlisted Raven's services in pursuit of two goals: the deciphering of her recorded prophecies and a mission to prevent the most terrifying of them from ever being fulfilled.  

The two women would soon become life-long friends and lovers.  But they both discovered that their set goals were difficult to achieve.  Their abilities would easily allow them to achieve personal success but to shape the future was stated to be "next to impossible" as it would require "[[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]."  

Together, the two raised adopted daughter [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in their home in fictional Caldecott County, [[Mississippi]].  They remained together until Destiny's death.

===Brotherhood===
[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and Destiny formed the second [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], a group of ideologically-motivated terrorists. She attempted to assassinate Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] with a crossbow, but was thwarted by the [[X-Men]] and taken into custody.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142</ref>. She was rescued from [[Ryker's Island]] along with the rest of the Brotherhood, but ended up battling the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and was recaptured.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10</ref> She predicted Rogue's disappearance from Mystique's custody.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170</ref> She observed, but did not participate, in one of the Brotherhood's last skirmishes with the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #178</ref>

===Freedom Force===
Eventually, the members of Mystique's Brotherhood went to work for the United States government as [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] in exchange for a pardon and protection from anti-mutant sentiment. She apprehended [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] alongside Freedom Force in that group's first mission for the United States government.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref> She assisted Freedom Force in taking the Avengers into custody at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #15</ref> She participated in Freedom Force's attempted arrest of the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225</ref> during which she "foresaw" the death of the X-Men during the ''"[[Fall of the Mutants]]."''<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #226</ref>

While on a mission with Freedom Force to [[Muir Island]] to stop the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], Destiny was killed by [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]], who was being influenced at the time by the [[Shadow King]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #255</ref> Shortly before her death, she predicted that Mystique would become romantically involved with [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], and although the pair loathed each other at the time, they did develop a brief relationship while both were members of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. A story in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' depicts Mystique scattering Destiny's ashes at sea. Most recently, the team of ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' spent some time searching for her diaries of future predictions, but these became useless when a prediction in them was prevented from taking place. However, the diaries have recently been sought out again by the [[Marauders]], who believe them to contain information on the eventual fate of mutant-kind in the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. The diaries, however, were destroyed by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] before the Marauders could read them.

Mystique later protects a young mutant named [[Trevor Chase]] who addressed her as "Auntie Raven" strongly implying that Chase was Destiny's grandson<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' vol. 1 #135</ref>.  It is not certain whether Chase's mother was born before Mystique and Destiny became lovers or whether, like Mystique, Destiny had a child during the course of their relationship.

==Power and abilities==
Destiny was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] that had the ability of psionic precognition, to see future probabilities and interpret them to best select or manipulate what was likely to happen. This allowed her to compensate for her blindness by seeing where objects in her path would be. The accuracy of Destiny's ability to foresee the future decreases in direct proportion to the distance ahead in time.

She carried a small crossbow with her that she used offensively, and had good aim because she "saw" where it would land in her precognitive visions.

==Other versions==
'''Destiny''' appeared in the [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] ruled reality, the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. She had retired in the paradise of Avalon and was convinced by the X-Men that [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]'s claims were true. She appeared in ''X-Calibre'' #1-4 and ''X-Men: Omega''.

==In other media==
*Destiny appeared in the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' animated series voiced by [[Ellen Kennedy]]. In the series she is not part of the Brotherhood and never wore a costume, but is Mystique's best friend and took care of Rogue before she joined the X-Men.

*More recently, Destiny appeared as an [[Non-player character|NPC]] in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Marsha Clark]]. She is depicted as a former Brotherhood member who quit and relocated to Avalon in the Savage Land after having a vision Apocalypse would attack, Beast will die, and Angel would betray the X-Men.
