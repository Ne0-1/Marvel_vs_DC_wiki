The '''Ogress''' ('''Diane Davids''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Diane Davids was a [[lawyer]] and a resident of Middletown, an isolated town in the middle of a desert. She got frustrated with defending criminals that she once destroyed her client's briefcase and was held in contempt of court. It was the kind of town that no one would miss, which is probably why the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s old enemy [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] decided to expose it to gamma radiation. He hoped some of its inhabitants would survive and join him in his new kingdom of Freehold.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #345</ref> Diane was one of only five people to survive a gamma explosion and develop superhuman powers. Diane became Ogress and joined the other four people into forming the [[Riot Squad (comics)|Riot Squad]] where they protected Leader's Freehold base at the time when Leader had contacted a terminal illness. They first clashed with Hulk when Leader would provide him the information on where [[Betty Ross]] is in exchange that Hulk kills [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #366</ref>

Ogress was with the Riot Squad where they helped the [[U-Foes]] distract Hulk and the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] at the time when Leader was meeting with [[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #397</ref> Hulk and the Pantheon's fight with the U-Foes and the Riot Squad are broken up when Agamemnon reaches an agreement with Leader.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk #398</ref>

Ogress was present with the Riot Squad at the time when [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] invades Leader's base with the resulting conflict causing the death of Soul Man (who was in the middle of reviving [[Marlo Chandler]]).<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #400</ref>

Ogress and Hotshot fight Hulk at the time when Omnibus plans to cause destruction throughout the world and they end up defeated.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #439</ref> Ogress was among those with Hotshot when they storm Omnibus' lair and accuse him of being behind the Alliance before taking him away.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #440</ref>

Ogress and the rest of the Riot Squad worked with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to shut down the remaining bombs. The Riot Squad then judges Omnibus to be guilty of being behind the Alliance and end up sentencing Omnibus to death.<ref>''Avengers'' #397</ref> Ogress and the rest of the Riot Squad left Omnibus in the Arctic to die.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #442</ref>
