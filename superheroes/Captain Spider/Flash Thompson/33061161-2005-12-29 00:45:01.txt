'''Eugene "Flash" Thompson''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], part of the supporting cast of [[Spider-Man]]. He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

{{spoiler}}

==History==
Thompson was a [[high school]] classmate of Peter Parker. During high school, Thompson was portrayed as a stereotypical stock [[jock]] bully who continually [[bully|bullied]] Peter. It was Thompson who dubbed Peter with the derogatory nickname "Puny Parker". Ironically, Flash admired Spider-Man, Parker's other identity, forming a "Spider-Man Fan Club" and vocally supporting his idol wherever he went, even criticizing [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and his editorials to his face.

Over time, it was revealed that the true reason behind Flash's poor attitude was because he was physically abused by his alcoholic father, Harrison Thompson. Flash idolized Spider-Man for being everything his father, a police officer, should have been.

After the two of them entered [[Empire State University]], Flash Thompson became less hostile to Peter, perhaps because he was no longer living under his father's negative influence. Over time Flash matured and mellowed and eventually he and Peter put their past antagonism behind them and became good friends. He was even [[best man]] at the wedding of Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]].

After a few years in university, Flash enlisted with the United States army and served in the [[Vietnam War]] (although, due to Marvel's sliding time scale, this has later been [[retcon]]ned to Flash serving in some unspecified overseas conflict). While in Vietnam, Flash's unit bombed an ancient temple that had previously housed a wounded Flash, although Flash tried to stop them. When he returned to America, Flash found himself tailed by mysterious assassins, former acolytes of the temple who thought that Flash had betrayed them. Spider-Man held off the assassins long enough for Flash to explain his side of the story. Sha Shan, the leader of the assassins, forgave Flash and even dated him for a while, but left him when she found out he was cheating on her. Flash's tour of duty profoundly changed him from a reckless and immature youth to a tormented and conflicted man. Finding no comfort in his military decorations, Flash turned to [[alcohol]] for years.

When Sha Shan was attacked by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Flash made the mistake of insulting the villain on television. The Hobgoblin took his revenge by abducting Flash and framing him as the Hobgoblin's true identity. Spider-Man was aghast that his old friend was a villain, but Flash was legally exonerated when the Hobgoblin's true identity was revealed.

Thompson has had relationships with several of Peter's girlfriends. In high school, he was [[Liz Allan]]'s boyfriend. One of the reasons Flash bullied Peter later on was because he secretly feared that Liz preferred Peter to him. Flash was once romantically involved with Mary Jane Watson, although briefly. He has also had affairs with [[Betty Brant]] and Felicia Hardy (the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]). Felicia dated him in order to make Peter jealous, but was surprised that she actually fell in love with him. Finally Flash broke up with her, as he felt he couldn't keep up to her high-speed lifestyle.

Recently, Flash was the victim of a plot by Norman Osborn, the [[Green Goblin]], who aimed to destroy Spider-Man through his family and friends. Under the pretense of picking Flash up from an A.A. meeting, Osborn force-fed Flash whiskey and had him crash his car into the high school where Peter works. Flash survived, thanks to his excellent physical condition, but he suffered severe brain damage that has left him in a coma. Liz Allan Osborn, although widowed and raising her son Normie all on her own, has become Flash's caretaker. Peter, blaming himself for what happened to Flash, makes a point of visiting his friend as often as he can. Whether Flash will ever regain consciousness remains to be seen.

==Other continuities==
In the 2002 [[film]] ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' Thompson was played by [[Joe Manganiello]].

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Flash Thompson is a jock who attends the same high school as and bullies Peter. It was revealed after [[Gwen Stacy]]'s death that he had a crush on her.

In the [[MC2]] continuity (the alternate future of [[Spider-Girl]]), Flash Thompson is now on the faculty of his old high school.  He is the coach of the girls' basketball team.  He had married Felicia Hardy and had at least one daughter, Felicity.  He still is unaware of the fact that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, and is similarly unaware that Peter's daughter, May, is Spider-Girl.  Felicity, on the other hand, is aware of all of this, and briefly assumed the identity of the [[Scarlet Spider]] in attempt to partner with Spider-Girl.

In the animated 1994 Spider-Man series, Flash tried to have relationships with [[Felicia Hardy/Black Cat]] and later with the brainy [[Debra Whitman]], neither of which were very successful.
