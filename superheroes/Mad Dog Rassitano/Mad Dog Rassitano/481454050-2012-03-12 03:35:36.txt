'''Mad Dog Rassitano''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] fictional character that first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]]'' #426 (1990). Mad Dog was created by [[Pittsburgh]] artist [[Ron Frenz]].

==First incarnation==
Mad Dog was part of a human [[Special Weapons And Tactics|SWAT]] team, named [[Code: Blue]], that dealt with super-powered criminals. The long-haired, wise-cracking Mad Dog specialized in all sorts of firearms and heavy weaponry. 

===Code: Blue teammates===
*Captain Shelley Conklin
*Daniel "Fireworks" Fielstein
*Samuel "Mother" Majowski
*Chief O'Grady
*Margarita "Rigger" Ruiz
*Lt. Marcus Stone
*Aaron Christopher Curzon
*Andrew "Jock" Jackson

==Second incarnation==
Mad Dog returns in ''[[Amazing Spider-Girl]]'' #4. In this Marvel alternate future title, Mad Dog is completely shaven and now a bounty hunter with his own TV show.

Mad Dog now uses various super weaponry, ostensibly taken from the super-villains he brings to justice &ndash; though he has revealed to Spider-Girl that they are only replicas of the villains' weapons, made for the publicity.

===Equipment used===
*The Shocker Gauntlet (taken from [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]) &mdash; when activated by a thumb trigger, can project a concentrated blast of air that has been vibrated at an intense frequency.
*The Prowler Glove (taken from [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]]) &mdash; an extremely sharp steel claw.
*The Cyclone Belt (taken from [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]]) &mdash; used to create [[whirlwind]]s
*Jump Boots (taken from [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]]) &mdash; used to jump greater distances
*Cardiac Staff (taken from [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]]) &mdash; used to produce powerful bolts of [[electricity]]
*Beetle Glove (taken from [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]) &mdash; can stretch and stick to most surfaces
*Telescopic Legs (taken from [[Stilt-Man]]) &mdash; a pair of extremely long, [[telescopic]] metal legs, which allow him to tower high over the ground
