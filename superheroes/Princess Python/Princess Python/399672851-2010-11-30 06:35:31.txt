'''Princess Python''' ('''Zelda DuBois''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]], most notably as a member of the [[Circus of Crime]]. She has no superhuman abilities, but rather relies on her [[snake charming]] skills and her {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} pet rock [[Pythonidae|python]] snake. She has fought several [[superhero]]es, ranging from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to [[Iron Man]]. She is also notable as she was the first [[villainess]] that [[Spider-Man]] has faced. She is normally seen with the Circus of Crime, but had a short stint with the [[Serpent Society]] until she was banned for cowardice.  She first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #22 (Mar 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zelda DuBois, born in [[Darlington, South Carolina]], developed an act as a snake charmer and circus performer using a twenty-five foot python as a young adult. Presumably, she joined the Circus of Crime in its early days but isn't actually seen as a professional criminal until the formation of the Masters of Menace. It is, in fact, the Princess who convinces the others to get rid of the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], appoint the Clown as the leader, rename the group (she comes up with the name), and go out on a crime spree of their own. The Masters of Menace steal paintings from a Madison Avenue Art Gallery where they run afoul of Spider-Man. However, the web-slinger is unwilling to hit a woman and turns out to be putty in Zelda's hands. She maneuvers the wall-crawler into a fight with her pet but is defeated when Spider-Man maneuvers her into the arms of the law.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #22</ref>

When they get out of prison, the Masters of Menace agree to rejoin the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime. They try to hypnotize Avengers' members [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and the [[Scarlet Witch]] into joining them but fail. Princess Python fights hand-to-hand with the Scarlet Witch but loses when the Witch uses her hex power to soak her down with water. The Circus of Crime does escape capture, however.<ref>''Avengers'' #22</ref>

The Circus next schemes to steal a huge golden bull but they need a new strong man to replace theirs since "he strained himself trying to lift the elephant". They find the Mighty [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] who has been stripped of his godly power but is still superhumanly strong. Thor is hypnotized into stealing the massive golden bull but Princess Python is trapped under the idol in the melee that follows. Thor rescues her. The grateful and somewhat smitten Princess tells the police that Thor was duped into helping them before she uses her snake to escape and rejoin the Circus.<ref>''Thor'' #145-147</ref>

In their next caper, the Circus disguises themselves as caterers in order to sneak into [[Avengers Mansion]] so they can disrupt the wedding of [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. Zelda's giant python jumps out of the wedding cake and puts the squeeze on the Wasp. But Yellowjacket turns out to be Hank Pym (which no one knew at the time) and he disrupts the plan by turning into Giant-Man, yanking the python off of the Wasp and tying it around the Ringmaster instead. Princess Python tries to sneak away, only to be decked by a punch from the Wasp.<ref>''Avengers'' #60</ref>

The Circus then sets up a scheme that involves enlisting a mind-controlled [[Ulik]] the Troll as an accomplice. Thor thwarts the plan and ties Zelda up with her own python in the process.<ref>''Thor'' #173</ref>

At this point, the Princess struck out on her own. She goes out to [[Stark Industries]] and manages to get an opportunity to get her python around Tony Stark. She tells the world that she wants "one million dollars and a jet plane to South America" or Stark dies. Stark, secretly Iron Man, frees himself by using his chest-plate to shock the snake. This isn't good enough. According to Zelda, her "precious" has been specially bred to be able to crush Iron Man's armor. The python nearly does so until Iron Man kills it by tossing it in a vat of acid. Zelda is so distraught over the death of her pet that she jumps in after it; only to be saved by Iron Man before she hits the acid. Iron Man, clearly not a pet lover, suggests the Princess be "taken care of by good doctors" because of her excessive hatred of him over the death of her snake.<ref>''Iron Man'' #50</ref>

Apparently, the Princess gets away from those doctors to whom Iron Man consigned her. The Princess acquires a new trained python and gets recruited by [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] to start a new Serpent Squad. Zelda breaks the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]] and the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] out of jail and they all battle [[Captain America]] in his Nomad identity. Eventually they are joined by [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]] who is in possession of the [[Serpent Crown]] and the whole thing ends up involving the [[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]] and [[Roxxon Oil]]. The Princess is defeated and led off to jail.<ref>''Captain America'' #180-181</ref> She is back with the Circus of Crime soon after, but she and the Circus are defeated by Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #118</ref>

But the Circus never makes it to jail. They are freed from a prison wagon on its way to the penitentiary by [[Live Wire (Marvel Comics)|Live Wire]] who then joins the group.<ref>''Power Man'' #24</ref>

===Back with the Circus===
But she ends up back with the Circus when the group captures [[Luke Cage]]. Zelda finds herself attracted to Luke which doesn't please Luke's girlfriend [[Claire Temple]]. With the help of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]], Luke Cage defeats the Circus. Zelda is stopped when Luke's pal [[D.W. Griffith (comics)|D.W. Griffith]] hypnotizes her with the Ringmaster's hat.<ref>''Power Man'' #25</ref>

With the Circus of Crime, Princess Python captured the sea-nymph Meriam, and fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #217</ref> The Circus reaches its lowest point when it tries to enlist [[Howard the Duck]] as an unwilling accomplice, but he defeats them with help from Iris Raritan. Zelda gets bitten on the nose by Howard and runs away sobbing.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #25-27</ref>

There's an adventure involving the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and the former Black Goliath now calling himself Giant-Man,<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76</ref> and another involving the mind-controlled Hulk and [[Dragon Man]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #292</ref> Then [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] recruits Zelda to join the Serpent Society and she attends an organizational meeting. The Society is led by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] and its other members are [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]], [[Cottonmouth (comics)|Cottonmouth]], [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]], the Cobra, the [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], the [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]], and [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]]. The Society is a longtime thorn in Captain America's side but the Princess decides to break away from the group when they are dispatched to kill [[MODOK]] and runs out.<ref>''Captain America'' #309-311, 313</ref> She is captured and brought back, where she is questioned and tortured by Sidewinder.<ref>''Captain America'' #315</ref> She is sent to be ransomed back to the Circus of Crime, but Death Adder, who is delivering her, is killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] before the transaction is complete.<ref>''Captain America'' #318</ref>

===Two Circuses===
Somehow, she finds her way back to the Circus where she is captured and defeated by the [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #1</ref> Princess Python then turns up as the master of ceremonies at the "power pageant" of [[Superia]]'s Femizons, introducing all the members of the group to each other. She battles Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] when they board Superia's cruise ship.<ref>''Captain America'' #389-392</ref> Later, she gets refused admittance to the [[Bar With No Name]] by the bouncer ([[Angar the Screamer]]) because she won't check her python at the door.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Again with the Circus, she is thwarted by the [[Ben Reilly]] Spider-Man,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Howard the Duck,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]],{{Issue|date=April 2009}} the Peter Parker Spider-Man,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon-Boy]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Around this time, Zelda hooks up with Johnny Blaze, the former [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], who operates the Quentin Carnival. Python develops friendships among the crew and deep romantic feelings for Johnny. When there was trouble in a nearby trailer, she and Kody, a wolf-man, rush over and succumb to knock-out gas by the trailer's owner, the assassin known as [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]. While Johnny defeats Arcade, Kody drags her to safety.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Zelda and the other Masters of Menace (Clown, Cannonball and Gambonnos) resorted to armed robbery in between their stints of running the Circus (without the Ringmaster who has gone straight). The Hulk busted up these plans but the Princess was not captured in the process. She remains free and at large.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Civil War===
[[Image:Pwj16.jpg|thumb|left|Cover art for ''Punisher War Journal (vol 2)'' #16<br>Art by [[Alex Maleev]]<br>Princess Python in the foreground]]

Zelda's was next making the startling revelation that she had been married to [[Stilt-Man]] during the latter's funeral held by supervillains and former supervillains<ref>[[The Punisher War Journal]] vol. 2 #4</ref>. It was for her that a robot Doctor Doom was made to attend so as to give her the belief that Stilt-Man had been respected by some of the "major league" supervillains, and she also shared a sympathy dance with the [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]]. By the end of the issue, the Bar that the wake had been held in was blown up by the Punisher.  It was later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]."<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' (volume 2) #17</ref>

Later, it was revealed that she was blinded in the explosion, but she has since married the Gibbon.  Her python, [[Pythagoras]], had also gotten sick and died, however, Gibbon bought her a new python at the end of the story.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #16</ref>

At the beginning of the ''Marvel Apes'' storyline, the Gibbon admits that even if Zelda truly loved him in the past, currently she's fed up with the loser streak of her new husband, and so they parted.<ref>''Marvel Apes'' #1</ref>

===Dark Reign===
At the end of ''[[Young Avengers|Dark Reign: Young Avengers]]'' #2, Daniel, or "the Executioner", a member of the New Young Avengers call his mother on the phone to talk about [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]]. His mother turns out to be Princess Python.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #2</ref> Daniel seems unaware of Princess Python costumed adventures, as their dialogue implies Daniel knows Zelda DuBois as a simple, but shady and rich businesswoman. Princess Python pressures Daniel into contacting Kate Bishop, even setting him a large fund for his New Young Avengers/Young Masters of Evil.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #3</ref>

In ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #4, Daniel places a bomb in Zelda's car after learning of her super-villain past. Zelda is caught in the explosion.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Princess Python has no super human powers; however, she is a trained athlete and an extremely talented snake charmer and handler. She usually carries a hand held, electric cattle prod capable of discharging 1,000 volts.

Princess Python has a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} trained pet [[rock python]]. She has had more than one such snake in her criminal career.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Princess Python===
Princess Python appeared in the [[Ultimate Universe]] as a member of the all-female [[Serpent Squad]].  However, unlike her [[Earth-616]] version, this Princess Python has super-strength, and was able to knock a piece of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s body off him.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}
