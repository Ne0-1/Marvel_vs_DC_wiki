Captain Midlands is a [[patriotic]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[war veteran]] and a right-wing analogue of [[Captain America]]. An eighty year old superhero, Captain Midlands is often portrayed as a [[Irritable Male Syndrome|grumpy old git]]. His real name, "Rambling" Sid Ridley, is is a combination of [[Kenneth Williams]]' ''[[Round the Horne]]'' character ‘Rambling Sid Rumpo’ and [[Arnold Ridley]] who played [[Private Godfrey]] in the [[sitcom]] [[Dad's Army]]<ref name="W1C">{{cite web|title=Wisdom Issue One Commentary.

After serving as '''Captain Midlands''' in [[World War II]] , Ridley somehow ended up in [[British Intelligence]] and eventually [[MI-13 (Marvel Comics)|MI-13]]<ref name="Wisdom#1"/>. Ridley also suggested that he had "[[Pregnancy|knocked a girl up]]" and married her before she died in 1963.<ref name="Wisdom#3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Manuel Garcia]] | Inker = [[Mark Farmer]] | Story = The Rudiments of Wisdom.

Captain Midlands served alongside other British heroes, including [[Captain Britain]] and [[Pete Wisdom]] in MI-13, fighting supernatural threats such as [[fairies]]<ref name="Wisdom#1"/>, [[Y Ddraig Goch]]<ref name="Wisdom#3"/>, alternate reality [[Jack the Ripper]]s and [[Martians]]. He was also reported to be fighting the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of Britain.<ref name="CB&MI13#1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = [[Captain Britain and MI: 13]] | Issue = 1 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

When MI:13 refocused itself against a supernatural pandemic, Captain Midlands - while carrying out routine crimefighting - identified a demonic incursion in Birmingham and called it in to the agency. He was captured and imprisoned in a [[council estate]] basement, being tempted to give his soul for an unknown desire. He was freed by and joined Pete Wisdom's strike team. <ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #6</ref>

==Abilities and equipment==
Captain Midlands has no superhuman powers, although as a result of the [[1940's]] British Super-Soldier program Sid Ridley was transformed into a "perfect" specimen of human development and conditioning. Captain Midlands' strength, endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, and durability are at the highest limits of natural human potential, and despite being an eighty year old man he still has a body of a superhero.<ref name="CBR"/>

Captain Midlands wears full [[Disruptive Pattern Material|DPM]] military fatigues and helmet with a cowl mask (similar to the WWII [[Ultimate Captain America]] outfit) and wields a golden [[Captain America's shield|circular shield]] in the design of the traditional [[British Lion|lion symbol of Britain]] and coated in an Anti-Magic nanominium gloss.<ref name="Wisdom#1"/>
