[[Image:Action525.jpg|thumb|The cover of ‘’[[Action Comics]]’’ #525 ([[November]]] [[1981]]), Neutron's first appearance. Art by [[Ross Andru]].]]'''Neutron''' is a [[fictional]] [[villain]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe.  He was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Joe Staton]], and first appeared in ''Action Comics'' #525 ([[November]] [[1981]])

Nathaniel Tryon was a petty thug who teamed up with two others as the TNT Trio.  While on a caper at a [[nuclear power plant]] at which he worked as a security guard, Tryon was caught in the meltdown of a [[nuclear reactor]], turning his body into sentient nuclear energy that could only be contained in a special containment suit.  After learning how to control his energy, and learning that the accident was allegedly caused and covered up by the [[U.S. Government]], Tryon killed those responsible for the accident and took up a criminal career as Neutron. 

Eventually, he battled [[Superman]] and was defeated and imprisoned by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]].  He and another criminal imprisoned there, [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]], were eventually freed when S.T.A.R. Labs was attacked by the [[Fearsome Five]], who took the two criminals into their ranks, but Neutron subsequently left the group.

Neutron eventually joined [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] and [[Plasmus]] on a mission from [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]] to assassinate [[Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]], the adoptive parents of Superman.  Superman intervened and the clash ended with Plasmus and Neutron colliding in a blast that oblierated them both. However, both later turned up alive, and Neutron was next seen in Slabside Island prison, from which he was freed during the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]’s "Last Laugh" riots. Recently, Neutron and several other villains were manipulated by [[Manchester Black]] into threatening Clark Kent’s loved ones, but as had happened before, the ensuing confrontation with Superman ended with Neutron disappearing in an atomic blast.
