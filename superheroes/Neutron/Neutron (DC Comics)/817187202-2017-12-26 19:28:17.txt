'''Neutron''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]], appearing usually as an adversary of [[Superman]].

==Publication history==
Neutron first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #525 (November 1981) and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Joe Staton]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Nathaniel Tryon''' was a petty thug who teamed up with two others as the TNT Trio.  While on a caper at a [[nuclear power plant]] at which he worked as a security guard, Tryon was caught in the meltdown of a [[nuclear reactor]], turning his body into sentient nuclear energy that could only be contained in a special containment suit. After learning how to control his energy, and learning that the accident was allegedly caused and covered up by the [[U.S. Government]], Tryon killed those responsible for the accident and took up a criminal career as Neutron.

Eventually, he battled [[Superman]], and was defeated and imprisoned. He was later released by the manipulations of Abraxas Industries as part of an apparent [[work release]] program, when actually it was part of a [[propaganda]] campaign against Superman spearheaded by [[Vandal Savage]]. Neutron's part was to engage in seemingly random acts of destruction, when actually he had hired himself out as a [[Deconstruction (building)|deconstruction]] engineer, a fact which of course did not come out until after Superman had fought and arrested him. Vandal's schemes would later be revealed to the public, and Neutron was apparently arrested and re-imprisoned for his part in them.

He is next seen held at the research facility, [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. He and another criminal imprisoned there, [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], were eventually freed when S.T.A.R. Labs was attacked by the [[Fearsome Five]], who took the two criminals into their ranks, but Neutron subsequently left the group.<ref name="dc-fear">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Fearsome Five | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 120  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Neutron eventually joined [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] and [[Plasmus]] on a mission from [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]] to assassinate [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]], the adoptive parents of Superman. Superman intervened and the clash ended with Plasmus and Neutron colliding in a blast that obliterated them both. However, both later turned up alive, and Neutron was next seen in Slabside Island prison (aka "The Slab"), from which he was freed during the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]’s "Last Laugh" riots. Recently, Neutron and several other villains were manipulated by [[Manchester Black]] into threatening Clark Kent’s loved ones, but as had happened before, the ensuing confrontation with Superman ended with Neutron disappearing in an atomic blast.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Neutron became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

==="One Year Later"===
{{main|One Year Later}}
After the 2006 [[fictional crossover|crossover]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Neutron is working as a villain for hire. He and another radiation-powered villain, [[Radion (comics)|Radion]], were hired by [[Intergang]] to kill [[Clark Kent]]. After Kent was hit by a commuter train, Neutron and Radion left, thinking him dead, though the accident actually caused Kent to regain his powers as [[Superman]].

Neutron is also a member of the '''Nuclear Legion''' alongside Professor Radium, Geiger, Nuclear, Mister Nitro and [[Reactron]]. The Nuclear Legion was hired by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to invade [[Blüdhaven]] and  assist the [[Nuclear Family (comics)|Nuclear Family]] in recovering the source of a radiation leak. While there, the group fought the new [[Atomic Knight]]s.  Now sporting a new containment suit, Neutron was also seen fighting Superman in the pages of ''Superman'' #654, during a storyline in which Superman discovered that Intergang was planting mysterious energy spheres, about the size of softballs, in various locations in Metropolis.  Although Superman has not yet determined the nature or purpose of the spheres, he discovered that they were connected to his adversary [[Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim|Bruno Mannheim]], as well to other mysterious allies of Manheim who have yet to be revealed.

Neutron is one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. He is used by [[Lex Luthor]] as a power source for a teleporter. He is seemingly killed when the device self-destructs.

==Powers and abilities==
Neutron's body is composed of nuclear energy that grants him super strength, durability, nuclear blasts, flight at immense speed, transformation into pure energy, and radiation absorption.

==In other media==

===Television===
* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Neutron appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He later joins Grodd in his attempt to take back his position as leader within the Society and is killed off-screen following the destruction of the Secret Society's headquarters.
* On ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in the season 8 episode "Injustice", Neutron appeared with [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], [[Livewire (DC Comics)#Other TV appearances|Livewire]], and [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]], who formed into a team of [[Injustice League|meteor freak rogues]] who searched for [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. He is killed after letting Doomsday get away the first time.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Injustice|series=Smallville|credits=Al Septien, Turi Meyer (writers) & Tom Welling (director)|network=The CW|airdate=2009-05-07|season=8|number=21}}</ref>
* Neutron makes his appearance in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'' episode "Bloodlines" voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. He is dropped in Central City and runs rampant as a test by the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]]. His suit continuously releases waves of energy as well as blasters equipped on the wrists. [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] eventually challenges Neutron, but is almost killed until the intervention of [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]. The two speedsters and [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] devise a plan to defeat Neutron, but all this does is destroy his containment suit and force the mysterious aliens behind him to abandon the test. Flash attempts to grab Neutron and leave him in an abandoned area before he is hit by a radiation wave, but Impulse trips him by accident after he himself falls over a rock, saving Flash from an unpredicted burst of energy. After the burst Impulse throws a blue orb on him that reverts Neutron back to normal, apparently unaware of his actions. It is revealed at the end of the episode that he helped Bart Allen travel to the past to fix their apocalyptic future. It is also implied that Flash should have died when they fought, suggesting Bart tripped on purpose to save Flash. As soon as Bart goes back in time Neutron is instantly in new clothes (at the time he was wearing a [[Belle Reve]] collar and jumpsuit), but is horrified to realize that everything around him is still in ruins. In "Cornered", Neutron is seen attending [[Black Canary]]'s therapy session alongside the other victims of the Reach's experiments at a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] building in [[Taos, New Mexico]]. In "Runaways," Neutron tries to prevent [[Static (DC Comics)|Virgil Hawkins]], [[Apache Chief|Tye Longshadow]], [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Asami "Sam" Koizumi]], and [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|Eduardo Dorado Jr]] from escaping S.T.A.R. Labs. During [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]]'s fight with [[Red Volcano]], the five teenagers help Neutron and the S.T.A.R. Labs personnel get out of the collapsing S.T.A.R. Labs building.

===Audio Drama===
* Neutron was the main antagonist in the 40 min audio drama called "Superman & The Neutron Nightmare."
