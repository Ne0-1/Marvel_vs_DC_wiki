==Fictional character biography==
Brutale was a top-level interrogator/torturer for the secret police in the fictional Latin American country of Hasaragua, until a revolution forced him to flee. In his native Hasaragua, Guillermo Barrera served the secret police of his government as a savage interrogator, extracting confessions efficiently with blades and tools used for surgery. When the Marxist regime of Hasaragua fell, Barrera escaped the country to America, fleeing execution for the atrocities he committed.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Brutale | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 62  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Adopting the name Brutale, Barrera put his 'Surgical Skills' to use as a hired assassin. He eventually began working for [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)#Roland Desmond|Blockbuster]] in [[Bl√ºdhaven]] while donning a costume that resembles a [[gargoyle]]. He battled against [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] on several occasions.

In the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Brutale was among the villains that joined [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

In the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' storyline, Brutale was among the supervillains exiled to another planet. When the [[Parademon]]s under [[Desaad]]'s command attacked the camp, Brutale was stabbed by one of them.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #7 (July 2008)</ref> However, he was seen alive in the new [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] mini-series.

Brutale is featured in one issue of the Red Robin series. He is listed as one of the targets of Tim Drake-Wayne/Red Robin for his "Hit List". Red Robin catches him at a bar, attempting to terrorize the owners into paying fees due to a gang boss. He is accompanied by what Red Robin assumes is his 'girlfriend', who manages to escape as Red Robin takes Brutale down using his Escrima sticks.

In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Brutale shows up in the first issue of [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]] where he appears to be working for La Dama's group who are attempting to steal the scarab.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' (vol. 3) #1 (November 2011)</ref>
