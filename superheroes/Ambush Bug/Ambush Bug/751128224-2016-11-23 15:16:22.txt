'''Ambush Bug''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] who has appeared in several [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].
His real name is supposedly '''Irwin Schwab''', but he has mental problems that prevent him from truly understanding reality around him, so even his true identity might be no more than a delusion on his part. His origin is disputed, although the most commonly accepted origin is that Brum-El (a historical allusion to [[Beau Brummel]], as well as a reference to [[Superman]]'s father [[Jor-El]]) of the planet Schwab sent his clothes from his supposedly doomed planet, hoping that his wardrobe would survive, only to have it intercepted by a [[Spider-Man|giant radioactive space spider]]. In the resulting crash, only two articles of clothing survived: the Ambush Bug suit, which was subsequently found by Irwin Schwab; and "Argh!Yle!", an argyle sock with a [[Doctor Doom]]-like complex, complete with metal mask.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | contribution=Ambush Bug | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=13 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Created by artist [[Keith Giffen]] as an intentionally silly character, Ambush Bug first appeared in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #52 (Dec. 1982)<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 199 |quote = [Ambush Bug] made his debut in the pages of ''DC Comics Presents'' #52...[by] writer Paul Kupperberg and artist Keith Giffen.}}</ref> and would make appearances in several other [[Superman]]-related comic books in the early 1980s. At first, Ambush Bug was a villain, named after a type of insect, and dressed in a green, skintight suit (with two orange antennae) that covered his whole body. Inside his hollow antennae, he carried miniature robot bugs that possessed the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] him around. He was little more than an annoyance (though he did murder a district attorney in an early appearance in ''DC Comics Presents.'')  After attacking Superman and other heroes, Ambush Bug decided instead to be a [[superhero]] as well. He also fancied himself Superman's friend, which only annoyed the hero even more. The costume apparently then became permanently affixed to his body, and he gained the power to teleport by himself. (Again, it is unknown if this is true or just another delusion of his, as he is seen removing the costume at the end of his second mini-series.) While trying to fix one of the miniature bugs, it exploded, causing a chain reaction and a blast that destroyed all of the bugs and tinted Ambush Bug's costume temporarily black in a nod to [[Spider-Man]]'s costume change during [[Marvel Comics]]' "[[Secret Wars]]" crossover; he then became capable of teleporting even without the bugs (briefly considering changing his moniker to Black Beetle instead).

Ambush Bug became popular enough to be featured in two comic book miniseries and several specials, plotted and pencilled by Keith Giffen and scripted by [[Robert Loren Fleming]]. The series contains many comic book-enthusiast and DC in-jokes and satire; series editor [[Julius Schwartz]] is also a character in the book. Ambush Bug was even kicked out of the afterlife by [[Death (DC Comics)|Death of the Endless]], after seeing his name did not appear in any list she carried for the summer crossover series. He also met with Dream of the Endless in the Dreaming, and he accused him of not having a sense of humor as to make a living for himself in Dream's series in that capacity. Dream promptly responded by returning him to the real world while dumping tar on him, covering him with feathers, and leaving him in a dumpyard.

During his own 4-part series in 1985, he picked up a doll and, thinking it was alive, "adopted" it as a partner called "Cheeks, The Toy Wonder", complete with its own costume. Also during this series, he fought a genuine bad guy named Scabbard (from ''[[Thriller (DC Comics)|Thriller]]'', a title co-created by Fleming), who left the story midway through after realizing he was in the wrong comic book (Scabbard believed he was in an issue of ''Thriller'').

In 2001, he made his first appearance as part of a superhero group (albeit a small one) as a member of the "Justice League of Anarchy", which also included [[Plastic Man]], the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], [[Harley Quinn]], [['Mazing Man]], and the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. This group of DC Universe troublemakers made a one-panel cameo in a series exploring variations on the [[Justice League|JLA]] acronym, the book in question being ''JLA: Justice League of Amazons''.

Ambush Bug is largely considered an absurd character and is rarely used by other writers, though he still exists in the DC Universe and occasionally still appears in some DC Comics. His popularity amongst creators has led to many "cameos", sometimes with as little as his antennae being visible.

In the [[DC One Million]] series, Ambush Bug, or at least a version of him still sporting the same costume and mannerisms, appears of all places in [[Hong Kong]], [[China]], in the year 11021, working as a bartender, mentioning an attack by [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] substantially increased his insurance fees. Also, in the same series in ''[[Cameron Chase|Chase]] One Million'', an illegal user of superpower icons attempts to use Ambush Bug's Power Icon to teleport, and promptly ends up halfway through a wall.

In 2006, he appeared as part of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'s short-lived [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #24. He quips "Hello, room service? Send up a plot and three pages of dialogue right away! The weekly grind is tearin' me apart! Fifty-two!!!" This version of the Justice League of America ends after several people are murdered during a mission.

His powers appeared in proxy in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' #32. [[Jimmy Olsen]] briefly gains the appearance of Ambush Bug and subconsciously uses his power of "Dumb [[Luck]]" to locate [[Forager (comics)|Forager]].

He also was referenced in ''Superman/Batman Annual'' #1 in a throwaway caption near the end: "[[Darkseid]] played chess with Ambush Bug. Ambush Bug accidentally destroyed the universe with the 'Ultimate [[The Clapper|Clapper]].'"

After being championed by DC Coordinating Editor [[Jann Jones]], a new six-issue Ambush Bug miniseries, ''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'', debuted in 2008, plotted and pencilled by Giffen, and written by Fleming, with Jones herself serving as editor. The final issue was published almost a year after the rest of the series. [[Dan DiDio]] claims to have lost issue #6 and instead they skipped it to finish off with issue #7.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091102-Didio-10-Questions.html | title=10 Answers and One Question with DC's Dan DiDio | last=Rogers | first=Vaneta | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=November 2, 2009}}</ref>

Ambush Bug was seen in the new ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' series in 2010 at the end of issue #9, arriving with his luggage and Cheeks. He appeared semi-regularly until the series ended.

Ambush Bug made another appearance, in issue #46 of the outside of regular DC continuity ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' series, cover date January 2012.

Ambush Bug is now a news reporter in the feature "Channel 52" that appears in the back of all [[The New 52|New 52]] publications, in which characters acting as correspondents summarize recent events in an in-universe style. Ambush Bug, however, is the only character who appears in costume and, as is typical for his appearances since his creation, appears to understand that he is in a comic book.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comic Book Resources|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=43436|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>

==Powers and weapons==
[[Image:Action563 p.jpg|thumb|A series of panels describing Ambush Bug's suit being grafted to him. It also contains a reference to [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Venom (comics)|black]] costume.]]
Ambush Bug's primary power is teleportation. At first, this was a function of his suit; he was limited to teleporting to where small receiver bugs were located. Later, after an explosion, Ambush Bug internalized this power. It became apparent, in ''DC Comics Presents'' #81, that the Bug used to have to say "Simon says" to teleport, but it is no longer necessary. Ambush Bug is also aware of his fictionality and aware of events in other publishers' comic books. He once was shown being able to follow the internal dialogue between Firestorm's component personalities. Ambush Bug also shows surprising agility and skill at unarmed combat, such as gouging the eyes of enemies attacking him from behind or knocking out members of the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]] with a single blow. His unusual way of thinking is also a great advantage and often allows him to guess opponents' tactics and outmaneuver them, humiliating them in the process.

Despite all of this, Ambush Bug is simply a skinny man in the costume and can be defeated with surprising ease by more ridiculous characters. Serious foes, like [[Batman]] or [[Superman]], have great difficulty dealing with him, but other lunatics can duel with him easily.

==Other versions==

===Amalgam Comics===
In the continuity of [[Amalgam Comics]], '''Ambush the Lunatik''' is a combination of Ambush Bug and [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Lunatik]], an equally insane character, also created by Giffen. An intergalactic bounty hunter, his sole appearance is in ''Lobo the Duck'' #1 (April 1997).

===''Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl''===
In ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'', a heavily armored Ambush Bug is a member of a version of the [[Justice Society of America]] backed by [[Lex Luthor]] and led by [[Wonder Woman]].

==="Flashpoint"===
In the alternate timeline of the 2011 "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, the "Ambush Bugs" are a group of insect-themed heroes gathered together to fight the Amazons. Their members are [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]], [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], Cockroach, and Canterbury Cricket. All but the Canterbury Cricket are killed in a confrontation with the Amazons.<ref>''Flashpoint: The Cantebury Cricket'' (June 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
Ambush Bug appears in the series finale of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' titled "Mitefall!" voiced by [[Henry Winkler]]. Here, he tries to thwart [[Bat-Mite]]'s attempts to make the show [[jump the shark]] and force its cancellation while assisting Batman and [[Aquaman]] in fighting [[Gorilla Grodd]]. In the end, the executives do cancel the show. After Bat-Mite sees the trailer for the new Batman series, Ambush Bug appears next to Bat-Mite stating that because the upcoming series will be dark, Bat-Mite won't be in it. This causes this show's Bat-Mite to white out in the process. Ambush Bug helps organize a wrap party for the whole cast in the Bat Cave.

===Video games===
* Ambush Bug appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' voiced by Tracy W. Bush. He breaks the [[fourth wall]] by mentioning that he is in your "video game" and also allows both heroes and villains access to the Vault, a special room players can visit once a day to get money and clothes.
* In ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked]]'', he will occasionally appear in the Watchtower and state that he's in another game.
