'''Ambush Bug''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character who has appeared in several [[DC Comics]].  
His name is supposedly Irwin Schwab, but it must be noted that he suffers from mental problems that prevent him from truly understanding reality around him, so even his true identity might be no more than a delusion on his part. His origin is disputed, although the most commonly accepted origin is that Brum-El (a historical allusion to [[Beau Brummel]], as well as a reference to Superman's father [[Jor-El]]) of the planet Schwab sent his clothes from his supposedly doomed planet, hoping that his wardrobe would survive, only to have it intercepted by a giant radioactive space spider. In the resulting crash, only two articles of clothing survived: the Ambush Bug suit, which was subsequently found by Irwin Schwab, and Argh!Yle!, an argyle sock with a [[Dr. Doom]]-like complex, complete with metal mask.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} 

==Fictional biography==

Created by artist [[Keith Giffen]] as an intentionally silly character, Ambush Bug first appeared in several [[Superman]]-related comic books in the early 1980s. At first, Ambush Bug was a villain, named after a type of insect, and dressed in a green, skintight suit (with two orange antennae) that covered his whole body. Inside his hollow antennae, he carried miniature robot bugs that possessed the ability to [[teleport]] him around. After attacking Superman and other heroes (and being little more than an annoyance to them) Ambush Bug decided instead to be a [[superhero]] as well. He also fancied himself Superman's friend, which only annoyed the hero even more. The costume apparently then became permanently affixed to his body, and he gained the power to teleport by himself. (Again, it's unknown if this is true or just another delusion of his, as he is seen removing the costume at the end of his second mini-series.)

Ambush Bug became popular enough to be featured in two comic book miniseries and several specials, plotted and pencilled by Keith Giffen and scripted by [[Robert Loren Fleming]]. These became increasingly surreal, to the point that some don't consider them to be part of the [[DC Universe]]. The series also contains many comic book-enthusiast and DC in-jokes and satire; series editor [[Julius Schwartz]] is also a character in the book.

During his own 4-part series in 1985, he picked up a doll and, thinking it was alive, 'adopted' it as a partner called "Cheeks, The Toy Wonder," complete with its own costume. Also during this series, he fought a genuine bad guy named Scabbard (from ''[[Thriller (DC Comics)|Thriller]]'', a title co-created by Fleming), who left the story midway through after realizing Ambush Bug was a joke.

Ambush Bug is largely considered an absurd character {{Fact|date=April 2007}} and is rarely used by other writers, though he still exists in the DC Universe and occasionally still appears in some DC Comics.  His popularity amongst creators has led to many 'cameos', sometimes with as little as his antennae being visible. In the comics he has become something of a joke to other characters, and has been described as being to '''real''' heroes what [[Ed Wood Jr.]] was to [[Alfred Hitchcock]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}} 

Most recently, he appeared as part of [[Firestorm (Jason Rusch)|Firestorm]]'s short-lived [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' #24. He quips "Hello, room service? Send up a plot and three pages of dialogue right away! The weekly grind is tearin' me apart! Fifty-two!!!" This version of the JLA ends after several people are murdered during a mission.

He also was referenced in ''Superman/Batman Annual'' #1 in a throwaway caption near the end: "[[Darkseid]] played chess with Ambush Bug. Ambush Bug accidentally destroyed the universe with the 'Ultimate [[The Clapper|Clapper]].'"

==Powers and weapons==

Ambush Bug's main power is teleportation. At first, this was a function of his suit; Ambush Bug was limited to teleporting to where small receiver bugs were located. Later, after an explosion, Ambush Bug internalized this power. He has been seen using a large futuristic gun in one appearance. Ambush Bug is also aware of his fictionality, and even events in other publishers' comic books.

==Awards==
The character and series he has named for him have won recognition in the comics industry, including nominations for the R.A.C. [[Squiddy Awards|"Squiddy" Award]] for Favorite Limited Series and the R.A.C. "Squiddy" Award for Favorite Graphic Novel in 1992 for the Ambush Bug Nothing Special.  The character was also nominated for the R.A.C. "Squiddy" Award for Favorite Character in 1992.
