'''Doctor Druid''', also known as '''Doctor Droom''' and '''Druid''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[supernatural]] [[monster]]-[[hunter]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He starred in his own continuing feature debuting in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' Vol. 1, #1. Co-created by [[writer]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Jack Kirby]], he predates ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' #1, establishing him as '''Marvel's first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] [[superhero]]'''.

Doctor Druid's real name is Dr. Anthony Ludgate, although he usually refers to himself as Dr. Anthony Druid for effect.  He is a minor [[telepath]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magician]], specializing mostly in [[hypnosis]] and other feats of [[mesmerism]].  He is a trained [[psychiatrist]] and an expert on the [[occult]], trained by a [[Tibetan]] [[lama]] who'd come to the [[U.S.]] for [[medical]] attention (later [[retconned]] as the [[Ancient One]], the same sorcerer who trained [[Doctor Strange]]). Ludgate was later revealed to be a distant descedant of [[Amergin]] the [[Druid]].

==Introduction as Doctor Droom==
In his earliest appearances, in the first six issues of [[1961]]'s ''Amazing Adventures'', Doctor Druid was introduced as Doctor Droom.  More a monster-story appendage than a serious attempt at creating a three-dimensional character in the manner of the upcoming [[Spider-Man]] or [[Fantastic Four]], Doctor Droom vanished into obscurity for years after the series was retitled and reformatted as ''[[Amazing Adult Fantasy]]'' with #7. He resurfaced in the [[1970s]] as a guest character in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', where he was retitled Doctor Druid to avoid confusion with the far more recognizable [[Doctor Doom]].

==Revival as Doctor Druid==
Doctor Druid remained on the sidelines for years, but eventually joined the ranks of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].  His membership in that team was tainted when he was [[mind control]]led by the [[supervillain]]ess called the [[Terminatrix (comics)|Terminatrix]] (at the time impersonating the [[space pirate]] [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]) into manipulating the team on her behalf.  Her control on the team was weakened during a [[time travel]] adventure, and when "Nebula" was cast into [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]], Druid followed, as he was still under her thrall.  He eventually regained control of his own mind and returned to present-day [[Earth]].

Due to his actions as the villain's thrall, Druid was disgraced.  He was briefly reunited with his former teammates while working with Doctor Strange during the [[Infinity War]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]], and later became leader of the [[Secret Defenders]].  In that role, he was once again victimized by a villain's mind control, this time by a [[demon]] named Slorioth.  Doctor Druid and the demon were defeated, Druid faked his own death, and the team disbanded.

Restyling himself as a straightforward magician called "Druid", he went insane, was betrayed by his allies, and was finally killed by [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the putative Son of Satan.  Druid's ghost appeared later alongside the spirits of other dead ex-Avengers, confirming that Druid had in fact died this time.<!--
