'''Doctor Druid''', also known as '''Doctor Droom''' and '''Druid''', is a [[fictional character]], a sometime [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' volume 1 #1.

Doctor Druid's real name is Dr. Anthony Ludgate, although he usually refers to himself as Dr. Anthony Druid for effect.  He is a [[magic (paranormal)|magician]], specializing mostly in [[hypnosis]] and other feats of [[mesmerism]].  He is a trained [[psychiatrist]] and an expert on the [[occult]].  He was trained by the Ancient One, the same sorcerer who trained [[Doctor Strange]].

In his earliest appearances, in the first six issues of ''Amazing Adventures'', Doctor Druid was called Doctor Droom.  Doctor Droom's adventures in that series predated ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #1 by only a few months, but were nevertheless the first ongoing serial published by Marvel during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].  Despite this fact, Droom was forgotten, and would not reappear until years later, in the pages of ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', where he was retitled Doctor Druid to avoid confusion with the far more recognizable [[Doctor Doom]].

Doctor Druid remained on the sidelines for years, but eventually joined the ranks of [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].  His membership in that team was tainted when he was [[mind control]]led by the [[supervillain]]ess called the [[Terminatrix (comics)|Terminatrix]] (at the time impersonating the [[space pirate]] [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]) into manipulating the team on her behalf.  Her control on the team was weakened during a [[time travel]] adventure, and when "Nebula" was cast into [[Limbo]], Druid followed, as her was still under her thrall.  He eventually regained control of his own mind and returned to present-day Earth.

Due to his actions as the villain's thrall, Druid was disgraced.  He was briefly reunited with his former teammates while working with Doctor Strange during the [[Infinity War]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]], and later became the leader of the [[Secret Defenders]].  As leader of the Secret Defenders, he was once again the victim of a villain's mind control, although this time a [[demon]] named Slorioth was the controller.  Doctor Druid and the demon were defeated, Druid faked his own death, and the team disbanded.  Restyling himself as a straightforward magician called "Druid", he went insane, was betrayed by his allies, and was finally killed by [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of Satan.  Druid's ghost appeared later alongside the spirits of other dead ex-Avengers, confirming that Druid had in fact died this time.
