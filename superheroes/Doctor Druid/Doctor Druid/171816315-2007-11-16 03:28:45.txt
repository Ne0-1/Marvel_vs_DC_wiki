Co-created by [[writer]]-[[editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], he starred in his own continuing feature that debuted in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #1 (June 1961) &ndash; predating Lee & Kirby's milestone creation ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (Nov. 1961) and establishing him as Marvel's first [[superhero]] of the mid-1950s and 1960s period known as the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. 

==Publication history==

In his earliest five appearances, in ''Amazing Adventures'' #1-4 & #6 (June-Sept. & Nov. 1961), Doctor Druid was introduced as Doctor Droom. More a monster-story appendage than a serious attempt at creating a three-dimensional character in the manner of the upcoming [[Spider-Man]] or [[Fantastic Four]], Doctor Droom vanished into obscurity for years after the series was retitled and reformatted as ''[[Amazing Adult Fantasy]]'' with #7. He resurfaced in the 1970s as a guest character in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', where he was retitled Doctor Druid to avoid confusion with the far more recognizable [[Doctor Doom]].

He starred in the [[miniseries]] ''Druid'' #1-4 (May-Aug. 1995), by writer [[Warren Ellis]] and artist [[Leonardo Manco]], and co-starred with [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] and others in the flashback title ''Marvel Universe'' #4-7 (Sept.-Dec. 1998). There he was [[retconned]] as a member of the group the [[Monster Hunters]], whose adventures took place at the crux between the "[[Atlas Comics (1950s)#Pre-superhero Marvel|Age of Monsters]]" and "Age of Heroes".


==Fictional character biography==
Doctor Druid's real name is Dr. Anthony Ludgate Druid, although he usually refers to himself as Dr. Anthony Druid for effect.  He is a [[psychiatrist]], as well as a minor [[telepath]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magician]], specializing mostly in [[hypnosis]] and other feats of [[mesmerism]]. He has minor magical abilities that have varied over the years.  He is also an expert on the [[occult]], having been trained by a [[Tibet]]an [[lama]] who'd come to the [[U.S.]] for [[medical]] attention (later [[retconned]] as the [[Ancient One]],<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #37 (Oct. 1990)</ref> the same sorcerer who trained [[Doctor Strange]]). Ludgate was later revealed to be a distant descendant of the real-life [[Amergin]] the [[Druid]].

Doctor Druid remained on the sidelines for years, but eventually joined the ranks of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] after helping to defend [[Avengers Mansion]] from an attack by [[Baron Zemo]].  His membership was tainted when he was [[mind control]]led by [[supervillain]]ess the [[Terminatrix (comics)|Terminatrix]] (at the time impersonating the [[space pirate]] [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]) into manipulating the team on her behalf. When "Nebula" was cast into [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]], Druid followed, as he was still under her thrall.  He eventually regained control of his own mind and returned to Earth, where, after learning his true origin, banished "Nebula" and became younger by magic.

Due to his actions as the villain's thrall, Druid was disgraced.  He was briefly reunited with his former teammates while working with [[Doctor Strange]] during the [[Infinity War]], and later became leader of the [[Secret Defenders]]. In that role, he was once again victimized by a villain's mind-control, this time by the [[demon]] Slorioth.  Doctor Druid and the demon were defeated, Druid faked his own death, and the team disbanded.

Restyling himself as a straightforward magician called "Druid", he went insane, was betrayed by his allies, and was finally killed by [[Daimon Hellstrom]], the putative Son of Satan.<ref>''Druid'' #4 (Aug. 1995)</ref> Druid's ghost appeared later alongside the spirits of other dead ex-Avengers, confirming that Druid had in fact died this time. The Avengers later placed a memorial statue of him in the garden of Avengers Mansion.
