'''Satana''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] half-demon appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She is the sister of [[Daimon Hellstrom]], also known as the '''Son of Satan'''.

Satana first appeared in ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #2 in October, 1973. She was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]].

==Fictional character biography==
Satana and Daimon were born in the fictional town of Greentown, [[Massachusetts]]. They are the half-human children of a [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]] who claimed to be the Biblical [[Satan]] (his true name would later be revealed as [[Marduk Kurios]]). Satana and her brother were groomed by their father to be evil, but [[Daimon Hellstrom|Daimon]] rejected these teachings, while Satana embraced them.

When Satana was still a child, her mother, Victoria Wingate, discovered her husband and children's true nature and was driven mad. Daimon was raised by servants, while Satana was taken to her father's particular [[Hell]]-dimension (of which there are many in the [[Marvel Universe]]) and taught [[black magic]]. As a reward for her devotion to him, Satana's father gave her a [[Familiar spirit|familiar]] named Exiter, with whom she formed a close bond. Satana began studying magic under her father and the demon Dansker. In Hell, her soul was bonded with an evil spirit called the '''Basilisk''' (not to be confused with the [[Basilisk (comics)#Basilisk (Basil Elks)|Basilisk]]) in order to increase her magical power.<ref>birth and childhood recounted in ''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 1 #13</ref>

As an adult, Satana was banished to Earth by the Four as a [[succubus]], draining the souls of men. When she does this, the victim's soul transforms into an ethereal butterfly; Satana then consumes its essence by eating it. She also possesses the ability to gain strength through the use of weapons that were used to kill a living being. In order to do this, she merely places a portion of her own blood on the chosen weapon. She used both her magic and sexual wiles to get the victims she needed.

[[Image:DeodatoSatana.jpg|left|thumb|Satana from the ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' series, drawn by [[Mike Deodato]].]]As a succubus, she stalked victims in New York, and then in Los Angeles she befriended a Satanist named Ruth Cummins. When Ruth was killed, Satana avenged Ruth's death by destroying Darkos Edge and Harry Gotham.<ref>''Vampire Tales'' #2-3</ref> She later battled the Four, a mystic cabal. During Satana's first time in the mortal dimension, she was attacked by Monsignor Jimmy Cruz and his band of soldiers. During this battle, Cruz summoned demons called the [[N'Garai]]. Exiter tried to fend them off but was killed trying to protect his mistress. Though she was too late to save her beloved Exiter, Satana gained her revenge by killing Cruz and consuming his soul.<ref>''Haunt of Horror'' #2, 4</ref> She confronted her father, who was disguised as Miles Gorney, and defied him by saving Michael Heron's soul from him.<ref>''Haunt of Horror'' #5</ref> Some time later, Satana was seemingly destroyed by her brother Daimon Hellstrom, but she defeated the demoness Kthara.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 1 #24</ref> She was transformed by the Camarilla of the N'Garai into a human, Judith Camber. She was restored to normal, and destroyed the Camarilla.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #7</ref>

Eventually, however, the demon she had been bonded to began to desire its freedom. The Basilisk managed to put a [[curse]] on [[Doctor Strange]], basically turning him into a [[werewolf]]. With the help of [[Spider-Man]], Satana was able to free Strange's soul from the curse, but the Basilisk was released in the process, and stabbed her in the back with a mystical blade. Satana died laughing, however, because their life-forces were still bound together; by killing her, the Basilisk had sealed its own fate as well. She had thus sacrificed her life to cure Strange of lycanthropy.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #81</ref>

As a supernatural being, however, Satana's death was not permanent. Her spirit returned to her father's realm of Hell for a time, until she and a cabal of demons arranged to have her soul (among others) placed into a soulless body on Earth. There she began to build her powers again, preparing to return to Hell and conquer her father's realm.<ref>''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' #8,10,12,20,21</ref>

At some point she apparently died again. In the short lived Marvel series ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'', Satana is resurrected again by Doctor Strange and teamed with two other magic-wielding females to defeat a powerful mystic enemy called the Hellphyr, which was a front for her father Marduk Kurios. According to that series, the three witches formed a coven in order to protect the ''Tome of Zhered-na'' (a powerful [[Book of Shadows]] belonging to the Kale family) from would-be thieves such as Doctor Strange.<ref>''Witches'' #1-4</ref>

After a brief cameo in ''[[Nick Fury]]'s [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]]'',<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #6</ref> Satana has been shown to have reverted back to her former wicked ways; reaping souls in Manhattan and plotting her father's overthrow from the comfort of a desecrated church. Despite her fatherly conflict, Satana revealed that for every mortal victim she takes, she must offer the 10th victim as supplication to her father.<ref>''Legion of Monsters: Satana'' 2007 (one-shot issue)</ref> The Hood seeks her out to find out more information about Dormammu.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Satana.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Satana from ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #3, drawn by [[Esteban Maroto]].]]Satana is a half-demon/half-human hybrid, and a [[succubus]]; she has some innate mystical abilities inherited from her father, as well as some granted her by him. As a succubus, she is able to extract and feed upon the psychic energy of human male souls to increase her abilities and magical power; for a time, Satana had to extract and feed upon the psychic energy of human souls periodically to survive. She has the ability to manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including inter-dimensional teleportation, levitation, and the projection of concussive bolts of eldritch energy in the form of "soulfire" or hellfire. She also had a limited ability to [[Hypnosis|hypnotize]] her victims and control their minds psionically. If she touches an object used to kill someone (like a knife or sword) she can absorb its "blood energy" to become stronger in proportion to the souls the weapon has taken. She also has superhuman strength. For a time, she had the ability to contain the Basilisk, a powerful demon, within her spirit and to release it to do her bidding and then return within herself. Satana also trained in the mystic arts and learned how to cast [[Magic (paranormal)|spells]] and perform [[witchcraft]]. She was trained by "[[Marduk Kurios|Satan]]" in the use of her demonic powers. 

==Other versions==
===The Supernaturals===
In a 4-part alternate reality mini-series, called ''The Supernaturals'', Satana is Melissa Ramos, a Catholic girl who is possessed by a demon. She is recruited by a magician named [[Brother Voodoo]], along with alternate versions of [[Werewolf by Night]], [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] to fight a mystical threat. This version of Satana has mystical control over fire, as well as the power to fly. Despite her demonic possession, she has a very pure soul, and was going to be offered as a sacrifice by a demon called the Jack 'O' Lantern, until she was saved by Werewolf by Night.
