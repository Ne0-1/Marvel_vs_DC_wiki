An attractive human-appearing Ms. Gsptlsnz appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' in the 1990s as the girlfriend of Mr. Mxyzptlk. Unlike her hyperactive, wild, and crazy partner she is more laid back and indifferent to mortals. As an Imp from the fifth dimension she shares the same powers as Mr. Mxyzptlk and isn't bound by third dimensional laws. She appeared in the episodes "Mxyzpixilated" and "Little Big Head Man".

Ms. Gsptlsnz is voiced by [[Sandra Bernhard]] ("Mxyzpixilated") and [[Jennifer Hale]] ("Little Big Head Man").
