'''Ms. Gsptlsnz''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɡ|ɪ|z|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|l|ɨ|z|n|ɨ|z}} {{respell|giz|PIT|ləz-nəz}}), sometimes called '''Gizpy''', is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] who appears in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. 

She appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' in the 1990s as the attractive girlfriend of Mr. [[Mxyzptlk]]. Unlike her hyperactive, wild and crazy partner she is more laid back and indifferent to mortals. As an Imp from the fifth dimension she shares the same powers as Mr. Mxyzptlk and isn't bound by third dimensional laws. She appeared in the episodes "Mxyzpixilated" and "Little Big Head Man".

Ms. Gsptlsnz is voiced by [[Sandra Bernhard]] (Episode "Mxyzpixilated") and [[Jennifer Hale]] (Episode "Little Big Head Man").

A character named Miss Gzptlsnz had previously appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]''. Ms. Gzptlsnz was a female fifth-dimensional imp who had a crush on [[Jimmy Olsen]], although Mxyzptlk referred to her as his girfriend. The character was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Curt Swan]], and first appeared in ''Jimmy Olsen'' #52 (April 1964). Unlike the human-appearing Ms. Gsptlsnz, Miss Gzptlsnz had similar implike proportions to Mxyzptlk. She reappeared in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #31 (July 1999) as the leader of a council of 5th dimensional imps passing judgement on [[Qwsp]].
