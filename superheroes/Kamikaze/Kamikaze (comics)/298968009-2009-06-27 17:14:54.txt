'''Kamikaze''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''New Mutants''  #93.

==Fictional character biography==
Kamikaze was recruited by [[Stryfe]] in [[Madripoor]] to join the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF) with [[Dragoness (comics)|Dragoness]] and [[Sumo (comics)|Sumo]] shortly after the team was created. The newly assembled team fought with the [[New Mutants]] who had the help of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]. Even with the extra help, the MLF is successful in [[kidnap]]ping several members of the New Mutants. However, their victory is quelled by the arrival of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] who tracks down and releases their captives.  With the help of their [[android]] [[Zero (comics)|Zero]], the MLF is able to escape.

However the New Mutants—now dubbed [[X-Force]] by their [[militant]] leader [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]—track them down to their hidden base. Kamikaze is one of the few members to engage X-Force while [[Stryfe]] sets up a self-[[detonation]] [[countdown]]. With only a few minutes left, Stryfe has Zero once again [[teleportation|teleport]] the team to safety.

As the events of the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' begin to unfold, the MLF finds itself collecting an array of ancient [[relic]]s. The team, including Kamikaze, split into strike forces to steal the various artifacts that will help [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] from his slumber. Later on, the New Mutants, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the [[X-Men]] discovered the latest MLF base in Dust Bowl, [[Arkansas]].<ref>''X-factor #85''</ref>

During the fray [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]], one of Kamikaze's teammates, threw the X-Man [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] into the air, allowing Kamikaze to sneak up on him from behind. But Archangel spread his then-metallic wings and accidentally [[decapitation|decapitated]] Kamikaze, whose head rolled through the battle to [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom (A.K.A. Tabitha Smith]]).

==Powers and abilities==
Kamikaze can fly, and also has enhanced strength, speed, stamina, and sturdiness as a result of his primary mutation which was to be a living bomb by exciting the atomic friction between molecules, allowing him to release explosive charges on physical impact, as well as detonate the airspace directly surrounding his body.
