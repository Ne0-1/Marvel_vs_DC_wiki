The '''Phantom Rider''' is the name of several [[Character (arts)|fictional characters]], [[Old West]] heroic [[gunfighter]]s appearing in [[comic book]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character name was originally called '''Ghost Rider''', and was changed following the introduction of Marvel's [[Ghost Rider (comics)|motorcycle-riding character]].

==Publication history==
Marvel's first Ghost Rider look was based on the [[Magazine Enterprises]] character Ghost Rider, created by writer [[Ray Krank]] and artist [[Dick Ayers]] for editor [[Vincent Sullivan]] in ''[[Tim Holt]]'' #11 (1949).  The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of ''Tim Holt'', ''Red Mask'', and ''A-1 Comics'' up until the institution of the [[Comics Code]].  After the trademark to the character's name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Feb. 1967), by writers [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gary Friedrich]] and original Ghost Rider artist Ayers. After this series ended with issue #7 (Nov. 1967), the character went on to appear in new stories in the omnibus title ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' (1970 series) and in new backup stories in the otherwise reprint title ''The Original Ghost Rider Rides Again''. <!--"and made occasional cameos elsewhere." Cameo appearances in other characters' titles, or occasional featurettes in which he starred?--> 

With the introduction of Marvel's supernatural Ghost Rider in the 1970s, Marvel renamed its Western Ghost Rider â€” first, to the unfortunate '''Night Rider''' (a term previously used in the [[Southern United States]] to refer to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]) in a 1974-1975 reprint series, and then to '''Phantom Rider'''.  At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was reprinted by [[AC Comics]] in the 1980s. While the copyrights have lapsed due to non-renewal, AC renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark.

==The Riders==
===Carter Slade===
'''Carter Slade''', the first to wear the mask, debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Feb. 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a phosphorescent white costume, complete with a full-face mask, cape, and the requisite white hat. Slade received his outfit and his white horse from '''Flaming Star''', a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] [[medicine man]].

He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after Slade's death that the name Phantom Rider was given to the character, and reprints now [[retcon|retroactively]] use that name for Slade.

Eventually, the modern era [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] Johnny Blaze found himself transported into the 19th century where he met and teamed up with Carter Slade. Carter was badly wounded and Blaze took him to Flaming Star to be healed and then dealt with Carter's enemies. Carter recovered and Johnny returned to the present.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, #50</ref>

Carter Slade's spirit however returned and possessed his descendant Hamilton Slade to make him a new Phantom Rider and rode out to rescue Johnny Blaze from certain doom.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 2, #56</ref>

===Jamie Jacobs and Lincoln Slade===
After Slade's death in ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972), his sidekick '''Jamie Jacobs''' became the second Phantom Rider. He was promptly killed in action, after which Slade's brother, U.S. Marshall '''Lincoln Slade''', became the third Phantom Rider.<ref>''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972)</ref> Lincoln Slade was driven mad, to the point that he used a potion to control and rape the time traveling [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].  Once the potion wore off, she fought and defeated him, but in the course of the battle he fell to his death from a cliff.<ref>''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' vol. 2, #23 (Aug. 1987)</ref>

===Reno Jones===
{{mainarticle|Gunhawks}}
In the miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'', the [[African American]] gunslinger '''Reno Jones''' used the Ghost Rider identity briefly in a battle with the Klan-affiliated mercenaries called the Nightriders.  Jones had been half of the team called the [[Gunhawks]], along with his former friend, [[Kid Cassidy]], whom Jones had believed dead.  Cassidy was revealed to be alive and the leader of the Nightriders; he was killed, and Jones retired.

===Hamilton Slade===
{{mainarticle|Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)}}
In present-day continuity, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' was an archaeologist who found the burial site of his legendary ancestor, in issue #56 of the [[supernatural]]-[[motorcyclist]] series ''Ghost Rider''. As he explored the site, he found a large burial urn and from it appeared the ghostly garb of his ancestors Carter and Lincoln Slade. Possessed by the spirits of his ancestors, he became the new version of the Phantom Rider, and rode off to rescue Johnny Blaze the current Ghost Rider from one of his foes.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #56</ref> However he would have no memory of his adventures as the Rider and eventually Lincoln's ghost would takeover more frequently and haunt Mockingbird for his death.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #31</ref> An exorcism released the spirits of Carter and Lincoln from Hamilton and Lincoln was defeated and banished while Hamilton agreed to have Carter possess him, only now Hamilton was in control and retained memory of his adventures as the Rider.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #41</ref>

===J.T.===
[[Nick Fury]] recruits Carter Slade's grandson, J.T., introduced in ''The Mighty Avengers'' #13, to be part of Fury's team against the "[[Secret Invasion]]" of the shape-shifting alien [[Skrull]]s. He has superhuman reflexes and the ability to cause a chain to ignite in flame and cause massive damage. The character roll call at the beginning of ''Secret Invasion'' #4 (Sept. 2008) refers to J.T. as "Hellfire".

===Jaime Slade===
In the pages of the series ''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'', Jaime is the daughter of Hamilton Slade and her ancestor was Lincoln. She works at a museum and upon entering an urn of her family, mysterious smoke emerged from it and transformed her into a new Phantom Rider with a grudge against Mockingbird. As the story progresses it is indeed the vengeful spirit of Lincoln Slade having been drawn back by the return of Mockingbird. Lincoln has possessed Jaime Slade and this version of the Phantom Rider would team up with Hawkeye's old foe, Crossfire, to torment Mockingbird and kill her thus reuniting with her in the hereafter forever. After badly wounding Mockingbird's mother and leaving Mockingbird, Hawkeye and Dominic Fortune for dead, the Rider and Crossfire return to Crossfire's base. However the Rider soon scans the hereafter with his senses and realizes they are not dead. Mockingbird and Hawkeye spring their own trap and lure Crossfire and the Rider to Spirit Peak for a final confrontation. They are then joined by Hamilton Slade who summons the spirit and power of Carter Slade to become the true Phantom Rider. Hamilton prepares an exorcism spell that not only draws Lincoln from Jamie but also Carter from Hamilton! The two spirits are drawn into an urn with the intent that Carter's spirit would heal Lincoln's and they could both rest in peace. Jamie recovers and attacks on her own and is subdued. However Hamilton picks up the urn and says the ritual isn't finished yet and begins to walk away when he is mortally wounded by Crossfire and drops the urn. As Hawkeye deals with Crossfire, Mockingbird attempts to save Hamilton but he assures her that he is finished and that with his death his own spirit can also keep Lincoln from returning. As Hamilton dies, Jamie is consumed by rage and transforms back into the Rider only this time apparently without Lincoln's spirit in her. The fight is brief and Mockingbird defeats her and she is taken into custody by Steve Rogers in his role as the new head of SHIELD.<ref>''Hawkeye & Mockingbird'' #1-5 </ref>

==In other media==
* In the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'', actor [[Sam Elliott]] plays Carter Slade, also known as [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]],<!--"Caretaker" in onscreen credits--> though they are not the same characters in the comic book series. In the movie version of the story, Slade is Johnny's predecessor, who 150 years ago did not deliver a contract of hellbound souls to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]]. In the modern day, Slade awaits the arrival of the next Ghost Rider so he can be freed of his curse. Bearing little resemblance to the actual Phantom Rider, this version is instead a skeleton in a cowboy outfit riding a skeletal horse.
* The [[video game]] ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' has a Phantom Rider costume (labeled "Western") as one of the alternate outfits for the Ghost Rider character. While wearing this alternate costume, Ghost Rider retains his original move set, but when paired with other such characters in specific alternate costumes (e.g. [[Iron Man]] wearing the [[War Machine]] costume), the team is referred to as "Alternate Identities".
<!--==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Marvel Comics]]-[[DC Comics]] [[intercompany crossover]] series of [[one-shot (comics)|one shots]], [[Amalgam Comics]], Carter Slade is combined with [[Jay Garrick]].
