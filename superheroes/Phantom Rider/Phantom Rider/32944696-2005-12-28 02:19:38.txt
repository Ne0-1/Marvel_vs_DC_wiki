The '''Phantom Rider''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[Old West]] heroic [[gunfighter]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was initially called the [[Ghost Rider]], but after the appearance of Marvel's supernatural Ghost Riders in the 1970s,  this character's name was changed first to the unfortunate [[Night Rider]] (a name that also refers to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]) in a 1974-1975 reprint series, and then to [[Phantom Rider]].  At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

'''Carter Slade''', the first to wear the mask, debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Feb. 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a luminescent white costume, complete with a mask and the requisite white hat. Slade received his outfit and his white horse from a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] [[medicine man]].

He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after Slade's death that the name Phantom Rider was given to the character, and reprints now retroactively use that name for Slade.

After Slade's death in ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972), his sidekick '''Jamie Jacobs''' became the second Phantom Rider. He was promptly killed in action, after which Slade's brother, U.S. Marshall '''Lincoln Slade''', became the third Phantom Rider.  Lincoln Slade was driven mad, to the point that he used a [[potion]] to [[mind control|control]] and [[rape]] the [[time travel]]ing [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].  Once the potion wore off, she fought and defeated him, but in the course of the battle he fell to his death from a cliff.

In the miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'', the [[African American]] gunslinger '''[[Reno Jones]]''' used the Ghost Rider identity briefly in a battle with the Klan-affiliated mercenaries called the Nightriders.  Jones had been half of the team called the [[Gunhawks]], along with his former friend, [[Kid Cassidy]], whom Jones had believed dead.  Cassidy was revealed to be alive and the leader of the Nightriders, and was killed.

In present-day continuity, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' received the Phantom Rider's equipment and became a costumed adventurer, as seen in issue #56 (May 1981) of the [[supernatural]]-[[motorcyclist]] series ''Ghost Rider''. He was possessed for a time by his ancestor's [[ghost]], but was freed with the assistance of the [[West Coast Avengers]].  Carter Slade's ghost is now the spirit that guides him.  He has since become involved with the [[superhero]] team [[The Rangers (comics)|The Rangers]].
