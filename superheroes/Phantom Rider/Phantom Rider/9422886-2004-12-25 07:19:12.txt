The '''Phantom Rider''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was initially called the [[Ghost Rider]], but after the appearance of subsequent Ghost Riders in the [[1970s]], the character's name was changed, first to the Night Rider and later to the Phantom Rider.  No less than five men have worn the Phantom Rider's mask; four of them were active in the [[Wild West]], and last is active in the modern day.

'''Carter Slade''', the first to wear the mask, was a [[cowboy]] who first appeared in ''Ghost Rider'' (1967 series) #1, and as a [[gunfighter]] battled evil while dressed in a luminescent white costume, complete with a mask and the requisite white hat.  He received his outfit and his white horse from a [[Native American]] [[medicine man]].  Slade was never called the Phantom Rider in his original appearances; his original adventures called him the "Ghost Rider", and later reprints renamed him the "Night Rider" to avoid confusion with Marvel's other [[Ghost Rider]].  It wasn't until Slade's death that the name "Phantom Rider" was chosen, as the term "Night Rider" has connotations with the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and retroactive stories have had Slade called the "Phantom Rider".

After Carter's death in ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' (1970 series) #7, his sidekick '''Jamie Jacobs''' became the second Phantom Rider but was promptly killed in action, after which Carter's brother, U.S. Marshall '''Lincoln Slade''', became the third Phantom Rider.  Lincoln was driven mad, to the point that he used a [[potion]] to [[mind control|control]] and [[rape]]d the [[time travel]]ing [[The Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Mockingbird (comics)|Mockingbird]].  Once the potion wore off, she fought and defeated him, but in the course of the battle he fell to his death from a cliff.

In the miniseries ''[[Apache Skies]]'', the [[African American]] gunslinger '''[[Reno Jones]]''' used the Phantom Rider identity briefly.

In the modern day, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' received the Phantom Rider's equipment and became a costumed adventurer, as seen in ''Ghost Rider'' volume 2 #56.  He was possessed for a time by his ancestor's [[ghost]], but was freed with the assistance of the [[West Coast Avengers]].  He has since become involved with the [[superhero]] team called [[The Rangers (comics)|The Rangers]].
