The '''Phantom Rider''' is the name of several [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[Old West]] heroic [[gunfighter]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character name was originally called '''Ghost Rider''', and was changed following the introduction of Marvel's [[Ghost Rider (comics)|motorcycle-riding character]] of the same name.

==Publication history==
Marvel's first Ghost Rider look was based on the television series [[Lone Ranger]] and the [[Magazine Enterprises]] character Ghost Rider, created by writer [[Ray Krank]] and artist [[Dick Ayers]] for editor [[Vincent Sullivan]] in ''Tim Holt'' #11 (1949).  The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of ''Tim Holt'', ''Red Mask'', and ''A-1 Comics'' up until the institution of the [[Comics Code]].  After the trademark to the character's name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 1, #1 (Feb. 1967), by writers [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gary Friedrich]] and original Ghost Rider artist Ayers. After this series ended with issue #7 (Nov. 1967), the character went on to appear in new stories in the omnibus title ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' (1970 series) and in new backup stories in the otherwise reprint title ''The Original Ghost Rider Rides Again''. <!--"and made occasional cameos elsewhere." Cameo appearances in other characters' titles, or occasional featurettes in which he starred?--> 

With the introduction of Marvel's supernatural Ghost Rider in the 1970s, Marvel renamed its Western Ghost Rider â€” first, to the unfortunate '''Night Rider''' (a term previously used in the [[Southern United States]] to refer to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]) in a 1974-1975 reprint series, and then to '''Phantom Rider'''.  At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was reprinted by [[AC Comics]] in the 1980s. While the copyrights have lapsed due to non-renewal, AC renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark.

==The Riders==
===Carter Slade===
'''Carter Slade''', the first to wear the mask, debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Feb. 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a phosphorescent white costume, complete with a full-face mask, cape, and the requisite white hat. Slade received his outfit and his white horse from '''Flaming Star''', a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] [[medicine man]].

He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after Slade's death that the name Phantom Rider was given to the character, and reprints now [[retcon|retroactively]] use that name for Slade.

Carter Slade's spirit appeared in modern times to aid that era's first [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #50</ref>

===Jamie Jacobs and Lincoln Slade===
After Slade's death in ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972), his sidekick '''Jamie Jacobs''' became the second Phantom Rider. He was promptly killed in action, after which Slade's brother, U.S. Marshall '''Lincoln Slade''', became the third Phantom Rider.<ref>''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972)</ref> Lincoln Slade was driven mad, to the point that he used a [[potion]] to [[mind control|control]] and [[rape]] the [[time travel]]ing [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].  Once the potion wore off, she fought and defeated him, but in the course of the battle he fell to his death from a cliff.<ref>''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' vol. 2, #23 (Aug. 1987)</ref>

===Reno Jones===
In the miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'', the [[African American]] gunslinger '''[[Reno Jones]]''' used the Ghost Rider identity briefly in a battle with the Klan-affiliated mercenaries called the Nightriders.  Jones had been half of the team called the [[Gunhawks]], along with his former friend, [[Kid Cassidy]], whom Jones had believed dead.  Cassidy was revealed to be alive and the leader of the Nightriders; he was killed, and Jones retired.

===Hamilton Slade===
In present-day continuity, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant '''[[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Hamilton Slade]]''' was an archaeologist who found the burial site of his legendary ancestor, in issue #56 of the [[supernatural]]-[[motorcyclist]] series ''Ghost Rider''. As he explored the site, he found a large burial urn and from it appeared the ghostly garb of his ancestors Carter and Lincoln Slade. Possessed by the spirits of his ancestors, he became the new version of the Phantom Rider.

===J.T.===
[[Nick Fury]] recruits Carter Slade's grandson, J.T., introduced in ''The Mighty Avengers'' #13, to be part of Fury's team against the "[[Secret Invasion]]" of the shape-shifting alien [[Skrull]]s. He has superhuman reflexes and the ability to cause a chain to ignite in flame and cause massive damage. The character roll call at the beginning of ''Secret Invasion'' #4 (Sept. 2008) refers to J.T. as "Hellfire".

==In other media==
* In the 2007 film ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'', actor [[Sam Elliott]] plays Carter Slade, also known as [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]],<!--"Caretaker" in onscreen credits--> though they are not the same characters in the comic book series. In the movie version of the story, Slade is Johnny's predecessor, who 150 years ago did not deliver a contract of hellbound souls to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]]. In the modern day, Slade awaits the arrival of the next Ghost Rider so he can be freed of his curse. Bearing little resemblance to the actual Phantom Rider, this version is instead a skeleton in a cowboy outfit riding a skeletal horse.
* The [[video game]] ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' has a Phantom Rider costume (labeled "Western") as one of the alternate outfits for the Ghost Rider character. While wearing this alternate costume, Ghost Rider retains his original move set, but when paired with other such characters in specific alternate costumes (e.g. [[Iron Man]] wearing the [[War Machine]] costume), the team is referred to as "Alternate Identities".
<!--==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Marvel Comics]]-[[DC Comics]] [[intercompany crossover]] series of [[one-shot (comics)|one shots]], [[Amalgam Comics]], Carter Slade is combined with [[Jay Garrick]].
