The '''Phantom Rider''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]], [[Old West]] heroic [[gunfighter]]s in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character name was originally the '''Ghost Rider''', and was changed following the introduction of Marvel's [[Ghost Rider|motorcycle-riding supernatural character]] of the same name.

Marvel's first Ghost Rider was patterned after the [[Magazine Enterprises]] character Ghost Rider, created by writer [[Ray Krank]] and artist [[Dick Ayers]] for editor [[Vincent Sullivan]] in ''Tim Holt'' #11 (1949).  The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of ''Tim Holt'', ''Red Mask'' and ''A-1 Comics'' up until the institution of the [[Comics Code]].  After the trademark to the character's name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 1, #1 (Feb. 1967), by writers [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gary Friedrich]] and original Ghost Rider artist Ayers. After this series ended with issue #7 (Nov. 1967), the character went on to appear in new stories in the [[omnibus (media)|omnibus]] title ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' (1970 series) and in new backup stories in the otherwise reprint title ''The Original Ghost Rider Rides Again''. <!--"and made occasional cameos elsewhere." Cameo appearances in other characters' titles, or occasional featurettes in which he starred?--> 

With the introduction of Marvel's supernatural Ghost Rider in the 1970s, Marvel renamed its Western Ghost Rider â€” first, to the unfortunate '''Night Rider''' (a term previously used in the [[Southern United States]] to refer to members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]) in a 1974-1975 reprint series, and then to '''Phantom Rider'''.  At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.

The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was acquired by [[AC Comics]] in the 1980s. The company renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark.
==The Riders==
===Carter Slade===
'''Carter Slade''', the first to wear the mask, debuted in ''Ghost Rider'' #1 (Feb. 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a luminescent white costume, complete with a mask and the requisite white hat. Slade received his outfit and his white horse from a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] [[medicine man]].

He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after Slade's death that the name Phantom Rider was given to the character, and reprints now [[retcon|retroactively]] use that name for Slade.

===Jamie Jacobs and Lincoln Slade===
After Slade's death in ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #7 (Jan. 1972), his sidekick '''Jamie Jacobs''' became the second Phantom Rider. He was promptly killed in action, after which Slade's brother, U.S. Marshall '''Lincoln Slade''', became the third Phantom Rider.  Lincoln Slade was driven mad, to the point that he used a [[potion]] to [[mind control|control]] and [[rape]] the [[time travel]]ing [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].  Once the potion wore off, she fought and defeated him, but in the course of the battle he fell to his death from a cliff.

===Reno Jones===
In the miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'', the [[African American]] gunslinger '''[[Reno Jones]]''' used the Ghost Rider identity briefly in a battle with the Klan-affiliated mercenaries called the Nightriders.  Jones had been half of the team called the [[Gunhawks]], along with his former friend, [[Kid Cassidy]], whom Jones had believed dead.  Cassidy was revealed to be alive and the leader of the Nightriders; he was killed, and Jones retired.

===Hamilton Slade===
In present-day continuity, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant '''Hamilton Slade''' was an archaeologist who found the burial site of his legendary ancestor, in issue #56 of the [[supernatural]]-[[motorcyclist]] series ''Ghost Rider''. As he explored the site he found a large burial urn and from it appeared the ghostly garb of his ancestors Carter and Lincoln Slade. Possessed by the spirits of his ancestors, he became the new version of the Phantom Rider.

==Other media==
The [[video game]] ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance]]'' has a Phantom Rider costume as one of the alternate "skins" for the character Ghost Rider.
