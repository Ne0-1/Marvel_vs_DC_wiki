==Publication history==
[[Fabian Nicieza]] said that he added Sprocket to the New Warriors cast "because there's no way I'm going to let those kids fly their own helicopter! It would be too ''[[Speed Racer]]''-ish, having these teenagers zooming around in a helicopter and such."<ref>{{cite journal |last=McElhatton |first=Greg |date=January 1993 |title=The Busiest Man in Comics |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |volume= |issue=17 |pages=42â€“45 |publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]}}</ref>
