'''Universo''' is the name of two [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] [[supervillain]]s in the [[DC Comics]] universe.

==Pre-Zero Hour==
The original Universo first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #349 (Oct 1966) as a powerful hypnotist. With his "Hypno Stone", he was able to control the head of the Time Institute, and lure the Legionnaires into a series of traps. The Legion defeated him with the help of a Time Cube invented by [[Rond Vidar]], who was subsequently revealed to be Universo's son.

A later [[retcon]] would reveal that Universo was a former member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] who was assigned to prevent the Legion viewing the Dawn of Time, but attempted to do so himself, and was stripped of his ring by the [[Guardians of the Universe]]. Rond Vidar would later acquire his power ring.

==Post-Zero Hour==
Following the rebooting of Legion history in [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] Universo was reinvented as '''Sarmon Ardeen''', [[Saturn Girl]]'s cousin. He first appeared in the Legion/[[Titans (comics)|Titans]] crossover ''Universe Ablaze'' (March 2000), set in an [[alternate timeline]] in which the Titans were in suspended animation until the 31st century. He joined forces with a recreated [[Brother Blood|Cult of Blood]] to take control of the Titans. When this timeline was negated, the real timeline had him imprisoned on his home moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

After the return of the "Legion Lost" from the Second Galaxy, Universo made an attempt to control Saturn Girl, and the Titanet telepathic communication network. This failed, and Saturn Girl left his mind in the same fantasy scenario he had created for her.
