==Fictional character biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Accounts differ on how exactly Captain Wonder got his powers, but the basic story is that Professor Jordan invented a miracle drug that gave the user the strength of twelve men.  A young man named [[Tim Mulrooney]] somehow ended up at his laboratory, where the Professor was to show him the drug.  However, there was an accident in which the vial containing the drug was dropped, causing Tim and Jordan to pass out, with Tim saving Jordan's life.  When they awoke, Jordan had superhuman strength, and Tim may or may not have had the same power.  Jordan decided to use his powers as a superhero, fighting crime and the Nazis.  He took Tim as his sidekick.

===The Twelve===
{{Main|The Twelve (comics)}}
Captain Wonder is among the heroes who fought the Nazis at the end of World War II and while searching a base, was captured and put in suspended animation.

When they are awoken 60 years later, Captain Wonder is one of the two who discover that it is the 21st Century.  He also discovers that his wife died 20 years earlier and his two sons were killed in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="The Twelve #1"/> Later he meets his old sidekick, now an old man who commits suicide rather than die from cancer.<ref>''The Twelve'' #7</ref> Captain Wonder is badly burnt when fighting Dynamic Man.<ref>The Twelve #11, 2012</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Wonder had, at one time, been described as having "the strength of twelve men."{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} This power level has clearly been revised in modern times, since Captain Wonder has recently demonstrated sufficient strength and flying power to carry a damaged space shuttle, an object with thousands of tons of mass.{{Or|date=November 2009}}
