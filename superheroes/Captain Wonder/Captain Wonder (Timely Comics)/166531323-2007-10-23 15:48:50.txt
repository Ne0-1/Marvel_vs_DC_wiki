'''Captain Wonder''' ('''Professor Jordan''') is a fictional character from the[[Timely Comics]]/[[Marvel Comics]] universe.  He is superhero who possesses the power of super strength. He first appeared in ''Kid Komics'' #1 in February [[1943 in comics|1943]].

==Publication history==
He appeared in ''Kid Komics #1-2''.  He made the cover of ''Kid Komics #1'', but by #2 he had faded into the shadow cast by the [[Young Allies]], and he disappeared altogether in issue #3.

He will return in ''[[The Twelve (comic)|The Twelve]]''.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11312 Mystery Men's Dozen: Brevoort Talks "The Twelve"], July 26, 2007, [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref> <ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=123753 12 Days of the Twelve: Captain Wonder], August 2, 2007, [[Newsarama]]</ref> 
===Comparison to Captain America===
Besides the obvious link of his name, '''Captain Wonder''' has other similarities to [[Captain America]], and may have been a rip-off that character.  There are some uniform similarities, they both fought against the [[Axis powers]], and the origins are very similar.

==Fictional character biography==
Accounts differ on how exactly Captain Wonder got his powers, but the basic story is that Professor Jordan invented a miracle drug that gave the user the strength of twelve men.  A young man named [[Tim Mulrooney]] somehow ended up at his laboratory, where the Professor was to show him the drug.  However, there was an accident in which the vial containing the drug was dropped, causing Tim and Jordan to pass out, with Tim saving Jordan's life.  When they awoke, Jordan had superhuman strength, and Tim may or may not have had the same power.  Jordan decided to use his powers as a superhero, fighting crime and the Nazis.  He took Tim as his sidekick.

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Wonder possessed "the strength of twelve men."  Judging by the [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]], this works out to be the ability to lift about 960 lbs.
