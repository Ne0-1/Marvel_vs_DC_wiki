'''Psycho-Man''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] from [[Marvel Comics]], created by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]].  He is primarily a foe of the [[Fantastic Four]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Psycho-Man is a [[mad scientist]], the leader of a [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] that governed a system of worlds within a [[Microverse]], where he is the chief scientist of the planet Traan.  Facing overpopulation, he determined that it would be easier to cross [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|other dimensions]] than to travel to other systems.  Deciding that Earth would be an ideal target due to its inhabitants vulnerabilities to his unique weaponry, he used scientific means to enter the normal-sized universe, though he was only able to achieve [[microscopic]] size in this world and has to resort to a human-sized, armored [[exoskeleton]] to interact with anything not on a microscopic scale.

Using a portable device capable of influencing people's emotions, Psycho-Man used a number of human subjects to build a larger-scale version of the machine, one capable of covering the world with its emotion-influencing rays.  This effort was thwarted by the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], several members of the [[Inhumans]] royal family, and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and Psycho-Man was forced to retreat back to the Microverse.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5</ref>  He was subsequently followed by the Human Torch, the Thing, and [[Mister Fantastic]], who had traveled to Sub-Atomica in search of the [[Silver Surfer]], and were forced to let Psycho-Man go in order to deal with a greater threat, [[Galactus]], back in their own dimension.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #76-77</ref>  Psycho-Man later faced the Fantastic Four again, as well as a group called the [[Micronauts]] who were native to his home dimension, by which time he claimed to be in exile from his home-world.<ref>''Micronauts'' Vol. 1 #15-16</ref>

Infuriated by his defeat at the hands of the Fantastic Four, Psycho Man became increasingly obsessed in finding the [[Uni-Power]]. He planned to steal the Uni-Power, become Captain Universe and then travel to Earth where he would exact his revenge. He scoured the Universe and captured hundreds of people who had been Captain Universe, however by the time he got to them the Uni-Power had moved on. It ended however when the Psycho-Man captured Spider-Man, who broke free and led a revolt against Psycho-Man with the other previous Captain Universe hosts and eventually defeated the villain, leading him to be tossed from his own ship while his former captives took possession of it.{{issue}}

Eventually he returns to Earth and gives up on finding Captain Universe, so he uses an [[android]] known as H.M. Unger (also known as the [[Hate-Monger]]) instead; to stimulate hatred among the population of New York City through demagoguery and chemically-treated pamphlets.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #279</ref>  The Hate-Monger also succeeds in turning [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm Richards]] into the hateful warrior [[Malice (comics)#Malice (split personality)|Malice]], sending her to destroy her teammates.  After her husband [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] succeeds in freeing Susan of her conditioning, the Fantastic Four pursues the Psycho-Man back to his home dimension of Sub-Atomica once more, where they found they had conquered a kingdom ruled by their friend [[Queen Pearla]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #280-283</ref>  There Susan Richards -- who came to realize that she was much powerful that she had previously believed -- confronts Psycho-Man and uses his own emotion-control device on him by subjecting him to all three emotions simultaneously at maximum intensity, collapsing his nervous system. The entire experience profoundly affects Susan on a fundamental level, and prompts her to change her code name from "Invisible Girl" to "[[Invisible Woman]]".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #284</ref>

Psycho-Man appeared later, to confront Spider-Man, [[Shadowcat]], [[Douglock]] and others. Spider-man's experience helped the group escape his influence.{{issue}}

He would also become involved with [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]] III and his evil alternate-universe future-self, Fredd.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #15-16 (Mar. - Apr. 2001)</ref>

Some time later, a terminally ill Psycho-Man once again manages to enter Earth.  He uses his emotion-manipulating abilities not only to affect the millions of people in [[Manhattan]], but also to create physical manifestations of their worst fears.  Because of her previous encounter with him, the Invisible Woman has maintained a latent psychic connection to Psycho-Man.  She uses it to defeat him, and the siege of Manhattan comes to an end.<ref>''Marvel Knights 4'' #10-12</ref>  Subsequently, cured and healthy, he confronts the newest incarnation of the Fantastic Four -- the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], the Thing and the Human Torch -- after a teleportation accident apparently send them to Sub-Atomica. Despite his best efforts, he is unable to break the wills of the newlywed Black Panther and Storm, and he is ultimately defeated.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #31 (Dec. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Though lacking superpowers, Psycho-Man possesses superhuman-level intelligence and advanced scientific knowledge. He possesses extensive knowledge of technology far in advance of present-day Earth's.

The Psycho-Man's main weapon is a portable emotion-controlling device that projects a ray capable of stimulating the centers of emotion within a person's brain.  The device has settings allowing it to trigger fear, doubt, and hate, which he can induce for whatever duration and intensity he desires, from mild to extreme.  Though the limits of this device are unknown, he can induce a condition of fear capable of triggering hallucinations and even trigger death due to heart strain.

Psycho-Man also uses a number of suits of body armor made of alien materials allowing him to interact with Earth's universe.  These suits, which he controls cybernetically, can be altered to provide different specific offensive and defensive capabilities, including armor which is much larger than he himself is. Various suites of body armor have demonstrated sufficient strength to challenge the Thing in physical combat, augments his speed and stamina to superhuman levels.

Psycho-Man also employs a variety of advanced technological apparatus, including larger, non-portable emotion-inducing equipment with far greater range and effectiveness than his portable unit, enabling him to affect the emotional states of the entire populace of a planet. He also travels aboard a "world-ship" which also serves as a mobile laboratory and base of operations.

==Other versions==
=== Ultimate Psycho-Man ===
Psycho-Man appears in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #44 (Sept 2007). He is the ruler of [[Zenn-La]], and is called '''Revka Temerlune Edifex Scyros III''', "The king with no enemies". The [[Silver Surfer]] is his herald, having been trained as his successor. The name "Psycho-Man" is given to him by Johnny Storm.

Revka uses his mind control powers to make the people of Manhattan worship him, claiming he will bring peace to the world. He then takes them to Zenn-La, to "see what Heaven is like". He erases the memories of all the people and gives them the lives of dead Zenn-la dwellers. He was once ruled old Zenn-La and lost his sanity. After he trained Norrin Radd to be his successor Norrin broke Revka's control of people and Zenn-La destroyed itself. When the Fantastic Four regain their memories and powers he sends out a band of Silver Surfer-like assassins. In the battles aftermath, Psycho-Man lost control of the people and was "reprogrammed."{{issue}}

Revka possesses strong telepathic powers which are further augmented by surgical implants, which also grant him near immortality.
