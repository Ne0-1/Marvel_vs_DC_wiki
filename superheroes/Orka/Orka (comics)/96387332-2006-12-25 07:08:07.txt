'''Orka''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] turned anti-hero. 

==Fictional character history==

Orka was originally an Atlantean soldier in the army of [[Warlord Krang]], and aids Krang when he attempts to usurp the Atlantean throne from [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. When this attempt fails, Orka goes into exile with Krang. Orka is then chosen to be the test subject of Dr. Dorcas, the marine scientist who created [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], one of Namor's arch foes. Courtesy of a belt with a psionic amplifier, Orka is given the power of a killer whale, and aids Krang once more against Namor. Namor, however, defeats Orka who is buried in an undersea avalanche. <ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' Vol. 1, #23 - 24</ref> After another defeat at the hands of Namor, <ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' Vol. 1, #66 - 67 </ref> Orka accepts the offer of the Brand Corporation (a subsidiary of [[Roxxon Oil]]) who augment Orka's natural abilities and remove the need for the belt. Orka is then sent on a mission that brings him into conflict with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but is defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #149</ref>

Years later, Orka escapes imprisonment <ref>''Avengers'': Death Trap - The Vault (1991)</ref> and joins [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]], a team that also consisted of [[Attuma]], Nagala, Pirahna, Sea Urchin and [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]]. The group attacked the United States but were defeated by the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #319 - 324</ref>

Orka has also been in conflict with other superheroes such as the [[Fantastic Four]], <ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1, #336</ref> [[She-Hulk]] <ref> ''She-Hulk'' Vol. 2, #12</ref> and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. <ref>''Defenders'' Vol. 2, #7 + 11</ref> Orka recently joined [[Heroes For Hire]], and currently he works with the team to hunt supervillains.

==Powers and abilities==

Orka is a physical freak amongst Atlanteans, being 24 feet tall and easily the strongest of his race (Namor is a hybrid - half Atlantean and half human). Orka originally wore a belt provided by Dr. Dorcas that which by psionic means provided the added power of a killer whale to Orka's already considerable strength. The belt also allowed Orka to exist for indefinite periods although he was not at full strength due to dehydration. The Brand Corporation later augmented Orka's natural abilities, which allowed him to retain his strength without the use of the belt. The experimentation also increased Orka's endurance, but at the cost of his intelligence which was reduced. Orka can also communicate with and summon killer whales and can also swim at superhuman speeds.
