'''Orka''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] turned anti-hero that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Orka was originally an Atlantean soldier in the army of [[Warlord Krang]], and aids Krang when he attempts to usurp the Atlantean throne from [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. When this attempt fails, Orka goes into exile with Krang. Orka is then chosen to be the test subject of Dr. Dorcas, the marine scientist who created [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], one of Namor's arch foes. Courtesy of a belt with a psionic amplifier, Orka is given the power of a killer whale, and aids Krang once more against Namor. Namor, however, defeats Orka who is buried in an undersea avalanche. <ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' vol. 1, #23 - 24</ref> After another defeat at the hands of Namor, <ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' vol. 1, #66 - 67 </ref> Orka accepts the offer of the Brand Corporation (a subsidiary of [[Roxxon Oil]]) who augment Orka's natural abilities and remove the need for the belt. Orka is then sent on a mission that brings him into conflict with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but is defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #149</ref>

Years later, Orka escapes imprisonment <ref>''Avengers: Death Trap - The Vault'' (1991)</ref> and joins [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]], a team that also consists of [[Attuma]], Nagala, Pirahna, Sea Urchin and [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]]. The group attack the United States but are defeated by the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #319 - 324</ref>

Orka has also been in conflict with other superheroes such as the [[Fantastic Four]], <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #336</ref> [[She-Hulk]] <ref> ''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #12</ref> and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. <ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2, #7 + 11</ref> Orka then joins the team [[Heroes For Hire]], but is killed soon after in combat by a Doombot (a robotic copy of villain [[Doctor Doom]]) reprogrammed by the villains the [[Headmen]]. <ref>''Heroes For Hire'' v2. #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Orka is a physical freak amongst Atlanteans, being 24 feet tall and the strongest of his race, rivalling Namor in power. Orka originally wore a belt provided by Dr. Dorcas that which by psionic means provided the added power of a killer whale to Orka's already considerable strength. The belt also allowed Orka to exist for indefinite periods on land although he was not at full strength due to dehydration. The Brand Corporation later augmented Orka's natural abilities, which allowed him to retain his strength without the use of the belt. The experimentation also increased Orka's endurance, but at the cost of his intelligence, which was reduced. Orka can also communicate with and summon killer whales and can also swim at superhuman speeds. He has also shown the ability to add the strength of any whales in his vicinity to further enhance his own. Surrounded by several hundreds underwater, he was even able to engage the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in hand-to-hand-combat.<ref>''Defenders'' vol.2, #11</ref>
