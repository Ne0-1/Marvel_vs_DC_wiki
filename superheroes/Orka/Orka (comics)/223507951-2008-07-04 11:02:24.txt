'''Orka''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] turned anti-hero that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Orka was originally an Atlantean soldier in the army of [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]], and aids the renegade Krang when he attempts to usurp the Atlantean throne from [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. When this attempt fails, Orka goes into exile from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] with Krang. Orka is then chosen to be the test subject of [[Lemuel Dorcas|Dr. Dorcas]], the marine scientist who created [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], one of Namor's arch foes. Courtesy of a belt with a psionic amplifier, Orka is given the power of a killer whale, and aids Krang once more against Namor.<ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' vol. 1, #23</ref> Namor, however, defeats Orka as Orka battles Tiger Shark; Orka and Tigers Shark both fall down and undersea crevice and are buried in an undersea avalanche. <ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' vol. 1, #24</ref> Orka freed himself from the crevice, and allied himself with the other-dimensional Virago. He battled Namor and caused him to flee, but Namor returns and defeated Orka again. <ref>''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' vol. 1, #66 - 67 </ref> Orka is later summoned from the sea by the [[Serpent Crown]]. Orka accepts the offer of the Brand Corporation (a subsidiary of [[Roxxon Oil]]) which increases his size to 20 feet tall and augments Orka's natural abilities, removing the need for his belt. Orka is then sent on a mission that brings him into conflict with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Moondragon]], but Orka is defeated by Thor. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #149</ref>

Some time later, after [[Attuma]] had taken over Atlantis, Attuma pardoned Orka of his exile and Orka became a henchman to Attuma and a member of the Warlord Attuma's Imperial Army. Orka was employed by Attuma as part of an invasion force upon the surface world. Orka battled the Avengers and the [[Fantastic Four]], and was defeated by [[She-Hulk]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #18</ref>

Years later, Orka escapes imprisonment <ref>''Avengers: Death Trap - The Vault'' (1991)</ref> and joins [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]], a team that also consists of Attuma, Nagala, Piranha, Sea Urchin and Tiger Shark. The group attack the United States and battles the Avengers and the [[Supreme Soviets|People's Protectorate]]. Orka is overpowered by the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], then battles [[Perun (comics)|Perun]] and [[Box (comics)|Box]] and is overpowered; Deep Six are defeated by the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #319 - 324</ref>

Orka has also been in conflict with other superheroes such as the Fantastic Four, <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #336</ref> She-Hulk <ref> ''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #12</ref> and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. <ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2, #7 + 11</ref> Orka then joins the team [[Heroes For Hire]], but is killed soon after in combat by a Doombot (a robotic copy of villain [[Doctor Doom]]) reprogrammed by the villains the [[Headmen]]. <ref>''Heroes For Hire'' v2. #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Orka is a physical freak amongst Atlanteans, being 24 feet tall and the strongest of his race, rivalling Namor in power. Orka has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Orka originally wore a belt provided by Dr. Dorcas that which by psionic means provided the added power of a killer whale to Orka's already considerable strength. The belt also allowed Orka to exist for indefinite periods on land although he was not at full strength due to dehydration. Using surgical and electrochemical enhancements, the Brand Corporation later augmented Orka's natural abilities, which allowed him to retain his strength without the use of the belt. The experimentation also increased Orka's endurance, but at the cost of his intelligence, which was reduced. Orka can also communicate with and summon killer whales through high-pitched whistles and can also swim at superhuman speeds.

Orka has also shown the ability to add the strength of any whales in his vicinity to enhance his own. <ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2, #11</ref>

Orka has the ability to survive on either land or in water for indefinite periods. Like all members of ''Homo Mermanus'', Orka is subject to dehydration on land, and extended periods out of water will diminish his physical abilities. However, because of his artificial enhancements, Orka is able to remain on land for much greater periods of time than other members of his race.

Orka has received Atlantean army basic training.
