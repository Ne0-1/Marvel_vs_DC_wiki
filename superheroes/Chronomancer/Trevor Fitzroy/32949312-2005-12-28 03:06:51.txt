[[Image:Fitzroy.PNG|Trevor Fitzroy. Art by Georges Jeanty.|thumb]]'''Trevor Fitzroy''' is a comicbook supervillain in the [[X-Men]] series. He is primarily associated with the X-Man [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. Trevor Fitzroy first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #281. He was created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Whilce Portacio]]. 

A criminal from an apocalyptic future, Fitzory escaped to the present time. There, he became involved with a group known as the Upstarts, a group of people who killed for points. As part of this 'game', Fitzroy unleashed [[Sentinels]] and killed most of the [[Hellions]] and put their leader, [[Emma Frost]], into a coma.

A cop from Fitzroy's  future, Bishop, came to the present and went after Fitzroy, eventually killing the criminal. Bishop would remain in the present and join the X-Men.
