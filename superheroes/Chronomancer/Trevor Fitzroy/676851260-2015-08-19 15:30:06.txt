'''Trevor Fitzroy''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of the [[X-Men]], in particular [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. Created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Whilce Portacio]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #281 (October 1991).

Fitzroy hails from the same [[dystopia]]n future as Bishop. A mutant criminal, he possesses the ability to absorb energy from human beings and use that energy to open [[time travel|time portals]], which is how Bishop traveled to the present. He has since been featured as the main adversary in the series featuring Bishop.

==Fictional character biography==
===The future===
Trevor Fitzroy was the bastard son of Anthony Shaw, Black King of [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], in a dystopian future. Fitzroy joined the '''Academy for [[Xavier's Security Enforcers]]''' (XSE) and had a relationship with [[Shard (comics)|Shard]]. He turned out to be a criminal, though, and was removed from the Academy. His wealthy father tried to protect his son for a while, but when Fitzroy was caught for murder, even he could no longer protect him. Fitzroy was captured and arrested by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], Shard's brother and an XSE officer. 

Fitzroy himself thought that he was merely a teleporter, but a secret group of XSE agents, known as the '''Xavier's Underground Enforcers''' (XUE) discovered that Fitzroy had the ability to travel through time. The XUE recruited Shard and freed Fitzroy, hoping to use his powers to change the past to create a better present.  However, Shard, reminded how dangreous Fitzroy was, stopped them and Fitzroy was returned to prison.

===The Upstarts===
From prison, Fitzroy escaped to the present time with his mutant minion [[Bantam (comics)|Bantam]]. There, he became involved with a group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a competition set up by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] to eliminate her rivals within the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Led by the Gamesmaster, the Upstarts had to kill other mutants to receive points. The Upstart with the most points would win the prize: control over the Hellfire Club and the other competitors. To enter the competition, one had to kill a member of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle (though later members didn't have to.) 
As part of this “game,” Fitzroy unleashed [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] on the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] and their leader [[Donald Pierce]]. All were killed except Pierce, who escaped and arrived at the Hellfire Club, followed by the Sentinels. The Sentinels killed Pierce (later rebuilt) and then killed most of the [[Hellions]], put their leader, [[Emma Frost]], into a coma and apparently killed Jean Grey (who had actually switched her mind with Frost). The [[X-Men]], who had been negotiating with Frost, fought Fitzroy. Fitzroy was forced to open a large time portal, allowing prisoners from his own time to escape to the present. The prisoners attacked the X-Men, but stopped when three figures stepped through the portal: Bishop and fellow XSE agents Randall and Malcolm. They went after Fitzroy, eventually killing the escaped criminals. However, Malcolm and Randall were killed, and Bishop remained in the present, joining the X-Men.

Fitzroy turned on Selene and captured her, though she later managed to escape. He also brought in [[Siena Blaze]] to compete in the Upstart competition. Fitzroy clashed with the X-Men a second time when he tried to kill [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], but managed to escape again. When the Gamesmaster declared that the new target for the Upstart competition would be former members of the [[New Mutants]] and Hellions, Fitzroy attacked [[X-Force]], demanding they turn over [[Rictor]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. X-Force leader [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tricked Fitzroy into trying to absorb his life-energy, but as Cable's arm wasn't organic, Fitzroy's powers used his own life-energy to open a portal, seemingly killing him.

===After the Upstarts===
Fitzroy turns up later and joins the Hellfire Club, becoming the '''White Rook'''. During this time he cooperates with Pierce and Shaw, despite his previous attempts to kill them. He leaves the Club and travels back to an alternate future (Earth-9910), now calling himself the '''Chronomancer'''. He takes control over this new timeline, but Bishop arrives and fights Fitzroy, eventually killing him.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

===X-Factor===
A younger version appears that is a participant in the Summers Rebellion. Here, he is shown to be a good guy. After Cortex kills him during a fight, [[Layla Miller]] resurrects him physically but is unable to revive him with a soul, establishing the point at which he becomes a villain.<ref>X-Factor' vol.3 #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Fitzroy possessed the mutant ability to drain others of their life forces, converting it into energy and absorbing it into himself. With these energies, Fitzroy could create portals that could teleport those passing through them across time and space. He often was dependent on the mutant Bantam to direct and catalog the time-portals he made, lacking the ability to do so himself. 

In his early appearances, Fitzroy wears a futuristic battle-armor that increases his strength and protects him from opponents. This battle armor was destroyed by the X-Men and a second suit of armor was destroyed by X-Force.
Fitzroy also had several [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that obeyed his commands. These Sentinels were smaller than the 20th century type, but had the ability to repair themselves using material from their near vicinity.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Trevor Fitzroy & Bantam.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Trever Fitzroy and Bantam from [[X-Men Animated Series]]]]
Fitzroy was a guest-star in the two-part episode "One Man's Worth" of the episodes of the mid-’90s [[X-Men animated series|''X-Men'' animated series]]. Fitzroy, known as "the Mutant Traitor", under the orders of [[Master Mold]], travels back in time to 1959 to murder Charles Xavier. In the cartoon, he does not kill those whose energy he absorbs, but knocks them unconscious for a few days.

===Video Games===
Fitzroy was one of the bosses in ''[[X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy]]''.  Defeating him allows [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to be a playable character.
