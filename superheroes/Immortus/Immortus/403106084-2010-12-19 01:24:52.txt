{{For|the DC Comics character|General Immortus}}

'''Immortus''' ('''Nathaniel Richards''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is the future (and later, alternate) self of [[Kang the Conqueror]], and first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #10, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
At some point in his personal timeline, [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] became weary of battle, due to frustration and the loss of his son Marcus and consort Ravonna in several timelines.  He was approached by the alien Time-Keepers — time travelers from the end of the universe, the last living creatures in existence — to become their agent, preserving timelines rather than conquering them in exchange for immortality.  He accepted and reinvented himself again, this time as Immortus, the lord of the other-dimensional realm of [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)#Immortus' Limbo|Limbo]].

He again came into conflict with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but under different circumstances. In his first encounter with the Avengers as Immortus, he attempted the destruction of the Avengers through the use of mythological figures as combatants.<ref>''Avengers'' #10</ref> He was partially responsible for the creation of the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], allegedly creating a temporal copy of the [[original Human Torch]] that the android [[Ultron]] used to create the Vision. 

Later, he even allied with Kang the Conqueror in one of Kang's schemes against the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #131</ref> However, he was betrayed by Kang, and imprisoned while Kang utilized Immortus's advanced technology to create the first [[Legion of the Unliving]], made up of now-dead characters.<ref>''Avengers'' #132</ref> He was subsequently freed by the Avengers, and revealed to be the future persona of Pharaoh Rama-Tut and Kang the Conqueror. He offered to aid the Vision in learning his past.<ref>''Giant-Sized Avengers'' #3</ref>

Later, Immortus officiated at the double wedding of the Vision to the [[Scarlet Witch]], and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] to the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]].<ref>''Giant-Sized Avengers'' #4</ref> He next traveled to the Old West with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Moondragon]] in pursuit of Kang,<ref>''Avengers'' #141</ref> and assisted the Avengers in the defeat of Kang.<ref>''Avengers'' #143</ref> Some time later, he allied with the [[Space Phantom]] and [[Tempus (comics)|Tempus]], and removed the time travel enchantment from Thor's [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|uru hammer]].<ref>''Thor'' #281-282</ref>

Much later, he was revealed to have a long-term plot for the manipulation of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #48</ref> He deleted various time-line universes as part of this plan.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #53, 55, 59</ref> His plot to use the Scarlet Witch to become the "absolute master of time" was revealed, and he sent the third [[Legion of the Unliving]] to destroy the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #61</ref> However, he was rendered catatonic for a time by the Time-Keepers as punishment for his attempt to overthrow their rule.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #62</ref>  At this time, the original Human Torch was revealed not to be the progenitor of the Vision, though this discovery was later itself claimed to be a deception created by a Space Phantom.{{issue|date=December 2010}}  Manipulating beliefs regarding the relationship between the Torch and the Vision have been a priority for Immortus due to the Vision's connections to the Scarlet Witch, a 'nexus being' who may have been powerful enough to give birth to children who could threaten some of the most powerful cosmic entities in the universe; disrupting the Witch's relationship with the Vision limited the possibility that she would pass on her potential.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

Immortus was also responsible for manipulating [[Iron Man]] to turn against the Avengers by driving him insane,{{issue|date=December 2010}} which resulted in Iron Man's death until he was resurrected by [[Franklin Richards]] later.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

Immortus also came into conflict with his younger self, who was unable to see the reasoning behind Immortus' actions.{{issue|date=December 2010}}  Kang's conflict with Immortus was dubbed the "[[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]]".

Immortus faked his death several times before ultimately turning on the Time-Keepers to assist the Avengers and, as punishment, was truly killed.{{issue|date=December 2010}}  However, he was resurrected minutes later as temporal energies from the Time-Keepers' attempts to turn Kang directly into Immortus and thus fulfill the time loop caused a backlash that created Kang and Immortus as separate beings, freeing Kang from what he saw as a destiny as a "doddering old scholar."{{issue|date=December 2010}}

When the rash actions of Kang caused the timestream to become critically unbalanced, Immortus allied himself with the [[Next Avengers]] and future versions of Iron Man and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in an attempt to undo the damage. Disguising himself as a younger version of Kang, Immortus traveled back to the 21st century and convinced the Avengers to come to the future so that they could understand what had happened. Once the Avengers had successfully restored the timeline, Immortus turned on his allies and killed Iron Man and the Hulk before the youthful Avengers apparently killed him.<ref>''Avengers'' (Vol. 4) #1-6 (May-October 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Immortus has no superhuman powers, but he possesses a genius intellect, and has advanced and extensive knowledge of travel through and manipulation of time. It is known that he was tutored by the Time-Keepers.

Immortus also uses a wide variety of instrumentation for manipulation of and travel through time, most of which he designed.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
Immortus appears in [[Earth X]], as Pope of the Church of Immortus. The Church of Immortus' goals are to destroy Reed Richards' Human Torches, allowing mankind to keep their mutations. Upon completing this goal, the Church of Immortus would then leave the Earth to colonize the stars. Immortus is advised in his role by a mysterious man known as Mr. Church, who is Mephisto attempting to lead mankind into its own demise.

Initially, Immortus was able to travel into and out of Limbo at his own will, through use of a time machine. Mephisto would eventually use this to get past his inability to travel into Limbo directly, and would lock Immortus out of Limbo. Eventually, Immortus would be mutated into Kang by the Terrigen Mists, and destroys his time machine in a rage after Mephisto refers to him as Kang, cursing Mephisto for making him Kang again. In his final appearance in the series, he has come to grips with his being Kang, and vows to help Reed Richards undo the damage his Church of Immortus has caused.

==In other media==
===Television===
Immortus makes a brief appearance in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' Animated Series]] (1992) episode "Beyond Good and Evil part 4". At the conclusion of the story, the time-stream "custodian" Bender reveals (though only to the viewer) himself to be Immortus once [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] leaves.
