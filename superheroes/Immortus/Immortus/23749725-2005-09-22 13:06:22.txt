Immortus is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is the future self of '''[[Kang the Conqueror]]''', and first appeared in ''Avengers'' #10, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Character History==
At some point in his personal timeline, Kang became weary of battle, due to frustration and the loss of his son Marcus and consort Ravonna in several timelines.  He was approached by the alien '''Time-Keepers''' — time travelers from the end of the universe, the last living creatures in existence — to become their agent, preserving timelines rather than conquering them in exchange for immortality.  He accepted and reinvented himself again, this time as '''Immortus'''.  

He again came into conflict with the '''Avengers''', but under different circumstances. He was partially responsible for the creation of the '''[[Vision (comics)|Vision]]''', creating a temporal copy of the '''[[original Human Torch]]''' that the android '''[[Ultron]]''' used to create the Vision. He was also responsible for manipulating '''[[Iron Man]]''' to turn against the Avengers by driving him insane, which resulted in Iron Man's death until he was resurrected by '''[[Franklin Richards]]''' later. 

Immortus also came into conflict with his younger self, who was unable to see the reasoning behind Immortus' actions.  Kang's conflict with Immortus was dubbed the "'''[[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]]'''". 

Immortus faked his death several times before ultimately turning on the Time-Keepers to assist the Avengers and, as punishment, was truly killed.  However, he was resurrected minutes later as temporal energies from the Time-Keepers' attempts to turn Kang directly into Immortus and thus fulfill the time loop caused a backlash that created Kang and Immortus as separate beings, freeing Kang from what he saw as a destiny as a "doddering old scholar."
