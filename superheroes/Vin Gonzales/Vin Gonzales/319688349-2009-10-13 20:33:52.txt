'''Vin Gonzales''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supporting character]] of [[Spider-Man]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' main [[Shared universe|shared]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is the roommate of Peter Parker as well as Parker's first romantic rival since the [[retcon]]ing of his marriage to [[Mary Jane Watson]] in "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]."

==Fictional character biography==
Vin Gonzales is the roommate of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and an [[NYPD]] officer. When Peter was in search of roommate, Harry offered the idea of Vin, a friend of Lily and Carlie. He does not seem to trust [[Spider-Man]]. Vin seems to have a crush on [[Carlie Cooper]]. When the first rent arrives, Vin and Peter recently had an argument because of Peter's problems at the [[Daily Bugle]]. Vin thought that Peter still had his job as a photographer and Vin was giving Peter news tips. Peter decided not to tell Vin until he had found a job. Vin thought that Peter was playing him and that made Vin very angry.

Recently, Carlie Cooper found that a group of Spider-tracers were in the vicinity of Peter's and Vin's apartment. She goes over to investigate, only to discover a bag of spider-tracers under Vin's bed. Vin returns to get his key when Carlie reveals the bag and asks for explanation. Vin is unable to explain himself until his partner, Alan O'Neal, chastises him and slips that "we gave 'em to you to take care of" <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man #585''</ref>. Vin later admitted to Carlie that he and Al were involved in a secret conspiracy with other policemen to turn public opinion against Spider-Man in a smear campaign by planting tracers on people already dead to hopefully put an end to Spider-Mans' vigilante activities<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man #587''</ref>. A warrant is put on both him and Carlie. He is captured and taken to prison. At the prison, many criminals attack him for his status as a policeman, but Spider-Man rescues him and breaks him out of jail. Vin apologizes to Carlie, and proceeds to arrest the Sergeant. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref> His sister, Michelle Gonzales, who is an attorney, works out a plea deal for him, giving him six months in prison and a removal from the NYPD in exchange for the names of all the police involved. He agrees. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Extra'' #3</ref>

Later he got a phone call from his sister, Michelle, who revealed to her that she and Peter are dating and threatens to kill Peter when he leaves prison.

== Alternate Versions ==

In the [[MC2]] Universe, Vin appeared within the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #4. He is partner with Carlie at the time she gave Peter the inspiration to work with the police, which he currently does within the pages of [[Spider-Girl]].

==In other media==
Vin Gonzales, along with his partner, Alan O'Neal (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]) make unnamed appearances in the series ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. In "Natural Selection", Vin aims and shoots his gun at the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] when its terrorizing the subway. In "Probable Cause", he and O'Neal have a ride-along with [[Mary Jane Watson]] and [[Molten Man|Mark Allan]], with his partner joking about the students' attraction to each other.
