==Fictional character biography==
'''Albert Desmond''' suffered from [[multiple personality disorder]] where, like [[Two-Face]], one side was a harmless citizen, the other personality was a dark criminal. Utilizing his knowledge of chemistry, Desmond began his criminal debut under the guise of '''Mr. Element'''. After being sent to jail by Flash, Desmond somehow found the [[Philosopher's Stone]], which has the ability to transmute one element to another. After using the Stone to escape, Desmond restarted his criminal career under the new moniker of Doctor Alchemy and clashed with Flash many times, but was defeated every time.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Eventually, Desmond's good personality resurfaced and he quit crime and hid the Stone. However, a new Doctor Alchemy appeared, who turned out to be '''Alvin Desmond''', Albert's identical twin with whom he shares a psychic link. It was later revealed that the "twin" was a construct of Albert's evil by the Stone itself. The construct was eliminated, though Albert became Doctor Alchemy again and joined the rogues.  It was revealed that he had many lairs spread through the US, in a [[Gotham Central]] story arc a police officer was turned into beast after finding one of these labs.  He was transferred to Gotham City to assist in his transformation, but this was plot to escape.  He was swiftly beaten to pulp by [[Renee Montoya]] and sent back to Iron Heights where he was promptly broken out by the other rogues.

Desmond recently resurfaced, having gained the ability to transfer his essence into other people and possess them via the stone. In this way he tried to use [[Power Girl]] in a plot to kill [[Superman]].  [[Wonder Woman]] stopped him by throwing the Philosopher's Stone into the sun, only to find out later that Alchemy's essence was trapped inside. However, Superman pointed out that the stone has been destroyed many times in the past, and seems to always restore itself.

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Alchemy possesses the famed Philosopher's Stone. The stone allows him to transmute any element into any other element. He can control the Philosopherâ€™s Stone from a distance with telekinesis.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
Other characters have also utilized Desmond's gimmick:

* A [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] scientist named '''Dr. Curtis Engstrom '''briefly used the Philosopher's Stone as '''The Alchemist''' during the period Desmond was cured.
* More recently, '''Alexander Petrov''', a Central City police scientist, became the new Mr. Element. Although he used Desmond's original element-gun, and a variant of the costume, he attempted to confuse things by using the gun to freeze things, thereby implicating [[Captain Cold]]. He was killed by the real Captain Cold.

==Other media==
===Television===
* Doctor Alchemy and Mr. Element have appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]" as TWO background characters at the bar where Flash's enemies hang out.
