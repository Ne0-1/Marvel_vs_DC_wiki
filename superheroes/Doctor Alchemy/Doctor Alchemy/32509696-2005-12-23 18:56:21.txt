'''Doctor Alchemy''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and a [[Enemies of the Flash|rogue]] to the [[Flash (comics)|Flash II]] ([[Barry Allen]]). He first appeared in ''Showcase #13'' ([[April]] [[1958]]).

== History ==
'''Albert Desmond''' suffered from [[multiple personality disorder]] where, like [[Two-Face]], one side was a harmless citizen, the other personality was a dark criminal. Utilizing his knowledge of chemistry, Desmond began his criminal debut under the guise of '''Mr. Element'''. After being sent to jail by Flash, Desmond somehow finds the [[Philosopher's Stone]], which has the ability to transmute one element to another. Using the Stone to escape, Desmond restarts his criminal career under the new moniker of Doctor Alchemy and has clashed with Flash many times, but ultimately defeated each time. 

Eventually, Desmond's good personality resurfaced and he quit crime and hid the Stone. However, a new Doctor Alchemy appeared, who turned out to be '''Alvin Desmond''', Albert's identical twin whom he shares a psychic link with. It turns out that the "twin" was a construct of Albert's evil by the Stone itself. The construct was eliminated, though Albert became Doctor Alchemy again and joined the rogues.
