'''Flashback (Gardner Monroe)''' is a fictional [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Alpha Flight (1st series) #1''.
==Character history==
Flashback was once a member of [[Beta Flight]] who was then recruited by Jerry Jaxon into [[Omega Flight]], a team put together to gain revenge on [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]], [[Alpha Flight]].

During Alpha Flight's second encounter with Omega Flight, one of Flashback's duplicates was killed by [[Box (comics)|Box]] I after Delphine Courtney used it as a shield against the attack. It was not long after that time caught up with Flashback and he became the future self that was killed, resulting in his death.

==Powers==
He was a mutant with the psionic ability to cause temporal counterparts of himself from alternate future timelines to appear in the present and to control them. Each duplicate appeared in a reverse-colour version of the original Flashback's costume. These counterparts vanished whenever Flashback was rendered unconscious.
