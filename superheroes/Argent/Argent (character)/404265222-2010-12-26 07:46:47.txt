==Fictional character biography==
===Teen Titans===
'''Toni Monetti''' is the daughter of a former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[New Jersey]]. Around the time she turned sixteen, Toni's skin gains a silver sheen to it. At a pool party for her sixteenth birthday, Toni is mysteriously teleported away. Toni, along with a few other teens, learn that they are half-alien, and their mothers were impregnated by an alien race called the [[H'San Natall]] years ago. The teens are part of a [[sleeper agent]] program created by the H'San Natall to defeat the super-powered beings already on Earth. The group of teens stay together, and with the funding of [[Loren Jupiter]], became the newest incarnation of the [[Teen Titans]]. Toni’s ability to control bursts of silver plasma energy earns her the codename, Argent.

At first, Toni is not a very serious adventurer. However, after fellow teammate [[Isaiah Crockett (comics)|Joto]] apparently dies, Argent takes it particularly hard. She vows to become a better hero. It was then that Mr. Jupiter disbands the team, and Argent seeks training advice from [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. She accompanies him on a mission to stop drug runners, but when she found out her father was involved, she decides to keep the information secret.

When the Teen Titans reform, Argent was instrumental in initiating a membership drive. The team takes on new members Fringe and [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Captain Marvel Jr. (also known as CM3)]]. A possible romance of Argent with CM3 was explored, but after a particularly horrible date (CM3 was unable to cover the bill), it was abandoned.

After another battle with the H'San Natall, the team discovers that Joto was in fact alive. When members [[Prysm]] and Fringe decide to stay in space, and with CM3 having left earlier, the team decides to disband.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===The Titans===
When the original five Titans ([[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Donna Troy|Troia]], [[Wally West|Flash]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]]) decide to reform the Teen Titans in the wake of the Technis Imperative conflict (in which Toni had fought alongside the former Titans and the [[Justice League|JLA]]), Argent is invited to join.

Later, the Titans were involved in another case involving the highly addictive speed drug, [[List of comic book drugs#Velocity 9|Velocity 9]]. During the investigation, the role of Argent's father being a distributor of the drug came to light. Argent had to choose between her father and the Titans, and ultimately allows her father to be arrested.

Around this time, Argent is one of the first to fight against the [[Asmodel]]/[[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] entity in the "[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]" limited series. First, alongside Titans teammate [[Damage (comics)|Damage]], then with other superheroes, she helps fight a literal invasion from Hell in the streets of New York City. For her troubles, Spectre turns her eyes into squirming fly larvae. She, and other heroes affected, are restored by the efforts of the "[[Sentinels of Magic]]"

In the [[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|Graduation Day story arc]], a mysterious android from the future known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] attacks the Titans and [[Young Justice]], resulting in the apparent deaths of Troia and [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]]. After the funeral, Nightwing disbands the Titans.

When the Teen Titans are once again reformed by former members [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], and [[Beast Boy]], Argent is not invited. However, when this version of the Teen Titans fought against [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and all reserve members were called, she was present. She also joins the Titans in their battle against [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]], where she saves [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] by stopping the blood flowing from his shoulder after Superboy-Prime rips his arm off.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later]], Argent becomes one of the twenty members of the Teen Titans who quit after a few weeks. Her look was redesigned. During this time, she dates and later breaks up with teammate [[Molecule (comics)|Molecule]].

===Final Crisis===
In issue 3 of [[Final Crisis]], Argent is one of the superheroes drafted by Green Lantern [[Alan Scott]] under ''Article X''. Argent is seen fighting alongside other recruits in issue #5. She soon falls victim of the [[Darkseid|Dark Side Club]], and is forced to fight other captive metahumans at the behest of the [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] gods on Earth.<ref>''DC Column'' #136</ref> Argent is later rescued by [[Miss Martian]], who takes her and the other former prisoners to [[Titans Tower]] to rest. While there, Argent is offered a spot on the Teen Titans by [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], but declines.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #69</ref>

Following the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Argent is seen at the funeral for her former teammate and fellow Titan, [[Damage (comics)|Damage]].<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Argent can generate solid energy constructs out of silver [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], in simple forms such as protective shields, daggers, and battering rams. While she initially could not fly, she could create slides and flying platforms to carry herself and others through the air. Her silver plasma energy is said to be of a similar wavelength to the green plasma energies of a [[Green Lantern]]'s [[power ring (weapon)|ring]]. In ''JLA: Rock of Ages'', Argent's powers in the future had evolved to become almost identical to a Green Lantern's, as she was able to fly and could create more complex energy constructs, such as an entire army of silver plasma "superheroes".

==In other media==
Argent appeared in Season 5 of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series in the episode "Calling All Titans" in which she meets [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] and becomes an honorary Titan, but she is soon captured by [[General Immortus]] of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. Argent can fire crimson energy beams, and can use that energy to form objects similar to the abilities of the [[Green Lantern]].

The Argent in this series appears to be a [[New Zealand]]er rather than an [[United States|American]]. Argent has also been shown to have an interest in fashion when she asks Starfire: "''Does this come in black?''" when the yellow communicator clashes with her dark clothes. When [[Más y Menos]] unfreeze all of the captured Titans during the final battle of "Titans Together", Argent joins the fight. She is seen sending two energy beams in the form of hands after a fleeing [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Johnny Rancid|Johnny Rancid]]. Later, she is seen in [[Titans Tower]] and before the "battle" against [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]]. Argent is played by [[Hynden Walch]] who also voices Starfire.

Appears in:
* "Calling All Titans"
* "Titans Together" (cameo)

She has also appeared in the [[Teen Titans Go!]] comic (issues #34, #36, #39, and #41).
