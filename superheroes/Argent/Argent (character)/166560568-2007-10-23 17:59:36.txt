'''Argent''' is a [[DC Comics]] fictional [[superhero]]. She first appeared in the second series of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] comics in issue #1. She remained a regular member of that team for a long time, up until the events of ''Graduation Day'' when the Titans were disbanded by [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Teen Titans===
'''Toni Monetti''' was the daughter of a former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[New Jersey]]. Around the time she turned sixteen, Toni's skin gained a silver sheen to it. At a pool party for her sixteenth birthday, Toni was mysteriously teleported away. Toni, along with a few other teens, learned that they were half-alien, and their mothers were impregnated by an alien race called the H'San Natall years ago. The teens were part of a sleeper agent program created by the H'San Natall to defeat the super-powered beings already on Earth. The group of teens stayed together, and with the funding of Loren Jupiter, became the newest incarnation of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Toni’s ability to control bursts of silver plasma energy earned her the codename, Argent.

At first, Toni was not a very serious adventurer. However, after fellow teammate [[Hot Spot (comics)|Joto]] apparently died,  Argent took his death particularly hard and she vowed to become a better hero. It was then that Mr. Jupiter disbanded the team, and Argent sought training advice from [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. She accompanied him on a mission to stop drug runners, but when she found out her father was involved, she decided to keep the information secret.

When the Teen Titans reformed, Argent was instrumental in initiating a membership drive. The team took on new members [[Fringe (comics)|Fringe]] and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.|Captain Marvel Jr. (also known as CM3)]]. A possible romance of Argent with CM3 was explored, but after a particularly horrible date (CM3 was unable to cover the bill), it was abandoned.

After another battle with the H'San Natall, the team discovered that Joto was in fact alive. When members [[Prysm]] and Fringe decided to stay in space, and with CM3 having left earlier, the team decided to disband.

===The Titans===
When the original five Titans ([[Nightwing]], [[Donna Troy|Troia]], [[Wally West|Flash]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] decided to reform the Teen Titans in the wake of the Technis Imperative conflict (in which Toni had fought alongside the former Titans and the [[Justice League|JLA]]), Argent was invited to join.

Later, the Titans were involved in another case involving the highly addictive speed drug, Velocity 9. During the investigation, the role of Argent's father being a distributor of the drug came to light. Argent had to choose between her father and the Titans, and ultimately allowed her father to be arrested.

In the [[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|Graduation Day story arc]], a mysterious android from the future known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] attacked the Titans and [[Young Justice]], resulting in the apparent deaths of Troia and [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]]. After the funeral, Nightwing disbanded the Titans.

When the Teen Titans were once again reformed by former members [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], and [[Beast Boy]], Argent was not invited. However, when this version of the Teen Titans fought against [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] and all reserve members were called, she was present.  She also joined the Titans in their battle against [[Superboy-Prime]], where she saved [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] by stopping the blood flowing from his shoulder after Superboy-Prime ripped his arm off.

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later]], Argent became one of the 20 members of the Teen Titans who quit after a few weeks. Her look was re-designed. During this time she dated and later broke up with teammate, [[Molecule (comics)|Molecule]].

==Powers and abilities==
Argent can generate solid energy constructs out of silver [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], in simple forms such as protective shields, daggers, and battering rams. While she initially could not fly, she could create slides and flying platforms to carry herself and others through the air. Her silver plasma energy is said to be of a similar wavelength to the green plasma energies of a [[Green Lantern]]'s ring. In ''JLA: Rock of Ages'', Argent's powers in the future had evolved to become almost identical to a Green Lantern's, as she was able fly and could create more complex energy constructs, such as an entire army of silver plasma "superheroes".

==Argent in other media==
[[Image:Argent.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Argent in "Calling All Titans"]]

Argent appeared in Season 5 of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series in the episode "Calling All Titans" in which she meets [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] and becomes an honorary Titan, but she is soon captured by [[General Immortus]] of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. Argent can fire crimson energy beams, and can use that energy to form objects. Unlike the comic book version of the character, this version of Argent appears to hail from [[New Zealand]] (in the comics, she is Italian); the character speaks with a New Zealand [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]] and her clothes imply a gothic origin, and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] received her distress call from a small island similar in appearance to New Zealand. Argent has also been shown to have an interest in fashion when she asks Starfire: "''Does this come in black?''" when the yellow communicator clashes with her dark clothes.  When [[Más y Menos]] unfreeze all of the captured titans during the final battle of "Titans Together", Argent joins the fight. She is seen sending two energy beams in the form of hands after a fleeing [[Johnny Rancid]]. Later she is seen in the Titans Tower and before the "battle" against [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]]. Argent is played by [[Hynden Walch]] who also voices Starfire.

Appears in:
* "Calling All Titans"
* "Titans Together" (cameo)

She has also appeared in the [[Teen Titans Go!]] comic (issues #34, #36, #39, and #41).
