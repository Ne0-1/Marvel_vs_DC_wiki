'''Ant-Man''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Ant-Man was originally the superhero persona of [[Hank Pym]], a brilliant scientist who invented a substance that allowed him to change his size. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27.

After Pym retired his Ant-Man identity, successors [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]] have used Pym's technology to take on the role of Ant-Man.

==Film==
[[Edgar Wright]] plans to direct an [[action film]] for [[Marvel Studios]] with some humorous elements, insisting that ''Ant-Man'' will not be a comedy like ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' or a spoof.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Movies&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=270338&obj_id=28744 | title=Comic-Con 2006: ''Ant-Man'' Panel | publisher=IGN | date=2006-07-24 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref>  The script has been written by Wright and [[Joe Cornish (comedian)|Joe Cornish]], who plan to include [[Henry Pym]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] as major characters, with Pym as Ant-Man in the 1960s in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' style, and a [[flashforward]] to Lang as Ant-Man's successor in modern day.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4566 | title= Exclusive: Edgar Wright Talks ''Ant-Man'' | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2006-07-26 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref>

On February 9, 2007 Wright said that the project was in "a holding pattern" while the script was revised, with casting yet to begin.  The director reported that he would have news about the film in a few months.<ref>{{cite news | author=Steve Head | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/764/764950p1.html | title=Exclusive: Hot Fuzz Helmer Commences ''Them'' | publisher=IGN | date=2007-02-15 | accessdate=2007-04-06 }}</ref> He has been researching [[nanotechnology]] for the film.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070314_exclusive_interview_edgar_wrig.html | title=Exclusive Interview : Edgar Wright | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=2007-03-19 | accessdate=2007-04-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070317023203/http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070314_exclusive_interview_edgar_wrig.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-17}}</ref> As of March 2008, Wright told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine that a second draft of the script is being written. Known for being a comedy writer, the director noted that the film would not be overtly comedic, but that it would be "more of a full-on action adventure sci-fi film but with a comedic element."<ref>{{cite news | author=Glen Ferris | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=22141 | title=Exclusive: Edgar Wright Talks Ant Man | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=2008-03-10 | accessdate=2008-03-10 }}</ref>

On February 9, 2010 Stan Lee, the co-creator of Ant-Man, met with Wright for lunch, and Lee soon recounted the meeting on his Twitter feed: "To make up for my previous grievous error, here's a little item that may have escaped you. Marvel is prepping a movie starring-- Ant Man!" Lee continued in a further tweet, "I had lunch with the cool, young director Edgar Wright (''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'') and, as you'd imagine, we had fun discussing the tiny hero."<ref>{{cite web|last=Douglas |first=Edward |url=http://superherohype.com/news/avengersnews.php?id=9061 |title=Is Marvel Moving Forward with Ant-Man? |publisher=Superhero Hype |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

On February 11, 2010, Edgar Wright told [[MTV News]], "Because that character isn't one of their biggest properties, it’s not like a tentpole deadline. It’s more like me and Kevin Feige saying, 'Let's make a really good script.' We've always agreed on that — 'Let's make a good script that works, that’s all about a great genre film, and that isn’t necessarily relying on anything else.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/02/11/exclusive-edgar-wright-explains-his-ant-man-priorities |title=EXCLUSIVE: Edgar Wright Explains His 'Ant-Man' Priorities |publisher=Splashpage.mtv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

At the [[San Diego Comic Con]] in 2010, Wright confirmed that his script is an origin story, and that doesn't work for Marvel's chronology to include Ant-Man in ''[[Avengers (comics) in other media#Marvel Studios films|The Avengers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/MarvelFreshman/news/?a=20755 |title=Edgar Wright Says Ant-Man Won't Fit With The Avengers |publisher=Comicbookmovie.com |date=2010-07-27 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> Wright stated in January 2011 that he resumed writing the script for the film.<ref>http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/113684-edgar-wright-is-writing-ant-man-again</ref> During a Q and A at [[SXSW]] for Cornish's movie ''[[Attack the Block]]'', Wright and Cornish stated that they had been recently rewriting the script.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HWzpQMHRsQ</ref> While attending Kapow-Con in April 2011, Cornish revealed that Wright and he had delivered the second draft to the studio.<ref>http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/164831-ant-man-script-update</ref> Then on July 2011 Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish delivered a third draft and some concept art to Marvel Studios.<ref>[http://blogdesuperheroes.es/2011/09/28/cine-joe-cornish-espera-que-marvel-le-de-el-visto-bueno-al-guion-de-ant-man.html]</ref>

[[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that [[Henry Pym]] is referred to in the film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' as the friend that Dr. Selvig e-mails that had previous "experience" with SHIELD,  though his name was cut out of the scene.<ref>[http://collider.com/kevin-feige-intevrew-thor-avengers-iron-man-3-ant-man-doctor-strange-/88459/ Exclusive: Marvel’s Kevin Feige Talks THOR, AVENGERS, ANT-MAN, DOCTOR STRANGE, Animated Movies, Reveals What’s in Odin’s Vault]</ref>
