'''Ant-Man''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Ant-Man was originally the superhero persona of [[Henry Pym]], a brilliant scientist who invented a substance that allowed him to change his size. Henry Pym was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27. However, Henry Pym first appeared as the Ant-Man in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #35.

After Pym retired his Ant-Man identity, successors [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]] have used Pym's technology to take on the role of Ant-Man.

==Fictional character biography==

==Film==
[[Edgar Wright]] plans to direct an [[action film]] for [[Marvel Studios]] with some humorous elements, insisting that ''Ant-Man'' will not be a spoof.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Movies&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=270338&obj_id=28744 | title=Comic-Con 2006: ''Ant-Man'' Panel | publisher=IGN | date=2006-07-24 | accessdate=2006-07-30 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060809164956/http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Movies&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=270338&obj_id=28744| archivedate= 9 August 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The script has been written by Wright and [[Joe Cornish (comedian)|Joe Cornish]], who plan to include [[Henry Pym]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] as major characters, with Pym as Ant-Man in the 1960s in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' style, and a [[flashforward]] to Lang as Ant-Man's successor in modern day.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4566 | title= Exclusive: Edgar Wright Talks ''Ant-Man'' | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2006-07-26 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref> The film will take place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

On February 9, 2007 Wright said that the project was in "a holding pattern" while the script was revised, with casting yet to begin.  The director reported that he would have news about the film in a few months.<ref>{{cite news | author=Steve Head | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/764/764950p1.html | title=Exclusive: Hot Fuzz Helmer Commences ''Them'' | publisher=IGN | date=2007-02-15 | accessdate=2007-04-06 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070224224033/http://movies.ign.com/articles/764/764950p1.html| archivedate= 24 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He has been researching [[nanotechnology]] for the film.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070314_exclusive_interview_edgar_wrig.html | title=Exclusive Interview : Edgar Wright | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=2007-03-19 | accessdate=2007-04-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070317023203/http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070314_exclusive_interview_edgar_wrig.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-17}}</ref> As of March 2008, Wright told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine that a second draft of the script is being written.

On February 9, 2010 Stan Lee, the co-creator of Ant-Man, met with Wright for lunch, and Lee soon recounted the meeting on his Twitter feed: "To make up for my previous grievous error, here's a little item that may have escaped you. Marvel is prepping a movie starring-- Ant Man!" Lee continued in a further tweet, "I had lunch with the cool, young director Edgar Wright (''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'') and, as you'd imagine, we had fun discussing the tiny hero."<ref>{{cite web|last=Douglas |first=Edward |url=http://superherohype.com/news/avengersnews.php?id=9061 |title=Is Marvel Moving Forward with Ant-Man? |publisher=Superhero Hype |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

On February 11, 2010, Edgar Wright told [[MTV News]], "Because that character isn't one of their biggest properties, it’s not like a tentpole deadline. It’s more like me and Kevin Feige saying, 'Let's make a really good script.' We've always agreed on that — 'Let's make a good script that works, that’s all about a great genre film, and that isn’t necessarily relying on anything else.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/02/11/exclusive-edgar-wright-explains-his-ant-man-priorities |title=EXCLUSIVE: Edgar Wright Explains His 'Ant-Man' Priorities |publisher=Splashpage.mtv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100830090947/http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/02/11/exclusive-edgar-wright-explains-his-ant-man-priorities| archivedate= 30 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
