'''Ant-Man''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Ant-Man was originally the superhero persona of [[Henry Pym]], a brilliant scientist who invented a substance that allowed him to change his size. Henry Pym was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27; his first appearance in the Ant-Man persona was in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #35.

After Pym retired his Ant-Man identity, successors [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]] have used Pym's technology to take on the role of Ant-Man.
