'''Scott Lang''' was a thief who was refomed with the aid of Pym and [[Iron Man]]. After a career as the second Ant-Man, he became an affiliate of the [[Fantastic Four]] and most recently became a full-time member of the Avengers. For a period of time he dated [[Jessica Jones]]. He was killed in ''Avengers'' #500, but his daughter, Cassie, has taken up his heroic mantle as [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] in the pages of ''[[Young Avengers]]''.

===Eric O'Grady===
{{main|Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)}}

'''Eric O'Grady''' is the new "hero" to take up the title of Ant-Man. He is a low level [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] agent who happens to steal the new Ant-Man suit. He uses this new suit to help himself instead of helping mankind, such as asking for a date after saving a woman from a mugging, and considering paying muggers to rob women so he can come to their "rescue".

==Powers and abilities==
All three bearers of the Ant-Man sobriquet have had the ability to reduce their size though methods of activating the power varied, including exposure to a gas, taking a tablet, or mentally commanding their body to shrink. Henry Pym designed and wore a helmet which gave him the ability to communicate with ants through cybernetic interfaces that are built into the helmet. These interfaces have also been built into larger devices, and utilized by Lang and O'Grady.
