'''Ant-Man''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The first Ant-Man, [[Henry Pym]], was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appears in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #35. Since Pym, both [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]] have used the name Ant-Man.

==Fictional character biography==
Over the years a variety of characters have assumed the title of Ant-Man, most of whom have been connected with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

===Henry Pym===
{{main|Henry Pym}}
'''Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym''' invented the various methods for someone to reduce their size and assume the identity of Ant-Man, armed with a helmet that can control ants.

Over the years he has adopted other aliases, largely based on his size altering discovery: Pym Particles. These include [[Giant-Man]], [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]], [[Yellowjacket (comics)|Yellowjacket]], and currently Wasp

===Scott Lang===
{{main|Ant-Man (Scott Lang)}}
'''Scott Lang''' was a thief who was reformed with the aid of Pym and [[Iron Man]]. After a career as the second Ant-Man, he became an affiliate of the [[Fantastic Four]], and most recently became a full-time member of the Avengers. For a period of time he dated [[Jessica Jones]]. He was killed in ''Avengers'' #500, but his daughter, Cassie, has taken up his heroic mantle as [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], in the pages of ''[[Young Avengers]]''.

===Eric O'Grady===
{{main|Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)}}
'''Eric O'Grady''' is the third character to take up the title of Ant-Man. Eric O'Grady is a low-level agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who stumbled upon who he believed was Dr.Henry Pym, but actually a Skrull impostor, in the latest incarnation of the Ant-Man suit, in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters. A man of very few morals and willing to lie, cheat, steal, and manipulate in order to get ahead in life, Eric  really immediately stole the armor for his own selfish plans, which included using his status as a "super-hero" to seduce women, and humiliate and torment others. He had his own short-lived title before being shuttled off, first to the pages of "Avengers: The Initiative," and then, "The Thunderbolts".

==Film adaptation==
[[Edgar Wright]] plans to direct an [[action film]] with some humorous elements, insisting that ''Ant-Man'' will not be a comedy like ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' or a spoof.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Movies&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=270338&obj_id=28744 | title=Comic-Con 2006: ''Ant-Man'' Panel | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2006-07-24 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref>  The script has been written by Wright and [[Joe Cornish (comedian)|Joe Cornish]], who plan to include [[Henry Pym]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] as major characters, with Pym as Ant-Man in the 1960s in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' style, and a [[flashforward]] to Lang as Ant-Man's successor in the 1980s/1990s.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4566 | title= Exclusive: Edgar Wright Talks ''Ant-Man'' | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2006-07-26 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref>

On February 9, Wright said that the project was in "a holding pattern" while the script was revised, with casting yet to begin.  The director reported that he would have news about the film in a few months.<ref>{{cite news | author=Steve Head | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/764/764950p1.html | title=Exclusive: Hot Fuzz Helmer Commences ''Them'' | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2007-02-15 | accessdate=2007-04-06 }}</ref> He has been researching [[nanotechnology]] for the film.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070314_exclusive_interview_edgar_wrig.html | title=Exclusive Interview : Edgar Wright | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=2007-03-19 | accessdate=2007-04-06 }}</ref> As of March 2008, Wright told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine that a second draft of the script is being written. Known for being a comedy writer, the director noted that the film would not be overtly comedic, but that it would be "more of a full-on action adventure sci-fi film but with a comedic element."<ref>{{cite news | author=Glen Ferris | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=22141 | title=Exclusive: Edgar Wright Talks Ant Man | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=2008-03-10 | accessdate=2008-03-10 }}</ref>
