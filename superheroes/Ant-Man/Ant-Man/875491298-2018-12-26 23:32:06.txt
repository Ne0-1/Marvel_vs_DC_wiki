'''Ant-Man''' is the name of several [[fictional]] [[superhero]]es appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Ant-Man's first appearance was in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #35 (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist [[Hank Pym]]'s superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size, but [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Eric O'Grady]] also took on the mantle after the original changed his superhero identity to [[Giant-Man|various]] [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|other]] [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|aliases]].

==Fictional character biography==
Over the years a number of different characters have assumed the title of Ant-Man, most of whom have been connected with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

===Hank Pym===
{{main|Hank Pym}}
The original Ant-Man was Biophysicist and Security Operations Center expert Dr. Henry 'Hank' Pym; who decided to become a superhero after the death of his first wife '''Maria Trovaya''', who had been a political dissident in Hungary. Falling in love with him and believing that his American citizenship would protect her, Hank and Maria traveled to Hungary shortly after their marriage to start their new life together. Unfortunately they were confronted by corrupt agents of the secret police. Hank was knocked unconscious and Maria was murdered. Pym was greatly distraught by his wife's death, and decided to do whatever he could in the future to battle injustice. After discovering a chemical substance, which he called Pym Particles, that would allow the user to alter his size, he armed himself with a helmet that could control ants. After that, Pym would shrink down to the size of an insect to become the mystery-solving Ant-Man, solving crimes and stopping criminals.<ref name="IGN Hank Bio">{{cite web | url = http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924202_biography.html | title = Henry Pym Biography | accessdate = April 18, 2011 | work = IGN | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130126003441/http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924202_biography.html | archive-date = January 26, 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}</ref> He soon shared his discovery with his new girlfriend [[Janet van Dyne]], who became his crime-fighting partner the Wasp, when he helped her avenge the death of her scientist father Vernon van Dyne who was killed by an alien unleashed by one of Vernon's own experiments.<ref name='invasionillumination'>{{cite web | url = http://marvel.com/news/story/3725/secret_invasion_illumination_hank_pym | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130128062751/http://marvel.com/news/story/3725/secret_invasion_illumination_hank_pym | dead-url = yes | archive-date = January 28, 2013 | title = Secret Invasion Illumination | accessdate = April 18, 2011 | date = May 30, 2008 | work = Marvel.com }}</ref> The duo would become founding members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], fighting recurring enemies such as the mad scientist [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], the mutant [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], and Pym's own robotic creation [[Ultron]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://marvel.com/news/story/6469/psych_ward_hank_pym | title = Psych Ward: Hank Pym | accessdate = April 18, 2011 | date = December 29, 2008 | work = Marvel.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110423110120/http://marvel.com/news/story/6469/psych_ward_hank_pym | archive-date = April 23, 2011 | dead-url = no | df = mdy-all }}</ref> While Pym is the original Ant-Man, he has adopted other aliases over the years including [[Giant-Man]], [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]], [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]],<ref name='invasionillumination'/> and Wasp after Janet's presumed death in ''[[Secret Invasion]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://marvel.com/news/story/9634/mighty_avengers_assemble | title = Mighty Avengers: Assemble | accessdate = April 18, 2011 | date = October 7, 2009 | work = Marvel.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021052035/http://marvel.com/news/story/9634/mighty_avengers_assemble | archive-date = October 21, 2012 | dead-url = no | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Leaving his original persona vacant, his successors have taken up the Ant-Man role while Pym explored these other identities.
