'''Ant-Man''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The first Ant-Man, [[Hank Pym]], was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appears in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #35. Since Pym, both [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]] have used the name Ant-Man.

==Fictional character biography==
Over the years a variety of characters have assumed the title of Ant-Man, most of whom have been connected with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

===Hank Pym===
{{main|Henry Pym}}
After discovering a size-altering chemical substance, biophysicist and nanotechnology expert '''Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym''' decided to become a superhero. Armed with a helmet that could control ants, Pym would shrink down to the size of an insect to become the unconventionally heroic '''Ant-Man'''. He soon shared his discovery with his girlfriend, [[Janet Van Dyne]], who became his crime-fighting partner as '''the Wasp'''. The duo would become founding members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and found recurring enemies in the villainous [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]] and Pym's own robotic creation, [[Ultron]].

Pym has adopted other aliases over the years, largely based around the properties of his size-altering "Pym Particles". These include [[Giant-Man]], [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]], [[Yellowjacket (comics)|Yellowjacket]], and the Wasp.

===Scott Lang===
{{main|Ant-Man (Scott Lang)}}
'''Scott Lang''' was a thief who was reformed with the aid of Pym and [[Iron Man]]. After a career as the second Ant-Man, he became an affiliate of the [[Fantastic Four]], and most recently became a full-time member of the Avengers. For a period of time he dated [[Jessica Jones]]. He was killed in ''Avengers'' #500, but his daughter, Cassie, has taken up his heroic mantle as [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], in the pages of ''[[Young Avengers]]''.

===Eric O'Grady===
{{main|Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)}}
'''Eric O'Grady''' is the third character to take up the title of Ant-Man. Eric O'Grady is a low-level agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who stumbled upon who he believed was Dr. Henry Pym but actually a Skrull impostor in the latest incarnation of the Ant-Man suit in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters. A man of few morals and willing to lie, cheat, steal, and manipulate in order to get ahead in life, Eric stole the armor for his own selfish plans, which included using his status as a "super-hero" to seduce women, and humiliate and torment others. He had his own short-lived title before being shuttled off, first to the pages of ''Avengers: The Initiative'' and then ''The Thunderbolts'' and most currently ''Secret Avengers''.

==Film==
[[Edgar Wright]] plans to direct an [[action film]] for [[Marvel Studios]] with some humorous elements, insisting that ''Ant-Man'' will not be a comedy like ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' or a spoof.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Movies&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=270338&obj_id=28744 | title=Comic-Con 2006: ''Ant-Man'' Panel | publisher=IGN | date=2006-07-24 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref>  The script has been written by Wright and [[Joe Cornish (comedian)|Joe Cornish]], who plan to include [[Henry Pym]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] as major characters, with Pym as Ant-Man in the 1960s in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' style, and a [[flashforward]] to Lang as Ant-Man's successor in the 1980s/1990s.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4566 | title= Exclusive: Edgar Wright Talks ''Ant-Man'' | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2006-07-26 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref>

On February 9, 2007 Wright said that the project was in "a holding pattern" while the script was revised, with casting yet to begin.  The director reported that he would have news about the film in a few months.<ref>{{cite news | author=Steve Head | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/764/764950p1.html | title=Exclusive: Hot Fuzz Helmer Commences ''Them'' | publisher=IGN | date=2007-02-15 | accessdate=2007-04-06 }}</ref> He has been researching [[nanotechnology]] for the film.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070314_exclusive_interview_edgar_wrig.html | title=Exclusive Interview : Edgar Wright | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=2007-03-19 | accessdate=2007-04-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070317023203/http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070314_exclusive_interview_edgar_wrig.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-17}}</ref> As of March 2008, Wright told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine that a second draft of the script is being written. Known for being a comedy writer, the director noted that the film would not be overtly comedic, but that it would be "more of a full-on action adventure sci-fi film but with a comedic element."<ref>{{cite news | author=Glen Ferris | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=22141 | title=Exclusive: Edgar Wright Talks Ant Man | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=2008-03-10 | accessdate=2008-03-10 }}</ref> On February 9, 2010 Stan Lee, the co-creator of Ant-Man, met with Wright for lunch, and Lee recapped on his Twitter feed with two tweets: (1) "To make up for my previous grievous error, here's a little item that may have escaped you. Marvel is prepping a movie starring-- Ant Man!" and (2) "I had lunch with the cool, young director Edgar Wright (''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'') and, as you'd imagine, we had fun discussing the tiny hero."<ref>{{cite web|last=Douglas |first=Edward |url=http://superherohype.com/news/avengersnews.php?id=9061 |title=Is Marvel Moving Forward with Ant-Man? |publisher=Superhero Hype |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

On February 11, 2010, Edgar Wright told [[MTV News]], "Because that character isn't one of their biggest properties, it’s not like a tentpole deadline. It’s more like me and Kevin Feige saying, 'Let's make a really good script.' We've always agreed on that — 'Lets make a good script that works, that’s all about a great genre film, and that isn’t necessarily relying on anything else.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/02/11/exclusive-edgar-wright-explains-his-ant-man-priorities |title=EXCLUSIVE: Edgar Wright Explains His 'Ant-Man' Priorities |publisher=Splashpage.mtv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

It was rumored that [[Nathan Fillion]] and [[Eva Longoria]] were up for the roles of Ant-Man and Wasp. At the [[San Diego Comic Con]] in 2010, Wright confirmed that his script is an origin story, and that doesn't work for Marvel's chronology to include Ant-Man in ''[[Avengers (comics) in other media#Marvel Studios films|The Avengers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/MarvelFreshman/news/?a=20755 |title=Edgar Wright Says Ant-Man Won't Fit With The Avengers |publisher=Comicbookmovie.com |date=2010-07-27 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>
It is very likely that [[Edgar Wright]] and [[Big Talk Productions]] will be co-distributing it with [[Walt Disney Pictures]].
