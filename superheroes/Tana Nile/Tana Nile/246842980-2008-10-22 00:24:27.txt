'''Tana Nile''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==

Tana Nile was a leading female member of the Colonizers of [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigel]]. Opposed by  [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] when she first attempted to colonize the planet Earth, she later became a frequent ally. Her name is evocative of ancient Egypt: tana leaves were the fictional herbs used in mummy wrappings in various Universal Studio horror films, and the Nile is the major river in Egypt.

Tana Nile plays a major role in finding a new home-world for the Rigellians after the destruction of their native world<ref>Thor #218</ref>, Rigel-3, by the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#R|Rhunians]].

Tana visited [[Charles Xavier]]'s [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] to learn more about human beings.  During an adventure in an alternate dimension created by [[Franklin Richards]], she fell in love with [[Howard the Duck]].  After a spontaneous kiss, Howard tells her of his attachment to Beverly Switzler, and she accepts that romance with him is inappropriate. <ref>''Generation X'' #23, 25; ''Daydreamers'' 1-3</ref>

She frames [[Ronan the Accuser]] for the House of Fiyero in exchange for information on Ronan. He promises to hunt her down, along with others involved in the trial, to discover the true reason behind his dismissal. 

She later joined [[Gamora]]'s Graces, a collection of super-powered women from across the galaxy. The Graces, along with much of known space, comes under threat by the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]]. Tana does not survive.
