The '''In-Betweener''' is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[character]] created by [[Jim Starlin]]. The character is a cosmic entity and in addition to being an incarnation of balance and duality is the metaphysical counterpart of [[Galactus]]. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18</ref> 

==Fictional character biography==
By the In-Betweener's own admission, "he" represents the dualities of concepts such as good and evil; logic and emotion; reality and illusion and life and death. <ref>''Warlock'' #10 (1975)</ref> The In-Betweener is also an agent of the concepts [[Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]], although his loyalty is often to himself rather than to them. <ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1 (1990)</ref>

The In-Betweener's appearances in the Marvel Universe have been sporadic. The hero [[Adam Warlock]] is the first terran meta-human to encounter the In-Betweener, and the entity reveals that it is destined to force Warlock to transform into his villainous future self the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]]. Warlock, however, was able to escape this fate with help from the Titan [[Thanos]]. <ref>''Warlock'' #10 (1975)</ref> The In-Betweener later appears and has a confrontation with the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and compels Death to slay three of the entities the [[Elders of the Universe]]. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #17</ref> Soon after this the In-Betweener also battles Galactus and his robotic servant the [[Punisher (robot)|Punisher]].<ref name="Galactus Battle">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18</ref>

After an encounter with the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]], the In-Betweener is imprisoned as punishment for rebelling against his masters. <ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #26-28</ref> He is later freed by Thanos, who secretly desires the Soul Gem the In-Betweener wears, as it is one of the six [[Infinity Gems]]. Thanos then steals the gem and abandons the In-Betweener to face the wrath of his masters when they realize he has escaped his prison.<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1 (1990)</ref>

The In-Betweener most recently appeared as a pawn of the villain [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], who is a member of the criminal organisation [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Scorpio, however, was stopped by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the In-Betweener was subsequently freed. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #58-60</ref>

The In-Betweener also appeared in a story set in the alternate dimension of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#Confirmed Designated Earths and Alternate Planes of Existence|Earth-957]]. <ref>''What If?'' vol. 2, #75</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the physical embodiment of the cosmic balance between Chaos and Order, the In-Betweener is able to manipulate cosmic energy to alter reality to achieve nearly any effect, ability or power desired, and possesses power on a scale with [[Galactus]].<ref name="Galactus Battle">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18</ref> He is, however, as a servant of Lord Chaos and Master Order, under their absolute control. The In-Betweener's other major (and unique) ability is to analyze a target and then direct energy in a "polar opposite" form at the target, which is instantly fatal.
