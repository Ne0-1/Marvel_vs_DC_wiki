'''In-Betweener''' is a fictional cosmic being character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a living incarnation of balance and duality..  In him exist the dualities of life and death, reality and illusion, good and evil, logic and emotion, existence and nothingness, god and man. He is an agent of [[Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]], though his loyalties towards his masters is often flexible depending on the situation.

[[Adam Warlock]] first encountered the In-Betweener, with it revealed to Warlock that the In-Betweener was destined to force Warlock to transform into his villainous future self "The Magus". Warlock was able to escape this fate with help from Thanos.

After several encounters with [[Doctor Strange]], In-Betweener was imprisoned along with one of the [[Infinity Gems]] he had acquired for trying to rebel against his masters. Thanos helped the In-Betweener escape his prison after proposing an alliance to destory Lord Chaos and Master Order, but abandoned the In-Betweener to the wrath of his masters when they realized that he broken free of his prison.

Most recently, the In-Betweener appeared in the pages of the Avengers during the arc "World Trust". He was kidnapped and split into his respective order and chaos halves by the newest incarnation of "Scorpio", who used the power gained via splitting the two halves up to teleport the world capitals to the other-dimensional realm of the Zodiac Key. In the end, the Avengers restored the two halves of the In-Betweener to their combined form and defeated Scorpio. Before he left the Avengers, In-Betweener cryptically warned the Avengers that one of their members (revealed to be Jack of Hearts) would die soon. 

The In-Betweener also played a significant role in [[What If (comics)|''What If?'' vol. 2 #75]], where he took on [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#Confirmed Designated Earths and Alternate Planes of Existence|Earth-957]] as his apprentice after she inadvertently gained powers like his own.
