'''Intergang''' is a fictional [[organized crime]] organization in ''[[Superman]]'' and other [[DC Comics|DC]] comics.  Armed with technology supplied by the villainous [[New Gods]] of the planet [[Apokolips]], it is a potent foe who can seriously challenge the most powerful [[superhero]]es. It was created by [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #133 (October 1970).

==Fictional history==
Intergang was run by a gangster named [[Bruno Mannheim]], as revealed in ''Jimmy Olsen'' #139. He was, however, getting orders and weaponry from [[Darkseid]], who was using Intergang to help track down the [[Anti-Life Equation]].

Intergang also worked with [[Morgan Edge]], the head of the Galaxy Broadcasting System [[television]] network (which had recently purchased the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and had Clark Kent transferred to its Metropolis affiliate WGBS-TV as its [[anchorman]]).  It was later revealed that this was not the real Morgan Edge, but a [[cloning|clone]] from the "Evil Factory." When the clone could not bring itself to kill the original Edge at the order of Darkseid the real Edge was imprisoned. The original Edge would later escape with the help of Jimmy Olsen. During an ensuing battle with Intergang the clone was mistaken for the original by Intergang hitman Tombstone Gear and incinerated. The real Edge was soon free to resume his role as Galaxy's president.

===Post ''Crisis''===

In the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[DC Universe]], Edge was the leader of Intergang, until he suffered a heart attack due to stress. While he believed he was working for Darkseid, his Apokoliptian contact was actually [[Desaad]], whose only aim in supplying him with weaponry was to cause suffering.  While he was in the hospital his legitimate businesses were taken over by his father, Vincent Edge, and Intergang was taken over by Ugly Mannheim, who trained on Apokolips with [[Granny Goodness]] (a later [[retcon]] has it that Mannheim was the original leader of Intergang, dealing knowingly with Desaad.  How Edge took over is unrevealed.)

Eventually, Intergang was brought down by Clark Kent and [[Cat Grant]], Mannheim was arrested, but managed to escape. He attempted to disappear through a "[[boom tube]]" (a New Gods transporter), but it collapsed when he was halfway through.

Some time later, Mannheim's father, [[Moxie "Boss" Mannheim]], a gangster who had been in prison since the 1940s after being captured by the [[Newsboy Legion]], was released. Discovering that the Newsboys were, seemingly, the same age as when he first fought them, he determined to find out how such a thing could be. Meeting renegade [[Project Cadmus]] geneticist [[Dabney Donovan]], he arranged for himself and his former gang members from the 1940s to be cloned into youthful bodies with superpowers. Using Vincent Edge to arrange a meeting between Metropolis' gang-leaders, he killed them all, and declared himself the new head of Intergang. The new Intergang spent much of their time tracking down [[Jimmy Olsen]], whom Moxie believed knew Superman's [[secret identity]].

Following a short-lived attempt by Morgan Edge to regain control, [[Lex Luthor]] gained control of Intergang, retaining Moxie as a figurehead. Moxie and his lieutenants were later captured by Superman. When last seen, Intergang was run by a criminal cyberneticist named Frank Sixty.

===Infinite Crisis===
There was some suggestion that Boss Moxie (who was a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time) was slain during the [[miniseries]] ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. The suggestion come from a sequence during [[Battle of Metropolis]], during which [[Superboy-Prime]] snaps a villain's neck, killing him.

===52===
In week 9 of the ongoing 2006 weekly series, ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', [[Question (comics)|the Question]] tells [[Renee Montoya]] that Intergang is preparing for an invasion of [[Gotham City]]. Two weeks later, the pair finally have a confrontation with the two operatives of Intergang in Gotham, [[Whisper A'Daire]] and [[Kyle Abbot]], known in the public eye as the manager of ''HSC International Banking'', an holding connected to Intergang itself, and her [[bodyguard]]. In the weeks that follow, the further investigations of Montoya and the Question reveal Intergang to be operating a mining company called Ridge Ferrick in regions such as [[Australia]], and also having expanded into nations such as [[Oolong Island]], [[Bialya]] and [[Yemen]], reorganized along quasi-religious lines, complete with a "holy" text known variously as the Book of Crime or the [[Crime Bible]], which treats [[Cain and Abel (comics)|Cain]] as a heroic, if not semi-divine, figure for his role according to Judeo-Christian theology in creating the "most sacred" crime of murder.  It has even been revealed that the original text is bound by the stone with which Cain slew Abel. In issue #25, Bruno Mannheim was revealed as the current head of Intergang, which is also behind the kidnapping of many of the world's "mad scientists", in a grand plan to take over America by the end of the year. He shows himself now acting like a cult leader, exalting the power of crime as the dominant order in the 21st century, and now becoming a cannibal, eating anyone he kills who refuses to join Intergang.

In ''Superman #654'', Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim returns as a giant wielding alien technology, claiming that someone other than Darkseid is behind Intergang's current activities.

===Gotham Underground===
In the storyline ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Intergang is in a gang war with [[Tobias Whale]]. Intergang buys him out and makes Tobias Whale the CEO of Kord Enterprises which has become a front for Intergang's criminal activities.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Intergang appeared in several episodes of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. Some names were changed, Vincent and Morgan Edge became Bill Church, Sr., and Bill Church, Jr., Galaxy Broadcasting became Multiworld Communications, etc. No mention was made of Apokolips. The Churches were played by [[Peter Boyle]] and [[Bruce Campbell]] respectively. By the end of the series, both Churches were in prison and Intergang was being run by Bill Church, Sr.'s young wife, Mindy ([[Jessica Collins (I)|Jessica Collins]]), who appeared to be an airhead, but was actually a ruthless mastermind. Mindy and Bill worked together to frame Bill Church, Sr. after going straight, but Mindy double crossed Bill, Jr. and both Bill Churches went to jail. In a Christmas episode, Mindy worked with another person to poison Superman with a Krypton disease. Superman was later cured. Mindy got her accomplice arrested, by making the authorities think that her office was his office.

* In ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', Morgan Edge was portrayed as living on an island with his own personal army and then is frozen by [[Killer Frost]] as the [[Secret Society of Supervillains|Secret Society]] ([[Gorilla Grodd]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], [[Sinestro]], [[Giganta]], [[Shade (comics)|The Shade]] and Frost) freed [[Clayface]], who was being held by Edge.

* Intergang received a brief mention in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "This Little Piggy." During a [[stakeout]], an impatient [[Wonder Woman]] asked [[Batman]] what the criminal organization would want with the [[Rosetta Stone]]. Batman replied with the remark, "Intergang moves in mysterious ways."

* Morgan Edge has appeared as a Metropolis gang boss in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', initially played by [[Rutger Hauer]], and later by [[Patrick Bergin]]. In a deleted scene he mentions his affiliation to Intergang. Bruno Mannheim made an appearance in the episode "Stiletto". Lois inadvertently created a superhero alter-ego called "Stiletto"--in reference to a pair of [[stiletto]] high heels she happened to be wearing on the way to a formal eventâ€”when she kicked a [[purse snatcher]] in the face. Mannheim, a low-eschelon but ambitious and greedy hood, is taken to task for engaging in petty street robberies. He responds by gunning down his boss and grabs control of his club and all his rackets. He plans to use Stiletto to bring [[The Red and Blue Blur]][[Clark Kent (Smallville)|(Clark)]] out of hiding. He was played by [[Dominic Zamprogna]]. At one point one of his cronies calls him "Ugly", his nickname in the comics.

* In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Intergang was run by Bruno Mannheim (voiced by [[Bruce Weitz]], who coincidentally played the Church Sr.'s lawyer on Lois & Clark). Mannheim was often the target of the [[Toyman]], a villain who used incredibleâ€”and lethalâ€”toys to get revenge on him for framing the Toyman's father for embezzlement. Darkseid supplied Mannheim with Apokoliptian technology to further his own agenda, using his personal assassin [[Kanto]] as an intermediary. Mannheim was later killed in the explosion of a nuclear power plant when helping Darkseid. In a later episode, Intergang was reorganized under the leadership of Granny Goodness.
