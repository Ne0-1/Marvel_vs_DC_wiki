'''Intergang''' is a fictional [[organised crime]] organisation in ''[[Superman]]'' comics. It was created by [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''Superman's Pal [[Jimmy Olsen]]'' #133 (October 1970). 

In its initial appearance Intergang was run by Boss Moxie, a gangster Kirby had originally created in his ''[[Newsboy Legion]]'' stories. He was, however getting orders and weaponry from [[Darkseid]], who was using Intergang to help track down the [[Anti-Life Equation]].

Intergang later worked with Morgan Edge, the head of Galaxy Broadcasting and the WGBS network that [[Clark Kent]] worked for. It was later revealed that this was not the real Morgan Edge, but a [[clone]] from the [[Evil Factory]].

In the Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[DC Universe]], Edge was the leader of Intergang, until he suffered a heart attack due to stress. While he believed he was working for Darkseid, his [[Apokolips|Apokoliptian]] contact was actually [[Desaad]], whose only aim in suppliying him with weaponry was to cause suffering. While he was in hospital his legitimate businesses were taken over by his father, Vinnie Edge, and Intergang was taken over by "Ugly" Mannheim, Boss Moxie's son, who trained on Apokolips with [[Granny Goodness]]. (A later [[retcon]] would say that Mannheim was the original leader of Intergang, dealing knowingly with Desaad. How Edge took over is unrevealed.)

Eventually Intergang was brought down by [[Clark Kent]] and [[Cat Grant]], Mannheim was arrested, but managed to escape. He attempted to disappear through a "Boom Tube" (a [[New Gods]] transporter), but it collapsed when he was half way through.

Some time later, Boss Moxie was released from prison. Discovering the Newsboy Legion were, seemingly, the same age as when he first fought them, he determined to find out how. Meeting [[Dabney Donnovan]], he arranged for himself and his former gang-members from the 1940s to be cloned into youthful bodies with superpowers. Using Vinnie Edge to arrange a meeting between Metropolis' gang-leaders, he killed them all, and declared himself the new head of Intergang. The new Intergang spent much of their time tracking down [[Jimmy Olsen]], whom Moxie believed knew Superman's [[secret identity]].

Following a short-lived attempt by Morgan Edge to regain control [[Lex Luthor]] gained control of Intergang, retaining Moxie as a figurehead. Moxie and his lieutenents were later captured by Superman. Intergang is currently run by a criminal cyberneticist named Frank Sixty.
