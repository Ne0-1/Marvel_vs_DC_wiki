'''Firefly''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC comics]]. Originally a petty criminal named Garfield Lynns, he was a victim of [[Gotham City]]'s severe [[poverty]]. Lynns was captured by [[Batman]] and [[Robin]] after his first robbery. Then, inspired by the glowing insect, Lynns took up [[arson]] as a hobby, but it soon turned to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. 

In an attempt to burn [[Gotham]] to the ground, Firefly was horribly burned when a chemical factory he set ablaze erupted in an explosion. 90 percent of his body is now scarred by burns, and he is incarcerated in [[Blackgate Prison]].

Firefly was among the numerous heroes and villains slain by the [[OMAC]]s in the pages of DC's the [[The OMAC Project]].

==In Other Media==
* In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and spin-offs, Firefly was voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In that version, he was a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer who became obsessed with the singer he worked for. He later reappeared in ''[[Justice League]]'' as one of the villains sprung from prison by [[Dr. Destiny]].
* [[Image:Firefly.jpg|frame| Firefly from Kids Wb and Cartoon Network show, the Batman]][[Jason Marsden]] currently plays Firefly in the animated TV show, ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. In the series, he's a mercenary whose identity hasn't been revealed, and a work-for-hire arsonist.  In ''The Big Heat'', Firefly was hired by [[GothCorp]] to finish off Gothcorp rivals. His weapons are beams with intense heat, and has a battle suit, and has a jetpack for flying. When one cord is disconnected, Firefly's flamethrowers and jetpack are not working. When the fuel to one of Firefly's flamethrowers are out, none of his flamethrowers are working. In the end, Batman puts Firefly hanging up and unmasked with a sign on him saying "GothCorp Employee of the Month". In ''Fire and Ice'', Firefly was hired by [[Mr. Freeze]] to turn Gotham City into permanent winter, and they team up.  So, in the beginning of this episode, he made a break-in, and stole a technological firm, and was pursued by Batman and the police.  Luckily, Firefly was able to use the tanker truck gas of fire to knock Batman off.  When Firefly gets access to the cyro-accelerator, he and Mr. Freeze get there.  So, Firefly puts one of the liquid nitrogens to the giant gun machine, and he and Mr. Freeze plan to ice the police force.  When Firefly accidentally damages the cyro-acclerator, Freeze ices him, but Firefly is able to break free, and fight Freeze.  When Freeze ices Firefly's jetpack, the fuel from his jetpack runs out, and he and Mr. Freeze are turned in by Batman.
