'''Firefly''' ('''Garfield Lynns''') is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]] created by France Herron and [[Dick Sprang]]. He first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #184 (June 1952) and is an enemy of [[Batman]]. 

== Character History ==
===Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]===
Garfield Lynns was a down-and-out film [[Visual effects]] expert who attempted to rob a theater by faking a fire, only to be stopped by Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He slipped out, and in the darkness Batman saw a distant firefly, which he mistook for Lynns' lit cigarette and chased in the wrong direction. Inspired, Lynns became The Firefly, using various lighting effects and optical illusions in his crimes.

The second Firefly is Ted Carson, an ostensibly wealthy gold-mine heir who gambles away the family fortune and turns to crime to maintain his lifestyle.  He is also Bruce Wayne's rival for the affections of Kathy Kane, aka [[Batwoman]].

===Post-Crisis===
Garfield Lynns was originally a pyrotechnic expert for motion pictures, but became a victim of [[Gotham City]]'s severe [[poverty]] and turned to crime, displaying signs of [[pyromania]]. Lynns was captured by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] after his first robbery. Lynns took up [[arson]] as a hobby, but it soon turned to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. Inspired by actual fireflies, he built a suit and became a professional arsonist. Early in his criminal career Firefly became the [[protégé]] of [[Killer Moth]], looking to duplicate the success of crime-fighting duo Batman and Robin. The alliance fell apart when Killer Moth realized the full extent of Firefly's madness and feared for his well-being.

In the [[Knightfall]] storyline, Firefly's plan was to burn all the places he didn't go to as a child. Firefly burnt down his first target and escaped when Batman arrived. When he burned down his second target Batman arrived again and Firefly escaped from him again. At his third target, Gotham Zoo, Batman arrived again and their fight ends up on a bridge where Batman captures Firefly and leaves him hanging on the bridge. 

In a recent attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly was horribly burned when a chemical factory he set erupted in an explosion. Ninety-percent of his body was burned, and he began his recovery in [[Blackgate Prison]].

He made a short appearance in the [[Justice League|JLA]] story arc "Crisis Of Conscience" (''JLA'' #115-#119) fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a [[diamond]] before Batman turned up. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensued, Firefly was knocked out and stayed down during the entire battle. He made another short appearance in the 2005 mini series ''[[Villains United]]'', when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempted to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly was among the numerous heroes and villains slain by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]''.

* In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Firefly was voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In "Torch Song" version, he was a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer who became obsessed with the singer he worked for (who was his ex-girlfriend). He also appeared in "Legends of the Dark Knight," in which he had been hired to burn down a building so that its owner could collect the insurance.  It was revealed by the producers in an article about the ''The New Batman Adventures'' in ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' #172 that they had been forbidden by the network to use him or any other [[pyromaniac]] character in ''The New Batman Adventures'' while it aired on [[Kids' WB]].

* He later reappeared on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', in the episode "[[Only a Dream (Justice League episode)|Only a Dream]]" as one of the villains (besides [[Volcana (DC Comics)|Volcana]], [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]) sprung from prison. He and Volcana were apprehended by [[Green Lantern]]. Mark Rolston reprises his role.

* The Firefly appears in the animated TV show, ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. In the series, he's a mercenary and arsonist for hire. His weapons and paraphernalia include a heat ray, a battle suit, and a jetpack(which sounds like a fly when it is used). He has appeared in the episodes ''The Big Heat'', ''Team Penguin'' and ''Fire and Ice''. In ''White Heat'', Firefly gains a new partner and lover, Blaze, and they both steal a Phosphorus Isotope to upgrade his battle suit. Unfortunely, an accident causes the isotope to mutate Firefly into [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]], who acquires greater powers, but is also driven insane.
