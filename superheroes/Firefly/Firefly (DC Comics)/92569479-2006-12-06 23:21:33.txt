'''Firefly''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]]. He is an enemy of [[Batman]]. 

== Character History ==

===Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]===
Garfield Lynns was a down-and-out film [[special effects]] expert who attempted to rob a theater by faking a fire, only to be stopped by Batman and Robin. He slipped out, and in the darkness Batman saw a distant firefly, which he mistook for Lynns' lit cigarette and chased in the wrong direction. Inspired by this, Lynns became The Firefly, using various lighting effects and optical illusions in his crimes.

===Post-Crisis===
'''Garfield Lynns''' was originally a pyrotechnic expert for motion pictures, but became a victim of [[Gotham City]]'s severe [[poverty]] and turned to crime. Lynns was captured by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] after his first robbery. Lynns took up [[arson]] as a hobby, but it soon turned to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. Inspired by actual fireflies, he built a suit and became a professional arsonist.

In a recent attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly was horribly burned when a chemical factory he set erupted in an explosion. Ninety-percent of his body was burned, and he began his recovery in [[Blackgate Prison]].

He made a short appearance in the [[Justice League|JLA]] story arc "Crisis Of Conscience" (''JLA'' #115-#119) fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a [[diamond]] before Batman turned up. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensued, Firefly was knocked out and stayed down during the entire battle. He made another short appearance in the 2005 mini series ''[[Villains United]]'', when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempted to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly was among the numerous heroes and villains slain by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]''.

* In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Firefly was voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In that version, he was a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer who became obsessed with the singer he worked for (who was his ex-girlfriend). It was revealed by the producers in an article about the [[The New Batman Adventures]] in ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' #172 that they had been forbidden by the network to use him or any other [[pyromaniac]] character in [[Batman: The Animated Series]] while it aired on the [[Fox Network]].

* He later reappeared in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' as one of the villains (besides [[Volcana (DC Comics)]], Luminus, [[Copperhead (DC Comics)]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]) sprung from prison. He and Volcana were apprehended by [[Green Lantern]]. Mark Rolston reprises his role.

* [[Jason Marsden]] currently plays Firefly in the animated TV show, ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. In the series, he's a mercenary and for-hire arsonist whose identity hasn't been revealed. In ''The Big Heat'', Firefly is hired by [[GothCorp]] to finish off Gothcorp rivals. His weapons and paraphernalia include a heat ray, a battle suit, and a jetpack.

Roundly bested by Batman, Firefly returns in ''Fire and Ice''. Firefly is hired by [[Mr. Freeze]] to help him turn Gotham City into a city of permanent winter. Firefly orchestrates the theft of a cryo-accelerator, which he and Freeze will use to freeze Gotham. However, during a battle with Batman, Firefly damages the device and Freeze attacks him. The former partners-in-crime are swiftly beaten by Batman and turned over to the authorities. Firefly returned in the fourth season as a member of [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin's]] Team Penguin.
