==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
Firefly is introduced as '''Garfield Lynns''', a down-and-out film [[visual effects]] expert who attempts to rob a theater by faking a fire, only to be stopped by Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He escapes, and in the darkness Batman sees a distant firefly, which he mistakes for Lynns' lit cigarette and chases in the wrong direction. Inspired, Lynns becomes The Firefly, using various lighting effects and [[optical illusion]]s in his crimes.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

As a costumed criminal, Firefly has fought not only Batman and Robin, but also [[Creeper (comics)|the Creeper]] and [[Outsiders (comics)|the Outsiders]].

The second Firefly is '''Ted Carson''', an ostensibly wealthy gold mine heir who gambles away the family fortune and turns to crime to maintain his lifestyle. He is also Bruce Wayne's rival for the affections of [[Katherine Kane|Kathy Kane]] (aka [[Batwoman]]). His first appearance is in Batman #126, Sept. 1959.<ref>''Batman'' #126</ref>

===Post-Crisis===
How much of Firefly's pre-Crisis history that is still intact is unclear, but post-Crisis, he works primarily with fire instead of lighting effects, and he also displays a pyromaniac streak.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Garfield Lynns is originally a pyrotechnic expert for motion pictures, but falls victim to [[Gotham City]]'s severe [[poverty]] and turns to crime, displaying signs of [[pyromania]]. Lynns is captured by Batman and Robin after his first robbery. He takes up [[arson]] as a hobby, but it soon turns to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. Inspired by actual fireflies, he builds a suit and becomes a professional arsonist. Early in his criminal career Firefly becomes the [[protégé]] of [[Killer Moth]], looking to duplicate the success of crime-fighting duo Batman and Robin. The alliance falls apart when Killer Moth realizes the full extent of Firefly's madness and fears for his own well-being.

In the ''[[Knightfall]]'' storyline, Firefly's plan after his escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] is to burn all the places he didn't go to as a child. He successfully destroys his first two targets, but Batman captures him at the site of his third, the Gotham Zoo. He is one of the main villains in part 1, but is captured. He has been locked up so long he has been mostly forgotten about. ''Knightfall'' marks one of the few moments where Lynns face is revealed; he has black hair with white highlights.

In a recent attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly is horribly burned when the chemical factory he targeted explodes. He suffers burns over 90 percent of his body (what portion of his body isn't burnt has yet to be revealed), and is ultimately sentenced to [[Blackgate Prison]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> He was one of the inmates of Blackgate when it was under the control of [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] during the ''[[No Man's Land]]'' story arc. When [[Nightwing]] was captured trying to retake Blackgate from Lock-Up, Firefly (now wearing a mask over his face) wanted to kill him and wear his skin over his burned body. <ref> ''Nightwing'' #35-39</ref>

He makes a short appearance in the [[Justice League|JLA]] story arc "Crisis Of Conscience"<ref>''JLA'' #115-#119</ref> fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a [[diamond]] before Batman arrives. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensues, Firefly is knocked out and remains unconscious during the entire battle. He makes another short appearance in the 2005 mini series ''[[Villains United]]'', when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempts to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly is among the numerous heroes and villains apparently murdered by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', although he later appears alive in ''[[Villains United|Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special]]'' and ''[[Gotham Underground]]''.

Firefly appears with Mr. Freeze facing the [[Batman]] (though Firefly is wearing the same uniform as the Firefly design of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'').<ref>''[[Superman/Batman]]'' Annual #3</ref>

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Firefly was with Cheetah III's [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was created. He was defeated by Wonder Woman alongside [[Shrapnel (DC Comics)|Shrapnel]], [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]], and [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]].

Firefly is recruited by a new Black Mask to a part of a group of villains that aiming to take over Gotham, but he follows his own agenda. Inspired on the chemicals that Black Mask used on him, Firefly inserts chips in Gothamites in order to make them burn.<ref>"Batman - Streets of Gotham #1"</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In his Pre-Crisis appearances, Firefly utilizes tricks using colored lights in his crimes.

In his Post-Crisis appearances, Firefly is an expert in pyrotechnics and explosives. He has thorough knowledge of inflammable agents. His suit contains a flamethrower, grenade launchers, and an extensive arsenal of fire-creating weapons. The fixed wings mounted on his back allow him to glide on the updrafts of the fires he creates.

==Other versions==
===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Firefly is a member of the [[Ambush Bug]]s led by Canterbury Cricket. He is killed in battle against the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]].<ref>''Flashpoint: The Canterbury Cricket'' #1</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Firefly was voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In "Torch Song", this version of Garfield Lynns is a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer who kidnaps his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Cassidy, who had fired and dumped him after he botched a pyrotechnics display at one of her concerts. He made an attempt on her life until Batman arrived. Although Batgirl rescues Cassidy, Lynns escapes and creates the armor that enables him to become Firefly. He smokes out the building Cassidy and her crew are in, enabling him to make off with Cassidy. Using a metal armor, Batman finds Firefly at an abandoned factor and fights him. Batman defeats Firefly and rescues Cassidy, but she develops [[pyrophobia]] as a result of her experience as seen in the final scene of the episode. Firefly also appears in the episode "Legends of the Dark Knight" in which he has been hired to burn down a building so that its owner could collect the insurance. A group of children stumble across his plans, yet Batman saves them and defeats Firefly;. It is revealed by the producers in an article about ''The New Batman Adventures'' in ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' #172 that they had been forbidden by the network to use him or any other [[pyromaniac]] character in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' while it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].
