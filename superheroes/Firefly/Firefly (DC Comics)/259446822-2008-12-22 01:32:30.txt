== Character history ==
===Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]===
Firefly is introduced as Garfield Lynns, a down-and-out film [[Visual effects]] expert who attempts to rob a theater by faking a fire, only to be stopped by Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He escapes, and in the darkness Batman sees a distant firefly, which he mistakes for Lynns' lit cigarette and chases in the wrong direction. Inspired, Lynns becomes The Firefly, using various lighting effects and [[optical illusion]]s in his crimes.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

As a costumed criminal, Firefly has fought not only Batman and Robin, but also [[Creeper (comics)|the Creeper]] and [[Outsiders (comics)|the Outsiders]].

The second Firefly is Ted Carson, an ostensibly wealthy gold-mine heir who gambles away the family fortune and turns to crime to maintain his lifestyle. He is also Bruce Wayne's rival for the affections of Kathy Kane, aka [[Batwoman]].

===Post-Crisis===
How much of Firefly's pre-Crisis history that is still intact is unclear, but post-Crisis, he works primarily with fire instead of lighting effects, and he also displays a pyromaniac streak.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Garfield Lynns is originally a pyrotechnic expert for motion pictures, but falls victim to [[Gotham City]]'s severe [[poverty]] and turns to crime, displaying signs of [[pyromania]]. Lynns is captured by Batman and Robin after his first robbery. He takes up [[arson]] as a hobby, but it soon turns to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. Inspired by actual fireflies, he builds a suit and becomes a professional arsonist. Early in his criminal career Firefly becomes the [[protégé]] of [[Killer Moth]], looking to duplicate the success of crime-fighting duo Batman and Robin. The alliance falls apart when Killer Moth realizes the full extent of Firefly's madness and fears for his own well-being.

In the ''[[Knightfall]]'' storyline, Firefly's plan after his escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] is to burn all the places he didn't go to as a child. He successfully destroys his first two targets, but Batman captures him at the site of his third, the Gotham Zoo. 

In a recent attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly is horribly burned when the chemical factory he targeted explodes. He suffers burns over 90 percent of his body, and is ultimately sentenced to [[Blackgate Prison]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He makes a short appearance in the [[Justice League|JLA]] story arc "Crisis Of Conscience"<ref>''JLA'' #115-#119</ref> fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a [[diamond]] before Batman arrives. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensues, Firefly is knocked out and remains unconscious during the entire battle. He makes another short appearance in the 2005 mini series ''[[Villains United]]'', when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempts to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly is among the numerous heroes and villains apparently murdered by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', although he later appears alive in ''[[Villains United|Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special]]'' and ''[[Gotham Underground]]''.

==Other Media==
===DC animated universe===
* In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Firefly was voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In "Torch Song" version, Garfield Lynns is a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer who kidnaps his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Cassidy, who had fired and dumped him after he botched a pyrotechnics display at one of her concerts. Although Batman rescues Cassidy, Lynns escapes and creates the armor that enables him to become Firefly. He smokes out the building Cassidy and her crew are in, enabling him to make off with Cassidy. Batman defeats Firefly and rescues Cassidy, but she develops [[pyrophobia]]. Firefly also appears in the episode "Legends of the Dark Knight," in which he has been hired to burn down a building so that its owner could collect the insurance. A group of children stumble across his plans, yet Batman saves them and defeats Firefly. It is revealed by the producers in an article about the ''The New Batman Adventures'' in ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' #172 that they had been forbidden by the network to use him or any other [[pyromaniac]] character in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' while it aired on [[FOX]].

* He later reappears on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' in the episode "Only a Dream" as one of the villains (besides [[Volcana (DC Comics)|Volcana]], [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]) sprung from prison. He and Volcana are apprehended by [[Green Lantern]]. Mark Rolston reprises his role.

* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Firefly's costume can be seen on display in the Batcave.

===''The Batman''===
* The Firefly appears in the animated TV show, ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. In the series, he is a [[mercenary]] and arsonist for hire. His weapons and paraphernalia include a heat ray, a battle suit, and a jetpack (which sounds like a fly when it is used). He has appeared in the episodes "The Big Heat", "Fire and Ice" and "Team Penguin". In "White Heat", Firefly gains a new partner and lover, Blaze, and they both steal a [[phosphorus]] [[isotope]] to upgrade his battle suit. An accident causes the isotope to mutate Firefly into [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]], who acquires greater powers, but is also driven insane.

===''The Dark Knight''===
* An action figure for Firefly was revealed at the New York Toy Fair on [[February 18]], [[2008]] for the toy line of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' as part of the "inspired by" line.
