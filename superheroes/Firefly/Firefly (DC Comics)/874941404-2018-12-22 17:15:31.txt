'''Firefly''' ('''Garfield Lynns''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books|American]] [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by [[France Herron]] and [[Dick Sprang]], the character first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #184 (June 1952) as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Firefly | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 122  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> While he originally utilized lighting effects to commit crimes, Lynns was later re-imagined as a psychopathic [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] with an obsessive compulsion to start fires, and this darker depiction of Firefly has since endured as a member of the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis===
'''Garfield Lynns''' was a down-and-out film [[special effects]] expert who attempts to rob a theatre by faking a fire, but was stopped by [[Batman]] and Robin. He escapes, and in the darkness Batman sees a distant firefly, which he mistakes for Lynns' lit cigarette and chases in the wrong direction. Inspired, Lynns becomes the Firefly, using various lighting effects and [[optical illusion]]s in his crimes.<ref name="dc-ency"/> As a costumed criminal, Firefly has fought not only Batman and Robin, but also the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].

===Post-Crisis===
How much of Firefly's pre-Crisis history that is still intact is unclear, but post-Crisis shows he works primarily with fire instead of lighting effects, and he also displays pyromaniacal tendencies.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Garfield Lynns is originally a pyrotechnic expert for motion pictures, but falls victim to [[Gotham City]]'s severe poverty and turns to crime, displaying signs of pyromania. Lynns is captured by Batman and Robin after his first robbery. He takes up arson as a hobby, but it soon turns to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. Inspired by actual fireflies, he builds a suit and becomes a professional arsonist. Early in his criminal career Firefly becomes the [[protégé]] of [[Killer Moth]], looking to duplicate the success of crimefighting duo Batman and Robin. The alliance falls apart when Killer Moth realizes the full extent of Firefly's madness and fears for his own well-being.

In the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' storyline, Firefly's plan after his escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] is to burn all the places he did not get to go to as a child. He successfully destroys his first two targets, but Batman captures him at the site of his third, the Gotham Zoo. He is one of the main villains in part 1, but is captured. He has been locked up so long he has been mostly forgotten about. ''Knightfall'' marks one of the few moments where Lynns' face is revealed; he has black hair with white highlights.

In his attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly is horribly burned when the chemical factory he targeted explodes. He suffers burns over 90 percent of his body, and is ultimately sentenced to [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate Prison]].<ref name="dc-ency" /> He was one of the inmates of Blackgate when it was under the control of [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] during the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc. When Nightwing was captured trying to retake Blackgate from Lock-Up, Firefly (wearing a mask over his face) wanted to kill him and wear his skin over his burned body.<ref>''Nightwing'' #35–39</ref>

During the ''[[DC One Million]]'' crisis, Firefly nearly burned down Gotham while infected with the [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]] virus, requiring Nightwing and Robin to work with the future Batman to stop him.

Firefly makes a short appearance in the [[Justice League of America]] story arc "Crisis Of Conscience"<ref>''JLA'' #115–119</ref> fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a diamond before Batman arrives. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensues, Firefly is knocked unconscious and remains that way during the entire battle. He makes another short appearance in the 2005 miniseries ''[[Villains United]]'', when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempts to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly is among the numerous heroes and villains apparently murdered by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', although he later appears alive in ''[[Villains United|Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special]]'' and ''[[Gotham Underground]]''.

Firefly appears with [[Mr. Freeze]] facing Batman (though Firefly is wearing the same uniform as the Firefly design of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'').<ref>''[[Superman/Batman]] Annual'' #3</ref> He and Mr. Freeze are again shown as having worked together a month after the events of the Crisis, Batman working with the currently-redeemed [[Harvey Dent]] to take them down before he takes his year of absence while leaving Dent to guard Gotham.

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Firefly was with [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was created. He was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] alongside [[Shrapnel (DC Comics)|Shrapnel]], [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]], and [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]].

Firefly is recruited by a new [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to a part of a group of villains that are aiming to take over Gotham, but he follows his own agenda. Inspired by the chemicals that Black Mask used on him, Firefly inserts chips into Gothamites in order to make them burn.<ref>''Batman — Streets of Gotham'' #1</ref> Not long after the identity of the new Black Mask was revealed to be Jeremiah Arkham, Firefly was arrested and put into Arkham Asylum. A short time later Firefly is broken out of Arkham Asylum by [[Dick Grayson]], who has assumed the mantle of Batman, to assist him in gaining access to Sebastian Blackspell's closest friends. Batman (Dick) desires to know what Blackspell's true intentions are in regards to killing the [[Riddler]].

==Powers and abilities==
The Pre-Crisis depiction of Garfield Lynns used tricks with colored lights and optical illusions to commit crimes.

The darker and more violent Post-Crisis depiction of Garfield Lynns is an expert in pyrotechnics and explosives, with a thorough knowledge of inflammable agents. After he is burnt and horribly scarred by a blaze he started at a chemical factory that went out-of-control, Lynns made an insulated, fire-retardant battle-suit to protect himself. This specialized outfit is designed to house the various weapons in his armament, including a military-grade flamethrower, napalm, grenade launchers, and a self-designed rig that projects a sword-like blade of superheated plasma for close combat purposes. The suit is also equipped with wings mounted on its back to serve as a [[jetpack]] that provides high-speed flight.

==Other versions==
===Ted Carson===
A second Firefly named '''Ted Carson''' was introduced in ''Batman'' #126, and was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]].
Ted Carson was an ostentatiously wealthy gold mine heir who gambles away the family fortune and turns to crime to maintain his lifestyle. He is also Bruce Wayne's rival for the affections of Kathy Kane (aka Batwoman). His first time as Firefly occurred when he crashes the party at the Carson Mansion where Bruce Wayne and [[Dick Grayson]] were attending. Batman and Robin attempt to interfere with Firefly's theft of gold nuggets from the Carson Family's first gold strike, but Firefly blinds them momentarily with a powerful light beam from his helmet and ensures his gang's getaway. Later, Wayne finds Kathy spurning him for Carson causing him to exclaim that he now has both the Firefly and Carson to worry about. Soon, Batman, Robin, and [[Batwoman]] are summoned to combat the Firefly at the Gotham Glassworks, but they discover that the Firefly possesses a sonic weapon that can shatter glass and are forced to take cover while the criminals flee, though one of the criminals is caught. Later, Bruce calls upon Kathy, only to find Carson already there. After a few minutes, Ted gets up to leave and asks Bruce to see Kathy to dinner. She pleads a headache and gets Bruce's raincoat still leaving him in the dark as to whether or not she suspects him of being Batman. After Bruce leaves, a fallen paper reveals to Kathy the Firefly's plans to rob the Gotham Museum of Natural History. She becomes Batwoman and travels to Carson's house. Batwoman tells Ted to become Batman and accompany her to foil the Firefly's plans as she reveals that she saw him change from a uniform into civilian clothes at the party. Carson leaves, and emerges in his uniform which happens to be Firefly's costume. He proceeds to tie Batwoman up and joins his gang at the museum attempting to steal silver relics. But Batman and Robin have deduced his next crime-site and Batwoman has freed herself, and the crime-fighters bring the criminals down.<ref>''Batman'' #126</ref>

In ''[[The New 52]]'' reboot, Ted Carson appears in ''Nightwing Annual'' #1. He is a former high school [[teacher]] who tries to incinerate everything that will separate him from his ex-girlfriend Cindy Cooke, though he is defeated by Nightwing and Batgirl.<ref>''Nightwing Annual'' #1</ref>

In the [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch, Ted Carson and [[Killer Moth]] team up to hunt and kill Batman in ''All-Star Batman'' after [[Two-Face]] offers millions of dollars to anyone to kill Batman for him. Like most of the people who try to kill Batman, Firefly and Killer Moth fail.<ref>''All-Star Batman'' #1</ref> He is later seen having as one of the many villains of Batman's Rogues Gallery to be beaten down by Bane in his attempt to reach Batman in Arkham.<ref>Batman (vol. 3) #19</ref> During the gang war between the Joker and the Riddler, Firefly is shown as part of [[Riddler]]'s team.<ref>''Batman'' Vol. 3 #26</ref>

===Bridgit Pike===
Ted Carson's protege, '''Bridgit Pike''' (a character created in the TV series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''), adopts the identity of '''Lady Firefly'''. Pike first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #988 (September 2018), and was created by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and Stephen Segovia. She is hired along with Carson by [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra]] to take out Batman while he is investigating a murder.<ref>''Detective Comics #988</ref>

===''Smallville Season Eleven''===
Firefly appears in ''[[Smallville#Season Eleven|Smallville Season Eleven]]'' comic in [[Gotham City]] as the yellow rings of Parallax head to [[Arkham Asylum]]. There, Batman and Nightwing are doing their best to contain the newly powered inmates of Arkham, including Firefly, who have already been transformed into Yellow Lanterns. Luckily, [[Superman]] arrives just in time to offer assistance to Batman and Nightwing. Superman tries to control the situation but his inexperience with his power ring doesn't help at all, so [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and Firefly attack him, while he is protecting the doctors.
 
After this, the Yellow Lanterns stand still and kneel before him. Parallax suddenly appears behind Superman, having [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] under his control. Batman steals Firefly's ring. In Gotham, Batman fights with Firefly, when suddenly he gets a call from Tess Mercer and Chloe Sullivan in [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]], who ask him to secure a single yellow ring for them. Batman fights with Firefly and during the battle he tricks Firefly into colliding to a building. There Batman finds the chance and takes the yellow ring (which tempts him to become its new bearer) from Firefly and then puts it on his analyzer on the Batplane and sends the data to Watchtower and [[S.T.A.R. Labs]].

After their rings get rebooted and they lose their powers, the inmates of Arkham fall from the sky unable to do anything to save themselves, but fortunately Superman manages to save them all. After Parallax's defeat, all the now depowered criminals return to Arkham Asylum.

===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Firefly is a member of the [[Ambush Bug]]s led by Canterbury Cricket. He is killed in battle against the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]].<ref>''Flashpoint: The Canterbury Cricket'' #1</ref>

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
Firefly appears as one of the Batman and [[Wonder Woman]] rogues attacking the two heroes wedding. Firefly is seen battling [[the Martian Manhunter]]. [[Clayface]] watched footage of the attack on the wedding causing him to realize fire weakened the Martian Manhunter.

===''Batman v Superman''===
The Garfield Lynns version of Firefly was introduced to the [[DC Extended Universe]] in the [[tie-in]] [[prequel]] [[comic]] to ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', available at [[Dr. Pepper]].<ref name="BvS comic">{{Cite news |first=James|last=Whitbrook|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-going-into-batman-v-superma-1757084996|title=Everything You Need to Know Going into Batman v Superman, According to Dr Pepper|publisher=io9.com|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref> Before the events of film, Lynns was working with 2 low level thugs in-order to bomb a warehouse full of valuables. While they carry out the plan, they discuss about the Batman, how when he first appeared, he attacked so fast you couldn't even see him. Suddenly, Batman appears and uses a [[Batarang]] to destroy the detonator held by Firefly and proceeds to engage Firefly who uses his flamethrower to unsuccessfully attack Batman. Batman ultimately subdues him and leaves the 2 low-level criminals tied up on a sidewalk for the police to find. While this all happens, [[Lex Luthor]] ominously watches all this unfold on a CCTV.

* The Garfield Lynns incarnation of Firefly has appeared in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. 
** Firefly appeared in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In this version, Garfield Lynns was a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer. Introduced in "Torch Song", Lynns kidnaps his ex-girlfriend Cassidy (voiced by [[Karla DeVito]]), a singer who had fired and dumped him after he botched a pyrotechnics display at one of her concerts. He made an attempt on her life during her performance until [[Batman]] arrived. Although [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] rescues Cassidy, Lynns escapes and creates the armor that enables him to be Firefly. He smokes out the building Cassidy and her crew are in, enabling him to make off with Cassidy. Batman, in a fireproof metal armor, finds Firefly at an abandoned factory. After a fight, Batman defeats Firefly and rescues Cassidy (although Cassidy develops a case of pyrophobia as a result of her experience as seen at the episode's end). Firefly also appears in "Legends of the Dark Knight" in which he has been hired to burn down a building so that its owner could collect the insurance. A group of children stumble across his plans, yet Batman saves them and defeats Firefly. The producers had wanted to use the character in the earlier series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' but were forbidden by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to use any pyromaniac character.<ref>{{cite news | last = Allstetter | first= Rob | date = August 1997 | title = The Dark Knight Returns | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 50–54}}</ref>
** Firefly later reappears on the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, with Mark Rolston reprising his role. In the episode "Only a Dream", he escapes out of prison alongside [[Volcana (DC Comics)|Volcana]], [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Volcana has also developed a liking to him due to their fire-based attacks. Eventually, Firefly and Volcana are apprehended by [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] and [[Batman]].
** Firefly was alluded to in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. In the episode "Black Out", Firefly's costume can be seen on display in the [[Batcave]] which is destroyed during the new [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]]'s first fight with [[Inque]].

[[Image:Firefly batman.jpg|right|thumb|Firefly as he appeared in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'']]
* The Garfield Lynns incarnation of Firefly appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. A running gag in the episode "White Heat" is people mistakenly call this version insulting insect-related names (e.g., Bugman, Bumblebee, etc.). In the series, he first appeared in "The Big Heat" as a mercenary and arsonist for hire. His weapons and paraphernalia include a heat ray, a battle suit, and a jetpack (which sounds like a fly when it is used). He was hired by [[GothCorp]] to attack its rivals, only to be defeated by [[Batman]] leaving evidence that exposed Firefly's connection to GothCorp. He returned in "Fire and Ice" to team up with [[Mr. Freeze]]. Freeze and Firefly turn on each other and Firefly is frozen. He joined Team Penguin in "Team Penguin" along with [[Killer Croc]], [[Killer Moth]] and [[Ragdoll (comics)|Ragdoll]]. Firefly is defeated when Batgirl electrocutes him. In "White Heat", Firefly gains his new partner and lover Dr. Jane 'Blaze' Blazedale (voiced by [[Rachael MacFarlane]]) and they both steal a [[phosphorus]] [[isotope]] to upgrade his battle suit. An accident causes the phosphorus isotope to mutate Firefly into the creature [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]]. He acquires greater powers, but is also driven insane soon after his transformation. He attempts to destroy Gotham with a nuclear meltdown in an insane attempt to be remembered, while his body threatens to meltdown which would also destroy Gotham. Batman manages to freeze Phosphorus with liquid nitrogen. Phosphorus is put in a cell in Arkham which contains a special gas mixture that keeps him stable.
* Firefly appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. This version is based on the Pre-Crisis version of Firefly. In "A Bat Divided!", he was seen at a bar where the bad guys hang out until [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up. In "Emperor Joker!", Firefly uses his light powers to cause Batman problems and create his Rainbow Creature. Batman uses his rainbow costumes to defeat him. In the [[series finale]] "Mitefall", a CGI Firefly is on [[Bat-Mite]]'s TV.
* Firefly appears in the web series, ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[Khary Payton]].

===Film===
* In ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', Firefly's equipment can be seen in the storage room next to [[Killer Moth]] and [[Maxie Zeus]]'s equipments when the [[Suicide Squad]] was looking for [[the Riddler]]'s Cane.
* Firefly appears in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', voiced by [[Steve Blum]]. He appears as one of [[Talia al Ghul]]'s henchmen and frequently teams up with [[Killer Moth]] to attack enemies from above. Firefly is presumably killed when his jet pack is damaged and causes him to fly into an engine shaft.

===Video games===
====Lego series====
* The Garfield Lynns version of Firefly is featured as an unlockable villain through the "Villain Hunt" in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]''. Firefly's costume here is similar to his look in ''The Batman''.
* The Garfield Lynns version of Firefly appears in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'' as part of the [[Legion of Doom]], with Robin Atkin Downes reprising his role. He first appears at the end of the first level alongside [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. When [[Killer Croc]] steals a map of the sewers, they head for the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]] to meet [[Lex Luthor]], who has disguised himself as [[Hawkman]], and enter a portal that takes them to the Watchtower. He uses his flamethrower to knock out [[Martian Manhunter]]. He is the first member of the Legion of Doom that is fought as a boss. After he is defeated, he has no dialogue for the rest of the game. In the final cutscene, when Lex Luthor becomes president, he can be seen counting cash. The [[Justice League]] then appears and takes him and the other members to [[Arkham Asylum]]. Unlike the other members, he is only playable in Free Play Mode. His costume is based on his appearance in ''The Batman''.
* The Garfield Lynns version of Firefly appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.

====Batman: Arkham====
Garfield Lynns / Firefly is featured in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game series, where he is voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CrispinFreeman/status/399039906066231296 |title=Yes, that is me as Firefly. |last=Freeman |first=Crispin|publisher=Twitter|date=November 9, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111071809/https://twitter.com/CrispinFreeman/status/399039906066231296 |archivedate=December 13, 2018 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Firefly first appears at a meeting that the Joker holds with the assassins at the Gotham Royal Hotel. Firefly later attacks the [[Gotham City|Gotham]] Pioneers Bridge to draw Batman out, planting explosives throughout the entire structure in addition to taking hostages. Batman ultimately manages to incapacitate Firefly's bombs with [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] Lieutenant [[Commissioner Gordon|James Gordon]]'s help, before deactivating Firefly's jetpack and leaving him to be taken into police custody.<ref>{{cite web |first=Brandon |last=Guerrie |url=http://www.primagames.com/games/batman-arkham-origins/walkthrough/batman-arkham-origins-walkthrough-how-apprehend-firefly-pioneers-bridge |title=Batman: Arkham Origins Walkthrough- How to Apprehend Firefly at Pioneer's Bridge |publisher=Prima Games |date=October 2013 |accessdate=December 13, 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PYAu5uFo?url=http://www.primagames.com/games/batman-arkham-origins/walkthrough/batman-arkham-origins-walkthrough-how-apprehend-firefly-pioneers-bridge |archivedate=December 13, 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>
* Firefly returns in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' (2015). In the side mission "Gotham on Fire", Batman discovers that Firefly is burning down firehouses across the evacuated Gotham City. Each time after putting out one of the fires, Batman then pursues Firefly in the Batmobile while evading burning obstacles until he can get close enough to tackle Firefly to the ground and punch him. After the third instance of this, Batman controls Firefly's flight gear to take them to the Gotham City Police Department as Batman leaves him for the arriving police officers. It is also revealed through "The Line of Duty" side mission that the fire chief Raymond Underhill had been aiding Firefly by giving him access codes and addresses of abandoned buildings to prevent most of the firefighters from losing their jobs.
