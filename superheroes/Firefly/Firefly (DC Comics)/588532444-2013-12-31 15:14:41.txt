==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis===
Firefly is introduced as '''Garfield Lynns''', a down-and-out film [[visual effects]] expert who attempts to rob a theater by faking a fire, only to be stopped by Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He escapes, and in the darkness Batman sees a distant firefly, which he mistakes for Lynns' lit cigarette and chases in the wrong direction. Inspired, Lynns becomes The Firefly, using various lighting effects and [[optical illusion]]s in his crimes.<ref name="dc-ency"/> As a costumed criminal, Firefly has fought not only Batman and Robin, but also [[Creeper (comics)|the Creeper]] and [[Outsiders (comics)|the Outsiders]].

The second Firefly is '''Ted Carson''', an ostensibly wealthy gold mine heir who gambles away the family fortune and turns to crime to maintain his lifestyle. He is also Bruce Wayne's rival for the affections of Kathy Kane (aka [[Batwoman]]). His first appearance is in Batman #126, Sept. 1959.<ref>''Batman'' #126</ref>

===Post-Crisis===
How much of Firefly's pre-Crisis history that is still intact is unclear, but post-Crisis, he works primarily with fire instead of lighting effects, and he also displays a pyromaniac streak.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Garfield Lynns is originally a pyrotechnic expert for motion pictures, but falls victim to [[Gotham City]]'s severe [[poverty]] and turns to crime, displaying signs of [[pyromania]]. Lynns is captured by Batman and Robin after his first robbery. He takes up [[arson]] as a hobby, but it soon turns to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. Inspired by actual fireflies, he builds a suit and becomes a professional arsonist. Early in his criminal career Firefly becomes the [[protégé]] of [[Killer Moth]], looking to duplicate the success of crime-fighting duo Batman and Robin. The alliance falls apart when Killer Moth realizes the full extent of Firefly's madness and fears for his own well-being.

In the ''[[Knightfall]]'' storyline, Firefly's plan after his escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] is to burn all the places he didn't go to as a child. He successfully destroys his first two targets, but Batman captures him at the site of his third, the Gotham Zoo. He is one of the main villains in part 1, but is captured. He has been locked up so long he has been mostly forgotten about. ''Knightfall'' marks one of the few moments where Lynns face is revealed; he has black hair with white highlights.

In a recent attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly is horribly burned when the chemical factory he targeted explodes. He suffers burns over 90 percent of his body (what portion of his body isn't burnt has yet to be revealed), and is ultimately sentenced to [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate Prison]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> He was one of the inmates of Blackgate when it was under the control of [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] during the ''[[No Man's Land]]'' story arc. When [[Nightwing]] was captured trying to retake Blackgate from Lock-Up, Firefly (now wearing a mask over his face) wanted to kill him and wear his skin over his burned body.<ref>''Nightwing'' #35-39</ref>

He makes a short appearance in the [[Justice League|JLA]] story arc "Crisis Of Conscience"<ref>''JLA'' #115-#119</ref> fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a [[diamond]] before Batman arrives. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensues, Firefly is knocked out and remains unconscious during the entire battle. He makes another short appearance in the 2005 mini series ''[[Villains United]]'', when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempts to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly is among the numerous heroes and villains apparently murdered by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', although he later appears alive in ''[[Villains United|Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special]]'' and ''[[Gotham Underground]]''.

Firefly appears with Mr. Freeze facing the [[Batman]] (though Firefly is wearing the same uniform as the Firefly design of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'').<ref>''[[Superman/Batman]]'' Annual #3</ref>

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Firefly was with Cheetah III's [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was created. He was defeated by Wonder Woman alongside [[Shrapnel (DC Comics)|Shrapnel]], [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]], and [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]].

Firefly is recruited by a new Black Mask to a part of a group of villains that aiming to take over Gotham, but he follows his own agenda. Inspired on the chemicals that Black Mask used on him, Firefly inserts chips in Gothamites in order to make them burn.<ref>"Batman - Streets of Gotham #1"</ref>

===The New 52===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), a new version of Firefly appears in ''Nightwing Annual'' #1. The Firefly seen is Ted Carson, a former high school teacher who tries to incinerate everything that will separate him from his ex-girlfriend, Cindy Cooke. He seemingly murders Garfield Lynns along the way and attempts to use Lynns (a known pyromaniac) as a scapegoat for his crimes.<ref>''Nightwing Annual'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In his Pre-Crisis appearances, Firefly utilizes tricks with colored lights in his crimes.

In his Post-Crisis appearances, Firefly is an expert in pyrotechnics and explosives. He has thorough knowledge of inflammable agents. His suit contains a flamethrower, grenade launchers, and an extensive arsenal of fire-creating weapons. The fixed wings mounted on his back allow him to glide on the updrafts of the fires he creates.

==Other versions==
===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Firefly is a member of the [[Ambush Bug]]s led by Canterbury Cricket. He is killed in battle against the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]].<ref>''Flashpoint: The Canterbury Cricket'' #1</ref>

* In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Firefly was voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In "Torch Song", this version of Garfield Lynns is a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer who kidnaps his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Cassidy, who had fired and dumped him after he botched a pyrotechnics display at one of her concerts. He made an attempt on her life during one of her performances until Batman arrived. Although Batgirl rescues Cassidy, Lynns escapes and creates the armor that enables him to become Firefly. He smokes out the building Cassidy and her crew are in, enabling him to make off with Cassidy. Using a fireproof metal armor, Batman finds Firefly at an abandoned factory and after a fight, defeats him and rescues Cassidy (however, she develops a massive case [[pyrophobia]] as a result of her experience as seen at the end of the episode). Firefly also appears in the episode "Legends of the Dark Knight" in which he has been hired to burn down a building so that its owner could collect the insurance. A group of children stumble across his plans, yet Batman saves them and defeats Firefly. The producers had wanted to use Firefly in the earlier series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', but were forbidden by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to use any [[pyromaniac]] character.<ref>{{cite news | last = Allstetter | first= Rob | date = August 1997 | title = The Dark Knight Returns | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 50–54}}</ref>

* Firefly later reappears on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' in the episode "Only a Dream" with Mark Rolston reprising his role. He is one of the villains (besides [[Volcana (DC Comics)|Volcana]], [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]) sprung from prison. He and Volcana (to whom he has developed a liking due to her fire-based powers) are apprehended by [[Green Lantern]] and [[Batman]].

* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', Firefly's costume can be seen on display in the Batcave.

[[Image:Firefly batman.jpg|right|thumb|Firefly as he appeared in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'']]
* Firefly appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. In the series, he first appeared in "The Big Heat" as a [[mercenary]] and arsonist for hire. His weapons and paraphernalia include a heat ray, a battle suit, and a jetpack (which sounds like a fly when it is used). He was hired by GothCorp to attack its rivals, only to be defeated by Batman who left evidence that exposed Firefly's connection to GothCorp. He returned in "Fire and Ice", where he teamed up with [[Mr. Freeze]]. He joined Team Penguin in the episode "Team Penguin" along with [[Killer Croc]], [[Killer Moth]] and [[Ragdoll (comics)|Ragdoll]]. In "White Heat", Firefly gains a new partner and lover named Dr. Jane "Blaze" Blazedale and they both steal a [[phosphorus]] [[isotope]] to upgrade his battle suit. An accident causes the phosphorus isotope to mutate Firefly into a creature called [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]]. He acquires greater powers, but is also driven insane soon after his transformation.

* Firefly appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. This version is based on the Pre-Crisis version of Firefly. In "A Bat Divided!", he was seen at a bar where the bad guys hang out until [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up. In "Emperor Joker!", Firefly uses his light powers to cause Batman problems and create his Rainbow Creature. Batman uses his rainbow costumes to defeat him. In the series finale "Mitefall," a CGI Firefly is on [[Bat-Mite]]'s TV.

* Firefly appears in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode "Burned" portrayed by [[Andrew Dunbar]]. This version is depicted as a former [[firefighter]]. After being left for dead and brutally scarred in a fire years prior, he becomes embittered and goes after members of his former company.<ref>http://www.heroesandhellions.com/daily-debriefing/new-arrow-promo-villain-confirmed/</ref> He is never shown in his traditional costume (instead wearing a firefighter's uniform), with the name 'Firefly' being a nickname he and his graduation class acquired after they joined the fire department, each of them possessing a tattoo of a firefly on their hands. At the episode's conclusion, after Oliver Queen stops him from killing the last member of his class, he walks into the flames that he had set earlier, and is subsequently burnt to death.

===Video games===
* Firefly is also one of the bosses in the Batman Leapster Game

* Firefly is featured as an unlockable villain through the "Villain Hunt" in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[LEGO Batman: The Video Game]]''. Firefly's costume here is similar to his look in ''The Batman''.

* A biography for Lynns (as Firefly) can be found in the 2009 game ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''. It can be unlocked by scanning newspaper clippings of him in the Patient Observatory in the Medical Facility as the answer to one of Riddler's riddles. Also, his flamethrowing backpack is there. According to the biography, 90% of his body was covered in burn scars after an accident.

* While not physically appearing in the game ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', it was revealed that Firefly was currently operating with Black Mask in his own newly formed gang and assisted him with his first (and successful) breakout attempt from the prison before the events of the game. However, during Black Mask's escape, Lynns disappeared and was left behind by the gang.

* The Garfield Lynns version of Firefly appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]].<ref name="FireflyVA">https://twitter.com/CrispinFreeman/status/399039906066231296</ref> He appears as one of the eight assassins hired by The Joker to kill Batman. He first appears at the assassin's meeting in the Royal Hotel, though he had no real involvement in the conference beyond simply showing up. After Batman leaves [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s hideout, he learns that Firefly is holding an entire bridge hostage to get his attention, planting bombs on both ends and inside the central pillar. Firefly also takes a train cart hostage as well as several police officers. His bombs are shut down by the combined efforts of Batman and the [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]], though he still manages to cause enough damage to the bridge on his own. The two battle after Batman shuts down the third bomb, and Firefly attempts to detonate during their fight, unaware that the bomb squad had already defused the fourth bomb. After realizing all his bombs have been shut down, Firefly chases Batman around the bridge before trapping him in flames. Batman grapples onto Firefly to save himself, and manages to smash him into one of the pillars before ripping off his wings and leaves him for the police. In this version, Firefly has burns covering over 90% of his body, including most of his face.
