==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
Firefly is introduced as Garfield Lynns, a down-and-out film [[visual effects]] expert who attempts to rob a theater by faking a fire, only to be stopped by Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He escapes, and in the darkness Batman sees a distant firefly, which he mistakes for Lynns' lit cigarette and chases in the wrong direction. Inspired, Lynns becomes The Firefly, using various lighting effects and [[optical illusion]]s in his crimes.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

As a costumed criminal, Firefly has fought not only Batman and Robin, but also [[Creeper (comics)|the Creeper]] and [[Outsiders (comics)|the Outsiders]].

The second Firefly is '''Ted Carson''', an ostensibly wealthy gold-mine heir who gambles away the family fortune and turns to crime to maintain his lifestyle. He is also Bruce Wayne's rival for the affections of Kathy Kane, aka [[Batwoman]]. His first appearance is in Batman #126, Sept. 1959.

===Post-Crisis===
How much of Firefly's pre-Crisis history that is still intact is unclear, but post-Crisis, he works primarily with fire instead of lighting effects, and he also displays a pyromaniac streak.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Garfield Lynns is originally a pyrotechnic expert for motion pictures, but falls victim to [[Gotham City]]'s severe [[poverty]] and turns to crime, displaying signs of [[pyromania]]. Lynns is captured by Batman and Robin after his first robbery. He takes up [[arson]] as a hobby, but it soon turns to an obsession; he believes he can see visions in the flames. Inspired by actual fireflies, he builds a suit and becomes a professional arsonist. Early in his criminal career Firefly becomes the [[protégé]] of [[Killer Moth]], looking to duplicate the success of crime-fighting duo Batman and Robin. The alliance falls apart when Killer Moth realizes the full extent of Firefly's madness and fears for his own well-being.

In the ''[[Knightfall]]'' storyline, Firefly's plan after his escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] is to burn all the places he didn't go to as a child. He successfully destroys his first two targets, but Batman captures him at the site of his third, the Gotham Zoo. He is one of the main villains in part 1, but is captured. He has been locked up so long he has been mostly forgotten about. 

In a recent attempt to burn Gotham to the ground, Firefly is horribly burned when the chemical factory he targeted explodes. He suffers burns over 90 percent of his body, and is ultimately sentenced to [[Blackgate Prison]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He makes a short appearance in the [[Justice League|JLA]] story arc "Crisis Of Conscience"<ref>''JLA'' #115-#119</ref> fighting [[Catwoman]] in Gotham City over a [[diamond]] before Batman arrives. Although an epic battle between the [[Secret Society]] and the Justice League ensues, Firefly is knocked out and remains unconscious during the entire battle. He makes another short appearance in the 2005 mini series ''[[Villains United]]'', when the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempts to escape the Society's grasp.

Firefly is among the numerous heroes and villains apparently murdered by the [[OMACs]] in the pages of DC's ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', although he later appears alive in ''[[Villains United|Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special]]'' and ''[[Gotham Underground]]''.

Firefly appears with Mr. Freeze facing the [[Batman]] (though Firefly is wearing the same uniform as the Firefly design of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'').<ref>''[[Superman/Batman]]'' Annual #3</ref>

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Firefly was with Cheetah III's [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] was created. He was defeated by Wonder Woman alongside [[Shrapnel (DC Comics)|Shrapnel]], [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]], and [[T. O. Morrow|T.O. Morrow]].

Firefly is recruited by a new Black Mask to a part of a group of villains that aiming to take over Gotham, but he follows his own agenda. Inspired on the chemicals that Black Mask used on him, Firefly inserts chips in Gothamites in order to make them burn.<ref>"Batman - Streets of Gotham #1"</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In his Pre-Crisis appearances, Firefly utilizes tricks using colored lights in his crimes.

In his Post-Crisis appearances, Firefly is an expert in pyrotechnics and explosives. He has thorough knowledge of inflammable agents. His suit contains a flamethrower, grenade launchers, and an extensive arsenal of fire-creating weapons.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Firefly was voiced by [[Mark Rolston]]. In "Torch Song", this version, Garfield Lynns is a [[pyrotechnics]] engineer who kidnaps his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Cassidy, who had fired and dumped him after he botched a pyrotechnics display at one of her concerts. Although Batgirl rescues Cassidy, Lynns escapes and creates the armor that enables him to become Firefly. He smokes out the building Cassidy and her crew are in, enabling him to make off with Cassidy. Batman defeats Firefly and rescues Cassidy, but she develops [[pyrophobia]]. Firefly also appears in the episode "Legends of the Dark Knight" in which he has been hired to burn down a building so that its owner could collect the insurance. A group of children stumble across his plans, yet Batman saves them and defeats Firefly.

* It is revealed by the producers in an article about ''The New Batman Adventures'' in ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' #172 that they had been forbidden by the network to use him or any other [[pyromaniac]] character in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' while it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].

* Firefly later reappears on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' in the episode "Only a Dream" with Mark Rolston reprising his role. He is one of the villains (besides [[Volcana (DC Comics)|Volcana]], [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]) sprung from prison. He and Volcana are apprehended by [[Green Lantern]].

* Firefly appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Jason Marsden]], which is perhaps his best-known appearance. In the series, he first appeared in "The Big Heat" as a [[mercenary]] and arsonist for hire. His weapons and paraphernalia include a heat ray, a battle suit, and a jetpack (which sounds like a fly when it is used). He was hired by GothCorp to attack it's rivals only to be defeated by Batman who left evidence that exposed Firefly's connection to GothCorp. He has appeared in the episodes "Fire and Ice" where he teamed up with [[Mr. Freeze]]. He joined Team Penguin in the episode "Team Penguin" along with [[Killer Croc]], [[Killer Moth]] and [[Ragdoll (comics)|Ragdoll]]. In "White Heat", Firefly gains a new partner and lover named Dr. Jane "Blaze" Blazedale and they both steal a [[phosphorus]] [[isotope]] to upgrade his battle suit. An accident causes the isotope to mutate Firefly into [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]] who acquires greater powers, but is also driven insane soon after his transformation.

* Firefly appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. This version is based on the Pre-Crisis version of Firefly. In "A Bat Divided", He was seen at a bar where the bad guys hang out until [[Firestorm (Jason Rusch)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up. In "Emperor Joker," Firefly uses his light powers to cause Batman problems and create his Rainbow Creature. Batman uses his rainbow costumes to defeat him.
