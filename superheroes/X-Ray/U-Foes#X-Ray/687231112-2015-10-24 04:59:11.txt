The '''U-Foes''' are a fictional [[comic book]] supervillain team appearing in various series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The group consists of four members: '''Vector''', the group's leader who can repel matter [[psychokinesis|telekinetically]]; '''Vapor''', who can transform into any form of gaseous matter; '''X-Ray''', who can generate and project radiation and fly; and '''Ironclad''', who can transform into any metal form and control his density. They first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #254 (December 1980). As noted on the first page of that issue, the group's name was inspired by the 1979 [[Graham Parker]] song "Waiting for the UFOs".<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date = 2008|page = 199|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Inspired by the 1979 Graham Parker song ''Waiting for the UFOs'', the creation of the U-Foes was truly a team effort.

==Fictional team biography==
Simon Utrecht, a former politician and multi-millionaire, funds an operation to gain superpowers the same way the [[Fantastic Four]] had, by flying into space and being exposed to cosmic rays. He chooses three other members to join him: Ann Darnell, Jimmy Darnell, and Mike Steel. What the group did not know was that they would be exposed to much higher amount than the Fantastic Four and that it would most likely kill them. The Hulk, in his Bruce Banner form, brings the ship down by reprogramming their computer before the group was exposed to the terminal levels of cosmic rays. The group did manage to gain powers and the newly christened U-Foes attacked Banner for interfering, convinced they could have become even more powerful without his intervention. Banner transforms into the Hulk and a fight ensues, but the U-Foes lose due to their inexperience with their newly gained powers and inability to fight as a team.  Sometime later they escape from jail, and X-ray discoveres a way to keep Bruce Banner in his human form by generating 'anti-gamma rays'. Hulk is freed by his allies and defeats the team.

After several defeats at the hands of the Hulk and his allies, each of the U-Foes are banished to a different dimension.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #304-305 (Feb.-March 1985)</ref>  They manage to reunite and find their way back to Earth when the mutant [[Portal (comics)|Portal]]'s powers began manifesting.  The U-Foes attempt to murder Portal to keep him from opening another portal to banish them, but are defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  They later attempt to kidnap Portal to exploit his mutant powers, and are defeated once again by [[Captain America]], [[Darkhawk]], and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the team generally work alone, but occasionally work as hired hands for other villains.  Working for the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], they attack the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], injuring dozens of civilians.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397</ref> Despite the handicap of an orphan girl who had gotten mixed up in the battle, the Hulk and the Pantheon soldiers manage to subdue some of the U-Foes. The villains are tricked into hurting each other.  During the Acts of Vengeance, the U-Foes face the West Coast Avengers with the help of the Mole Man, but they are defeated.

Around this time, they play an important part in [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]] prison breakout in "[[Venom (comics)|Venom]] Deathrap; The Vault". The various U-Foes work together and with other villains to fight against the prison's security, its forces, [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The U-Foes and other prisoners are neutralized by technological mind-control.

The team later encounters the Hulk in the Arctic ice fields outside the Leader's devastated sanctuary for cancer victims. The Hulk, believing he had just lost his friend, intimidates them into fleeing.

Both of the fights with the Hulk are part of manipulations by the Pantheon's ancient leader, [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]]. Neither side realizes the old man is secretly a power-crazed murderous psychotic who enjoys manipulation.

Later, the U-Foes are again part of a breakout from the Vault. During this, they manage to destroy the entire facility.

The U-Foes also are freed from the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]], when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] breaks them out in the ''New Avengers'',<ref>''New Avengers vol. 1 #01''</ref> but are distracted from escaping by a confrontation with [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and his team of mind-controllers—including [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Mister Fear]], [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]] and the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]]—over technology that had been stolen from them, until [[Spider-Man]], Captain America and Iron Man are able to capture them.

===Civil War===

The U.S. sends the B-Squad version of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] ([[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]], [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]], Fixer and [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]]), after the U-Foes. After a battle in Portland, the U-Foes are arrested.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104</ref> Instead of [[due process]], they are given the choice of joining the team or facing jail time.

The U-Foes are among the villains recruited to join [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate.<ref>''New Avengers'' #32 - 37 (2007)</ref> In ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #25, The U-Foes are seen to be among the new recruits for [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]].

===Dark Reign===

They help the other Initiative teams to defeat and capture the Heavy Hitters' leader, [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref>

===Siege===
The U-Foes play a role in the beginning of ''Siege'', when Norman Osborn sends them to fight [[Volstagg]]. The resulting clash leads to Volstagg being (falsely) blamed for destroying [[Soldier Field]] and killing thousands, and giving Osborn the excuse to start his war with Asgard.<ref>''Siege #1''</ref> With the help of other villains, they bring down Thor after he is attacked by [[Sentry (comics)|the Sentry]]. Osborn defeated, the whole team surrenders and is then incarcerated.

The U-Foes' powers are increased by Gamma Boosters made by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. In the end, they are defeated along with the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] and [[Zzzax]] when Black Panther destroys the generator.

===Video games===
* The U-Foes appear in ''[[The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga]]''.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/incredible-hulk-the-pantheon-saga The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga for DOS (1997) - MobyGames]</ref>

* The U-Foes appear in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' with Vector voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]], Vapor voiced by [[Rachael MacFarlane]], X-Ray voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]], and Ironclad voiced by [[Mitch Lewis]]. While Ironclad and Vapor appear virtually identical to their comic book incarnations, X-Ray is presented as glowing green with a silhouette of his skeletal structure visible through his flesh, and Vector retains a normal human appearance rather than being physically transformed. In this version, their original intention was to duplicate the accident that created the Hulk using atmospheric rather than gamma radiation. Their rage is subsequently directed at the Hulk due to him destroying the antenna that was gathering the radiation. The U-Foes attack the Hulk, but he defeats all of them. After the Hulk leaves the area, the U-Foes recover and decide if Hulk interferes with them again, they will kill him. The U-Foes would often appear in different parts of the city causing havoc. Ironclad can also be used as a playable character in the game if one of the U-Foes (Vector, X-Ray, Vapor) is used against the other.

* The U-Foes are featured in the [[Playdom]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'' as recurring bosses.
