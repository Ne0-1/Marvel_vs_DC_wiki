'''U-Foes''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] supervillain team that gained their superpowers by taking a cue from the [[Fantastic Four]] and going up into outer space, and getting hit by cosmic rays.  The supervillains battled [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and were a frequent threat to the [[The Incredible Hulk]] due to Bruce Banner having brought their ship down while it was exposed to the rays, as they believe they could have gained more power without Banner's interference. The group first appeared in ''Incredible Hulk'' (1st series) #254 (December 1980).

Throughout the [[1980s]] - [[1990s]] the team generally worked alone, but occasionally were hired hands for other villains such as the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. They were last seen in ''[[Spider-Man]]: Breakout.'' All members were later shown apprehended in the pages of "''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]''". The U-Foes were forced to join the Thunderbolts or they would have faced jail time as a part of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].
