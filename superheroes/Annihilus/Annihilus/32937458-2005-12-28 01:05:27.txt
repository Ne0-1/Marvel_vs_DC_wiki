'''Annihilus''', sometimes called the Living Death That Walks, is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]].  He was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #6 (1968).

==Character biography==
Annihilus an opponent of the [[Fantastic Four]], who lives in the [[Negative Zone]] (another dimension) where he is monarch. Annihilus is an enemy of [[Blastaar]], another enemy of the Fantastic Four. He is a member of an insectoid race and possesses alien technology far in advance to what is encountered on Earth. He is armed with a unique and powerful weapon, the Cosmic Control Rod. [[Mister Fantastic]] once travelled to the Negative Zone and took the Cosmic Control Rod to save the life of his unborn son, [[Franklin Richards]].  

Annihilus has survived certain death on numerous occasions; while his body has been destroyed, he has been reborn again from within his original body into a smaller weaker state, one which quickly grows into his former self, complete with a new cosmic control rod.

On another trip to the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Annihilus was again killed, this time by Hellscout, a member of a group of pilgrims who had been sent to the Negative Zone on their crossing to America from England. The pilgrims had him confused for a demon because of his appearance. He was in an extremely weakened state and appeared to be near the end of his life when this occurred. Annihilus reappeared in the 2005 comics mini-series ''Fantastic Four: Foes'' with a duplicate who he was fighting for control of the Negative Zone.

In the ''Blink'' limited series, Annihilus became involved in a brief romantic relationship with the [[Age of Apocalypse]] version of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]. This was presumably the Age of Apocalypse Annihilus from an alternate dimension.

==Powers and abilities==
Annihilus is capable of self propelled flight. He can withstand the vacuum of space. He wears armor that grants him resistance to most forms of injury (extreme temperatures, ballistic force, bullets, etc.) His armor is actually an insectoid exoskeleton with some armor components. He is superhumanly strong; the upward limit of what he can lift is just under 50 tons.

Annihilus wields the Cosmic Control Rod, a weapon of great power. It allows him to manipulate cosmic energy in order to manipulate the molecular structure of matter. The rod is capable of projecting destructive energy of up to 10 megatons of TNT. Continuous exposure to the cosmic energies of the rod has also retarded the aging process of its wielder.

Though Annihilus has knowledge of technology centuries beyond what is known on Earth, his intelligence is only above average compared to normal humans; he is not an original thinker.
