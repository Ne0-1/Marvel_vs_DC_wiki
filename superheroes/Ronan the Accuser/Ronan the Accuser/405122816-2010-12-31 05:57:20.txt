==Fictional character biography==
Ronan the Accuser was born on the planet Hala, the Pama system, part of the Kree Empire in the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]]. Ronan is a member of the alien [[Kree]] race and the "Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire." 

Ronan, like all Kree, is oblivious to the existence of Earth until one of their robotic servants, a [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] is defeated by the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Traveling to Earth to pass judgment on the heroes for their arrogance and punish them, Ronan himself is defeated, which prompts a new interest in Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #64 - 65</ref> A Kree expedition is sent to Earth, and includes the hero Captain [[Mar-Vell]], who liaises with Ronan on several occasions.<ref>The expedition arrives in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #12 (Dec. 1967)</ref>

===Kree-Skrull War===
{{Main|Kree-Skrull War}}
Ronan is next seen in the Kree-Skrull War, and it is revealed that he secretly plans with [[Zarek (comics)|Zarek]] to overthrow the Kree leader, the [[Supreme Intelligence]], believing the Empire should not be ruled by a non-humanoid entity. Ronan is paralyzed by the psionic powers of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and control of the Kree Empire reverts back to the Supreme Intelligence.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #16; ''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #88 - 97</ref> 

After the Kree defeat in the War, Ronan is mentally dominated by the Supreme Intelligence, and battles Mar-Vell.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #41</ref> Ronan decides to end the meta-human threat from Earth by reversing evolution. Despite being aided by the [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] and a troop of Kree, Ronan is defeated by Mar-Vell, and loses his sanity.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 1) #47 - 49</ref> Ronan's sanity is later restored by the Supreme Intelligence. He battles [[Ms. Marvel]] and Captain Mar-Vell, and returns to his former position as Supreme Accuser.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #19</ref>

Ronan later plays a pivotal role in the second Kree-Skrull War, and is ordered by Kree empress Nenora to execute the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' (vol. 3) #13</ref> Instead, Ronan executes a [[Skrull]] duplicate of the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #14</ref>

===Kree-Shi'ar War===
{{Main|Operation: Galactic Storm}}
Ronan reappears during the Kree-[[Shi'ar]] War when the one group from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] arrives at the Kree homeworld and the Accusers take them into custody.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} When the Supreme Intelligence makes his play for power, Ronan is one of the characters who joins [[Starforce (comics)|Starforce]], who come under Shi'ar after the near-destruction of the Kree.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

===Annihilation===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] storyline, Ronan is accused of treason. While trying to clear his name Ronan battles the female assassin [[Gamora]] and discovers he has been framed by a highly-placed member of a Kree house. Ronan then returns to help defend the Kree Empire against the [[Annihilation Wave]], and joins the [[United Front (comics)|United Front]] led by the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]. In this series he serves as an [[anti-hero]]. Ronan later clears his name and kills his betrayer, although not before his accuser lobotomizes the Supreme Intelligence. In an act of mercy Ronan kills the Supreme Intelligence, and becomes ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #1 - 4 (2006)</ref>

The weakened Kree are then attacked and assimilated by the alien species the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], with Ronan currently forced to serve them to protect the Empire.<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Wraith'' #1 (2007)</ref> The Wraith managed to free him. Along with the Wraith, Kl'rt the Super-Skrull, Praxagora and Ra'venn, Ronan headed for the former Kree capital of Kree-Lar, which is among the ceded territories given to the N-Zone forces under Ravenous. However, though his intentions were to form an alliance, his real motives were to reactivate 15,000 Kree Sentries right underneath Ravenous' palace. Originally, the Sentries were made to eventually take back the Kree territories from the N-Zone bugs. But now, Ronan intends to use them to annihilate Hala off the face of the universe as a mercy killing to his people. With the Wraith and Praxagora rendering the Sentries immune to the Phalanx, Ronan had them set off for Hala. Even though the coalition of heroes including Nova and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] were making a fighting stand to defeat the Phalanx, Ronan refused to relent on the attack. The robot Ultron, who was the mastermind behind the Phalanx invasion, took control of Praxagora and through her, the Sentries, using them to create a gigantic body for himself. Ronan and company barely survived when Praxagora destroyed herself. After Wraith and Quasar defeated Ultron, rendering the Phalanx harmless, Ronan is left to pick up the pieces of the Kree empire.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

To bring their two races closer together, Ronan and Crystal's marriage proceeds. However, Crystal sees the marriage as a political affair, much to Ronan's disappointment (he had brought her flowers, ostensibly to try and woo her).<ref>''War of Kings'' #1</ref> On the wedding day, he was severely beaten by the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] and hospitalized. Crystal then visits him before leading an attack on the Shi'ar.<ref>''War of Kings'' #2</ref>

He was mentioned to be connected to the "Skrull" plan in "My Neighbor Was A Skrull" where Skrull agents disguised themselves as humans to gain tissue samples of the Fantastic Four, for unknown reasons. In "Revenge of the Skrulls," he was mentioned to have been removed from the Kree Empire following the last encounter. He teams up with Commander Kl'rt (who used the tissue samples to become Super-Skrull) in his revenge on Human Torch. Both were defeated by the Fantastic Four, but escaped.
