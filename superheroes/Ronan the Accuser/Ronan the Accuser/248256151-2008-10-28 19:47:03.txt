==Fictional character biography==
Ronan the Accuser is a member of the alien race the [[Kree]] and the "Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire." Ronan, like all Kree, is oblivious to the existence of Earth until one of their robotic servants, a [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] is defeated by the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Travelling to Earth to pass judgement on the heroes for their arrogance, Ronan himself is defeated, which prompts a new interest in Earth. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #64 - 65</ref> A Kree expedition is sent to Earth, and includes the hero Captain [[Mar-vell]], who liaises with Ronan on several occasions. <ref> The expedition arrives in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #12 (Dec. 1967)</ref> Ronan is next seen in the [[Kree-Skrull War]], and it is revealed that he secretly plans to overthrow the Kree leader, the [[Supreme Intelligence]], believing the Empire should not be ruled by a non-humanoid entity. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #88 - 97</ref> 

After the Kree defeat in the War, Ronan decides to end the meta-human threat from Earth by reversing evolution. Despite being aided by the [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] and a troop of Kree, Ronan is defeated by Mar-vell. <ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1, #47 - 49</ref>
