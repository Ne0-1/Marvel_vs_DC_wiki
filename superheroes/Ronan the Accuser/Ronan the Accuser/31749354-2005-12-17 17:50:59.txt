'''Ronan the Accuser''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] alien [[supervillain]]. He first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #65, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Character==
Ronan the Accuser is a member of the [[Kree]] [[aristocracy]], who can trace their ancestry back to the original Kree tribes on the planet '''Hala'''. Upon the completion of his formal education, he was enrolled in the '''Kree Public Accuser Corps'''. Ronan responded well, and was steadily promoted. Finally, in a border incident, he stopped a fleet of [[Skrull]] ships from entering Kree space. For this, he was made '''Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire''', responsible for enforcing the laws and decrees of the [[Supreme Intelligence|Kree Supreme Intelligence]]. His duties often brought him in conflict with a number of Earth superheroes; notably the Fantastic Four. 

Ronan made his first appearance when the Fantastic Four had taken a vacation on T-Vu island in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. They were attacked by the Kree Sentry 459, who had been left on the island thousands of years ago. The Sentry's last instructions was to keep all intruders off the island until his Kree masters told him different. The FF destroyed the Sentry, and when the Supreme Intelligence got word, they sent the team a dream where the were to await trial and execution by Ronan. Ronan attacked the FF, but was defeated.

As a blue Kree with strong racial pride, Ronan resented taking orders from a mere computer (the Kree Supreme Intelligence). He instigated a civil war, but was defeated.

In the aftermath of the [[Kree-Shi'ar War]], Ronan began searching for ways to restore the Kree to glory, from convincing the [[Inhumans]] to fight for him, to trying to steal the Kree Psyche-Magnetron from the Watcher. All these schemes ended in failure.

During the Maximum Security storyline in [[2000]], Ronan was revealed to have been working for the Supreme Intelligence since the Kree-Shi'ar war. He eventually achieved his dream of greatness, and became the bearer of the power of [[Ego the Living Planet]]. However, he was defeated. His current whereabouts are unknown.

==Kree Public Accusers==
The Kree Public Accusers are the pre-eminent law-enforcement body in Kree Space. It is made up entirely of blue-skinned Kree, and follows the harsh Kree penal code, which allows death, [[exile]] and [[brainwashing]] as punishments.

All Public Accusers carry a '''cosmi-rod''', a hammer-shaped weapon, of which the most powerful is the Ultimate Weapon, which is carried by the Kree Supreme Accuser. In addition, the Accuser wear powered armor, which increases their strength six-fold, and grants them certain abilities, such as heat-vision.

As if this were not enough, the Accusers are backed up by the Kree Sentrys, an armada of living [[robots]]. The Sentrys are active in duties considered too menial or long for an Accuser(for example, a Sentry is required to check on the Inhumans every 10,000 years to examine their progress). All Sentrys are giant, with superhuman abilities, such as force-field projection, energy blasts, flight, and superhuman strength.
