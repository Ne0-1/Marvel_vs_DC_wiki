==Fictional character biography==
{{recentism|date=August 2014}}
Ronan was born on the planet Hala, the capital of the Kree Empire in the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]]. Ronan is a member of the alien [[Kree]] race and a member of the Accuser Corps, who are the Kree equivalent of military governors and jurists.  His rise through the ranks was extraordinary, and he eventually became the third-most powerful being in the Kree Empire.  The [[Supreme Intelligence]] appointed him "Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire", and in this role he is known simply as "Ronan ''the'' Accuser".

Ronan is sent to Earth to investigate the defeat of the robotic [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry-459]] by the [[Fantastic Four]]. The team defeats Ronan,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol. 1) #64 - 65</ref> which prompts a Kree expedition to spy on and assess Earth.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #12 (Dec. 1967)</ref> [[Captain Mar-Vell]] is a member of the team and he interacts with Ronan frequently during his mission.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol 1 #7, #12</ref>

Ronan secretly plans with [[Zarek (comics)|Zarek]] to overthrow the Kree leader, the [[Supreme Intelligence]], believing the Empire should not be ruled by a non-humanoid entity. Ronan is paralyzed by the psionic powers of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and control of the Kree Empire reverts to the Supreme Intelligence.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #16; ''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #88 - 97</ref>

Ronan is mentally dominated by the Supreme Intelligence, and battles Mar-Vell on multiple occasions.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #41, 47-49</ref> Ronan later regains his sanity and returns to his former position as Supreme Accuser.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #19</ref> During the second Kree-Skrull war, Ronan executes a [[Skrull]] duplicate of the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #14</ref>

During the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree-Shi'ar War]], Ronan joins [[Starforce (comics)|Starforce]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol 1 #342</ref>

When Earth becomes a [[Maximum Security (comics)|prison planet]], Ronan serves as the warden of the planet, apparently subordinate to the Shi'ar, but this is revealed to be part of an elaborate trap by the Supreme Intelligence to subvert the galactic council and use [[Ego the Living Planet]] as a weapon.{{issue|date=May 2013}} Although Ronan is able to elevate his power by tapping into Ego's own energy, [[Mister Fantastic]], Iron Man, [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]] and [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] manage to devise a machine that transfers Ego's essence into [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. The weakened Ronan is defeated and captured by the [[U.S. Agent]].{{issue|date=May 2013}}

When Ronan is falsely accused of treason by [[Tana Nile]], he discovers he has been framed by a highly placed member of a Kree house.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #1 - 4 (2006)</ref> After defending the Kree Empire against the [[Annihilation Wave]], Ronan  clears his name and kills his betrayer, although not before his accuser lobotomizes the Supreme Intelligence. In an act of mercy, Ronan kills the Supreme Intelligence and becomes ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref>''Annihilation'' #1-6 (2006)</ref>

During the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] [[Annihilation: Conquest|conquest of the Kree]], Ronan works with the [[Super-Skrull]] and [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]] to free his people.

When the [[Inhumans]] seek aid from the Kree against the Skrull's [[Secret Invasion]], Ronan agrees on the condition that the Inhuman princess, [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], become his bride.<ref>''Secret Invasion: [[Inhumans]]'' #3-4</ref> On their wedding day, he is severely beaten by the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] and hospitalized.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1 (2009)</ref> He does not fully recover until after the [[War of Kings]] is over.{{issue|date=July 2014}}

During the [[The Thanos Imperative|war with the cancerverse]], Ronan is a member of [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova's]] main attack force.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #4</ref> In an effort to prevent further massive conflicts, Ronan joins the [[Annihilators]].<ref>''The Thanos Imperative: Devastation'' one-shot (2011)</ref> They protect [[Spaceknights|Galador]] from the [[Dire Wraiths]]<ref>''Annihilators'' #1-4 (2011)</ref> and oppose the [[Universal Church of Truth]]'s attempt to revive the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]].<ref>''Annihilators: Earthfall'' #1-4 (Sept-Dec 2011)</ref>

Ronan the Accuser is separated from his wife [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] under the orders of [[Black Bolt]]. This separation is part of a truce that was made between Black Bolt and the [[Supreme Intelligence]] to ensure peace between Inhumans and the Kree Empire. Crystal and Ronan are deeply saddened by this decision, as their arranged marriage had eventually become a stronger relationship.<ref>''FF'' 20-21</ref>

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Ronan the Accuser and the Supreme Intelligence appeared as members of the Galactic Council.<ref>''Infinity'' #3</ref> Ronan later fights Thanos' minion [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Black Dwarf]] of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] and kills him.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #23</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ronan has superhuman strength, endurance, speed and reflexes, which are enhanced by devices in his suit of full-body exoskeleton armor. Ronan's armor can also create fields of invisibility, and his gauntlets can generate sufficient coldness to place certain life forms into a state of suspended animation. Ronan possesses a weapon called the "Universal Weapon". At its wielder's will, this device uses cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including the disintegration, rearrangement, or transmutation of matter; projection of concussive energy blasts; absorption of energy; control over gravity; creation of force fields and "time-motion displacement fields"; and interstellar teleportation along hyperspatial passages. Ronan is a highly skilled soldier and a military genius with Kree military combat training. He also possesses exhaustive knowledge of the legal code of the Kree Empire.

Ronan forges an alliance with [[Thanos]], described in the film as "the most powerful being in the universe": in exchange for a mysterious "orb" that Thanos desires, Thanos agrees to destroy Xandar for Ronan. Ronan recovers the orb, only to find that it contains an ancient, powerful object known as an [[Infinity Gems#Film|Infinity Stone]]. Ronan taunts Thanos with the discovery, asking Thanos what use Ronan has for him now that Ronan holds the power of the stone. Setting the stone within his war hammer, Ronan becomes an unstoppable force. As Ronan's [[flagship]] descends on Xandar, the Nova Corps attempts to prevent Ronan from reaching the planet's surface. Ronan uses his new-found power to decimate their forces. As Ronan attempts to strike his hammer against the surface of Xandar to destroy it completely, [[Star-Lord]] distracts him while the other Guardians assemble a weapon to separate the stone from Ronan. Ronan is defeated when the Guardians of the Galaxy use the stone to destroy him.
