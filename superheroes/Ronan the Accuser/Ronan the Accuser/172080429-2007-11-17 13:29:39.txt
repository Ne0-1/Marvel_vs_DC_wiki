Ronan the Accuser is a member of the alien race the [[Kree]] and the "Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire." Ronan, like all Kree, is oblivious to the existence of Earth until one of their robotic servants, a [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] is defeated by the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]]. Travelling to Earth to pass judgement on the heroes for their arrogance, Ronan himself is defeated, which prompts a new interest in Earth. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #64 - 65</ref> A Kree expedition is sent to Earth, and includes the hero Captain [[Mar-vell]], who liaises with Ronan on several occasions. <ref> The expedition arrives in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #12 (Dec. 1967)</ref> Ronan is next seen in the [[Kree-Skrull War]], and it is revealed that he secretly plans to overthrow the Kree leader, the [[Supreme Intelligence]], believing the Empire should not be ruled by a non-human entity. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #88 - 97</ref> 

After the Kree defeat in the War, Ronan decides to end the meta-human threat from Earth by reversing evolution. Despite being aided by the [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] and a troop of Kree, Ronan is defeated by Mar-vell. <ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1, #47 - 49</ref>

During the recent [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] incident, Ronan is accused of treason.

Ronan then returns to help defend the Kree Empire against the [[Annihilation Wave]], and joins the [[United Front (comics)|United Front]] led by the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]. Ronan later clears his name and kills his betrayer, although not before his accuser lobotomises the Supreme Intelligence. In an act of mercy Ronan kills the Supreme Intelligence, and becomes ruler of the Kree Empire. <ref>''Annihilation:Ronan'' #1 - 4 (2006)</ref>
