'''Firelord''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].  He was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[John Buscema]], and is most closely associated with Marvel's ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' and ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' comic series.

==Character Biography==
===Origin===
Pyreus Kril is a graduate of the Xandarian Nova Corps, an interstellar police force. During his commission, he served aboard a Xandarian ship under the command of Gabriel Lan. Gabriel and Pyreus became good friends during their tour and Pyreus was extremely upset at Gabriel's abduction by the Planet Devourer [[Galactus]]. Pyreus assumed command and proceeded to search for Gabriel. By the time Pyreus caught up to Galactus, Gabriel had already been killed (only to be resurrected as the Herald [[Air-Walker]]). Galactus only told Pyreus Gabriel's fate after Pyreus agreed to serve him. Pyreus agreed, and became "Firelord," Galactus' newest [[Galactus's Heralds|Herald]]. He served Galactus for a time until he became restless and asked for his freedom. Galactus agreed, on condition that he found another herald. Firelord travelled to Earth and was offered the lifeless [[Destroyer (Thor character)|Destroyer]] by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to give Galactus. Galactus accepted, and Firelord was freed. Since then, Firelord has been an occasional ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] as well as companion to the resurrected [[Air-Walker]].

===Annihilation===
:''Main article: [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]''
In the Marvel ''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' mini-series, Firelord loses his friend [[Air-Walker]], who is hunted down by [[Annihilus]]'s Seekers. Firelord is not present for this battle, but later rescues the Silver Surfer from the Seekers alongside fellow Herald [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]]. The Heralds band toghether to defend a refugee fleet as the Silver Surfer is replaced by the Herald [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]] to the dismay of Firelord. The three heralds band together and eventually join [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'s United Front against the [[Annihilation Wave]]. Firelord sacrifices himself to capture one of Annihilus' Queens during a battle and is believed to be half-dead and half alive while in the care of the United Front's medical unit. In ''Annihilation'' #3, Firelord recovers long enough to intervene in a battle between Ravenous and [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] within the infirmary ward. As the building crashes down around them, the [[Super-Skrull]] (once thought dead) emerges from the rubble with the unconcious bodies of both Ronan and Firelord.  The story is on-going.

==Powers and abilities==
Firelord possesses the Power Cosmic, which manifests itself in the form of cosmic flames surrounding his body. The most common manifestation of these powers is the ability to generate and control flames via his staff. He is capable of interstellar travel under his own power and is immune to the hazards of space. He has super strength, does not require food, water, or air to survive, and is nearly invulnerable.
