'''Firelord''' ('''Pyreus Kril''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].  He was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[John Buscema]], and is most closely associated with Marvel's ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' and ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' comic series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
[[Image:Firelord-headshot.jpg|thumb|left|Firelord pictured in his classic look. Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]
Pyreus Kril is a graduate of the Nova Corps, the military and exploratory force of the planet Xandar. During his commission, he served aboard a Xandarian ship under the command of Gabriel Lan. Gabriel and Pyreus became good friends during their tour and Pyreus was extremely upset at Gabriel's abduction by the Planet Devourer [[Galactus]]. Pyreus assumed command and proceeded to search for Gabriel. By the time Pyreus caught up to Galactus, Gabriel had already been killed (only to be resurrected as the Herald [[Air-Walker]]). Galactus only told Pyreus Gabriel's fate after Pyreus agreed to serve him. Pyreus agreed, and became "Firelord," Galactus' newest [[Galactus's Heralds|Herald]]. He served Galactus for a time until he became restless and asked for his freedom. Galactus agreed, on condition that he found another herald. Firelord travelled to Earth and was offered the lifeless [[Destroyer (Thor character)|Destroyer]] by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to give Galactus. Galactus accepted, and Firelord was freed. Since then, Firelord has been an occasional ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] as well as companion to the resurrected [[Air-Walker]]. He would help the Surfer hunt down and rescue a lost, confused and mistreated [[Frankie Raye|Nova]]. It can also be noted that on a visit to earth after leaving Galactus, Firelord fought and was defeated by Spider-man.

===Annihilation===
{{main|Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation}}
In the Marvel ''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' mini-series, Firelord loses his friend [[Air-Walker]], who is hunted down by [[Annihilus]]' Seekers. Firelord is not present for this battle, but later rescues the Silver Surfer from the Seekers alongside fellow Herald [[Red Shift (comics)|Red Shift]]. The Heralds band toghether to defend a refugee fleet as the Silver Surfer is replaced by the Herald [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]] to the dismay of Firelord. The three heralds band together and eventually join [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'s United Front against the [[Annihilation Wave]]. Firelord sacrifices himself to capture one of Annihilus' Queens during a battle and is believed to be half-dead and half alive while in the care of the United Front's medical unit. In ''Annihilation'' #3, Firelord recovers long enough to intervene in a battle between Ravenous and [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] within the infirmary ward. As the building crashes down around them, the [[Super-Skrull]] (once thought dead) emerges from the rubble with the unconscious bodies of both Ronan and Firelord. After Annihilus is defeated by Nova and his compatriots in ''Annihilation'' #6, Firelord sets out on a quest for vengeance against the Centurians, the strike force that destroyed his homeworld at the start of the Annihilation Wave.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===

In the 31st century of [[Earth-691]], Firelord is a friend and an ally to the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. He aids them in battle against the Stark and later becomes a member of The Galactic Guardians. He is known as "Protector of the Universe", but does not wear the [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum bands|Quantum bands]], which are in the possession of the Silver Surfer in this timeline.

Firelord, at one time, teams up with the Surfer of this timeline to battle Galactus, who was threatening Earth once again. Along with Dargo, the current wielder of the Thor power, they send a combined blast at the planet-devourer. Nova intercepts this and is killed. The confrontation delays the two from saving the Surfer's planet, [[Zenn-La]], from destruction.

Later, Firelord would team up with other heroes, including [[Martinex]], [[Replica (comics)|Replica]] and [[Wonder Man|Hollywood]] to combat various threats endangering an innocent planet of civilians. The heroes involved would form the [[Galactic Guardians]].

===Heroes Reborn===

Firelord serves as part of a large team of Heralds, all serving Galactus. They include Air-Walker and [[Terrax]]. He is seen checking out a distant planet, where one of Galactus' 'seeds', intended to cause life to flourish and ready planets for consumption, has failed. His work is interrupted by Galactus himself, who wants him to join with the others. Firelord feels guilt over his duties but recalls that he made a bargain with Galactus, he would serve him in exchange for sparing his planet. 

Firelord, Galactus and the other heralds are seen in statue form in the Inhuman's city of Attilan.

===Marvel Zombies 2===

Promotional images reveal that a zombiefied Firelord will appear in the sequel to [[Marvel Zombies]]. In a preview it is revealed that he is missing his lower jaw, making it impossible for him to talk (but apparently eating isn't a problem).

==Powers and abilities==

Firelord possesses the [[Herald of Galactus#Powers of heralds|Power Cosmic]] which enables him to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of stellar fire. His entire organic carbon-based body was transformed to accommodate the nuclear energies that course through him. These energies make him the humanoid equivalent of a miniature sun. Projected from any point on his body at mental command, Firelords energies encompass the entire electromagnetic spectrum possessed by a star: heat, light, gravity, radio waves, and charged particles. The maximum amount of energy he can produce at once is determined by his mass. When all the atoms of his body are in fusion, his energy level is equivalent to the outer layers of a small star. By the slightest manifestation of his stellar powers, he can burn through any Earthly substance (with the exception of Adamantium). He can project a stream of fire resembling a solar flare for distances measured in the hundreds of miles. Firelord can control the path of his cosmic fire to such an extent that he can project a sustained ring at a fixed distance around a person or object

By utilizing his cosmic power uni-directionally. Firelord can fly at near-light speeds through interstellar space. (Flying at such speeds near planetary bodies, however, could cause devastating gravitational disturbances.) Firelord can even traverse hyperspace without danger to himself. Firelord uses the gravitational fields of stars to help him break his speed.

Although Firelord still possesses a solid physical body, he is virtually impervious to most forms of physical harm. His body automatically incinerates any projectile before it reaches the surface of his "skin." He is immune to disease, aging, and muscle fatigue. He no longer needs to eat since his body takes its nourishment from the carbon-carbon cycle of solar fusion. He no longer needs to breathe air and hence can exist indefinitely in the hard vacuum of space.
