:''"Firelord" is the name of a hero in patch 1.17 of ''[[Warcraft III]]: [[The_Frozen_Throne|Warcraft 3: TFT]]''.''

'''Firelord''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]] most closely intertwined with the comic series ''[[Thor (comics)|Thor]]'' and ''[[Silver Surfer]]''.  Originally a starship captin named Pyreus Kril, he possesses the Cosmic Power, which manifests itself in the form of a cosmic flame about his person. The most common manifestation of these powers is the ability to generate and control flame via his staff. He is capable of interstellar travel under his own power and is immune to the hazards of space. He is superhumanly strong and durable; during one notable battle with [[Spider-Man]], Firelord withstood Spider-Man's continued blows for several hours before finally falling.

Pyreus Kril was a graduate of the Xandarian Nova Corps, an interstellar police force.  He was serving aboard a Xandarian ship under the command of Gabriel Lann, who would later became the [[Air-Walker]] after being abducted by [[Galactus]]. Gabriel and Pyreus had become very good friends during their tour and Pyreus was extremely upset at Gabriel's abduction. Pyreus was second in command and proceeded to look for Gabriel to find out what exactly happened to him. By the time Pyreus caught up with Galactus, Gabriel had already been killed. Galactus would only tell Pyreus Gabriel's fate after Pyreus agreed to serve him for a time. Pyreus agreed, and became Firelord, Galactus' newest [[Galactus's Heralds|Herald]]. He served Galactus for a time until he became restless and asked for his freedom. Galactus agreed if he could find him another herald. Firelord then went to earth and Thor offered him the lifeless [[Destroyer (comics)|Destroyer]] to give Galactus. Galactus accepted, and Firelord was freed. Since then, Firelord has been an occasional ally of Thor and the Silver Surfer and companion to the resurrected Air-Walker.
