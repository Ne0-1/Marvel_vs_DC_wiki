'''Artemis of Bana-Mighdall''' is a fictional [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[superheroine]] created by writer [[William Messner-Loebs]], appearing in [[DC Comics]] [[comic book]]s. Artemis first appeared in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' #90 (September 1994).

==History of the character==
===Amazon tribe background===
As described in her comic book appearances, Artemis was born an Amazon as a member of the Egyptian tribe of [[Bana-Mighdall]], who migrated from [[Greece]] to various [[Europe|European]] and [[Middle East|Middle Eastern]] countries before finally settling in [[Egypt]]. Three thousand years ago, the two Amazon Queens ([[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]]) split the Amazon nation in two. Hippolyta's tribe traveled to the isolated island of [[Themyscira]] (otherwise known as Paradise Island) to live immortal lives in order to protect the doorway to the Underworld called Doom's Doorway. Antiope's tribe was never given immortality and was forced to mate with common men in order to guarantee their tribe's survival. As they had renounced their [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian gods]] once the two Queens parted ways, they eventually began to assimilate various religions and goddesses from the many lands they traveled to. Some of those included the goddesses [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], [[Mamitu|Mammitu]], [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]], [[Neith]] and [[Ishtar]]. It was in Egypt that they finally built the city of [[Bana-Mighdall]], which in their language translates to "''The Temple of Women''". Thanking the Amazons for their worship, one of their new goddesses created a powerfully consistent sandstorm to surround and protect their city from any outsiders who could not be trusted, or "ariandas". The Bana-Mighdallian Amazons eventually began an uneasy trade with outside cities in order to create commerce. They would exchange custom-made weapons and their warrior skills for goods and slaves for breeding.

===Modern times===
Over the centuries the Bana-Mighdallian weapons and services became above par and were in much demand. This way of living continued until the late 20th century. It was into this period that Artemis was born. Eventually the Amazon Princess Diana of Themyscira, or [[Wonder Woman]], found their city while searching for the villain [[Cheetah (comics)|The Cheetah]], who had stolen her golden [[Lasso of Truth]]. As the Bana-Mighdallian language had changed so much over time to incorporate middle eastern dialect, Diana had a hard time communicating with the newly-found Amazons. Eventually a battle took place between her and the Bana-Mighdallian's chief warrior or [[Shim'Tar]]. Soon an enraged Olympian god [[Hermes]], who was in love with Diana, took vengeance on the desert Amazons for attacking his beloved, and the city of Bana-Mighdall was destroyed. Homeless, the remaining Amazons eventually took up with the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] who was a nemesis of Wonder Woman. It was agreed that in exchange for their servitude during the events of the [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]] Circe would grant them immortality and a new home to call their own. It was decided that since the Themyscirian princess was the initial cause of their city being destroyed, they would take over her Amazon city instead. Though only 14 years of age at this time, Artemis spoke before the Queen and Council to protest the planned attack as she felt that Amazons must not war against each other. Her cries were ignored and the attack was undertaken. 

[[Image:ArtemisCampFire.jpg|thumb|Artemis fireside discussing her past. Art by [[Mike Deodato]]]]During the attack on Themyscira the witch Circe showed her true colors and teleported the island into a dimension of [[demon]]s in order for both tribes to be destroyed. The two tribes put aside their rivalry temporarily and fought the demons in order to ensure the Amazon survival. Though only a few months passed in the real world, the time the Amazons spent in the demon dimension lasted 10 years. Discovering that Circe had made her island home disappear, Wonder Woman forced her to return it to its rightful place. Once this was done Wonder Woman learned about the invasion and the demon war. She eventually met Artemis who was now in her mid-20s. The two got off to a rocky start but Diana could see that Artemis' heart was true.

===Wonder Woman===
Due to being in the demon dimension, Queen Hippolyta began to see visions of the future. One of those visions included Wonder Woman dying. Keeping this to herself, she called for a new Contest for the title of Wonder Woman. Initially excluding the new Amazons, Queen Hippolyta submitted to a vote on the whole to include them at Diana's behest. Through some mystical managing on Hippolyta's part, Artemis eventually won the Contest and became the new Wonder Woman. As gifts to aid her in her new mission, Artemis was given several mystical objects. The Gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] which increased its wearer's strength by 10 times, The Sandals of [[Hermes]] which gave the gift of speed and flight, and the golden [[Lasso of Truth]] which forced anyone tied by it to speak only truth. Although Artemis tried diligently to distinguish herself from her predecessor, this proved to be rather hard to do. Her approach to various situations was often seen as more violent than beneficial. Because of this, and due to Man's World's respect of Diana, Artemis often would receive the cold shoulder from those she tried to help, extending even to her brief time in the [[Justice League]]. A comment was once made that [[Batman]] refused to allow Artemis to even sit in "Diana's" chair during JLA meetings. She later met a representative from a public relations company who agreed to help Artemis with her public likeability. What Artemis wasn't aware of was that the company had staged several false battles for her that ultimately helped downtrodden groups such as immigrant workers and abused women. Once she uncovered this truth she set about to prove herself by single-handedly taking down [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]'s biggest mob families. Artemis' arrogance eventually gained the better of her, and she died in a battle with [[White Magician|The White Magician]]. Thus, Queen Hippolyta's vision of Wonder Woman dying came true.

===Requiem===
[[Image:WW123.jpg|thumb|left|Artemis battles Diana as Requiem. Cover art by: [[Mike Deodato]]]]For some reason, after her death, Artemis' soul ended up in [[Tartarus]] and there she became a figurative bride to one of the thirteen ruling Princes of [[Hell]] named Dalkriig-Hath. Eventually Artemis was able to kill Dalkriig-Hath and regain access to the world of the living. Wanting to separate herself from her former title as Wonder Woman, Artemis used her skills learned in [[Tartarus]] to her advantage and joined a group of demon hunting heroes called the Hellenders. While there she was assigned the codename Javelin, which she quickly rejected for the name Requiem. Artemis developed a romantic interest in fellow Hellender Sure-Shot, a master of arsenal and projection weapons. This interest was dropped though when she discovered that Sure-Shot's perceived self-assurredness was brought on by [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic drugs]] which were meant to keep various Hellender members fearless while battling the likes of demons and ghouls. She also befriended a woman by the name of Henrietta Jessup, who went by the codename Sojourner. Though Sojourner didn't have any warrior skills to speak of, Artemis stood by her friend and tutored her as a novice Amazon. This teacher/mentor relationship was later expanded as Wonder Woman asked Artemis to take on a new pupil, that of [[Cassandra Sandsmark]] who had become the new [[Wonder Girl]]. Taking Cassandra as a full-time student, Artemis became a reserve member of the Hellenders leaving Sojouner to take her place as a full-time member. Later still, Artemis' teacher/mentor resume would expand even more to even include the combat training of [[Kara Zor-El|Supergirl]]. It was during the initial meeting of Supergirl that Artemis would gain her revenge against Batman for his hostile attitude towards her when she attempted to join the JLA. Artemis bested Batman in hand-to-hand combat but was eventually subdued with a tranquilizer dart.

The underworld demon Belyllioth, who served as master over some of the [[Myrmidons|Myrmidon]] demons, later contacted Artemis to inform her of an unrest in Tartarus. With the death of the demon Dalkriig-Hath, the remaining twelve princes of hell were battling for dominion over the dead demon's realm. As Dalkriig-Hath's widow, Artemis was by rights next in line to rule his region of Hades. Artemis ended the demonic war by presenting herself before the twelve demon rulers to officially be granted her former husband's station. After the blessing ceremony was given Artemis revealed that the blessing was actually given to Belyllioth, who was magically disguised in Artemis' form. Angered by her deception, the twelve princes of hell vowed vengeance against Artemis upon her return to Hades. Fortunately for Artemis, her devoted friend Belyllioth (now officially one of the thirteen rulers of Tartarus) has sworn her allegiance and protection to the Amazon for eternity.

===Shim'Tar===
After some time Artemis returned to Themyscira to aid her Amazon sisters in the uneasy living conditions they continued to work in due to lingering animosities between the two tribes. Civil war incited by the Amazon sorceress Magala eventually broke out between the two groups of Amazons, leaving Artemis to take up the title of her tribe's chief warrior, or [[Shim'Tar]]. She did this in the hopes of ending the war and to guide both tribes to peaceful negotiations. As Shim'Tar Artemis battled Queen Hippolyta, who was acting as the newest Wonder Woman. During their battle Artemis reminded Hippolyta that the Themyscirian queen wasn't given the armor of Wonder Woman out of honor, but rather as a punishment for causing the death of not only Artemis but of her daughter Diana as well. Ultimately coming to her senses, Hippolyta finally forgave the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall for their previous transgressions and joined her daughter Diana on the battlefield. Together Queen Hippolyta and Princess Diana renounced their crowns, leaving the island without a structured government in the hopes of ending the needless slaughter brought on by the war. They were successful and Artemis and the Themyscirian General Phillipus were later voted to be co-rulers of the island.

===Themyscira's disappearance===
Due to the [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] attack on Themyscira during the [[Infinite Crisis]] events (as well as the many previous attacks against the island since Diana had become Wonder Woman) it was decided by Artemis and Phillipus that the entire island of Themyscira and all of its inhabitants (sans Diana) would be transported to a hidden location via the Olympian and Bana-Mighdallian goddesses. Presumably, it is here that Artemis continues to live and guide the Amazons to a better way of life. Whether she and the other Amazons will ever be seen again remains to be seen.

==Comic Book Inspiration==
Artemis was inspired by the creation of 2 other comic book characters:
*[[Wildcats (comics)|Wildcats]] member '''[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]]''', a [[Kherubim]] and a [[Coda (Wildstorm)|Coda]] warrior. Zealot is the former Majestrix of the all female warriors called The Coda and helped develop their virtues and practices. She has lived for thousands of years and has had many relationships with both humans and aliens alike. After failing to follow her own rules under the Coda, she left their clan and they have hunted her since. Zealot has a close friendship with [[Grifter]] though she is equally devoted to her sister [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]], who is secretly her real daughter. Artemis matches Zealot's physical appearance exactly, outside of having red hair.

*The Amazon '''[[Orana]]''' from the [[Wonder Woman]] comics, Vol. 1, issue 250 (December 1978) and issue 251 (January 1979). In this story, the Amazon Orana challenged Diana to a tournament to claim the title of Wonder Woman. She was successful but her arrogance brought about her death shortly into her reign. Like Artemis, Orana was a fiery red-head Amazon who died as Wonder Woman. It has been suggested that Artemis is actually the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] version of Orana.

==Trivia==
* Although Artemis is an Amazon of Bana-Mighdall since birth, her given name is a mystery as the Bana-Mighdallians forsook the Olympian gods millennia ago. One theory fans have come up with is that Artemis' birth mother may have died during childbirth. Naming the surviving child ''Artemis'' could be an ironic call to the goddess [[Artemis]] for yet again failing the Amazons, as one of the goddess' many responsibilities includes being the goddess of mid-wives and childbirth.
* During [[John Byrne]]'s time on the Wonder Woman comic, he insinuated that Artemis previously had an affair with the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]]. This falls out of established history as in the ''Requiem'' mini-series Artemis admits to being a virgin. Also, prior to Artemis' return from the demon dimension at the age of 24, the only other time Artemis would have had to even have met Kanto would have been between infancy to 14 years of age. Thus she would have been much too young to have had a relationship with the grown adult.
* During [[Greg Rucka]]'s tenure on the Wonder Woman comic he stated on his personal [http://www.comicbloc.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=60 comic book message board] that the DC editors approached him with the idea of getting rid of the goddess Artemis during his run as audiences may be confused with the two characters of the same name. Greg followed through with the suggestion despite the fact that the two characters have existed in the same title with little confusion for 10 years prior.
* After Artemis' death as Wonder Woman, her soul was sent to a form of hell as shown in the ''Requiem'' mini-series.  A crucifix topped tombstone is also depicted as marking Artemis' grave in Boston. This is probably an error or oversight, as Artemis' belief system is that of the ancient Egyptians and various other middle-eastern religions. As such her soul would not go to a christian version of hell and a crucifix would not be on her headstone. Also, her place of burial would more likely be on Themyscira with her people and not an outworld city among strangers.
