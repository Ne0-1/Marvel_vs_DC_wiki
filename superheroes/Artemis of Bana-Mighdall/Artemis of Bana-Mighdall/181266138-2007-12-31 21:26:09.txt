'''Artemis of Bana-Mighdall''' is a fictional [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[superheroine]] created by writer [[William Messner-Loebs]], appearing in [[DC Comics]] [[comic book]]s. Artemis first appeared in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' v2 #90 (September 1994).

==History of the character==
===Amazon tribe background===
As described in her comic book appearances, Artemis was born an [[Amazons (comics)|Amazon]] as a member of the Egyptian tribe of [[Bana-Mighdall]], who migrated from [[Greece]] to various [[Europe]]an and [[Middle East]]ern countries before finally settling in [[Egypt]].<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #33</ref> Three thousand years ago, the two Amazon Queens ([[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]]) split the Amazon nation in two. Hippolyta's tribe traveled to the isolated island of [[Themyscira]] (otherwise known as Paradise Island) to live immortal lives in order to protect the doorway to the Underworld called Doom's Doorway. Antiope's tribe was never given immortality and was forced to mate with common men in order to guarantee their tribe's survival. As they had renounced their [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian gods]] once the two Queens parted ways, they eventually began to assimilate various religions and goddesses from the many lands they traveled to. Some of those included the goddesses [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], [[Mamitu|Mammitu]], [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]], [[Neith]] and [[Ishtar]]. It was in Egypt that they finally built the city of [[Bana-Mighdall]], which in their language translates to "''The Temple of Women''". Thanking the Amazons for their worship, one of their new goddesses created a powerfully consistent sandstorm to surround and protect their city from any outsiders who could not be trusted, or "ariandas". The Bana-Mighdallian Amazons eventually began an uneasy trade with outside cities in order to create commerce. They would exchange custom-made weapons and their warrior skills for goods and slaves for breeding.

===Enter: Artemis===
Over the centuries the Bana-Mighdallian weapons and services became above par and were in much demand. This way of living continued until the late 20th century. It was into this period that Artemis was born. So far there has been no mention of who gave birth to Artemis or any other blood relative within the tribe. Still, although Artemis is an Amazon of Bana-Mighdall since birth, her given name is a mystery as the Bana-Mighdallians forsook the Olympian gods millennia ago. One theory fans have come up with is that Artemis's birth mother may have died during childbirth. Naming the surviving child ''Artemis'' could be an ironic call to the goddess [[Artemis]] for yet again failing the Amazons, as one of the goddess's many responsibilities includes being the goddess of midwives and childbirth.

Eventually the Amazon Princess Diana of Themyscira, or [[Wonder Woman]], found their city while searching for the villain [[Cheetah (comics)|The Cheetah]], who had stolen her golden [[Lasso of Truth]].<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #29</ref> As the Bana-Mighdallian's original Themyscirian language had changed over time to incorporate middle eastern dialect, Diana had a hard time communicating with the newly-found Amazons. Eventually a battle took place between her and the Bana-Mighdallian's chief warrior or [[Shim'Tar]]. Soon an enraged Olympian god [[Hermes]], who was in love with Diana, took vengeance on the desert Amazons for attacking his beloved, and the city of Bana-Mighdall was destroyed.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #35</ref> Homeless, the remaining Amazons eventually took up with the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] who was a nemesis of Wonder Woman.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #56</ref> It was agreed that in exchange for their servitude during the events of the [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]] Circe would grant them immortality and a new home to call their own.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #90</ref> It was decided that since the Themyscirian princess was the initial cause of their city being destroyed, they would take over her Amazon city instead. Though only 14 years of age at this time, Artemis spoke before the Queen and Council to protest the planned attack as she felt that Amazons must not war against each other.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #0</ref> Her cries were ignored and the attack was undertaken.

===Amazons united===
[[Image:ArtemisCampFire.jpg|thumb|Artemis fireside discussing her past. Art by [[Mike Deodato]]]]During the attack on Themyscira the witch Circe showed her true colors and teleported the island into a dimension of [[demon]]s in order for both tribes to be destroyed.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #90</ref> The two tribes put aside their rivalry temporarily and fought the demons in order to ensure the Amazon survival. Though only a few months passed in the real world, the time the Amazons spent in the demon dimension lasted 10 years. Discovering that Circe had made her island home disappear, Wonder Woman forced her to return it to its rightful place.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #89</ref> Once this was done Wonder Woman learned about the invasion, the demon war, and the Amazon truce. She eventually met Artemis who was now in her mid-20s. The two got off to a rocky start but Diana could see that Artemis' heart was true.

===Wonder Woman===
Due to being in the demon dimension, Queen Hippolyta began to see visions of the future. One of those visions included Wonder Woman dying. Keeping this to herself, she called for a new Contest for the title of Wonder Woman. Initially excluding the new Amazons, Queen Hippolyta submitted to a vote on the whole to include them at Diana's behest. Through some mystical managing on Hippolyta's part, Artemis eventually won the Contest and became the new Wonder Woman.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #92</ref> As gifts to aid her in her new mission, Artemis was given several magical objects. The Gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] which increased its wearer's strength by 10 times, The Sandals of [[Hermes]] which gave the gift of speed and flight, and the golden [[Lasso of Truth]] which forced anyone tied by it to speak only truth. Although Artemis tried diligently to distinguish herself from her predecessor, this proved to be rather hard to do. Her approach to various situations was often seen as more violent than beneficial. Because of this, and due to Man's World's respect of Diana, Artemis often would receive the cold shoulder from those she tried to help, extending even to her brief time in the [[Justice League]].<ref>Justice League America #97, 98, 100</ref> A comment was once made that [[Batman]] refused to allow Artemis to even sit in "Diana's" chair during JLA meetings.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #226</ref> She later met a representative from a public relations company who agreed to help Artemis with her public likeability. What Artemis wasn't aware of was that the company had staged several false battles for her that ultimately helped downtrodden groups such as immigrant workers and abused women.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #98</ref> Once she uncovered this truth she set about to prove herself by single-handedly taking down [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]'s biggest mob families. Artemis' arrogance eventually gained the better of her, and she died in a battle with [[White Magician|The White Magician]].<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #100</ref> Thus, Queen Hippolyta's vision of Wonder Woman dying came true.

===Requiem===
After Artemis's death as Wonder Woman, her soul was sent to a form of [[Tartarus|hell]] as shown in the ''Requiem'' mini-series. A crucifix-topped tombstone was depicted as marking Artemis's grave in Boston. This is probably an error or an oversight, as Artemis's belief system is that of the ancient Egyptians and various other middle-eastern religions. As such, her soul would not go to a Christian version of Hell and a crucifix would not be on her headstone. Also, her place of burial would more likely be on Themyscira with her people and not an outworld city among strangers.

[[Image:WW123.jpg|thumb|left|Artemis battles Diana as Requiem. Cover art by: [[Mike Deodato]]]]While in the underworld Artemis became a figurative bride to one of the thirteen ruling Princes of [[Hell]] named Dalkriig-Hath.<ref>Requiem:Artemis series</ref> Eventually Artemis was able to kill Dalkriig-Hath and regain access to the world of the living. Wanting to separate herself from her former title as Wonder Woman, Artemis used her skills learned in [[Tartarus]] to her advantage and joined a group of demon hunting heroes called the Hellenders. While there she was assigned the codename Javelin, which she quickly rejected for the name Requiem. Artemis developed a romantic interest in fellow Hellender Sure-Shot, a master of arsenal and projection weapons. This interest was dropped though when she discovered that Sure-Shot's perceived self-assuredness was brought on by [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic drugs]] which were meant to keep various Hellender members fearless while battling the likes of demons and ghouls. She also befriended a woman by the name of Henrietta Jessup, who went by the codename Sojourner. Though Sojourner didn't have any warrior skills to speak of, Artemis stood by her friend and tutored her as a novice Amazon. This teacher/mentor relationship was later expanded as Wonder Woman asked Artemis to take on a new pupil, that of [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie Sandsmark]] who had become the new [[Wonder Girl]].<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #142</ref> Taking Cassandra as a full-time student, Artemis became a reserve member of the Hellenders leaving Sojouner to take her place as a full-time member. Later still, Artemis' teacher/mentor resume would expand even more to even include the combat training of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].<ref>Superman/Batman #10</ref> It was during the initial meeting of Supergirl that Artemis would gain her revenge against Batman for his hostile attitude towards her when she attempted to join the JLA. Artemis bested Batman in hand-to-hand combat, but was eventually subdued with a tranquilizer dart.<ref>Superman/Batman #9</ref>

[[Image:Belyllioth.jpg|thumb|Artemis agrees to aid Belyllioth in the Underworld. Art by: [[Ed Benes]]]]
The underworld demon Belyllioth, who served as master over some of the [[Myrmidons|Myrmidon]] demons, later contacted Artemis to inform her of an unrest in Tartarus.<ref>Wonder Woman Annual Vol. 2 #6</ref> With the death of the demon Dalkriig-Hath, the remaining twelve princes of Hell were battling for dominion over the dead demon's realm. As Dalkriig-Hath's widow, Artemis was, by rights, next in line to rule his region of Hades. Artemis ended the demonic war by presenting herself before the twelve demon rulers to officially be granted her former husband's station. After the blessing ceremony was given, Artemis revealed that the blessing was actually given to Belyllioth, who was magically disguised in Artemis's form. Angered by her deception, the twelve princes of hell vowed vengeance against Artemis upon her return to Hades. Fortunately for Artemis, her devoted friend Belyllioth (now officially one of the thirteen rulers of Tartarus) has sworn her allegiance and protection to the Amazon for eternity.

During [[John Byrne]]'s time on the Wonder Woman comic, he insinuated that Artemis previously had an affair with the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]].<ref>Genesis mini-series (1997)</ref> This falls out of established history as no prior connection of Artemis or the Amazons to [[Apokolips]] had been established until [[Darkseid]]'s invasion of Themyscira shortly after Artemis' death. Because of this the only other time Artemis could have met Kanto would have been before the Banas invaded Paradise Island, leaving Artemis to be between infancy to fourteen years of age. Thus she would have been much too young to have had a relationship with the grown adult. Artemis also admitted in the Requiem series that she was still a virgin, further removing the Kanto/Artemis romance plot.

===Shim'Tar===
After some time, Artemis returned to Themyscira to aid her Amazon sisters in the uneasy living conditions they continued to work in due to lingering animosities between the two tribes. Civil war incited by the Amazon sorceress Magala eventually broke out between the two groups of Amazons, leaving Artemis to take up the title of her tribe's chief warrior, or [[Shim'Tar]].<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #169</ref> She did this in the hopes of ending the war and to guide both tribes to peaceful negotiations. As Shim'Tar, Artemis battled Queen Hippolyta, who was acting as the newest Wonder Woman. During their battle, Artemis reminded Hippolyta that the Themyscirian queen wasn't given the armor of Wonder Woman out of honor, but rather as a punishment for causing the death of not only Artemis, but of her daughter Diana as well. Ultimately coming to her senses, Hippolyta finally forgave the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall for their previous transgressions, and joined her daughter Diana on the battlefield. Together Queen Hippolyta and Princess Diana renounced their crowns, leaving the island without a structured government in the hopes of ending the needless slaughter brought on by the war. They were successful, and Artemis and the Themyscirian General Phillipus were later voted to be co-rulers of the island.

As co-ruler Artemis helped usher in a new age for the Amazons by inviting outworlders to commune on Themyscira. This included both Earth-bound peoples as well as alien races.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #177</ref> Together with her people, Artemis learned about advanced alien technology and new battle skills. Unfortunately not all those contacted met the invitation warmly. The U.S. government posted war ships along the U.S./Themyscira boarder. Later the American President called a meeting with Artemis, Phillipus and Diana. He informed them that the U.S. government would ease the blockade if the Amazons agreed to transfer [[blueprint]]s on how to create their own [[Purple Ray]]. The trio gave a firm "no" as an answer and tensions between the two nations remained.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #208</ref>

===Themyscira's disappearance===
Through the machinations of an [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] [[satellite]] called '''Brother Eye''', a military strike was made against Themyscira in an attempt at Amazon [[genocide]]. A large swarm of [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] units were sent to the island and began to attack the Amazons as part of the events of [[Infinite Crisis]].<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2, #223</ref> Because of this, as well as the many previous attacks against the island since Diana had become Wonder Woman, it was decided by Artemis and Phillipus that the entire island of Themyscira and all of its inhabitants (sans Diana) would be transported to a hidden dimension via the Olympian and Bana-Mighdallian goddesses.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 2 #224</ref> Artemis and the remaining Amazons thrive in this dimension for a year's time in peace.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 3 #7</ref>

The witch Circe later entered the Amazons' protected dimension and revived Queen Hippolyta from death.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 3 #8</ref> Circe informed the Amazons that Diana was being illegally detained by the U.S. government and tortured until she gave them the secrets of the [[Purple Ray]]. Because of this, the Amazons agreed to give Hippolyta her royal title back, and followed her instructions to invade [[Washington, D.C.]] which brought about the events of [[Amazons Attack]]. Artemis and Phillipus were assigned to oversee the battle, but soon lost faith in Hippolyta when they discovered some of her actions against Man's World proved to be less honorable. Due to their failure to follow-through in stopping Hippolyta during the war, a disguised [[Granny Goodness]] cursed all of the Amazons by erasing their memories and scattering them across the globe with false personas.<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 3 #11</ref> The last we see of Artemis, she is in civilian travel clothes near the [[Great Wall of China]].<ref>Wonder Woman Vol. 3 #12</ref>

===Toys===
* In March 2001 [[DC Direct]] created an action figure of Artemis as part of their ''Amazons and Adversaries'' line. She is depicted in a green and black uniform given to her during writer [[Eric Luke]]'s time on the Wonder Woman comic book.
* In 2007 an Artemis figure was produced for the popular [[HeroClix]] line of toys. She is depicted in the Wonder Woman uniform while in mid-flight shooting her bow and arrow.

==Comic Book Inspiration==
Artemis's name is an intentional reference to the [[syncretic]] identification of the Greek [[Artemis]] with the Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Editor [[Paul Kupperberg]] characterized the two Wonder Women, Artemis and Diana, as "two sides of the same coin." This is not the first time that that naming device was used in ''Wonder Woman'' comics.
*'''Artemis, the ancient Wonder Woman''' seen in [[Wonder Woman]] vol. 1, # 301-302 ([[Dan Mishkin]], writer), was a predecessor & [[typology (theology)|typology]] of Diana, set in ancient times. This character is not established as part of post-Crisis continuity.

Also, Artemis's appearance seems influenced by two other comic book characters:{{Fact|date=November 2007}}
*[[Wildcats (comics)|Wildcats]] member '''[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]]''', a [[Kherubim]] and a [[Coda (Wildstorm)|Coda]] warrior. Zealot is the immortal former Majestrix of the all female warriors called The Coda and helped develop their virtues and practices. After failing to follow her own rules under the Coda, she left their clan and they have hunted her since. Artemis's long hair flowing from a topknot evokes Zealot's appearance.

*The Amazon '''[[Orana]]''' from the [[Wonder Woman]] comics, Vol. 1, issue 250 (December 1978) and issue 251 (January 1979). In this story, the Amazon Orana challenged Diana to a tournament to claim the title of Wonder Woman. She was successful, but her arrogance brought about her death shortly into her reign. Like Artemis, Orana was a fiery redheaded Amazon who died as Wonder Woman. It has been suggested{{Fact|date=November 2007}} that Artemis is actually the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] version of Orana.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=November 2007}}
* During [[Greg Rucka]]'s tenure on the Wonder Woman comic he stated on his personal [http://www.comicbloc.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=60 comic book message board] that the DC editors approached him with the idea of getting rid of the goddess Artemis during his run, as audiences may be confused with the two characters of the same name. Greg followed through with the suggestion despite the fact that the two characters have existed in the same title with little confusion for ten years prior.
