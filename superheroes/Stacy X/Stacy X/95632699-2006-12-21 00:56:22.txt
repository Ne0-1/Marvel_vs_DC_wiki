'''Stacy X (Miranda Leevald)''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[prostitute]] who was briefly affiliated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #399 (November, [[2001]]) by [[Joe Casey]] and [[Tom Raney]].

==Character history==
She was originally called X-Stacy, as she could use her pheromone powers to induce bliss, but after repeated error, she became known as Stacy-X.

Stacy X had the mutant ability to exude [[pheromones]], which she could control to stimulate bodily functions, as to cause [[orgasms]] or [[vomiting]]. She first appeared as a member of the [[Nevada]] mutant [[brothel]], the [[X-Ranch]]. After the [[hate group]] the [[Church of Humanity]] destroyed the ranch, Stacy joined the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She did play a vital role in fighting [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]], using her powers to seduce him and releasing the other trapped X-Men, allowing them to defeat him. She also proved to be a highly skilled fighter, even giving Wolverine a proper [[workout]].Where she got this training is unknown, much like everything else about her past. At one point, her ear and a large piece of skin peeled off (much like with [[Husk (comics)|Husk]]) displaying a possible secondary mutation of snake-like [[scales]] covering her whole [[body]], or a possible shedding of her [[skin]]. This was never explored. 

Soon after being rescued by the [[X-Men]] from the X-Ranch, Stacy stayed at the Institute, but took some time off after "servicing" a special client in Chappaqua, NY. Wolverine tracked her down and fought with her, but soon the two came to an understanding. Whether Wolverine convinced Stacy to completely abandon her former profession is unknown, but Logan did talk Kurt out of whatever censure he was contemplating. It was known that Stacy continued to "work" for special clients even as she operated as a member of the X-Men. Furthermore, during her membership with the X-Men she tried to seduce members [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. 


Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magic, she is one of the many mutants to lose her powers in the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] crossover. While she was a prostitute when she had her powers, she never actually slept with anyone for money, relying on her pheromone powers. Since she lost her powers, this has apparently changed. 

==Other Media==
Stacy X was rumored to have been considered as a character in [[X-Men: The Last Stand]]. The concept photo is available [http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/2764.asp here].

==Powers and abilities==

Snake like, scaly skin that gives her an unknown degree of durability. Can control pheromones, producing physical reactions in anyone she touches. She is able to heal others by speeding up their healing process, and can increase their stamina so that they won't tire easily, giving her teammates rushes of adrenaline, and granting them light super strength.  

Stacy was an expert fighter, able to challenge even [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and defeat him while laughing. However, this skill appears to be learnt and not mutant in nature.
