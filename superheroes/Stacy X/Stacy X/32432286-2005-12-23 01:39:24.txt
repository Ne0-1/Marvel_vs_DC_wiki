'''Stacy X''' (Miranda Leevald) is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[prostitute]] who was briefly affiliated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #399 ([[2001]]) by [[Joe Casey]] and [[Tom Raney]].

Stacy X had the mutant ability to exude [[pheromones]], which she could control to stimulate bodily functions, as to cause orgasms or vomiting. She first appeared as a member of the [[Nevada]] mutant brothel, the X-Ranch. After the [[hate group]] the [[Church of Humanity]] destroyed the ranch, Stacy joined the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She has presumably returned to her former profession. 

Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magicks, she is one of the many mutants to lose her powers in the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] crossover.

==In other media==

She will appear in the upcoming ''[[X-Men 3 (film)|X-Men 3]]'' movie. [[Omahyra Mota]] will portray her.
