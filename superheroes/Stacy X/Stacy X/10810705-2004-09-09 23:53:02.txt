'''Stacy X''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Stacy is a [[mutant]] [[prostitute]] who was briefly affiliated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #399 ([[2001]]).

Stacy X had the mutant ability to control the [[pheromones]] of others, creating a greatly pleasurable experience or greatly sickening one. She first appeared as a member of the [[Nevada]] mutant brothel, the X-Ranch. After the [[hate group]] the [[Church of Humanity]] destroyed the ranch, Stacy joined the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She has presumably returned to her former profession.
