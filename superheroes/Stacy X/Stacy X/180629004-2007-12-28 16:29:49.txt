'''Stacy X''' ('''Miranda Leevald''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[prostitute]] who was briefly affiliated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #399 (November, [[2001]]) by [[Joe Casey]] and [[Tom Raney]].

==Fictional character biography==
She was originally called X-Stacy, as she could use her pheromone powers to induce bliss, but after repeated error, she became known as Stacy-X.

Stacy X had the mutant ability to exude [[pheromones]], which she could control to stimulate bodily sensations and functions, such as causing [[orgasms]] or [[vomiting]]. Her mutation also had a physical manifestation: at the age of sixteen Stacy's skin was replaced by patterned, snake-like scales. At one point her skin was shown shedding, much like a real snakes.

She first appeared as a member of the [[Nevada]] mutant [[brothel]], the [[X-Ranch]]. After the [[hate group]] the [[Church of Humanity]] destroyed the ranch, Stacy joined the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She did play a vital role in fighting [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]], using her powers to seduce him and releasing the other trapped X-Men, allowing them to defeat him. She also proved to be a highly skilled fighter, even giving Wolverine a proper [[workout]]. Where she got this training is unknown, much like everything else about her past.

Soon after being rescued by the [[X-Men]] from the X-Ranch, Stacy stayed at the Institute, but took some time off after "servicing" a special client in Chappaqua, NY. Wolverine tracked her down and fought with her, but soon the two came to an understanding. Whether Wolverine convinced Stacy to completely abandon her former profession is unknown, but Logan did talk Kurt out of whatever censure he was contemplating. It was known that Stacy continued to "work" for special clients even as she operated as a member of the X-Men. Furthermore, during her membership with the X-Men she tried to seduce members [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. 

At one point, Stacy works with a food magnate, who is very sick. She changes his body chemistry so that he will live out the rest of his short life without pain. 

Due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magic, she is one of the many mutants to lose her powers in the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] crossover. While she was a prostitute when she had her powers, she never actually slept with anyone for money, relying on her pheromone powers. Since she lost her powers, this has apparently changed.

She is currently a member of the reformed [[New Warriors]] under the codename Ripcord.  The circumstances of how she joined aren't completely known, but her attitude and statements show that she wanted to change her life, and going back to being a hero seems like the path she chose best to do it.  Besides being given artificial powers to replace what she lost, she apparently also has lost her leftover scaled skin.

==Powers and abilities==

Snake like, scaly skin that gives her an unknown degree of durability. Can control other's pheromones through fleshly contact, producing sensations and physical reactions in anyone she touches. She is able to heal others by speeding up their healing process, and can increase their stamina so that they won't tire easily, giving her teammates rushes of adrenaline.

Stacy was an expert fighter, able to challenge even [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and defeat him while laughing. However, this skill appears to be learned and not mutant in nature.

Since joining the New Warriors, as Ripcord, she has been given a special armor which has extendable, super strong, metal tentacles which extend from her wrist which she can use as weapons.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Stacy X===
Ultimate Stacy X is introduced in [[Ultimate X-Men]] #81 as the girlfriend of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)#Ultimate Mastermind|Mastermind]], and stays with him in the cell where he is currently impersonating [[Magneto (comics)#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]], replacing [[Mystique (comics)#Ultimate Mystique|Mystique]] (who was doing the same after he escaped during the events of the "Magnetic North" storyline).

==In other media==

Stacy X was considered as a character in [[X-Men: The Last Stand]]. The concept photo is available [http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/2764.asp here].
