'''Bug-Eyed Bandit''' is the name of two [[fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Bertram Larvan version of Bug-Eyed Bandit first appeared in ''[[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]'' #26 and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Gil Kane]].

The second version of Bug-Eyed Bandit first appeared in ''Justice League of America'' #43 and was created by [[Keith Giffen]], [[J. M. DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]], and [[Adam Hughes]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Bertram Larvan===
'''Bertram Larvan''' was an inventor who designed a mechanical insect to control insect pests. Unfortunately, he had no financial backing to support his invention. He resolved to steal money he needed for his invention. He later used his invention to steal more. Soon, he had an army of mechanical insects. Two of his many insects were stag beetles who could bite through steel and spiders with webs that could support the weight of a man. Bertram took the name of the '''Bug-Eyed Bandit'''. He was thwarted by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]].<ref>''Atom'' #26 (August–September 1966)</ref>

Later, he accidentally discovers Atom's identity of Ray Palmer and fought him on different occasions. When he was about to use an amnesiac gas he had invented on Atom, he accidentally uses it on himself. He remains in a state of amnesia for years. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', millions of Shadow Demons, servants of the [[Anti-Monitor]], attack the Earth. Bertram is one of the many casualties.<ref>"Crisis On Infinite Earths" (1985)</ref> Marv Wolfman has gone on record saying that he killed both the original Bug-Eyed Bandit and the [[Ten-Eyed Man]] because he “couldn’t be part of a company that would print [them].”

In Grant Morrison's [[Animal Man]] storyline "Deus Ex Machina", [[Psycho-Pirate]], while in [[Arkham Asylum]], recreated characters removed from continuity. The Bug-Eyed Bandit (or a Pre-Crisis version of him) was one of them. Presumably, this character vanished from existence when the Psycho-Pirate's episode of madness ended, along with his colleagues.<ref>"Animal Man" #18-26 (1989-1990)</ref>

A flashback concerning his death happens in '' Batman Villains Secret Files and Origins 2005''.

Bertram Larvan has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. He is revived as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>"Blackest Night" #4 (2010)</ref>

The second Bug-Eyed Bandit is first presented as such in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]''.<ref>''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #608 (November 2002)</ref> But his first appearances can be traced as far back as ''[[Justice League America]]'' #43 (1990), where a Bug-Eyed Bandit appeared even though the original was supposed to be dead at the time. The current one is the son of the original Bug-Eyed Bandit, but not very successful.

Bug-Eyed Bandit recently reappeared in ''[[Villains United]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. His current whereabouts are unknown.<ref>"Infinite Crisis" (2005)</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* A female character with similar powers named Sasha Woodman appeared in the episode "Drone" in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''. She was able to control bees and used them to attack opposing candidates for student president before Clark stopped him.
* The Bertram Larvan version of Bug-Eyed Bandit appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. This version possesses the ability to shrink down to the size of an insect. In "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure," he is shown fighting the [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Atom]] on [[Aquaman]]'s windshield in micro-size until Aquaman wipes them off with his windshield wipers. In "The Criss Cross Conspiracy," the shrunken [[Batman]] and Atom end up fighting Bug-Eyed Bandit and his robotic ants where the two gain the unlikely help from Aquaman.

* A female version of the Bug-Eyed Bandit appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode "All Star Team Up", portrayed by [[Emily Kinney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/02/09/emily-kinney-confirmed-as-the-bug-eyed-bandit-on-the-flash/|title=Emily Kinney Confirmed As The Bug-Eyed Bandit On The Flash|work=ComicBook.com|date=February 9, 2015|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref> '''Brie Larvan''' is a scientist armed with robotic bees that she controls remotely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/flash-emily-kinneys-supervillain-will-788398|title=Emily Kinney's Supervillain Will "Wreak Havoc on the World"|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 13, 2015|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref> She was fired from her position at Mercury Labs by [[Tina McGee]] when fellow scientists Lindsay Kang and Bill Carlisle discovered that Brie intended to weaponize her project rather than use it for agricultural purposes. Growing bitter at this, Brie planned her revenge on the three of them. She manages to kill Kang and Carlisle with robotic bees with stingers containing apitoxin, and she is nicknamed the "Bug-Eyed Bandit" by [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] and [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]. Brie's attempt to kill Tina McGee are thwarted when Palmer uses his exo-suit to lure the bees over water to disable their circuitry. With help from [[Felicity Smoak]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] then tracks Brie to her base and captures her.
* [[Emily Kinney]] reprises her role as Brie Larvan in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode "Beacon of Hope". Imprisoned in Iron Heights after fighting Flash, Brie uses her court-sanctioned computer time to change her prison release date to March 30, 2016. She has been diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on her spine, one which will render her paraplegic once it's removed. She takes Palmer Tech's board members hostage using improved robotic bee drones - ones that can adapt to attacks - to force Felicity Smoak to turn over schematics to the prototype microchip that allows Felicity to walk after being paralyzed herself. [[Green Arrow (Arrow)|Green Arrow]] and his team try to rescue the hostages, but one of the drones lodges itself inside his body and begins replicating itself, threatening to release dozens more drones. Palmer Tech employee [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Curtis Holt]] helps Team Arrow successfully destroy the mini-swarm, then devises a method to hack Larvan's remaining bees, commanding them to sting her. The overdose of apitoxin from the stings leaves Brie in a coma. Although Brie's actions were criminal, it changes Felicity's perspective of how Palmer Tech should be used to change people's lives for the better rather than just being a corporate entity chasing profit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/recap/arrow-season-4-episode-17|title='Arrow' recap: Star City is abuzz with a returning threat|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>
