'''Bertram Larvan''' was an inventor who designed a mechanical insect to control insect pests. Unfortunately, he had no financial backing to support his invention. He resolved to steal money he needed for his invention. He later used his invention to steal more. Soon, he had an army of mechanical insects. Two of his many insects were stag beetles who could bite through steel and spiders with webs that could support the weight of a man. Bertram took the name of the '''Bug-Eyed Bandit'''. He was thwarted by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]].<ref>''Atom'' #26 (August–September 1966)</ref>

Later, he accidentally discovers Atom's identity of Ray Palmer and fought him on different occasions. When he was about to use an amnesiac gas he had invented on Atom, he accidentally uses it on himself. He remains in a state of amnesia for years. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', millions of Shadow Demons, servants of the [[Anti-Monitor]], attack the Earth. Bertram is one of the many casualties.<ref>"Crisis On Infinite Earths" (1985)</ref> Marv Wolfman has gone on record saying that he killed both the original Bug-Eyed Bandit and the [[Ten-Eyed Man]] because he “couldn’t be part of a company that would print [them].”

In Grant Morrison's [[Animal Man]] storyline "Deus Ex Machina", Psycho-Pirate, while in Arkham Asylum, recreated characters removed from continuity. The Bug-Eyed Bandit (or a Pre-Crisis version of him) was one of them. Presumably, this character vanished from existence when the Psycho-Pirate's episode of madness ended, along with his colleagues.<ref>"Animal Man" #18-26 (1989-1990)</ref>

A flashback concerning his death happens in '' Batman Villains Secret Files and Origins 2005''.

Bertram Larvan has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. He is revived as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>"Blackest Night" #4 (2010)</ref>

The second Bug-Eyed Bandit is first presented as such in [[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]].<ref>''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #608 (November 2002)</ref> But his first appearances can be traced as far back as ''[[Justice League America]]'' #43 (1990), where a Bug-Eyed Bandit appeared even though the original was supposed to be dead at the time. The current one is the son of the original Bug-Eyed Bandit, but not very successful.

He recently reappeared in ''[[Villains United]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. His current whereabouts are unknown.<ref>"Infinite Crisis" (2005)</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Bertram Larvan version of Bug-Eyed Bandit appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. This version possesses the ability to shrink down to the size of an insect. In "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure", he is shown fighting the [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Atom]] on [[Aquaman]]'s windshield in micro-size until Aquaman wipes them off with his windshield wipers. In "The Criss Cross Conspiracy", the shrunken [[Batman]] and Atom end up fighting Bug-Eyed Bandit and his robotic ants where the two gain the unlikely help from Aquaman.
