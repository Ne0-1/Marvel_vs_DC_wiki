===Bertram Larvan===

'''Bertram Larvan''' was an inventor who designed a mechanical insect to control insect pests. Unfortunately, he had no financial backing to support his invention. He resolved to steal money he needed for his invention. He later used his invention to steal more. Soon, he had an army of mechanical insects. Two of his many insects were stag beetles who could bite through steel and spiders with webs that could support the weight of a man. Bertram took the name of the '''Bug-Eyed Bandit'''. He was thwarted by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]].

Later, he accidentally discovers Atom's identity of Ray Palmer and fought him on different occasions. When he was about to use an amnesiac gas he had invented on Atom, he accidentally uses it on himself. He remains in a state of amnesia for years. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', millions of Shadow Demons, servants of the [[Anti-Monitor]], attack the Earth. Bertram is one of the many casualties. Marv Wolfman has gone on record saying that he killed both the original Bug-Eyed Bandit and the [[Ten-Eyed Man]] because he “couldn’t be part of a company that would print [them].”

A flashback concerning his death happens in '' Batman Villains Secret Files and Origins 2005''.

===Son of the Bug-Eyed Bandit===

The second Bug-Eyed Bandit is first presented as such in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #608 (November 2002). But his first appearances can be traced as far back as ''[[Justice League America]]'' #43 (1990), where a Bug-Eyed Bandit appeared even though the original was supposed to be dead at the time. The current one is the son of the original Bandit, but not very successful. He recently reappeared in ''[[Villains United]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as a member of the [[Society of Supervillains|Society]]. His current whereabouts are unknown.
