==Production==
[[File:Talbotgordon.JPG|thumb|left|Screen capture.]]
"As usual on a Katzman production," note Harmon and Glut, "the low budget showed everywhere in money-saving shortcuts, and inadequacies." The Batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the Robin costume added pink tights to cover the "hairy-legs" of both the actor and stuntman. The [[Batmobile]] is again excluded, but instead of a limousine, as in [[Batman (serial)|the first serial]], the duo drive around in a [[Mercury Eight|1949 Mercury]].<ref name="GMS">{{cite book

Several mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial. One example of this is that the film shows the [[Bat-Signal]] working in broad daylight. Another occurs when, despite the fact that the heroes' [[utility belt]]s had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls the nozzle and hose of an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxy-acetylene torch]] from his belt to cut through a steel door (the tanks for the torch are not shown); to compound this mistake, it is a full-sized oxy-acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person. Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch torch, as used in the comics, but the film-makers improvised in following the directions for a "blowtorch".<ref name="GMS" />
