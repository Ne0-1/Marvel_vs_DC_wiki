[[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] played [[Batman]], while [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]] played [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Supporting players included [[Poni Adams|Jane Adams]] as [[Vicki Vale]] and veteran character actor [[Lyle Talbot]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]].

==Plot==
The plot dealt with the Dynamic Duo facing off against the Wizard, a hooded villain whose identity remains a mystery throughout the serial until the end.

==Production==
"As usual on a Katzman production," note Harmon and Glut, "the low budget showed everywhere in money-saving shortcuts, and inadequacies." The Batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the Robin costume added pink tights to cover the "hairy-legs" of both the actor and stuntman. The [[Batmobile]] is again excluded, but instead of a limousine, as in the first serial, the duo drive around in a [[Mercury Eight|1949 Mercury]].<ref name="GMS">{{cite book

Several mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial. One example of this is that the film shows the [[Bat-Signal]] working in broad daylight. Another occurs when, despite the fact that the heroes' [[utility belt]]s had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls the nozzle and hose of a [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxy-acetylene torch]] from his belt to cut through a steel door. (The tanks for the torch are not shown.) To compound this mistake, it is a full-sized oxy-acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person. Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch torch, as used in the comics, but the film-makers improvised in following the directions for a "blowtorch".<ref name="GMS" />
