==Production==
"As usual on a Katzman production," note Harmon and Glut, "the low budget showed everywhere in money-saving shortcuts, and inadequacies."  The Batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the Robin costume added pink tights to cover the "hairy-legs" of both the actor and stuntman.  The [[Batmobile]] is again excluded, but instead of a limousine, as in the first serial, the duo drive around in a [[1949 Mercury]].<ref name="GMS">{{cite book

Several mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial.  One example of this is that the film shows the [[Batsignal]] working in broad daylight.  Another occurs despite the fact that the heroes' [[utility belt]]s had been replaced by normal belts for this serial, with no pockets or pouches.  Nevertheless, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls a [[blowtorch]] from his belt.  To compound this mistake, it is a full-sized blowtorch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person.  Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch blowtorch, as used in the comics, but the film-makers followed the directions for a "blowtorch" literally.<ref name="GMS" />

==Release==
===Home media===
The serial was released on [[DVD]] in 2005 to promote ''[[Batman Begins]]''.

==Critical reception==
Despite the significantly higher budget, it was deemed slightly inferior to the original 1943 serial. But nevertheless,  the acting was regarded as better than the first Batman serial. In particular, Lowery is regarded as being a much tougher Batman than his predecessor [[Lewis Wilson]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Chapter four is "one of the weirdest episodes" of the serial.  During this instalment, Batman spends half the chapter climbing a cliff while Robin pursues a speeding truck on foot.<ref name="GMS" />
