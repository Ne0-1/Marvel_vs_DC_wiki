It is a sequel to the [[Batman (serial)|1943 serial ''Batman'']], although with different actors. [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] played [[Batman]], while [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]] played [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

The serials were re-released as Video On Demand titles by [[Rifftrax]], the alumni project of former ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''  members Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. As of September 2014, they have released the entire serial series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rifftrax.com/search/apachesolr_search/batman|title=Search|publisher=}}</ref> [[Turner Classic Movies]] has broadcast the film serial from June to November 2015 in a weekly half-hour slot on Saturday mornings.

==Plot==
The Dynamic Duo face off against the Wizard, a hooded villain with an electrical device which controls cars and a desire to set challenges for the Dynamic Duo, whose identity remains a mystery throughout until the end.

==Cast==

==Production==
"As usual on a Katzman production," note Harmon and Glut, "the low budget showed everywhere in money-saving shortcuts, and inadequacies." The Batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the Robin costume added pink tights to cover the "hairy legs" of both the actor and the stuntman. The [[Batmobile]] is again excluded, but instead of a limousine as in [[Batman (serial)|the first serial]], the duo drive around in a [[Mercury Eight|1949 Mercury]].<ref name="GMS">{{cite book

Several mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial. One example is that the film shows the [[Bat-Signal]] working in broad daylight. Another occurs when, despite the fact that the heroes' [[utility belt]]s had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls the nozzle and hose of an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxy-acetylene torch]] from his belt to cut through a steel door (the tanks for the torch are not shown); to compound this mistake, it is a full-sized oxy-acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person. Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch torch, as used in the comics, but the film-makers improvised in following the directions for a "blowtorch."<ref name="GMS" />

==Release==
[[File:Batman&RobinSerialDVDCover.jpg|thumb|DVD cover]]
[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released the serial on [[DVD]] in 2005, timed to coincide with the theatrical release of ''[[Batman Begins]]''. Unlike [[Batman (serial)|its predecessor]], ''Batman and Robin: The Complete 1949 Movie Serial Collection'' has been given a restoration. In February 4, 2014, [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] released Gotham City Serials, a two-disc DVD set that includes both the 1943 Batman serial and the 1949 Batman and Robin Serial. [[Rifftrax]] released a Video On Demand of the first installment of the short on July 16, 2013, featuring a running mocking commentary from Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett of [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]] fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mst3kinfo.com/?p=16136#comments|title=New Short from RiffTrax… « Satellite News|publisher=}}</ref> The final episode, "Batman Victorious," was released with commentary on September 19, 2014.
