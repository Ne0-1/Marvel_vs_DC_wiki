'''Hector Hammond''' is a [[DC Universe]] [[supervillain]] who is primarily an enemy of [[Green Lantern]].  He was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]], and originally appeared as in ''Green Lantern (vol. 2)'' # 5 (March-April 1961).

== Character History ==

First appearing as a fugitive, he discovered a strange [[meteor]] whose radiation caused all the living things to evolve rapidly. After discovering this effect, Hammond decided to kidnap four [[scientist]]s and exposed them to the meteor to evolve their intellects while taking advantage of the fact that the effect also sapped their wills, making them easy to dominate. (''Interesting to note: Part of that meteor landed in Africa, which evolved the [[gorilla]]s inhabiting the area. One of these gorillas that was affected by the meteor is [[Grodd]].)

Hammond rapidly became a celebrity with revolutionary technology he claimed was his own invention.  [[Hal Jordan]] decided to investigate this man and why his skills suddenly mirrored the specialities of the missing scientists with his friend, [[Thomas Kalmaku]], agreeing to impersonate him, complete with a duplicate power ring to draw attention from Jordan.  Unaware of the impersonation, Hammond kidnapped Kalmaku, stole his ring and turned him into a chimpanzee.  This forced Jordan to confront Hammond personally in a destructive battle of power rings that ended only when Hammod's ring charge expired, allowing Jordan to capture him and restore Kalmaku and the scientists.

In the next major appearance, Hammond escaped prison and deliberately exposed himself to the [[meteorite]].  The result was his body shrunk while his head grew in size and gained formidable [[psionic]] powers and later became immortal as well.  However, these boons came at a price with his body becoming immobile.  While Hammond initially tried to cure his condition, he eventually abandoned that quest to keep his power.

In addition, Hammond was responsible for the creation of the second [[Royal Flush Gang]].

== Powers ==

Hammond in his mutated state exhibited genius level intellect, potent telepathic and telekinetic abilities, and on occasion displayed the ability to absorb and mentally redirect Green Lantern's emerald plasma.

==After Rebirth==
Hammond has reappeared now that Hal Jordan has returned as Green Lantern.
