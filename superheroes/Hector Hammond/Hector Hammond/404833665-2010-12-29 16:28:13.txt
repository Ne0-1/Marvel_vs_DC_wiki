==Fictional character biography==
Hammond is a petty criminal on the run from the law when he discovers the fragments of a strange [[meteor]] in the woods (later [[retcon]]ned as part of the same meteor that lands in Africa, super-evolving [[Gorilla Grodd]] and the other gorillas of [[Gorilla City]]).<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2 #69 (October 1992)</ref> Observing that radiation from the meteor has caused the nearby plants to evolve rapidly, Hammond decides to kidnap four scientists and expose them to the meteor. The radiation causes their intellects to evolve, but also has the side effect of sapping their wills. Hammond is able to force the scientists to use their heightened intellect to create amazing new inventions, which Hammond sells for his own profit.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Hammond rapidly becomes a rich celebrity due to the wealth he has acquired. [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]] asks his friend and mechanic, [[Thomas Kalmaku]], to take on the role of the Green Lantern while Jordan investigates Hammond. Jordan creates a duplicate power ring and costume for Kalmaku to fool Hammond. Unaware of the impersonation, Hammond kidnaps Kalmaku, steals his ring and turns him into a chimpanzee. Jordan confronts Hammond personally in a battle of power rings that ends only when the charge of Hammond's ring runs out, allowing Jordan to capture him and restore Kalmaku and the scientists.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Hammond returns in ''Justice League of America'' #14 (September 1962), where he has managed to escape from prison and deliberately exposes himself to the [[meteorite]]. The radiation causes his brain to grow to enormous size, granting him [[psionic]] powers as well as [[immortality]] in the process. Unfortunately, his body becomes immobilized and he loses the power to speak. Trapped in a motionless state, Hammond is still able to use his psionic powers to control the minds of others.<ref name="dc-ency"/> He attempts to steal the Green Lantern's ring, but Jordan manages to command his ring to drain itself of power when it leaves his finger, after which Jordan renders Hammond unconscious.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #25 (December 1963)</ref>

Hammond is responsible for the creation of the second [[Royal Flush Gang]] in ''Justice League of America'' #203 (June 1982).  Hammond and the Gang are defeated when Dr. Martin Stein, one half of the superhero [[Firestorm (Ronald Raymond)|Firestorm]], subdues Hector on the astral plane.

He was directly responsible for the neglect of the JLA in [[Justice Leagues]].<ref>Justice Leagues #1 (March 2001)</ref>

In addition to battling Hal Jordan, Hammond has also fought [[Alan Scott]]<ref>''Green Lantern Quarterly'' #2</ref> as well as [[Kyle Rayner]].<ref>''Green Lantern 80-Page Giant'' #2 (June 1999)</ref>

===Secret Origin===
He appears in the 2008 ''[[Green Lantern: Secret Origin]]'' (a re-telling of Hal Jordan's first days as a Green Lantern), where he claims to be [[Carol Ferris]]' boyfriend.<ref name="gl30">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #30 (April 2008)</ref> However in the next issue it is revealed that he is just a private consultant for Ferris Aircraft and that they had gone out to dinner, according to Carol, "on business".<ref name="gl31">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #31 (May 2008)</ref> While inspecting [[Abin Sur]]'s crashed aircraft, Hammond is affected by the meteorite fragment in its reactor. This leads to his brain growing bigger, and able to read minds, including Carol Ferris and [[Hal Jordan]] who Hammond deduces is the [[Green Lantern]].<ref name="gl32">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #32 (June 2008)</ref> His mental powers keep Hal from using his ring, and is only stopped when [[Sinestro]] encases his head in an energy bubble, cutting off his air supply.<ref name="gl33">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #33 (July 2008)</ref> It is revealed that Hammond wants the power of a god in order to gain revenge on Hal Jordan/Green Lantern.<ref name="gl35">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #35 (October 2008)</ref>

===After ''Green Lantern: Rebirth''===
Hammond has reappeared now that Hal Jordan has returned as Green Lantern.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Recently, after his capture and further experimentation by the gremlins, the aliens which sent the meteor that gave him his powers, he seems to have recovered the ability to speak without using telepathy.<ref name="gl4">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #4 (August 2005)</ref><ref name="gl5">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #5 (November 2005)</ref><ref name="gl6">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #6 (December 2005)</ref>

Hammond appears in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]: Villains United'' special, being broken out of prison along with several other supervillains.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Hammond's telepathic thoughts are shown from Belle Reve Prison, stating "It has [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]", after an unknown force pulled Parallax away.<ref name="gl51">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #51 (February 2010)</ref> In a later issue [[Krona (comics)|this strange force]] helps Hammond get out of prison, to pursue the entity trapped inside [[Agent Orange (DC Comics)|Larfleeze's]] lantern. Hammond attacks Larfleeze and Hal Jordan, and during the fight manages to swallow Larfleeze's battery, allowing the entity, Ophidian, to possess his body just as Parallax possessed Hal's.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #56 (June 2010)</ref> The battle with Ophidian doesn't go very well for Hal or Larfleeze. While fleeing Ophidian, Larfleeze admits that he wasn't entirely honest about his ownership of the orange lantern and that he and Ophidian have a rather antagonistic relationship, however he is quick to blame Ophidian for starting whatever it was that came between them. Ophidian states that Larfleeze was the only being in the universe capable of resisting his temptations thereby allowing Larfleeze to subdue him and become Agent Orange, and now it's Larfleeze's turn to be subdued and used by Ophidian, Ophidian then attempts to devour Larfleeze but he is saved by Hal. After that the desires of Hector begin to override those of Ophidian and he leaves to search for his ultimate desire "Carol Ferris".<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #57 (September 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Hammond in his mutated state exhibits genius level intellect, potent telepathic and telekinetic abilities,<ref name="dc-ency"/> and on occasion displays the ability to absorb and mentally redirect Green Lantern's emerald plasma.
In some incarnations, his body has atrophied to the point where he cannot walk and he has to strap his head to a chair to support its weight.
