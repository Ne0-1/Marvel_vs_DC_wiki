'''Hector Hammond''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Universe]] [[supervillain]] who is primarily an enemy of [[Green Lantern]]. The character was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]], and originally appeared as in ''Green Lantern (vol. 2)'' # 5 (March-April 1961). Unlike many supervillains, Hammond does not use an alias. 

==Fictional character biography==

Hammond is a fugitive on the run from the law when he discovers the fragments of a strange [[meteor]] in the woods (part of this meteor lands in Africa, where it evolves the [[gorilla]]s inhabiting the area. One of these gorillas later becomes the supervillain Gorilla [[Grodd]].<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2 69</ref>).  Observing that radiation from the meteor has caused the nearby plants to evolve rapidly, Hammond decides to kidnap four [[scientist]]s and expose them to the meteor.  The radiation causes their intellects to evolve, but also has the side effect of sapping their wills.  Hammond is able to force the scientists to use their hightened intellect to create amazing new inventions, which Hammond sells for his own profit.  

Hammond rapidly becomes a rich celebrity due to the wealth he has acquired.  [[Hal Jordan]] asks his friend and mechanic, [[Thomas Kalmaku]], to take on the role of the Green Lantern while Jordan investigates Hammond.  Jordan creates a duplicate power ring and costume for Kalmaku to fool Hammond.  Unaware of the impersonation, Hammond kidnaps Kalmaku, steals his ring and turns him into a chimpanzee.  Jordan confronts Hammond personally in a destructive battle of power rings that ends only when Hammond's ring charge expires, allowing Jordan to capture him and restore Kalmaku and the scientists.

Hammond returns in ''Justice League of America'' #14 (September 1962), where he has managed to escape from prison and deliberately exposes himself to the [[meteorite]].  The radition causes his brain to grow to enormous size, granting him [[psionic]] powers as well as immortality in the process.  Unfortunately, his body becomes immoblized and he loses the power to speak.  Trapped in a motionless state, Hammond is still able to use his psionic powers to control the Green Lantern's mind.  He attempts to steal the Green Lantern's ring, but Jordan manages to command his ring to drain itself of power when it leaves his finger.  He is then able to render Hammond unconscious with a punch to the jaw.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #25</ref>

Hammond is responsible for the creation of the second [[Royal Flush Gang]] in ''Justice League of America'' #203 (June 1982).  Hammond and the Gang are defeated when Dr. Martin Stein, one half of the superhero [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], subdues Hector on the astral plane.

In addition to battling Hal Jordan, Hammond has also fought [[Alan Scott]]<ref>''Green Lantern Quarterly'' #2</ref> as well as [[Kyle Rayner]]<ref>''Green Lantern 80-Page Giant'' #2</ref>.

==After ''Green Lantern: Rebirth''==
Hammond has reappeared now that Hal Jordan has returned as Green Lantern. Recently, after his capture and further experimentation by the gremlins, he seems to have recovered the ability to speak without using telepathy.

Hammond was last seen in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]: Villains United'' special, being broken out of prison along with several other supervillains.

== Powers and abilities ==
Hammond in his mutated state exhibits genius level intellect, potent telepathic and telekinetic abilities, and on occasion displays the ability to absorb and mentally redirect Green Lantern's emerald plasma.
