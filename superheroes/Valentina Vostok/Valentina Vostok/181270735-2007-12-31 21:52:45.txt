'''Valentina Vostok''' (alternately spelled '''Valentina Vostock''') is a [[fictional character]] by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #94, (August 1977), and was created by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Jim Aparo]].

==Fictional character biography==
Lt. Col. Valentina Vostok of the [[Soviet Air Force]] steals an experimental Russian Fighter Plane in order to defect to the [[USA]]. The plane malfunctions en route and she crash-lands at the spot where the original [[Doom Patrol]] had apparently perished and is infused with the negative energy being which formerly inhabited the body of the Patrol's [[Negative Man]]. Years later, it was revealed by Doom Patrol villain [[Brain (comics)|the Brain]] that [[Niles Caulder]], founder of the Doom Patrol, manipulated Valentina's transformation into a superhero in order to create a replacement for presumed dead Negative Man. 

Assuming the name '''Negative Woman''', Valentina defected to the United States and becomes a member of the second incarnation of Doom Patrol for several years. Valentina becomes romantically involved with teammate [[Joshua Clay]] but breaks off the relationship due to the unstable nature of her powers, which leaves her body irregularly radioactive and eventually required her to shave her long blonde hair and constantly wear radiation-blocking bandages over all of her body. 

Ultimately, when Negative Man is found alive and rescued by the new Doom Patrol, the negative energy being abandons Valentina and returns to Larry Trainor. Though she is initially furious at having lost her power and being replaced by Negative Man, his ultimate rejection of the power allows for Valentina to leave Doom Patrol on good terms, unaware of the fact that the negative energy being would ultimately return and claim Trainor again, turning him into Rebis. 

Valentina would go on to work for the American secret services, being involved in a number of US government departments including serving for a time as head of the [[List of government agencies in comics#The Agency|Agency]] and working for the original incarnation of [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]].  

===White Queen===
Vostok was later named White Queen of the current incarnation of Checkmate, replacing [[Amanda Waller]].

==Powers and abilities==
Valentina formerly possessed a radioactive 'soul-self', and was capable of flight, intangibility and could generate minor explosions upon contact with positive energy. She no longer possesses these abilities.
