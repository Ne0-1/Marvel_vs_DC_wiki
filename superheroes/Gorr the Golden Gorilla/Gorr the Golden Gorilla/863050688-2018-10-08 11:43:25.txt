Gorr is a golden [[gorilla]] given human intelligence and greatly increased strength by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #172</ref>

Fearing that [[Galactus]] was about to destroy his creation [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the High Evolutionary created Gorr and sent him to Earth to seek the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]].{{issue|date=August 2012}} However, when he arrived on Earth, Gorr became inexplicably mutated into a [[King Kong]]-sized monstrosity and went on a rampage through Manhattan, climbing to the top of the [[Chrysler Building]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> When the Fantastic Four intervened, Gorr duped them into coming aboard his ship and transported them to Counter-Earth. The Fantastic Four, High Evolutionary, and Gorr were unable to convince Galactus not to destroy Counter-Earth, though Galactus challenged them to find a replacement within 48 hours. Gorr and the [[Human Torch]] found an Earth-like planet, which turned out to be inhabited by [[Skrull]]s. The Skrulls abandoned the planet after an altercation with Gorr, leaving the planet uninhabited and thus worthless to Galactus. Ultimately, the [[Impossible Man]] convinced Galactus to devour his own planet of Poppup instead. Gorr remained with the High Evolutionary as a "[[valet]]."<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #171-175</ref>

Much later, Gorr became a prisoner/research project of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], held captive on his laboratory world alongside Stranger's other prisoners.<ref>''Quasar #14-15</ref> When the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] attacked the Stranger, he freed the Stranger's captives including Gorr who escaped.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Gorr is a golden-colored gorilla given human intelligence and greatly increased strength by the [[High Evolutionary]]. Gorr also has an immunity to fire.

==Gorr the God Butcher==
===Publication history===
[[Jason Aaron]] and [[Esad Ribic]] decided to reboot the Thor franchise during the [[Marvel Now]] initiative. Gorr first appeared in Thor: God of Thunder #2 (January, 2013). This story arc was voted as the 8th best Thor story by Comicbook.com.<ref> http://comicbook.com/2014/09/28/10-greatest-thor-stories-of-all-time/</ref>

===Fictional character biography===
[[File:Gorr_the_god_butcher.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Gorr from ''Thor: God of Thunder''. Pencils by [[Esad Ribic]].]]
Gorr grew up on a nameless barren planet. When his mother, mate and children died, he thought gods did not exist. When he learned they did exist but did not help him and his family, he vowed to kill them all after acquiring the All-Black the Necrosword from Knull.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6</ref><ref>''Venom'' (Vol) 3 #4</ref> He eventually finds young [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Odinson]] on Earth in [[Medieval]] [[Iceland]]. He nearly kills Thor, but a band of [[Vikings]] come to rescue him. Gorr escapes, but learns he needs help, so he creates an army of shadow berserkers, then slowly and quietly eliminates more and more gods. In the present, Thor notices the missing gods and investigates their disappearances. This brings Gorr and Thor to another battle, but Gorr then teleports into the future, where an aged Thor is the last Asgardian defending the realm against the shadow berserkers. Gorr also brings the young Thor into the future, where his wife and children have seemingly been resurrected and is about to set off the Godbomb. The Necrosword is actually a construct of Gorr's deceased son and despises what his father has turned into, so it gives Thor the power to absorb the blast. Thor, the Avenger then uses two Mjolnirs to kill Gorr.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #11 (October, 2013)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Gorr possesses the "All-Black the Necrosword", which according to Galactus, "carved the first dawn from the stone of the endless night."<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #23</ref> The blade was forged by Knull, the progenitor of the ''[[Klyntar]]'', using the blood of a ''[[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]''.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4, Issue #4</ref> The blade allows its user to create wings, weapons and a shroud out of darkness. He can create sharp tendrils that can kill any god, including [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. The blade is later banished into a [[black hole]], but an elderly King Thor uses it to battle [[Galactus]].<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #23</ref> Gorr also created the Godbomb, an anti-divinity armament designed to kill every god who had or ever would exist.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #11 (October, 2013)</ref> Gorr possesses superhuman strength, durability and edurance. He is also virtually immortal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>
