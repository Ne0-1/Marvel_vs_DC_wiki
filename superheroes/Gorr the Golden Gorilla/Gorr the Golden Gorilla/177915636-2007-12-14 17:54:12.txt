'''Gorr''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Gorr is a golden-colored gorilla given human intelligence and greatly increased strength by the [[High Evolutionary]].

Fearing that [[Galactus]] was about to destroy his creation, [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the High Evolutionary created Gorr and sent him to Earth to seek the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]].  However, when he arrived on Earth, Gorr became inexplicably mutated into a King Kong-sized monstrosity and went on a rampage through Manhattan.  When the Fantastic Four intervened, Gorr duped them into coming aboard his ship and transported them to Counter-Earth.

The Fantastic Four, High Evolutionary, and Gorr were unable to convince Galactus not to destroy Counter-Earth, though Galactus challenged them to find a replacement within 48 hours.  Gorr and the [[Human Torch]] found an Earth-like planet, which turned out to be inhabited by [[Skrull]]s.  The Skrulls abandoned the planet after an altercation with Gorr, leaving the planet uninhabited and thus worthless to Galactus.  Ultimately, the [[Impossible Man]] convinced Galactus to devour his own planet of Poppup instead.  Gorr remained with the High Evolutionary as a servant.

Much later, Gorr became a prisoner/research project of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], held captive on his laboratory world.  When the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] attacked the Stranger, he freed the Stranger's captives, including Gorr, who escaped.
