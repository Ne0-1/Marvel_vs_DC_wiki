Gorr is a golden-colored gorilla given human intelligence and greatly increased strength by the [[High Evolutionary]].{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Fearing that [[Galactus]] was about to destroy his creation, [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the High Evolutionary created Gorr and sent him to Earth to seek the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]].{{issue|date=August 2012}} However, when he arrived on Earth, Gorr became inexplicably mutated into a King Kong-sized monstrosity and went on a rampage through Manhattan, climbing to the top of the [[Chrysler Building]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> When the Fantastic Four intervened, Gorr duped them into coming aboard his ship and transported them to Counter-Earth.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

The Fantastic Four, High Evolutionary, and Gorr were unable to convince Galactus not to destroy Counter-Earth, though Galactus challenged them to find a replacement within 48 hours.{{issue|date=August 2012}} Gorr and the [[Human Torch]] found an Earth-like planet, which turned out to be inhabited by [[Skrull]]s.{{issue|date=August 2012}} The Skrulls abandoned the planet after an altercation with Gorr, leaving the planet uninhabited and thus worthless to Galactus. Ultimately, the [[Impossible Man]] convinced Galactus to devour his own planet of Poppup instead.{{issue|date=August 2012}} Gorr remained with the High Evolutionary as a servant.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Much later, Gorr became a prisoner/research project of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], held captive on his laboratory world. When the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] attacked the Stranger, he freed the Stranger's captives, including Gorr, who escaped.{{issue|date=August 2012}}
