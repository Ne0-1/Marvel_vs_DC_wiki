==Fictional character biography==
Mannheim is one of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most powerful gangsters, the leader of the [[Intergang]].

===52===
Since his return in the miniseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he claims now to have been "reborn" thanks to the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] villain [[Darkseid]], and to have become a [[psychopath]]. 

During Week 25, now a devoted worshipper of crime itself, he has Intergang follow "The Crime Bible," of which the original copy is bound by the stone that [[Cain]] killed [[Abel]] with. He's also been shown to now be a [[cannibal]], killing and then eating those whom do not submit to (or simply do not immediately join) Intergang. His victims were [[Kite Man]], [[Lamelle]], [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]] (as seen in the picture above), [[Rawson (comics)|Rawson]], Sewer King, and [[Squid (DC Comics)|Squid]].<ref>"52" Week Twenty-Five</ref>

Over the course of the series, he comes into conflict with [[Renee Montoya]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and the new [[Batwoman]], whom he wishes to sacrifice. As of Week 48, Batwoman rips Mannheim's knife out of her own chest and impales him in the back, seemingly fatally. This is during Mannheim's attempt to turn Gotham into a miniature replica of [[Apokolips]]. Batwoman survives her injuries.

Superman encounters him several weeks later, mutated to be several stories tall. Before teleporting away, he states that Darkseid is not his master anymore and that someone else is his master.

====Superman: The Animated Series====
{{main|Superman: The Animated Series}}
Mannheim appeared in five episodes of ''Superman: The Animated Series'', and was voiced by [[Bruce Weitz]]. Much like (until recently) his comics counterpart, he runs Intergang, but is highly obnoxious, and not quite as evil. One of his enemies is the [[Toyman]], whose father was a patsy for one Mannheim's embezzling schemes. He agreed to work for Darkseid in exchange for power, but when it came time to deliver on the bargain Darkseid went back on his word. Bruno accosted Darkseid by pointing out that he promised to "make him a king", to which Darkseid replied "And so you are, the king of fools." Bruno was then left stranded on a desert island where a nuclear bomb was set to go off. Despite managing to get on a motorboat, it was caught in the explosion when it was some inches from the island. After that, Darkseid had [[Granny Goodness]] take over Intergang.

====The Batman Strikes!====
{{main|The Batman Strikes!}}
