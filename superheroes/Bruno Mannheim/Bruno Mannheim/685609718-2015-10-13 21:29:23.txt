'''Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim''' is a villain who appears in [[DC Comics]] as one of [[Superman]]'s enemies.

==Publication history==
He first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #139 (July 1971) and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mannheim is one of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most powerful gangsters, the leader of the [[Intergang]]. He is also the son of [[Moxie "Boss" Mannheim]].<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (2005)</ref>

Since his return in the miniseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he claims now to have been "reborn" thanks to the [[New God]] [[Darkseid]], and to have become a [[psychopath]].

During Week 25, now a devoted worshipper of crime itself, he has Intergang follow "The [[Crime Bible]]," of which the original copy is bound by the stone with which [[Cain]] killed [[Abel]]. He's also been shown to now be a [[cannibal]], killing and then eating those whom do not submit to (or simply do not immediately join) Intergang like he did with [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]] (as seen in the picture above). Bruno Mannheim later abducted [[Kite Man]], Lamelle, Rawson, Sewer King, and [[Squid (DC Comics)|Squid]] in order to get them to join Intergang. Some of them turned him down and were killed as a result.<ref>"52" Week Twenty-Five</ref>

Over the course of the series, he comes into conflict with [[Renee Montoya]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and the new [[Batwoman]], whom he wishes to sacrifice. As of Week 48, Mannheim has captured Batwoman and has her bound and gagged to a sacrificial altar, stabbing her through the heart shortly thereafter. When Montoya arrives and rescues her lover, Batwoman rips Mannheim's knife out of her own chest and impales him in the back, seemingly fatally. This is during Mannheim's attempt to turn Gotham into a miniature replica of [[Apokolips]]. Batwoman survives her injuries.

Superman encounters him several weeks later, mutated to be several stories tall. Before teleporting away, he states that Darkseid is not his master anymore. Based on that comment, someone else is behind Intergang's recent activity.<ref>''Superman" #654"</ref>

In ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim and Intergang were involved in a gang war with [[Tobias Whale]].

==In other media==

===Television===
* The son of Moxie Mannheim's (Bruno) character appeared in three episodes of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' under the name '''Bill Church Jr.''' played by [[Bruce Campbell]]. In "Individual Responsibility", Bill Church Jr is the son of the original leader of Intergang and takes over as leader of Intergang that would commit various crimes around Metropolis and runs MultiWorld Communications. Perry was great friends with Bill Church and his son, however, Perry doesn't know that Jr has turned to being a criminal. Church Jr kidnaps Perry White because his boss [[Franklin Stern]] won't sell the Daily Planet, meanwhile, Lois and Clark are trying to crack down on Intergang and foil their operations. Superman tries to stop Intergang and comes into contact with [[Red kryptonite]], which affects Superman in that he doesn't care about standing up for justice like he is portrayed in the series and lets Intergang get away with their crimes. Superman also sees a psychiatrist to fix his relationship with Lois. In "We Have a Lot to Talk About", Perry learns the truth about Bill Church Jr being a criminal. '''Bill Church Sr.''' (portrayed by [[Peter Boyle]]) has a new wife named Mindy (played by [[Jessica Collins]]), in which his son likes her. His father wants to dismantle Intergang and continue to running operations with his Church group. Bill Jr is not happy with his father's idea and seeks to continue Intergang. However, Mindy double-crosses Bill Church Sr. and Bill Church Jr. and runs Intergang for herself after both Churches were arrested by the police.

* Bruno Mannheim appeared in five episodes of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Bruce Weitz]]. Mannheim runs Intergang, as in the comic books. One of his enemies is the [[Toyman]], whose father was a patsy for one Mannheim's embezzling schemes. In "Tools of the Trade," he and Intergang received high-tech weapons from [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]]. After Superman defeated him, Bruno fled with Kanto and ended up meeting Kanto's boss Darkseid. Mannheim agreed to work for Darkseid in exchange for power. In "Father's Day," he alongside [[Desaad]] and [[Kalibak]] watch Superman fight a robot that Desaad sent to Earth. After Darkseid declined Kalibak's offer to fight Superman, Bruno suggested Darkseid to send him back to Earth so that he can get Intergang back together. Darkseid denied the offer and teleported Bruno to the fire pits where he was put to work shoveling coal into the furnaces. When it came time for Darkseid to deliver his end of the bargain to Bruno Mannheim in "Apokolips...Now" Pt. 1, Darkseid went back on his word. Bruno accosted Darkseid by pointing out that he promised to "make him a king" to which Darkseid replied "And so you are, the king of fools." Bruno was then left stranded on a desert island where a nuclear bomb was set to go off. Despite managing to get on a motorboat, it was caught in the explosion when it was a little way from the island and capsized. Mannheim apparently perished in the blast as he wasn't seen again. After that, Darkseid had [[Granny Goodness]] take over Intergang.

* Bruno Mannheim made an appearance in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "Stiletto" played by [[Dominic Zamprogna]]. In the Smallville universe, Mannheim was a thug for the mob and [[Ace o' Clubs]] owner Ron Milano. He made counterfeit money and mugged Chloe along with another, AJ, stealing her bag and getting a whack from Lois before leaving in his car. He returned to the Ace of Clubs and got a drink from new bartender Jimmy Olsen, who asked to get an advance on his pay from owner Ron. Ricky then came to get Mannheim because Ron wanted to see him, but when Ron began to mock Mannheim for the mugging, Mannheim turned on him shooting him dead with a silenced gun in the back room of the Ace of Clubs when Ron said that they were going legit. He then took over Milano's businesses and announced that they were first going to get rid of the heroes starting with Stiletto. When Jimmy came back into work late holding his camera, Mannheim took it off him and recognized the photos of Chloe and Lois as Stiletto and beat him for information before knocking him out. He was then in the back room seeing through the counterfeit money when Clark rushed in at super speed. Kryptonite used on the money, however, weakened Clark enough that Mannheim could punch him to the floor and beat him. Lois as Stiletto jumped down and knocked Clark away in time. As Mannheim went to shoot her, Clark jumped in front of Lois, blocking her from danger. Jimmy came in and was able to take Mannheim down. In season 10 of Smallville, Mannheim did not make an appearance, but he was mentioned in "Beacon." Lois mentioned Mannheim to Martha Kent as a possible conspirator to her assassination attempt.

* Bruno Mannheim appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Disordered" voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. He is seen as a member of Intergang. Superboy and the [[Forever People]] stumble upon him and the rest of Intergang robbing an underground gold vault using weapons and technology from Apokolips. He escapes the initial encounter and later is stripped of his weaponry and captured when Superboy takes command of a corrupted Infinity-Man and turns it against Mannheim. In "Salvage," Mannheim and Whisper A'Daire use a special technology to merge the four [[Appellaxian]] host bodies into one Appellaxian Golem. Mannheim planned to use the Appellaxian Golem into making it an enforcer for Intergang. Blue Beetle manages to restrain Mannheim and Whisper with special locks. Mannheim and Whisper are later put into a catatonic-like state by [[Sportsmaster]] as a warning to anyone who goes against [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]], suggesting the two were operating independently.
