==Fictional character biography==
Mannheim is one of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most powerful gangsters, the leader of the [[Intergang]]. He is also the son of [[Moxie Mannheim|Moxie "Boss" Mannheim]].<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (2005)</ref>

Since his return in the miniseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he claims now to have been "reborn" thanks to the [[New God]] [[Darkseid]], and to have become a psychopath.

During Week 25, now a devoted worshipper of crime itself, he has Intergang follow "The [[Crime Bible]]" of which the original copy is bound by the stone with which [[Cain]] killed [[Abel]]. He is also been shown to now be a cannibal, killing and then eating those whom do not submit to (or simply do not immediately join) Intergang like he did with [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]]. Bruno Mannheim later abducted [[Kite Man]], Lamelle, Rawson, Sewer King, and [[Squid (DC Comics)|Squid]] in order to get them to join Intergang. Some of them turned him down and were killed as a result.<ref>"52" Week Twenty-Five</ref>

Over the course of the series, he comes into conflict with [[Renee Montoya]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and the new [[Batwoman]], whom he wishes to sacrifice. As of Week 48, Mannheim has captured Batwoman and has her bound and gagged to a sacrificial altar, stabbing her through the heart shortly thereafter. When Montoya arrives and rescues her lover, Batwoman rips Mannheim's knife out of her own chest and impales him in the back, seemingly fatally. This is during Mannheim's attempt to turn Gotham into a miniature replica of [[Apokolips]]. Batwoman survives her injuries.

Superman encounters him several weeks later, mutated to be several stories tall. Before teleporting away, he states that Darkseid is not his master anymore. Based on that comment, someone else is behind Intergang's recent activity.<ref>''Superman" #654"</ref>

In ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim and Intergang were involved in a gang war with [[Tobias Whale]].
