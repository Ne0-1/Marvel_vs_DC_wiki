'''Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim''' is a fictional character who appears in [[DC Comics]] as one of [[Superman]]'s enemies. He first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #139, (July 1971), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mannheim is one of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most powerful gangsters, the leader of the [[Intergang]]. He is also the son of [[Moxie "Boss" Mannheim]]

===52===
Since his return in the miniseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he claims now to have been "reborn" thanks to the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] villain [[Darkseid]], and to have become a [[psychopath]]. 

During Week 25, now a devoted worshipper of crime itself, he has Intergang follow "The Crime Bible," of which the original copy is bound by the stone with which [[Cain]] killed [[Abel]]. He's also been shown to now be a [[cannibal]], killing and then eating those whom do not submit to (or simply do not immediately join) Intergang. His victims were [[Kite Man]], Lamelle, [[Mirage (DC Comics)|Mirage]] (as seen in the picture above), Rawson, [[Sewer King (Batman)|Sewer King]], and [[Squid (DC Comics)|Squid]].<ref>"52" Week Twenty-Five</ref>

Over the course of the series, he comes into conflict with [[Renee Montoya]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and the new [[Batwoman]], whom he wishes to sacrifice. As of Week 48, Mannheim has captured Batwoman and has her bound and gagged to a sacrificial altar, stabbing her through the heart shortly thereafter. When Montoya arrives and rescues her lover, Batwoman rips Mannheim's knife out of her own chest and impales him in the back, seemingly fatally. This is during Mannheim's attempt to turn Gotham into a miniature replica of [[Apokolips]]. Batwoman survives her injuries.

Superman encounters him several weeks later, mutated to be several stories tall. Before teleporting away, he states that Darkseid is not his master anymore. Based on that comment, someone else is behind Intergang's recent activity.

===Gotham Underground===
In ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim and Intergang were involved in a gang war with [[Tobias Whale]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* Bruno Mannheim appeared in five episodes of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' portrayed by voice-actor [[Bruce Weitz]]. Much like (until recently) his comics counterpart, he runs Intergang, but is highly obnoxious. One of his enemies is the [[Toyman]], whose father was a patsy for one Mannheim's embezzling schemes. In "Tools of the Trade," he and Intergang received high-tech weapons from [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]]. After Superman defeated him, Bruno fled with Kanto and ended up meeting Kanto's boss Darkseid. Mannheim agreed to work for Darkseid in exchange for power. In "Father's Day," he alongside [[Desaad]] and [[Kalibak]] watch Superman fight a robot that Desaad sent to Earth. After Darkseid declined Kalibak's offer to fight Superman, Bruno suggested Darkseid to send him back to Earth so that he can get Intergang back together. Darkseid denied the offer and teleported Bruno to the fire pits where he was put to work shoveling coal into the furnaces. When it came time for Darkseid to deliver his end of the bargain to Bruno Mannheim in "Apokolips...Now" Pt. 1, Darkseid went back on his word. Bruno accosted Darkseid by pointing out that he promised to "make him a king" to which Darkseid replied "And so you are, the king of fools." Bruno was then left stranded on a desert island where a nuclear bomb was set to go off. Despite managing to get on a motorboat, it was caught in the explosion when it was a little way from the island and capsized. Mannheim apparently perished in the blast as he wasn't seen again. After that, Darkseid had [[Granny Goodness]] take over Intergang.

* Bruno Mannheim made an appearance in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "Stiletto" played by [[Dominic Zamprogna]]. In the Smallville universe, Bruno Mannheim was a thug for the mob and Ace of Clubs owner Ron Milano. He made counterfeit money and mugged Chloe along with another, AJ, stealing her bag and getting a whack from Lois before leaving in his car. He returned to the Ace of Clubs and got a drink from new bartender Jimmy Olsen, who asked to get an advance on his pay from owner Ron. Ricky then came to get Bruno because Ron wanted to see him, but when Ron began to mock Bruno for the mugging, Bruno turned on him shooting him dead with a silenced gun in the back room of the Ace of Clubs when Ron said that they were going legit. He then took over Milano's businesses and announced that the they were first going to get rid of the heroes starting with Stiletto. When Jimmy came back into work late holding his camera, Bruno took it off him and recognized the photos of Chloe and Lois as Stiletto and beat him for information before knocking him out. He was then in the back room seeing through the counterfeit money when Clark rushed in at super speed. Kryptonite used on the money, however, weakened Clark enough that Bruno could punch him to the floor and beat him. Lois as Stiletto jumped down and knocked Clark away in time. As Bruno went to shoot her, Clark jumped in front of Lois, blocking her from danger. Jimmy came in and was able to take Bruno down.

===Video games===
* Bruno Manneheim appeared as his animated counterpart in ''[[Superman: Countdown to Apokolips]]''.

He plans to use these villains to take down the Justice League and take over Metropolis. Bruno Manneheim turned himself into a version of [[Metallo]]. His plans ultimately fail when [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] defeat him and his super thugs.
