'''Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim''' is a fictional charcter who appears in [[DC Comics]] as one of [[Superman]]'s enemies. He first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #139, (July 1971), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mannheim is one of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most powerful gangsters, the leader of the [[Intergang]]. Since his return in the miniseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he claims now to have been "reborn" thanks to the [[extraterrestrial]] villain [[Darkseid]], and to have become a  [[psychopath]]. Now a devoted worshipper of crime itself, he has Intergang follow "The Crime Bible", of which the original copy is bound by the stone that [[Cain]] killed [[Abel]] with. He's also been shown to now be a cannibal, killing and then eating those whom do not submit to (or even do not then immediately join) Intergang.

==In Other Media==
Manheim appeared in five episodes of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', and was voiced by [[Bruce Weitz]]. Much like (until recently) his comics counterpart, he runs Intergang, but is highly obnoxious, and less completely evil. One of his enemies is the [[Toyman]], whose father was a pawn in one Manheim's embezzling schemes.
