'''Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim''' is a fictional character who appears in [[DC Comics]] as one of [[Superman]]'s enemies. He first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #139, (July 1971), and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mannheim is one of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' most powerful gangsters, the leader of the [[Intergang]]. Since his return in the miniseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', he claims now to have been "reborn" thanks to the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] villain [[Darkseid]], and to have become a [[psychopath]]. Now a devoted worshipper of crime itself, he has Intergang follow "The Crime Bible," of which the original copy is bound by the stone that [[Cain]] killed [[Abel]] with. He's also been shown to now be a cannibal, killing and then eating those whom do not submit to (or simply do not immediately join) Intergang. One of his victims was the criminal [[Mirage (comics)|Mirage]], as seen in the picture above. As of Week 48 he has been stabbed, seemingly fatally, in the back while attempting to turn Gotham into a miniature replica of Apokolips.

Superman encounters him several weeks later, mutated to be several stories tall. Before teleporting away, he states that Darkseid is not his master anymore.

==In Other Media==
Mannheim appeared in five episodes of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', and was voiced by [[Bruce Weitz]]. Much like (until recently) his comics counterpart, he runs Intergang, but is highly obnoxious, and not quite as evil. One of his enemies is the [[Toyman]], whose father was a patsy for one Mannheim's embezzling schemes. He agreed to work for Darkseid in exchange for power, but Darkseid had him killed once his purpose was completed, leaving him stranded on a desert island where a nuclear bomb was set to go off.
