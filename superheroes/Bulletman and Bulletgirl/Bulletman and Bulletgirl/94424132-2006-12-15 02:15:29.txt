'''Bulletman''' was a [[Fawcett Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Bill Parker]] and [[Jon Smalle]] for ''Nickel Comics'' #1 in May, 1940.

Jim Barr was the son of a police officer who was killed and as a result took it upon himself to fight crime. Like many characters of the time, he used chemistry to develop powers for himself; in his case greater muscle mass and brain power.  He also invented a Gravity Regulator Helmet (which was bullet shaped and gave him his name), which allowed him to fly and deflect bullets.

Shortly after Bulletman began his crime-fighting career began he created a second helmet for his girlfriend and later wife Susan Kent, who adopted the name '''Bulletgirl'''. 

Bulletman and Bulletgirl were [[Fawcett Comics]]' second most popular characters after [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Marvel Family]]. They were acquired by [[DC Comics]] along with the rest of the Fawcett comics stable of characters in [[1972]]. However, the characters lapsed into public domain prior to the said acquisition, which would later allow [[AC Comics]] to reprint their Golden Age adventures. 

During this period of time, Bulletman and Bulletgirl appeared with fellow Fawcett heroes to form Shazam's [[Squadron of Justice]] against the forces of King Kull. Their age appeared to be as it was in the 1940's without explanation. They subsequently appeared a few times with Captain Marvel and his family.

Bulletman and Bulletgirl were eventually retrofitted into DC Universe continuity as members of the [[All-Star Squadron]], and in the pages of ''[[The Power of Shazam]]'' were given a daughter named Deanna Barr, who donned her mother's helmet and operated briefly under the name Windshear. Bulletman and Bulletgirl also appeared in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' [[limited series]].

In 2005, a new Bulletgirl known as [[Bulleteer]] was introduced as one of the Seven in [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]. She is unrelated to these older heroes, though her costume is to some extent inspired by theirs. In issue #3, Susan Barr appeared in a brief cameo, visiting her successor.

Bulletman and Bulletgirl later re-appeared in the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' on the newly reborn Earth-S along with the other Fawcett superheroes. 

==Trivia==
[[Image:BulletJoe.jpg|150px|left|Ad for 1970's GI Joes including Bulletman.]]In the late 1970's, the [[Hasbro]] toy company produced an apparently unlicensed Bulletman [[action figure]] as part of its [[GI Joe]] toy line. This foot-tall toy was almost identical to the classic Fawcett character, except that it had [[vacuum metalized]] silver arms.
