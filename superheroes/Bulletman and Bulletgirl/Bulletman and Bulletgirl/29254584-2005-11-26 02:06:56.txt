'''Bulletman''' was a [[Fawcett Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Bill Parker]] in ''Nickel Comics'', May, 1940.

Jim Barr was the son of a police officer who was killed and as a result took it upon himself to fight crime. Like many characters of the time, he used chemistry to develop powers for himself; in his case greater muscle mass and brain power.  He also invented a Gravity Regulator Helmet (which was bullet shaped and gave him his name), which allowed him to fly and deflect bullets.

Shortly after Bulletman began his crime-fighting career began he created a second helmet for his girlfriend and later wife Susan Kent, who adopted the name '''Bulletgirl'''. 

Bulletman and Bulletgirl were most likely [[Fawcett Comics]]' second most popular characters after [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. They were bought by [[DC Comics]] along with the rest of the Fawcett comics stable of characters in the [[1970s]].

Bulletman and Bulletgirl were eventually retrofitted into DC Universe continuity as members of the [[All-Star Squadron]], and in the pages of [[Power of Shazam]] were given a daughter named Deanna Barr, who operated briefly under the name [[Windshear (DC Comics)|Windshear]].

Bulletman and Bulletgirl also appeared in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s [[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]] published by [[DC Comics]].

In 2005 a new Bulletgirl known as [[Bulleteer]] will be one of the 7 in [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]. She is unrelated to these older heroes, though her costume is to some extent inspired by their designs.
