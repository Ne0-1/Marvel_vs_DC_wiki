'''Bulletman''' was a [[Fawcett Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Bill Parker]] and [[Jon Smalle]] for ''Nickel Comics'' #1 in May, 1940.

==Fictional character biography==
Jim Barr was the son of a police officer who was killed and as a result took it upon himself to fight crime. Like many characters of the time, he used chemistry to develop powers for himself; in his case greater muscle mass and brain power.  He also invented a Gravity Regulator Helmet (which was bullet shaped and gave him his name), which allowed him to fly and deflect bullets.<ref name="dc-ency2">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Bulletman | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 63  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Shortly after Bulletman began his crime-fighting career, he created a second helmet for his girlfriend and later wife Susan Kent, who adopted the name '''Bulletgirl'''.<ref name="dc-ency1">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Bulletgirl I & II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 63  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Bulletman and Bulletgirl were [[Fawcett Comics]]' second most popular characters after [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Marvel Family]]. They were acquired by [[DC Comics]] along with the rest of the Fawcett comics stable of characters in 1972. However, the characters lapsed into public domain prior to the said acquisition, which would later allow [[AC Comics]] to reprint their Golden Age adventures.

During this period of time, Bulletman and Bulletgirl appeared with fellow Fawcett heroes to form Shazam's [[Squadron of Justice]] against the forces of King Kull. Their age appeared to be as it was in the 1940's without explanation. They subsequently appeared a few times with Captain Marvel and his family.

Bulletman and Bulletgirl were eventually retrofitted into DC Universe continuity as members of the [[All-Star Squadron]]. For example, it is established that during World War 2, Bulletman met the long-lived [[Green Lantern]] [[Abin Sur]]. In issues #39-40 of Starman (1998) James Barr is accused of being a traitor to the United States. He is seemingly implicated in the Nazi-attack on the ''Normandie'' ocean liner in New York. This contradicts what is known by Jack Knight's father, Ted Knight, whose life Barr saved, in Alaska, on the day of the Normandie attack.

Constrained by promises of confidentiality to the same government that is prosecuting him, Barr goes on the run with Ted while ''Minute Man'' tries to get the secret oath rescinded. Captain Marvel, currently much younger than Bulletman (than he was back then) fights with Jack Knight in an attempt to arrest Barr.

===Windshear===
In ''[[The Power of Shazam]]'' #32 (November 1997), James Barr and Susan Kent were given a daughter named Deanna Barr, who donned her mother's helmet and operated briefly under the name Windshear (not to be confused with the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero of the same name).  She teamed up with her father on his last adventure, to rescue [[Billy Batson]], [[Mary Bromfield]] and [[Freddy Freeman]] from the villain [[Chain Lightning]].<ref name="dc-ency1"/>

===Bulleteer===
{{main|Bulleteer}}
In 2005, a new Bulletgirl known as [[Bulleteer]] was introduced as one of the Seven in [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]. She is unrelated to these older heroes, though her costume is to some extent inspired by theirs. In issue #3, Susan Barr appeared in a brief cameo, visiting her successor.

===Infinite Crisis===
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
Bulletman and Bulletgirl later re-appeared in the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' on the newly reborn Earth-S along with the other Fawcett superheroes.

===The Weeper===

Bulletman and Bulletgirl had many bad guys during their Fawcett Comics run but only one would follow them to DC Comics. His name was [[The Weeper]]. He was a criminal mastermind and murderer who cried for his victims and caused tragedies where ever anyone was happy. He teamed up with [[the Joker]] in [[Justice League of America]] #136, when members of the Justice League visited [[Earth-S]], home of the Fawcett Superheroes. He is considered their arch-foe and toughest criminal to deal with.

==Other Versions==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BulletJoe.jpg|150px|right|Ad for 1970s GI Joes including Bulletman.]] -->In the late 1970s, the [[Hasbro]] toy company produced an apparently unlicensed Bulletman [[action figure]] as part of its [[GI Joe]] toy line. This foot-tall toy was very similar in appearance to the classic Fawcett character, except that it had vacuum metalized silver arms, and bare legs.

Bulletman and Bulletgirl also appeared in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' [[limited series]].

==In other media==
Bulletman appears in the [[South Park]] episode [[Imaginationland]].
