'''Kole''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics|DC Universe]].  She is a former member of the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]].

==Character history==
Professor Abel Weathers, paranoid of an impending [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear holocaust]], was attempting to find a way for humanity to survive the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] through forced [[evolution]].  One of the test subjects in his experiments was his 16-year-old daughter, Kole, whom he [[medical grafting|grafted]] with [[Promethium (comics)|Promethium]].  However, instead of evolving, she found herself with the ability to create and control silicon crystal. 

Kole was then kidnapped by the mad sun Titaness, Thia.  For two years, Thia forced Kole to use her powers to construct a crystal prison in which Thia could hold important prisoners.  Thia eventually came into conflict with the Teen Titans, which ultimately lead to the death of the goddess and Kole winning her freedom.  Lilith, a member of the Titans who had the power to tell the future, sensed the "dark clouds of destruction" around Kole and warned her that she would face a "grim future" should she return to Earth and invited her to remain in Olympus.  Kole declined, electing to reclaim her life on Earth.

Now back on Earth, Kole tried to reunite with her parents, only to find that her father's experiments had produced a house full of crystalline and insectoid monstrosities.  When the Titans came to confront him, he had them captured and attempted to subject them to the same experiments.  Kole helped them to escape, and in the ensuing conflict, Abel and his wife Marilyn transformed themselves into insects and caused the lab to self-destruct.  Having nowhere else to go, Kole chose to go with the Titans to [[New York City]], though she never officially joined the group (this fact seems to be contradicted in other later sources such as ''The Secret Origins of the Teen Titans'', in which [[Dick Grayson]] lamented how Kole was a "Titan for such a short time").

After joining the Titans, Kole lived with Adeline and Joseph Wilson. As a result of this Kole developed an immediate friendship with [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]. She was deeply upset when Jericho along with a few other Titans went on a mission to deep space and yet could not accompany Jericho with whom she had fallen in love. It was shortly after this when the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' event began.

Kole was apparently killed during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' by the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s shadow demons while trying to protect Earth 2's [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]].  It should be noted that the Crisis on Infinite Earths rewrote the origins of [[Donna Troy]], in which Thia and her fellow Titans of Myth played a major role.  This would indicate that Thia never kidnapped Kole, and thus how Kole met the Titans has been nullified.  There has yet to be an updated origin for Kole.

After her seeming death, Kole mysteriously resurfaced a few years later, where she assisted the Team Titans against a pack of [[vampire]]s.  Her powers had somehow been upgraded with the ability to [[teleportation|teleport]] from place to place at will and sense events happening miles away.  She also hinted that she wasn't anything "alive".  After helping the Team Titans in several battles, Kole vanished again.  It was later suggested that this was not in fact the real Kole, but a puppet created by [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]].  However, when an organization called The 1,000 did a data search on all the Titans, living and dead, Kole's file read "Data Inconclusive", which adds some doubt to her final fate.

Most recently, Kole's status seems to have been firmly cemented as "dead"; in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #30-31 (December 2005-January 2006), Kole appeared as a member of a team of zombie-like Titans raised from the dead by the latest incarnation of [[Brother Blood]] to fight the current (living) Titans.  When Blood's control over these undead Titans was broken by [[Kid Eternity]] (whose powers Blood had tapped to bring them "back to life"), they seemed to simultaneously decompose and vanish as they were returned to the afterlife.  Furthermore, Kole has a statue in the "hall of fallen Titans" at Titans Tower, alongside the original Hawk and Dove, the original Aquagirl and others. She is briefly mentioned during [[Jason Todd]]'s battle with [[Tim Drake]] in the "hall of fallen titans". The once dead Jason, jealous that he is not honored with a statue, bitterly tells Tim that, "You even have Kole for God's sake!"

==Powers==
Kole has the power to "spin" crystal, which is to create silicon crystal into independent masses -  anything from a crystal "sculpture to a safety slide".  She is known to encase people in crystal, effectively immobilizing them.  It is not clear what happens to the crystal she spins; whether it eventually breaks down or remains in existence has never been established (she once spun a crystal bridge to transport herself and Jericho from Manhattan to Titans Tower in the East River; what happened to that bridge is subject to debate).

Kole also has the ability to fly, but it is unclear whether this also comes from the experiments that gave her powers, or granted to her during her tenure as Thia's slave.  Later in the Teen Titans comics, Kole is seen transporting herself on a crystal carpet.  Only once had Kole been seen moving through crystal (or at least the crystal she spun herself).

==In the ''Teen Titans'' animated series==
[[Image:Kole.JPEG|left|thumb|100px|Kole in the Teen Titans Animated Series]]
Kole appears in a ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode bearing her name, alongside [[Gnarrk]], her Caveman partner. As with the other characters in Teen Titans, it was decided to render a younger, more teenager-like version of Kole for the animated series version. Her powers are very different from in her comic incarnation.  Rather than creating crystal, she literally transforms herself into it, and is directly used as a melee weapon by Gnarrk in her crystal form.  Furthermore by bending over and then transforming, Kole can be effectively become a [[boomerang]]-like weapon Gnaark can throw. Unlike her comic incarnation, her hair is pink rather than red, and two strands of her hair form a pair of fake antennaes.

Kole lives with Gnarrk in a large underground cavern near the [[Arctic Circle]] that is filled with prehistoric creatures.  They become friends with the Titans when they accidentally discover their cavern while trying to stop the villainous Dr. Light.  In this episode, [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] wanted to use Kole's crystal form as a prism to focus and enhance his newly obtained light powers from the [[aurora (astronomy)|Aurora Borealis]], but she was saved by the Titans and Gnarrk.  They both become Honorary Titans, but Kole believed she would be safe from the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], as no one knew about their location underground.

Unfortunately, the Brotherhood had hacked into the Titans' communicators and used it to listen in on her communications and locate her.  The Brotherhood later sent [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Billy Numerous|Billy Numerous]] and [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] to attack her and Gnarrk.  She, Gnarrk, and Cyborg (who had gone to rescue her) escaped, and joined in the final battle against the Brotherhood of Evil.  Kole and Gnarrk, as they rode into battle, take out [[Ding Dong Daddy]] as he rode up in his car.  She is voiced by [[Tara Strong]].

She also appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic book series.  In issue #34, Gnaark, along with several other Titans, are kidnapped and forced to participate in arena fights against [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] and other villains for the amusement of spectators.  Kole attempts to rescue him, only to end up being captured and forced to fight also.  Luckily, the other Titans find out where the fights are being held and rescue them.
