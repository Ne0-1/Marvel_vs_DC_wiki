[[Kole]] is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics|DC Universe]]. She is a former member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]].

==Character History==
Professor Abel Weathers, paranoid of an impending [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear holocaust]], was attempting to find a way for humanity to survive the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] through forced [[evolution]]. One of the test subjects in his experiments was his 16-year-old daughter, Kole, whom he [[medical grafting|grafted]] with [[Prometheum|Promethium]].  However, instead of evolving, she found herself with the ability to create and control silicon crystal. 

Kole was then kidnapped by the mad sun Titaness, [[Thia]].  For two years, Thia forced Kole to use her powers to construct a crystal prison in which Thia can hold important prisoners.  Thia eventually came into conflict with the Teen Titans... which ultimately lead to the death of the goddess and Kole winning her freedom. Lilith, a member of the Titans who has the power to tell the future, sensed the "dark clouds of destruction" around Kole and warned her that she would face a "grim future" should she return to Earth and invited her to remain in Olympus. Kole declined, electing to reclaim her life on Earth.

Now back on earth, Kole tried to reunite with her parents, only to find that her father's experiments had produced a house full of crystalline and insectoid monstrosities. When the Titans came to confront him, he had them captured and attempted to subject them with the same experiments.  Kole helped them to escape, and in the ensuing conflict, Abel and his wife Marilyn transformed themselves into insects and self-destruct the lab.  Having nowhere else to go, Kole chose to go with the Titans to [[New York City]], though she never officially joined (this fact seems to be contradicted in other later sources such as The Secret Origins of the Teen Titans in which [[Dick Grayson]] lamented how Kole was a "Titan for such a short time").

Kole was apparently killed during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' by the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s shadow demons while trying to protect Earth 2's [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]. Noted that the Crisis of Infinite Earths rewrote the origins of [[Donna Troy]], in which Thia and her fellow Titans of Myth played a major role... which means Thia never kidnapped Kole and thus how Kole met the Titans has been nullified. There has yet to be an updated origin for Kole.

After her seeming death, Kole mysteriously resurfaced a few years later, where she assisted the Team Titans against a pack of [[vampire]]s. Her powers had somehow been upgraded with the ability to [[teleportation|teleport]] from place to place at will and sense events happening miles away.  She also hinted that she isn't anything "alive". After helping the Team Titans in several battles, Kole vanished again. It was later suggested that this was not in fact the real Kole, but a puppet created by [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]. However, when an organization called The 1,000 did a data search on all the Titans, living and dead, Kole's file read "Data Inconclusive", which adds some doubt to her final fate.

==Powers==
Kole has the power "to spin" crystal, which is to create silicon crystal into independent masses...anything from a crystal "sculpture to a safety slide". She is known to encase people in crystal, effectively immobilizing them. It is not clear what happens to the crystal she spun, rather they just eventually disappear or they remain in existence has never been established (she once spun a crystal bridge to transport herself and Jericho from Manhattan to Titan's Tower in the East River, what happened to that bridge is subject to debate).

Kole also has the ability to fly, it is unclear whether this also comes from the experiments which gave her her powers, or granted to her during her tenure as Thia's slave. Later in the Titan Titans comics, Kole is seen transporting herself on a crystal carpet. Only once had Kole been seen moving through crystal (or at least the crystal she spun herself).

==In the ''Teen Titans'' animated series==

Kole appears in a Teen Titans episode bearing her name alongside [[Gnarrk]], but her powers are different. Rather than creating crystal, she literally transforms herself into it. She lives underground with Gnarrk and become friends with the Titans. [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] wanted to use her to gain more powers for himself but she was saved by The Titans and Gnarrk. They both become Honorary Titans but Kole believed she will be safe from the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] as no-one knows about her until they listened in on her conversation and located her. She is voiced by [[Tara Strong]].
