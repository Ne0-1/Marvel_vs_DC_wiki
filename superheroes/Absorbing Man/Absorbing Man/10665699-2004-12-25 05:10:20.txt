[[Image:AbsorbingMan.jpg|thumb]]'''Absorbing Man''' (given name: Carl "Crusher" Creel) is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] universe.

Mainly an antagonist of [[Thor (comics)|Thor's]], Absorbing Man was given herbs by the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] god [[Loki]] which, once ingested, gave him the power to absorb the physical properties of anything he touched.  (Thus, if he touched a steel wall, his whole body could become as hard as steel, while he could still move, think and speak; his strength also increased to the extent that he could battle such immensely strong [[superhero|heroes]] of the Marvel pantheon as Thor and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].)  If his body is damaged or shattered while in a non-organic form, he can reconstitute his body, although this takes a great deal of time and effort.

He was in [[prison]] at the time of this power transfer, and the heavy ball and chain to which he was attached also magically gained the power.  He therefore continued to carry the chain as a kind of [[mace]].

His main weaknesses are his low intelligence, making him relatively easy to outwit, and his power can be turned against him if he is tricked or forced into physical contact with a substance with an undesirably low strength.  For instance, when fighting the Hulk once, he made the mistake of breaking glass above him, causing shards to fall on him.  When he made contact with a shard, his body turned to glass and the Hulk instantly took advantage of this by punching and shattering his foe.

Creel has absorbed the properties of a number of unusual or unique substances over the course of his criminal career, including [[adamantium]], [[Captain America]]'s shield, and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'s Quantum Bands.

Although Creel is a thug and a villain, he is not wholly heartless, and usually tries to avoid killing innocent bystanders (although he has no qualms about threatening or incapacitating them).  In recent years he became romantically involved with fellow supervillain [[Titania (comics)|Titania]] (Mary "Skeeter" McPherran); they are currently married.
