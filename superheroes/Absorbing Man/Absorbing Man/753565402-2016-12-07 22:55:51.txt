The '''Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl''' "'''Crusher'''" '''Creel''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114, cover dated March 1965, created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]]. Over the years he has played a part on several Marvel Comics crossovers such as the original ''[[Secret Wars]]'' and ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]''.

Creel was given the power to take the form of any material he touched, "absorbing" the property of the material itself. Over the years the power has worked both for and against him, such as being turned into water, then mixed with dirt to become mud, or once when he became [[cocaine]] and had to reassemble himself. The Absorbing Man was given his powers by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in a plot to defeat Loki's brother Thor. During the ''Secret Wars'' storyline Creel became romantically involved with the super villain [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] and the two were linked for decades afterwards. During the ''Fear Itself'' storyline, Creel comes into possession of a divine Asgardian hammer, granting him amplified powers and turning him into Greithoth: Breaker of Wills.

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the Absorbing Man has featured in over four decades of Marvel continuity and other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[trading card]]s.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The Absorbing Man first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (Mar. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="Steele2008">{{cite book|author=Jim Steele|title=HCA Comics and Original Comic Art Auction Catalog #829|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKSE4_IM5xoC&pg=PA159|date=1 June 2008|publisher=Heritage Capital Corporation|isbn=978-1-59967-276-2|pages=159–}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the Asgardian god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with a magic potion. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escapes prison by absorbing metal from the guards' bullets and goes on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. When he escapes, he takes with him the ball and chain to which he was shackled, and uses the ball and chain as a weapon. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a worthy opponent for Thor, who is later forced to end the battle due to Loki's kidnapping of [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]. Creel then breaks into a house and attacks the occupants. Thor comes to the rescue and tricks Creel into changing his atomic structure into pure helium. Thor accomplishes this by using his hammer's powers to transform the ground's molecular makeup. As Creel is acquiring additional mass from direct contact with the Earth when this happens he ends up drifting harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114–115 (March–April 1965)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=8}}</ref>

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology after he has knocked out an Asgardian warlock and sends Creel back to battle Thor. After Creel is nearly beaten due to Thor's fighting skill, Loki transports him to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and reveals the true source of his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed to take over the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the Universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121–123 (October–December 1965)</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns on a comet and battles the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Bruce Banner had been sent to divert the comet, as it was feared it was radioactive, but the Absorbing Man leapt aboard and began absorbing the Hulk's strength. He tries to bury the Hulk under a mountain, but when the Hulk turns back to human form, the Absorbing Man is unable to support the great weight and was buried.<ref>''Hulk'' #125</ref>

However, Creel goes on to battle many other heroes, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #183–184 (May–June 1979)</ref> [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #360 (January 1997)</ref> [[Dazzler]],<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982">''Dazzler'' #18 (August 1982)</ref> the Hulk,<ref>''Hulk'' #208–209 (February–March 1977), #347–348 (September–October 1988), #457 (October 1997), ''Hulk'' Annual #18 (1992)</ref> and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #13–18 (June–November 2005)</ref> He is one of the villains who participates in the [[Secret Wars]], and also develops a romantic relationship with the super-strong villainess [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1–12 (May 1984–April 1985)</ref> The pair also join the reformed fourth version of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' #270, 273, 275 (August, November 1986, January 1987)</ref> Creel has several more battles with Thor<ref>''Thor'' #375–376 (January–February 1987); ''Thor'' (vol. 2) #14 (August 1999)</ref> (and the [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson Thor]])<ref>''Thor'' #446 (April 1992)</ref> and a skirmish with cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #5 (December 1989)</ref> Although he assisted [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] in a plan to attack [[Captain America]], when Creel learned that Crossbones intended to detonate a bomb in New York, he absorbed the properties of [[Captain America's shield]] to contain the blast, declaring that he was not a murderer.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 3) #24</ref>

Creel is later incarcerated in New York's experimental "Ant-Hill" prison called the Big House, where all prisoners are reduced in size via [[Hank Pym]]'s "Pym Particles". An escape attempt is thwarted by [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (February 2005)</ref>

The Absorbing Man escapes prison and allies with the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] as an enforcer,<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #13</ref> but finds himself opposed by Spider-Man and new hero [[Ethan Edwards]] (later revealed to be a disguised Skrull). He is briefly trapped and converted into a new form of cocaine by one of the Owl's operatives when they become frustrated with his unprofessional approach,<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16</ref> with the new drug briefly giving those who snort him a degree of his powers, but he eventually manages to reassemble himself in a sewer and goes after the Owl for revenge.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #17</ref> Spider-Man manages to defeat Creel by tricking him into running a gauntlet where he absorbs multiple objects thrown at him, culminating in Creel absorbing two different chemicals that cause him to explode.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #18</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Creel and Titania encounter two of the divine hammers that contain the essences of the Worthy, generals to Odin's brother and adversary, [[Serpent (comics)|Cul Borson]]. Coming into contact with the hammers, Titania and Creel were transformed into Skirn: Breaker of Men<ref name="FearItself#2">{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=Stuart Immonen|inker=Wade von Grawbadger|story=The Worthy|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=2|date=July 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> and Greithoth: Breaker of Wills,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Christos Gage|penciller=[[Tom Raney]]|inker=Scott Hanna and Andrew Hennessy|story=No Unwounded Soldiers|title=[[Avengers Academy]]|volume=1|issue=15|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> respectively. They later went on a rampage depicted in a number of "Fear Itself" tie-in books, most prominently ''Avengers Academy'' #15–19 and ''[[Iron Man 2.0]]'' #5–6, as well as that storyline's core miniseries.

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Absorbing Man appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> He is briefly converted to heroism when everyone on the island experiences a moral inversion as [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] attempt to bring out the [[Charles Xavier]] in Red Skull, joining the new Astonishing Avengers assembled by Steve Rogers and Spider-Man to oppose the inverted heroes.<ref name="Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6"/> Absorbing Man later reverts to villainy when the inversion is undone.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref>

When Absorbing Man and Titania were robbing an armored car, the [[Jane Foster (comics)|female Thor]] appeared to thwart their plans. Upon meeting the female Thor, Creel mocked her for being a woman and for having taken Thor's name for herself, which she answered by breaking his jaw. Titania then appeared to confront her. But in respect for what she was doing, she knocked out her husband with his own weapon and surrendered.<ref>''Thor'' (vol. 4) #5</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline of 2015, Absorbing Man is among the villains attending [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s viewing party of the incursion between [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-1610]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1 (2015)</ref>

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Absorbing Man was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Absorbing Man into a man named Harold.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1</ref> During his time as Harold, Absorbing Man ran an ice cream parlor and was in love with Sheriff Eva. When Baron Zemo and Fixer restored the memories of the inmates, Absorbing Man joined in on their uprising with [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]. [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] members [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] arrived at Pleasant Hill to retrieve Absorbing Man. Although he was shaken from having a S.H.I.E.L.D.-induced normal life, Absorbing Man sides with the Illuminati as they work to assemble the other inmates to get revenge on S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Illuminati'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of a magical potion, Crusher Creel has the ability to duplicate the properties of anything he touches—gas, liquid, solid, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothing, and ball and chain take on the appearance and properties of titanium). If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement (although the character's first attempt at absorbing water cost Creel his sanity when he drifted apart)<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979" /> and can reform if his body is damaged in any way while in altered form, which he discovered when [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] cut his arm off during the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' while he was in a stone form and he held it in place as he deactivated his powers.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7 November 1984</ref>

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There is almost no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (April 1965)</ref> [[cocaine]];<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (Sep. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965">''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> [[diamond]];<ref name="Daredevil #360 July 1997">''Daredevil'' #360 (July 1997)</ref>  [[glass]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> [[light]];<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982" /> [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[silk]], [[soil]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #115 (April 1965)</ref> spikes;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> [[steel]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s uru hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]];<ref>''Thor'' #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> [[water]];<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979">''Avengers'' #184 (July 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself.<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965" /> Although absorbing the Sentry's power proved too much for Creel, causing him to become overloaded with energy and killing him.<ref name="Civil War 2007"/>

Creel is now also capable of combining previously absorbed abilities.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #23 (Dec. 2007)</ref>
