'''The Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl "Crusher" Creel'''), a [[fictional character]] that appears in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The Absorbing Man was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the comic book ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' vol. 1, #114. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Carl "Crusher" Creel''' becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has laced with rare Asgardian ingredients. Discovering that he can absorb the properties of anything he touches, Creel promptly escapes and with some subtle guidance from Loki went on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a match for Thor, who after warning Creel to desist eventually transforms him into helium, which drifts harmlessly into the atmosphere. <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #114 - 155</ref>

A short time later Loki retrieves Creel from space, and then reveals to Creel how he had obtained his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent and attacks Thor on Earth once more. The battle is deadlocked until Loki transports Creel back to Asgard, and directs him to take the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions and eventually confronts [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] himself. Odin is amazed at this mortal's presumption but also horrified when he discovers that Creel is absorbing each of his offensives and becoming even stronger. Thor attempts to intervene, but Odin advises his son that he must win the day alone - having been challenged in his very throne room. Creel then absorbs the properties of Asgard itself and towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery: once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it and found they can not let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space, and do not return for some time. <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #121 - 123</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns, and goes on to battle many other heroes such as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]; [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; [[Dazzler]] and [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]]. Creel is also one of the villains selected to participate in the [[Secret Wars]] and also develops a relationship with the villianess [[Titania]], whom he later marries.

==Powers and abilities==

Crusher Creel has the power to absorb the physical properties of anything he touches. This also extends to the ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the liquid he drank took effect. For example, if Creel were to touch and hold a piece of [[titanium]], the tissues of his body and his ball and chain would take on the appearance and properties of titanium.  Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement regardless of the material he absorbs. Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed, and as such Thor is careful not to bring his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] into direct contact with him. There appears to be no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of steel <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #114</ref>, silk <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #115</ref>, bronze <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #115</ref>, rock, wood, soil <ref>Journey Into Mystery Vol. 1, #115</ref>, glass <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #121</ref>, spikes <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #122</ref>, Odin's cosmic bolt<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #123</ref>, Odin's cyclonic storm <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #123</ref>, Asgard itself <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #123</ref>, water <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #184</ref>, light <ref>''Dazzler'' vol. 1, #18</ref>, [[Uru (Marvel Comics)|Uru]]<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #376</ref>, diamond <ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #360</ref>, and cocaine <ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16</ref>.

Creel's one great weakness, however, is that like the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], he is something of a thug and not a thinker. As such, several of the heroes have outsmarted Creel -  on one occasion [[Daredevil]] allows Creel to absorb the properties of a diamond, and with the use of his radar sense attacked the flaws in Creel's diamond form, thereby defeating him.

==Alternate versions==

===Earth X===

In [[Earth X]], Creel is one of the most powerful beings in this alternate universe. He attempts to absorb something he never had before: knowledge. After absorbing the knowledge of the current [[Ultron]], he is able to remember all of the things he absorbed and to turn into them at will. With this new power, he kills most of the Avengers in Washington D.C. and is finally defeated when the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] infects him with a computer virus. Creel would later return and save the planet by becoming [[vibranium]].

===Age of Apocalypse===

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], the Absorbing Man aligned himself with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who was not above recruiting altered humans such as Creel. Creel served as a warden in Apocalypse's prison camps in the Aztec ruins of Mexico alongside [[Diablo (comics)|Diablo]]. Creel fought against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and managed to injure him, but was then killed by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] when she absorbed his powers.

==Appearances in other media==

=== Television ===

Absorbing Man made an appearance in an episode of the [[1996]] [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|''Incredible Hulk'' animated TV series]] (voiced by Jim Cummings) and faced the Grey Hulk ("Joe Fixit"). 

Absorbing Man also appears as a member of the [[Masters of Evil]] in the short-lived animated series ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]''.

=== Film ===

Although the Creel character did not appear in the [[2003 in film|2003]] [[Hulk (film)|''Hulk'' movie]], the character David Banner (played by [[Nick Nolte]]) acquired powers almost identical to the Absorbing Man. He then attempted to absorb the Hulk's power for his own, but was defeated when the Hulk's unlimited power proved too much to absorb and David lost control. He was then destroyed by General [[Thunderbolt Ross]], who used a gamma missile.
