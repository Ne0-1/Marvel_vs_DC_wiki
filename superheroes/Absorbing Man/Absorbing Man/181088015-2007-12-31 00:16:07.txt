'''The Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl "Crusher" Creel''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The Absorbing Man was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the comic book ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' vol. 1, #114. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Carl "Crusher" Creel''' was a violent boxer who used his cousin's name "[[Rockwell Davis|Rocky Davis]]" in the ring. Creel is soon a jailed criminal who later became the Absorbing Man when he drank a liquid which the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with rare Asgardian ingredients. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel promptly escaped prison and went on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a match for Thor, who eventually tricks Creel into transforming into helium, which drifts harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #114-115 (Mar. and Apr. 1965)</ref> 

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space and reveals to him how he had obtained his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent and attacks Thor on Earth once more. The battle is deadlocked until Loki transports Creel back to [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and directs him to take the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions and eventually confronts [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, and towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery: once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it and find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space and do not return for some time.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #121-123 (Oct. - Dec. 1965)</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns and goes on to battle many other heroes, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 1, #183-184 (May and June 1979) </ref> [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]],<ref name="DD360">''Daredevil'' vol. 1, #360 (Jan. 1997)</ref> [[Dazzler]],<ref name="Daz18">''Dazzler'' #18 (Aug. 1982)</ref> the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #208-209 (Feb. and Mar. 1977), #347-348 (Sept. and Oct. 1988), #457 (Oct 1997), Hulk Annual #18 (1992)</ref> and [[Spider-Man]]. <ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #13-18</ref> Creel is one of the villains who participates in the [[Secret Wars]], and also develops a relationship with the villainess [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]]. <ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1 - 12 (May 1984 - Apr. 1985)</ref> 

The pair later join the reformed fourth version of the [[Masters of Evil]]. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #270, 273 + 275</ref> Creel has several more battles with Thor <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #375 - 376; vol. 2, #14</ref> (and the [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson Thor]] <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #446</ref> ) and a skirmish with cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. <ref>''Quasar'' #5 (Dec. 1989)</ref>    

The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] during the events of ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''Civil War'' #6 (Dec. 2006)</ref> Creel, however, later appears at the funeral of [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #4 (Apr. 2007)</ref>

Creel and Titania later come into conflict with the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and her [[Skrull]] partner Jazinda after they attempt to arrest Creel's cousin [[Rockwell Davis|Rockwell "Hi-Lite" Davis]]. <ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #22 - 23</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Crusher Creel has the magical power to 'absorb'/duplicate the properties of anything he touches - gas, liquid, solid, or even energy, and physical traits from animals or superhumans. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that he was wearing when the liquid he drank took effect. For example, if Creel touches [[titanium]], the tissues of his body, clothing and his ball and chain would take on the appearance and properties of titanium.  If the object is large (eg. a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement regardless of the material he absorbs. Creel is also able to reform if his body is damaged in any way whilst in altered form.

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There appears to be no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze,<ref name="JiM115"/> cocaine,<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #16 (Sept. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm,<ref name="JiM123">''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1 #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> diamond,<ref name="DD360"/> glass,<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1 #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> light,<ref name="Daz18"/> rock, silk,<ref name="JiM115">''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #115 (Apr. 1965) </ref> soil,<ref name="JiM115"/> spikes,<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1 #122 (Nov. 1965) </ref> steel,<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' vol. 1, #114 (Mar. 1965)</ref> Thor's [[Uru (Marvel Comics)|Uru]] hammer Mjolnir,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> water,<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 1, #184 (July 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself. <ref name="JiM123"/> Creel can also now merge properties, and recently combined the attributes of the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and a [[tiger shark]]. <ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #23</ref>

Creel is also a formidable hand-to-hand brawler, but his one great weakness is that he is something of a thug and not a thinker. Several heroes have used this weakness to outsmart him - on one occasion the hero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] allows Creel to absorb the properties of a diamond, and subsequently uses his radar sense to precisely target the flaws in Creel's diamond form.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In ''[[Earth X]]'', Creel absorbs knowledge. After absorbing the knowledge of the current [[Ultron]], he is able to remember everything previously absorbed and to turn into them at will. Thus more dangerous, he kills many Avengers. He is a major factor throughout the series, as a murderous faction seeks to reunite his body parts and bring him back to life. <ref>''Earth X'' #0-12 (Mar. 1999 - Apr. 2000)</ref>

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]", the Absorbing Man aligned himself with [[Apocalypse (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Apocalypse]], who was not above recruiting altered humans such as Creel (how Creel gained his powers in this universe, where Thor does not exist, is unexplained) Creel served as a warden in Apocalypse's prison camps in the Aztec ruins of Mexico alongside [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. <ref>"The Age of Apocalypse" story arc which ran from March to June, 1995, across 37 issues and 12 titles.</ref> <!--Is it possible to narrow this down to the actual issue(s) in which the character appeared?-->

==In other media==

* The Absorbing Man made an appearance in an episode of [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' animated TV series]] ([[1996]]) voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].
