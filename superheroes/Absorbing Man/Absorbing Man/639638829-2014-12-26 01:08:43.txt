The character first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (Mar. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with a magic potion. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escapes prison by absorbing metal from the guards' bullets and goes on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a worthy opponent for Thor, who is later forced to end the battle due to Loki's kidnapping of [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]. Creel then breaks into a house and attacks the occupants. Thor comes to the rescue and tricks Creel into changing his atomic structure into pure helium. Thor accomplishes this by using his hammer's powers to transform the ground's molecular makeup. As Creel is acquiring additional mass from direct contact with the Earth when this happens he ends up drifting harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114-115 (March - April 1965)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=8}}</ref>

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology after he has knocked out an Asgardian warlock and sends Creel back to battle Thor. After Creel is nearly beaten due to Thor's fighting skill, Loki transports him to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and reveals the true source of his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed to take over the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the Universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121-123 (Oct. - Dec. 1965)</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns on a comet and battles the Hulk. Bruce Banner had been sent to divert the comet, as it was feared it was radioactive, but the Absorbing Man leapt aboard and began absorbing the Hulk's strength. He tries to bury the Hulk under a mountain, but when the Hulk turns back to human form, the Absorbing Man is unable to support the great weight and was buried.<ref>''Hulk'' #125</ref>

An escape attempt is thwarted by [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] during the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.<ref name="Civil War 2007">''Civil War: The Return'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref> However, he later appears at the funeral of the villain [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #4 (April 2007)</ref>

Creel and Titania later come into conflict with the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and her [[Skrull]] partner [[Jazinda]] after they attempt to arrest Creel's cousin [[Rockwell Davis|Rockwell "Hi-Lite" Davis]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #22 - 23 (Nov. - Dec. 2007)</ref>

During the events of [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]], Creel joins a new version of the [[Lethal Legion]] led by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]].<ref>''Lethal Legion'' #1 - 3 (Aug. - Oct. 2009)</ref> After a defeat, Creel escapes prison and absorbs a shard of the [[magic item|artifact]] the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #32 (Dec. 2009)</ref>

He is defeated by Avengers' coordinators [[Maria Hill]], [[Sharon Carter]], and [[Victoria Hand]] after absorbing the latter's cold.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3</ref> Creel is sedated while the [[Avengers Academy]] escorts him to his prison. He manages to control his wrecking ball telekinetically and uses it to break himself free. He fights the Avengers Academy and begins to prevail. [[Hank Pym]], (one of the teachers for Avengers Academy), joins the fight. As the fight progresses, Creel begins to make cruel taunts to Hank, saying what a bad Avenger he is and how he always breaks under the pressure of handling too much responsibility. This provokes Hank to grab Creel and make them both larger, outgrowing each dimension at a time, which almost drives Creel insane. So he decides to surrender before going any further. Creel then begs Pym not to take him back to prison, because the prison guards constantly keep him sedated, so he can't absorb any material to escape. He hates being trapped in his own body in that type of manner. Pym, displaying compassion, decides to build him a specially-made prison cell that would eliminate the necessity of keeping Creel under sedation.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

During the 2011 "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Creel and Titania encounter two of the divine hammers that contain the essences of the Worthy, generals to [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]'s brother and adversary, the Serpent.

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Absorbing Man appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of a magical potion, Crusher Creel has the ability to duplicate the properties of anything he touches - gas, liquid, solid, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothing, and ball and chain would take on the appearance and properties of titanium). If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement (although the character's first attempt at absorbing water cost Creel his sanity when he drifted apart)<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979" /> and can reform if his body is damaged in any way while in altered form, which he discovered when [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] cut his arm off during the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' while he was in a stone form and he held it in place as he deactivated his powers.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7 November 1984</ref>

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There is almost no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (April 1965)</ref> [[cocaine]];<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (Sep. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965">''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> [[diamond]];<ref name="Daredevil #360 July 1997">''Daredevil'' #360 (July 1997)</ref>  [[glass]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> [[light]];<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982" /> [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[silk]], [[soil]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #115 (April 1965)</ref> spikes;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> [[steel]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s uru hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]];<ref>''Thor'' #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> [[water]];<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979">''Avengers'' #184 (July 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself.<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965" /> Although absorbing the Sentry's power proved too much for Creel, causing him to become overloaded with energy and killing him.<ref name="Civil War 2007"/>

Creel is now also capable of combining previously absorbed abilities.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #23 (Dec. 2007)</ref>

===Earth X===
In the limited series ''[[Earth X]]'', set in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] Earth-9997, Creel is also capable of absorbing knowledge, and eventually able to remember everything previously absorbed and to display any of these properties at will.<ref>''Earth X'' #0-12 (March 1999 - April 2000)</ref>

In the episode "Hulk Vs. the World," Absorbing Man escaped from the Cube (one of the four super-villains prisons on the show) using his absorbing powers. When confronted at a diner by Bruce Banner, Absorbing Man absorbed the properties of the spoon and attacked Bruce Banner turning him into the Hulk so they could battle. Hulk and Absorbing Man's battle continue in the desert. When Absorbing Man ends up absorbing a rock, Hulk manages to break him. Absorbing Man is shown in one piece as he is taken back to the Cube. When in his cell, Absorbing Man is kept in the air by powerful fans so that he can't absorb the properties of his cell. He later appears in the first full episode "The Breakout" Pt. 1 fighting the Hulk alongside Abomination after the breakout at The Cube. In the episode "Gamma World" Pt. 2, he was unleashed by Leader to absorb the properties of Mjolnir and joined Abomination into attacking Thor until Hawkeye and Hulk arrived.

In the episode "Assault on 42," Absorbing Man helps the Avengers fight the Annihilation Wave when it attacks Negative Zone Prison Alpha.

* Absorbing Man makes an appearance in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "The Skarr Whisperer,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20131031disneyxd28/|title=Listings - MARVEL'S HULK AND THE AGENTS OF S.M.A.S.H. on DISNEY XD - TheFutonCritic.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> voiced by [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]].

When Absorbing Man grabs Skaar's energy whip, he knocks down Skaar and hijacks She-Hulk's jet. When Skaar shoots down the jet and it crashes, She-Hulk wonders how Absorbing Man got out. After the jet is dragged back to the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.'s base, Hulk discovered that Absorbing Man had absorbed some gamma energy. As Hulk fights Absorbing Man, Hulk tries to warn Absorbing Man that he can lose control. Their battle ends up crashing Doc Samson's therapy with Skaar. As Absorbing Man approaches the base's reactor, he starts to absorb its energy from the reactor as he starts to lose control. Upon Hulk saying please, Skaar ends up fighting Absorbing Man and tricks him into absorbing the papers in a book where he defeats him. In the episode "Monsters No More," Absorbing Man appears as a member of Leader's Agents of C.R.A.S.H. and was the one who told Hulk about the group's adamantium-made stealth belts.

* Carl "Crusher" Creel appears in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/2014/8/21/23132/crusher_creel_to_menace_marvels_agents_of_shield.|title=Crusher Creel to Menace Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. - News - Marvel.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> In the episode "Shadows," Carl Creel was a boxer who can turn his body into whatever substance he touches. He was on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s termination list where John Garrett had faked his death in order to get Creel into [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. Creel interrupted an undercover operation where S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents Idaho, Lance Hunter, and Isabelle Hartley were attempting to procure from Roger Browning information on where a level ten 0-8-4 (an obelisk that petrifies anyone who touches it and is the first 0-8-4) was being held. During the fight, Carl Creel ends up killing Browning. When the agents fired upon him, he escapes after jumping from a window twenty-five feet high. While in a van, he contacts HYDRA agent Sunil Bakshi about the mission. Meanwhile, Skye visits Grant Ward in his prison to ask him about Creel. Ward tells Skye that Carl has been using a special communication to a high-level HYDRA Agent. Creel later attacks [[Glenn Talbot]] at a park until he is subdued by an electric attack by [[Phil Coulson|Coulson]]'s team and apprehended by the military. Coulson talks with Talbot where he mentions that the facility where Creel is imprisoned contains a weapon that HYDRA wants in its possession. Creel blends into his cell in order to take out the guards and escape. Once in the storage room of the facility, he blends into his surroundings in order to steal the 0-8-4. He ends up engaging Isabelle Hartley where she grabs on to the 0-8-4 where it causes her to be slowly petrified. Creel takes the opportunity to get away when the rest of Coulson's team arrives. Creel absorbs the tarmac surface of the road before blocking their van and causing it to crash. He next absorbs the rubber on the tires in order to steal the 0-8-4 so that he will not be harmed by its powers. In the following episode, "Heavy is the Head," Melinda May pursues Creel (who has stolen a car from someone) as Phil Coulson directs her not to engage. While waiting for a HYDRA contact at a restaurant, Creel covers up a formation that has developed on his arm as a result of handling the 0-8-4. Melinda May heads in and finds a waitress who has turned to stone upon touching Creel. After being informed by her about what happened, Coulson suspects that Creel might be losing control of his powers. This is confirmed later that night when Creel finds himself unable to fully absorb his collections. He later gets a call from Sunil Bakshi where he finds out about what happened. After he hangs up upon being instructed to head to the secondary drop site, he is approached by Raina who informs him that she is interested in the object he has stolen. Upon being shown the carbyne in her possession, he takes it while advising her not to cross Hydra. Thereafter, Coulson tracks the carbyne that Raina had equipped with a tracer. Creel meets with Sunil Bakshi in a park as Lance Hunter plans to take matters into his own hands. Creel is ordered to hand over the obelisk just as Lance Hunter fires on him. Upon absorbing the carbyne and regaining control of his powers, Creel goes after Hunter. Before he can finish off Hunter, he is taken down by Coulson who uses a special device to negate Creel's abilities. Glenn Talbot later meets with Coulson upon telling Lance to sell him out. Coulson gives Talbot a containment device holding a temporarily-petrified Carl Creel and suggests that Creel be stored someplace secure before the device that was used on him runs out of power.
