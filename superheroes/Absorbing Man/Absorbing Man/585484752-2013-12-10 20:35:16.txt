The character first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (Mar. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with rare Asgardian ingredients. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escaped prison by absorbing metal from the guards' bullets and went on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a worthy opponent for Thor, who is later forced to end the battle due to Loki's kidnapping of [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]. Creel then breaks into a house and attacks the occupants. Thor comes to the rescue and tricks Creel into changing his atomic structure into pure helium. Thor accomplishes this by using his hammer's powers to transform the ground's molecular makeup. As Creel is acquiring additional mass from direct contact with the Earth when this happens he ends up drifting harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114-115 (March - April 1965)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=8}}</ref>

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology after he has knocked out an Asgardian warlock and sends Creel back to battle Thor. After Creel is nearly beaten due to Thor's fighting skill, Loki transports him to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and reveals the true source of his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed to take over the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the Universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121-123 (Oct. - Dec. 1965)</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns on a comet and battles the Hulk. Bruce Banner had been sent to divert the comet, as it was feared it was radioactive, but the Absorbing Man leapt aboard and began absorbing the Hulk's strength. He tried to bury the Hulk under a mountain, but when the Hulk turned back, the Absorbing Man was unable to support the great weight and was buried.<ref>''Hulk'' #125</ref> But he goes on to battle many other heroes, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #183-184 (May - June 1979)</ref> [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #360 (Jan. 1997)</ref> [[Dazzler]],<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982">''Dazzler'' #18 (Aug. 1982)</ref> the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Hulk'' #208-209 (Feb. - March 1977), #347-348 (Sep. - Oct. 1988), #457 (Oct. 1997), ''Hulk'' Annual #18 (1992)</ref> and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #13 - 18 (June - Nov. 2005)</ref> Creel is one of the villains who participates in the [[Secret Wars]], and also develops a relationship with the superstrong villainess [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1 - 12 (May 1984 - April 1985)</ref>

The pair also join the reformed fourth version of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' #270, 273 + 275 (Aug. + Nov. 1986 + Jan. 1987)</ref> Creel has several more battles with Thor<ref>''Thor'' #375 - 376 (Jan - Feb. 1987); vol. 2, #14 (Aug. 1999)</ref> (and the [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson Thor]])<ref>''Thor'' #446 (April 1992)</ref> and a skirmish with cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #5 (Dec. 1989)</ref> Creel is later incarcerated in New York's experimental "Ant-Hill" prison, where all prisoners are reduced in size via [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s "Pym particles".

The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] during the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''Civil War: The Return'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref> Creel, however, later appears at the funeral of the villain [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #4 (April 2007)</ref>

In the [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]], Creel is revealed to have somehow regained his powers. He storms [[Avengers Tower]] to recover his ball and chain. He is defeated by Avengers' coordinators [[Maria Hill]], [[Sharon Carter]], and [[Victoria Hand]] after absorbing the latter's cold.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3</ref> Creel is sedated while the [[Avengers Academy]] escorts him to his prison. He manages to control his wrecking ball telekinetically and uses it to break himself free. He fights the Avengers Academy and begins to prevail. [[Hank Pym]], (one of the teachers for Avengers Academy), joins the fight. As the fight progresses, Creel begins to make cruel taunts to Hank, saying what a bad Avenger he is and how he always breaks under the pressure of handling too much responsibility. This provokes Hank to grab Creel and make them both larger, outgrowing each dimension at a time, which almost drives Creel insane. So he decides to surrender before going any further. Creel then begs Pym not to take him back to prison, because the prison guards constantly keep him sedated, so he can't absorb any material to escape. He hates being trapped in his own body in that type of manner. Pym, displaying compassion, decides to build him a specially-made prison cell that would eliminate the necessity of keeping Creel under sedation.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

==="Fear Itself"===
During the 2011 "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Creel and Titania encounter two of the divine hammers that contain the essences of the Worthy, generals to [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]'s brother and adversary, the Serpent. Coming into contact with the hammers, Titania and Creel were transformed into Skirn, Breaker of Men,<ref name=FearItself#2>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=Stuart Immonen|inker=Wade von Grawbadger|story=The Worthy|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=2|date=July 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> and Greithoth, Breaker of Wills, respectively.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Christos Gage|penciller=[[Tom Raney]]|inker=Scott Hanna and Andrew Hennessy|story=No Unwounded Soldiers|title=[[Avengers Academy]]|volume=1|issue=15|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> and went on a rampage depicted in a number of "Fear Itself" tie-in books, most prominently ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #15 - 19 and ''[[Iron Man 2.0]]'' #5 - 6, as well as that storyline's core miniseries.

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of a magical potion, Crusher Creel has the ability to duplicate the properties of anything he touches - gas, liquid, solid, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothing, and ball and chain would take on the appearance and properties of titanium). If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement (although the character's first attempt at absorbing water cost Creel his sanity when he drifted apart)<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979" /> and can reform if his body is damaged in any way while in altered form, which he discovered when [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] cut his arm off during the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' and he held it in place as he deactivated his powers.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7 November 1984</ref>

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There is almost no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (April 1965)</ref> [[cocaine]];<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (Sep. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965">''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> [[diamond]];<ref name="Daredevil #360 July 1997">''Daredevil'' #360 (July 1997)</ref>  [[glass]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> [[light]];<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982" /> [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[silk]], [[soil]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #115 (April 1965)</ref> spikes;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> [[steel]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s uru hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]];<ref>''Thor'' #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> [[water]];<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979">''Avengers'' #184 (July 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself.<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965" /> Although absorbing the Sentry's power proved too much for Creel, causing him to become overloaded with energy and killing him.<ref>''Civil War: The Return'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref>

Creel is now also capable of combining previously absorbed abilities.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #23 (Dec. 2007)</ref>
