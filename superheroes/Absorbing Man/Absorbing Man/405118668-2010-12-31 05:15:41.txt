The '''Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl "Crusher" Creel''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (Mar. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the Absorbing Man has featured in over four decades of Marvel continuity and other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[trading card]]s.

==Fictional character biography==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with rare Asgardian ingredients. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escaped prison by absorbing metal from the guards' bullets and went on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a match for Thor, who eventually tricks Creel into transforming into helium by using his hammer's powers to transform the ground, which drifts harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114-115 (March - April 1965)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=8}}</ref>

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space using Asgardian technology and reveals to him how he had obtained his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent and attacks Thor on Earth once more. The battle is deadlocked until Loki transports Creel back to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and directs him to take the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions and eventually confronts [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, and towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery: once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it and find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121-123 (Oct. - Dec. 1965)</ref>

He is defeated by Avengers' coordinators [[Maria Hill]], [[Sharon Carter]], and [[Victoria Hand]] after absorbing the latter's cold.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of a magical potion, Crusher Creel has the ability to duplicate the properties of anything he touches - gas, liquid, solid, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothing, and ball and chain would take on the appearance and properties of titanium). If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement (although the character's first attempt at absorbing water cost Creel his sanity when he drifted apart)<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979" /> and can reform if his body is damaged in any way whilst in altered form, which he discovered when [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] cut his arm off during the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' and he held it in place as he deactivated his powers.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7 November 1984</ref>

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There appears to be no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (April 1965)</ref> [[cocaine]];<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (Sep. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965">''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> [[diamond]];<ref name="Daredevil #360 July 1997">''Daredevil'' #360 (July 1997)</ref>  [[glass]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> [[light]];<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982" /> [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[silk]], [[soil]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #115 (April 1965)</ref> spikes;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> [[steel]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s uru hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]];<ref>''Thor'' #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> [[water]];<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979">''Avengers'' #184 (July 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself.<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965" />
