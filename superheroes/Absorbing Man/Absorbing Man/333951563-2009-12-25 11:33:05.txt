The '''Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl "Crusher" Creel''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (Mar. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Publication history==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with rare Asgardian ingredients. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escaped prison and went on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a match for Thor, who eventually tricks Creel into transforming into helium, which drifts harmlessly into the atmosphere.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114-115 (March - April 1965)</ref> 

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space and reveals to him how he had obtained his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent and attacks Thor on Earth once more. The battle is deadlocked until Loki transports Creel back to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and directs him to take the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions and eventually confronts [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, and towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery: once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it and find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121-123 (Oct. - Dec. 1965)</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns and goes on to battle many other heroes, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #183-184 (May - June 1979)</ref> [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #360 (Jan. 1997)</ref> [[Dazzler]],<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982">''Dazzler'' #18 (Aug. 1982)</ref> the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Hulk'' #208-209 (Feb. - March 1977), #347-348 (Sep. - Oct. 1988), #457 (Oct. 1997), ''Hulk'' Annual #18 (1992)</ref> and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #13 - 18 (June - Nov. 2005)</ref> Creel is one of the villains who participates in the [[Secret Wars]], and also develops a relationship with the villainess [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1 - 12 (May 1984 - April 1985)</ref> 

The pair also join the reformed fourth version of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' #270, 273 + 275 (Aug. + Nov. 1986 + Jan. 1987)</ref> Creel has several more battles with Thor<ref>''Thor'' #375 - 376 (Jan - Feb. 1987); vol. 2, #14 (Aug. 1999)</ref> (and the [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson Thor]])<ref>''Thor'' #446 (April 1992)</ref> and a skirmish with cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #5 (Dec. 1989)</ref> Creel is later incarcerated in New York's experimental "Ant-Hill" prison, where all prisoners are reduced in size via [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s "Pym particles". An escape attempt is thwarted by [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] during the events of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''Civil War: The Return'' #1 (Jan. 2007)</ref> Creel, however, later appears at the funeral of the villain [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #4 (April 2007)</ref>

Creel and Titania later come into conflict with the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and her [[Skrull]] partner Jazinda after they attempt to arrest Creel's cousin [[Rockwell Davis|Rockwell "Hi-Lite" Davis]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #22 - 23 (Nov. - Dec. 2007)</ref>

During the [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] storyline the character joins a new version of the [[Lethal Legion]] - led by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] - in a three issue self-titled [[limited series]].<ref>''Lethal Legion'' #1 - 3 (Aug. - Oct. 2009)</ref> He later escapes Prison and manages to absorb a piece of the Cosmic Cube.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==
Crusher Creel has the magical power to duplicate the properties of anything he touches - gas, liquid, solid or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that Creel was wearing when the potion took effect. For example, if Creel touches [[titanium]], his body; clothing and ball and chain would take on the appearance and properties of titanium. If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement (although the character's first attempt at absorbing water cost Creel his sanity when he drifted apart<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979" />) and can reform if his body is damaged in any way whilst in altered form.

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There appears to be no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (April 1965)</ref> [[cocaine]];<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (Sep. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965">''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> [[diamond]];<ref name="Daredevil #360 July 1997">''Daredevil'' #360 (July 1997)</ref>  [[glass]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> [[light]];<ref name="Dazzler #18 August 1982" /> [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[silk]] and [[soil]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #115 (April 1965)</ref> spikes;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> [[steel]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s Uru hammer Mjolnir;<ref>''Thor'' #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> [[water]];<ref name="Avengers #184 July 1979">''Avengers'' #184 (July 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself.<ref name="Journey Into Mystery' 1965" />
