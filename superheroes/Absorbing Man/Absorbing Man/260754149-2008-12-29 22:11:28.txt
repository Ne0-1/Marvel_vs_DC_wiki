The '''Absorbing Man''' ('''Carl "Crusher" Creel''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (Mar. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carl "Crusher" Creel was a boxer and later jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man when he drinks a liquid which the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] laced with rare Asgardian ingredients. Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escaped prison and went on to battle [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although he is only mortal, Creel's fantastic abilities make him a match for Thor, who eventually tricks Creel into transforming into helium, which drifts harmlessly into the atmosphere. <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114-115 (Mar. - Apr. 1965)</ref> 

A short time later, Loki retrieves Creel from space and reveals to him how he had obtained his "absorbing" powers. After being humbled by Loki, Creel agrees to act as his agent and attacks Thor on Earth once more. The battle is deadlocked until Loki transports Creel back to [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and directs him to take the city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions and eventually confronts [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] himself. Creel absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, and towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Loki and Creel are then beaten by trickery: once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it and find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space and do not return for some time.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121-123 (Oct. - Dec. 1965)</ref>

The Absorbing Man eventually returns and goes on to battle many other heroes, such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #183-184 (May - Jun. 1979) </ref> [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #360 (Jan. 1997)</ref> [[Dazzler]],<ref name="Dazzler #18 Aug. 1982">''Dazzler'' #18 (Aug. 1982)</ref> the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Hulk'' #208-209 (Feb. - Mar. 1977), #347-348 (Sep. - Oct. 1988), #457 (Oct. 1997), ''Hulk'' Annual #18 (1992)</ref> and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #13 - 18 (Jun. - Nov. 2005)</ref> Creel is one of the villains who participates in the [[Secret Wars]], and also develops a relationship with the villainess [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1 - 12 (May 1984 - Apr. 1985)</ref> 

The pair later join the reformed fourth version of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' #270, 273 + 275 (Aug. + Nov. 1986 + Jan. 1987)</ref> Creel has several more battles with Thor<ref>''Thor'' #375 - 376 (Jan. - Feb. 1987); vol. 2, #14 (Aug. 1999)</ref> (and the [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson Thor]])<ref>''Thor'' #446 (Apr. 1992)</ref> and a skirmish with cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #5 (Dec. 1989)</ref> Creel is later incarcerated in New York's experimental "Ant-Hill" prison, where all prisoners are reduced in size via [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s [[Pym particles]]. An escape attempt is thwarted by [[She-Hulk]]. <ref>''She-Hulk'' #10 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

The Absorbing Man later battles and is apparently killed by the hero [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] during the events of ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''Civil War'' #6 (Dec. 2006)</ref> Creel, however, later appears at the funeral of the villain [[Stilt-Man]].<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #4 (Apr. 2007)</ref>

Creel and Titania later come into conflict with the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and her [[Skrull]] partner Jazinda after they attempt to arrest Creel's cousin [[Rockwell Davis|Rockwell "Hi-Lite" Davis]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #22 - 23 (Nov. - Dec. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Crusher Creel has the magical power to 'absorb'/duplicate the properties of anything he touches - gas, liquid, solid, or even energy sources. This transformation also extends to the clothing and ball and chain that he was wearing when the liquid he drank took effect. For example, if Creel touches [[titanium]], the tissues of his body, clothing and his ball and chain would take on the appearance and properties of titanium.  If the object is large (e.g., a building), Creel can absorb sufficient mass to attain the same height. Creel also retains his intellect and capacity for speech and full physical movement regardless of the material he absorbs. Creel is also able to reform if his body is damaged in any way whilst in altered form.

Creel's overall power increases in direct proportion to the strength of the material absorbed. There appears to be no limit to what Creel can absorb, as he has absorbed the properties of bronze;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114 (Apr. 1965)</ref> [[cocaine]];<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #16 (Sep. 2005)</ref> Odin's Cosmic Bolt and later cyclonic storm;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref> [[diamond]];<ref>''Daredevil'' #360 (Jul. 1997)</ref>  [[glass]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121 (Oct. 1965)</ref> [[light]];<ref name="Dazzler #18 Aug. 1982"/> [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[silk]] and [[soil]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #115 (Apr. 1965)</ref> spikes;<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965) </ref> [[steel]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (Mar. 1965)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s Uru hammer Mjolnir;<ref>''Thor'' #376 (Feb. 1987)</ref> [[water]];<ref name="Avengers #184 Jul. 1979">''Avengers'' #184 (Jul. 1979)</ref> and even the properties of Asgard itself.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #123 (Dec. 1965)</ref>

Creel can also now merge properties, and recently combined the attributes of the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and a [[tiger shark]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #23 (Dec. 2007)</ref> 

Creel's power also has drawbacks, as absorbing some materials is detrimental. His first attempt at absorbing water cost Creel his sanity when he drifted apart,<ref name="Avengers #184 Jul. 1979"/> and while in diamond form the hero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] was able to use his radar sense to precisely target the flaws in Creel's diamond form and defeat him.<ref>''Daredevil'' #360 (Jul. 1997)</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]", the Absorbing Man aligned himself with [[Apocalypse (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Apocalypse]], and served as a warden in Apocalypse's prison camps in the Aztec ruins of Mexico alongside [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>"The Age of Apocalypse" story arc which ran from March to June, 1995, across 37 issues and 12 titles.</ref> <!--Is it possible to narrow this down to the actual issue(s) in which the character appeared?-->
