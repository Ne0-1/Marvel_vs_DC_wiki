The '''Gamma Corps''' are a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] [[military unit]], an [[antihero]] team and a multi-billion dollar corporation co-founded by General Johnn Ryker published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The team first appears in ''[[World War Hulk|World War Hulk: Gamma Corps]]'' #1, and was created by [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]] and Carlos Ferreira.

==Fictional history==
The Gamma Corps were selected as individuals whose lives had in some way been harmed or ruined by [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]]. Using Hulk's DNA, acquired from the scene of a battle with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], these people were transformed into gamma-irradiated [[supersoldier]]s. The team was assembled by [[John Ryker|General Ryker]] with the objective of destroying the Hulk.

According to the Marvel previews, they are armed with a variety of military weapons and have been trained to destroy the Hulk. Gideon, Grey and Mess are in the group because they hold the Hulk responsible for the loss of their loved ones, while Griffin and Prodigy hold more personal grudges against the green goliath.

Their first mission involved tracking down the failed Hulk-copy experiment, Private Benjamin Tibbits (AKA [[Flux (comics)|Flux]]) and killing him.

They later appeared in ''[[World War Hulk]]''. After failing to defeat the Hulk, the Gamma Corps discovered that he was not directly responsible for their individual situations and decided to go after the people who were, the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].

The Gamma Corps return in the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)#Dark Reign: Made Men|Dark Reign: Made Men]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12429 |title=Dark Reign: Made Men One Shot (2009) #1 &#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>

===Membership===
* '''Grey''' - Lieutenant Brian Talbot is the younger brother of Colonel [[Glenn Talbot]]. Created with Hulk and Leader's DNA. Trained in martial arts. The Leader DNA doesn't make him as smart as Prodigy but he's a brilliant military strategist and it seems to have been meant as a way to prevent him from losing control.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=117799 Know Your Gamma Corps: Grey - Newsarama<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Brian was often bullied and beaten by his older brother, and had actually been delighted to hear of his death. He claimed he joined the Gamma Corps because the Hulk was dangerous but really it was to do what Glenn couldn't: destroy the Hulk. During battle with the Hulk, the Leader DNA failsafe failed due to the Hulk taunting with his true reasons for fighting. This sent Grey on a rampage.

* '''[[Clown (comics)#Eliot Franklin|Griffin]]''' - Private First Class Eliot Franklin, formerly Clown of the [[Circus of Crime]]. A [[Betty Ross#Harpy|Harpy]]-like man based on the Betty Ross mutation.<ref name="See [http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=7195 Marvel Universe.com catalog: Gamma Corps #2]">See [http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=7195  Marvel Universe.com catalog: Gamma Corps #2]</ref> He has sharp claws and talons, and can spit slimy corrosive venom. He is shown to be somewhat mentally unstable, and apparently joined because he just wants someone to be mad at. This Griffin should not be confused with [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Johnny Horton]] who also has the name.

* '''Mess''' - Corporal Nicole Martin is an [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]-like red-haired woman.<ref name="See [http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=7195 Marvel Universe.com catalog: Gamma Corps #2]">See [http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=7195  Marvel Universe.com catalog: Gamma Corps #2]</ref> She and her son were caught in the sidelines of a battle between Hulk and Abomination. Consequently, her son burned to death in a car fire, and she was left badly scarred. Parts of her body were replaced with parts cloned from Abomination. While her Abomination parts possess superhuman qualities, her human parts retain normal human strength and durability. She is skilled at marksmanship and is the most well-trained member of the team. She later discovered that it was the Abomination who caused the accident, not the Hulk.

* '''Mister Gideon''' - Master Sergeant Gideon Wilson is the father of [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] (and presumably the older brother of [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]]). He blames the Hulk for his son's death. A muscular African-American man similar to [[Doc Samson]].<ref name="See [http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=7195 Marvel Universe.com catalog: Gamma Corps #2]">See [http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=7195  Marvel Universe.com catalog: Gamma Corps #2]</ref> He is armed with a pair of titanium knuckles. When the Hulk seemed to be defeated, he realized that it wasn't what he wanted after all. He originally blamed Hulk for his son's death, but the Hulk pointed out that while he (as Banner) had refused a blood transfusion to Jim out of fear he'd become a Hulk as well, Jim died of AIDS. Furthermore, Jim had him believing he was an orphan for years. Gideon realized his hatred was actually self-directed, and he later offered some words of advice to the Hulk about his own revenge pursuits.

* '''Prodigy''': Private Timothy Wilkerson is turned into Prodigy where he was created using the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]'s DNA and artificially aged. While he was still in the womb, his mother was frightened by the Hulk's appearance and suffered a stroke that adversely affected her son's development (he later discovered that the real cause of his condition was his mother taking [[heroin]] while she was pregnant). He is responsible for creating the team's equipment. He has limited telepathic abilities and can project psychic blasts.

==Gamma Corps: Black==
Some time later, Ryker (under the auspices of [[Norman Osborn]]) created a new Gamma Corps, composed of female "volunteers" (mentally unstable ex-soldiers on death row) for the ''Origins Corporation'''s gene therapy program, and sent them to capture [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|the new She-Hulk]], so that her DNA could be harvested.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #601</ref> They killed Lyra's fellow [[A.R.M.O.R.]] agents and took her computer, Boudicca, from her, which drove her to hunt them down, first killing Morass by drying out her body.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' 602</ref> The remaining two ran to a small town, attempting to hold the people hostage in order to make Lyra surrender.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #603</ref> In the ensuing battle, Lyra badly wounded Aberration, causing her body to mutate into a tumorous mess, before finally killing her with a pipe to the head. Axon then threatened to electrocute all the townspeople unless Lyra surrendered.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #604</ref> Axon absorbed most of Lyra's bioelectric energy, absorbing her powers. Lyra then made Axon angry, causing the stolen powers to weaken, and defeated her. Ryker’s men then killed Axon by remote.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #605</ref>

===Membership===
* '''Aberration''' - Private Rana Philips is another Abomination/human experiment that is similar to Mess, but with the end result being more akin to a svelte version of the Abomination. Her commanding officer used her as a scapegoat for his torture of prisoners, leading her to kill him, and be sentenced to death herself, leaving her open for the chance to be altered by Ryker instead.

* '''Axon''' - Staff Sergeant Erin Cicero is a human/[[Zzzax]] creation. Following a military skirmish, she suffered [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], leaving her so paranoid that she believed everyone around her was an enemy agent, leading her to kill her squad, and even her family. She too was sentenced to death, and given the choice to be part of Ryker's experiments instead. Axon is the most vicious of the group, electrocuting a wounded [[A.R.M.O.R.]] agent just for the sheer fun of it.

* '''Morass''' - A human/[[Glob (comics)|Glob]] fusion.
