The Wendigo is a fictional character in Marvel comics that is based on the mythical creature of the [[wendigo|same name]]. The Wendigo first appeared in the ''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 1 #162. The only way to stop it is to neutralize it with magic. Although the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] were able to pound it into submission fairly quickly, it would simply have recovered and continued its activities until the curse was lifted. However, it does appear that [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] was able to hunt and kill a Wendigo, as he managed to skin one. 

==Character biography==

Several people have been afflicted with the curse that brings about this condition including '''Paul Cartier''', '''Georges Baptiste''', '''Francois Lartigue''', and most recently a [[sorcerer]] named '''Mauvais'''. The curse is regional to the woods of [[Northern Canada]] and takes place when a person engages in [[cannibalism]]. Under the right conditions such a person becomes the Wendigo and roams the woods eating people. The Wendigo has frequently fought the Hulk, Wolverine, and [[Alpha Flight]].

==Powers and abilities==

The Wendigo possesses a variety of superhuman physical abilities as a result of a mystical [[curse]].  The curse causes anyone that ingests the flesh of another human, while within the wilderness, to transform into the Wendigo. 

The Wendigo possesses vast superhuman physical strength of an unknown limit.  It is known that the Wendigo possesses sufficient strength to go toe to toe with the Incredible Hulk, while the Hulk is in an enraged state, indicating the Wendigo can lift well in excess of 100 [[tons| ton]].

Aside from its vast strength, the [[tissues| tissue]] of the Wendigo's body are considerably stronger than those of a human being.  A Wendigo's body can resist high [[caliber]] [[machine gun]] shells without sustaining injury.  If a Wendigo is injured, it can recover from the physical trauma with tremendous speed and efficiency.  The dense fur covering the Wendigo's body grants it immunity to the harsh conditions of the extreme cold weather common in the areas in which the Wendigo has appeared.  The Wendigo can be rendered unconscious by sufficient force, such as severe physical injury and trauma, but it can only die if its heart is removed from its body.

Despite the Wendigo's great size, it can run at speeds greater than that of an [[Olympic]] level athlete.  At top speed, a Wendigo can move at roughly 50 miles per hour.  The enhanced [[muscles| musculature]] of the Wendigo generates less [[lactic acid]] than the muscles of a human being, granting it superhuman levels of stamina.

The tips of the Wendigo's fingers and toes are tipped with razor sharp, retractable claws that are capable of piercing through most conventional materials, even steel, due to a combination of the sharpness of the claws and the Wendigo's massive physical strength.

Even though the Wendigo was once a human being, very little is left of that person with the exception of brief and rare instances during which the Wendigo is able to remember things about its former life.  It is also relatively unintelligent and lacks the ability to speak, except its own name.
