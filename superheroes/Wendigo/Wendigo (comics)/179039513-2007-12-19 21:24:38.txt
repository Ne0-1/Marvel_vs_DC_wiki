The '''Wen-Di-Go''' (or more commonly: '''Wendigo''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. He is based on the mythical creature of the [[wendigo|same name]]. The Wendigo first appeared in the ''Incredible Hulk''  #162.
 
==Fictional character biography==
Several people have been afflicted with the curse of the Wendigo,  including '''Paul Cartier''', '''Georges Baptiste''', '''Francois Lartigue''', '''Lorenzo''' and most recently a [[Sorcerer (person)|sorcerer]] named '''[[Mauvais (comics)|Mauvais]]'''. The curse is regional to the woods of [[Northern Canada]] and takes place when a person in the forests of Canada engages in the [[cannibalism]] of human flesh. Under the right conditions such a person transforms into a superhumanly strong, nearly indestructible, fur-covered monster and becomes the Wendigo and roams the woods eating human beings. The Wendigo has frequently fought the Hulk, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and [[Alpha Flight]]. One Wendigo battled the [[Werewolf By Night]] in an issue of ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''. Its most frequent appearances were in the limited series [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]: Open Season #1-4 where Sabretooth was hired to kill a Wendigo creature, and succeeds in it as well. A few years later, a new Wendigo emerges, leading to a fight with [[Wolverine]] and [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #16</ref> A local Canadian super-hero, [[Talisman (comics)|Talisman]], arrives and claims to have a magical cure for the Wendigo's condition, but [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents won't let her pass until they finally confirm her identity. After a long battle, the Wendigo is defeated by a combined attack from his two opponents, and placed into SHIELD custody.

Paul Cartier became the Wendigo in ''Hulk'' #162 and was cured in ''Hulk'' #181; Georges Baptiste became the Wendigo in ''Hulk'' #181 and was cured in ''X-Men'' #140; another person became the Wendigo in ''Hulk'' #272.

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2006}}
The Wendigo possesses a variety of superhuman physical abilities as a result of a mystical [[curse]]. The curse causes anyone that ingests the flesh of another human, while within the wilderness, to transform into the Wendigo. 

The Wendigo possesses superhuman physical strength of an unknown limit.  It is known that the Wendigo possesses sufficient strength to go toe to toe with the Incredible Hulk. 

Aside from its vast strength, the [[Biological tissue|tissues]] of the Wendigo's body are considerably stronger than those of a human being.  A Wendigo's body can resist high [[caliber]] [[machine gun]] shells without sustaining injury. If a Wendigo is injured, it can recover from the physical trauma with tremendous speed and efficiency. The dense fur covering the Wendigo's body grants it immunity to the harsh conditions of the extreme cold weather common in the areas in which the Wendigo has appeared. The Wendigo can be rendered unconscious by sufficient force, such as severe physical injury and trauma, but it can only die if its heart is removed from its body. In addition to this, consumption of the removed heart will confer all powers and even the form of the Wendigo on whomever consumes it.

Despite the Wendigo's great size, it can run at speeds greater than that of an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] level athlete. The enhanced [[muscular system|musculature]] of the Wendigo generates less [[lactic acid]] than the muscles of a human being, granting it superhuman levels of stamina.

The Wendigo's fingers and toes are tipped with razor sharp, retractable claws that are capable of piercing even the Hulk's skin, a feat usually reserved for [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]], due to a combination of the toughness of the claws and the Wendigo's massive physical strength.

Even though each Wendigo was once a human being, in most cases very little is left of the person it once was. It is relatively unintelligent and, with the exception of brief and rare instances, is unable to remember things about its former life. It also lacks the ability to speak, except for its own name. Sorcerers such as Mauvais and Lorenzo have been able to avoid this aspect of the curse, using magic to gain the power of the Wendigo while keeping their intelligence and the power of speech.

==Other Wendigo==
In ''Amazing Spider-Man''  #277, a creature called Wendigo appears. This Wendigo seemed to be a ghost-like being whose very presence in New York caused a blizzard to strike. Though the creature only makes its appearance at the end of the comic the story makes it obvious that it is stalking [[Spider-Man]] the entire time he was chasing a group of kidnappers. This Wendigo seemed to be able to change size and become invisible, it was also draconic in appearance and pale green in color.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the [[Earth X]] continuity (which is non-canonical), there appears a unique twist on the classic Wendigo. This variation of Wendigo is unlike the previous, wherein the Wendigo curse afflicts only one person at a time, but rather forms an army of Wendigo, due to the curse afflicting [[Jamie Madrox]], the Multiple Man, after he chooses to eat one of his own duplicated bodies in response to the strict rationing of food that came with the declining animal population.

===MC2===
The Wendigo makes another appearance in the [[MC2]] [[imprint]] of Marvel Comics, an alternate future featuring, among others, the children of existing Marvel superheroes.  In an issue of ''[[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]]'', the Hulk, [[Doctor Strange]], Wolverine, and Wolverine's daughter Wild Thing encounter a large number of Wendigos, which turn out to be a lost cub scout troop that had eaten its scoutmaster.  Doctor Strange is able to remove the curse from the children and remove their memory of the events.

==In other media==
===Animation===

* Wendigo appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' episode "And the Wind Cries...Wendigo!" voiced by [[Leeza Miller McGee]]. In this show, the Wendigo is a curse placed upon an Indian. When the Wendigo captured Betty Ross, Hulk and General Thunderbolt Ross had to work together to sack.

===Video games===
* The Wendigo appears in the [[X-Men (arcade game)|''X-Men'']] arcade game as the Stage 3 Boss; and  returns in the stage 7, as the second boss - of five - after [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and before [[White Queen]], on Magneto's base in [[Asteroid M]].
* It also appears as an early boss in the video game ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]''. Among the game's unlockable cut scenes is a humorous out-of-continuity moment involving the Wendigo entering a recording studio (and having trouble due to its size) and delivering its sole line ("WEN-DI-GO!") into the microphone.
