'''Wendigo''' (occasionally: '''Wen-Di-Go''') is a fictional monster in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is based on the [[wendigo|mythical creature of the same name]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
The Wendigo first appeared in the ''Incredible Hulk''  #162 (April, 1973), and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Herb Trimpe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Several people have been afflicted with the curse of the Wendigo, including '''Paul Cartier''', '''Georges Baptiste''', '''Francois Lartigue''', '''Lorenzo''', '''Mauvais''' and others.

The curse is regional to the woods of Northern Canada and takes place, under the right conditions, when a person in the forests of Canada feeds on human flesh.  This "Curse of the Wendigo" was created by the Northern Gods (also known as "the Inua") in an effort to deter human cannibalism.<ref>''Thor/Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica'', ''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1</ref> The cannibal transforms into a superhumanly strong, nearly indestructible, fur-covered monster: the Wendigo. He or she then roams the woods eating human beings. The Wendigo has frequently fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and [[Alpha Flight]]. Paul Cartier transformed into the Wendigo, battled the Hulk, and escaped.<ref>''Hulk'' #162</ref> He battled the Hulk again and encountered Wolverine,<ref>''Hulk'' #180</ref> and then battled the Hulk and Wolverine; Paul Cartier was cured as college professor Georges Baptiste became the Wendigo.<ref>''Hulk'' #181</ref> He later terrorized a snowbound group.<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' #9</ref> He battled Wolverine, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and members of Alpha Flight; the Baptiste Wendigo was captured and cured by [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #140</ref> Fur trapper Francois Lartrigue later transformed into the Wendigo, battled the Hulk when Bruce Banner stumbled across a cabin belonging to him, and [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], and was taken to be cured by Shaman.<ref>''Hulk'' #272</ref>

One Wendigo battled the [[Werewolf by Night]] in an issue of ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Its most frequent appearances were in the limited series ''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]: Open Season'' #1-4 where Sabretooth was hired to kill a Wendigo creature, ultimately succeeding.<ref>''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]: Open Season'' #1-4</ref> A few years later, a new Wendigo emerges, leading to a fight with Wolverine and [[She-Hulk]].<ref name="She-Hulk vol.4, #16">''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #16</ref> A local Canadian super-hero, [[Talisman (comics)|Talisman]], arrives and claims to have a magical cure for the Wendigo's condition, but [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents won't let her pass until they finally confirm her identity. After a long battle, the Wendigo is defeated by a combined attack from his two opponents, and placed into SHIELD custody.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

In ''King Size Hulk'' #1, it is revealed that a pack of Wendigo exist in the [[Bering Strait]] after [[Red Hulk]] is attacked by a Wendigo, attracted by his camp fire while cooking a meal. A Wendigo bites the Red Hulk on the shoulder and he bleeds hot radioactive blood. He shoots the Wendigo in chest a few times with a rifle and wounds the creature, but it uses its long tail to damage his gun's sight scope. Angered, the Red Hulk reveals he gets hotter the madder he gets and then kills one Wendigo; the others come to claim the body and eat it.<ref>''King Size Hulk'' #1</ref>

The Wendigos begin their invasion upon Las Vegas.<ref>''Hulk'' #7</ref> Bruce Banner, on the trail of the Red Hulk, witnesses the Wendigo pack hunting the Casino area's big gaming room, all crouched about a water fountain with statues. Excited near a terrified girl, he transforms into the Grey Hulk. The Grey Hulk gets help in the fight against them from [[Moon Knight]], [[Ms. Marvel]], [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] and [[Brother Voodoo]]. Knocked into some debris, later on the Green Hulk appears.<ref>''Hulk'' #8</ref> However, the Wendigos infect Hulk turning him into the "Wendihulk" who ends up attacking his fellow heroes. The heroes managed to cure Hulk and drive away the Wendigos.<ref>''Hulk'' #9</ref>

When the [[Avengers Academy]] students have an encounter with former [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] subject Jeremy Biggs, it was mentioned that Biggs' company had bought a Wendigo which killed Steve (another former Osborn subject with ice-based powers).<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14.1</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, a Wendigo was among the Alpha Flight villains gathered by Vindicator and Department H to spread the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]]'s "Unity" program and to take down Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2006}}
The Wendigo possesses a variety of superhuman physical abilities as a result of transformation by an ancient mystical [[curse]]. The curse causes anyone that ingests the flesh of another human, while within the Canadian wilderness, to transform into the Wendigo.

The Wendigo possesses superhuman physical strength of an unknown limit. It is known that the Wendigo possesses sufficient strength to go toe-to-toe with the Incredible Hulk.

Aside from its vast strength, the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the Wendigo's body are considerably stronger than those of a human being, providing it with superhuman durability.  A Wendigo's body can resist high [[caliber]] [[machine gun]] rounds without sustaining injury. If a Wendigo is injured, it can recover from the physical trauma with tremendous speed and efficiency, giving rise to the quote "strike him down and he shall only rise again". The dense fur covering the Wendigo's body grants it immunity to the harsh conditions of the extreme cold weather common in the areas in which the Wendigo has appeared. The Wendigo can be rendered unconscious by sufficient force, such as severe physical injury and trauma, but it has even been able to regenerate from being completely disemboweled, including having its heart removed from its body.<ref name="She-Hulk vol.4, #16"/> However, consumption of a removed heart will confer all powers and even the form of the Wendigo on whoever consumes it.  It is not known what effect psionic attacks would have on or against a Wendigo.

Despite the Wendigo's great size, it can run at speeds greater than that of an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] level athlete. The enhanced [[muscular system|musculature]] of the Wendigo generates less [[lactic acid]] than the muscles of a human being, granting it superhuman levels of stamina.

The Wendigo's fingers and toes are tipped with razor sharp, retractable claws that are capable of piercing even the Hulk's skin, a feat usually reserved for [[adamantium]], due to a combination of the toughness of the claws and the Wendigo's massive physical strength.

Even though each Wendigo was once a human being, in most cases very little is left of the person it once was. It possesses little intelligence and can be considered non-sentient, and with the exception of brief and rare instances, is unable to remember things about its former life.  It also lacks the ability to speak anything other than its own name, which it often will yell and repeat during its attacks. Sorcerers such as Mauvais and Lorenzo have been able to avoid this aspect of the curse, using magic to gain the power of the Wendigo while keeping their intelligence and the power of speech.

==Other Wendigo==
In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #277, a creature called Wendigo appears. This Wendigo seemed to be a ghost-like being whose very presence in New York caused a blizzard to strike. Though the creature only makes its appearance at the end of the comic, the story makes it obvious that it is stalking [[Spider-Man]] the entire time he was chasing a group of kidnappers. This Wendigo seemed to be able to change size and become invisible; it was also reptilian in appearance and pale green in color.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #277</ref>

In ''Spider-Man'' issues #8-12 (the "Perceptions" story arc), a Wendigo creature is blamed in the deaths of several children near [[Hope, British Columbia]] and terrorizing the town. Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker, is sent to take pictures during the media frenzy that follows. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], having previous experience with Wendigo creatures and having concern for the creature's welfare, comes to the town and contacts Peter Parker directly, seeking Spider-Man's assistance. Together Spider-Man and Wolverine are able to determine the real cause of death among the children. The Wendigo in "Perceptions" has an appearance very similar to other incarnations of the Wendigo, yet seems to be a different manifestation. For example, this version of Wendigo is more vulnerable to harm than those that battled the Hulk as it suffers a significant wound from a hunter's bullet, and sustains injury when struck by a car. Additionally, it does not appear very aggressive, unless provoked, nor is it interested in consuming human flesh, feeding primarily on deer. In fact, when the Wendigo comes across the corpse of a child, the creature attempts to return the body to town instead of consuming it.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #8</ref>

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the [[Earth X]] continuity, there appears a unique twist on the classic Wendigo. This variation of Wendigo is unlike the previous; while the Wendigo curse afflicts only one person at a time, an army of Wendigo is formed in this continuity, due to the curse afflicting [[Jamie Madrox]], the Multiple Man, after he chooses to eat one of his own duplicated bodies in response to the strict rationing of food that came with the declining animal population.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===MC2===
The Wendigo makes another appearance in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[imprint]] of Marvel Comics, an alternate future featuring, among others, the children of existing Marvel superheroes. In an issue of ''[[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]]'', the Hulk, [[Doctor Strange]], Wolverine, and Wolverine's daughter Wild Thing encounter a large number of Wendigos, which turn out to be a lost cub scout troop that had eaten its scoutmaster.  Doctor Strange is able to remove the curse from the children and remove their memory of the events.<ref>''Wild Thing'' #0</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Hulk Ep 10.jpg|thumb|right|The Hulk fighting Wendigo as seen in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.]]
* Wendigo appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' episode "And the Wind Cries...Wendigo!" voiced by [[Leeza Miller McGee]]. In this show, the Wendigo is a curse placed upon an Indian. When the Wendigo captured [[Betty Ross]], Hulk and [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thunderbolt Ross]] had to work together to save her.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Wendigo appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Wolverine Vs. Hulk." This Wendigo is also shown to have horns whose bite turns others into Wendigos. In this episode, Wolverine is approached by Nick Fury to take down the Hulk in the Canadian wilderness, but discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents had previously enlisted Bruce Banner to aid in capturing and curing a creature called the Wendigo when some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents fell victim to the Wendigo and became Wendigos. It was originally believed to have been created by a mystic curse, but it is later revealed that the creature is actually a S.H.I.E.L.D. super-soldier experiment gone wrong conducted by [[Nick Fury]]. With the help of Hulk, Wolverine used the formula-filled darts to cure the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' - "Wolverine vs. Hulk"</ref>

===Video games===
* The Wendigo appears in the [[X-Men (arcade game)|''X-Men'']] [[arcade game]] as the [[boss (video games)|boss]] of Stage 3. He returns in Stage 7, as the second boss of five after [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and before the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], on Magneto's base in [[Asteroid M]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Wendigo appears as an early boss in the video game ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]''. Among the game's unlockable cut scenes is a humorous out-of-continuity moment involving the Wendigo entering a recording studio (and having trouble due to its size) and delivering its sole line ("WEN-DI-GO!") into the microphone.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* In the game ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''' (based on the [[X-Men Origins: Wolverine|2009 film of the same name]]) there are super-soldier prototypes called '''W.E.N.D.I.G.O.s''' (Weaponised Experiment Neurodindritic Incident Gamma Zero). In keeping with the somewhat realistic tone of the film series, these are genetically engineered super-soldiers instead of magically cursed beings, the subjects being injected with a serum and the transformation triggered by a surge of adrenaline (Possibly similar to the trigger that creates the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. They are bosses in the Weapon X areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=January 15, 2009 12:13PM PST |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/wolverine/news.html?sid=6203227&mode=previews&om_act=convert&om_clk=previews&tag=previews;title;3 |title=Gamespot |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/forum/ps3-trophies-blu-ray-games/x-men-origins-wolverine/ |title=Forum &#124; Gaming News and Opinion at |publisher=Thesixthaxis.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>
