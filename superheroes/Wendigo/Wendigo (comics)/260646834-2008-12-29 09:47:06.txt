'''Wen-Di-Go''' (or more commonly: '''Wendigo''') is a monster in the fictional  [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is based on the mythical creature of the [[wendigo|same name]]. The Wendigo first appeared in the ''Incredible Hulk''  #162.
 
==Fictional character biography==
Several people have been afflicted with the curse of the Wendigo,  including '''Paul Cartier''', '''Georges Baptiste''', '''Francois Lartigue''', '''Lorenzo''', '''[[Mauvais (comics)|Mauvais]]''' and several others.

The curse is regional to the woods of [[Northern Canada]] and takes place, under the right conditions, when a person in the forests of Canada [[cannibalism|feeds on human flesh]]. Such a person transforms into a superhumanly strong, nearly indestructible, fur-covered monster: the Wendigo. He or she then roams the woods eating human beings. The Wendigo has frequently fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and [[Alpha Flight]]. One Wendigo battled the [[Werewolf by Night]] in an issue of ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''. Its most frequent appearances were in the limited series ''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]: Open Season'' #1-4 where Sabretooth was hired to kill a Wendigo creature, ultimately succeeding. A few years later, a new Wendigo emerges, leading to a fight with Wolverine and [[She-Hulk]].<ref name="She-Hulk vol.4, #16">''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #16</ref> A local Canadian super-hero, [[Talisman (comics)|Talisman]], arrives and claims to have a magical cure for the Wendigo's condition, but [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents won't let her pass until they finally confirm her identity. After a long battle, the Wendigo is defeated by a combined attack from his two opponents, and placed into SHIELD custody.

Paul Cartier became the Wendigo in ''Hulk'' #162 and was cured in ''Hulk'' #181; Georges Baptiste became the Wendigo in ''Hulk'' #181 and was cured in ''X-Men'' #140; another person became the Wendigo in ''Hulk'' #272.

In ''King Size Hulk'' #1, it is revealed that a pack of Wendigo exist in the [[Bering Strait]] after [[Red Hulk]] kills one and the others come to claim the body and eat it.

The upcoming ''Hulk'' #9 will feature a Wendigo invasion upon Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2006}}
The Wendigo possesses a variety of superhuman physical abilities as a result of a mystical [[curse]]. The curse causes anyone that ingests the flesh of another human, while within the Canadian wilderness, to transform into the Wendigo.

The Wendigo possesses superhuman physical strength of an unknown limit. It is known that the Wendigo possesses sufficient strength to go toe-to-toe with the Incredible Hulk.

Aside from its vast strength, the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the Wendigo's body are considerably stronger than those of a human being.  A Wendigo's body can resist high [[caliber]] [[machine gun]] shells without sustaining injury. If a Wendigo is injured, it can recover from the physical trauma with tremendous speed and efficiency, giving rise to the quote "strike him down and he shall only rise again". The dense fur covering the Wendigo's body grants it immunity to the harsh conditions of the extreme cold weather common in the areas in which the Wendigo has appeared. The Wendigo can be rendered unconscious by sufficient force, such as severe physical injury and trauma, but it has even been able to regenerate from being completely disemboweled, including having its heart removed from its body.<ref name="She-Hulk vol.4, #16"/> However, consumption of a removed heart will confer all powers and even the form of the Wendigo on whomever consumes it.  It is not known what effect psionic attacks would have on or against a Wendigo.

Despite the Wendigo's great size, it can run at speeds greater than that of an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] level athlete. The enhanced [[muscular system|musculature]] of the Wendigo generates less [[lactic acid]] than the muscles of a human being, granting it superhuman levels of stamina.

The Wendigo's fingers and toes are tipped with razor sharp, retractable claws that are capable of piercing even the Hulk's skin, a feat usually reserved for [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]], due to a combination of the toughness of the claws and the Wendigo's massive physical strength.

Even though each Wendigo was once a human being, in most cases very little is left of the person it once was. It possesses little intelligence and, with the exception of brief and rare instances, is unable to remember things about its former life.  It also lacks the ability to speak anything other than its own name, which it often will yell and repeat during its attacks. Sorcerers such as Mauvais and Lorenzo have been able to avoid this aspect of the curse, using magic to gain the power of the Wendigo while keeping their intelligence and the power of speech.

==Other Wendigo==
In ''Amazing Spider-Man''  #277, a creature called Wendigo appears. This Wendigo seemed to be a ghost-like being whose very presence in New York caused a blizzard to strike. Though the creature only makes its appearance at the end of the comic, the story makes it obvious that it is stalking [[Spider-Man]] the entire time he was chasing a group of kidnappers. This Wendigo seemed to be able to change size and become invisible; it was also draconic in appearance and pale green in color.

In ''Spider-Man'' issues #8-12 (the "Perceptions" story arc), a Wendigo creature is blamed in the deaths of several children near [[Hope, British Columbia]]. Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker, is sent to take pictures during the media frenzy that follows. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], having previous experience with Wendigo creatures and having concern for the creature's welfare, comes to the town and contacts Peter Parker directly, seeking Spider-Man's assistance. Together Spider-Man and Wolverine are able to determine the real cause of death among the children. The Wendigo in "Perceptions" has an appearance very similar to other incarnations of the Wendigo, yet seems to be a different manifestation. For example, this Wendigo suffers a significant wound from a hunter's bullet, and sustains injury when struck by a car; this version of Wendigo is more vulnerable to harm than those that battled the Hulk. Additionally, when the Wendigo comes across the corpse of a child, the creature attempts to return the body to town instead of consuming it.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #8</ref>.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the [[Earth X]] continuity (which is non-canonical), there appears a unique twist on the classic Wendigo. This variation of Wendigo is unlike the previous; while the Wendigo curse afflicts only one person at a time, an army of Wendigo is formed in this continuity, due to the curse afflicting [[Jamie Madrox]], the Multiple Man, after he chooses to eat one of his own duplicated bodies in response to the strict rationing of food that came with the declining animal population.{{issue}}

===MC2===
The Wendigo makes another appearance in the [[MC2]] [[imprint]] of Marvel Comics, an alternate future featuring, among others, the children of existing Marvel superheroes. In an issue of ''[[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]]'', the Hulk, [[Doctor Strange]], Wolverine, and Wolverine's daughter Wild Thing encounter a large number of Wendigos, which turn out to be a lost cub scout troop that had eaten its scoutmaster.  Doctor Strange is able to remove the curse from the children and remove their memory of the events. <ref> ''Wild Thing'' #0 </ref>

==Other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Hulk Ep 10.jpg|thumb|right|The Hulk fighting Wendigo as seen in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.]]

When the Wendigo captured [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], Hulk and [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thunderbolt Ross]] had to work together to save her.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}
* Wendigo appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Wolverine Vs. Hulk." In this episode, Wolverine is approached by Nick Fury to take down the Hulk in the Canadian wilderness, but discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had previously enlisted Bruce Banner to aid in capturing and curing a creature called the Wendigo.  This version of the Wendigo is originally believed to have been created by a mystic curse, but it is later revealed that the creature is actually a S.H.I.E.L.D. super-soldier experiment gone wrong conducted by Nick Fury.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===Video games===
* The Wendigo appears in the [[X-Men (arcade game)|''X-Men'']] [[arcade game]] as the [[boss (video games)|boss]] of Stage 3.

* It also appears as an early boss in the video game ''[[X2: Wolverine's Revenge]]''. Among the game's unlockable cut scenes is a humorous out-of-continuity moment involving the Wendigo entering a recording studio (and having trouble due to its size) and delivering its sole line ("WEN-DI-GO!") into the microphone.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}
