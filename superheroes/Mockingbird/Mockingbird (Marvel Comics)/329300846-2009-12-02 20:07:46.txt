'''Mockingbird''' ('''Barbara "Bobbi" Morse-Barton''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Neal Adams]], she first appeared in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #6 (June 1971).

==Publication history==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=September 2009}}
Mockingbird was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] in 1971 as a supporting character in the second [[Man-Thing]] story (as Barbara Morse); this story was delayed in publication quite some time before finally appearing in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #12 (June 1972). Because of this, she first appeared  in ''Astonishing Tales'' #6 (June, 1971) — in these early stories (issues #6-8 of the bi-monthly series), she had brown hair and was unidentifed by name.

When it was decided that ''Astonishing Tales'' was to continue the Man-Thing story, the character was identified and her hair quietly changed to blond, as it had appeared to be in Adams's artwork, and she was identified as a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. Barbara Morse had a solo story as Huntress in ''Marvel Super Action'' #1 (1976) and first appeared as Mockingbird in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #95 (July, 1980).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Born in [[San Diego, California]], Mockingbird is introduced as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operative. As an espionage agent, S.H.I.E.L.D. sends Bobbi on a mission to contact [[Ka-Zar#Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]]. With fiancé Paul Allen, she journeys to the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #6-8</ref>  The two were both scientists working on Dr. Wilma Calvin's Project: Gladiator, which developed the serum that turned their colleague, Ted Sallis, into the [[Man-Thing]].  With Ka-Zar and Man-Thing, she then battles [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], which is ultimately revealed as being led by Allen, whom she pretended to love only on S.H.I.E.L.D. orders, in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #12-13</ref> Bobbi later journeys back to the Savage Land. Alongside Ka-Zar, she battles Maa-Gorr and [[Kukulcan (comics)|El Tigre]].<ref>''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 2 #3-4</ref> Alongside [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna]], she journeys to the Savage Land once more. Alongside Ka-Zar and Shanna, she battles Grond.<ref>''Savage Tales'' Vol. 1 #8</ref> Bobbi briefly takes the identity of the '''Huntress'''. She battles the renegade S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Rico Santana.<ref>''Marvel Super Action'' Vol. 1 #1</ref>

Bobbi later assumes the identity of '''Mockingbird'''. As Mockingbird, she teams with [[Spider-Man]] to battle renegade S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Carl Delandan.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #95</ref> She then meets [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and helps him against the villainous [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], Silencer, [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], and [[Bombshell (Marvel Comics)|Bombshell]]. She and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] grow close and begin a whirlwind romance, which culminates in elopement with him.<ref>''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'' #1-4</ref>. Afterwards, Mockingbird and Hawkeye return to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], whom Bobbi meets for the first time.<ref>''Avengers'' #243</ref> With Hawkeye, [[Tigra]], [[Wonder Man]], and Jim Rhodes as [[War Machine|Iron Man]], she forms the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> Alongside the original [[Iron Man]], Hawkeye, and Tigra, she later battles [[Doctor Demonicus]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #193</ref>

===On her own===
A rift later forms between Hawkeye and Mockingbird following an incident while the West Coast Avengers had time-traveled to 1876. The [[Phantom Rider]] (Lincoln Slade) abducts, drugs, and brainwashes her into forgetting her original life and convincing her she is in love with Slade (and by implication, raping her). After breaking free of his control, Mockingbird sought revenge on the Phantom Rider, and allows him to plunge to his death off of a cliff.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #18-23</ref> She is confronted by the modern-day [[Hamilton Slade (Rangers)|Phantom Rider]]. She learns that Hamilton Slade was actually the modern Phantom Rider, and attacks Slade.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #31-32</ref>  As a result of Hawkeye not believing her protests that she was raped and used by Slade (whom Hawkeye sided with) Mockingbird leaves Hawkeye and the Avengers.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #37</ref> For a time she and ex-Avengers Tigra and [[Moon Knight]] operate as a small fighting unit. With Tigra, Moon Knight, and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]], she battled the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #3</ref> Alongside Tigra and Moon Knight, she was attacked by the Phantom Rider again.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #39</ref> Hawkeye and Mockingbird later reconcile, and Mockingbird returns to the West Coast Avengers. She later arrested the [[Digger (comics)|Digger]], causing a rift between the West Coast Avengers and the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #40</ref> Mockingbird later reconciled with the modern Phantom Rider, who was at the time possessed by the spirit of the original Phantom Rider.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #41</ref>

Mockingbird's thought patterns and personality are used by the robot [[Ultron]] to create his second robotic 'wife', [[Alkhema]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Supposed death===
Mockingbird later apparently sacrifices her life to save her husband Hawkeye from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #100</ref>

She later  seems to return as a reanimated corpse as part of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s plot to destroy the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #425-426 (10-11)</ref> She is also "seen" fighting endless battles in a hell,<ref>''[[Thunderbolts]] Annual'' 2000; ''Hellcat'' 2000 mini-series #3</ref> in which she has an opportunity to return to life but turns it down while indicating that she still has a purpose to serve in death. Many theories were considered by Hawkeye and others about how Morse ended up in Hell, such as leading the [[Phantom Rider]] off a cliff or people she may have killed in her duties as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, but she denies all of them as the reason she is there.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} She also appeared as one of the many dead characters in the mini series ''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'', alongside other known dead characters such as Gwen Stacy and [[Moira McTaggart]].<ref>''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'' #5</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
When a [[Skrull]] spaceship crash lands in the [[Savage Land]], Mockingbird is among the host of Marvel heroes who emerge from the craft, alleging to be the genuine articles who have been captives of the Skrulls for years. <ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #1</ref> Several of the heroes are revealed to be Skrulls who have disguised themselves using their shape-changing powers. At first it is not clear whether this Mockingbird is the genuine article, but she is able to tell her former husband, Clint, something that they both believe only she would know - that October 12 would have been the birth-date of their miscarried child, which convinced Clint that she is real.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #2</ref> However, when all of the "Earth heroes" on the ship are revealed to be Skrulls, Clint kills the false Mockingbird.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5</ref>. Later, when Iron Man finds a Skrull ship in orbit with all the replaced heroes, Mockingbird is revealed to still be alive and tearfully reunites with Clint.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #8</ref>

Mockingbird is shown in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

===Dark Reign===
Along with Ronin (the new identity held by Clint Barton), Bobbi is invited to join the New Avengers at Bucky's home where he offers them a place to stay and to use as a base of operations. She is one of the only members not to greet Spider-Woman in a hostile manner but also feels out of place for being gone for so long. She later helps look for Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's child.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48</ref> She had also changed her costume to fit the current century style.<ref>''New Avengers'' #55</ref> In "The Reunion" mini-series, Hawkeye follows Bobbi along on a secret mission from her past. During the course of the adventure, Bobbi drops a bomb on Clint: She never returned to reconcile with him, that was the Skrull impersonating her. The last she saw, she was asking for a divorce and no longer considers Clint her husband. <ref>''New Avengers: The Reunion'' #2</ref> After a particularly difficult mission, however, realizing how they still care for each other, but unable to forget their early breakdown, they decide to start dating again, rebuilding a new relationship by scratch, while Clint, as Ronin, joins her secret squad or [[black ops]].<ref>''New Avengers: The Reunion'' #4</ref>
