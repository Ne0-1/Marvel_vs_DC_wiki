'''Mockingbird''' ('''Barbara "Bobbi" Morse-Barton''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[West Coast Avengers]].  <!--need creators, issue and date of first appearance-->

==Fictional character biography==
Though Mockingbird was first introduced as a [[SHIELD]] agent with missions in the [[Savage Land]] with [[Ka-Zar]], she was not well known until the first [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] miniseries from Marvel.  In this series, she aids him against the villainous Crossfire.  She and Hawkeye grow close and begin a whirlwind romance which culminates in their marriage. After their wedding, Mockingbird and Hawkeye return to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], later founding the [[West Coast Avengers]] together.

A rift later forms between Hawkeye and Mockingbird following an incident while the team was scattered in time. The [[Phantom Rider]] (Lincoln Slade) drugged and raped Mockingbird, and when she broke his control she allowed him to plunge to his death off a cliff when she could have saved him.  Mockingbird leaves the Avengers and for a time she and ex-Avengers [[Tigra]] and [[Moon Knight]] operate as a small fighting unit. Hawkeye and Mockingbird later reconcile, and Mockingbird returns to the West Coast Avengers.  

In another story, the West Coast Avengers fight [[Mephisto]] and Mockingbird sacrifices her life to save Hawkeye's.  She later reappears as a reanimated corpse as part of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s plot to destroy the Avengers.  She remains a fallen heroine and one of the few Marvel characters to [[Comic book death|maintain a significant demise]]. However, Mockingbird's thought patterns and personality are used by the sadistic machine known as [[Ultron]] to create his second robotic 'wife', [[Alkhema]].

==Powers and abilities==
Mockingbird was a trained SHIELD agent, expert in several forms of hand-to-hand combat and espionage techniques. She was an accomplished acrobat.  Her favorite weapon was her quarterstaff, which can be split in two.
