'''Mockingbird''' ([[alter ego]]: Barbara "Bobbi" Morse-Barton) is a fictional [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She began as a [[SHIELD]] agent with missions in the [[Savage Land]] with [[Ka-Zar]].  Mockingbird came into prominence with the first [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] miniseries from Marvel, in which she aided him against the villainous Crossfire.  She and Hawkeye grew close and began a whirlwind romance which culminated in their marriage.
 
After the marriage of Mockingbird and Hawkeye, the two heroes returned to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  After this, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], while connected to the Titan computer I.S.A.A.C., sent Hawkeye and Mockingbird to Califonia to found the [[West Coast Avengers]]. During a time traveling caper, Mockingbird became stranded in the mid-[[19th century]], where she was mind-controlled and raped by the [[Phantom Rider]].  Once free from his mind control, Bobbi let him fall to his death off of a cliff, after which she was reunited with the rest of the time-displaced Avengers and returned to the present era.  The death of the Phantom Rider caused a rift to form between Hawkeye and Mockingbird, as her husband believed that she had violated the Avengers' policy of using only non-lethal methods.  This rift caused Mockingbird to leave the Avengers, and for a short period of time she and ex-Avengers [[Tigra]] and [[Moon Knight]] operated as a small fighting unit.  Hawkeye and Mockingbird later reconciled, and Mockingbird returned to the West Coast Avengers.  

The West Coast Avengers later fought [[Mephisto]], a battle in which Mockingbird sacrificed her life to save Hawkeye's.  She later reappeared as a reanimated corpse as part of the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s plot to destroy the Avengers.  She remains a fallen heroine and one of the few Marvel characters to maintain a significant demise. Much to the disgust of the Avengers and Hawkeye in particular, Bobbi's thought patterns and personality were used by the sadistic machine known as [[Ultron]] to create his second robotic 'wife', [[Alkhema]].

Mockingbird was a trained SHIELD agent, expert in several forms of hand-to-hand combat and espionage techniques. She was an accomplished acrobat.  Her favorite weapons was her quarterstaff, which could be split in two.
