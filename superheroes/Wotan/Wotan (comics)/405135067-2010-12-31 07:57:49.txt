'''Wotan''' was a [[fiction]]al [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and the [[archenemy]] of [[Doctor Fate]] until his recent reformation at the hand of Yahweh himself.

==Fictional character biography==

Strangely enough, the being now known as Wotan started out life as a [[Stone Age]] [[woman]] who was [[rape]]d (by someone claiming to be a servant of God, apparently).  She studied the black arts and became such a powerful [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] that she was worshiped as a [[goddess]].  She later learned how to switch from body to body and then to direct her own [[reincarnation]], eventually becoming the [[male]] being now known as Wotan.  In the [[Golden Age of comics|Golden Age]], Wotan encountered first [[Green Lantern]] and then the sorcerer known as Dr. Fate, and became Dr. Fate's archnemesis.

During the second volume of the ''[[The Spectre]]'' in the eighties, he tried to take over the body of the sorceress [[Zatanna]], but failed miserably.<ref>''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #7-8</ref>  Later on, in the early nineties, Wotan discovered the [[temple]] where the last body of the being known as [[Yahweh]] - God Himself - lay entombed, still seething with mystical power.  Wotan entered the tower with the intention of absorbing the power in that body, confronting God himself, and supplanting Him.  But he then emerged blinded, his evil having been burnt out by God's power.  Declaring that Wotan would never menace anybody again, one of Yahweh's servants spirited Wotan away so that he could begin his new life.

Physically, Wotan was a tall man with a slender build and green skin.  He had black hair and purple eyes.  He dressed in a red costume with a green cape and green boots.

==Powers and abilities==

Wotan is a master sorcerer and a brilliant scientist who has created technological wonders that are far in advance of 20th century science. Through centuries of study, Wotan has mastered the black art of sorcery, becoming powerful enough to challenge even Doctor Fate. Wotan can project powerful bolts of mystical force, fly, travel between dimensions, change shape and cast a wide range of spells. He can absorb the souls and powers of other beings, transfer his soul into other bodies, and even direct the course of his own reincarnation.
