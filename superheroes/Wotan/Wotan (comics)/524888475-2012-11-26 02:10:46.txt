'''Wotan''' was a [[fiction]]al [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and the [[archenemy]] of [[Doctor Fate]] until his recent reformation at the hand of Yahweh himself.

==Fictional character biography==
The being now known as Wotan started out life as a [[Stone Age]] [[woman]] who was [[rape]]d (by someone claiming to be a servant of God). She studied the black arts and became such a powerful [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] that she was worshiped as a [[goddess]]. She later learned how to switch from body to body and then to direct her own [[reincarnation]], eventually becoming the [[male]] being now known as Wotan.  In the [[Golden Age of comics|Golden Age]], Wotan encountered first [[Green Lantern]] and then the sorcerer known as Dr. Fate, and became Dr. Fate's archnemesis. At one point he was pulled back in time with other JSA enemies by the time-traveller [[Per Degaton]] to assist in capturing the JSA and stop them interfering in his attempt to change the events of [[Pearl Harbor]], as part of a plan to [[conquer the World]]. He was told he could deal with Doctor Fate. Wotan uses his magic aura to hold the JSA captive in caves beneath an island, however the All-Star Squadron getting involved means the plan fails. When the Spectre is released from the aura and frees the other members, Per Degaton goes back in time, thus erasing everybody's memories of this event, and returning them to their proper places.

During the second volume of the ''[[The Spectre]]'' in the eighties, he tried to take over the body of the sorceress [[Zatanna]], but failed miserably.<ref>''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #7-8</ref>  Later on, in the early nineties, Wotan discovered the [[temple]] where the last body of the being known as [[Yahweh]] - God Himself - lay entombed, still seething with mystical power.  Wotan entered the tower with the intention of absorbing the power in that body, confronting God himself, and supplanting Him.  But he then emerged blinded, his evil having been burnt out by God's power.  Declaring that Wotan would never menace anybody again, one of Yahweh's servants spirited Wotan away so that he could begin his new life.

Physically, Wotan was a tall man with a slender build and green skin.  He had black hair and purple eyes.  He dressed in a red costume with a green cape and green boots.

===New 52===
Wotan is set to appear in Earth 2 issue #9.

==Powers and abilities==
Wotan is a master sorcerer and a brilliant scientist who has created technological wonders that are far in advance of 20th century science. Through centuries of study, Wotan has mastered the black art of sorcery, becoming powerful enough to challenge even Doctor Fate. Wotan can project powerful bolts of mystical force, fly, travel between dimensions, change shape and cast a wide range of spells. His magical aura was able to hold the JSA and All-Star Squadron, even Superman and the Spectre were unable to break loose without outside help. He can absorb the souls and powers of other beings, transfer his soul into other bodies, and even direct the course of his own reincarnation.
