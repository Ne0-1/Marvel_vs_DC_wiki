'''Ding Dong Daddy''' (DDD) is the name of a [[DC Comics]] rogue.

==History==
Ding Dong Daddy had exactly one appearance in ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' #3 ([[1966]]). The President's Commission on Education asked the Teen Titans to help deal with the problem of high school dropouts. In the town of Harrison, the young heroes discovered dropouts being hired by Ding-Dong Daddy Dowd, proprietor of a custom [[hot rod]] and bike shop. Uncovering evidence that Dowd's operation was a front for criminals, the Titans went [[undercover]] as would-be high school drop-outs and exposed his schemes, and persuaded his teenage employees to return to school. This was a morality issue to stay in school.

==Other media==
Ding Dong Daddy appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animated series]] as a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. He is voiced by [[David Johansen]]. He appears in the episode "Revved Up" where he steals [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s most prized possession and challenges Robin and the Titans to race, winner take all. He has a pit crew of [[gremlin]]s that follows him around on what is essentially a giant rolling [[pit stop]], repairing his own vehicle and sabotaging the [[T-car]]. He also uses a device that disables [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]'s flight power. Besides racing the Titans, he ends up racing against [[Red X]], [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]], [[Johnny Rancid]], [[Mumbo (supervillain)|Mumbo]], [[Kitten and Fang]], [[Puppet King]], [[Mad Mod]], [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]],  [[Control Freak (TV show)|Control Freak]],and [[Adonis]]. Red X disabled the other cars allowing Robin to beat Ding Dong Daddy and win back his prized possession. Ironically, Robin shows the other Titans what is in the case, but [[MacGuffin|the viewers never learn what is in the case]].
  
In the episode "Titans Together", DDD is inside the Brotherhood of Evil base, one of the villains battling against the five Titans that escaped the Brotherhood ([[Beast Boy]], [[Pantha]], [[Mal Duncan|the Herald]], [[Más y Menos|Más]] and [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]). DDD drives his car at them, but [[Kole]] and [[Gnaark]] arrive and destroy it, sending DDD flying. He is later frozen upside-down.

==Trivia==
Ding Dong Daddy is based on legendary hot rod enthusiast/painter/pinstriper [[Ed Roth|Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]].  This is further proven by DDD's minions, the Gremlins, who are knock offs of some of Roth's creations.
