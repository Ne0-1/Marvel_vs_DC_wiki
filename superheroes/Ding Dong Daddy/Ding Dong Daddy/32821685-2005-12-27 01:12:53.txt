'''Ding Dong Daddy''' is the name of a [[DC Comics]] rogue.

==History==
Ding Dong Daddy had exactly one appearance in [[Titans (comics)|TEEN TITANS]] #3 ([[1966]]). The President's Commission on Education asked the Teen Titans to help deal with the problem of high school dropouts. In the town of Harrison, the young heroes discovered dropouts being hired by Ding-Dong Daddy Dowd, proprietor of a custom hot-rod and bike shop. Uncovering evidence that Dowd's operation was a front for criminals, the Titans went undercover as would-be drop-outs and exposed his schemes, and persuaded his teenage employees to return to school. This was a morality issue to stay in school.
