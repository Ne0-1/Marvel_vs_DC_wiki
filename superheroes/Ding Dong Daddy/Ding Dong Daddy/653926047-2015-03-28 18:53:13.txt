==Fictional character biography==
The President's Commission on Education asked the [[Teen Titans]] to help deal with the problem of high school dropouts. In the town of Harrison, the young heroes discovered dropouts being hired by Ding-Dong Daddy Dowd, proprietor of a custom [[hot rod]] and bike shop. Uncovering evidence that Dowd's operation was a front for criminals, the Titans went [[undercover]] as would-be high school drop-outs and exposed his schemes, and persuaded his teenage employees to return to school. This was a morality issue to stay in school.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #3</ref>

Ding Dong Daddy later steals the [[Arrowcar]] from [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] after [[Green Arrow]] allowed the young hero to borrow it.<ref>''Teen Titans: Year One'' #5</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Ding Dong Daddy appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' TV series voiced by [[David Johansen]]. In his appearances in the series, Ding Dong Daddy makes use of a customized [[hot rod]] equipped with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including liquid nitrogen sprayers to ice up the roads, a flight power neutralizing laser, and front-mounted snapping jaws. He also employs a pit crew of [[gremlin]]s that follows him around on what is essentially a giant rolling [[pit stop]], repairing his own vehicle and sabotaging competitors. He first appears in the episode "Homecoming, Part 2" as part of the assembled villains gathered by the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] to fight the Titans. In "Revved Up", he steals [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s [[MacGuffin|most prized possession]] and challenges Robin and the Titans to race, winner take all. Besides racing the Titans, Ding Dong Daddy ends up racing against Red X, [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]], Johnny Rancid, Mumbo, Kitten and Fang, Puppet King, [[Mad Mod]], [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]], Control Freak, and Adonis. Red X disables the other cars as a way to pay Robin back for saving his life, allowing Robin to beat Ding Dong Daddy and win back his prized possession. Ironically, Robin shows the other Titans what is in the case, but [[MacGuffin|the viewers never learn what is in the case]]. In the episode "Titans Together", Ding Dong Daddy is inside the Brotherhood of Evil base as one of the villains battling the Titans that escaped the Brotherhood. Ding Dong Daddy drives his car at them, but [[Kole]] and [[Gnarrk]] arrive and destroy it, sending Ding Dong Daddy flying. He is later frozen upside-down.
