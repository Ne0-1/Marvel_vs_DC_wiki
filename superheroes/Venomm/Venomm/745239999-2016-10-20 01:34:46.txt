Venomm was once an ally of [[Erik Killmonger]], who sent Venomm to the [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakandan]] [[Vibranium]] mines to attack the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. However, the Black Panther beat Venomm into submission.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #7</ref> Within the Wakandan prison, a man named [[Taku (comics)|Taku]] tried to establish a friendship with Venomm, but Venomm just distracted Taku so that [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Killmonger minion)|Malice]] could free him. The Black Panther returned and drove off Malice, while [[W'Kabi]] choked Venomm into submission and was then reimprisoned.<ref>''Jungle Action'' #8</ref> Taku continued to try to reach Venomm,<ref>''Jungle Action'' #14</ref> but when W'Kabi attempted to interrogate Venomm, Venomm took attacked both of them and escaped.

Venomm later lived in the Wakandan Palace alongside Taku. A CIA agent had secretly embedded a transmitter under the skin of Venomm's giant pet python Matilda, causing the Black Panther to initially think that Venomm was a spy in their midst, but when he learned the truth the Black Panther remived the transmitter from her head.<ref>''Black Panther: Panther's Prey'' #2, 4</ref> Venomm maintained a position of trust within the Wakandan Palace, where be befriended Nick Collins, the son of [[Deathlok|Michael Collins]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2 #23-25</ref> Under the command of their king, the Black Panther, all of Wakanda marched onto the land of the Jabari to punish the [[Man-Ape]] for murdering a doppleganger version of the Black Panther. Venomm was at the front lines in the midst of the army and tribal warriors, and battled Jabari tribesmen during the conflict.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 3 #49</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
