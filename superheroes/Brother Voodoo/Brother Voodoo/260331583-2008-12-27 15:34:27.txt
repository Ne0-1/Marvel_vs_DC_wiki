'''Brother Voodoo''' ('''Jericho Drumm''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[supernatural]] [[superhero]] in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #169 (Sept. 1973).

==Publication history==
Brother Voodoo starred in his own feature in the Marvel comic-book series ''Strange Tales'' #169-173 (Sept. 1973 - April 1974), and in a backup feature in the black-and-white [[horror fiction|horror]]-[[comics]] [[magazine]] ''[[Zombie (Marvel Comics)|Tales of the Zombie]]'' #6 (July 1974, in a story continuing from ''Strange Tales'' #173) and #10 (March 1975). He has gone to guest-star very sporadically in other Marvel series, into the 21st century.

==Fictional character biography==
Returning to his native [[Haïti]] (born in [[Port-au-Prince]]) after 12 years (originally nearly 20<ref>''Strange Tales'' #169 (Sept. 1973), p.11 </ref>) of education and practice as a psychologist in the [[United States]], Jericho Drumm discovers that his twin brother, Daniel, the local ''[[houngan]]'', is dying, a victim of a voodoo sorcerer who claims to be possessed by the spirit of the serpent-god [[Damballah (comics)|Damballah]]. Just before he dies, Daniel makes his brother vow to visit Daniel's mentor, Papa Jambo. Jericho does, and becomes Jambo's student. After studying under the aged houngan for several weeks, Jericho gains a greater mastery of voodoo practices than his own brother, becoming a houngan in his own right. Papa Jambo then performs a rite that summons Daniel's spirit from the dead and joins it with Jericho's own. Having fashioned a worthy successor, Papa Jambo dies. 

Taking the name Brother Voodoo, Jericho challenges the priest, who goes by the same name as his god [[Damballah (comics)#Voodoo Priest|Damballah]], and his cult. With the help of his Daniel's spirit possessing one of the cult members, Jericho removes Damballah's artifact of power ([[wangal]]), causing Damballah's snakes to turn on him and evidently destroying Damballah's cult. Brother Voodoo became Haïti's houngan supreme and champion, and establishes a sprawling mansion as a base of operations. He places the wangal in a safe, its combination known only to Brother Voodoo and his manservant Bambu.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #169-170 (Sept.-Oct. 1973)</ref>

Brother Voodoo encounters the scientist [[Baron Samedi (comics)|Baron Samedi]] and artificial zombies created by the terrorist-scientist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]];<ref>''Strange Tales'' #171</ref>  the original [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]], Mama Limbo, and the Dark Lord Cult;<ref>''Strange Tales'' #172-173; ''Tales of the Zombie'' #6</ref> and the houngan Dramabu.<ref>''Tales of the Zombie'' #10</ref> Having established himself, Brother Voodoo goes on to help other superheroes, including [[Spider-Man]]<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #24</ref> and [[Moon Knight]],<ref>''Moon Knight'' #21</ref> as well as the [[Werewolf by Night|Jack Russell werewolf]]<ref>''Werewolf by Night'' #40-41 (Sept. & Nov. 1976)</ref> 

Brother Voodoo eventually succumbs to the lure of power that Damballah's wangal represented.{{issue}} Upon Jericho's wearing it, the god Damballah takes over Daniel's soul, burns down the mansion and apparently slays Bambu.{{issue}} He travels to [[New York City]] to attempt to take over the mind and body of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme, [[Doctor Strange]], who eventually frees Brother Voodoo of Damballah's influence and re-confines the evil god to the wangal.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #48</ref> He later becomes involved with the supernatural '[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]]" operation of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]],{{issue}} and registers with the government in accordance with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].{{issue}}

===Secret Invasion===
While in [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], Brother Voodoo revealed himself to be a Skrull when he attempted to kill Cannibal, whom he deemed to be a threat. However, the two killed each other in the struggle and the discovery of 'Brother Voodoo's' true form revealed the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] to [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], allowing him time to prepare.<ref>''Black Panther'' #38</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Brother Voodoo possesses numerous mystical and quasi-physical powers derived from the loa, the spirit-gods of voodoo. He can easily enter into a trance-like state in which he does not feel the heat from fire and his skin becomes impervious to burning. He can also control flame and lower life forms. Brother Voodoo can mystically create smoke accompanied by the sound of drums. The smoke conceals his presence while he is able to see through it. He has the ability to command certain living things by a mystic sort of hypnotism, most effective over animals and plants. He can summon the loa to request transport for himself and others instantaneously if they deem it necessary to his mission.

Brother Voodoo can also summon the spirit of his brother Daniel Drumm from within his body, doubling his own strength. He can also send the spirit to possess another person's body and then has total control over their actions.

Brother Voodoo also has more mundane escapist talents, once entering Strange's building, not through magic, but through the chimney. He has extensive knowledge of voudoun (voodoo) thanks to training by Papa Jambo, as well as conventional medicine and psychology with an M.D. in psychology.

He wears a mystic medallion that serves as a focus of his powers and as a focus for his contact with his personal loas.  He has, at times, employed conventional firearms.

==Other versions==
===Fred Hembeck===
Cartoonist [[Fred Hembeck]] has a particular fascination with Brother Voodoo.  He regularly featured the character in the cartoons he drew each month in ''Marvel Age'', generally depicting him as a lame character constantly trying (and failing) to get his own series.  When Brother Voodoo finally got his own solo story in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 3 #1, Hembeck drew it, in a serious art style very different from his cartooning.

In his cartoon in the final issue of ''Marvel Age'', Hembeck claimed he had only begun mocking Brother Voodoo because he had the character confused with an "even lamer" Silver Age character, [[DC Comics]]' [[Brother Power the Geek]].

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #23 (Nov. 2005), in the [[alternate reality]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Brother Voodoo is one of dozens of superhero zombies. In the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], [[flashback]] comic book ''[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'' (July 2007), Brother Voodoo is one of the last few surviving heroes to become infected with the zombie virus.

===Supernaturals===
The four-issue, weekly [[miniseries]] ''[[Supernaturals (comics)|Supernaturals]]'' (Oct. 1998), written by [[Brian Pulido]], featured an alternate-universe Brother Voodoo leading a team composed of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], [[Werewolf by Night]], the [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]], to fight a mystically powered version of the villain [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] in a world where only magical heroes and villains existed.

===What If? Age of Apocalypse===
Brother Voodoo was one of the main characters in an alternate [[Age of Apocalypse]], first seen in the February 2007 ''What If? Featuring X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' one-shot. In this issue, Voodoo replaces [[Dr. Strange]] as the Sorcerer Supreme in the story and wears Strange's wardrobe. He battles Dormammu and helps the heroes take down Apocalypse, though Jericho himself vanishes when the Eye of Agamotto is taken away from him.
