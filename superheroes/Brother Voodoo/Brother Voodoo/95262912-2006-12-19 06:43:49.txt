'''Brother Voodoo (Jericho Drumm)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supernatural]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Len Wein]], [[Roy Thomas]], John Romita Sr., John Romita Jr. and [[Gene Colan]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #169 (Sept. 1973).

==Publication history==
Brother Voodoo starred in his own feature in the Marvel comic-book series ''Strange Tales'' #169-173 (Sept. 1973 - April 1974), and in a backup feature in the black-and-white [[horror fiction|horror]]-[[comics]] [[magazine]] ''[[Zombie (Marvel Comics)|Tales of the Zombie]]'' #6 (July 1974, in a story continuing from ''Strange Tales'' #173) and #10 (March 1975).

==Fictional character biography==
Returning to his native [[Haïti]] (born in [[Port-au-Prince]]) after twelve years of education and practice as a psychologist in America, '''Jericho Drumm''' discovered that his brother, Daniel, the local ''[[houngan]]'', was dying, a victim of a voodoo sorcerer who claimed to be possessed by the spirit of Damballah, the serpent-god. Just before he died, Daniel made his brother vow to visit Papa Jambo. Jericho visited Papa Jambo and became his student. After studying under the aged houngan for several weeks, Jericho gained a greater mastery of voodoo practices than his own brother. Papa Jambo then performed a rite that summoned Daniel Drumm's spirit back from the dead and joined it with Jericho's own. Having fashioned a worthy successor, Papa Jambo died. Taking the name Brother Voodoo, Jericho challenged Damballah and his cult and vanquished them. Brother Voodoo is now Haïti's houngan supreme and champion

==Powers and abilities==
Brother Voodoo possesses numerous mystical and quasi-physical powers derived from the loa, the spirit-gods of voodoo. He can easily enter into a trance-like state in which he is immune to fire. He can also control flame. Brother Voodoo can mystically create smoke accompanied by the sound of drums. The smoke conceals his presence while he is able to see through it. He has the ability to command certain living things by a mystic sort of hypnotism. Brother Voodoo can also summon the spirit of Daniel Jericho from within his body, doubling his own strength. He can also send the spirit to possess another person's body and then has total control over their actions.
==Other versions==
===Fred Hembeck===
Cartoonist [[Fred Hembeck]] has a particular fascination with Brother Voodoo.  He regularly featured the character in the cartoons he drew each month in ''Marvel Age'', generally depicting him as a lame character constantly trying (and failing) to get his own series.  When Brother Voodoo finally got his own solo story in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' (3rd series) #1, Hembeck drew it, in a serious art style very different from his cartooning.

In his cartoon in the final issue of ''Marvel Age'', Hembeck claimed he had only begun mocking Brother Voodoo because he had the character confused with an "even lamer" Silver Age character, [[DC Comics]]' [[Brother Power the Geek]].

===Supernaturals===
The four-issue, weekly [[miniseries]] ''Supernaturals'' (Oct. 1998), written by [[Brian Pulido]], featured Brother Voodoo leading a team composed of [[Ghost Rider]], [[Werewolf by Night]], the [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]], to fight a mystically powered version of the villain [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]].

==Trivia==
*The [[Canadian]] [[punk rock]] band Brother Voodoo takes its name from the Marvel character.
