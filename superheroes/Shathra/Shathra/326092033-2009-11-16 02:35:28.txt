'''Shathra''' is a [[Spider-Man]] villain and a character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==History==
Shathra is a [[totem]] of the [[spider wasp]], much as Spider-Man is rumored to be a totem of the spider. As spider wasps kill spiders, she escaped the astral world where she lived to find Spider-Man (Spider-Man had previously visited her world and accidentally alerted her to his presence). Her plan was to feed "the spider" to her children once she killed him. 

After a first encounter, Shathra found out who he was and assumed a human form. Calling herself Sharon, she went to [[Fox News]] and claimed to be Spider-Man's lover to draw him out and disgrace him. Spider-Man quickly came to the studio and angrily attacked her, revealing her wasp form. After an intense battle, she poisoned him with wasp venom to paralyze him. After falling into a museum exhibit, he was found by [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel Sims]] and taken to [[Ghana]] in [[Africa]]. 

There, as Peter waited in an ancient Spider Temple, Shathra tracked him, and they fought in an intense showdown. However, she was attacked by a swarm of spiders, which covered her and killed her. 

Shathra's provoking of Spider-Man was a catalyst of Peter and [[Mary-Jane Watson]], Peter's estranged wife, to reunite.

==Powers/Abilities==
Shathra is an extremely powerful foe, almost on the level of [[Morlun]]. She is very, very strong, and is very agile. Shathra also has the ability to shoot stingers out of her wrists (akin to an actual wasp), which causes her prey to be paralyzed-much as a spider-wasp actually does to a spider. Spider-Man later gained this ability during [[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]].
