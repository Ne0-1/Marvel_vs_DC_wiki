'''Shathra''' is a [[Spider-Man]] villain and a character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
Shathra is a [[totem]] of the [[spider wasp]], much as Spider-Man is rumored to be a totem of the spider. As spider wasps kill spiders, she escaped the astral world where she lived to find Spider-Man (Spider-Man had previously visited her world and accidentally alerted her to his presence). Her plan was to feed "the spider" to her children once she killed him.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After a first encounter, Shathra found out who he was and assumed a human form. Calling herself Sharon, she went to [[Fox News]] and claimed to be Spider-Man's lover to draw him out and disgrace him. Spider-Man quickly came to the studio and angrily attacked her, revealing her wasp form. After an intense battle, she poisoned him with wasp venom to paralyze him. After falling into a museum exhibit, he was found by [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel Sims]] and taken to [[Ghana]] in [[Africa]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

There, as Peter waited in an ancient Spider Temple, Shathra tracked him, and they fought in an intense showdown. However, she was attacked by a swarm of spiders, which covered her and killed her.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Shathra next appeared disguised as [[Kaine#Scarlet Spider|Kaine]]'s friend Annabelle and seduced him.<ref>[[Scarlet Spider (comic book)#Volume 2|''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2]] #24 (Nov. 2013)</ref> When she morphed into her natural Shathra form she was able to beat up Kaine, but when she tried to kill Kaine's friend Wally, Kaine [[Spider-Man: The Other#Continuity|morphed into a man-spider]] and ripped her to shreds.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2 #25 (Dec. 2013)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Shathra is an extremely powerful foe, almost on the level of [[Morlun]]. She is very, very strong, and is very agile. Shathra also has the ability to shoot stingers out of her wrists (akin to an actual wasp), which causes her prey to be paralyzed-much as a spider-wasp actually does to a spider. Spider-Man later gained this ability (temporarily) during [[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]] storyline.
