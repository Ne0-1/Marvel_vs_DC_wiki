'''Jade''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]].

Jade, also known as Jennie-Lynn Hayden (affectionately as "Jennie" or "Jen") is the daughter of Alan Scott, the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[Green Lantern]] who has also been known as Sentinel. Her brother, Todd James Rice, is also a superhero going by the name [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]].

Along with Obsidian, Jade was a founding member of [[Infinity Inc.]]. She is currently a member of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. She has worked with both the [[Justice League]] and [[Justice Society of America]]. She has been romantically linked with Hank King, also known as  [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]], and with Green Lantern Kyle Rayner.

Jade's mother, the Golden Age villain known as [[Rose and Thorn (comics)|Thorn]] was briefly married to Alan Scott, but fled upon conceiving their children, fearing she would harm them. She gave them up for adoption and were separated. Jennie-Lynn was adopted by a couple in the [[Milwaukee]] suburbs. She did not learn she had a brother until she was in her late teens. Shortly after she and Todd met they, surmising they were the children of Alan Scott, attempted to join the Justice Society. They were rejected, but joined with other children and protégés of JSA members to form Infinity Inc.

Due to her father's exposure to magical energies, she and her brother were born with metahuman powers.  Jade's powers greatly resemble those of the Green Lantern Corps: she is able to generate green energy and shape it into constructs according to her will.  Though she once lost those powers, they were restored by Kyle Rayner during his short tenure as Ion. While she was without her powers, Kyle gave her a power ring and she briefly served as earth's Green Lantern.
