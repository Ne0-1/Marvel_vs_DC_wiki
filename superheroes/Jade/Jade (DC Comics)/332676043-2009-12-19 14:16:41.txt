'''Jade''' ('''Jennifer-Lynn Hayden''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC universe]]. Known affectionately as "Jennie" or "Jen", she is the daughter of [[Alan Scott]], the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[Green Lantern]]. Her mother is Rose Canton, the Golden Age villain known as [[Rose and Thorn|Thorn]]. Jennie-Lynn has a twin brother, Todd James Rice, who is the superhero [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Cowriters = [[Dann Thomas]] | Penciller = [[Vince Argondezzi|Argondezzi, Vince]] | Copencillers = | Inker = [[Tony DeZuniga|DeZuniga, Tony]] | Coinkers = | Story = Swamped! | Title = Infinity Inc. | Volume = 1 | Issue = 46 | Date = January, 1988 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 17 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref>

Along with Obsidian, Jade was a founding member of [[Infinity Inc.]] She has worked with both the [[Justice League]] and [[Justice Society of America]], as well as most recently being a member and eventual leader of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. She was also a member of the resurrected [[Green Lantern Corps]] after given a spare [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]]. She has been romantically linked with Hank King ([[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]]) and with Green Lantern [[Kyle Rayner]]. She was the first female Green Lantern from Earth.

==Fictional character history==
===Origins===
Jade's mother Rose was briefly married to Alan Scott, but fled upon conceiving their children, fearing she would harm them. She gave them up for adoption and they were separated. Jennie-Lynn was adopted by a couple in the [[Milwaukee]] suburbs. Jennie did not learn she had a twin brother until she was in her late teens. Shortly after she and Todd met, surmising they were the children of Alan Scott, they attempted to join the Justice Society. They were rejected, but joined with other children and protégés of JSA members to form [[Infinity Inc.]]

Due to her father's exposure to magical energies, she and her brother were born with [[metahuman]] powers, although Jade's only manifested themselves when she was defending herself from being [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] as a child. Jade's powers greatly resemble of her father's: she is able to generate green energy and shape it into constructs according to her will.  Jade left her modeling career in California to pursue the field of photography in New York City, and became Kyle Rayner's roommate which they've eventually romantically involved.   She once lost those powers when she fought the Starheart, the source of her powers. Following this, Kyle Rayner gave Jade a spare power ring and battery and became Earth's first female Green Lantern and a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], both objects powered by the green of the [[emotional spectrum]] of [[Will (philosophy)|willpower]]. Her powers were eventually restored by Rayner during his first, short tenure as the god-like [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]]. Her ring eventually passed to [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]. She later discovered that she had her mother's plant manipulation powers, when she caused roses to attack a mugger. While on a date with Kyle on an alien world, she told him that her skin actually contains chlorophyll (the source of its green hue), and she can photosynthesize sunlight like a plant.

Her internalized powers function much like those of her father. She can create 'solid-light' constructs out of green energy emitted from the star-mark on her palm, and can fly. She shares his weakness to wood and cellulose, but has no need to periodically recharge her powers. When wearing her power ring, it given her a similar capability of her internal powers but requires twenty-four hours of recharge from her power battery. Her ring also has a weakness to the [[Parallax (comics)|yellow impurity]], the color of fear, which would requires her to face her phobia in order to overcome it with her strong will.

When Kyle Rayner left Earth after the violent beating of his friend [[Terry Berg]], Jade opted to come along with him; however, after several missions, Jade decided that she wanted to go back to Earth. Once back she became involved with another man and ended her relationship with Kyle (in that order). She recently served as a member and then eventual leader of the new [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].
<!--this should be expanded-->
Around this time, Jade helped [[Donna Troy]] and a collection of Titans alumni in battle against the [[Titans of Myth (comics)|Titans of Myth]].

In ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]],'' Jade and her father assisted the Guardians of the Universe and the Green Lantern Corps in defeating and imprisoning the parasitic fear entity [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]].

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[Donna Troy]] led a group of Earth's heroes, including Jade, into space, where they try to deal with a growing rift in space. The Green Lantern Corps, represented by Kyle Rayner and [[Kilowog]], also responded to this threat.

In the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War|Rann-Thanagar War Infinite Crisis Special]]'', Jen died trying to stop [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from tearing the universe into a Multiverse. Her consciousness lingered within her power until her Starheart powers merged with Kyle. This merge awakened the slumbering [[Ion (comics)|Ion entity]] that Kyle unknowingly had within him, and subsequently made him much more powerful.

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later|One year after the Infinite Crisis]], Alan Scott lies in a coma after an attack by the [[Gentleman Ghost]]. The original Jade appears to him to say goodbye. She grants her father another portion of her green energy, which replaces his lost eye. It had been lost during a [[Adam Strange|Zeta Beam]] malfunction during the [[Infinite Crisis]].<ref>''JSA'' #83-85, May-July 2006, DC Comics</ref>

As part of the "Origins and Omens" backup event, which hints at future events in several DC titles, an image of Jade is shown.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #32 (February 2009)</ref>

===Blackest Night===
[[Image:GreenLantern39.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Jade as a Black Lantern, menacing her former love. Art by [[Patrick Gleason]].]]
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Jade's remains are reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] after an arrival of a black ring powered by [[death]].<ref name="glc39">''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #39 (August 2009)</ref> Now a soulless undead, Jade attempts to use Kyle's affection for her against him, claiming that his undying love for Jade brought her back. However, Kyle, earlier witnessing the onslaught of the undead Black Lantern Corps on Oa, is painfully aware that the woman present isn't truly Jade, but her reanimated corpse. In rage, he tried to destroy the Black Lantern, as he sees it as an abomination and a disgrace to the memory and remains of a woman he loved. However, Jade recovers and, after capturing him, begins to torment him with the black energy constructs of [[Alexandra DeWitt]], [[Donna Troy]], his mother Moira Rayner, and herself, to remind Kyle of his past failure to save the women he was close with.<ref name="glc40">''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #40 (September 2009)</ref> Jade and Kyle's battle is interrupted by the arrival of [[Soranik Natu]]. Jade and Soranik fight (physically and verbally), with Jade making several rude comments. Eventually, Soranik just punches Jade in the mouth and activates her ring.<ref name="glc41">''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #41 (October 2009)</ref> At that moment, the Black Lantern's rings registered that their power levels had reached one hundred percent. As such, the Black Lanterns were given a new directive: to devour Oa's Central Power Battery. Completely disregarding her opponents, Jade flew off to her objective, with Soranik's hand still in her mouth. However, Kyle was able to separate them. To save the Central Battery for his fellow Lanterns, Kyle bravely sacrificed himself to stop the undead army.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #42 (November 2009)</ref>  Fortunately, despite of being critically injured, Kyle is resuscitated by Soranik and [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphires]] member Miri Riam.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #43 (December 2009)</ref>

==Alternate versions==
In Alex Ross' miniseries [[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]], Jade, now older, takes up the mantle of Green Lantern (identified as '''Green Lantern VI''' in the endnotes of collected editions) after Kyle Rayner. Jade's efforts, along with the assistance of others, allow some survivors (including herself and her father) when the United Nations drops a nuclear bomb on the climatic battle.

In ''[[Tangent Comics]]'', the Earth-9 version of Jade is an Asian woman with the power to turn her tattoos into living dragons.

===''52''===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis [[Earth-Two]], including Jade among other apparent Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but Jade is visually similar to the Jenny-Lynn Hayden incarnation of Jade.

In November 2008, it was disclosed that Earth-2's Jade is still alive, but fatherless - on her world, her father, [[Green Lantern]] (Alan Scott) is dead. Jade is a member of the Justice Society Infinity, caused by a merger between the Justice Society of America and [[Infinity Inc]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comic book)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=13 | panel=3 }}</ref>

Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Two.<ref>{{cite web

===''Manhunter''===
In the final arc of ''Manhunter'', which takes place in the future, a new Jade appears, the daughter of Obsidian. This version is an Asian teenager named after her aunt. She appears to have light-based powers and is an active super hero.<ref>''Manhunter'' #37-38</ref>

==Nicki Jones==
<!--Moved this as it was confusing talking about Jennie, then Nicki, and then talking about Jennie again in the same history-->

[[Image:Newjade.PNG|thumb|The new Jade, '''Nicki Jones''', is introduced. Art by [[Chris Batista]].]]
In ''52'' Week 11, [[Donna Troy]] is presented with evidence from one of the Monitors that she, not Jade, was supposed to die trying to stop Luthor. In ''52'' Week 29, a young woman named '''Nicki Jones''' is introduced as a member of the new [[Lex Luthor]]-owned [[Infinity, Inc.]] under the name '''Jade'''. A [[vegetarian]] graphic arts student from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], Jones possesses the ability to project glowing vines from her fingertips, the ability to fly and green energy powers. She debuts at a [[Thanksgiving]] parade only to be attacked by [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], who accuses her of trying to steal his sister's legacy.

In ''52'' Week 40, the members of [[Infinity, Inc.]], with the exception of Nicki, [[Natasha Irons]], and the recently deceased [[Skyman|Jacob Colby]] (Skyman), battle [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] and the [[Teen Titans]] and are then arrested. She then appears during Week 50 and ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]'', alongside the remains of Infinity Inc. However, the team is too scared to face [[Black Adam]] and runs off.
