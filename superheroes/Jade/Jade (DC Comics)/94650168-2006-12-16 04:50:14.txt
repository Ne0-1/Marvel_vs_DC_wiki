'''Jade''' is the codename of '''Jennie-Lynn Hayden''', a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]]. Known affectionately as "Jennie" or "Jen", she is the daughter of [[Alan Scott]], the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[Green Lantern]] who has also been known as Sentinel. Her mother is Rose Canton, the Golden Age villain known as [[Rose and Thorn|Thorn]]. Jennie-Lynn has a twin brother, Todd James Rice, who is the superhero [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]].

Along with Obsidian, Jade was a founding member of [[Infinity Inc.]]. She has worked with both the [[Justice League]] and [[Justice Society of America]], as well as most recently being a member and eventual leader of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. She has been romantically linked with Hank King, also known as [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]] and with Green Lantern [[Kyle Rayner]].

==Character history==
===Origins===
Jade's mother Rose was briefly married to Alan Scott, but fled upon conceiving their children, fearing she would harm them. She gave them up for adoption and they were separated. Jennie-Lynn was adopted by a couple in the [[Milwaukee]] suburbs. Jennie did not learn she had a twin brother until she was in her late teens. Shortly after she and Todd met, surmising they were the children of Alan Scott, they attempted to join the Justice Society. They were rejected, but joined with other children and protégés of JSA members to form [[Infinity Inc.]]

Due to her father's exposure to magical energies, she and her brother were born with [[metahuman]] powers, although Jade's only manifested themselves when she was defending herself from being [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] as a child. Jade's powers greatly resemble those of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]: she is able to generate green energy and shape it into constructs according to her will. She once lost those powers when she fought the Starheart, the source of her powers, but they were restored by Kyle Rayner during his first, short tenure as the god-like Ion. She later discovered that she had her mother's plant manipulation powers, when she caused roses to attack a mugger. While on a date with Kyle on an alien world, she told him that her skin actually contains chlorophyll (the source of its green hue), and she can photosynthesize sunlight like a plant. While she was without her powers, Kyle gave her a [[power ring]] and she briefly served as Earth's Green Lantern. 

Her internalized powers function much like those of her father,as she can create hard-light objects out of green energy emited from the star-mark on her palm, and fly. She shares his weakness to wood and cellulose, but has no need to periodically recharge her powers.

When Kyle Rayner left Earth after the violent beating of his friend Terry, Jade opted to come along with him; however, after several missions, Jade decided that she wanted to go back to Earth. Once back she became involved with another man and ended her relationship with Kyle (in that order). She recently served as a member and eventual leader of the new [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. 
<!--this should be expanded-->
In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[Donna Troy]] led a group of Earth's heroes, including Jade, into space, where they dealt with a growing rift in space. The [[Green Lantern Corps]], represented by Kyle Rayner and [[Kilowog]], also responded to this threat.

In the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War|Rann-Thanagar War Infinite Crisis Special]]'', Jen dies trying to stop [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from tearing the universe into a Multiverse. Her consciousness lingers in her power, at least until her inherited Starheart powers merged with Kyle. This transfer instigates Kyle's second metamorphosis into Ion. 

===''52''===

In ''52'' #11, [[Donna Troy]] is presented with evidence from one of the Monitors that she, not Jade, was supposed to die trying to stop Luthor.

In ''52'' #29, a young woman named Nicki Jones is introduced as a member of the new [[Lex Luthor]]-owned [[Infinity, Inc.]] under the name "Jade". A [[vegetarian]] graphic arts student from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], Jones possesses the ability to project glowing vines from her fingertips, the ability to fly and green energy powers. She debuted at a [[Thanksgiving]] parade only to be attacked by [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], who accused her of trying to steal his sister's legacy.

===One Year Later===

[[One Year Later|One year after the Infinite Crisis]], while Alan Scott was in a comatose state during an attack by the [[Gentleman Ghost]], Jade appeared to him. She told her father goodbye and granted him another portion of her green energy, replacing his missing eye (which he had lost due to complications while returning from space after the Crisis was over) with a green glowing orb that, due to its mystical origins and connection to Jade, allows him to track astral and mystical energy forms such as ghosts.

==Alternate Versions of Jade==
In Alex Ross's miniseries [[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]], Jade, now older, took up the mantle of Green Lantern (identified as '''Green Lantern VI''' in the endnotes of collected editions) after Kyle Rayner. Jade, along with her father, were one of the few characters who survived the atomic blast at the end. Jade's abilities subsequently saved a small group of characters from the blast.
