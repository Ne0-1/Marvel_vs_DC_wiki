'''Mayhem''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Brigid O'Rielly was a police detective in Manhattan, when she learned that [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] were attacking criminals in her precinct.  At first she wanted to bring the pair to justice, but eventually, she learned to trust the young crime-fighters.

Later, she took a squad of police officers to investigate a warehouse belonging to the same pharmaceutical company that was responsible for giving Cloak and Dagger their powers. Some corrupt policemen, led by Roger Falcone, exposed the other police officers to a gas to asphyxiate them.  With her dying breath, Brigid swore vengeance on Falcone.  As Brigid lay dying, Cloak and Dagger found her, and though they were too late to save the other police, Cloak surrounded her and Dagger with his darkness, while Dagger tried to revive her with her light.  When this appeared not to work, the pair abandoned her body to search for those responsible.

Though Brigid O'Rielly died, she was reborn as Mayhem, and she helped Cloak and Dagger find and fight the corrupt police, and she killed Falcone as promised.  She is now herself a vigilante, showing no mercy to the drug dealers and other criminals she pursues.

===The Initiative===
Brigid is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.
