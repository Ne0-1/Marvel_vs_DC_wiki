A fictional character from the Spider-Man universe, making her initial appearance in the 1994 Spider-Man animated series. She has long blonde hair that she keeps tied back in a pony tail and wears glasses, which may or may not mark her as a stereotypical interpretation of a nerd. 

In her first appearance, Peter Parker, AKA: [[Spider-Man]], describes Debra as being the little sister he never had or wanted. She does display a knack pestering him and often seems like a know it all, but that's only because she actually is a very bright, studious young woman. She usually didn't have a direct effect on Spider-Man's adventures or become involved in the plots, but at one point, she was a victim of the Vulture's youth sucking powers, which reduced her to a frail, fragile old woman; fortunately, the effect was not permanent, and Debra's youth eventually returned to her. 

In an archetypal opposites attract manner, Debra developed an unlikely attraction to the jockish Flash Thompson, another class mate. However, she also had a deep infatuation with Michael Morbius, but he rejected her, albeit as gently as he could, because he was with Felicia Hardy, who later became the Black Cat. Sometime after Morbius disappeared following his vampirism, Debra started dating Flash to ease the pain, letting her hair down, both physically and metaphorically, while trying to drown out her sorrows with lots of late night partying. In the end, even Flash had to put his foot down and tell Debra she had to ease up. Eventually Debra got her act together and resumed her more normal, studious life style.
