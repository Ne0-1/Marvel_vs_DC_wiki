'''Dusk''' was an identity used by several [[fictional characters|fictional]] [[superhero|superheroes]] in the Marvel Universe.  It was eventually adopted by [[Goth subculture|Gothic]] college student '''Cassie St. Commons''', who appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]' series, ''Slingers''.

==Negative Zone==
During one of his adventures, [[Spider-Man]] travelled to the [[Negative Zone]].  While there, he befriended a group of rebels battling the tyrannical [[Blastaar]].  Their leader had been a hero called '''Dusk''', who wore a completely black costume.  Dusk's name and costume had in fact been taken up by a series of people as a symbol of freedom&mdash;but the latest man to take up Dusk's mantle had been killed prior to Spider-Man's arrival.  At the rebels' request, Spider-Man wore the costume and led the rebels to victory.  When he returned to the normal universe, he still had the costume.

Later, a new Dusk took up the name and costume in the Negative Zone.

==Peter Parker==
{{main|Spider-Man}}
When Spider-Man was accused of murder during the ''[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis]]'' storyline, he donned several different costumes to continue saving lives without anyone knowing it was him.  One of the identities he adopted was that of Dusk.  As Dusk, he pretended to be a mercenary with a quiet, serious personality, and teamed up with [[Trapster]], who had in fact framed him.  When he cleared his name, he abandoned the costume.

Although the hero called [[Black Marvel]] later gave Cassie St. Commons a duplicate Dusk costume, Spider-Man remained in possession of the original.  It has not been seen since.

===Powers and abilities===
In addition to his regular [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|abilities]], the Dusk costume allowed Spider-Man to become virtually invisible in shadow, and glide short distances.

===Fictional character biography===
'''Cassie St. Commons''' was a college student at ESU who enjoyed looking different, with jet black hair, facial tattoos, and nose and tongue piercings. She was invited to join the [[Slingers]], and was presented with the Dusk costume by the [[Black Marvel]]. She accepted, but had to undertake an "initiation" into the group by making a heroic leap across the rooftop of one building and land on another. While her teammates, [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]], [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]], and [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] all had powers (or equipment) that enabled them to easily make the jump, Cassie had no powers, and when she jumped, she fell to her death.

But Cassie was reborn, no longer dead, but not truly alive. She was Dusk. She found that she could teleport anywhere in a swirl of shadows, and she had some kind of [[psychic]] awareness that enabled her to feel her teammates. When she returned, her fellow Slingers were shocked to see their friend back from the dead. But being dead didn't stop Dusk from developing a crush on Ricochet, or having Hornet fall in love with her. But she kept both boys at a distance, since she felt that they couldn't know what it was like to be alive, yet not have a heartbeat. Dusk's powers began to evolve to the point where she could use her powers to transport other people, and manipulate shadows, and she proved herself to be an invaluable ally. Her talent to sense the location and well-being of her teammates saved Hornet, when she "knew" that he was captured by a killer rat-man. When she learned that Black Marvel had been taken by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (an evil demon) she was shocked, and when she learned that her costume was given to Black Marvel by the demon, she was horrified. But Dusk used her control over the darkness to help her team free Black Marvel's soul from Mephisto when he was captured. The team disbanded, and Dusk left to discover what she truly was.

We next see Dusk in ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #18, being held captive by the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]]. Puppet Master used an improved version of his magic clay to capture various women, including female heroes and villains along with [[Stature (comics)|Stature]], [[Ara√±a]], [[Tigra]] and [[Silverclaw]], and hold them in a state of suspended animation. He intends to sell the captives off as "interactive art".

===Powers and abilities===
Dusk has many supernatural abilities. Her primary power is the ability to [[teleportation|teleport]] herself (or others) anywhere she wishes to be. She can manipulate shadows to form objects or constructs of solid dark energy, a power she used to great effectiveness during the battle against Mephisto's horde of demons. She also can regenerate damaged tissue and she has a [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] ability to sense the whereabouts of her teammates, and know if they are in danger, no matter how far away she is from them.
