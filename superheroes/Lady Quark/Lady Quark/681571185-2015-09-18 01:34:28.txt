'''Lady Quark''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the [[DC Universe]]. In the [[DC Comics]] 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985-1986), the character was one of the rulers of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#Catalogued|Earth-Six]], which was ruled by royalty. In the current [[New 52]] era [[DC Multiverse]], she and her husband Lord Volt are now the monarchs of Earth-48, which appears to be a modern analogue of Earth-Six in the original DC multiverse.

==Fictional character biography==

===''Crisis''===
Lady Quark's husband Karak ("Lord Volt") and daughter Liana ("Princess Fern") are both killed when Earth-6 is destroyed during the Crisis. She is saved at the last minute by [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]], a dimensional traveler.  Lady Quark helps most of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]]'s surviving heroes and they journey to the Dawn of Time to battle the [[Anti-Monitor]]. After the Crisis is over, Lady Quark resettles on Earth with Pariah and [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]].

Missing her husband, Lady Quark approaches [[Starman (comics)#Will Payton|Will Payton]] with the idea of having him become her consort in ''Starman'' Volume 1, #8 (March 1989), but Payton rejects her advances.

===L.E.G.I.O.N.===
Lady Quark is eventually recruited by [[Vril Dox]] to be become a member of the peace-keeping force [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '90'' #18. Lady Quark is apparently killed in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #62 after a parasitic shapeshifter absorbs her memories and powers.  The shapeshifter replaces her in L.E.G.I.O.N., but later dies in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #70. Lady Quark's corpse is seen floating in space, heavily maimed.

===Return===
Eleven years later, Lady Quark returns alive and well without explanation in ''[[Villains United]]'' #5 (2005), in which she is captured by [[Sinestro]] at the request of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]. She is imprisoned in Luthor's tower as part of his plan to bring the core Earths of the Multiverse back into existence. Lady Quark is later freed and joins Earth's heroes in defeating Luthor in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (2005-2006).

Lady Quark appears again in several splash pages of ''Tales of The Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime'' (December 2007), and again in a double page spread of Legionnaires and characters associated with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #5 (July 2009).

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] reboot of ''[[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]]'', Lady Quark is revealed to be one of [[Amanda Waller]]'s and [[A.R.G.U.S.|A.R.G.U.S]]'s interdimensional prisoners. Vibe releases Lady Quark, along with [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]], [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]], and several other formerly absent characters, and the former prisoners begin to attack Amanda Waller and A.R.G.U.S.<ref>''Vibe'' #6 (July 2013)</ref>

===Multiversity: Earth-48===
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[Multiversity]] series, Lady Quark and her husband, Lord Volt, appear as residents of Earth-48 of the [[New 52]]'s modified [[DC Multiverse]]. According to subsequent information, this iteration of Earth-48 is a fusion of the pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] Earth-Six and Warworld (52's Earth-48). Lady Quark, Lord Volt and their daughter Liana are members of Earth-48's royal family, much as they were on Earth-Six <ref>''The Multiversity 1: Hall of Heroes'' (August 2014)</ref><ref>Multiversity Guidebook: January 2015</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Quark is a [[metahuman]] with the ability to absorb and emit nuclear energies.  She can direct these energies as percussive forces from her body.  Her powers allow her to fly and travel through space. If her unexplained reappearance is taken as is, it may be assumed she can regenerate herself even from seeming death.

==Other versions==
An older version of Lady Quark becomes one half of the tyrannical ruler of L.E.G.I.O.N.<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' Annual #2 (1991)</ref>

Lady Quark is featured-along with Lord Volt-in a 'Convergence' tie-in, fighting Matrix-Supergirl.<ref>''Convergence: Supergirl:Matrix'' (June 2015)</ref> Her daughter, Princess Fern, is featured in a 'Convergence' tie-in, fighting Parralax. Fern's parents are seen on monitor screens.<ref>''Convergence: Green Lantern, Parralax'' (June 2015)</ref>
