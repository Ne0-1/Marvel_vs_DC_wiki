'''Lady Quark''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the [[DC Universe]]. In the [[DC Comics]] 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the character was one of the rulers of her home world, [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Six]] where the [[Revolutionary War]] was won by [[England]].

==Fictional character biography==
Lady Quark's husband Lord Volt and daughter Princess Fern are both killed when Earth-Six is destroyed during the Crisis. She is saved at the last minute by [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]], a dimensional traveler.  She helps most of the multiverse's surviving heroes and they journey to the Dawn of Time to battle the [[Anti-Monitor]]. 

After the Crisi is over, Lady Quark resettles on Earth with Pariah and [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]].  Missing her husband, she approached [[Starman (comics)#Will Payton|Will Payton]] in ''Starman'' (Volume 1) #8 with the idea of having him become her consort.  Payton rejected her advances. 

Lady Quark is eventually recruited by [[Vril Dox]] to be become a member of the peace-keeping force [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] (''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' #18).  During her stay with the team, an alternate time-line presents itself when Dox captures the time-traveler [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]]. Quark, Dox and Waverider then merge into a powerful, murderous dictator (in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '91 Annual'' #2 (1991)).

===Death/Rebirth===
Lady Quark is apparently killed in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #62 after a parasitic shapeshifter absorbs her memories and powers.  The shapeshifter replaces her in L.E.G.I.O.N., but later dies in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #70. Lady Quark's corpse is seen floating in space, heavily maimed. Eleven years later, she returns alive and well without explanation in ''[[Villains United]]'' #5, in which she is captured by [[Sinestro]] at [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s request. She is imprisoned on Luthor's tower; its purpose is to bring the core Earths of the Multiverse back into existence. She is later freed and joins Earth's heroes in defeating Alexander Luthor. She recently appears again in several splash pages in ''Tales of The Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime'' (December 2007).

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Quark is a [[metahuman]] with the ability to absorb and emit nuclear energies.  She can direct these energies as percussive forces from her body.  Her powers allow her to fly and travel through space.
