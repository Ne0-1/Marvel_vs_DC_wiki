In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] [[comic book]] mini-series, '''Lady Quark''' was one of the rulers of her home world, [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Six]] where the Revolutionary War was won by England. She had the ability to alter matter on the subatomic level. Her husband Lord Volt and daughter Princess Fern were both killed when Earth-Six was destroyed. She was saved at the last minute by [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]].

Lady Quark was apparently killed in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #62 and replaced by a parasitic shapeshifter, which then died in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' #70". The parasite left Lady Quark's body floating in space, however, so her death was never confirmed. Eleven years later, she returned without explanation in ''Villains United'' #5, in which she was captured by [[Sinestro]] at [[Alexander Luthor]]'s request.
