Some time after failing at this, he fought the [[Fantastic Four]].  He was later hired to kill businessmen Regis Fussky but was stopped from doing so by [[Iron Man]]/[[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]].

Most recently, Flying Tiger joined the [[Crimson Cowl II|Crimson Cowl's]] [[Masters of Evil]].  The group's plot to blackmail the governments of the world using a weather-controlling machine was stopped by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

Later in San Francisco, Flying Tiger was defeated by [[Armory (comics)|Armory]]. <ref>Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1/2</ref>
