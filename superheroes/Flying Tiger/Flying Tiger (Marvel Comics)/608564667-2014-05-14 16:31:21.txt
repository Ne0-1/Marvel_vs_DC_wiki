Flying Tiger's true identity is unknown. A professional football player whose career was cut short, he developed a costume that enabled him to fly. He started his criminal career as a mercenary assassin when he was hired to kill the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #40</ref>

Flying Tiger was among the superhuman individuals that were abducted by Locksmith and Tick-Tock where they were placed in Locksmith's prison. When in his cell, Flying Tiger felt claustrophobic. He was later freed by Spider-Woman and [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]] where Flying Tiger escaped.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref>

General Nguyen Ngoc Coy later recommended Flying Tiger to his South American rebel allies. He was later hired to abduct businessmen Regis Fussky and deposit him at a base in South America. As part of an agreement with [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Flying Tiger is not to abduct Regis Fussky until he was out of the United States. Regis Fussky hired [[Iron Man]] ([[War Machine|James Rhodes]]) into being his bodyguard while Flying Tiger replaced the co-pilot of Regis Fussky's airplane. Once the airplane is over South America, Flying Tiger emerged from the cockpit and grabbed Regis Fussky while grabbing the suitcase that contained the Iron Man armor. James Rhodes escaped in a parachute as Flying Tiger delivered Regis Fussky to his employers. Flying Tiger then flirted with a woman who couldn't open the suitcase and threw it into the jungle. James Rhodes was able to recover the suitcase and transformed into Iron Man. During Flying Tiger's fight with Iron Man, the US government began dropping bombs on Colonel Perez's camp. Flying Tiger was caught in one of the explosions. Iron Man rescued Regis Fussky and took down the fleeing Flying Tiger.<ref>''Iron Man'' #177</ref>
