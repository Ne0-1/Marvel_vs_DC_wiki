'''Mentor''' ('''A'lars''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' vol. 1 #55, and was created by [[Jim Starlin]].

Mentor is the leader of the [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titanian]] colony. His back-story was based on Greek mythology.  Some years later, he was [[retcon]]ned to be a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a race in the [[Marvel Universe]] created by [[Jack Kirby]], separately based on Greek mythology.

==Fictional character biography==
A'lars was the second son of [[Kronos (comics)|Chronos]] and Daina, two of the first generation of [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], and was born eons ago in the city of Titanos in northern Asia.  A'lars and his brother [[Zuras]] were raised in the aftermath of the great civil war which divided the first colony of Eternals.  Their father Chronos, who was on the winning side of the civil war, toiled away in his laboratory attempting to discover the secrets of the self-regenerating cosmic life force that he felt his race was capable of attaining.  A force field cylinder containing cosmic energy exploded, disintegrating Chronos' body and imparted immortality to all nearby Eternals. A'lars then became a scientist like his father.

A'lars and Zuras, both adults at the time of Chronos' death, held a general assembly to determine who would succeed him.  The assembly chose Zuras, so A'lars chose to leave the colony to avoid the sort of fraternal rivalry that led Chronos and his brother [[Uranos (comics)|Uranos]] to the first civil war.  He settled on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], taking over as leader of the underground colony that his uncle Uranos had built centuries earlier.

Upon arriving on Titan, A'lars discovered the [[Uranian (comics)|Uranian]] Eternal [[Sui-San]], the sole survivor of the civil war that destroyed the Eternals of Titan previously.  Sui-San bore two children for Mentor, [[Thanos]] and Eros (later known as [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]]). Sui-San died in Thanos' first major attack against Titan.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Mentor implored his father Chronos to aid Titan against Thanos, causing Chronos to create [[Drax the Destroyer]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #55</ref>

Mentor later met [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]]. With his son Eros, he informed Jones and Mar-Vell of Thanos's degradation of Titan. Mentor enlisted Mar-Vell's aid against Thanos.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #27</ref> Mentor was imprisoned by Thanos, but freed by Captain Marvel. Mentor joined in the battle against Thanos.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #31</ref> Later, Mentor joined in the attempt to cure Captain Mar-Vell of cancer, and attended Mar-Vell's last hours.<ref>''Death of Captain Marvel Graphic Novel''</ref>

[[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]] and [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] attempt to consult Mentor, who apparently kills them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

==In other media==
===Television===
* Mentor appears in the episode "Learning Curve" of the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]].
