'''Mentor''' ('''A'lars''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' vol. 1 #55, and was created by [[Jim Starlin]].

Mentor is the leader of the [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titanian]] colony. His back-story was based on Greek mythology.  Some years later, he was [[retcon]]ned to be a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a race in the [[Marvel Universe]] created by [[Jack Kirby]], separately based on Greek mythology.

==Fictional character biography==
A'lars was the second son of [[Kronos (comics)|Chronos]] and Daina, two of the first generation of [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].  A'lars and his brother [[Zuras]] were raised in the aftermath of the great civil war which divided the first colony of Eternals.  Their father Chronos, who was on the wining side of the civil war, toiled away in his laboratory attempting to discover the secrets of the self-regenerating cosmic life force that he felt his race was capable of attaining.  A force field cylinder containing cosmic energy exploded, disintegrating Chronos' body and imparted immortality to all nearby Eternals.

A'lars and Zuras, both adults at the time of Chronos' death, held a general assembly to determine who would succeed him.  The assembly chose Zuras, so A'lars chose to leave the colony to avoid the sort of fraternal rivalry that led to the Chronos and his brother [[Uranos (comics)|Uranos]] to the first civil war.  He settled on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], taking over as leader of the underground colony that his uncle Uranos had built centuries earlier.

Upon arriving on Titan, A'lars discovered the [[Uranian (comics)|Uranian]] Eternal [[Sui-San]], the sole survivor of the civil war that destroyed the Eternals of Titan previously.  Sui-San bore two children for Mentor, [[Thanos]] and Eros (later known as [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]]). Sui-San died in Thanos' first major attack against Titan.

===Other Media===
Mentor appears in the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]]. In this continuity he is said to be Thanos' brother.
