==Fictional character biography==

Irene always wanted to be a serious reporter working for the [[Daily Bugle]], but she got stuck working for the [[tabloid]] ''The Inquiring Eye''. When asked by her editor to investigate [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], Irene gets drawn into a conspiracy to kill [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Irene returns to her office, but finds her co-workers killed by Hellfire Club agents, who attempt to kill her. Cable appears and saves her. He tells Irene that he is from the future and hires Irene to be his chronicler. Cable wants Irene to write down his life so that other people may know about him and his missions, should he get killed. Irene accepts, but soons finds out that working with Cable is not easy; Cable leaves her behind in [[Switzerland]], when he feels that his mission endangers her and she has to return to [[New York City]] on her own. Over the next few months, Irene and Cable become close friends, though she often disagrees with him and calls him on bad decisions. Working for Cable, she also is a witness to many incredible events and lands a job as a reporter for the Daily Bugle by writing about them. During this time, Irene investigates the history of the Hellfire Club and Sebastian Shaw offers her a place in the Hellfire Club in return for her silence. Irene refuses.<ref>''Cable'' #48-95</ref><ref>''[[X-Men]]:The Hellfire Club'' #1-4</ref>

When Cable renames himself ''Soldier X'' and disappears, Irene starts to worry about him. Her work suffers as a result, but one year later she receives a message from him. He sends her his diaries and confides in her.<ref>''Soldier X'' #1-7</ref>

When he returns as Cable, she interviews the would-be [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Messiah]]. She thinks Cable's power is getting to his head and calls him on it, even bringing a gun to her office to protect herself from him, should he go insane. When Cable secretly uses a virus to turn everybody on Earth pink, only to publicly restore them later to normal, he is lauded as a hero. Irene is fired though for bringing a gun to work. Without a job, Irene moves to Providence, an island-state created by Cable to be an utopia. She takes over administrative duties in the city and basically runs the whole city when Cable is on his missions. Irene even learns to put up with [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], Cable's new associate, who often expresses a romantic interest in her. She doesn't return his feelings, seeing Deadpool as an idiot.<ref>''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #1</ref>

After the destruction of Providence by the Hecatomb, she is attacked by Sabertooth within the ruins of the island but is rescued by the timely intervention of Deadpool, leaving the island before it detonates.  She later reappears in the final issue of Cable and Deadpool during a symbiote-dinosaur attack on New York.<ref>''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #50</ref>
