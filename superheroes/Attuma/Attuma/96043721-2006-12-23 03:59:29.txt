'''Attuma''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] nomadic warlord who is the nemesis of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], and is the father of the superhero [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]]. He believes he is the prophesised conqueror of the Atlantean Empire. Attuma first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' volume 1 #33 (1964). 

==History==
Attuma was born as a member of a tribe of barbaric [[Atlantis (comics)|Atlanteans]], who were banished from [[Atlantis (comics)|Atlantis]] ages ago. For unknown reasons Attuma was born with strength, endurance and speed far superior to those of any normal Atlantean. Attuma quickly became leader of his tribe and declared that he would conquer the city of Atlantis as an ancient prophecy predicted. Attuma had a daughter, [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]], but was disappointed that his only child was female. He wanted a male child to be his heir and ignored Andromeda, who would join the army of Atlantis.

Attuma gathered his troops and attacked Atlantis, only to be defeated by [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], the Prince of Atlantis and his allies the [[Fantastic Four]]. Attuma and his troops were banished from Atlantis once again. Over the years, Attuma has been at war with both Atlantis and the "surface world" (the Atlantean name for the human nations). 

When the ruling Council of Atlantis asked Prince Namor to abdicate the throne, Namor obliged and left Atlantis. Several Atlantean nobles battled for the throne, but Attuma took the throne and became the new ruler of Atlantis. His rule was not a popular one though and Attuma kidnapped [[Marrina Smallwood]], Namor's new wife to embarrass Namor in the eyes of the Atlantean people. Namor, with the help of various superheroes including [[Alpha Flight]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], freed Marrina and battled Attuma. Attuma ended the battle when he realised that Namor was happy with Marrina and did not want to return to Atlantis. He did swear vengeance against the superheroes who had allied against him and joined the ''Lethal Legion'', a group of super-villains, shortly afterwards. The Legion was short-lived though and Attuma returned to Atlantis.

Attuma allied himself with [[Ghaur]] and his [[Deviants (comics)|Deviants]] and [[Llyra]] and her [[Lemuria|Lemurians]] against humanity. During this time, Attuma met his daughter Andromeda again, who had become a superhero and now lead a group of Atlanteans against him. Attuma fought his daughter and defeated her, but Ghaur spirited her away, having other plans for her as one of the ''Brides of [[Set (Serpent God)|Set]]''. Attuma was angred, but continued with their plans. Ghaur and Llyra tricked him though and while Attuma attacked the surface world, Ghaur and Llyra attacked Atlantis and killed a large part of the population as a sacrifice to their god Set. When hearing about Atlantis' destruction, Attuma went into a stupor and the Atlanteans retreated. Attuma was put on trial, but made his way back to Atlantis.

Shortly afterwards, Attuma briefly lost control of Atlantis and Namor returned to the throne, but Attuma regained the throne of Atlantis, when Namor was cursed as one of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], a curse which would transport Namor away whenever the Defenders were needed and leave Atlantis undefended. Attuma formed the group ''[[Deep Six (Mavel Comics)|Deep Six]]'', to defend Atlantis from Namor and the Defenders. Though outnumbered, the Defenders outsmarted Attuma and Namor retook Atlantis.

Attuma returned to his barbarian hordes and would make other attempts to conquer Atlantis and the surface world, but without any success.

{{spoiler}}
During ''[[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|The Sentry]]'' #2, Attuma attacked NYC with an undersea horde once again.  He was confronted by the Sentry, but before Attuma could finish boasting of his plans, he was apparently beheaded by the [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]].

==Powers and abilities==
Attuma is stronger and tougher than typical Atlanteans (who already possess super-human abilities); he is able to lift 40 tons on land and is even stronger underwater. He can swim up to speeds of 60 miles per hour. Like most Atlanteans, Attuma can't survive out of water without the aid of mechanical devices or certain chemicals which allow Atlanteans to breathe air. 

Attuma is a skilled warrior, trained in the use of many different weapons. He usually prefers a sword, but he has access to highly advanced weaponry.

==Notes==
* Attuma's "[[Deep Six (Mavel Comics)|Deep Six]]" was named after the first Deep Six, a group of heroes who aided Namor, including Andromeda.

==Other Media==
Attuma appeares as a villain in the video game [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]] where he was a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. He uses machines called Sonic Emmiters to take over the minds of the people of Atlantis (Execpt for Namor and Namorita, due to their half-human phisology). The Atlanteans capture Namor, and Attuma, with the aid of [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], ascends to the Atlantean throne. The heroes, responding to a distress call by Namorita, defeat Attuma and Tiger Shark, and save Atlantis.
