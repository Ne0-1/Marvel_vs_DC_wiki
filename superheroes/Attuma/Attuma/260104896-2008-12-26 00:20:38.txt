'''Attuma''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] nomadic warlord who is the nemesis of [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], and is the father of the superhero [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]]. He believes he is the prophesied conqueror of the Atlantean Empire. Attuma first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' volume 1 #33 (1964). 

==Fictional character biography==
Attuma was born as a member of a tribe of barbaric [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlanteans]], who were banished from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] ages ago. For unknown reasons Attuma was born with strength, endurance and speed far superior to those of any normal Atlantean. Attuma quickly became leader of his tribe and declared that he would conquer the city of Atlantis as an ancient prophecy predicted. Attuma had a daughter, [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]] by his wife Gelva, but was disappointed that his only child was female. He wanted a male child to be his heir and ignored Andromeda, who would join the army of Atlantis.

Attuma gathered his troops and attacked Atlantis, only to be defeated by [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], the Prince of Atlantis and his allies the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #33</ref> Attuma and his troops were banished from Atlantis once again. Over the years, Attuma has been at war with both Atlantis and the "surface world" (the Atlantean name for the human nations).  He developed a super-weapon with which to invade the surface world, but was foiled by [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #66</ref> Attuma was among the villains assembled by [[Doctor Doom]] in one of his attempts to destroy the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> He created tidal waves in another attempted invasion of the surface world, and was this time defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #26-27</ref> Attuma enslaved the nomadic Atlanteans after the destruction of Atlantis.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #4</ref> After Atlantis was rebuilt, Attuma attempted another invasion during the wedding of Namor and [[Lady Dorma|Dorma]].<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #36-37</ref> Attuma allied with the [[Red Ghost]], and used mind-controlled sea creatures in another attempted conquest of the surface world, and was this time defeated by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #7-8</ref> With [[Lemuel Dorcas|Dr. Dorcas]] and [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]], Attuma invaded [[Hydro-Base]], but was then defeated by a teaming of Namor and Doctor Doom.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #1-3</ref> Attuma then enslaved the Avengers to use them against Namor, but unintentionally instigated a battled between the Avengers and Doctor Doom.  Attuma was defeated by Namor, Doom, and the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #154-156; ''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #9</ref>

When the ruling Council of Atlantis asked Prince Namor to abdicate the throne, Namor obliged and left Atlantis. Attuma hired with his men as mercenaries to end the Atlantean civil war.  Several Atlantean nobles battled for the throne, but Attuma took the throne and became the new ruler of Atlantis. His rule was not a popular one though and Attuma kidnapped [[Marrina Smallwood]], Namor's new wife to embarrass Namor in the eyes of the Atlantean people.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #33-36</ref> Namor, with the help of various superheroes including [[Alpha Flight]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], freed Marrina and battled Attuma. Attuma ended the battle when he realized that Namor was happy with Marrina and did not want to return to Atlantis.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #39; ''Avengers'' #272</ref> He did swear vengeance against the superheroes who had allied against him and joined the ''Lethal Legion'', a group of super-villains, shortly afterwards. The Legion was short-lived though and Attuma returned to Atlantis.  During the events of the [[Evolutionary War]], Attuma joined forces with the Lemurians and reserve Avengers against the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #17</ref>

As depicted in the [[crossover]] ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'', Attuma allied himself with [[Ghaur]] and his [[Deviants (comics)|Deviants]] and [[Llyra]] and her [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemurians]] against humanity. He battled Iron Man and Namor, and then learned that the superhero Andromeda was his estranged daughter.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #10</ref> Attuma mobilized his troops for an assault against the United States.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #18</ref> He abducted [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]] as part of Ghaur's plan.  Attuma then finally met his daughter Andromeda again, who now led a group of Atlantean rebels against him. Attuma fought his daughter and defeated her in personal combat, but Ghaur spirited her away.<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #4</ref> Attuma was angered, but continued with their plans. Ghaur and Llyra tricked him though and while Attuma attacked the surface world, battling [[Spider-Man]] and the Fantastic Four, Ghaur and Llyra attacked Atlantis and killed a large part of the population as a sacrifice to their god [[Set (serpent god)|Set]]. When hearing about Atlantis' destruction, Attuma went into a stupor and the Atlanteans retreated.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #5</ref> Attuma was put on trial, but made his way back to Atlantis.

Shortly afterwards, Attuma briefly lost control of Atlantis and Namor returned to the throne, but Attuma regained the throne of Atlantis, when Namor was cursed as one of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], a curse which would transport Namor away whenever the Defenders were needed and leave Atlantis undefended. Attuma formed the group ''[[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]]'', to defend Atlantis from Namor and the Defenders. (Attuma's "Deep Six" was named after the first Deep Six, a group of heroes who aided Namor, including Andromeda.) Though outnumbered, the Defenders outsmarted Attuma and Namor retook Atlantis.

Attuma returned to his barbarian hordes and would make other attempts to conquer Atlantis and the surface world, but without any success. One such attempt would come after Attuma allied his Barbarian hordes with the forces of the Futuristic conqueror Kang. His armies would pick Canada as their point of Invasion; however they would be turned back by the super-hero group, the Avengers.

===Death===
Attuma attacked New York City with an undersea horde once again. He was confronted by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], but before Attuma could finish boasting of his plans, he was apparently beheaded by the Sentry<ref>''The Sentry'' #1</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Attuma possesses various superhuman abilities common to the Atlanteans. However, his strength, stamina, resistance to physical injury, and swimming speed are much higher than the majority of his race. Like most Atlanteans, Attuma can't survive out of water for more than 10 minutes without the aid of mechanical devices or certain chemicals which allow Atlanteans to breathe air. His stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water.

Attuma enjoys the benefits of his Atlantean nature, including complete freedom of movement in the water, increased resistance to injury, and gills that grant the ability to breathe under water. Attuma has superhuman strength and endurance. He can swim at high speeds and his body is resistant against the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans.  His specially developed vision allows him to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.

Attuma is a skilled Atlantean warrior, trained in the use of many different weapons. He is an expert hand-to-hand combatant, especially underwater, and has achieved mastery in the use of most Atlantean weapons.  He usually prefers his three-pronged iron sword, but he has access to highly advanced weaponry.
