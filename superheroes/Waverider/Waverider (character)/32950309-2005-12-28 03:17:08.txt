'''Waverider''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe. Created by [[Dan Jurgens]], he first appeared in ''Armageddon 2001'' #1 (1991).  Waverider is currently a member of the [[Linear Men (comics)|Linear Men]]

The being known as Waverider was originally a human scientist, Matthew Ryder.  In the year 2030, the world had been ruled for 20 years by an armored despot known only as [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]], who had destroyed all of Earth's super-heroes.  Most of the people of Earth had had their wills crushed by Monarch's reign.  Ryder, however, had been rescued as a child from a collapsing building by an unknown superhero and was inspired by his memory of this event to fight back.  Knowing that Monarch had once been a hero before some unknown event turned him to evil, Ryder volunteered as a time travel test subject in hopes of travelling to the past and preventing Monarch from ever coming to exist.  Though previous test subjects had died, Ryder was able to enter the [[timestream]] and was transformed into a being able to travel freely through time.  

As Waverider, Ryder is also capable of seeing a person's most probable future by temporally merging with them.  The future he sees is by no means assured, and reading a person a second time can result in a wildly different vision.  Typically, Waverider is able to temporally merge with subjects without their becoming aware of it.  Waverider used this power to try and learn which hero would become Monarch but was unsuccessful as his mere presence changed the future.  When Waverider attempted to read [[Captain Atom|Captain Atom's]] future, the interaction of their powers resulted in a massive amount of [[quantum]] energy being unleashed.  This created an opening in the quantum field which allowed Monarch (who had been monitoring Waverider's actions the whole time) to travel back in time to ensure his own existence.

After Monarch's defeat, Waverider continued to use his powers to travel the timestream attempting to render aid whenever possible. Waverider's attempts to 'fix' the timestream led him to clash with the Linear Men on multiple occasions. Eventually, Waverider joined the Linear Men and now aids them in maintaining the timestream. 

==Powers and abilities==
As Waverider, Ryder is a immensely powerful being of pure quantum energy. In addition to time travel and precognition, his known powers include the ability to alter his body to replicate another person or turn invisible, to fire energy blasts, to pass through objects and to fly at twice the speed of light. 

==Other media==
Waverider has appeared recently in animated form on the cartoon series [[Justice League Unlimited]] as a member of the super-sized, post-Thanagarian-invasion Justice League of the DC Animated Universe.

The character has made only very brief cameos throughout the first 26 episodes of the series, most notably at the beginning of "Initiation" (2004) and the end of "Hunter's Moon" (2005) and "Divided We Fall" (2005).

Although no explanation has been given for the DCAU Waverider's origin or powers, they are presumed to be the same as his comic book counterpart.  As the pre-Crisis [[Hawk]] and [[Dove]] (Hank and Don Hall) are also members of the JLU, there was speculation that the ''Armageddon 2001'' storyline would be adapted; however, the producers have since revealed that the character was included simply because he was visually striking, and to play with fans' expectations.

Even more surprising than Waverider's inclusion in the JLU was that the character, despite limited screen time, made his action figure debut in Mattel's "Justice League Unlimited" toy line in the summer of 2005.
