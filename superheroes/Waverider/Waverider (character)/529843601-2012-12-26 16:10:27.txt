==Fictional character biography==
===Armageddon 2001===
In the year 2030, the world had been ruled by a villain named [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]], who destroyed all of the Earth's superheroes. Matthew Ryder, a [[scientist]], who remembered the time he was a child and was saved by a superhero from a collapsing building, decided to fight back at Monarch's dictatorship. Matthew discovered that Monarch may have been a former hero, so Matthew built a [[time machine]] to travel back to the past to find out which hero would become Monarch. Unlike previous test subjects who had died when they tried the time machine, Matthew survived. However, he was merged with the time stream and was given numerous powers, two of them being to travel through time at his own free will and to predict a person's future. With his new powers and appearance, Matthew took up the superhero name, Waverider.<ref>''Armageddon 2001'' #1 (May 1991)</ref>

Making his way into the year 1991, Waverider predicted the futures of numerous heroes, however none of them turned out to be Monarch. When Waverider accidentally came into contact with [[Captain Atom]], the interaction of their powers resulted in a massive amount of temporal energy being unleashed. This created an opening in the quantum field which allowed Monarch, who had been monitoring Waverider's actions the whole time, to travel back in time to ensure his own existence. When Monarch later killed [[Dove (Dawn Granger)|Dove]], her partner [[Hank Hall|Hawk]] became enraged and beat Monarch and unmasked him, only to see that Monarch was Hawk himself.<ref>''Armageddon 2001'' #2 (October 1991)</ref>

===Post-Armageddon===
Soon, Waverider and various heroes he gathered defeated a demonic being called Abraxis.<ref>''Armageddon: Inferno'' (April 1992)</ref> Later, while Waverider was traveling through the time stream, he encountered himself as Matthew Ryder, who was from the year 2030, although Matthew was still a regular human and he had not become Waverider since Monarch's future reign had been erased. Following this, the two of them joined the [[Linear Men]], a group that contained time traveling beings who protected the time stream. Despite the Linear Men's policy of non-intervention in the timeline - to the point that the previously actively interfering Waverider was discouraged from preventing [[Superman]]'s death during his first battle with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] - Waverider came to Superman's aid when he discovered that Doomsday had returned to life and was now working with the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]]. Recognizing the danger of Doomsday's existence, Waverider showed Superman a detailed vision of the past to explain the circumstances of Doomsday's origin as a genetically engineered being capable of evolving to overcome anything that proved capable of killing him, as well as discovering that Doomsday's hatred of Superman was due to Doomsday's traumatic origins on [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] leaving him with a deeply rooted hatred of Kryptonians. The two heroes seemingly defeated the monster by taking him to the end of time, where the imprisoned Doomsday was destroyed by [[entropy]] as the universe itself collapsed.<ref>''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'' (January 1994)</ref>
 
Later, during [[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]], Waverider was subsequently killed by Extant, who had evolved from Monarch.<ref>''Zero Hour'' #2 (September 1994)</ref> However, the human Matthew Ryder was still alive and was soon contacted by [[Metron (comics)|Metron]], who told Matthew that he had to become Waverider and that he was the only one who could use time travel to save the universe. Matthew was then transformed into a new version of Waverider and took over the role his previous self did, helping a select group of heroes defeat Extant and [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]'s effort to recreate time according to their own design by triggering their own Big Bang with the aid of [[Damage (comics)|Damage]].

===Death===
{{See also|52 (comic book)}}
Junior and Georgia, two descendants of the villain [[Doctor Sivana]], had rebuilt their father's sphere of ''Suspendium'', which was able to let them travel in time. Although they were able to open a gateway in the past, they ultimately had to suspend their experiment. Right before shutting down the machine, they saw Waverider in the timestream, but failed to recognize him.<ref>''52'' #26 (November 2006)</ref> Later, Waverider was seen talking with the dying [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]], one of the former time traveling villains he tried to recruit in his efforts to save the timeline. [[Skeets]], infected and controlled by [[Mister Mind]], then arrived and killed the Time Commander. He then asked Waverider where and "when" [[Rip Hunter]] was in the time stream. When Waverider refused to tell, Skeets brutally tortured Waverider and later implied that he killed him and was wearing his skin.<ref>''52'' #27 (December 2006)</ref>

===Linear Woman===
[[Black Beetle (comics)|Black Beetle]], [[Despero]], [[Ultra-Humanite]], and [[Degaton]] had intended on finding Rip and killing him, so then the time stream would no longer be guarded. Black Beetle took his allies to a destroyed [[Vanishing Point]] and revealed that Rip and the Linear Men were never in agreement about how to handle time and that Rip, tired of the Linear Men's interference, locked them away in a cell at Vanishing Point. The four villains then found the cell and tore it open, seeing an alive Matthew Ryder and Liri Lee in it.<ref>''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' #3 (November 2010)</ref> Black Beetle asks the Linear Men to help bring Waverider back to life. But [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]] prevents Black Beetle from dystopia and he sends the Time Stealers back to the present, although Black Beetle escapes and Linear Men go with him.<ref>''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' #4 (October 2010)</ref> They then teleport through time to search for Waverider's corpse in the Earth's future desolate wasteland. After Black Beetle finds Waverider's corpse, he double-crosses them, revealing his plan to use Waverider's power to become invulnerable.<ref>''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' #5 (December 2010)</ref> Black Beetle attempts to fuse with Waverider's corpse's power but is thwarted by Supernova. Instead, Liri fuses with Waverider's corpse to become Linear Woman, after which Black Beetle escapes. Rip and the rest of the Time Masters arrive however Linear Woman refuses to agree with Rip's rules of time travel and teleports herself and Matthew through the timestream.<ref>''Time Masters: Vanishing Point'' #6 (February 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Waverider can time travel at any time he wants and is always capable of accessing the time stream and monitoring it. He can also access a person's aura and predict their future at any time in their life just by touching them. When he first received his powers, his entire appearance had been transformed from a normal looking man into a being with [[fire]]-like hair and yellow skin with a black outline along the back of his body. Waverider can also fly at [[lightspeed]], can fire [[quantum]] [[energy blasts]], and also has [[List of comic book superpowers#Intangibility or phasing|intangibility]] and can turn [[invisible]].

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Waverider-animated.jpg|150px|thumb|Waverider as seen in ''Justice League Unlimited'' in the episode "Initiation."]]
*Waverider appeared in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' as a member of the super-sized Justice League. He had no speaking appearances and only made very brief cameos in a few episodes, most notably in "Initiation", "Hunter's Moon", and "Divided We Fall." [[Hawk and Dove]] (Hank and Don Hall) were also members of the Justice League, which led to speculation that the ''Armageddon 2001'' storyline would be adapted; however, the producers of the show had revealed that Waverider was included simply because he was visually striking, and to play with fans' expectations.

===Toys===
*Despite limited screen time, Waverider made his action figure debut in [[Mattel]]'s [[DC Superheroes: Justice League Unlimited (toy)|''Justice League Unlimited'' toy line]] in the spring of 2006.
