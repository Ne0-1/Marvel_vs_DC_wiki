'''Bloodstone''' ('''Cullen Bloodstone''') is a fictional character from [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Bloodstone first appeared in issue #1 of the ''[[Avengers Arena]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, and was created by [[Dennis Hopeless]] and [[Kev Walker]].

==Fictional character biography==
Cullen Bloodstone is the son of [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] and the younger brother of [[Elsa Bloodstone]]. When Cullen was 10, Ulysses Bloodstone took him into an alternate dimension. Ulysses left Cullen alone in the dimension to prove his worth as a Bloodstone. He planned to retrieve Cullen the next day but due to his untimely death Cullen was stuck in the dimension for over 2 years (27 months). Cullen somehow returned to his world and was found by his sister (who thought he was at boarding school). However he was possessed by an unknown creature and had to be apprehended by Elsa. In order to keep his 'darkness' under wraps Elsa gave him a Bloodstone ring which also increases his strength. Elsa then takes Cullen to Braddock Academy to attend high school.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #14</ref>

Bloodstone is one of sixteen teenagers kidnapped by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] who forces them to fight each other to the death in his latest version of Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #1</ref> He is part of the Braddock Academy group (consisting of [[Apex (comics)|Apex]], [[Kid Briton]], [[Anachronism (comics)|Anachronism]] and [[Nara (comics)|Nara]]) which is joined by [[Deathlocket|Death Locket]] despite death threats from Kid Briton and Nara. Death Locket started bonding with Apex as she introduces her to the rest of the Braddock Academy.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #2</ref> There is discord in the Braddock Academy's ranks as Anachronism and Kid Briton get into an argument. An earthquake then separates Bloodstone and Anachronism from Apex, Nara, Kid Briton, and Death Locket.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #5</ref> Nara, Anachronism, and Bloodstone manage to survive falling into the chasm and come to the conclusion that Apex is manipulating Death Locket and Kid Briton to her own ends. The trio is then teleported by Arcade to the supply cache at Quadrant 2 just as Apex, Death Locket, and Kid Briton arrive. Nara and Apex start arguing and Apex confirms that she was the one who ordered Death Locket to attack Nara. Kid Briton tries to intervene as Nara continues calling him a "weak puppet." An irate Kid Briton attempts to kill Nara for insulting him only to be beheaded by Anachronism.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #6</ref>

After being injured by Apex, [[Nico Minoru|Nico]] sacrifices herself by staying behind in order to get the other survivors to safety.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #10</ref> The remaining teenage heroes catch up to [[Reptil]] and [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] and are invited to have shark steaks with them. Cullen Bloodstone confronts Reptil about their camping out on the beach while a war's going off elsewhere. [[Cammi (comics)|Cammi]] interjects to agree with Cullen Bloodstone before saying she's heading out to either find Nico or avenge her. Reptil heads back to shake Hazmat out of her funk. Everyone agrees to go back out into Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #11</ref>

Bloodstone, Cammi, Anachronism and Nara soon get separated from Reptil, Hazmat and X-23. He soon lashes out at Aiden and Cammi. When Aiden and Nara leave Bloodstone revealed his past to Cammi. Aiden and Nara are then seen being attacked by a feral X-23, during the time when Nara reveals to Aiden that she believes Cullen is both gay and in love with him (jealousy explaining his antagonistic behavior to Nara). Cullen decides to take off his ring and fight X-23 in his unstable form. Leaving Aiden, Nara and Cammi in the middle.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #14</ref> Cullen successfully defeats X-23, but is now wild and out of control. He is impervious to [[Nico Minoru]]'s upgraded magic, as well as [[Chase Stein]]'s [[Darkhawk (comics)|Darkhawk]] form. Nara went into the sea to retrieve the ring, and then touched it to Cullen's skin, leaving him depowered and naked, but Nara received serious injuries and died soon after in Anachronism's arms.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #15</ref> When Cullen, still naked, approaches Anachronism to offer sympathy, Anachronism then slices and beats on Cullen in a fit of rage, seriously wounding Cullen, and Cammi has to break up the fight.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #16</ref>

Despite his wounds, Cullen has been confirmed to be one of six survivors of [[Avengers Arena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48419 |title=NYCC EXCLUSIVE: HOPELESS IS SEDUCED BY EVIL IN "AVENGERS UNDERCOVER" |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to the Bloodstone ring, Cullen possesses superhuman abilities similar to those of his father Ulysses Bloodstone and his sister Elsa Bloodstone. He is superhumanly strong and durable, has greater than normal stamina, agility, and reflexes. Cullen is also able to rapidly regenerate from any damage he has sustained. The Bloodstone ring also prevents him from transforming into the form of a creature from another dimension called a Glaratrox (a creature that can engulf the soul of its host, and feed on the host's anger and fear to become more powerful).

Cullen has shown a high degree of marksmanship with firearms.
