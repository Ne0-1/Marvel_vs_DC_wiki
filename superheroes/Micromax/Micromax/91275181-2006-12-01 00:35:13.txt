'''Micromax (Scott Wright)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]] of the [[Marvel universe]].

He first appeared in ''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #44, where he mistook [[Rachel Summers]] for a burglar. After a few missions with Excalibur, he resigned from the FI6 police of the [[United Kingdom]] force to join the [[Brand Corporation]] in [[New Jersey]]. He kept using his super-hero identity from time to time, and even helped the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] face the invasion of [[Kang the Conqueror]].

Though very few people are aware of this, Micromax is actually an out of shape middle-aged man whose powers make him able to look like a younger, athletic person.

In ''[[Civil War (comics)|X-Men: Civil War]]'' #1, it is been revealed that Micromax has formed a policing force against unruly mutants. This team is fronted by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] with additional team mate [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]]. Micromax is therefore associated with Iron Man's side.

During a battle with [[X-Force]] & the surviving original [[X-Men]], he was stabbed in the chest by [[Shatterstar]]. He is currently in critical condition.

==Powers and Abilities==
Micromax can increase, decrease or redistribute his body's size and mass. As a former special agent he no doubt has police training.
