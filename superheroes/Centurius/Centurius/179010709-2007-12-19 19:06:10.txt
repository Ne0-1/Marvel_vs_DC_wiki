'''Centurius''' is a fictional super villain appearing in publications by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Doctor Noah Black was an African American geneticist who won a [[Nobel Prize]] in the 1930s.  He was shown to be present at a conference on genetics in the 1930's along with [[High Evolutionary|Herbert Wyndham]], [[Arnim Zola]], and [[Enclave (comics)|Wladyslav Shinsky]].<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #3</ref>

Sometime after winning the Prize, he went mad and retreated to a remote island (Valhalla Island) to conduct genetic experiments, seeing himself as a self-proclaimed savior of Earth. He was successful in evolving numerous monstrous creatures.  He was transporting his newly created life forms aboard an orbiting space ark and planning to destroy all remaining life on Earth. By chance, secret agents [[Nick Fury]] and [[Jimmy Woo]] discovered the island when they were forced to crash land their aircraft there.  The pair initially attempted to convince Centurius to return to civilization with them, but when the geneticist's plot for genocide was revealed, Fury and his companion attacked. In a ploy to defeat the agents, Centurius attempted to transform himself into a "superior being" using a device called the Evolutionizer, but instead of evolving he was turned into a handful of protoplasmic slime.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #2 (July 1968)</ref>

Much later, Centurius was revealed to have been transformed by the ray into a "superior being", and then somehow regained human form.  As a member of the group known as the [[Conspiracy (comics)|Conspiracy]], he became involved in a plot to gain untold power by gathering and reuniting the lost fragments of the Bloodgem, a mystic jewel from another dimension. He clashed with [[Ulysses Bloodstone]].<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #3</ref> However, The Conspiracy's efforts ultimately failed in their base in a cavern beneath Central Park in New York City, resulting in the deaths of the entire group when they were absorbed into the Bloodgem creature. Ulysses Bloodstone then smashed the Bloodgem creature, shattering it.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' Vol. 1, #8 (Apr. 1978)</ref> 

Much later still, Centurius was found to somehow not be dead after all but a prisoner at the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]], a prison for super powered criminals, from which he able to escape with numerous other inmates. He currently remains at large.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref>

Someone that looks like Centurius was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate <ref>New Avengers #35 (2007)</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Centurius was a normal human being, though an extraordinary genius with extraordinarily advanced knowledge of genetic engineering and other areas of science and technology and has earned a Ph D. in physics. He was exposed to an "evolution ray" from his Evolutionizer device, which temporarily transformed him into a physically "superior being".  He also apparently ages at an extremely slow rate for unknown reasons.

He wears body armor of his own design but unknown composition, and uses "stun-discs" and ray guns firing unknown energies. He has also designed and built advanced aircraft and spacecraft, and a thermalic suppression beam.
