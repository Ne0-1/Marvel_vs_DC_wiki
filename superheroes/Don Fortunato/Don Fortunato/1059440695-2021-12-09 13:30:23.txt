'''Vincente Fortunato''' is fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an elderly crime boss and enemy of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. He first appeared in ''Spider-Man'' #70. He is affiliated with the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], and a competitor to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''Spider-Man'' #70 (July 1996) and was created by [[Howard Mackie]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

==Fictional character biography==
When the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk) was absent from New York for a long period of time, Fortunato stepped into the power vacuum and, using his Hydra ties, was able to force the other crime lords, such as the [[Slug (comics)|Slug]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], into accepting him as the new kingpin.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #73</ref>

His elder son [[Jimmy-6|Giachomo "Jimmy-6" Fortunato]] is present at the meeting where Fortunato portrays his power. The Don brings out the killer [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to be executed. Then he brings out random civilians from each of the crime lord's territories. The plan is to have each crime lord kill a civilian, showcasing how Fortunato would punish disobedience by civilian massacres.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #74</ref>

Jimmy-6, horrified, pulls a gun on his father in front of the crowd of people. The spectators do not intervene, wishing to see how Fortunato would handle this. [[Ben Reilly]] (then Spider-Man), intervenes, soon joined by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. The innocent civilians are freed but they and the heroes are cornered, pursued by various members of the meeting. Jimmy-6 shows up in an attack helicopter, killing the pursuers and rescuing the civilians and the superheroes. Jimmy eventually reconciles with his father, but extends his debt to Ben to Peter Parker.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #255</ref>

Fortunato's dominance was eventually shattered when the Kingpin returned, launching a massed simultaneous attack on New York's crime lords and taking command during the confusion. The assassin [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] attacks Fortunato on the Kingpin's orders, leaving him comatose. Jimmy-6 was seen leading his organization for several months afterward. Later, the elderly Fortunato re-emerged and bought the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] at an auction for his younger son, the awkward 18-year-old [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)#Angelo Fortunato|Angelo]]. Angelo attempts to use the suit to kill Spider-Man, but the symbiote rejects him as unworthy and allowed him to fall to his death.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> It was also confirmed that Jimmy-6 had somehow made peace with his father, as Fortunato briefly referred to him as "My Beautiful Giacomo", showing no signs of ill will.<ref>''[[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)#"Venomous" (issues 5-8)|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man]]'' #7</ref>
