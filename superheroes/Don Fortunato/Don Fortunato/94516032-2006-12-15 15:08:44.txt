'''Vincente Fortunato''' is an elderly crime boss and enemy of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]].  He is affiliated with the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], and a competitor to the [[Kingpin (comics)]]. When the Kingpin was absent from New York for a long period of time, Fortunato stepped into the power vacuum and, using his Hydra ties, was able to force the other crime-lords into accepting him as the new kingpin, having several brutal clashes against [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. 

His elder son Giacomo (better known as [[Jimmy Six]]) attempted to destroy his organization, angry at seeing his father working with people like Hydra.  When Fortunato attempted to have Jimmy Six killed, [[Ben Reilly]] (then Spider-Man) intervened, saving Jimmy's life. Jimmy eventually reconciled with his father, but extended his debt to Ben to Peter Parker.

Fortunato's dominance was eventually shattered when the Kingpin returned, launching a massed simultaneous attack on New York's crime-lords and taking command during the confusion. He was rarely seen since. Later, Fortunato bought the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] at auction for his younger son, the awkward 18-year-old Angelo.  Angelo attempted to use the suit to kill Spider-Man, but the symbiote rejected him as unworthy. (see Marvel Knights Spider-Man Vol. 1, Issue 8).
