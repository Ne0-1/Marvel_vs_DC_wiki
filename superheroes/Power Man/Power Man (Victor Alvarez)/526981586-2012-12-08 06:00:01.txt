==Fictional character biography==
Victor Alvarez was first introduced as a [[Afro-Dominican]] teenager from the neighborhood of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in [[New York City]]. As a child, he was caught in an explosion caused by the villain [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] that resulted in the deaths of over 100 people. Victor survived by somehow using a technique that drew the [[chi]] from the dead bodies around him and temporarily granted him superhuman strength and durability.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #3</ref>

Some time later, Victor took on the name Power Man and began using his abilities to fight crime as a hero for hire, advertising his services on sites like [[Craigslist]]. Victor's activities eventually drew the attention of [[Luke Cage]], a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] who had once used the Power Man name. Cage and his partner [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] eventually learn that Victor is the son of Shades, a Dominican supervillain that Cage had fought years earlier. Though Victor dislikes both Cage and Iron Fist, he eventually teams up with them to help the other heroes fight the crazed [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] and his army of [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #1-4</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2587 Review Shadowland: Power Man #1]</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Power Man ends up teleported onto a station in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with [[Amadeus Cho]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Thunderstrike]], and [[X-23]]. They end up fighting a bunch of samurai Shark Men.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #1</ref> Power Man is part of the new class of students when the [[Avengers Academy]] moves to the former headquarters of the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21 (Nov. 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of the traumatic explosion during his childhood, Power Man possesses the ability to draw [[chi]] energy from those around him and make him stronger and more durable than an average human. When utilizing this power, Victor's skin color changes to a glowing red. The technique is similar to the one that gives Iron Fist his abilities, something the hero commented on during his first encounter with Victor.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2</ref> Victor Alvarez wears a yellow and black body suit with metal embellishments, similar to the look of Luke Cage, the first (heroic) Power Man.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/16432/earths_mightiest_costumes_luke_cage Earth's Mightiest Costumes: Luke Cage]</ref>
