'''Felix Faust''' is a [[fiction|fictional]] [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] and [[supervillain]] who appears in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in [[1962]] as an adversary of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

==Faust's origin==
The first recorded whereabouts of the mighty sorcerer now known as Felix Faust is from circa 5,000 BC, at which time he appeared in the legendary African empire of Kor. King of Kor was [[Doctor Mist|Nommo]], prime wizard of his time, and the guardian of the mystic power called the Flame of Life. The evil sorcerer battled Nommo, attempting to use the Flame's power to his own corrupt ends. Nommo then called the Flame of Life into himself, defeating the sorcerer by banishing him to another dimension.

In the mid-1920s, a madman and wannabe-magician named Dekan Drache stumbled upon the dimension and managed to open a portal to it. Released, the sorcerer destroyed Dracheâ€™s soul and entered his body. However, though alive on Earth once more, the sorcerer found his powers drastically reduced.

Obsessed with restoring his mystic might, the sorcerer read the story of how the man called [[Faust]] had sold his soul to the devil for supernatural powers, and decided to do the same. Inspired by the story's main character, the sorcerer now called himself Felix Faust and began a never-ending quest for mystical knowledge.

Over the years, Faust's hunger for magical power proved very costly to him.  He has bargained his soul for knowledge away on many occasions, only to buy it back later when his acquisitions failed to help him meet his goals; every time, he'd end up worse than before.  Eventually, he found it difficult find any mystics willing to purchase his tarnished soul.  Finally, he tried to trick Neron into giving him power by offering the pure soul of an innocent girl he murdered in lieu of his own.  Unfortunately for him, Neron saw through the ruse and punished Faust by setting the girl's vengeful spirit upon him.  For a time, Faust's damned soul languished in a hellish plane for magicians who had abused or ignored the laws of magic.  By means yet unknown, he has left this prison and is once again active on Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Felix Faust is unschooled in physical battle, and a sub-par hand-to-hand combatant. He is, however, a master sorcerer able to control vast magical power to affect reality itself. When he first appeared, Faust was unique amongst magicians, of his caliber, requiring books or scrolls of spells to focus his powers. However, in recent appearances he seems to have overcome this disadvantage.

==Offspring==
Felix Faust has two offspring, [[Fauna Faust|Fauna]] and [[Sebastian Faust]]. Of the two, Sebastian's soul was bartered to the demon Nebiros, but the power Felix asked for was granted to Sebastian instead. As a result, the father-son relationship has been adversarial. Sebastian has generally acted as a hero, working with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], Justice League and [[Sentinels of Magic]].

==In other media==
In an episode of ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', Felix Faust was in a prison with the [[Penguin]], voiced by [[Robert Morse]]. Faust was about to cast a spell to escape by transferring [[Superman|Superman's]] powers into himself, but Penguin seized the opportunity, stole the Superman powers, and broke out easily, leaving Faust behind. Faust later stripped Peguin of Superman's powers, and gained them himself, but he also proved vulnerable to [[Kryptonite]] and was recaptured with Penguin by [[Wonder Woman]]. The two were again jailed in the same cell, much to the dismay of both. [[Peter Cullen]] provided Faust's voice.

Felix Faust later appeared in the [[2000s]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', where he transformed the residents of [[Themyscira]] into stone to force Wonder Woman to gather the parts of a key to [[Hades]]. Faust had made a deal with Hades himself so that, if Faust could free Hades, then Hades will provide Faust with the "ultimate knowledge". Wonder Woman managed to get the help of her friends from the Justice League in her quest for the key.

Batman discovered that Faust had been an archaeologist with a heretic interest in occult arts. He became a sorcerer and then was expelled from the university. He swore to get revenge on the people who have scorned them, and probably used sorcery to torture them. Batman discovered from a former associate of Faust, that the parts of the key would free the mad god Hades from the hell where he was banished long ago. Thus, the League decided not to give Faust the key without a fight.

However, Faust got the key and ran away. Faust managed to free Hades and even provided him with [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] as a sacrifice. Hades betrayed Faust and aged him on the spot to a withered old man, claiming that, "Ultimately, pain and suffering are all mankind will ever know". Faust recovered enough to attack Hades while Hades was busy fighting Hippolyta and her allies. With a second attack, Hades completely annihilited Faust, reducing him to clean bones and then to dust.

In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] managed to trap Felix's soul in a mirror. He tricked Tala into chanting a spell, freeing Faust and trapping Tala in the mirror. Faust, then took control of the [[Annihilator]], an extremely powerful magical automaton forged by the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], and used it to take over Tartarus. Eventually, Wonder Woman and [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Shayera]] destroyed the Annihilator, leaving Hades to torture Felix's soul.

*Felix Faust made additional (albeit out of continuity) appearances in Justice League Adventures #32 attempting to control various league members.  He would then appear in Justice League Unlimited #26, helping [[Black Manta]] to conquer Atlantis.

[[Robert Englund]] provided the voice for The Justice League/JLU version of Faust.
