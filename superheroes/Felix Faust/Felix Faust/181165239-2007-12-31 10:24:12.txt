'''Felix Faust''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] and [[supervillain]] that appears in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in [[1962]] as an adversary of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
The first recorded whereabouts of the mighty sorcerer now known as Felix Faust is from circa [[5th millennium BC|5,000 BC]], at which time he appeared in the legendary African empire of [[Kor]]. The king of Kor was [[Doctor Mist|Nommo]], the prime wizard of his time and the guardian of the mystic power called the Flame of Life. The evil sorcerer battled Nommo, attempting to use the Flame's power to his own corrupt ends. Nommo then called the Flame of Life into himself, defeating the sorcerer by banishing him to another dimension.

In the mid-[[1920s]], a madman and wannabe-magician named Dekan Drache stumbled upon the dimension and managed to open a portal to it. Released, the sorcerer destroyed Dracheâ€™s soul and entered his body. However, though alive on Earth once more, the sorcerer found his powers drastically reduced.

Obsessed with restoring his mystic might, the sorcerer read the story of how the man called [[Faust]] had sold his soul to the devil for supernatural powers, and decided to do the same. Inspired by the story's main character, the sorcerer now called himself '''Felix Faust''' and began a never-ending quest for mystical knowledge.

Over the years, Faust's hunger for magical power proved very costly to him.  He has bargained his soul for knowledge away on many occasions, only to buy it back later when his acquisitions failed to help him meet his goals; every time, he'd end up worse than before.  Eventually, he found it difficult to find any mystics willing to purchase his tarnished soul.  Finally, he tried to trick [[Neron]] into giving him power by offering the pure soul of an innocent girl he murdered in lieu of his own.  Unfortunately for him, Neron saw through the ruse and punished Faust by setting the girl's vengeful spirit upon him.  For a time, Faust's damned soul languished in a hellish plane for magicians who had abused or ignored the laws of magic.

===Activities during 52===
{{main|52 (comic book)}}

During the event known as [[52 (comic book)|52]], a voice from within the helm of [[Doctor Fate]] speaks to [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] and promises to fulfill his desires if he makes certain sacrifices. Dibny journeys with the helm through the [[afterlife|afterlives]] of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic. The [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] promises to resurrect his late wife Sue in exchange for Dibny's taking vengeance on her murderer, [[Jean Loring]], but Dibny is unable to do so. 

At [[Nanda Parbat]], Rama Kushna tells Dibny, "The end is already written." In [[Dr. Fate]]'s tower, Dibny begins the spell to resurrect Sue, puts on the helmet of Fate, and shoots it, revealing [[Felix Faust]], who was posing as Nabu.  Faust planned to trade Dibny's soul to Neron in exchange for his own freedom.

Ralph reveals that he was aware of Faust's identity for some time, and that the binding spell surrounding the tower is designed to imprison Faust, not to counter any negative effects of the spell.  [[Neron]] appears and kills Dibny, only to realize too late that the binding spell responds only to Dibny's commands: through his death Ralph has trapped Faust and Neron in the tower.

===One Year Later===
One year after ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Faust somehow escaped from the Tower of Fate (how he he escaped will be addressed in [[Black Adam]]'s miniseries), and contacted [[Red Tornado]]'s soul which was still adrift after fighting [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] alongside [[Donna Troy]], the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and their allies. Working with [[Dr. Impossible]], [[Professor Ivo]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)| Solomon Grundy]], Faust posed as [[Deadman]] and offered the android his heart's desire: a human body.  The Tornado accepted, and Faust bound his soul into his new body. Faust and his allies then stole the Red Tornado's original android body for their own purposes.

After lending his concealment spells to [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], Faust joined with [[Talia al Ghul]] in order to corrupt yet another hero: [[Black Alice]]. Faust offered Alice power, wealth, a place in the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] and the resurrection of her mother, but Alice refused, sent Faust out of town and tapped into his powers so she could perform the resurrection herself. After this, Faust seemed to rejoin the Society.

==Powers and abilities==
Felix Faust is unschooled in physical battle, and a sub-par [[hand-to-hand]] combatant. He is, however, a master sorcerer able to control vast magical power to affect reality itself. When he first appeared, Faust was unique amongst magicians, of his caliber, requiring books or scrolls of spells to focus his powers. However, in recent appearances he seems to have overcome this disadvantage.

When Felix Faust first appeared in ''Justice League of America'' #9, he was using the [[Necronomicon]], the occult book from the stories of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], to summon three demons. In a later appearance the title of the work was changed.

==Legacy==

Felix Faust has two offsprings:
*[[Fauna Faust|Fauna]]
*[[Sebastian Faust]]

Of the two, Sebastian's soul was bartered to the demon [[Nebiros]], but the power Felix asked for was granted to Sebastian instead. As a result, the father-son relationship has been adversarial. Sebastian has generally acted as a hero, working with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], Justice League and [[Sentinels of Magic]].

==In other media==
*In an episode of ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', Felix Faust was in a prison with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], voiced by [[Robert Morse]]. Faust was about to cast a spell to escape by transferring [[Superman]]'s powers into himself, but Penguin seized the opportunity, stole the Superman powers, and broke out easily, leaving Faust behind. Faust later stripped Penguin of Superman's powers, and gained them himself, but he also proved vulnerable to [[Kryptonite]] and was recaptured with Penguin by [[Wonder Woman]]. The two were again jailed in the same cell, much to the dismay of both. [[Peter Cullen]] provided Faust's voice.
*In ''[[Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew]]'', the [[anthropomorphic]][[funny animal]]-dominated [[alternate world]] of [[Earth C-Minus]] parallels pre-Crisis [[Earth-One]]. It has an heroic [[Just A Lotta Animals]] (which parallels Earth-One's pre-Crisis [[Justice League of America]]) as well as "funny animal" supervillains like "Feline Faust," an evil cat sorceror. Feline Faust later re-appeared in the current ''Captain Carrot and the Final Arc'' storyline, where it was disclosed that he had created an evil counterpart of the [[Zoo Crew]]'s resident mage, [[Alley-Kat-Abra]], and framed the original for the murder of her team mate [[Little Cheese]].

===DC Animated Universe=== 
[[Image:Felixfaustanimated.png|thumbnail|right|Felix Faust voiced by [[Robert Englund]].]]
Felix Faust later appeared in the [[2000s]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', where he transformed the residents of [[Themyscira]] into stone to force Wonder Woman to gather the parts of a key to [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]]. Faust had made a deal with Hades himself so that, if Faust could free Hades, then Hades will provide Faust with the "ultimate knowledge". Wonder Woman managed to get the help of her friends from the Justice League in her quest for the key.

Batman discovered that Faust had been an archaeologist with a heretic interest in occult arts. He became a sorcerer and then was expelled from the university. He swore to get revenge on the people who have scorned them, and probably used sorcery to torture them. Batman discovered from a former associate of Faust, that the parts of the key would free the mad god Hades from the hell where he was banished long ago. Thus, the League decided not to give Faust the key without a fight.

However, Faust got the key and ran away. Faust managed to free Hades and even provided him with [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] as a sacrifice. Hades betrayed Faust and aged him on the spot to a withered old man, claiming that, "Ultimately, pain and suffering are all mankind will ever know". Faust recovered enough to attack Hades while Hades was busy fighting Hippolyta and her allies. With a second attack, Hades completely annihilited Faust, reducing him to clean bones and then to dust.

In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] managed to trap Felix's soul in a mirror. He tricked Tala into chanting a spell, freeing Faust and trapping Tala in the mirror. Faust, then took control of the Annihilator, an extremely powerful magical automaton forged by the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], and used it to take over Tartarus. Eventually, Wonder Woman and [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Shayera]] destroyed the Annihilator, leaving Hades to amuse himself torturing Felix's soul forever.

*Felix Faust made additional (albeit out of continuity) appearances in ''Justice League Adventures'' #32 attempting to control various league members.  He would then appear in ''Justice League Unlimited'' #26, helping [[Black Manta]] to conquer Atlantis.

[[Robert Englund]] provided the voice for The Justice League/JLU version of Faust.
