'''Felix Faust''' is a [[fiction|fictional]] [[sorcerer]] and [[supervillain]] who appears in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in [[1962]] as an adversary of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

==Faust's origin==
The first recorded whereabouts of the mighty sorcerer now known as Felix Faust is from circa 5,000 BC, at which time he appeared in the legendary African empire of Kor. King of Kor was Nommo, prime wizard of his time, and the guardian of the mystic power called the Flame of Life. The evil sorcerer battled Nommo, attempting to use the Flame's power to his own corrupt ends. Nommo then called the Flame of Life into himself, defeating the sorcerer by banishing him to another dimension.

In the mid-1920s, a madman and wannabe-magician named Dekan Drache stumbled upon the dimension and managed to open a portal to it. Released, the sorcerer destroyed Dracheâ€™s soul and entered his body. However, though alive on Earth once more, the sorcerer found his powers drastically reduced.

Obsessed with restoring his mystic might, the sorcerer read the story of how the man called [[Faust]] had sold his soul to the devil for supernatural powers, and decided to do the same. Inspired by the story's main character, the sorcerer now called himself Felix Faust and began a never-ending quest for mystical knowledge.

==In other media==
Felix Faust appeared in the [[2000s]] [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', where he transformed the residents of [[Themyscira]] into stone to force [[Wonder Woman]] to gather the parts of a key to [[Hades]]. Faust had made a deal with Hades himself so that, if Faust could free Hades, then Hades will provide Faust with the "ultimate knowledge". Wonder Woman managed to get the help of her friends from the [[Justice League]] in her quest for the key.

Batman discovered that Faust had been an archaeologist with a heretic interest in occult arts. He became a sorcerer and then was expelled from the university. He swore to get revenge on the people who have scorned them, and probably used sorcery to torture them. Batman discovered from a former associate of Faust, that the parts of the key would free the mad god Hades from the hell where he was banished long ago. Thus, the League decided not to give Faust the key without a fight.

But Faust got the key and ran away. Faust managed to free Hades and even provided him with [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] as a sacrifice, but Hades betrayed Faust and injured him. Faust recovered enough to attack Hades while Hades was busy fighting Hyppolita and her allies. With a second attack, Hades completely annihilited Faust, reducing him to clean bones and then to dust.

In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] managed to trap Felix's soul in a mirror. He tricked Tala into chanting a spell, freeing Faust and trapping Tala in the mirror. Faust, then took control of the Annihilator and used it to take over Tartarus. Eventually, Wonder Woman and [[Hawkgirl|Shayera]] destroyed the Annihilator and Felix's soul is now being tortured by Hades. 

Faust was voiced by [[Robert Englund]].

==Powers==
Felix Faust is unschooled in physical battle, and a sub-par hand-to-hand combatant. He is, however, a master sorcerer able to control vast amounts of natural power affecting organic matter. Unlike more powerful magicians, Faust generally requires books or scrolls of spells to focus his powers.
