==Publication history==
Blade appeared in most issues of Marvel Comics' ''Tomb of Dracula'' from #10-21, with additional appearances in #24 & #28 (altogether ranging from July 1973 - Sept. 1974).

Blade next came into prominence in the 1990s, beginning with ''[[Daniel Ketch|Ghost Rider]]'' #28 (Aug. 1992), in the [[Midnight Sons]] imprint that included issues of ''[[Darkhold|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins]]'', ''Ghost Rider'', ''Ghost Rider / [[Johnny Blaze|Blaze]]: Spirits of Vengeance'', ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'',  ''[[Morbius the Living Vampire|Morbius]]'', and ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''. Blade co-starred in the 18-issue ''Nightstalkers'', and appeared with that team in a story in the [[anthology]] ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #1 (April 1993). He appeared in two solo stories in ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #2 & 7 (July 1993 & Oct. 1994).

Following the cancellation of ''Nightstalkers'', Blade debuted in his first color-comics series, ''Blade: The Vampire Hunter'' #1-10 (July 1994 - April 1995), written by [[Ian Edginton]] (with the last two issues by [[Terry Kavanagh]]) and penciled by [[Doug Wheatley]]. Blade next appeared in a 12-page inventory story in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] anthology ''Marvel: Shadows and Light'' #1 (Feb. 1997). He then starred again in two solo one-shots: ''Blade: Crescent City Blues'' (March 1998), by writer [[Christopher Golden]] and penciller co-creator Gene Colan, and ''Blade: Sins of the Father'' (Oct. 1998), by writer [[Marc Andreyko]] and penciller [[Bart Sears]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and career===
[[Image:blademu2.png|thumb|''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sep7. 1973). Painted cover art by [[Gray Morrow]].]]
Blade was born in a [[whorehouse]] in the [[Soho]] neighborhood of [[London, England]].<ref name="mpreview">''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973), with story panels at [http://members.aol.com/Erommel43/bladeorigin1.htm "The Origin of Blade", by Mike Rickard].</ref> 
Blade's mother, Tara Brooks, was a prostitute at Madame Vanity's Brothel. When his mother experienced severe labor complications, a doctor was summoned who was in actuality [[Deacon Frost]], a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] who feasted on her during Blade's birth, killing her, and inadvertently passing along certain enzymes in his own blood to the infant. This resulted in Blade's quasi-vampiric abilities, including a greatly prolonged lifespan and the ability to sense supernatural creatures, as well as an immunity to complete vampirism. Brooks' fellow [[prostitutes]] drove off Frost before he could kill the infant as well.

Blade grew up living at Madame Vanity's, and at age 9, returning home from school one December, he saw an old man being attacked by three vampires. Blade helped the old man, who used a silver cane to kill the vampires, fight off the attackers. The man was Jamal Afari, a [[jazz]] [[trumpet]]er and vampire-hunter who then moved into Madame Vanity's and trained the young Blade in both music and combat. Blade was soon able to defeat many of the weak, younger vampires that he and Afari found in abundance.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973)</ref> Blade became an Olympic-level athlete and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, with an expertise in  [[edged weapon]]s such as [[knives]] and [[daggers]].

However, Blade's victories made him cocky. He joined a street gang, the Bloodshadows, headed by a much older and more powerful vampire than any Blade had met before, named Lamia. Blade barely defeated Lamia, and, in doing so, lost his girlfriend Glory.

Afari himself later fell prey to [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], the first occurrence in an ongoing battle between Dracula and Blade.<ref>The first battle between Dracula and Blade's original band of vampire hunters recounted in ''Tomb of Dracula'' #30</ref> Blade slew the vampire Afari and tracked Dracula back to [[Europe]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Asia]], staking him many times, but never completely destroying him.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #10</ref> In [[China]], Blade joined Ogun Strong's vampire hunters,{{Fact|date=September 2007}} which included Azu, Orji and Musenda. Together, they staked Dracula again. Dracula survived, and killed all the hunters except Blade and Musenda (who eventually retired from vampire hunting). Orji had created a lasting impression on Blade with his use of wooden daggers to combat vampires, leading to Blade adopting that weapon as his preferred arms. Consumed by grief for his fallen comrades, Blade resumed his quest alone.

===Quincy Harker's vampire-hunters===
[[Image:blademu3.png|thumb|left|''Nightstalkers'' #3 (Jan. 1993): The "revamped" costume: Cover art by [[Ron Garney]] & [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].]]
Blade eventually located Dracula in Paris, where he first encountered the vampire hunter [[Quincy Harker]] (son of [[Jonathan Harker]]), whom he knew by reputation, and Harker's vampire hunters: [[Rachel van Helsing]] (granddaughter of [[Abraham Van Helsing]]), [[Taj Nital]], and [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]].<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #12-14</ref> Because of his mercurial temperament, Blade had a strained but steady relationship with the group, allying himself with them on several occasions.

Later, after an unsuccessful battle with Dracula,<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #17</ref> Blade realized he was immune to turning from a vampire's bite.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #19</ref> Armed with this knowledge, he parted company with Harker<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #21</ref> and went after Deacon Frost alone. Blade later battled Dracula in London,<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #24</ref> battled [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]],<ref>''Fear'' #24</ref>, and then battled the [[Legion of the Dead]],<ref>''Vampire Tales'' #8-9</ref> who framed him for murder. <ref>''Marvel Preview'' #3</ref> Blade also destroyed a band of vampire children.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #8</ref>

Blade's hunt for his mother's killer led him to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he again encountered Harker's crew,{{Fact|date=September 2007}} now temporarily allied with Dracula against a larger threat, [[Doctor Sun]]. Following this battle, Dracula withdrew, and Blade again set out on his own.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #41-42</ref>

He eventually encountered [[Hannibal King]], a [[private detective]] whom Deacon Frost had turned into a vampire.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #45</ref> While initially distrusting King, Blade teamed up with him to hunt Frost. Blade and King fought together against Blade's evil [[doppelgÃ¤nger]], who absorbed the real Blade.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} King enlisted the help of Daimon Hellstrom, the so-called [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]], who exorcised Blade from the doppelgÃ¤nger and killed it with King's help. Blade and King eventually caught up with Frost, who had created an army of vampiric doppelgÃ¤ngers, one for each of his victims. Together, they shut down Frost for good, destroying Frost, and forging a lasting friendship.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #53</ref>

Blade, Rachel Van Helsing, and [[Harold H. Harold]] later confronted Dracula.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #54</ref> Blade also saved Musenda's wife from becoming a vampire.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #58</ref>

===The Nightstalkers===
{{main|Nightstalkers (comics)}}
In later years, Blade, along with King and Drake, became a frequent ally of the [[sorcerer]] [[Doctor Strange]], and the three assisted Strange in battled Dracula and the [[Darkhold|Darkholders]] and assisted in the casting of the [[Montesi Formula]], which for a time destroyed all vampires on Earth.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #59-62</ref> Blade, King and Drake then formed the private detective agency Borderline Investigations Inc., to combat supernatural threats. Alongside Doctor Strange, the three detectives battled the Darkholders again.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #67</ref> Blade also rescued his close friend Safron Caulder from the Darkholders.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #64</ref>

The agency discontinued after Drake left and Blade was committed to a psychiatric hospital following a battle with a temporarily resurrected [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Doctor Strange later arranged the release of Blade so that he could join Drake and King in reforming Borderline Inc. as the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]. Blade, King, and Drake were hired by the demonic [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]] to kill the second [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and the non-powered [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]].  The three Nightstakers battled [[Meatmarket (comics)|Meatmarket]].<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1</ref> The Nightstalkers then teamed with Ghost Rider, Blaze, Morbius, Doctor Strange, and the [[Darkhold Redeemers]] to battle Lilith and her [[Lilin (comics)|Lilin]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #31</ref> The Nightstalkers also battled other threats, such as [[HYDRA]]'s DOA.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #2-4</ref> 

Upon the eventual weakening of the Montesi Formula, and the return of vampires, Blade encountered and staked a former alley, a now-vampiric [[Taj Nital]], and survived a battle with the vampire lord [[Varnae]] in which Drake and King appeared to have been killed.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #18 (April 1994)</ref>

===Daywalker===
[[Image:blademu4.png|thumb|''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8 (Aug. 1999): Morbius transforms Blade into a Daywalker. Cover art by [[John Romita Jr.]] & [[Scott Hanna]].]]
A solo vampire-hunter once again, Blade briefly joined forces with the mystic [[John Carik|Bible John Carik]], and encountered a vampire impersonating [[Deacon Frost]] and a once-again resurrected Dracula. Later, in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], Blade discovered that [[Hannibal King]] had survived, and the two joined forces to defeat a genuinely resurrected Frost. Blade remained active in New Orleans, defeating the vampire Ulysses Sojourner and his own former ally, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]], who was under Sojourner's mental thrall. Blade followed Morbius to New York, where, while teamed with [[Spider-Man]], Blade was bitten by Morbius.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> Blade's blood enzymes reacted unexpectedly with Morbius's unique form of [[vampirism]] to grant Blade many vampire strengths while eliminating weaknesses inherent to a vampire, most notably the weakness to sunlight. It was at this time that Blade assumed the unofficial title of "Daywalker" among his prey.

The [[United Nations]]-sanctioned [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] sought to use Blade's blood for Project: Silvereye, an attempt at cloning vampire operatives. Blade and the vampire-hunting twins Mosha and Mikado shut down the project. Blade later joined Noah Van Helsing (actually Noah Tremayne, Rachel Van Helsing's adopted cousin) and several vampire hunters worldwide to stop Dracula from becoming a genuinely god-like vampire lord. Blade then returned to the now [[Hurricane Katrina]]-ravaged New Orleans.

Blade reencountered Dracula, and appeared to fully destroy the vampire once again, aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] ''Pericles V''. Unbeknownst to Blade, his wealthy father, Lucas Cross, had been responsible for Dracula's most recent resurrection. Cross later kidnapped Blade and attempted to force Blade to feed on a [[virgin]] girl; in an attempt to fulfill a prophecy. Blade escaped after biting through his own hand. Later, Blade would feed on a virgin after biting an evil vampire [[priest]], [[Draconis]].

Blade in exchange for undertaking a [[time-travel]] adventure for the [[supervillain]] [[Doctor Doom]], received from Doom an elixir that would purportedly cure a vampire of thirst for human blood but would also remove the bloodlust vampire hunters get for killing the undead. At the end of the series, Blade gave Hannibal King the elixir. During this time-travel mission, Blade fulfilled another part of the prophecy by freeing his imprisoned father.

During the events of the "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" over the registration of super-powered individuals, Blade registers and begins cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> This alliance allowed Blade access to S.H.I.E.L.D. tech, gaining himself a "gun hand" to replace his missing one.

==Powers and abilities==
===Comics===
Due to an enzyme in his blood stream resultant from his mother's being bitten by a vampire while giving birth to him, Blade possesses a number of superhuman powers.  Blade possesses superhuman strength, stamina, speed, and agility, heightened senses, and a rapid healing factor.  He is immune to the supernatural effects of normal vampire bites, ages very slowly, and can preternaturally sense supernatural activity. 

Blade is an extraordinary martial artist, swordsman, and marksman.   He is a skilled street-fighter and adept in the usage of throwing knives.  He is highly knowledgeable about vampire lore.  He is also an accomplished jazz trumpeter.

===Film and television===
In the films and TV series, Blade is depicted as having all of the vampire strength and none of their weakness-except the thirst. Blade has [[superhuman strength]], speed, stamina, agility, reflexes and senses. He also has a [[healing factor]]. He can walk in sunlight, though it causes some minor discomfort and he likes to wear sunglasses{{Fact|date=November 2007}}.He also ages like a mortal. He is a master of [[martial arts]] and weaponry ranging from his acid-etched titanium sword and glaive to a [[MAC-10]] automatic pistol. Blade can speak [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and to a degree the Vampire language, and he has a great deal of knowledge about hunting vampires.

==Equipment==
{{main|Weaponry of Blade}}
According to his earliest appearances in the original ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' comics, Blade relied on [[teakwood]] [[daggers]] which he used to [[impale]] opponents, and a variety of [[mahogany]] [[stake]]s. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and knife-fighter. Later comics upgraded his arsenal significantly over the years, including a variety of different bladed weapons ranging from long swords to katanas, as well as guns, flamethrowers, and UV and silver-based weapons. He has also had some success with improvised weapons such as stakes made from snapped brooms and, after losing his hand, a replacement appendage made from duct tape and a pointed stick. Blade also had an arsenal of EMP grenades.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Blade===
Although he has only one appearance so far in the Ultimate Universe<ref>Ultimate Spider-Man #94</ref>, he has appeared in [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] in a cameo. Spider-Man stops what he thinks is a robbery but it turns out that Blade is fighting a vampire in an alley-way. Although he is victorious, Blade punches Spider-Man, warns him to never appear in his sight again, and disappears into the night. This version of Blade had numerous small scars across his face.

==In other media==
===Movie trilogy===
{{main|Blade Trilogy|Blade (film)|Blade II|Blade: Trinity}}
[[Image:Blade movie.jpg|thumb|right|Blade movie poster]]
In [[1998 in film|1998]], the [[New Line Cinema]] [[film|movie]] ''Blade'' starred [[Wesley Snipes]] in the title role, [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Abraham Whistler, Blade's mentor, and [[Stephen Dorff]] as Deacon Frost. The film was written by [[David S. Goyer]] and directed by [[Stephen Norrington]]. The film diverges slightly from the comic Blade in the demeanor of the character. Traditionally, Blade was often presented as loquacious and boastful, yet in the film he is stoic and nearly silent. The nature of his abilities is based more on his later titles rather than his original appearances, with him having vampiric powers but none of the inherent weaknesses. The movies  Blade is portrayed  as an [[African-American]] born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. In the Blade  T.V. mini series, his activities take place in Detroit Michigan.

Written by Goyer and directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]], a sequel followed in [[2002 in film|2002]]: ''Blade II''. Blade joins forces with his vampire nemesis Eli Damaskinos to defeat a powerful new breed of vampire called Reapers. The [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''Blade: Trinity'', written and directed by Goyer, introduced heavily modified versions of Hannibal King (played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) and the Nightstalkers. Blade reluctantly joins forces with the group of vampire hunters (led by Abigail Whistler, the estranged daughter of his old mentor) to finally destroy the first vampire.

According to moviebodycounts.com, Blade's personal body count total stands at 172 in the trilogy.

===''Blade: The Series''===
{{main|Blade: The Series}}
A television series, based on the films, aired on [[Spike TV]] and stared rapper/actor [[Kirk Jones]] as Blade. Set some time after the events of ''Blade: Trinity'', the series dealt with Blade fighting an evil vampire named Marcus Van Sciver in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], which is also Blade's birthplace (in the series). As was shown in the movies, Blade's birth name is Eric Brooks and his mother was named Vanessa and now it has been revealed that Blade's father is named Robert Brooks, and that he raised Blade until he was twelve and his vampiric nature became more apparent, such as with his "thirst" for human blood.

Conflicts often come up between Whistler's explanation of Blade's origin in the movie and the explanation of Blade's origin in the television series.

===''Spider-Man: The Animated Series''===
[[Image:Spidermanep22.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Animated Blade]]
Blade appeared in a 1996 episode of the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|Spider-Man animated series]], "Neogenic Nightmare: Chapter 9: Blade the Vampire Hunter". This episode also introduced Whistler, a character (who would later be introduced into the [[New Line Cinema]] movies) not previously seen in the ''Blade'' mythos. Here Blade hunts Morbius, and in this version of his origin, he was the son of a vampire man and a human woman, whose mother left him in foster care after she was bitten by a vampire. Blade and Morbius both also appear in the following episode, "The Immortal Vampire".

In the season-four episode "[[The Vampire Queen (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|Partners in Danger: Chapter 7: The Vampire Queen]]", Blade hunts the Vampire Queen, who he then learns is his mother. Blade make his final appearance in the show in the season-five episode "[[Secret Wars (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|Secret Wars: Chapter 2: Gauntlet of the Red Skull]]", where he teams with Morbius and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] against the Vampire Queen.

In all these appearances, Blade was voiced by [[J.D. Hall]], and wore a costume based on his appearance in the ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]'' comic book series and subsequently. The ''Spider-Man'' incarnation of Blade was notably lighter skinned than in the comic and lacked most, if not all, of the racial characteristics common to the show's African-American cast.

===Video games===
* Blade is playable in the movie-based ''Blade'' (for the [[PlayStation]]) and ''Blade II'' (for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox]]).

* Blade is a playable character in the multi-platform [[action role-playing game]] ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Khary Payton]]. He is playable once you save him from a toy machine in [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]'s Murderworld. His costumes include the classic, Ultimate, Nightstalker, and Daywalker variations. He has special dialogue with [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] (when Mandarin is defeated) and [[Volla (Marvel Comics)|Volla]]. A simulation disk has Blade defending [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] from Dark [[Spider-Man]] in [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] Realm.

* Blade is an unlockable character in the ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|movie-based]] ''[[Ghost Rider (video game)|Ghost Rider]]. He unlocks after you beat the game on "forgiving" difficulty level.

* Khary Payton reprises his role of Blade who appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]],'' in a costume similar to that in the [[Blade: The Series|Blade television series]].
