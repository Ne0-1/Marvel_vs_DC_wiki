'''Blade''' ('''Eric Brooks''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]]/[[vampire hunter]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciller]] [[Gene Colan]], his [[first appearance]] was in the [[comic book]] ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10 (July 1973) as a supporting character.

The character went on to alternatively star and co-star in several comic book series as well as a [[Blade (film series)|film]] and [[Blade: The Series|television series]]. Actor [[Wesley Snipes]] portrayed the vampire hunter throughout the film series while [[Sticky Fingaz|Kirk "Sticky Fingaz" Jones]] took on the role for the television series.

==Publication history==
Blade was introduced as a supporting character in Marvel Comics' ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10 (July 1973), written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciller|penciled]] by [[Gene Colan]]. The artist recalled in 2003, "Marv told me Blade was a black man, and we talked about how he should dress, and how he should look – very heroic looking. That was my input. [...] The bandoleer of blades – that was Marv's idea. But, I dressed him up. I put the leather jacket on him and so on".<ref name=cba>{{cite web|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13colan.html |title=Gene Colan interview, '&#39;Comic Book Artist'&#39; #13 (May 2001) |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=2001-02-18 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}</ref> Colan based the character's features on "a composite of black actors" including [[National Football League|NFL]] football star-turned-actor [[Jim Brown]].<ref name=cba />  In this first appearance, he is referred to as "Blade - the vampire killer".  He sported a 1970's style [[afro]] and wielded [[teak]] bladed knives.

Blade appeared in most issues #10–21, with additional appearances in #24 and 28 (altogether ranging from July 1973 – Sept. 1974). He then fought the scientifically created vampire [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] in the latter's series in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #24 (Oct. 1974), in a story written by [[Steve Gerber]] and penciled by [[P. Craig Russell]].

Blade's first solo story came in Marvel's black-and-white [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics magazine ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #8 (Dec. 1974), in an 11-page story by Wolfman and penciller-inker [[Tony DeZuniga]]. This feature continued in the following issue (Feb. 1975), with Wolfman and [[Chris Claremont]] co-scripting. Blade then appeared in a 56-page solo story in the black-and-white showcase magazine ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #3 (Sept. 1975), written by Claremont, with two chapters each drawn by DeZuniga and by Rico Rival. A six-page backup story by Wolfman and Colan followed in ''Marvel Preview'' #8 (Fall 1976).

Blade next came into prominence in the 1990s, beginning with ''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' #28 (Aug. 1992), in the [[Midnight Sons]] imprint that included issues of ''[[Darkhold|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins]]'', ''Ghost Rider'', ''Ghost Rider / [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Blaze]]: Spirits of Vengeance'', ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'',  ''[[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]]'', and ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''. Blade co-starred in the 18-issue ''Nightstalkers'', and appeared with that team in a story in the [[anthology]] ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #1 (April 1993). He appeared in two solo stories in ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #2 and 7 (July 1993 and Oct. 1994).

Following the cancellation of ''Nightstalkers'', Blade debuted in his first color-comics series, ''Blade: The Vampire Hunter'' #1–10 (July 1994 – April 1995), written by [[Ian Edginton]] (with the last two issues by [[Terry Kavanagh]]) and penciled by [[Doug Wheatley]]. Blade next appeared in a 12-page inventory story in issue #1 (Feb. 1997) of the short-lived black & white anthology series ''Marvel: Shadows and Light''. He then starred again in two solo one-shots: ''Blade: Crescent City Blues'' (March 1998), by writer [[Christopher Golden]] and penciller co-creator Colan, and ''Blade: Sins of the Father'' (Oct. 1998), by writer [[Marc Andreyko]] and penciller Bart Sears.

Marvel next announced a six-issue [[miniseries]], ''Blade'' (storyline: "Blade: Blood Allies") by writer [[Don McGregor]] and penciller Brian Hagen, but only #1–3 (Nov. 1998 – Jan. 1999) were published. Marvel published a different six-issue miniseries later that year, ''Blade: Vampire Hunter'' (storyline: "Chaos (A)"; Dec. 1999 – May 2000), written and, except the last two issues, penciled by Bart Sears.
<!--The following guest appearances can go as footnotes in FCB:
Blade, additionally, guest-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 2, #7 (March 1998), and ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #7-8 (July-Aug. 1999)-->

The next ongoing series, ''Blade'' vol. 2, by writer [[Christopher Hinz]] and artist [[Steve Pugh]], ran six issues, published by [[Marvel MAX]] in 2002. ''Blade'' vol. 3, by writer [[Marc Guggenheim]] and penciller-inker [[Howard Chaykin]], ran 12 issues (Sept. 2006 – Aug. 2007). The final two pages of the last issue were drawn by co-creator Colan.

Blade also starred in two promotional comic books: ''Blade ½'' (1999) by writer-artist Sears and inker [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], bundled with issues of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Comic Magazine]]'' #2000; and ''Blade: Nightstalking'' (2005), a 22-page story by writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and Justin Gray and penciller [[Amanda Conner]], based on [[New Line Cinema]]'s ''[[Blade (film series)|Blade]]'' films, and bundled with the ''Blade Trinity Deluxe Edition'' [[DVD]]. Additionally, the second ''Blade'' movie was adapted as the Marvel comic ''Blade 2: Bloodhunt – The Official Comic Adaptation'' (April 2002) by writers [[Steve Gerber]] and [[David S. Goyer]] and penciller-inker Alberto Ponticelli.

Blade joined the cast of ''[[Captain Britain and MI13|Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' beginning with issue #5 (Nov. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and career===
[[Image:blademu2.png|thumb|''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973). Painted cover art by [[Gray Morrow]].]]

Blade was born in a [[brothel|whorehouse]] in the [[Soho]] neighbourhood of [[London]], [[England]] in 1929.<ref name="mpreview">''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973), with story panels at [http://members.aol.com/Erommel43/bladeorigin1.htm "The Origin of Blade", by Mike Rickard].</ref>
Blade's mother, Tara Brooks, was a prostitute at Madame Vanity's Brothel. When his mother experienced severe labor complications, a doctor was summoned who was in actuality [[Deacon Frost]], a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] who feasted on her during Blade's birth and killed her. However, this inadvertently passed along certain enzymes in his own blood to the infant. This resulted in Blade's quasi-vampiric abilities, including a greatly prolonged lifespan and the ability to sense supernatural creatures, as well as an immunity to complete vampirism. Brooks' fellow [[prostitution|prostitutes]] drove off Frost before he could kill the infant as well.

Blade grew up living at Madame Vanity's, and at age nine, returning home from school one December, he saw an old man being attacked by three vampires. Blade helped the old man, who used a silver cane to kill the vampires and fight off the attackers. The man was [[Jamal Afari]], a [[jazz]] [[trumpet]]er and vampire-hunter who then moved into Madame Vanity's and trained the young Blade in both music and combat. Blade was soon able to defeat many of the weak, younger vampires that he and Afari found in abundance.<ref name="mpreview"/> Blade became an Olympic-level athlete and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, with an expertise in edged weapons such as [[knife|knives]] and [[dagger]]s.

However, Blade's victories made him cocky. He joined a street gang, the Bloodshadows,<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/bloodshadowsblade.htm Bloodshadows] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> headed by a much older and more powerful vampire than any Blade had met before, named Lamia. Blade barely defeated Lamia, and, in doing so, lost his girlfriend Glory. However, the tragedy of the experience left Blade more determined than ever to dedicate his life to the complete extermination of vampires.

Afari himself later fell prey to [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], the first occurrence in an ongoing battle between Dracula and Blade.<ref name="Tomb30">''The Tomb of Dracula'' #30 (March 1975)</ref> Blade slew the vampire Afari and tracked Dracula back to [[Europe]], [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and [[Asia]], staking him many times, but never completely destroying him.<ref>''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10</ref> In [[China]], Blade joined Ogun Strong's vampire hunters,<ref name="Tomb30"/> which included Azu, Orji, and Musenda. Together, they staked Dracula again. Dracula survived, and killed all the hunters except Blade and Musenda (who eventually retired from vampire hunting). Orji had created a lasting impression on Blade with his use of wooden daggers to combat vampires, leading to Blade adopting that weapon as his preferred arms. Consumed by grief for his fallen comrades, Blade resumed his quest alone.

===Quincy Harker's vampire-hunters===
[[Image:blademu3.png|thumb|left|''Nightstalkers''#3 (Jan. 1993): The "revamped" costume: Cover art by [[Ron Garney]] & [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].]]
Blade eventually located Dracula in Paris, where he first encountered the vampire hunter [[Quincy Harker]] (son of [[Jonathan Harker]]), whom he knew by reputation, and Harker's vampire hunters: [[Rachel van Helsing]] (great-granddaughter of [[Abraham Van Helsing]]), Taj Nital, and [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]].<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #12-14</ref> Because of his mercurial temperament, Blade had a strained but steady relationship with the group, allying himself with them on several occasions.

Later, after an unsuccessful battle with Dracula,<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #17</ref> Blade realized he was immune to turning from a vampire's bite.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #19</ref> Armed with this knowledge, he parted company with Harker<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #21</ref> and went after Deacon Frost alone. Blade later battled Dracula in London,<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #24</ref> as well as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]],<ref>''Fear'' #24</ref> and the Legion of the Dead,<ref>''Vampire Tales'' #8-9</ref> who framed him for murder.<ref name="mpreview"/> Blade also destroyed a band of vampire children.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #8</ref>

Blade's hunt for his mother's killer led him to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where he again encountered Harker's crew,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} now temporarily allied with Dracula against a larger threat, [[Doctor Sun]]. Following this battle, Dracula withdrew, and Blade again set out on his own.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #41-42</ref>

He eventually encountered [[Hannibal King]], a [[private investigator|private detective]] whom Deacon Frost had turned into a vampire.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #45</ref> While initially distrusting King, Blade teamed up with him to hunt Frost. Blade and King fought together against Blade's evil [[doppelgänger]], who absorbed the real Blade. King enlisted the help of Daimon Hellstrom, the so-called [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]], who exorcised Blade from the doppelgänger and killed it with King's help. Blade and King eventually caught up with Frost, who had created an army of vampiric doppelgängers, one for each of his victims. Together, they shut down Frost for good, destroying Frost, and forging a lasting friendship.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #48 - #53</ref>

Blade, Rachel van Helsing, and [[Harold H. Harold]] later confronted Dracula.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #54</ref> Blade also saved Musenda's wife from becoming a vampire.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #58</ref>

===The Nightstalkers===
{{Main|Nightstalkers (comics)}}
In later years, Blade, along with King and Drake, became a frequent ally of the [[wikt:sorcerer|sorcerer]] [[Doctor Strange]], and the three assisted Strange in battles with Dracula and the [[Darkhold]]ers and assisted in the casting of the Montesi Formula, which for a time destroyed all vampires on Earth.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #59-62</ref> Blade, King, and Drake then formed the private detective agency Borderline Investigations Inc., to combat supernatural threats. Alongside Doctor Strange, the three detectives battled the Darkholders again.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #67</ref> Blade also rescued his close friend Safron Caulder from the Darkholders.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #64</ref>

The agency discontinued after Drake left and Blade was committed to a psychiatric hospital following a battle with a temporarily resurrected [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Doctor Strange later arranged the release of Blade so that he could join Drake and King in reforming Borderline Inc. as the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]. Blade, King, and Drake were hired by the demonic [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]] to kill the second [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and the non-powered [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]].  The three Nightstalkers battled Meatmarket.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1</ref> The Nightstalkers then teamed with Ghost Rider, Blaze, Morbius, Doctor Strange, and the [[Darkhold Redeemers]] to battle Lilith and her Lilin.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #31</ref> The Nightstalkers also battled other threats, such as [[HYDRA]]'s DOA.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #2-4</ref>

Upon the eventual weakening of the Montesi Formula, and the return of vampires, Blade encountered and staked a former ally, a now-vampiric Taj Nital, and survived a battle with the vampire lord [[Varnae]] in which Drake and King appeared to have been killed.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #18 (April 1994)</ref>

===Daywalker===
[[Image:blademu4.png|thumb|''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8 (Aug. 1999): Morbius transforms Blade into a Daywalker. Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]] & Scott Hanna.]]
A solo vampire-hunter once again, Blade briefly joined forces with the mystic [[John Carik|Bible John Carik]], and encountered a vampire impersonating [[Deacon Frost]] and a once-again resurrected Dracula. Later, in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], Blade discovered that [[Hannibal King]] had survived, and the two joined forces to defeat a genuinely resurrected Frost. Blade remained active in New Orleans, defeating the vampire Ulysses Sojourner and his own former ally, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]], who was under Sojourner's mental thrall. Blade followed Morbius to New York, where, while teamed with [[Spider-Man]], Blade was bitten by Morbius.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> Blade's blood enzymes reacted unexpectedly with Morbius's unique form of [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampirism]] to grant Blade many vampire strengths while eliminating weaknesses inherent to a vampire, most notably the weakness to sunlight. It was at this time that Blade assumed the unofficial title of "Daywalker" among his prey.

The [[United Nations]]-sanctioned [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sought to use Blade's blood for Project: Silvereye, an attempt at cloning vampire operatives. Blade and the vampire-hunting twins Mosha and Mikado shut down the project. Blade later joined Noah Van Helsing (actually Noah Tremayne, Rachel Van Helsing's adopted cousin) and several vampire hunters worldwide to stop Dracula from becoming a genuinely god-like vampire lord. Blade then returned to New Orleans.

Blade reencountered Dracula, and appeared to fully destroy the vampire once again, aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] ''Pericles V''. Unbeknownst to Blade, his wealthy father, Lucas Cross, had been responsible for Dracula's most recent resurrection. Cross later kidnapped Blade and attempted to force Blade to feed on a [[virginity|virgin]] girl; in an attempt to fulfill a prophecy. Blade escaped after biting through his own hand. Later, Blade would feed on a virgin after biting an evil vampire [[priest]], Draconis.<ref>''Blade'' #8</ref>

In exchange for undertaking a [[time travel]] adventure for the [[supervillain]] [[Doctor Doom]], Blade received from Doom an [[wikt:elixir|elixir]] that would purportedly cure a vampire of thirst for human blood but would also remove the bloodlust vampire hunters get for killing the undead. At the end of the series, Blade gave Hannibal King the elixir. During this time travel mission, Blade fulfilled another part of the prophecy by freeing his imprisoned father.

===Civil War and beyond===
During the events of the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" over the registration of superpowered individuals, Blade registers and begins cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> This alliance allowed Blade access to S.H.I.E.L.D. tech, gaining himself a "gun hand" to replace his missing one. Blade completes a prophecy he believes would give all extant vampires back their souls, but which instead returns to existence every vampire that had ever been killed.<ref>''Blade'' #12</ref>

Blade next leads a group of superhuman black-ops agents funded secretly by the U.S. government, called the [[Vanguard (team)|Vanguard]],<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' vol. 2, #5</ref> of which even the president is unaware. During his time with this squad, Blade receives  a cybernetic replacement hand. The squad disbands after their cover is compromised, and Blade returns home to the [[United Kingdom]] to join [[MI-13 (comics)|MI: 13]] in its fight against supernatural evil.<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[Captain Britain and MI13|Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' #5</ref> However, he soon afterward stakes his new teammate, the vampire hero [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Soon after Blade and Spitfire clashed again with each other in a fierce battle, but the two were forced to work together and seemed to have formed an unlikely friendship. Upon completing their first mission together Blade attempts to apologize to Spitfire for trying to kill her but before he could finish she kisses him.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #9</ref>

During the ''[[Curse of the Mutants]]'' storyline, Blade appears in San Francisco to assist the X-Men in capturing a vampire specimen for the X-Club. He confirms Dracula's death and reveals that his son Xarus is the new lord of vampires, having united all of the vampire sects under a single flag. He immediately objects to Cyclops's plan to resurrect Dracula stating "You don't dig up Hitler to get rid of Saddam Hussein".<ref>''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #2</ref> After the conflict has been concluded - with Dracula being resurrected despite Blade's objections - Blade attempts to kill the now-vampire [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. He is forced to withdraw after a stand-off with Wolverine, who refuses to allow her to be staked, even as Blade warns the X-Men that they will eventually have to kill her.<ref>''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Comics===
Due to an enzyme in his blood stream resultant from his mother's being bitten by a vampire while giving birth to him, Blade is immune to the bites of typical, supernatural vampires. At certain instances he also appeared immune to vampire hypnosis as well.  He lacked superhuman physical attributes, however, and relied solely on his considerable skill and determination until [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], an atypical, scientifically created vampire, bit him and Blade was turned into something resembling a [[dhampir]].  Blade possesses superhuman strength, stamina, speed, agility, heightened senses, and a rapid healing factor that attacks any alien substances (chemicals/viruses) in his body and eliminates any chance of him being rendered helpless or maimed from the inside and is unaffected by daylight and most other traditional vampire weaknesses.  He also ages very slowly (although he's not immortal) and can preternaturally sense supernatural activity.

Blade is a master martial artist, swordsman, marksman and street-fighter. He is adept in the usage of throwing knives.  He is highly knowledgeable about vampire lore.

===Film and television===
In the films and the TV series, Blade's origin is set out of Detroit, Michigan.  Blade is depicted as having all of a vampire's strengths and none of the weaknesses except for blood-thirst. Blade attempts to suppress the thirst with a serum, but during the first film his body develops a resistance to it (the serum was presumably improved in the sequels). He is completely immune to silver, garlic and sunlight. Blade has [[superhuman strength]], speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses. He also has a [[healing factor]]. It is also mentioned in the first film that he ages like a human, while vampires age much slower. He is a master of [[martial arts]], and can speak [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and to a degree the Vampire language, and he has a great deal of knowledge about hunting vampires.

===Anime===
In the fourth of four anime series of the [[Marvel Anime]] project, Blade uses the three secret techniques of the [[Yagyū Shinkage-ryū|Yagyū]] style taught to him during his youth. These include '''''The First Blade: Savage Moon''''', in which he draws a circle with his blade, creating an after-image to deliver a fatal blow, and '''''The Second Blade: Phantom Moon''''', in which Blade rotates at high speed, unleashing a fast barrage of slashes. The third technique, which can only be accomplished by mastery of the first two and inner growth, is '''''The Third Blade: Chaotic Moon'''''. Blade use flames akin to aura which surround the target and attack from multiple directions. If one of them hits the target, it allows Blade to successfully strike with his sword. Blade can also slash the air with his sword, unleashing powerful wind blades.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}

==Equipment==
===Comics===
According to his earliest appearances in the original ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' comics, Blade relied on [[teak]]wood [[dagger]]s which he used to [[impalement|impale]] opponents, and a variety of [[mahogany]] [[wikt:stake#Noun|stakes]]. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and knife-fighter. Later comics upgraded his arsenal significantly over the years, including a variety of different bladed weapons ranging from long swords to katanas, as well as guns, flamethrowers, and UV and silver-based weapons. He relies mainly on a double edged sword he carries on his back. He has also had some success with improvised weapons such as stakes made from snapped brooms and, after losing his hand, a replacement appendage made from duct tape and a pointed stick. He would replace this with a new [[machine gun]]-esque firearm used in place of his missing hand, which responds to different muscle twitches as an indication of reloading and firing, among other functions (including a grappling hook, which Blade describes as his 'favorite feature'). It also uses three different kinds of ammo. This weapon was created by S.H.I.E.L.D. Blade also had an arsenal of EMP grenades.

===Film and television===
Much in the same way as in the comics,<ref>http://withfriendship.com/images/d/18984/Blade-comics-image.jpg Blade's model sheet in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, 1989 update, shows him clearly wearing his trademark sword on his back</ref> in the movie series, Blade employs a stylized double edge sword as one of his main offense and defense tools. Although not much detail is specified in the comics about the composition of the sword, in the films, it is equipped with an acid-etched titanium blade, that has a security feature that will release blades into the wielder's hand after a set time. This is aborted by Blade, or others, who knew of the system by pushing a hidden switch in the sword's [[Sword#Hilt|hilt]]. The movies also depict him wielding varieties of throwable [[glaive]]s, different knives, silver stakes, firearms. He also uses specialized weapons, such as throwable injector canisters filled with anticoagulant which is explosively lethal to vampires and extendable injector spikes worn on the back of the hand.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
Nick Fury explained to Blade and those who joined the resistance aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier how serious he believed the situation to be; that it was the end of the world. He also explained that whatever the histories of those assembled, they were all on the same side.{{issue|date=May 2011}} However, Blade was later seen as one of the infected heroes.{{issue|date=May 2011}}

===Ultimate Blade===
An [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universe]] Blade of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint]] appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #95, and had a cameo in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up|Ultimate Spider-Man Special]]''. This version, called "The [[#Daywalker|Daywalker]]" by the [[Daily Bugle|Bugle]], has numerous small scars across his eyes and cheeks.

Spider-Man met Blade when he was hunting a vampire in an alley.  Believing Blade to be a crazed gunman, Spider-Man webbed him and tended to a person who he thought was an ordinary civilian, until the vampire attacked him. Blade freed himself and staked the creature, saving Spider-Man from being bitten.  Blade then threatened Spider-Man with his far superior strength and menacing vampiric appearance, that if he ever attacked him again, he would "eat [his] heart for breakfast!" Shaken by this encounter, Spider-Man later took Blade's discarded wooden stake as a [[wikt:memento|memento]] of his discovery of the existence of vampires.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Super Special #1 and ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #95</ref>

Blade is one of the many heroes recruited by Nick Fury in [[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Spidermanep22.jpg|thumb|145px|right|Blade as seen in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]''.]]
* Blade appeared in the [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|''Spider-Man'' animated series]] episode "Neogenic Nightmare: Chapter 9: Blade the Vampire Hunter" voiced by [[J. D. Hall]]. He was shown in a costume based on his appearance in the ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]'' comic book series. This episode also introduced [[Abraham Whistler|Whistler]], a character (who would later be introduced into the [[New Line Cinema]] movies) not previously seen in the ''Blade'' mythos. Here Blade hunts [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], and in this version of his origin, he was the son of a vampire man who had fallen in love with a human woman, the mother left him in foster care before she became a vampire herself. Blade and Morbius both also appear in the following episode, "The Immortal Vampire". Blade is also shown to have a slight love interest in Terri Lee, a detective who frequently works with Spider-Man, though he usually abandons this out of his need for the hunt. In "Partners in Danger, Chapter 7: The Vampire Queen", Blade hunts the Vampire Queen, who he then learns is his mother. Blade made his final appearance in the show in the season five episode "Secret Wars, Chapter 2: Gauntlet of the Red Skull", where he teams with Morbius and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] against the Vampire Queen.

* A [[Blade: The Series|live-action television series based on the films]] aired on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] and starred rapper/actor [[Sticky Fingaz|Kirk Jones]] as Blade. The series dealt with Blade fighting an evil vampire named Marcus Van Sciver in [[Detroit]], which is also Blade's birthplace (in the series). As seen in the movies, Blade's birth name is Eric Brooks and his mother was named Vanessa. It is revealed that Blade's father is named Robert Brooks, and that he raised Blade until he was twelve and elements of his vampiric nature such as his "thirst" for human blood became more apparent. Conflicts often come up between Whistler's explanation of Blade's origin in the movie and the explanation of Blade's origin in the television series.

* As part of a [[Marvel Anime|four-series collaboration]] between the Japanese [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] animation house and Marvel, Blade will star in a 12-episode (first season) Japanese [[anime]] series that will premiere in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-08-25/iron-man-wolverine-in-marvel-madhouse-1st-tv-anime | title=Iron Man, Wolverine in Marvel, Madhouse's 1st TV Anime (Updated) | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=August 25, 2008 | accessdate=December 29, 2008}}</ref> It will air in the United States in 2011 on [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-23/marvel-anime-to-run-on-g4-in-the-united-states | title=Marvel Anime to Run on G4 in the United States | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=July 23, 2010 | accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref>  He will be voiced by Lost's [[Harold Perrineau]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Films===
{{Main|Blade (film series)|Blade (film)|Blade II|Blade: Trinity}}
[[Image:Blade movie.jpg|thumb|right|Blade movie poster]]
* In [[1998 in film|1998]], the [[New Line Cinema]] film ''Blade'' starred [[Wesley Snipes]] in the title role; [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[Abraham Whistler]], Blade's mentor; and [[Stephen Dorff]] as [[Deacon Frost]]. The film was written by [[David S. Goyer]] and directed by [[Stephen Norrington]]. The film diverges almost entirely from prior comic representations of Blade, completely revamping the character's demeanor, powers and weaknesses. Traditionally, Blade was often presented as loquacious and boastful, yet in the film he is stoic and nearly silent. Rather than a normal human with immunity to vampirism and vampire hypnosis solely reliant on skill and ruthlessness, he is a superhuman with vampiric powers but none of the inherent weaknesses, with the exception of their thirst. To suppress his thirst, Whistler developed a serum, the original version being implied to be based on garlic and silver. The movie version of Blade is portrayed as an [[African American]] born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], whereas the comic-books placed his birth in England. In the Blade TV series, his activities take place in Detroit.

* The [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''Blade: Trinity'', written and directed by Goyer, introduced heavily modified versions of Hannibal King (played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) and the Nightstalkers.
