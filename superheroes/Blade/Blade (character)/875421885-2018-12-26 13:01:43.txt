'''Blade''' ('''Eric Brooks''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciller]] [[Gene Colan]], his [[first appearance]] was in the [[comic book]] ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10 (July 1973) as a [[supporting character]].

The character was portrayed by [[Wesley Snipes]] in the films ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', ''[[Blade II]]'' and ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' and by [[Sticky Fingaz|Kirk Jones]] in the television series ''[[Blade (TV series)|Blade]]'', both set in the [[Blade (franchise)|Blade franchise]].

==Publication history==
Blade was introduced as a supporting character in Marvel Comics' ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10 (July 1973), written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciller|penciled]] by [[Gene Colan]]. The artist recalled in 2003, "Marv told me Blade was a black man, and we talked about how he should dress, and how he should look – very heroic looking. That was my input. [...] The bandolier of blades – that was Marv's idea. But, I dressed him up. I put the leather jacket on him and so on".<ref name=cba>{{cite web|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13colan.html |title=Gene Colan interview, '&#39;Comic Book Artist'&#39; #13 (May 2001) |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=2001-02-18 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}</ref> Colan based the character's features on "a composite of black actors" including [[National Football League|NFL]] football star-turned-actor [[Jim Brown]].<ref name=cba /> He initially sported 1970s style [[afro]] hair and wielded [[teak]] bladed knives. Blade appeared in most issues #10–21, with additional appearances in #24 and 28 (altogether ranging from July 1973 – Sept. 1974).

Wolfman recalled in 2009,
{{quote|I knew if I let him, Blade would eclipse the other characters so I pulled him back and let original supporting characters [[Rachel van Helsing|Rachel]], [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank]] and [[Quincy Harker|Quincy]] shine. I also wasn't happy with my Blade dialogue, so I pulled him out of the book for awhile — I think almost a year — and when I brought him back I played him a bit straighter. The early Blade dialogue was cliche 'Marvel Black' dialogue. Later on, I tried to make him more real. But it took growing up as a writer.<ref name=spotlight2009>{{cite news | authorlink= Robert Greenberger | first=Robert | last= Greenberger | title= Inside the Tome of Dracula | work = Marvel Spotlight: Marvel Zombies Return | year = 2009 | page = 28 (unnumbered) }}</ref>}}

Outside ''Tomb of Dracula'', he fought the scientifically created vampire [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] in the latter's series in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #24 (Oct. 1974), in a story written by [[Steve Gerber]] and penciled by [[P. Craig Russell]].

Blade's first solo story came in Marvel's black-and-white [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics magazine ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #8 (Dec. 1974), in an 11-page story by Wolfman and penciller-inker [[Tony DeZuniga]]. This feature continued in the following issue (Feb. 1975), with Wolfman and [[Chris Claremont]] co-scripting. Blade then appeared in a 56-page solo story in the black-and-white showcase magazine ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #3 (Sept. 1975), written by Claremont, with two chapters each drawn by DeZuniga and by Rico Rival. A six-page backup story by Wolfman and Colan followed in ''Marvel Preview'' #8 (Fall 1976).

Blade next came into prominence in the 1990s, beginning with ''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' #28 (Aug. 1992), in the [[Midnight Sons]] imprint that included issues of ''[[Darkhold|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins]]'', ''Ghost Rider'', ''Ghost Rider / [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Blaze]]: Spirits of Vengeance'', ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'', ''[[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]]'', and ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''. Blade co-starred in the 18-issue ''Nightstalkers'', and appeared with that team in a story in the [[anthology]] ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #1 (April 1993). He appeared in two solo stories, in ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #2 and 7 (July 1993 and Oct. 1994).

Following the cancellation of ''Nightstalkers'', Blade debuted in his first color-comics series, ''Blade: The Vampire Hunter'' #1–10 (July 1994 – April 1995), written by [[Ian Edginton]] (with the last two issues by [[Terry Kavanagh]]) and penciled by [[Doug Wheatley]]. Blade next appeared in a 12-page inventory story in issue #1 (Feb. 1997) of the short-lived black-and-white anthology series ''Marvel: Shadows and Light''. He then starred again in two solo one-shots: ''Blade: Crescent City Blues'' (March 1998), by writer [[Christopher Golden]] and penciller and co-creator Colan; and ''Blade: Sins of the Father'' (Oct. 1998), by writer [[Marc Andreyko]] and penciller Bart Sears.

Marvel next announced a six-issue [[miniseries]], ''Blade'' (storyline: "Blade: Blood Allies") by writer [[Don McGregor]] and penciller Brian Hagen, but only #1–3 (Nov. 1998 – Jan. 1999) were published. Marvel published a different six-issue miniseries later that year, ''Blade: Vampire Hunter'' (storyline: "Chaos (A)"; Dec. 1999 – May 2000), written and, except the last two issues, penciled by Bart Sears.
<!--The following guest appearances can go as footnotes in FCB:
Blade, additionally, guest-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 2, #7 (March 1998), and ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #7-8 (July-Aug. 1999)-->

The next ongoing series, ''Blade'' vol. 2, by writer [[Christopher Hinz]] and artist [[Steve Pugh]], ran six issues, published by [[Marvel MAX]] in 2002. ''Blade'' vol. 3, by writer [[Marc Guggenheim]] and penciller-inker [[Howard Chaykin]], ran 12 issues (Sept. 2006 – Aug. 2007). The final two pages of the last issue were drawn by co-creator Colan.

Blade also starred in two promotional comic books: ''Blade ½'' (1999) by writer-artist Sears and inker [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], bundled with issues of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Comic Magazine]]'' #2000; and ''Blade: Nightstalking'' (2005), a 22-page story by writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and Justin Gray and penciller [[Amanda Conner]], based on [[New Line Cinema]]'s ''[[Blade (film series)|Blade]]'' films, and bundled with the ''Blade Trinity Deluxe Edition'' [[DVD]]. Additionally, the second ''Blade'' movie was adapted as the Marvel comic ''Blade 2: Bloodhunt — The Official Comic Adaptation'' (April 2002) by writers [[Steve Gerber]] and [[David S. Goyer]] and penciller-inker Alberto Ponticelli.

Blade joined the cast of ''[[Captain Britain and MI13|Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' beginning with issue #5 (Nov. 2008).

In 2015, it was announced that Tim Seeley and Logan Faerber would be launching a new ''Blade'' series, starting in October 2015, as part of Marvel's post-''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' relaunch. However this book has since been delayed for an unspecified time.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blade Delayed, For All-New All-Different Marvel|url = http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/08/06/blade-delayed-for-all-new-all-different-marvel/|website = Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{long plot|date=August 2015}}

===Early life and career===
[[File:blademu2.png|thumb|''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1975). Painted cover art by [[Gray Morrow]].]]

Blade (born '''Eric Brooks''') was born in a [[brothel|whorehouse]] in the [[Soho]] neighborhood of [[London]], [[England]] in 1929.<ref name="mpreview">''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973)</ref>
Eric's mother, [[Vanessa Brooks|Tara Brooks]], was a [[prostitution|prostitute]] at Madame Vanity's Brothel. When Tara experienced severe labor complications, a doctor was summoned who was in actuality [[Deacon Frost]], a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] who feasted on her during Eric's birth and killed her. However, this inadvertently passed along certain enzymes in his own blood to the infant. This resulted in Eric's quasi-vampiric abilities, including a greatly prolonged lifespan and the ability to sense supernatural creatures, as well as an immunity to complete vampirism. Brooks' fellow prostitutes drove off Frost before he could kill the infant as well.

Eric grew up living at Madame Vanity's, and at age nine, returning home from school one December, he saw an old man being attacked by three vampires. Eric helped the old man, who used a silver cane to kill the vampires and fight off the attackers. The man was [[Jamal Afari (comics)|Jamal Afari]], a [[jazz]] [[trumpet]]er and vampire hunter who then moved into Madame Vanity's and trained the young Eric in both music and combat. Blade was soon able to defeat many of the weak, younger vampires that he and Afari found in abundance.<ref name="mpreview"/> Eric became an Olympic-level athlete and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, with an expertise in edged weapons such as [[knife|knives]] and [[dagger]]s so notable that it earned him the nickname "Blade" among both his fellow hunters and the vampires they opposed, who began to fear the young hunter.

Blade's victories made him cocky. He joined a street gang, the Bloodshadows,<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/bloodshadowsblade.htm Bloodshadows] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> headed by Cyrus Cutter, later killed by Blade in a knife fight caused by Blade's disapproval of Cutter's actions as leader. Glory Anah, Cutter's girlfriend, later became Blade's. Having gone to London, where for months they hunted vampires, demons, and warlocks, the group encountered a much older and more powerful vampire than any Blade had met before, named Lamia. Blade barely defeated Lamia, with the other members of the group being killed, except Glory, who was turned into a vampire whilst Blade was down. Although Glory subsequently refused to kill Blade in recognition of their relationship, she warned him never to look for her or she would kill him. The tragedy of the experience left Blade more determined than ever to dedicate his life to the complete extermination of vampires.

Afari himself later fell prey to [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], the first occurrence in an ongoing battle between Dracula and Blade.<ref name="Tomb30">''The Tomb of Dracula'' #30 (March 1975)</ref> Blade mercy-killed his mentor after Afari rose as a vampire, and tracked Dracula back to [[Europe]], [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and [[Asia]], staking him many times, but never completely destroying him.<ref>''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10</ref> In [[China]], Blade joined Ogun Strong's vampire hunters,<ref name="Tomb30"/> which included Azu, Orji, and Musenda. Together, they staked Dracula again. Dracula survived, and killed all the hunters except Blade and Musenda, who eventually retired from vampire hunting. Orji had created a lasting impression on Blade with his use of wooden daggers to combat vampires, leading to Blade adopting that weapon as his preferred arms. Consumed by grief for his fallen comrades, Blade resumed his quest alone.

===Quincy Harker's vampire-hunters===
[[File:blademu3.png|thumb|left|''Nightstalkers'' #3 (Jan. 1993): The "revamped" costume. Cover art by [[Ron Garney]] and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].]]
Blade eventually located Dracula in Paris, where he first encountered the vampire hunter [[Quincy Harker]], son of [[Jonathan Harker]], whom he knew by reputation, and Harker's vampire hunters: [[Rachel van Helsing]], great-granddaughter of [[Abraham Van Helsing]]; Taj Nital; and [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]].<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #12-14</ref> Because of his mercurial temperament, Blade had a strained but steady relationship with the group, allying himself with them on several occasions.

Later, after an unsuccessful battle with Dracula,<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #17</ref> Blade realized he was immune to turning from a vampire's bite.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #19</ref> Armed with this knowledge, he parted company with Harker<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #21</ref> and went after Deacon Frost alone. Blade later battled Dracula in London,<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #24</ref> as well as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]],<ref>''Fear'' #24</ref> and the Legion of the Dead,<ref>''Vampire Tales'' #8-9</ref> who framed him for murder.<ref name="mpreview"/> Blade also destroyed a band of vampire children.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #8</ref>

Blade's hunt for his mother's killer led him to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where he allied with Dracula against [[Doctor Sun]].<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #41</ref> Following this battle, Dracula withdrew and Blade again set out on his own.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #42</ref>

He eventually encountered [[Hannibal King]], a [[private investigator|private detective]] whom Deacon Frost had turned into a vampire.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #45</ref> While initially distrusting King, Blade teamed up with him to hunt Frost. Blade and King fought together against Blade's evil [[doppelgänger]], who absorbed the real Blade. King enlisted the help of Daimon Hellstrom, the so-called [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]], who exorcised Blade from the doppelgänger and killed it with King's help. Blade and King eventually caught up with Frost, who had created an army of vampiric doppelgängers, one for each of his victims. Together, they shut down Frost for good, destroying Frost, and forging a lasting friendship.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #48 - #53</ref>

Blade, Rachel van Helsing, and [[Harold H. Harold]] later confronted Dracula.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #54</ref> Blade also saved Musenda's wife from becoming a vampire.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #58</ref>

===The Nightstalkers===
{{Main|Nightstalkers (comics)}}
In later years, Blade, along with King and Drake, became a frequent ally of the [[wikt:sorcerer|sorcerer]] [[Doctor Strange]], and the three assisted Strange in battles with Dracula and the [[Darkhold]]ers and assisted in the casting of the Montesi Formula, which for a time destroyed all vampires on Earth.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #59-62</ref> Blade, King, and Drake then formed the private detective agency Borderline Investigations, Inc. to combat supernatural threats. Alongside Doctor Strange, the three detectives battled the Darkholders again.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #67</ref> Blade also rescued his close friend [[Safron Caulder]] from the Darkholders.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #64</ref>

The agency discontinued after Drake left and Blade was committed to a psychiatric hospital following a battle with a temporarily resurrected [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Doctor Strange later arranged the release of Blade so that he could join Drake and King in reforming Borderline, Inc. as the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]. Blade, King, and Drake were hired by the demonic [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]] to kill the second [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and the non-powered [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]]. The three Nightstalkers battled Meatmarket.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1</ref> The Nightstalkers then teamed with Ghost Rider, Blaze, Morbius, Doctor Strange, and the [[Darkhold Redeemers]] to battle Lilith and her Lilin.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #31</ref> The Nightstalkers also battled other threats, such as [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]'s DOA.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #2-4</ref>

Upon the eventual weakening of the Montesi Formula and the return of vampires, Blade encountered and staked a former ally, a now-vampiric Taj Nital, and survived a battle with the vampire lord [[Varnae]] in which Drake and King appeared to have been killed.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #18 (April 1994)</ref>

===Daywalker===
[[File:blademu4.png|thumb|''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8 (Aug. 1999): Morbius transforms Blade into a Daywalker. Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]] & Scott Hanna.]]
A solo vampire-hunter once again, Blade briefly joined forces with the mystic [[John Carik|Bible John Carik]], and encountered a vampire impersonating [[Deacon Frost]] and a once-again resurrected Dracula. Later, in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], Blade discovered that [[Hannibal King]] had survived, and the two joined forces to defeat a genuinely resurrected Frost. Blade remained active in New Orleans, defeating the vampire Ulysses Sojourner and his own former ally, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]], who was under Sojourner's mental thrall. Blade followed Morbius to New York, where, while teamed with [[Spider-Man]], Blade was bitten by Morbius.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> Blade's blood enzymes reacted unexpectedly with Morbius's unique form of [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampirism]] to grant Blade many vampire strengths while eliminating weaknesses inherent to a vampire, most notably the weakness to sunlight. It was at this time that Blade assumed the unofficial title of "Daywalker" among his prey.

The [[United Nations]]-sanctioned [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sought to use Blade's blood for Project: Silvereye, an attempt at cloning vampire operatives. Blade and the vampire-hunting twins Mosha and Mikado shut down the project. Blade later joined Noah Van Helsing, actually Noah Tremayne, Rachel Van Helsing's adopted cousin, and several vampire hunters worldwide to stop Dracula from becoming a genuinely god-like vampire lord. Blade then returned to New Orleans.

Blade re-encountered Dracula, and appeared to fully destroy the vampire once again, aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] ''Pericles V''. Unbeknownst to Blade, his wealthy father, Lucas Cross, had been responsible for Dracula's most recent resurrection. Cross later kidnapped Blade and attempted to force Blade to feed on a [[virginity|virgin]] girl in an attempt to fulfill a prophecy. Blade escaped after biting through his own hand. Later, Blade would feed on a virgin after biting an evil vampire [[priest]], Draconis.<ref>''Blade'' #8</ref>

In exchange for undertaking a [[time travel]] adventure for the [[supervillain]] [[Doctor Doom]], Blade received from Doom an [[wikt:elixir|elixir]] that would purportedly cure a vampire of thirst for human blood but would also remove the bloodlust vampire hunters get for killing the undead. At the end of the series, Blade gave Hannibal King the elixir. During this time travel mission, Blade fulfilled another part of the prophecy by freeing his imprisoned father.

==="Civil War" and beyond===
During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, in which the superheroes of the Marvel Universe were split over the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Blade registers and begins cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> This alliance allowed Blade access to S.H.I.E.L.D. tech, gaining himself a "gun hand" to replace his missing one. Blade completes a prophecy he believes would give all extant vampires back their souls, but which instead returns to existence every vampire that had ever been killed.<ref>''Blade'' #12</ref>

Blade next leads a group of superhuman black-ops agents funded secretly by the U.S. government, called the [[Vanguard (team)|Vanguard]],<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' vol. 2, #5</ref> of which even the president is unaware. During his time with this squad, Blade receives a cybernetic replacement hand. The squad disbands after their cover is compromised, and Blade returns home to the [[United Kingdom]] to join [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]] in its fight against supernatural evil.<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[Captain Britain and MI13|Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' #5</ref> He soon afterwards stakes his new teammate, the vampire hero [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Blade and Spitfire clashed again with each other in a fierce battle, but the two were forced to work together and seemed to have formed an unlikely friendship. Upon completing their first mission together, Blade attempts to apologize to Spitfire for trying to kill her, but before he could finish she kisses him.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #9</ref>

During the ''[[Curse of the Mutants]]'' storyline, Blade appears in San Francisco to assist the X-Men in capturing a vampire specimen for the X-Club. He confirms Dracula's death and reveals that his son Xarus is the new Lord of Vampires, having united all of the vampire sects under a single flag. He immediately objects to Cyclops's plan to resurrect Dracula stating "You don't dig up [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to get rid of [[Saddam Hussein]]".<ref>''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #2</ref> The conflict concluded with Dracula being resurrected despite Blade's objections. Blade attempts to kill the now-vampire [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], but is forced to withdraw after a stand-off with Wolverine, who refuses to allow her to be staked, even as Blade warns the X-Men that they will eventually have to kill her.<ref>''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'' vol. 3 #5</ref>

Blade was later revealed to have been using the [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]] identity as part of the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] team.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9 (June 2014)</ref>

Blade later appears in a small town hunting down a necromancer and ends up confronting [[Gwenpool]], who was hired to kill him. After Gwenpool explains that the dead residents are living peacefully, Blade leaves after he gives her his cellphone number but is called back when Gwenpool discovers that the mayor/necromancer is actually killing children to keep his undead citizens alive.<ref>''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' Vol. 1 #11</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Blade was shown to have been trapped in Manhattan when it was isolated by a [[Darkforce]] dome. Due to the vampire attacks at the time, Blade takes advantage of this by killing every attacking vampire to protect the humans.<ref>''Secret Empire: Brave New World'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Comics===
Due to an enzyme in his bloodstream resultant from his mother's being bitten by a vampire while giving birth to him, Blade is immune to the bites of typical, supernatural vampires. In certain instances, he also appeared immune to vampire hypnosis as well. He lacked superhuman physical attributes, however, and relied solely on his considerable skill and determination until [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], an atypical, scientifically created vampire, bit him and Blade was turned into something resembling a [[dhampir]]. Blade possesses superhuman strength, stamina, speed, agility, heightened senses, and a rapid healing factor that attacks any alien substances (chemicals/viruses) in his body and eliminates any chance of him being rendered helpless or maimed from the inside and is unaffected by daylight and most other traditional vampire weaknesses. He also ages very slowly (although he is not immortal) and can preternaturally sense supernatural activity.

When he was raised and trained by [[Jamal Afari (comics)|Jamal Afari]], Blade learned everything about vampire lore, from their strengths to their weaknesses, and how he could use his powers and skills to hunt down vampires' so he could fight and kill them.{{issue|date=November 2018}}

Blade is a master martial artist mastering styles like [[boxing]], [[capoeira]], [[escrima]], [[jeet kune do]], [[hapkido]], [[jujutsu]], [[Shotokan karate]], [[kung fu]], and [[ninjutsu]].{{issue|date=July 2014}} He is also a skilled swordsman, marksman, and street-fighter. He is adept in the usage of throwing knives. He is highly knowledgeable about vampire lore as well as the supernatural.

In "Dracula's Gauntlet", Blade and Deadpool are surrounded by monsters and Blade threatens to turn into a bat and leave Deadpool there to die.{{issue|date=February 2017}} He may have all vampire powers, but feel conflicted about using the ones that make him seem less human.{{issue|date=February 2017}}

===Film and television===
In the films and television series, Blade originated from [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. Blade is depicted as having all of a vampire's strengths and none of the weaknesses, except for bloodthirst. Blade attempts to suppress the thirst with a serum, but during the first film his body develops a resistance to it. At the beginning of the second film, it is stated that Dr. Karen Jenson, from the first film, improved the serum, presumably in the time between the two films. Although he does not want to drink blood, he has been shown to be capable of it; prior to the development of the serum, Whistler noted that he found Blade as a teenager when Blade was feeding on the homeless, with Blade ingesting blood during the first and second films when in a position where he was badly injured and needed to be back at full strength as soon as possible.

Blade's half-vampire physiology results in him being completely immune to silver, garlic, and sunlight. Blade has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses. He also has a healing factor that allows him to heal completely from wounds overnight, although in the first and second films he was forced to drink blood to accelerate his usual healing abilities when faced with an immediate threat and too badly injured to confront it on his own. It is also mentioned in the first film that he ages like a human, while vampires age much slower. He is a master of [[martial arts]], practices [[meditation]], and can speak [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and to a degree the vampire language, and he has a great deal of knowledge about hunting vampires. It is seen in the television series that, while he is only half-vampire, Blade's saliva still produces the enzyme that turns humans into vampires.

==Equipment==
===Comics===
According to his earliest appearances in the original ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' comics, Blade relied on [[teak]]wood [[dagger]]s which he used to [[impalement|impale]] opponents, and a variety of [[mahogany]] [[wikt:stake#Noun|stakes]]. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and knife-fighter. Later comics upgraded his arsenal significantly over the years, including a variety of different bladed weapons ranging from long swords to katanas, as well as guns, flamethrowers, and UV and silver-based weapons. He relies mainly on a double edged sword he carries on his back. He has also had some success with improvised weapons such as stakes made from snapped brooms and, after losing his hand, a replacement appendage made from duct tape and a pointed stick. He would replace this with a new [[machine gun]]-esque firearm used in place of his missing hand, which responds to different muscle twitches as an indication of reloading and firing, among other functions (including a grappling hook, which Blade describes as his "favorite feature"). It also uses three different kinds of ammo. This weapon was created by S.H.I.E.L.D. Blade also had an arsenal of EMP grenades.

===Film and television===
Much in the same way as in the comics,<ref>http://withfriendship.com/images/d/18984/Blade-comics-image.jpg Blade's model sheet in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, 1989 update, shows him clearly wearing his trademark sword on his back</ref> in the movie series, Blade employs a stylized double edge sword as one of his main offense and defense tools. Although not much detail is specified in the comics about the composition of the sword, in the films, it is equipped with an acid-etched titanium blade that has a security feature that will release blades into the wielder's hand after a set time. This is aborted by Blade or others who know of the system by pushing a hidden switch in the sword's [[Sword#Hilt|hilt]]. The movies also depict him wielding varieties of throwable "glaives" (boomerang- or chakram-like weapons which return when thrown), different knives, silver stakes, and firearms. He also uses specialized weapons, such as throwable injector canisters filled with anticoagulant which is explosively lethal to vampires, and extendable injector spikes worn on the back of the hand.

===Anime===
In addition to all his above skills and powers, Blade's swordsmanship in particular is shown in ''[[Marvel Anime]]'' to be especially advanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-06-01/blade-fairy-tail-ro-kyu-bu-promo-videos-streamed|title=Blade, Fairy Tail, Ro-Kyu-Bu! Promo Videos Streamed|work=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref> Blade's sword-style revolves mainly around his mastery of Yagu Shinkage-ryu, a kenjutsu art that can unleash powerful shockwaves or transparent wind blades from his sword swings, allowing him to blast or slice respectively his opponents from a distance. The Yagu Shinkage-ryu also has three principle Yagyu techniques. The first technique "The First Blade: Residual Moon", draws a small circle with the tip of his sword, producing a perfectly tangible after-image of himself for diversions. The second technique "The Second Blade: Phantom Moon", involves a high-speed spin, allowing Blade to launch an omnidirectional slash in rapid succession with such intensity that it sets his strike ablaze. The final technique, "The Third Blade: Chaotic Moon", launches several shadow blades around the opponent, hiding the user's attack path with little chance of being noticed.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
Nick Fury explained to Blade and those who joined the resistance aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier how serious he believed the situation to be; that it was the end of the world. He also explained that whatever the histories of those assembled, they were all on the same side. However, Blade was later seen as one of the infected heroes.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #2</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
An [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universe]] Blade of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #95, and had a cameo in the non-canon ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up|Ultimate Spider-Man Special]]''. This version, called "The [[#Daywalker|Daywalker]]" by the [[Daily Bugle|Bugle]], has numerous small scars across his eyes and cheeks.

[[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] met Blade when he was hunting a vampire in an alley. Believing Blade to be a crazed gunman, Spider-Man webbed him and tended to a person who he thought was an ordinary civilian, until the vampire attacked him. Blade freed himself and staked the creature, saving Spider-Man from being bitten. Blade then threatened Spider-Man with his superior strength and menacing vampiric appearance, that if he ever attacked him again, he would "eat [his] heart for breakfast!" Shaken by this encounter, Spider-Man later took Blade's discarded wooden stake as a [[wikt:memento|memento]] of his discovery of the existence of vampires. This experience also later helps him when trying to save [[Ben Urich]] from becoming one.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' Super Special #1 and ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #95</ref>

Blade is one of the many heroes recruited by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]''. When vampires started infecting superheroes, going from street-heroes such as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|the new Daredevil]], to major heroes such as Nerd Hulk, and even [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain Americ]]a, Blade became the center of attention as he infiltrated the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], where he fought the vampire Captain America. After repelling Captain America, Blade was taken into custody by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and interrogated on the nature of the vampires and who was behind this. He explained that this was orchestrated by Anthony, another vampire hunter like Blade, who was turned into a vampire and put his mind and strategy into infecting the superhero community in order to dominate the world. As S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers were preparing to fight against the vampires, Blade was incarcerated below the Triskelion as he couldn't be trusted until the situation is over. When the vampires assaulted the Triskelion, Blade was let out by his handlers in confronting the vampires Daredevil and his former master [[Stick (comics)|Stick]]. He was forced to retreat from the vampires as Stick was armed with [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]]'s armor before being subdued and prepared to be beheaded by Daredevil. Fortunately, a cured Captain America teleported the Triskelion to a daylight [[Iran]] where the vampires were incinerated, saving Blade in the process.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers 3'' #1-6</ref>

Nick Fury managed to convince Blade to join [[Avengers (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|his Avenger]]s by promising to deliver to him the recently captured [[Deacon Frost#Ultimate Marvel|Deacon Frost]], the vampire who killed his mother and is responsible for his condition. While attempting to intervene on an illegal sale of S.H.I.E.L.D. Super-Soldiers, the Avengers were attacked by [[Tyrone Cash]]; however, Blade was able to hypnotize him before he could cause any real threat. Cash revealed that he was working for [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Marvel|Carol Danvers]]. During the main battle between the Avengers and the New Ultimates, Blade managed to capture Danvers briefly before he was intercepted by the Black Widow. Iron Man intervened to help Monica; however, he crushes Blade, not realizing that Blade does not have super-human invulnerability.<ref>''New Ultimates vs Avengers'' #3</ref>

After being arrested by the New Ultimates, Blade and the rest of the Avengers take Tyrone Cash's serum and they gain massive strength and bulk bodies. When they confront [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Gregory Stark|Gregory Stark]], he easily overpowers them with his nanite-based powers and sends them over the edge of the [[USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23)|U.S.S. Jimmy Carter]]. They later join the New Ultimates on their mission to [[South Korea]] to settle the civil unrest which Gregory engineered.<ref>''New Ultimates vs Avengers'' #1-6</ref>

==Marv Wolfman lawsuit==
In 1997, on the eve of the impending release of the [[Blade (film)|''Blade'' motion picture]], [[Marv Wolfman]] sued Marvel Characters Inc. over ownership of all characters he had created for Marvel Comics, including Blade and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]].<ref name=tcj239>{{cite news | url =http://tcj.com/239/n_wolfman.html | title=Post Mortem: Marv Wolfman Talks About His Day in Court| first=Michael | last=Dean| work=[[The Comics Journal]]| issue=239| date= November 2001| publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080510153705/http://tcj.com/239/n_wolfman.html | archivedate=May 10, 2008}}</ref> A ruling in Marvel's favor was handed down on November 6, 2000.<ref name=tcj239 /> Wolfman's stance was that he had not signed work-for-hire contracts when he created characters including Blade and Nova.

===Films===
{{Main|Blade (franchise)|Blade (film)|Blade II|Blade: Trinity}}
[[File:Blade (Wesley Snipes).png|thumb|upright|[[Wesley Snipes]] as the titular character in ''[[Blade (film series)|Blade]]'' film series.]]
* In [[1998 in film|1998]], the [[New Line Cinema]] film ''Blade'' starred [[Wesley Snipes]] in the title role, [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Blade's mentor [[Abraham Whistler]], and [[Stephen Dorff]] as [[Deacon Frost]]. The film was written by [[David S. Goyer]] and directed by [[Stephen Norrington]]. The film diverges almost entirely from prior comic representations of Blade, completely revamping the character's demeanor, powers, and weaknesses. Traditionally, Blade was often presented as loquacious and boastful, yet in the film he is stoic and nearly silent. Rather than a normal human with immunity to vampirism and vampire hypnosis solely reliant on skill and ruthlessness, he is a superhuman with vampiric powers but none of the inherent weaknesses, with the exception of their thirst. To suppress his thirst, Whistler developed a serum, the original version being implied to be based on garlic and silver. The movie version of Blade is portrayed as an [[African American]] born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], whereas the comic-books placed his birth in England. In the ''Blade'' TV series, his activities take place in Detroit.
* Written by Goyer and directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]], a sequel followed in [[2002 in film|2002]]: ''Blade II''. Blade joins forces with vampire overlord Eli Damaskinos to defeat a powerful new breed of vampire called Reapers led by Jared Nomak, revealed over the course of the film to have been the result of Damaskinos attempting to create his own "Daywalkers".
* The [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''Blade: Trinity'', written and directed by Goyer, introduced heavily modified versions of Hannibal King (played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) and the Nightstalkers. Blade reluctantly joins forces with the group of vampire hunters led by Abigail Whistler ([[Jessica Biel]]), the estranged daughter of his old mentor, to destroy the first vampire, [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], who goes by the name "Drake" ([[Dominic Purcell]]), simultaneously using him to disperse a virus that kills vampires in the local area and providing Nightstalkers another means against their enemies.
* In July 2011, Marvel's [[Chief creative officer|CCO]] [[Joe Quesada]] revealed that the rights to the character had reverted to [[Marvel Studios]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In May 2013, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that Marvel had a script for a Blade feature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-cliffhanger-robert-downey-jrs-518837|title=A Spago dinner sets the stage for Downey's epic contract talks that could lead to more "Avengers" and "Iron Man 4" — or a new Tony Stark|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|last2=Bond|first2=Paul|date=May 7, 2013|accessdate=May 8, 2013|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> In July 2015, [[Wesley Snipes]] stated that he had discussions with Marvel to reprise his role.<ref name="SnipesBlade">{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/wesley-snipes-blade-comic-con-interview-blade-the-player-1201472733/ |title=Comic-Con: Wesley Snipes On 'Blade' Marvel Talks, 'The Player' & Spike Lee – Deadline |first=Dominic |last=Patten |date=July 9, 2015 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=July 11, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6a4vgcoMq?url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/wesley-snipes-blade-comic-con-interview-blade-the-player-1201472733/ |archivedate=July 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In October 2016, star of [[Underworld (film series)|''Underworld'' film series]], [[Kate Beckinsale]] stated that the option of a Blade team-up had been discussed, but declined due to the fact that Marvel Studios has plans to use Eric Brooks/Blade in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/blade-marvel-kate-beckinsale/ |title=Kate Beckinsale Says Marvel Is Working On A Blade Project |first=Cooper |last=Hood |date=October 7, 2016 |work=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref> [[Kevin Feige]] later stated that there are currently no immediate plans for the character.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1565300/whats-happening-with-blade-at-marvel-according-to-kevin-feige |title=What's Happening With Blade At Marvel, According To Kevin Feige |first=Dirk |last=Libbey |work=CinemaBlend}}</ref>
