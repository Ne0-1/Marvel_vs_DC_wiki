'''Blade''' ('''Eric Brooks''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] [[vampire hunter]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciller]] [[Gene Colan]], his [[first appearance]] was in the [[comic book]] ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10 (July 1973) as a supporting character. 

The character went on to star or co-star in several comic-book series as well as a [[Blade (film series)|film]] and [[Blade: The Series|television series]]. Actor [[Wesley Snipes]] portrayed the vampire hunter throughout the film series while [[Kirk Jones]] took on the role for the television series.

==Publication history==
Blade was introduced as a supporting character in Marvel Comics' ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10 (July 1973), written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[penciler|penciled]] by [[Gene Colan]]. The artist recalled in 2003, "Marv told me Blade was a black man, and we talked about how he should dress, and how he should look &mdash; very heroic looking. That was my input. [...] The bandoleer of blades &mdash; that was Marv's idea. But, I dressed him up. I put the leather jacket on him and so on".<ref name=cba>[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13colan.html Gene Colan interview, ''Comic Book Artist'' #13 (May 2001)]</ref> Colan based the character's features on "a composite of black actors" including [[NFL]] football star-turned-actor [[Jim Brown]].<ref name=cba />

Blade appeared in most issues from #10-21, with additional appearances in #24 & #28 (altogether ranging from July 1973 - Sept. 1974). He then fought the scientifically created vampire [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] in the latter's series in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #24 (Oct. 1974), in a story written by [[Steve Gerber]] and penciled by [[P. Craig Russell]].

Blade's first solo story came in Marvel's black-and-white [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics magazine ''[[Vampire Tales]]'' #8 (Dec. 1974), in an 11-page story by Wolfman and penciller-inker [[Tony DeZuniga]]. This feature continued in the following issue (Feb. 1975), with Wolfman and [[Chris Claremont]] co-scripting. Blade then appeared in a 56-page solo story in the black-and-white showcase magazine ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #3 (Sept. 1975), written by Claremont, with two chapters each drawn by DeZuniga and by Rico Rival. A six-page backup story by Wolfman and Colan followed in ''Marvel Preview'' #8 (Fall 1976).

Blade next came into prominence in the 1990s, beginning with ''[[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' #28 (Aug. 1992), in the [[Midnight Sons]] imprint that included issues of ''[[Darkhold|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins]]'', ''Ghost Rider'', ''Ghost Rider / [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Blaze]]: Spirits of Vengeance'', ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'',  ''[[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]]'', and ''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]''. Blade co-starred in the 18-issue ''Nightstalkers'', and appeared with that team in a story in the [[anthology]] ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #1 (April 1993). He appeared in two solo stories in ''Midnight Sons Unlimited'' #2 & 7 (July 1993 & Oct. 1994).

Following the cancellation of ''Nightstalkers'', Blade debuted in his first color-comics series, ''Blade: The Vampire Hunter'' #1-10 (July 1994 - April 1995), written by [[Ian Edginton]] (with the last two issues by [[Terry Kavanagh]]) and penciled by [[Doug Wheatley]]. Blade next appeared in a 12-page inventory story in issue #1 (Feb. 1997) of the short-lived black & white anthology series ''Marvel: Shadows and Light''. He then starred again in two solo one-shots: ''Blade: Crescent City Blues'' (March 1998), by writer [[Christopher Golden]] and penciller co-creator Colan, and ''Blade: Sins of the Father'' (Oct. 1998), by writer [[Marc Andreyko]] and penciller Bart Sears.

Marvel next announced a six-issue [[miniseries]], ''Blade'' (storyline: "Blade: Blood Allies") by writer [[Don McGregor]] and penciller Brian Hagen, but only #1-3 (Nov. 1998 - Jan. 1999) were published. Marvel published a different six-issue miniseries later that year, ''Blade: Vampire Hunter'' (storyline: "Chaos (A)"; Dec. 1999 - May 2000), written and, except the last two issues, penciled by Bart Sears.
<!--The following guest appearances can go as footnotes in FCB:
Blade, additionally, guest-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 2, #7 (March 1998), and ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #7-8 (July-Aug. 1999)-->

The next ongoing series, ''Blade'' vol. 2, by writer [[Christopher Hinz]] and artist [[Steve Pugh]], ran six issues. ''Blade'' vol. 3, by writer [[Marc Guggenheim]] and penciller-inker [[Howard Chaykin]], ran 12 issues (Sept. 2006 - Aug. 2007). The final two pages of the last issue were drawn by co-creator Colan.

Blade also starred in two promotional comic books: ''Blade Â½'' (1999) by writer-artist Sears and inker [[Bill Sienkiewicz]], bundled with issues of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Comic Magazine]]'' #2000; and ''Blade: Nightstalking'' (2005), a 22-page story by writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and Justin Gray and penciller [[Amanda Conner]], based on [[New Line Cinema]]'s ''[[Blade (film series)|Blade]]'' films, and bundled with the ''Blade Trinity Deluxe Edition'' [[DVD]]. Additionally, the second ''Blade'' movie was adapted as the Marvel comic ''Blade 2: Bloodhunt - The Official Comic Adaptation'' (April 2002) by writers [[Steve Gerber]] and [[David S. Goyer]] and penciller-inker Alberto Ponticelli.

Blade joined the cast of  ''[[Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' beginning with issue #5 (Nov. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and career===
[[Image:blademu2.png|thumb|''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973). Painted cover art by [[Gray Morrow]].]]

Blade was born in a [[brothel|whorehouse]] in the [[Soho]] neighborhood of [[London]], [[England]] at some time in the late [[nineteenth century]].<ref name="mpreview">''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973), with story panels at [http://members.aol.com/Erommel43/bladeorigin1.htm "The Origin of Blade", by Mike Rickard].</ref> 
Blade's mother, Tara Brooks, was a prostitute at Madame Vanity's Brothel. When his mother experienced severe labor complications, a doctor was summoned who was in actuality [[Deacon Frost]], a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] who feasted on her during Blade's birth and killed her. However, this inadvertently passed along certain enzymes in his own blood to the infant. This resulted in Blade's quasi-vampiric abilities, including a greatly prolonged lifespan and the ability to sense supernatural creatures, as well as an immunity to complete vampirism. Brooks' fellow [[prostitution|prostitutes]] drove off Frost before he could kill the infant as well.

Blade grew up living at Madame Vanity's, and at age nine, returning home from school one December, he saw an old man being attacked by three vampires. Blade helped the old man, who used a silver cane to kill the vampires and fight off the attackers. The man was [[Jamal Afari]], a [[jazz]] [[trumpet]]er and vampire-hunter who then moved into Madame Vanity's and trained the young Blade in both music and combat. Blade was soon able to defeat many of the weak, younger vampires that he and Afari found in abundance.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #3 (Sept. 1973)</ref> Blade became an Olympic-level athlete and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, with an expertise in edged weapons such as [[knife|knives]] and [[dagger]]s.

However, Blade's victories made him cocky. He joined a street gang, the Bloodshadows,<ref> [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/bloodshadowsblade.htm Bloodshadows] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> headed by a much older and more powerful vampire than any Blade had met before, named Lamia. Blade barely defeated Lamia, and, in doing so, lost his girlfriend Glory.

Afari himself later fell prey to [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], the first occurrence in an ongoing battle between Dracula and Blade.<ref>The first battle between Dracula and Blade's original band of vampire hunters recounted in ''The Tomb of Dracula'' #30</ref> Blade slew the vampire Afari and tracked Dracula back to [[Europe]], [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and [[Asia]], staking him many times, but never completely destroying him.<ref>''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #10</ref> In [[China]], Blade joined Ogun Strong's vampire hunters,{{Fact|date=September 2007}} which included Azu, Orji, and Musenda. Together, they staked Dracula again. Dracula survived, and killed all the hunters except Blade and Musenda (who eventually retired from vampire hunting). Orji had created a lasting impression on Blade with his use of wooden daggers to combat vampires, leading to Blade adopting that weapon as his preferred arms. Consumed by grief for his fallen comrades, Blade resumed his quest alone.

===Quincy Harker's vampire-hunters===
[[Image:blademu3.png|thumb|left|''Nightstalkers'' #3 (Jan. 1993): The "revamped" costume: Cover art by [[Ron Garney]] & [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].]]
Blade eventually located Dracula in Paris, where he first encountered the vampire hunter [[Quincy Harker]] (son of [[Jonathan Harker]]), whom he knew by reputation, and Harker's vampire hunters: [[Rachel van Helsing]] (great-granddaughter of [[Abraham Van Helsing]]), Taj Nital, and [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]].<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #12-14</ref> Because of his mercurial temperament, Blade had a strained but steady relationship with the group, allying himself with them on several occasions.

Later, after an unsuccessful battle with Dracula,<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #17</ref> Blade realized he was immune to turning from a vampire's bite.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #19</ref> Armed with this knowledge, he parted company with Harker<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #21</ref> and went after Deacon Frost alone. Blade later battled Dracula in London,<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #24</ref> as well as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]],<ref>''Fear'' #24</ref> and the Legion of the Dead,<ref>''Vampire Tales'' #8-9</ref> who framed him for murder. <ref>''Marvel Preview'' #3</ref> Blade also destroyed a band of vampire children.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #8</ref>

Blade's hunt for his mother's killer led him to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he again encountered Harker's crew,{{Fact|date=September 2007}} now temporarily allied with Dracula against a larger threat, [[Doctor Sun]]. Following this battle, Dracula withdrew, and Blade again set out on his own.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #41-42</ref>

He eventually encountered [[Hannibal King]], a [[private investigator|private detective]] whom Deacon Frost had turned into a vampire.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #45</ref> While initially distrusting King, Blade teamed up with him to hunt Frost. Blade and King fought together against Blade's evil [[doppelgÃ¤nger]], who absorbed the real Blade. King enlisted the help of Daimon Hellstrom, the so-called [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]], who exorcised Blade from the doppelgÃ¤nger and killed it with King's help. Blade and King eventually caught up with Frost, who had created an army of vampiric doppelgÃ¤ngers, one for each of his victims. Together, they shut down Frost for good, destroying Frost, and forging a lasting friendship.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #48 - #53</ref>

Blade, Rachel van Helsing, and [[Harold H. Harold]] later confronted Dracula.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #54</ref> Blade also saved Musenda's wife from becoming a vampire.<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'' #58</ref>

===The Nightstalkers===
{{main|Nightstalkers (comics)}}
In later years, Blade, along with King and Drake, became a frequent ally of the [[wiktionary:sorcerer|sorcerer]] [[Doctor Strange]], and the three assisted Strange in battles with Dracula and the [[Darkhold]]ers and assisted in the casting of the Montesi Formula, which for a time destroyed all vampires on Earth.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #59-62</ref> Blade, King, and Drake then formed the private detective agency Borderline Investigations Inc., to combat supernatural threats. Alongside Doctor Strange, the three detectives battled the Darkholders again.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #67</ref> Blade also rescued his close friend Safron Caulder from the Darkholders.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #64</ref>

The agency discontinued after Drake left and Blade was committed to a psychiatric hospital following a battle with a temporarily resurrected [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Doctor Strange later arranged the release of Blade so that he could join Drake and King in reforming Borderline Inc. as the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]. Blade, King, and Drake were hired by the demonic [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]] to kill the second [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and the non-powered [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]].  The three Nightstalkers battled Meatmarket.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #1</ref> The Nightstalkers then teamed with Ghost Rider, Blaze, Morbius, Doctor Strange, and the [[Darkhold#Midnight Sons|Darkhold Redeemers]] to battle Lilith and her Lilin.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #31</ref> The Nightstalkers also battled other threats, such as [[HYDRA]]'s DOA.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #2-4</ref> 

Upon the eventual weakening of the Montesi Formula, and the return of vampires, Blade encountered and staked a former ally, a now-vampiric Taj Nital, and survived a battle with the vampire lord [[Varnae]] in which Drake and King appeared to have been killed.<ref>''Nightstalkers'' #18 (April 1994)</ref>

===Daywalker===
[[Image:blademu4.png|thumb|''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8 (Aug. 1999): Morbius transforms Blade into a Daywalker. Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]] & Scott Hanna.]]
A solo vampire-hunter once again, Blade briefly joined forces with the mystic [[John Carik|Bible John Carik]], and encountered a vampire impersonating [[Deacon Frost]] and a once-again resurrected Dracula. Later, in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], Blade discovered that [[Hannibal King]] had survived, and the two joined forces to defeat a genuinely resurrected Frost. Blade remained active in New Orleans, defeating the vampire Ulysses Sojourner and his own former ally, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]], who was under Sojourner's mental thrall. Blade followed Morbius to New York, where, while teamed with [[Spider-Man]], Blade was bitten by Morbius.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> Blade's blood enzymes reacted unexpectedly with Morbius's unique form of [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampirism]] to grant Blade many vampire strengths while eliminating weaknesses inherent to a vampire, most notably the weakness to sunlight. It was at this time that Blade assumed the unofficial title of "Daywalker" among his prey.

The [[United Nations]]-sanctioned [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sought to use Blade's blood for Project: Silvereye, an attempt at cloning vampire operatives. Blade and the vampire-hunting twins Mosha and Mikado shut down the project. Blade later joined Noah Van Helsing (actually Noah Tremayne, Rachel Van Helsing's adopted cousin) and several vampire hunters worldwide to stop Dracula from becoming a genuinely god-like vampire lord. Blade then returned to New Orleans.

Blade reencountered Dracula, and appeared to fully destroy the vampire once again, aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] ''Pericles V''. Unbeknownst to Blade, his wealthy father, Lucas Cross, had been responsible for Dracula's most recent resurrection. Cross later kidnapped Blade and attempted to force Blade to feed on a [[virginity|virgin]] girl; in an attempt to fulfill a prophecy. Blade escaped after biting through his own hand. Later, Blade would feed on a virgin after biting an evil vampire [[priest]], Draconis.

In exchange for undertaking a [[time travel]] adventure for the [[supervillain]] [[Doctor Doom]], Blade received from Doom an [[wiktionary:elixir|elixir]] that would purportedly cure a vampire of thirst for human blood but would also remove the bloodlust vampire hunters get for killing the undead. At the end of the series, Blade gave Hannibal King the elixir. During this time travel mission, Blade fulfilled another part of the prophecy by freeing his imprisoned father.

===Civil War and Beyond===
During the events of the "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" over the registration of super-powered individuals, Blade registers and begins cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> This alliance allowed Blade access to S.H.I.E.L.D. tech, gaining himself a "gun hand" to replace his missing one.

The series ended with Blade forced to complete a prophecy he believed would give all extant vampires back their souls, but which instead brought back into existence every vampire that had ever been killed. Blade was next seen leading a group of superhuman government agents, called the [[Vanguard (comics)#Vanguard (team)|Vanguard]]<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' vol. 2, #5</ref>. Blade is shown with a cybernetic replacement hand, and after the group disbands, Blade is taken hostage and tortured. 

Blade is next seen returning home to the United Kingdom in order to join [[MI-13 (comics)|MI: 13]] in their fight against supernatural evil, believing this to currently be a more important battleground. However, when Blade first joins the team he stakes the vampire hero [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]]<ref>''[[Captain Britain & MI: 13]]'' #5</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
===Comics===
Due to an enzyme in his blood stream resultant from his mother's being bitten by a vampire while giving birth to him, Blade is immune to the bites of typical, supernatural vampires. At certain instances he also appeared immune to vampire hypnosis as well.  He lacked superhuman physical attributes, however, and relied solely on his skill and determination until [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]], an atypical, scientifically created vampire, bit him and Blade was turned into something resembling a [[dhampir]].  Blade possesses superhuman strength, stamina, speed, agility, heightened senses, and a rapid healing factor comparable to Morbius' but is unaffected by daylight and most other traditional vampire weaknesses.  He also ages very slowly and can preternaturally sense supernatural activity. 

Blade is an extraordinary martial artist, swordsman, and marksman.   He is a skilled street-fighter and adept in the usage of throwing knives.  He is highly knowledgeable about vampire lore.  He is also an accomplished jazz trumpeter.

===Film and television===
In the films and the TV series, Blade's origin is set out of Detroit Michigan.  Blade is depicted as having all of a vampire's strengths and none of the weaknesses except for blood-thirst. Blade has [[superhuman strength]], speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses. He also has a [[healing factor]]. He can walk in sunlight, as well. He also ages like a mortal. He is a master of [[martial arts]] and weaponry ranging from his acid-etched titanium sword and [[glaive]] to a [[MAC-10]] automatic pistol. Blade can speak [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and to a degree the Vampire language, and he has a great deal of knowledge about hunting vampires.

==Equipment==
According to his earliest appearances in the original ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' comics, Blade relied on [[teak]]wood [[dagger]]s which he used to [[impalement|impale]] opponents, and a variety of [[mahogany]] [[wiktionary:stake#noun|stake]]s. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and knife-fighter. Later comics upgraded his arsenal significantly over the years, including a variety of different bladed weapons ranging from long swords to katanas, as well as guns, flamethrowers, and UV and silver-based weapons. He has also had some success with improvised weapons such as stakes made from snapped brooms and, after losing his hand, a replacement appendage made from duct tape and a pointed stick. Blade also had an arsenal of EMP grenades.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Blade===
An [[alternate universe]] Blade of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint]] appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #95, and had a cameo in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up|Ultimate Marvel Team-Up Super Special]]''. This version, called "The [[Daywalker]]" by the [[Daily Bugle|Bugle]], has numerous small scars across his eyes and cheeks.

==In other media==
===Films===

Blade joins forces with his vampire nemesis Eli Damaskinos to defeat a powerful new breed of vampire called Reapers. The [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''Blade: Trinity'', written and directed by Goyer, introduced heavily modified versions of Hannibal King (played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) and the Nightstalkers. Blade reluctantly joins forces with the group of vampire hunters (led by Abigail Whistler, the estranged daughter of his old mentor) to finally destroy the first vampire, Dracula ("Drake").{{Fact|date=October 2008}}
