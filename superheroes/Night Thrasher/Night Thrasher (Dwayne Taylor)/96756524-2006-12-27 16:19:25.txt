'''Night Thrasher''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #411 and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Overview===
Night Thrasher is the founder and leader of the [[New Warriors]], and head of the Taylor Foundation.  Although he possesses no [[superhuman]] powers, he has trained himself extensively in many [[martial art]]s, and is adept at building technological devices.

Overall Night Thrasher is very similar to [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]], with almost exactly the same origin story (driven to fight crime after parents murdered in front of him as a child) and power set (trained human with gadgets).

In ''[[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]]'' (vol. 2) #29 and ''[[X-Force]]'' (vol. 2) #32, it is revealed that Night Thrasher has ties to a group of rich people, who are one of the X-Men's greatest adversaries, namely the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].

Night Thrasher had two legal guardians when he debuted in the New Warriors' origin issue: Andrew Chord and Tai. Chord has not been seen since mid-volume 1, and Tai died in issue #25 after revealing her plans to use the New Warriors to gain immeasurable power. It is assumed that Night Thrasher has simply outgrown his need for a legal guardian.

===Fictional history===
====''New Warriors'' (vol. 1) and ''Night Trasher''====
=====Origin=====
Dwayne Michael Taylor led a hard life.  As a child, he saw his wealthy parents slain before his very eyes.  This event drove him to hone himself into a human fighting machine in the pursuit of vengeance.  Over time, this desire for revenge later evolved into an obsessive desire to punish all wrongdoers. 

He was unable to fully remember the exact circumstances of his parents' deaths, and was unable to remember the face of their killer, he assumed that this was due to his mind trying to block the memory. Later in life he discovered that the entire circumstances of his parents' death and his own rearing by his guardian Chord and an elderly Oriental woman named Tai, had in fact all been orchestrated by Tai herself.

The driven, and conflicted young man lived a dual existence, during the day he ran the Taylor Foundation, and at night he relentlessly trained himself to human perfection, and studied with the best teachers money could buy. He then began patrolling the streets of New York City, in order to fight crime and to provide a testbed for his skills.

=====Early adventures=====
[[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]] and [[Midnight's Fire]] were operating as independent vigilantes in the streets of [[New York City]] when they met Dwayne who was also doing the same thing but as a solo operative, a short while before he became Night Thrasher. The trio began an organized effort to lessen the influence of New York City [[street gangs]]. Silhouette and Midnight's Fire were the children of '''Andrew Chord''' who was serving at the time as Dwayne's guardian.

Their partnership ended when '''Silhouette''' was shot and paralyzed from the legs down in a sting gone bad. Midnight's Fire blamed Dwayne and became a [[cop killer]] and a [[druglord]] in order to lure Dwayne into a physical confrontation he could not possibly win. Later the partially paralyzed Silhouette reunited with Dwayne, distancing herself from her brother's evil actions.

Dwayne creates a suit of special body armor, partially as a response to the threat of Midnight's Fire who was determined to kill him, and also because he felt it was the most effective way to carry out his mission.

=====The New Warriors=====
Night Thrasher meticulously researched several young solo heroes, and selected a handful of them as targets for recruitment.  The first of which was Richard Rider who was the retired, and supposedly depowered, [[Nova (comics)|Nova]].  Deducing he could reignite Rider's powers with a high stress incident, Night Thrasher abducted Rider and dropped him off a building. Although Rider was understandably upset at Night Thrasher for risking his life, the fact that the incident allowed him to regain his powers made him feel obliged to join the team.

Almost immediately after gathering his other two chosen prospective mutant teammates [[Firestar]] and [[Marvel Boy]] now known as [[Justice]], the four young superheroes became involved in an emergency; the former Herald of [[Galactus]], [[Terrax]], had re-formed his body  and was causing a good deal of destruction in downtown NYC. Arriving at the scene they found another couple of superheroes, [[Namorita]] and [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]]. The six young heroes battled the raging villain and managed to neutralize him via the use of ersatz (but effective) teamwork. In the aftermath, the Avengers showed up and stole the show, leaving some of the young heroes bitter about being slighted, but nevertheless the six agreed to form together into a new team, naming themselves what a reporter had called them â€” the ''New Warriors''.

The Warriors fought crime together fairly successfully for a respectable amount of time, but Dwayne stumbled across some alarming inconsistencies in the sham that was his life. He first discovered that his company was involved in very shady practices, and this initial inconsistency led him inevitably to unravel the lies that he had been fed since childhood. Nothing was as it seemed. In the end, a bizarre mystically-oriented conspiracy was revealed, along with new villains in the form of the [[Folding Circle]], and Tai's true role was made clear.

=====The Folding Circle=====
During this time Dwayne pretended to join the [[Folding Circle]] in order to infiltrate the team, but he neglected to tell the Warriors this. His obsession with justice still fueled by his parents' deaths and his anger issues led to him leaving the team.

In the aftermath of his departure, the Warriors were never quite the same. The lineup changed a bit, and Dwayne was an off-again, on-again ally. He suffered setbacks along the way, including losing his girlfriend and teammate Silhouette to his alleged half-brother [[Bandit (comics)|Bandit]]. Dwayne was also no longer the undisputed leader of the Warriors; most of the group turned first to Namorita and then later to Justice for leadership. He later involved himself with [[Psionex]] but eventually returned to the team in the last issues of the volume.

====''New Warriors'' (vol. 2)====
Sometime between the first and second volume, Night Trasher disbanded the team and decided to travel abroad, training in various martial arts disciplines. Learning of a plot against [[Iron Fist]] by the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] during that time, Night Trasher rejoins the Warriors in order to save Iron Fist's life. After the adventure, he leaves again. In the volume's last issue (#10), he returns to the team, so that they can be molded into an effective superhero team again.

====''New Warriors'' (vol. 3)====
Dwayne Taylor eventually 'retired' from being a hero, but stayed semi-active while running the '''Taylor Foundation'''. He wished to use the foundation to make the world a better place, and became heavily involved in cancer research. He gatherered a top notch staff of microbiologists, one of whom developed what appeared to be a cure for [[cancer]]. The cure for cancer turned out to have actually been the work of the biologist's mutant son, who'd used his powers to 'tell' the cure what to do. This revelation destroyed investor confidence in the Taylor Foundation.  The scientist died trying to prove his cancer cure worked, by testing it on himself.

Dwayne salvaged the remains of the Taylor Foundation, and adopted [[Microbe (comics)|Microbe]] the mutant son of the dead [[microbiologist]]. Dwayne approached a television production company to bankroll and promote a new team, packaging their adventures as a reality TV show. He reassembled a new team of Warriors, plus Microbe, and they travelled the country.

===="Civil War"====
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
Night Thrasher was among the four New Warriors that started the [[Civil War (comics)|Marvel Civil War]]. When [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] exploded, Night Thrasher apparently died in the blast, as was confirmed in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #1.

==Powers and abilities==

According to the villain Genecide, Dwayne has some unspecified "advanced DNA". And in issue #10 [[Emma Frost]] states he was somehow naturally immune to telepathic probes; this was later revealed to have been caused by Tai, either due to her tampering with his memory or a deliberate effort on Tai's part to ensure that no one else could manipulate Dwayne and interfere with her plans for him.

His athletic prowess and fighting ability are ''par excellence''; he has been able to hold his own against the [[Punisher]] (The only thing preventing him from winning was that the Punisher managed to shove his [[submachine gun]] under him and shot several bullets into his armor at close range, breaking his ribs). His strength was further enhanced - though not to a truly super-human degree - by his combat armor.

===Equipment===
Night Thrasher wore a special suit of light articulated combat armor he originally designed to survive physical combat with [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette's]] brother [[Midnight's Fire]]. He also carried a pair of [[Escrima]] sticks which he called his "Battle Staves" which attached to special slots in the back of the '''Mark I''' armor, and an armored high tech skateboard which also hooked onto the back of his armor. The left wrist of his armor contained a thin [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] [[garrote]] wire. The Mark I armor also had a hidden compartment in which he had a Micro [[Uzi]] machine pistol stored for emergencies. His skateboard could be used either as a weapon or as a shield, it contained a wide concealed blade.

The wrist gauntlets on his armor could fire [[pepper spray]], sleeping gas or explosively launch his "Battle Staves" which where holstered alongside his forearms in the '''Mark II''' armor. His gauntlets could also deploy grapnel lines and contained retractable blades. He also had a utility pack with various shaped explosives, smoke capsules, caltrops, and ball bearings. The ''Mark II'' armor also had an advanced [[active camouflage]] system.
