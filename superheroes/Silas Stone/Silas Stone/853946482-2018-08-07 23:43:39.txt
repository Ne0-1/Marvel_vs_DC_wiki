==Fictional character biography==
Silas Stone is a scientist who formerly worked at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and is the father of Victor Stone. Blaming himself for the accident that damaged 90% of his son's body during his high school days, Silas Stone had to turn his son into a cyborg which led to Victor Stone taking the name [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. As Victor blamed his father for the accident, Silas attempted to heal his son's hatred of him by helping to build [[Titans Tower]] for the [[Teen Titans]].<ref>''DC Comics Presents'' #26.

While on his deathbed after years of failing to make it up to his son due to him dying from radiation poisoning caused by a monster the Teen Titans were fighting, Silas finally reconciled with Cyborg as he passes away.<ref>''New Teen Titans'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Silas Stone is a scientist at S.T.A.R. Labs Super-Human Study building in [[Detroit]] studying a [[Mother Box|mysterious box]] when he is informed of the arrival of his son Victor. While Silas was annoyed that Victor showed up at his place of work, Victor talks to him about the scholarships that he received. Silas states that he doesn't need a scholarship as he is already paying for his school which leads to the two of them arguing about it. When the box in the [[Justice League]]'s possession and the box at S.T.A.R. Labs activate, [[Parademon]]s come out and Victor is torn apart.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #2.

With help from some co-workers, Silas takes his son to a secured room while telling him to hang in there. Following Victor's brief cardiac arrest while his body is being outfitted with experimental technology, Silas starts hearing Cyborg quote the binary code indicating that his repaired body is now online.<ref>''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #3.
