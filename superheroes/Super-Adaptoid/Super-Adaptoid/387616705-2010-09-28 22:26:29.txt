The '''Super-Adaptoid''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

The first Super-Adaptoid appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #82 (Oct. 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Gene Colan]].

The character has appeared in over four decades of Marvel continuity and featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated]] [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[trading cards]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Super-Adaptoid debuted in the title ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'', being created by scientific organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. The character is an [[android (robot)|android]] containing a [[sherd|shard]] of the [[Magic item|artifact]] known as the [[Cosmic Cube]], and is programmed to defeat the hero [[Captain America]]. The Adaptoid is unsuccessful,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #82 - 84 (Oct. - Dec. 1966)</ref>  but eventually comes into close proximity to the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and is able to copy the powers of all heroes present. After a brief battle the Adaptoid escapes, believing - incorrectly - that Captain America has been killed.<ref>''Avengers'' #45 (Oct. 1967)</ref>

After an appearance in the title [[X-Men]]<ref>''X-Men'' #29 (Feb. 1967)</ref> the Adaptoid features in the title ''[[Iron Man]]'' and is destroyed.<ref>''Iron Man'' #49 - 50 (Aug. - Sep. 1972)</ref> The Adaptoid reforms in the title ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'', and after a brief battle with Iron Man follows the hero to Avengers Mansion, where the character battles the team and [[Kree]] ally ''Captain Marvel''. Mar-Vell tricks the Adaptoid into copying his ''nega-bands'', which act as a portal to the alternate dimension the [[Negative Zone]]. By striking the Adaptoid's nega-bands together, Mar-Vell banishes the character to the Negative Zone indefinitely.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #50 (Jun. 1977)</ref>

The Adaptoid is retrieved in the title ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' and used unsuccessfully by villains [[Annihilus]] and [[Blastaar]] against the hero the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the Avengers in the Negative Zone.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #75 (May 1981)</ref> The Adaptoid reappears in the title ''Avengers'' and is revealed to be stored at Avengers Mansion, where it is found by the [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Fixer]] when the supervillains the [[Masters of Evil]] storm the Mansion. The Adaptoid escapes, and after placing the Fixer in his containment unit, copies the powers of the villain [[Mentallo]]. Uniting a team of artificial beings called ''Heavy Metal'' (consisting of the [[Awesome Android]]; [[Machine Man]]; the [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry 459]] and [[TESS-One]]), the Adaptoid directs them against the Avengers. While the heroes are distracted, the Adaptoid summons the entity [[Kubik]] - a sentient Cosmic Cube - to Earth, so that the character can copy Kubik's powers and become all-powerful. Although successful, the Adaptoid is tricked into shutting down by Captain America.<ref>''Avengers'' #286 - 290 (Dec. 1987 - Apr. 1988)</ref>

The Adaptoid makes a brief appearance during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' storyline in the title [[Fantastic Four]];<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #336 (Jan. 1990)</ref> the title [[Heroes For Hire|Heroes for Hire]] where the character is disabled,<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7; 10 (Jan. & Apr. 1998)</ref> and the title [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], with scientist Bruce Banner (the [[alter ego]] of the Hulk) being [[blackmail]]ed into repairing and activating the Adaptoid.<ref>''Hulk'' #469 (Oct. 1998)</ref>

In a ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' annual, terrorist organization [[HYDRA]] commission a new Adaptoid from A.I.M and deploy it to battle the ''New Avengers''. A fusion of human ([[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]]) and machine, the Adaptoid is eventually defeated when the powers "copied" from Avenger [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] cause the character the same [[psychological]] problems he experiences. HYDRA then destroys the Adaptoid via a remote-controlled self destruct device.<ref>''New Avengers'' Annual #1 (2006)</ref>

An "Ultra-Adaptoid" appears in the limited series ''Super-Villain Team-Up: Modok's 11''. Created by A.I.M. to infiltrate a group of super-villains formed by [[MODOK]] - a past A.I.M. creation himself - the character has no independent will and is remotely controlled. Courtesy of a [[satellite]] relay, the Adaptoid has access to dozens of powers, but is eventually destroyed when released from A.I.M control.<ref>^''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2008)</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid features in the limited series ''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'', and is revealed to be a warrior in the employ of the [[Extraterrestrial life|Alien]] [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. Claiming it left Earth after becoming disgusted with humanity's chaotic nature, the character attempts to destroy the new [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]], her companion [[Moondragon]] and a reborn [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1 - #4 (Jul. - Oct. 2007)</ref>

===Super-Adaptoid II===
A Super-Adaptoid using the alias of "Alessandro Brannex" provides a new but inferior model of itself to the villainous group the [[New Enforcers]] to use as a field agent. The inferior model, however, is eventually deactivated by crime boss [[Richard Fisk|Blood Rose]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #99-100 (April-May 1993)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Created by A.I.M, the first Super-Adaptoid is an artificial construct capable of copying or mimicking the powers and skills of numerous super beings, including specific equipment and clothing. This ability to adapt was originally courtesy of a shard of the artifact the [[Cosmic Cube]], although the shard was eventually removed by [[cosmic entity]] [[Kubik]]. The character, however, has proven capable of continuing to function without the shard. The Adaptoid possesses exceptional artificial intelligence, but limited imagination and an inability to understand the human condition, which has led to defeat in the past.<ref>''Avengers'' #290 (Apr. 1988)</ref>

==In other media==
* The Super-Adaptoid appears in the [[animated]] [[television series]] ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' (1966) and has two cameo appearances in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'']] TV series (1992).
