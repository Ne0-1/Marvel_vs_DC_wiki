The Super-Adaptoid debuted in the title ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'', being created by scientific organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. The character is an [[android (robot)|android]] containing a [[sherd|shard]] of the [[Magic item|artifact]] known as the [[Cosmic Cube]], and is programmed to defeat the hero [[Captain America]], which it nearly does after infiltrating [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Headquarters and copying the standout fighting abilities and respective traits of Captain America and his fellow Avengers ([[Henry Pym|Goliath]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]). After a long battle between Captain America and the Adaptoid, the Adaptoid flees, believing - incorrectly - that it killed Captain America.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #82 - 84 (Oct. - Dec. 1966)</ref>

The Adaptoid then took refuge underground near the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute For Higher Learning]] and was unintentionally awakened by an optic blast from [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]]. The Adaptoid left his hideout and saw the X-Men in their civilian clothes ice skating. He then recalls that he had another mission: to transform others into Adaptoids like himself, so he begins his attempt with the [[X-Men]]. They refused and a fight broke out. As the battle dragged on, [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]], who had just been asked to leave the X-Men, watched from a distance and saw how powerful the Adaptoid was. The Adaptoid soon defeated the X-Men, and was then approached by Calvin who offered to become an adaptoid. During the process Calvin changed his mind when he learned he would have no free will and the two began to fight. During the battle the Adaptoid tried to copy the powers that Mimic had copied from the X-Men and failed. Calvin then devised a plan and tried to mimic the abilities of the Super Adaptoid causing huge feedback which made both of them lose their powers. As Mimic was rescued by his fellow X-Men the Adaptoid fell to a river below.<ref>''X-Men'' #29 (Feb. 1967)</ref> The Adaptoid later attacks Captain America during a charity event involving the Avengers, after copying Thor and Iron Man, who leave before he reveals himself, and Hercules. He is tricked into using all his powers at once, overloading himself.<ref>''Avengers'' #45</ref> The Adaptoid features in the title ''[[Iron Man]]'' and is destroyed.<ref>''Iron Man'' #49 - 50 (Aug. - Sep. 1972)</ref> The Adaptoid reforms in the title ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'', and after a brief battle with Iron Man follows the hero to Avengers Mansion, where the character battles the team and [[Kree]] ally ''Captain Marvel''. Mar-Vell tricks the Adaptoid into copying his ''nega-bands'', which act as a portal to the alternate dimension the [[Negative Zone]]. By striking the Adaptoid's nega-bands together, Mar-Vell banishes the character to the Negative Zone indefinitely.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #50 (Jun. 1977)</ref>

The Adaptoid is retrieved in the title ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' and used unsuccessfully by villains [[Annihilus]] and [[Blastaar]] against the hero the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the Avengers in the Negative Zone.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #75 (May 1981)</ref> The Adaptoid reappears in the title ''Avengers'' and is revealed to be stored at Avengers Mansion, where it is found by the [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Fixer]] when the supervillains the [[Masters of Evil]] storm the Mansion. The Adaptoid escapes, and after placing the Fixer in his containment unit, copies the powers of the villain [[Mentallo]]. Uniting a team of artificial beings called ''Heavy Metal'' (consisting of the [[Awesome Android]]; [[Machine Man]]; the [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry 459]] and [[TESS-One]]), the Adaptoid directs them against the Avengers. While the heroes are distracted, the Adaptoid summons the entity [[Kubik]] - a sentient Cosmic Cube - to Earth, so that the character can copy Kubik's powers and become all-powerful. Although successful, the Adaptoid is tricked into shutting down by Captain America.<ref>''Avengers'' #286 - 290 (Dec. 1987 - Apr. 1988)</ref>

The Adaptoid makes a brief appearance during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' storyline in the title [[Fantastic Four]];<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #336 (Jan. 1990)</ref> the title [[Heroes for Hire]] where the character is disabled,<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #7; 10 (Jan. & Apr. 1998)</ref> and the title [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], with scientist Bruce Banner (the [[alter ego]] of the Hulk) being [[blackmail]]ed into repairing and activating the Adaptoid.<ref>''Hulk'' #469 (Oct. 1998)</ref>

An "Ultra-Adaptoid" appears in the limited series ''Super-Villain Team-Up: Modok's 11''. Created by A.I.M. to infiltrate a group of super-villains formed by [[MODOK]] - a past A.I.M. creation himself - the character has no independent will and is remotely controlled. Courtesy of a [[satellite]] relay, the Adaptoid has access to dozens of powers, but is eventually destroyed when released from A.I.M control.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2008)</ref>

The Super-Adaptoid features in the limited series ''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'', and is revealed to be a warrior in the employ of the [[Extraterrestrial life|Alien]] [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. Claiming it left Earth after becoming disgusted with humanity's chaotic nature, the character attempts to destroy the new [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]], her companion [[Moondragon]] and a reborn [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1 - #4 (Jul. - Oct. 2007)</ref>

===Super-Adaptoid ("Brannex")===
A Super-Adaptoid using the alias of "Alessandro Brannex" provides a new but inferior model of itself to the villainous group the [[New Enforcers]] to use as a field agent. The inferior model is eventually deactivated by crime boss [[Richard Fisk|Blood Rose]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #99-100 (Aprilâ€“May 1993)</ref>

===People becoming Super-Adaptoid===
The terrorist organization [[HYDRA]] commission a new Adaptoid from A.I.M and deploy it to battle the ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]''. This version is a fusion of human and machine where [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]] managed to copy the powers of [[Iron Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Ms. Marvel]], [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. The Adaptoid is eventually defeated when the powers "copied" from Avenger Sentry cause the character the same [[psychological]] problems he experiences. HYDRA then destroys the Adaptoid via a remote-controlled self-destruct device.<ref>''New Avengers'' Annual #1 (2006)</ref>

[[Norman Osborn]] was given the powers of the Super-Adaptoid by his followers in [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] to replace his lack of the [[Iron Patriot]] armor and his disinclination to return to his old [[Green Goblin]] role, but even after absorbing the powers of his [[Dark Avengers]], [[Luke Cage]], the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Noh-Varr|Protector]], and [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], he was defeated when the Avengers and the New Avengers struck him all at once, the multiple powers working against each other and causing him to collapse into a coma.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 4 #24 (May 2012)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Created by A.I.M, the first Super-Adaptoid is an artificial construct capable of copying or mimicking the powers and skills of numerous super beings, including specific equipment and clothing. This ability to adapt was originally courtesy of a shard of the artifact the [[Cosmic Cube]], although the shard was eventually removed by [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Kubik]]. The character, however, has proven capable of continuing to function without the shard. The Adaptoid possesses exceptional artificial intelligence, but limited imagination and an inability to understand the human condition, which has led to defeat in the past.<ref>''Avengers'' #290 (Apr. 1988)</ref> The powers that Super-Adaptoid had duplicated (and has stored in his templates) include [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] II, [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Captain America]], [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] I, [[Baron Zemo|Citizen V]], [[Doctor Druid]], [[Henry Pym|Goliath]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Human Torch]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[Iron Man]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-I]], [[Machine Man]], [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Red Skull]]'s battle suit, [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]], [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].

The second Super-Adaptoid has the same powers, but the ones he demonstrated are the powers of [[Blitz (Marvel Comics)|Blitz]], [[Richard Fisk|Blood Rose]], [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]], [[Dragon Man]], [[Dreadnought (comics)|Dreadnought]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] II, [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], [[Sunset Bain|Madame Menace]], [[Mentallo]], [[Mister Fear]] IV, [[Plantman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Thermite (comics)|Thermite]] II, [[Tangle (comics)|Tangle]], and [[Vanisher]].

When Yelena Belova was given the power of the Super-Adaptoid, [[Spider-Man]] had the idea to overload her ability to duplicate powers by having [[Iron Man]] attack her with all of his [[Iron Man's armor|armors]] at once, overloaded the Adaptoid's copying ability as she only had the 'space' to copy one Iron Man armor rather than all of them.{{issue|date=April 2011}}

A similar solution was used to defeat Norman Osborn when he was given the powers of the Super-Adaptoid, the combined attack of all of the Avengers and New Avengers members overloading Osborn's system and causing him to become comatose as his body couldn't cope with so many different powers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #23</ref>

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
The Super-Adaptoid appeared in [[Franklin Richards]]' [[Heroes Reborn]] universe as a device used by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. It is defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Since its defeat, it gains [[sentience]], dubbs itself '''Amazo-Maxi-Woman''', and joins the heroes quest to stop [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 #11</ref>
