'''Puck''' is a [[fictional character]], a comic book superhero in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Puck first appeared in ''Alpha Flight #1'' and was created by [[John Byrne]].

==Character biographies==
The first character to use the codename is a man whose real name is '''Eugene Milton Judd'''. He was born in [[1914]] in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. His superhero origin began when he was hired to steal the Black Blade of [[Baghdad]]. The Blade was actually a prison for an ancient sorcerer called Raazer, and Judd accidentally freed him.

Judd was able to trap Raazer once more using some ancient [[mysticism]] and the light from his own life force. However, this caused him to shrink to about 3' in height. It has also granted him immortality. Eventually joining [[Alpha Flight]], he adopted the codename 'Puck' (as in an [[ice hockey]] [[puck (hockey)|puck]]) due to his diminutive size, [[Canada|Canadian]] nationality, and remarkable acrobatic and combat style.

In [[2004]], Marvel began a new Alpha Flight series which featured a ''female'' character named Puck. The series was cancelled due to poor sales before any significant background was established for the new Puck. The character, whose real name was '''Zuzha Yu''', worked at a bar near [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] and was supposedly the daughter of the original Puck.  She agreed to join the reformed Alpha Flight after losing an arm-wrestling match with Walter Langkowski, alias [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]].

==Powers and abilities==
The original Puck had enhanced agility and superhuman strength rivalling that of [[Spider-Man]].  He was also a trained soldier and formidable hand to hand combatant.

The second Puck seems to have inherited some of his powers but to what degree is not clear.  Her strength is at least enhanced beyond a level attainable by normal humans.  She has experience in street fighting techniques.
