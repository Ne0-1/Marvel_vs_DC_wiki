'''Puck''' is the codename of two [[fictional character]]s, a father and daughter pair who are both members of [[Alpha Flight]], in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]

==Eugene Judd==
'''Puck''' (real name '''Eugene Milton Judd''') is a [[fictional character]], a comic book superhero in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Puck first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' #1 and was created by [[John Byrne]].

===Character biography===
The first character to use the codename is a man whose real name is '''Eugene Milton Judd'''. He was born in [[1914]] in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. His superhero origin began when he was hired to steal the Black Blade of [[Baghdad]]. The Blade was actually a prison for an ancient sorcerer called [[Black Raazer]], and Judd accidentally freed him.

Judd was able to trap Raazer once more using some ancient [[mysticism]] and the light from his own life force. However, this caused him to shrink to about 3' in height. It has also granted him immortality.  At some point, he became friends with the American playboy Dan Kane, otherwise known as Captain Terror.  When Captain Terror was defeated in the [[Spanish Civil War]] by the 1930s [[El Aguila]], a fellow hero fighting on the opposite side, he retired, but Puck fought El Aguila for revenge.  [http://www.comicboards.com/invaders/view.php?trd=060622182003] Eventually joining [[Alpha Flight]], he adopted the codename 'Puck.'

{{spoiler}}
Along with [[Major Mapleleaf]], Puck II, Vindicator, [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], and [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Puck was among the Alpha Flight members to be seemingly killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]] in ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #16.

===Powers and abilities===
The original Puck had enhanced agility and superhuman strength rivaling that of [[Spider-Man]]. He was also a trained soldier and formidable hand-to-hand combatant. After a run-in with The Master of the World his body was altered and compressed, resulting in his tissue becoming akin to compressed rubber.

His aging is hugely retarded; Judd resembles a man in his thirties.

In [[2004]], Marvel began a new Alpha Flight series which featured a ''female'' character named Puck. The series was cancelled due to poor sales before any significant background was established for the new Puck. The character, whose real name was '''Zuzha Yu''', [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], worked at a bar near [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] and was supposedly the daughter of the original Puck.  She agreed to join the reformed Alpha Flight after losing an arm-wrestling match with Walter Langkowski, alias [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]].

Zuzha named herself '''Puck''' after the character in William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Nights Dream' with the same name.

She was one of the members of Alpha Flight injured by [[Xorn|The Collective]], as well.

===Powers and abilities===
Zuzha has superhuman strength, speed, agility and can redirect kinetic energy.

She is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant.

==Trivia==
*Creator John Byrne had originally intended for the original Puck to be a [[dwarfism|dwarf]]; subsequent writer [[Bill Mantlo]] would later retcon that Puck's small stature was due to mystical influences. Byrne commented on this, stating, "Of course, [Mantlo] then went on to do the 'origin' of Puck, with the whole 'demon inside' thing being based, apparently, on the single reference Puck had made to being in constant pain, something which Bill failed to grasp was an effect of the condition -- [[achondroplasty]], called by name in the same issue that referenced the pain -- which caused Puck's dwarfism."

*While Zuzha was named after the Shakespearian character, John Byrne has stated that Judd was named after a [[hockey puck]].[http://byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#203]"
