'''Puck''' ('''Eugene Milton Judd''') is a [[fictional character]], a comic book superhero in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Puck first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 1 #1 and was created by [[John Byrne]].

===Fictional character biography===
The first character to use the codename is a man whose real name is '''Eugene Milton Judd'''. He was born in 1914 in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. He spent years traveling the world as a soldier of fortune, working as an intelligent agent and bouncer, before becoming a professional adventurer and joining Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>

Early in his career, Puck was wounded by teammate [[Marrina Smallwood|Marinna]] and hospitalized.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #2</ref> He battled an illegal drug running that was operating out of the hospital.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #5</ref> Before long, he returned to active duty, and battled [[Omega Flight]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #12</ref> Puck comforted [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]] after [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]]'s presumed death.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #13-14</ref> Puck then encountered the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]],<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #15</ref> and allied with the Sub-Mariner in battle against the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #16</ref>

Puck later journeyed to the realm of the [[Great Beasts]] alongside Alpha Flight, where they battled the Great Beasts.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #24</ref> Puck encountered the [[Beyonder]],<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28</ref> and battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] during the events of ''[[Secret Wars II]]''.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #29</ref>

During his time with Alpha Flight, he encountered a new city deep in the Arctic Circle. There his team and the X-Men discovered a mystical wellspring. Several humans associated with the X-Men gained vast powers via the wellspring. Puck was cured of his dwarfism and now had trouble walking because his [[center of balance]] was off. Later, he learned that the powers came at a price too high to bear, such as the loss of all creativity among all affected and the deaths of all mystics, which included Puck's friend Shaman. The trickster god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] was behind all this and eventually was persuaded to remove all effects of the well, which unfortunately included Puck's new height. A thought balloon indicated that the pain associated with his dwarfism was now worse than ever.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' #1-2 (December 1985 & January 1986)</ref>

Soon after, Puck's [[#Origin|background]] was revealed, and he battled Razer.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #32</ref> He then began a romance with Heather Hudson.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #33</ref> Puck later encountered the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #39</ref>

Razer was later freed from Puck's body, returning Puck to normal size. Puck was teleported to Tibet by Loki, and decided to abandon his previous life.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #50</ref> Puck became embroiled in a battle between Tibet and mainland China. He battled the Dragon, and battled [[Dreamqueen]] alongside Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #59-60</ref> Puck eventually received superhuman powers again, and became a dwarf once more; he rejoined Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #87-90</ref>

Later, during the events of the [[Infinity War]], Puck was brainwashed and taken by the cosmic powered villain the Goddess. He was paired up with the affected [[Spider-Man]] when an invasion force of superheroes planned to attack the Goddess' fortress. This specific pairing was to teach Spider-Man brutality in the face of his 'former' friends. Puck is swiftly taken out of the fight, defeated by Firestar. Due to the effects of the resulting clash, all brainwashed heroes were later freed.{{issue}}

Puck would be brainwashed again by members of his own government, who desired to have an Alpha Flight completely under their control.{{issue}}

Along with [[Major Mapleleaf]], Puck II, Vindicator, and [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Puck was among the Alpha Flight members to be killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]].<ref>''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> Only [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] was confirmed to survive.{{issue}}

===Powers and abilities===
The original Puck had enhanced agility and superhuman strength rivaling that of [[Spider-Man]]. He also has superhuman speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes. He was also a trained soldier and formidable hand-to-hand combatant, capable of a mixture of various martial arts, street-fighting techniques, acrobatics and gymnastics. His trademark attack is a cartwheeling motion. Spinning on his hands and feet at great speeds, he is able to slam into and knock down human-sized enemies with ease. Judd is skilled in bullfighting, and has some knowledge of magic, and the ability to put himself in a temporary death-like trance state.

After a run-in with The Master of the World his body was subject to genetic manipulation of his cellular structure. His body tissues were condensed at a molecular level, causing his body to become akin to compressed rubber. Also, his aging is vastly slowed; Judd resembles a man in his thirties. Puck is a dwarf; his right ear is misshapen, presumably due to an old injury.

===Origin===
Judd's superhero origin began when he was hired to steal the Black Blade of [[Baghdad]]. The Blade was actually a prison for an ancient sorcerer called [[Black Raazer]], and Judd accidentally freed him.

Judd was able to trap Raazer once more using some ancient [[mysticism]] and the light from his own life force. However, this caused the 7' tall adventurer to shrink to about 3' 6" in height. This was because the Black Blade had the ability to take life force from others, which caused a physical reduction in size. It has also granted him immortality.  At some point, he became friends with the American playboy Dan Kane, otherwise known as Captain Terror. When Captain Terror was defeated in the [[Spanish Civil War]] by the 1930s [[El Aguila]], a fellow hero fighting on the opposite side, he retired, but Puck fought El Aguila for revenge.<ref>http://www.comicboards.com/invaders/view.php?trd=060622182003</ref> He also formed a friendship with noted author [[Ernest Hemmingway]] and became an accomplished bullfighter. Eventually joining [[Alpha Flight]], he adopted the codename 'Puck.'

===Intended origin===
Creator John Byrne had originally intended for the original Puck to be a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] with no superhuman powers, merely great fighting and acrobatic skills; subsequent writer [[Bill Mantlo]] would later retcon that Puck's small stature was due to mystical influences. Byrne commented on this, stating, "Of course, [Mantlo] then went on to do the 'origin' of Puck, with the whole 'demon inside' thing being based, apparently, on the single reference Puck had made to being in constant pain, something which Bill failed to grasp was an effect of the condition — [[achondroplasty]], called by name in the same issue that referenced the pain — which caused Puck's dwarfism."<ref>http://byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#140</ref>

Byrne has also stated that Puck was based "very, very loosely on a friend who was short (but not as short as Puck) and occasionally bald."<ref>http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17960&PN=2&TPN=1</ref>

==Other versions==
===[[Earth X]]===
In this alternate future, Puck is seen as one of the many heroes in the afterlife. They all rally to fight the forces of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Thanos]], in an attempt to stop their genocidal plans.{{issue}}

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] comics set in the universe of Earth-2149 the zombified [[Alpha Flight]] attack the X-men and are eventually killed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Puck is pictured in the foreground of a large panel depicting Alpha Flight attacking the X-Men and Puck is apparently attacking [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].  Puck is destroyed moments later by Magneto.{{issue}}

In 2004, Marvel began a new Alpha Flight series which featured a female character named Puck. The series was cancelled due to poor sales before any significant background was established for the new Puck. The character, whose real name was '''Zuzha Yu''', was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who worked at a bar near [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] and was supposedly the daughter of the original Puck{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  She agreed to join the reformed Alpha Flight after losing an arm-wrestling match with Walter Langkowski, alias [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]].

Zuzha named herself '''Puck''' after the character in William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Nights Dream' with the same name.

She was one of the members of Alpha Flight killed by [[Xorn|The Collective]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #16; confirmed in ''New Avengers'' #20</ref>
