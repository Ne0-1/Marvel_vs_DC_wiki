'''Puck''' ('''Eugene Milton Judd''') is a [[fictional character]], a comic book superhero in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Puck first appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 1 #1 and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

===Fictional origin===
Judd's superhero origin began when he was hired to steal the Black Blade of [[Baghdad]]. The Blade was actually a prison for an ancient sorcerer called [[Black Raazer]], and Judd accidentally freed him.

Judd was able to trap Raazer once more using some ancient [[mysticism]] and the light from his own life force. However, this caused the 7' tall adventurer to shrink to about 3' 6" in height. This was because the Black Blade had the ability to take life force from others, which caused a physical reduction in size. It has also granted him immortality.  At some point, he became friends with the American playboy Dan Kane, otherwise known as Captain Terror. When Captain Terror was defeated in the [[Spanish Civil War]] by the 1930s [[El Aguila]], a fellow hero fighting on the opposite side, he retired, but Puck fought El Aguila for revenge.<ref>http://www.comicboards.com/invaders/view.php?trd=060622182003</ref> He also formed a friendship with noted author [[Ernest Hemingway]] and became an accomplished bullfighter. Eventually joining [[Alpha Flight]], he adopted the codename 'Puck.'

===Fictional character biography===
The first character to use the codename is a man whose real name is '''Eugene Milton Judd'''. He was born in 1914 in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. He spent years traveling the world as a soldier of fortune, working as an intelligence agent and bouncer, before becoming a professional adventurer and joining Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>

Early in his career, Puck locates the Black Blade of Baghdad, which releases the entraped evil sorcerer [[Black Raazer]].  To recapture Raazer, Puck uses his own body, which causes him to be reduced to half his size and to endure ongoing pain.

Puck was wounded by teammate [[Marrina Smallwood|Marinna]] and hospitalized.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #2</ref> He battled an illegal drug running that was operating out of the hospital.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #5</ref> Before long, he returned to active duty, and battled [[Omega Flight]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #12</ref> Puck comforted [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]] after [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]]'s presumed death.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #13-14</ref> Puck then encountered the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]],<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #15</ref> and allied with the Sub-Mariner in battle against the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #16</ref>

Puck later journeyed to the realm of the [[Great Beasts]] alongside Alpha Flight, where they battled the Great Beasts.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #24</ref> Puck encountered the [[Beyonder]],<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28</ref> and battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] during the events of ''[[Secret Wars II]]''.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #29</ref>

During his time with Alpha Flight, he encounters a new city deep in the Arctic Circle. There his team and the X-Men discover a mystical wellspring. Several humans associated with the X-Men had gained vast powers via the wellspring. Puck was cured of his dwarfism by the well-intentioned [[Madeline Pryor]]. He discovers a problem with walking because his [[center of balance]] was off. Later, the group discovered that the powers came at a price too high to bear, such as the loss of all creativity among all affected and the deaths of all mystics. This includes Puck's friend Shaman. The group splits along ideological lines and both groups battle for some time before turning on the main threat. This turns out to be the trickster god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] was behind all this. He is eventually persuaded to remove all effects of the well, which unfortunately includes Puck's new height. A thought balloon indicates that the pain associated with his dwarfism was now worse than ever.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' #1-2 (December 1985 & January 1986)</ref>

Soon after, Puck's [[#Origin|background]] is revealed, and he battles [[Black Raazer]] who has freed himself from the prison of Puck's body.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #32</ref> 

He then began a romance with Heather Hudson.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #33</ref> Puck later encounters the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #39</ref>

Razer is later freed from Puck's body, returning Puck to normal size and actual age. Puck is teleported to Tibet by Loki, and decides to abandon his previous life.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #50</ref> Puck became embroiled in a battle between Tibet and mainland China. He battles the Dragon, and fights [[Dreamqueen]] alongside Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #59-60</ref> Puck eventually receives superhuman powers again, and became a dwarf once more; he rejoins Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #87-90</ref>

Later, during the events of the [[Infinity War]], Puck is brainwashed and taken by the cosmic powered villain the Goddess. He is paired up with the affected [[Spider-Man]] when an invasion force of free-minded superheroes plan to attack the Goddess' fortress. This specific pairing is intended to teach Spider-Man brutality in the face of his 'former' friends. Puck is swiftly taken out of the fight, defeated by Firestar. Due to the effects of the resulting clash, all brainwashed heroes are later freed.<ref>"Infinity War" #6</ref>

Puck is brainwashed again by members of his own government, who desired to have an Alpha Flight completely under their control.<ref>"Alpha Flight #1" Vol. 2</ref> Puck fights with this new team for a while and is one of the few to relatively succeed against the mental mind games. 

Along with [[Major Mapleleaf]], Puck II, Vindicator, and [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], Puck is among the Alpha Flight members to be apparently killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]].<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> Only [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] was confirmed to survive.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

When [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] has been trapped in Hell by unknown forces, Puck and an unknown person are seen there, with the unknown person claiming to just want to talk to Wolverine, but Puck planning on finding a way to get both Wolverine and himself out of hell.<ref>''Wolverine'' v4 #2</ref> Puck tells Wolverine to fight through the pain he feels while being tortured, implying that it will make the devil look weak and cause an uprising in hell, thus giving them a chance to escape.<ref>''Wolverine'' v4 #3</ref> After the Devil is beaten, Puck attempts to escape along with Wolverine, but falls from the walls of hell which he was scaling when another condemned one grabs his foot and yanks him off and back into the pit. Though he remains in Hell, he wins the scrum for the Devil's sword, thus making him the ruler of Hell, at least for the time being.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #4</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Puck was shown to have escaped from Hell when he arrives to rescue Guardian from Vindicator (who betrayed the team to Gary Cody and his newly-elected Unity Party, later revealed to be under the control of the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]]).<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 4 #2-4</ref>

===Originally intended origin===
Creator John Byrne had originally intended for the original Puck to be a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] with no superhuman powers, merely great fighting and acrobatic skills; subsequent writer [[Bill Mantlo]] would later retcon that Puck's small stature was due to mystical influences. Byrne commented on this, stating, "Of course, [Mantlo] then went on to do the 'origin' of Puck, with the whole 'demon inside' thing being based, apparently, on the single reference Puck had made to being in constant pain, something which Bill failed to grasp was an effect of the condition — [[achondroplasty]], called by name in the same issue that referenced the pain — which caused Puck's dwarfism."<ref>http://byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#140</ref>

Byrne has also stated that Puck was based "very, very loosely on a friend who was short (but not as short as Puck) and occasionally bald, but never possessed by demons."<ref>http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17960&PN=2&TPN=1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Puck had no superhuman powers, relying on his exceptional training. He was a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, capable of a mixture of various martial arts, street-fighting techniques, acrobatics and gymnastics. After a run-in with The Master of the World his body was subject to genetic manipulation of his cellular structure. His body tissues were condensed at a molecular level, causing his body to become akin to compressed rubber. 

His trademark attack is a cartwheeling motion. Spinning on his hands and feet at great speeds, he is able to slam into and knock down human-sized enemies with ease. He is also skilled in bullfighting.

He has some knowledge of mysticism, enough to once trap [[Black Raazer]], and the ability to put himself in a temporary death-like trance state.

Puck is about half the size of the average man. His condition causes him varying amounts of constant pain.

Also, his aging has been stopped or vastly slowed; Judd resembles a man in his thirties.

His right ear is misshapen, presumably due to an old injury.  It resembles the cauliflower ear condition.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In this alternate future, Puck is seen as one of the many heroes in the afterlife. They all rally to fight the forces of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Thanos]], in an attempt to stop their genocidal plans.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies===

Puck is pictured in the foreground of a large panel depicting Alpha Flight attacking the X-Men and Puck is apparently attacking [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].

In 2004, Marvel began a new Alpha Flight series which featured a female character named Puck. The series was cancelled due to poor sales before any significant background was established for the new Puck. The character, whose real name was '''Zuzha Yu''', was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who worked at a bar near [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] and was supposedly the daughter of the original Puck{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.  She agreed to join the reformed Alpha Flight after losing an arm-wrestling match with Walter Langkowski, alias [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]].

She was one of the members of Alpha Flight apparently killed by [[Xorn|The Collective]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #16; confirmed in ''New Avengers'' #20</ref>
