'''Eugene Milton Judd''', a [[fictional character]], was born around the turn of the century in [[Toronto]].  His heroic origin began when he was hired to steal the Black Blade of [[Baghdad]]. The Blade was actually a prison for an ancient sorcerer called Raazer, and Judd accidentally freed him.

He was able to trap Raazer once more using some ancient [[mysticism]] and the light from his own life force. However, this caused him to shrink to about 3' in height. It has also granted him immortality. Eventually joining [[Alpha Flight]], he adopted the codename 'Puck' (as in a [[hockey]] puck) due to his diminutive size, [[Canada|Canadian]] nationality, and remarkable acrobatic and combat skills.
