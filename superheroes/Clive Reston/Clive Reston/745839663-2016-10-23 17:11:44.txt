==Publication history==
Clive Reston first appeared in Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu issue three, in 1974, created by [[Doug Moench]]. He went on to be a recurring character in the ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' series, as well as occasionally appearing in other series such as ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' and ''[[List of X-Men comics|X-Men]]''. He also recently appeared in the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] series ''[[Wisdom (comics)|Wisdom]]'', centered on the character [[Pete Wisdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/character_chron.php?ID=12032 |title=Clive Reston |publisher=Comic Book DB |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> Originally, Reston's father was intended to be [[James Bond]], and his granduncle was intended to be [[Sherlock Holmes]], however due to copyright laws [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] was forced to abandon this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=12032 |title=Clive Reston |publisher=Comic Book DB |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> Now, of course,it is widely known that Shang-Chi was basically Sax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu novels fused together with [[Bruce Lee]] movies, but there is much of the concept had been stolen specifically from ''Enter the Dragon''. Bruce Lee’s character in the movie practically is Shang-Chi. And his uneasy alliance with wisecracking pal Roper [[John Saxon]] echoes, in many ways, Shang-Chi’s give-and-take with agent Clive Reston. Saxon's image was replaced with that of [[Sean Connery]]<ref>http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/02/08/exploitation-friday/</ref>

The pair were subsequently arrested in [[Hong Kong]], after they were framed for committing an explosion at a place called the Jade Peacock. They discovered that they had been set up and that the policemen were criminals in disguise. After escaping from custody, they contacted Mi-6, who helped them locate the secret base of the villain, Kogar, where they engaged in a fight with Kogar's men, before they engaged in a fight with and defeated Kogar.
