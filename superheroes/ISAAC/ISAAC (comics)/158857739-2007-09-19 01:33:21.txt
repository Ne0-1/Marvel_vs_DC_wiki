'''ISAAC''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

ISAAC is an English version of an acronym in the language of the [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]] of [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]] standing for: Integral Synaptic Anti-/Anionic Computer.

ISAAC is a complex computer system which fills almost the entire interior of Titan.  ISAAC controls Titan's artificial environment and all mechanical operations on Titan.  ISAAC can create semi-humanoid androids through which it can speak and act.  For a time, [[Thanos]] had reprogrammed ISAAC to menace the Eternals of Titan, but the computer was restored to its original benevolent programming.
