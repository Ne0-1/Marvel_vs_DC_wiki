'''Bela''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''The Brotherhood #4''.

==Ficitional character history==
At some point the mutant named Bela became a member of the militant mutant terrorist group, [[Brotherhood of Mutants|The Brotherhood]]. 

Bela was one of the members of the Brotherhood's London Cell who were sent to recruit/kidnap the rich mutant [[Malon Reeves]]. The group easily did away with her bodyguards, but Malon escaped. Fellow Brotherhood member [[Clive (comics)|Clive]] was sent after her, but was hit by her car. Instead of having his teammate die a slow death, Bela drained him. The remaining group tracked Malon to a nightclub she frequented and killed a lot more people. While trying to drag Malon off, she used her powers to burn his left hand, before Bryson knocked her out. 

Back at their headquarters, Bela had a little fun by torturing Malon, before [[Bryson Bale]] stepped in to stop him. Bela was sent back to the Reeves Estate, where he came into contact with [[Marshal (comics)|Marshal]]'s fist. Marshal was in charge of the "interrogation" of Bela and Fiona, who was also caught, and forced him to walk a conveyor belt while being stabbed by sharpened pencils. 

Somewhere in London, Bela was sitting in a dark room, tied to a chair. Marshal mentioned that he was now missing two hands. Bela begged him to tell him what he wants, which Marshal replied to with [[X (comics)|X]].

==Powers==
Bela is a psionic vampire who drains a victim's body of its moisture through skin contact. He was apparently also able to levitate or fly to some extent.
