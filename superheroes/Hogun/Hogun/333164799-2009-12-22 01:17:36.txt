==Fictional character biography==
Hogun is a member of a trio of Asgardian adventurers consisting of [[Fandral]] the Dashing, Hogun the Grim, and [[Volstagg]] the Valiant and referred as the [[Warriors Three]] (but not in the comics themselves). They were members of the supporting cast in Marvel's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comics and usually provided comic relief and side-adventures.

The only thing known about his past is that he's not an Aesir like most of the Asgardians.  Also, his unnamed homeland was conquered long ago by [[Mogul of the Mystic Mountain]], who slew Hogun's forebears and laid waste to the land.<ref>as revealed in ''Thor'' #137</ref>

He is primarily characterized by his brusque, taciturn, and often short-tempered demeanor. He is the brooding pessimist of the group, as opposed to [[Volstagg]]'s irrepressible good humor and [[Fandral]]'s brash heroism. He is a fierce and unrelenting warrior, a collector of weaponry and often the voice of reason for the Warriors Three.

Hogun has been involved in a great many adventures and quests, as a member of the Warriors Three, as an ally of Thor, and on his own.

In 2005 a mini-series was published centering around Thor and his allies in the Warriors Three, called ''Thor: Blood Oath''. In it Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace. Hogun heroically endures the assaults of the Egyptian god, Thoth, to shout three names at Thoth's temple to fulfill their quest. He was also the only member of the group able to dominate the bloodthirsty spirit of Chulain's spear, and prevent a murderous rampage. Although the group fails in their quest, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end.

Hogun dies in [[Ragnar√∂k]] fairly early. Later, however, he is found alive and well and was restored by Thor.

==Powers and abilities==
Hogun possesses the conventional superhuman abilities of an Asgardian male.

Hogun is superhumanly strong, his strength being somewhat greater than that of the average Asgardian. Hogun is also extremely long lived, though not immortal, and ages at a pace much slower than humans. The tissues of his body are also more resilient than those of a human, rendering him much more resistant to physical injury. If he is injured, his body is able to heal itself with superhuman speed and efficiency. Hogun's superior musculature and metabolism grants him superhuman levels of stamina. Like all Asgardians, Hogun's bone, skin and muscle are much denser than that of a human, which helps to contribute to his superhuman strength and durability.

Hogun is an excellent overall battlefield warrior, a superb hand-to-hand combatant and horseman. He is highly proficient in the use of all Asgardian weapons, and is a master of bludgeoning weapons, especially the mace. He is also sometimes armed with a sword. He has also demonstrated skill in the area of battlefield medicine and healing arts, though he makes no claim of being a healer of any real proficiency. He has also used the Elixir of Recovery, an Asgardian medical potion.
