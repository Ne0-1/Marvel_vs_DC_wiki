'''Hogun the Grim''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. He is a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]]; a trio of Asgardian adventurers consisting of [[Fandral]] the Dashing, Hogun the Grim, and [[Volstagg]] the Voluminous. They were members of the supporting cast in Marvel's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comics and usually provided comic relief and side-adventures.

He is primarily characterized by his brusque, taciturn, and often short-tempered demeanor; and he is often referred to as "Hogun the Grim." He is the brooding pessimist of the group, as opposed to [[Volstagg]]'s irrepresible good humor and [[Fandral]]'s brash heroism. In the recent "Blood Oath" mini-series, Hogun heroically endures the assaults of the Egyptian god, Thoth to shout three names at Thoth's temple to fufill their quest. He was also the only member of the group able to dominate the bloodthirsty spirit of Chulain's spear, and prevent a murderous rampage. He is a fiere and unrelenting warrior, and often the voice of reason for the Warriors Three.

In 2005 a mini-series was published centering around Thor and his allies in the Warriors Three, called Thor: Blood Oath. In it Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace. Although they fail in their quest, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end.

==Powers and abilities==
Hogun is an excellent overall battlefield warrior. He is highly proficient in the use of all Asgardian weapons, and is a master of bludgeoning weapons, especially the mace. Like all Asgardians, Hogun's bone, skin and muscle are roughly 3 times denser than a typical human, giving him superhuman strength and an extremely high resistance to injury. He has also demonstrated skill in the area of battlefield medicine and healing arts, though he makes no claim of being a healer of any real proficiency.
