'''Marlo Chandler''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. Created by [[writer]] [[Peter David]], she first appeared in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #347 (September 1988), and became an ongoing supporting character, first in that book, and later in the ''Captain Marvel'' series published between 1999-2004. 

Marlo first appeared as a [[Las Vegas]] [[aerobics]] instructor and love interest for the casino security enforcer "Mr. Fixit", who was in reality the Hulk, believed dead, and now living incognito, his true identity unknown to Marlo. She ended their relationship after seeing him brutally kill an enemy. They later reconciled after Hulk reached out to her in a rare display of emotion and their relationship was able to end in a more amicable way.

She later appeared as the girlfriend of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], the Hulk's perennial sidekick, and best friend to his alter ego, Bruce Banner.  She met Rick while he was on a book tour promoting his memoir, ''Sidekick''. It was only when Rick, not knowing of Marlo's previous relationship with the Hulk, introduced her to Bruce and his wife [[Betty Banner|Betty]], that Marlo discovered that Mr. Fixit was really the Hulk, and that Bruce was not merely his friend, but his alter ego.

Shortly after this introduction, the psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]] managed to integrate the various personalities of the Hulk, resulting in a being that now possessed a permanent Hulk body with Bruce's face.  When Betty expressed skepticism of a continued relationship with this new version of her husband, she moved in with Marlo, with whom she became best friends.  

Marlo was stabbed to death by Jackie Shorr, Rick's deranged biological mother who had abandoned him at a young age.  Rick eventually employed the technology of the Hulk villain known as [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], who managed to revive Marlo.  

Rick and Marlo eventually married and even became famous while hosting a successful [[talk show]] called ''Keeping up with the Joneses''. During this time they would drift in and out of the Hulk series, making numerous appearances.  During this time Marlo and [[Betty Banner]] (wife of Bruce Banner) became close friends and even lived together for awhile until Betty's untimely death.

Marlo and Rick separated for a time, and she occupied herself with running the couple's [[Los Angeles]]-area comic book store. She and Rick reunited shortly after he was bonded with [[Genis-Vell]] the son of the original Captain Marvel, who took on that mantle himself.

Marlo played a major role in the ''Captain Marvel'' series.  At one point she developed an attraction for the superheroine [[Moondragon]], and Rick left her. The couple later reunited after Marlo realized that whatever feelings she had, they were stronger towards Rick.

As the ''Captain Marvel'' series ended, Rick, now separated from Captain Marvel, and Marlo were last seen happily in love and giving their marriage another shot.
