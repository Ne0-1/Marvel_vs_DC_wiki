'''Marlo Chandler''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She first appeared as a supporting character in the [[Incredible Hulk]] around issue 350, and later appeared in the Captain Marvel series published between 1999-2004. Created by [[Peter David]].

During that time she briefly dated "Mr. Fix-it" (Gray Hulk under an assumed name while working as a Las Vegas strongman). Their relationship was broken off after she saw him brutally kill an enemy. They later reconciled after Hulk reached out to her in a rare display of emotion and their relationship was able to end in a more amicable way.

She later appeared in the Hulk series as the girlfriend of [[Rick Jones]]. She met Rick while he was on a book tour promoting his memoirs. During this time she never connected the Gray-skinned Mr. Fix-it and his "friend" Bruce with the Green-skinned Hulk and his alter-ego Bruce Banner.

Rick and Marlo eventually married and even became famous while hosting a successful [[Talk Show]] called "Keeping up with the Joneses." During this time they would drift in and out of the Hulk series, making numerous appearances.

During this time Marlo and [[Betty Banner]] (wife of Bruce Banner) became close friends and even lived together for awhile until Betty's untimely death.

Marlo and Rick seperated for a time, and she occupied herself with running the couple's Los Angelo-area comic book store. She and Rick reunited shortly after he was bonded with [[Genis-vel]] the son of the original Captain Marvel.

Marlo played a major role in the Captain Marvel series until she developed feelings for the superheroine [[Moondragon]] and Rick left her. The couple later reunited after Marlo realized that whatever feelings she had, they were stronger towards Rick.

As the Captain Marvel series ended, Rick-now separated from Captain Marvel-and Marlo were last seen happily in love and giving their marriage another shot.
