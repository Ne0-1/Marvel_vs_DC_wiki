'''Marlo Chandler''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Peter David]], she first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #347 (September 1988), and became an ongoing supporting character, first in that book, and later in the ''Captain Marvel'' series published between 1999â€“2004. She is the wife of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], a perennial sidekick to the Incredible [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and was a best friend to [[Betty Ross]], the wife of Hulk's alter ego Bruce Banner.

In keeping with her introduction during a storyline in which the Hulk was involved with organized crime, Marlo's name combines the surnames of fictional detective [[Philip Marlowe]] (e.g. ''Marlo'') and his creator [[Raymond Chandler]].

==Fictional character biography==
Marlo first appeared as an [[aerobics]] and [[human swimming|swimming]] instructor and was a love interest for the [[casino security]] enforcer "Joe Fixit", in reality the Hulk, believed dead, and now living ''incognito'', his true identity unknown to Marlo.{{issue|date=September 2011}} She ended their relationship after seeing him brutally kill an enemy.{{issue|date=September 2011}} They later reconciled after Hulk reached out to her in a rare display of emotion and their relationship was able to end in a more amicable way.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

She later appeared as the girlfriend of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], the Hulk's sidekick, and best friend to his alter ego, Bruce Banner.{{issue|date=September 2011}} She met Rick while he was on a book tour promoting his memoir, ''Sidekick''. It was only when Rick, not knowing of Marlo's previous relationship with the Hulk, introduced her to Bruce and his wife [[Betty Banner|Betty]], that Marlo discovered that Mr. Fixit was really the Hulk, and that Bruce was not merely his friend, but his alter ego.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

Shortly after this introduction - Marlo assuring Betty that she had nothing to be jealous about as Bruce and Joe were two distinct people and Bruce had been unswervingly loyal to Betty - the psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]] managed to integrate the various personalities of the Hulk, resulting in a being that now possessed a permanent Hulk body with Bruce's face and intelligence. When Betty expressed skepticism of a continued relationship with this new version of her husband, she moved in with Marlo, with whom she became best friends.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

Marlo was stabbed to death by Jackie Shorr, a deranged woman who claimed to be Rick's biological mother who had abandoned him at a young age.{{issue|date=September 2011}}  Rick eventually employed the technology of the Hulk villain known as [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], who managed to revive Marlo. She did not come back all the way at first; she spent some time in a near vegetative state.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

Rick and Marlo eventually married, although the wedding was nearly called off. At his [[bachelor party]], Rick discovered a [[soft porn]] film that featured Marlo stripping [[nudity|nude]] at the [[beach]], one of several such films she appeared in, just after she had finished high school.{{issue|date=September 2011}} The couple quickly reconciled, thanks to the Hulk's intervention, and they went on with the marriage. Every supervillain from [[Kree]] to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] appeared at her wedding, due to the machinations of the [[Impossible Man]].{{issue|date=September 2011}} The two even became famous while hosting a successful [[talk show]] called ''Keeping up with the Joneses''. During this time they would drift in and out of the Hulk series, making numerous appearances. During this time Marlo and [[Betty Banner]] (wife of Bruce Banner) became close friends and even lived together for a while until Betty's untimely death.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

Marlo and Rick separated for a time, and she occupied herself with running the couple's [[Los Angeles]]-area comic book store.{{issue|date=September 2011}} She and Rick reunited shortly after he was bonded with [[Genis-Vell]] the son of the original Captain Marvel, who took on that mantle himself.{{issue|date=September 2011}} Soon after, Marlo was menaced by the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], a cannibalistic monster. She was saved by the Hulk.{{issue|date=September 2011}}  During the Captain Marvel series, Marlo became possessed by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|the personification of Death]]. The large amount of cosmic powers leave her with a literal death wish, which manifests itself as reality changing to suit Marlo's desires.{{issue|date=September 2011}} Later, after coming to understand the situation, this talent goes away when she wishes for it to be gone.{{issue|date=September 2011}}  The comic store itself often had stories featuring real-life incidents happening to Marlo and Rick. Marlo spent much of the time annoyed by a chain-smoking, female ghost only she could see and hear.{{issue|date=September 2011}} This was the spirit of the girl killed during the Wendigo debacle. Marlo played a major role in the ''Captain Marvel'' series. 

At one point she develops an attraction for the superheroine [[Moondragon]] which surprises the pair. At first both were unsure of what to do and before they could explore the possibility Marlo is whisked away by her husband.{{issue|date=September 2011}}  When the truth eventually comes out Rick stands aside to let Marlo and Heather figure out what may be.  After some time passes Marlo and Heather break up when Marlo realized that whatever feelings she had, they were stronger towards Rick. Heather, brokenheartedly, states she must have subconsciously used her telepathy to enamor Marlo.  This is not true, just Heather trying to make the split easier for Marlo.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

As the ''Captain Marvel'' series ended, Rick, now separated from Captain Marvel, and Marlo were last seen happily in love and giving their marriage a second chance.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

Marlo went missing for some time and was revealed to have been kidnapped by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. She was turned into a new version of the [[Harpy (comics)|Harpy]] by the Leader. After telepathically manipulating her, the Leader sent her to battle Bruce Banner and [[Skaar]]. Afterwards, when she recognized Rick she returned to normal and reunited with Rick (now called A-Bomb).<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #604</ref>

During the ''[[World War Hulks]]'' storyline, she as Harpy helps A-Bomb fight [[Ulik]] after averting a disaster on the train tracks he destroyed. When Ulik starts to choke Marlo, she is saved by A-Bomb who defeats Ulik.<ref>''World War Hulks'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, [[Doctor Strange]] reveals to the Hulk and his allies that Marlo is now a crucial factor in the war. Due to her time as a host of a fragment of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], Marlo could serve as a "Death substitute" if she is discovered which would result in everyone currently merely immobilized by Hell being killed by the hellfire.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #618</ref> Marlo soon uses the Death connection fragment to bring [[Doc Samson]], [[Jarella]], [[Hiroim]], and Rebecca Banner from the dead to help the Hulks in their fight against a resurrected [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], a [[Zom]]-possessed Doctor Strange, and the forces of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #619</ref>
