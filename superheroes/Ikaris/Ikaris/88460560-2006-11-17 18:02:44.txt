'''Ikaris''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a race appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  Both he and the Eternals were created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ikaris was born 20,000 years ago in [[Polaria]], in the area now known as Siberia.  He is the son of the Eternals [[Virako]] and [[Tulayn]].  His real birthname is unknown.  Ikaris' mother Tulayn died when he was only 300 years old

When the Second Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] sank the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] in what is known as the "Great Cataclysm," Ikaris guides a ship of humans to safety.  The humans mistake Ikaris for a bird, and (as per [[Marvel Universe]] history) he is memorialized as the dove that guided [[Noah]] to the [[Mountains of Ararat]] (''Eternals'' vol. 1, #2).

Ikaris chose his name due to a tragic accident hundreds of years ago.  While fighting the [[Deviants]] in ancient [[Greece]], the man eventually known as Ikaris meets and weds a human woman.  Together they bare a son named [[Icarus]], who loves to soar with his father high above the seas and mountains of Greece. In time, the Eternal builds his son a set of mechanical wings so the boy can fly on his own.  When his father disappears while fighting the Deviants, the young Icarus seeks him out using the mechanical wings.  Too inexperienced to fly on his own, young Icarus soars too high, loses consciousness in the upper atmosphere, and falls to his death.  Finding his son dead, the father Eternal takes the name of his son, ''Ikaris'', in his memory.

Around 1000 AD, Virako, Ikaris' father, dies in battle against the Deviant [[Dromedan]].  Ikaris is then adopted by his uncle [[Valkin]], who reveals to him his secret Arctic home, the Pyramid of the Winds.

In 1823, as part of the Eternals' preparation for the coming of the Fourth Host of the Celestials, [[Zuras]] orders Ikaris to perfect his cosmic senses in anticpation of their coming.  When they draw near, Ikaris is ordered to go to the City of the Space Gods and revive the sleeping Eternal [[Ajak]] to greet them.  

When the Celestials arrives around a century and a half later, Ikaris succeeds in this mission with the aid of human archaeologist Dr. Daniel Damian and his daughter, Margo (''Eternals'' vol.1, #1).

During the Fourth Host, Valkin's son [[Druig]] captures and tortures Ikaris to force him to reveal the location of the Pyramid of the Winds.  Ikaris catches up with Druig and kills him, but not before Druig is able to fire a weapon at a Celestial.  Fortunately, the Celestial is unharmed.

During his long lifetime, Ikaris also attempts to be a fair and just leader of the Eternals, but has abandoned Eternal traditions to take an active and public role in protecting the human race.  He has even adopted a unique human identity by fighting in the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] as "Iceberg" Ike Harris.

Ikaris and fellow Eternal [[Thena]] have had a strong dislike for each other for a long time, and find themselves coming to conflict when she is appointed as [[Prime Eternal]]. Questioning her worth as Prime Eternal, Ikaris faces her in the Hall of Eternal Judgement and defeats her, becoming the new Prime Eternal. 

In ''The New Eternals'' series, Ikaris still retains the title of Prime Eternal. When [[Apocalypse (comics)| Apocalypse]] detonates a nuclear warhead on [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria]], he causes Ikaris's father Virako to return to life. Although Ikaris is defeated by Apocalypse, he manages to destroy his ship and thwart Apocalypse's plan. Virako is appalled to find the Eternals accepting Deviants such as [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Karkas]].  Under the alias of "Sovereign", he introduces the Eternals to the world as a team of super-heroes called the "New Breed". 

===Eternals mini-series (2006)===
{{spoiler}}
Ikaris is featured in the Marvel mini-series ''Eternals'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and penciled by artist [[John Romita, Jr]].  The [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by former Eternal [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]], and thus have forgotten their true identities. Although Ikaris (calling himself Ike Harris) is captured and atomized by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] [[Gelt]] and [[Morjak]],  his body reappears at the bottom of the (fictional) [[Antarctic]] city of Olympia. His body and powers fully restored by the sentient city, Ikaris regains his memories and sets out to awaken his fellow Eternals to their true identities.

==Powers and abilities==
As an Eternal, Ikaris possesses a number of powers far beyond those of normal humans, including:
*Superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes;
*manipulation of cosmic energy (including the ability to project beams of energy from his eyes and hands);
*immunity to disease, aging, and fatigue;
*superhuman resistance to injury and temperature extremes;
*regenerative powers (Note: with the aid of [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] technology, Ikaris' body can be completely regenerated after almost total atomization);
*ability to manipulate matter at an atomic level;
*levitation of himself and/or others through mental control;
*limited psionic powers, including illusion casting and telepathy;
*creation of force shields around himself and/or others;
*limited teleportation; and
*superhuman sensory perception, far greater than even those of most Eternals.

*There is an alternate future version of Ikaris in the [[Marvel 2099]] universe.  He appears in ''2099: Manifest Destiny''.
