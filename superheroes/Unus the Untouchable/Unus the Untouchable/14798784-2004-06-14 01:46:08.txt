'''Unus the Untouchable''' is a [[mutant]] from [[Marvel Comics]].  He possesses a strong force field which protects him from harm (so long as he puts it up, which is not automatic).  Originally from [[Italy]], he was named Angelo Unuscione, but changed his name to Gunther Bain when he came to the United States.

He became a good friend of the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], and they teamed up together on various schemes and in an incarnation of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].  During a battle with [[Spider-Man]], Unus's force-field became so thick that he could not breathe; the Blob believed Unus to be dead.  Unus disappeared for many years, but reappeared recently on the destroyed island of [[Genosha]], traumatized by the devastation and speaking of "ghosts".
