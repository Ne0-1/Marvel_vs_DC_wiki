'''Unus the Untouchable''' ('''Angelo Unuscione''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[comic book]] [[X-Men]] and part of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Unus possesses a strong force field which protects him from harm (so long as he puts it up; it is not automatic).  

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Angelo Unuscione was born in [[Milan, Italy]]. He later changed his name to Gunther Bain when he came to the United States.<ref>Official Handbook of Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition #14</ref> Once in America he sought out the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to join them and fought the X-Men alongside the group. During the battle his powers were enhanced by a shot fired from Beast's gun.<ref>[Uncanny] X-Men vol. 1 #8</ref> He became a good friend of the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]],<ref>[Uncanny] X-Men vol. 1 #20</ref> and they teamed up together on various schemes, such as framing the [[X-Men]] for robbery,<ref>[Uncanny] X-Men vol. 1 #20</ref> before both mutants went their separate ways.

===Factor Three/Brotherhood===
Unus then joined the villainous organization Factor Three<ref> [Uncanny] X-Men vol. 1 #37</ref> fighting the X-Men and later visiting Ogre at their Mt Charteris base.<ref>Thunderbolts vol. 1 #33</ref> However, shortly after he was captured by Sentinels alongside several others mutants but was later released,<ref>[Uncanny] X-Men vol. 1 #59</ref><ref>Avengers vol. 1 #103</ref> after which he joined an incarnation of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. As a member of the Brotherhood, Unus was among their many earlier battles including against the X-Men and [[Kruger]],<ref>X-Men: The Hidden Years #11</ref> the X-Man, Beast<ref>Amazing Adventures #12</ref> and against the Defenders.<ref>Defenders vol. 1 #15</ref> When their mutant team member, [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]] reduced the entire Brotherhood to infancy, Unus was amongst them and kept at [[Muir Island]].<ref>[Uncanny] X-Men #104</ref> When the Brotherhood was reaged and reorganized, Unus was among the recruits and fought alongside the group against the Champions.<ref>Champions #17</ref> However he left the team disheartened but came in conflict with Hulk,<ref>Incredible Hulk Annual #11</ref> Power Man and Iron Fist.<ref>Power Man & Iron Fist #90</ref>

Not long after, Unus decided to retire from the life of the organized supervillain, deciding to use his talents in less "lofty" ways; he was making a living as a wrestler. At some point, he fathered the Canadian mutant [[Radius (comics)|Radius]]. It is also believed that the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolyte]] [[Unuscione|Carmella Unuscione]] is either his daughter or sister, but no official confirmation of this has ever been given.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

===Death===
Coming out of retirement and reteaming with his friend the Blob, Unus discovered, during another fight against the Hulk that his powers were out of control<ref>Marvel Fanfare #7</ref> and while battling with [[Spider-Man]], Unus lost complete control of his powers, and his force-field became so thick that it repulsed the very oxygen molecules in the air until he passed out. Falling into the Blob's arms, the former believed Unus to be dead. Unus disappeared for many years<ref>Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man #91</ref>

===Genosha===
However, Unus reappeared on the decimated island of [[Genosha]],<ref>New X-Men vol. 1 #132</ref> traumatized by the devastation and speaking of "ghosts." Usually arrogant and somewhat fearless, due in no small part to his invulnerable force field, he was shaken by apparent "ghosts" being able to pass through it. At some point, he stopped seeing them, and returned to his former hubris. 

Unus later formed his own band of mutant rebels (which includes Toad and [[Paralyzer]]), trying to survive on the harsh island that had become Genosha.<ref>Excalibur vol. 3 #2</ref> They most commonly had arguments with Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto, and surprisingly never recognized Magneto out of costume. In their first confrontation, the mutant known as [[Freakshow (comics)|Freakshow]] ends up literally swallowing Unus in order to end the tensions. His powers protected him. 

Unus leads Appraiser and Stripmine, two superhuman poachers, to Genosha<ref>Excalibur vol. 3 #5</ref> which caused him to be at odds with all the remaining mutants on Genosha.<ref>Excalibur vol. 3 #7</ref>

===House of M and Second Death===
Unus stayed on the island until before the [[House of M]], and was depowered after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. 

Unus is later found by Quicksilver on Genosha. Quicksilver granted him his powers back, however in an altered form.<ref>Son of M #5</ref> The [[Office of National Emergency]] soon stepped in and took the mists from Quicksilver and his daughter. [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] managed to teleport Luna and Pietro away before ONE could capture them, leaving a battle between the Inhumans and the repowered mutants of Genosha. During the battle Unus faced [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], who was amazed he could not break Unus' shield. However, Unus' powers soon evolved beyond his control and a pink metallic shell began to form all over his body. Both the Inhumans and the repowered mutants tried to save Unus' life, but it was too late. As Unus' field began to dissolve, it was discovered that he had died from lack of oxygen.<ref>Son of M #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Unus the Untouchable possessed the power to generate a psionic barrier of energy around his body. This energy served to push away or deflect nearby objects. Unus has deflected beams of energy, objects of high mass, objects travelling at high speed and telepathy, including that of [[Charles Xavier]].

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Unus in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] (also known as Earth-295) was a Prelate in [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] Infinites. Prelate Unus's appearance was cut short, however, as he was frozen by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and shattered.<ref>''X-Men Alpha''</ref>

===Ultimate Unus===
Unus also appeared briefly within the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe|Ultimate Universe]] as a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]]. In this version, he had some sort of astral projection powers. In the 3rd volume of The Ultimates, Unus is charged with protecting Magneto's citadel from the Ultimates. His forcefield deflects blows from Thor, but ultimately, Thor broke through and apparently killed Unus for defying a god.

===House of M===
In the "House of M", Unus was a lieutenant of Exodus and was eradicating the remaining human population in Australia. However, while tracking several runaway humans he stumbled upon and attempted to destroy a tribe of Aborigines who had adopted the Hulk into their midst. In the ensuing conflict, Unus was severely injured and put in hospital.<ref>Incredible Hulk vol. 3 #83</ref>
