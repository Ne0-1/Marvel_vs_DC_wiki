|}}'''Unus the Untouchable''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[comic book]] [[X-Men]] and part of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].  A [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]], Unus possesses a strong force field which protects him from harm (so long as he puts it up, which is not automatic).  

==History==

Originally from [[Italy]], Unus was born Angelo Unuscione, later changing his name to Gunther Bain when he came to the United States. Early on, he became a good friend of the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], and they teamed up together on various schemes, such as framing the [[X-Men]] for robbery, before both mutants went their separate ways. Unus joined the villainous organization Factor Three, and later, an incarnation of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Not long after joining, Unus decided to retire from the life of the organized supervillain, deciding to use his talents in less "lofty" ways; he was making a living as a wrestler.

During a battle with [[Spider-Man]], Unus lost control of his powers, and his force-field became so thick that it repulsed the very oxygen molecules in the air until he passed out.  Falling into the Blob's arms, the former believed Unus to be dead. Unus disappeared for many years, but reappeared recently on the decimated island of [[Genosha]], traumatized by the devastation and speaking of "ghosts". Usually arrogant and somewhat fearless, due in no small part to his invulnerable force field, he was shaken by apparent "ghosts" being able to pass through it. At some point, he stopped seeing them, and returned to his former hubris. He has two sons, [[Flex (comics)|Flex]] and [[Radius (comics)|Radius]], both of whom were members of [[Alpha Flight]]; it is suspected that [[Unuscione|Carmella Unuscione]] of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] is his daughter.

Unus later formed his own band of mutant rebels, trying to survive on the harsh island that had become Genosha. They most commonly had arguments with Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto, though surprisingly Unus never recognized Magneto out of costume. Unus stayed on the island until before the [[House of M]] began, and was depowered in the Decimation. 

{{spoiler}}

In ''Son of M #6'', Unus died after his shield (now overpowered by the Terrigen Mists) blocked out his air supply.

==Alternate Versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===

Unus in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] (also known as Earth-295) was a Prelate in [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] Infinites.  Prelate Unus's appearance was cut short, however, as he was frozen by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and shattered in the pages of ''X-Men Alpha''.

===Ultimate===

Unus also appeared briefly within the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe|Ultimate Universe]] as a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]].  In this version, he has some sort of astral projection powers.

==Powers==

Unus the Untouchable possesses the power to generate a psionic barrier of energy around his body.  This energy serves to push away or deflect nearby objects.  With concentration, Unus can deflect beams of energy, objects of high mass, or objects travelling at high speed.  At its highest concentration, Unus can form an [[Invisible Woman]]-like shield around his entire body.


*'Unus is a mutant with the psionic ability to generate a field of invisible psionic energy around his body. This energy is comparable to the solid force psionically projected by the Invisible Woman but is ordinarily much more wave-like in form. As a result, at ordinary power levels, the field acts to deflect objects or even intense energy beams which come in contact with the outer limit of the field. Unus can mentally increase the intensity of the field so as to deflect a large object or objects traveling at unusually high rates of speed. Through further concentration, Unus can "harden" this wave-like field into a conventional protective force field similar to that with which the Invisible Woman surrounds herself. The field then acts like an indestructible bubble around Unus's body. In this form, the field even reaches beneath Unus's feet as he stands, so that he actually stands and walks on the field, not on the floor or ground. Unus can turn the field on and off or raise or lower its intensity at will. He can even shut off a small portion of the field, thereby allowing himself to reach through the opening and touch his opponents while the rest of him remains untouchable. When the field has "hardened," he can maintain it at a highly intense level very close to his body or to any weapon he carries, so as to greatly increase the force of any blow he may strike with the weapon or with his fists.

The limits of this field have not yet been determined. It has easily survived being struck with enough force to shatter a brick wall without sustaining damage, either to itself or to Unus. Certain types of radiant energy, such as sunlight, pass through the field, as do air and hence, sound waves. Whether this means that Unus is vulnerable to attack by lasers, gas, or intense acoustic force is not yet known either. It is also possible that his force field naturally screens out all energy over a certain threshold. It is also unknown whether Unus can project psionic force into various forms which do not surround all or part of his body, as the Invisible Woman does.
