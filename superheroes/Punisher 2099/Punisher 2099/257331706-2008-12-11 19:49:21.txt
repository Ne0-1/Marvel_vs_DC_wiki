'''''The Punisher 2099''''' is a [[comic book]] series following the account of Jake Gallows a.k.a. the [[Punisher]] in the year 2099 in an alternate [[Marvel Universe]]. The majority of the issues were written by [[Pat Mills]] & [[Tony Skinner]], art by [[Tom Morgan (comics)|Tom Morgan]]. The rest were written by [[Chuck Dixon]]. The series ran from February [[1993 in comics|1993]] through November of [[1995 in comics|1995]] with a total of 34 issues.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Jake Gallows''', a member of the Public Eye Police Force (a private police protection service charging money to citizens) and Church of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], lost his mother, brother and sister-in-law (and was himself seriously injured), when they were slain on the orders of Kron Stone, psychotic son of powerful businessman [[Tyler Stone (comics)|Tyler Stone]]. After recovering, Jake comes across the original Punisher's war journal, stolen from the archives of the Public Eye. The last page bore the challenge: "You who find this, I charge you to carry on my work." Soon after, he became the new Punisher.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #1</ref> Jake would find revenge against Kron Stone, or so he believed. Kron, after threatening the lives of several children, confronts Jake with a device that stops all high-speed projectiles, such as bullets. Jake pulls a knife and slowly stabs Kron, who seemingly dies.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #2</ref> Tyler's technological resources bring him back to life at a later date.{{issue}}

Jake fought against the unique crimes of the dystopian 2099 future. He kills rogue organ-thieves, those who track down and steal organs from unwilling victims. He tries to protect those who cannot afford their police subscriptions and thus are ignored. Conversely, he also goes after those who use their money to get away with crimes. Jake also deals with a technologically minded partner named Matt Axel, and struggles with the uncaring attitudes of his bosses and colleagues towards the poor and the attentions of a police psychiatrist who believes Jake is up to something. Jake battled such foes as the Street Surgeons,<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #50</ref> Saucers (who he executed after the death of one of his victims),<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #3</ref> the Cyber-Nostra,<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #4</ref>, and Multi-Fractor.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #5-6</ref> Over the course of the series he would deal with a recurring villain who causes grotesque physical transformations with his hand, named the [[Fearmaster]].<ref>first in ''Punisher 2099'' #8</ref>

For a time, Jake establishes a prison underneath his house (regular prisons have been abolished) and instead years are subtracted from people's lives by injection. Occasionally he would sentence one to death in a molecular destabilizer if he felt their crimes truly horrific. Jake himself ponders the merits of such a facility. After a carefully planned breakout, most of the prisoners died. The prison was rarely seen again.

Along with other current era heroes, such as [[Bloodhawk]], [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]], and [[Ravage 2099|Ravage]], the new Punisher would help to bring down the false [[Norse mythology|Norse Gods]]. He struck the final blows against Thor, his patron deity. 

Jake encounters several 'versions' of classic heroes where he arrives to protect a poor neighborhood from a Cyber Nostra land grab. The people, celebrating the old heroes by dressing up like them, reject Jake's violent ways, even when the Nostra kill the 'Barrio Man', their leader. When all the Nostra are dead, the new Barrio Man, who seems to be someone else with an identical costume, approaches Jake. He expresses gratitude for Jake's help but asks that he leave.

Unlike his predecessor, Jake is completely unwilling to kill corrupt police officers, no matter how heinous their crimes. In one instance, he refuses after several officers try and kill him with a cyborg gladiator. After Jake manages to kill the gladiator, the officers attempt to kill Jake themselves. He hides, refusing to fire, but his suit is over-ridden by his partner Matt, who kills the cops (ironically, Matt himself is a policeman, and, as a more sensible, charitable man, usually acts as Jake's conscience). Matt would be involved with several more incidents with the Punisher, sometimes teaming up with others to help him.

Jake later confronts illegal hoverboard racers. These races would result in many deaths, as the riders were not averse to tricking each other into fatal obstacles. Oddly, racers would willingly catch any opponents who fell off their board. 

===Corruption===
Ultimately, Jake would become the premiere law enforcer under the [[Doom 2099 (comics)|Doom]] administration, as the Minister of Punishment, head of the Ministry of Punishment, Federal Law Enforcement for the [[United States]]. He creates a new police force with wide-ranging powers. Curfews are enforced. The age of legal responsibility is lowered to seven. Matt Axel joins up with the Punisher again, working out of his mobile base. He literally quits on the spot after believing Jake has gone too far in employing thought-crime devices. In detecting homicidal tendencies in one man, the devices scan the neighbors next door who are simply enjoying spousal activities. It is not confirmed what the activities are but the Punisher clearly indicates he disapproves of them, that they aren't illegal...yet.

The homicidal man is confronted and subdued after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer. The Punisher forces one of his officers to kill the man. 

During this time, he confronts an alternate reality version of himself that is much more brutal. Jake Gallows dies defending Doom against the wave-spiders of Anthony Herod.

==Abilities, equipment and base of operations==
Jake Gallows is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. As a Public Eye Officer, Gallows has received police training in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts and is an expert marksman and motorcyclist. He is also a weapons expert, collecting some of the best weaponry of his time, including smart-targeting grenazers, a plasma gas cannon, and flame sticks; additionally he carries some notable firearms from the past, including a Smith & Wesson .54 caliber Magnum handgun (2015 vintage) and a Stark-Fujikawa .48 caliber Street Pacifier. One of his key weapons is the "power bat" which can vary in density settings from hard rubber to titanium, to either injure or kill an opponent. Jake keeps this set at 'soft rubber' as default, a precaution which saves his life on at least one point.

The Punisher also wears a cybernetic suit of body armor of unknown materials with a "heat sink" capability, equipped with multiple technological devices, such as "face-scrambler" circuitry to avoid detection by the many security cameras on the city streets, and Turbo kickboots. The armor covers his exo-muscular undersuit, which is equipped with microwave sensors, a computer trajectory mapping system, and bio-synergetic capacity for programming with various martial arts techniques and fighting styles for hand-to-hand combat.

The Punisher also uses a super-sonic [[motorcycle]] for transportation, the H.D. Stealth Stinger. This is a unique police motorcycle capable of 800 mph speeds, equipped with an air screen, computer probability mapping system, city traffic system override capability, sound bafflers, inertia brakes, various weaponry, a projection holo-beam and wrap-around projection holo-image system enabling functional invisibility. He has also used the Black Ambulance, which is equipped with security support systems to prevent prisoner escape.

Jake keeps a secret base in the basement of his home. The base contains a complex prison, which he uses to temporarily detain prisoners. The Punisher [[interrogation|interrogates]] prisoners and when finished he executes them via an [[electric chair]]-like molecular disintegrator.
