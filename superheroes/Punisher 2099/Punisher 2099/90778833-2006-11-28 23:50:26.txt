'''''The Punisher 2099''''' is a [[comic book]] series following the account of Jake Gallows a.k.a. [[The Punisher]] in the year [[Marvel 2099|2099]] in an alternate [[Marvel Universe]] on Earth-928. The majority of the issues were written by [[Pat Mills]] & [[Tony Skinner]], art by [[Tom Morgan]]. The rest were written by [[Chuck Dixon]]. The series ran from February [[1993]] through November of [[1995]] with a total of 34 issues.

==Fictional character biography==
Jake Gallows, a member of the Public Eye Police Force and Church of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], lost his mother, brother and sister-in-law (and was himself seriously injured), when they were murdered by orders of [[Spiderman 2099#Character history|Kron Stone]]. After recovering, Jake had come across and stolen from the Public Eye archives the original Punisher's war journal. The last page bore the challenge: ''"You who find this, I charge you to carry on my work."'' Soon after, he became the new Punisher. Jake would find revenge against Kron Stone (Punisher 2099 #2), and establish his own brand of "justice" for 2099. Along with the other members of Marvel 2099, the new Punisher would help to bring down the false [[Norse mythology|Norse Gods]], striking the final blows against Thor, his patron deity. Ultimately, Jake would become the premiere law enforcer under the [[Doom 2099 (comics)|Doom]] administration, as the Minister of Punishment, head of the Ministry of Punishment, Federal Law Enforcement for the [[United States]]. Jake Gallows died defending Doom against the wave-spiders of Anthony Herod.

==Equipment & Base of Operations==
As a Public Eye Officer, Jake Gallows is a weapons expert, collecting some of the best future weaponry, in addition to some notable firearms from the past. One of his key weapons is the "power bat" which can vary in density, to either injure or kill an opponent.  The Punisher also wears a cybernetic suit capable of uploading various martial arts techniques for hand-to-hand combat. The Punisher also uses a super-sonic [[motorcycle]] for transportation.

Jake keeps a secret base in the basement of his home. The base contains a prison, which he uses to temporarily detain prisoners. The Punisher [[interrogation|interrogates]] prisoners and when finished he executes them via an [[electric chair]]-like molecular disentegrator.

==Trivia==
*In The Punisher 2099, Jake found the Punisher's war journal, which stated, ''"You who find this, I charge you to carry on my work"''. [[Garth Ennis]] would take a contrary view on the Punisher's legacy, as Ennis' Frank would not let anyone carry on his personal war on criminals. This is most notable in the ''Welcome Back Frank, Circle of Blood'' and ''Mother Russia'' storylines.

*Jake also had technical assistance from his friend, Matt Axel. The same manner Frank Castle had with his former partner, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]].
