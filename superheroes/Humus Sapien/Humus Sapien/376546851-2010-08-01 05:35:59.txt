He first appeared as '''Humus Sapiens''' in ''[[FOOM]]'' #3 (Autumn 1973), created by Michael A. Barreiro. He first appeared as Humus Sapien in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #54 (Sept. 2001), by the writer-artist team of [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Patrick Zircher]].

==Publication history==
===FOOM===
Humus Sapien [[first appeared]] in Marvel's self-produced [[fanzine|fan magazine]], ''[[FOOM]]'' #&nbsp;3 (Fall 1973), created (as [[supervillain]] Humus Sapiens) by Michael A. Barreiro of [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania]], and was the winning entry in the magazine's character-creation contest.<ref name=samruby>[http://samruby.com/Series/FOOM/foom03.htm ''FOOM'' contents and checklist: Issue #&nbsp;3]. [http://www.webcitation.org/5rQZDtQER WebCitation archive].</ref> Although ''FOOM'' founding editor [[Jim Steranko]] wrote in the premiere-issue introduction that, "The winning entry (to be selected by Ol' Smilin' [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]] himself) will become a super guest-star featured in one of Marvel's top hero mags", this never occurred, and both the character and the contest faded into obscurity.

Barreiro later in the 1970s inquired at Marvel about the character, but received no response. Comics columnist [[Fred Hembeck]] in 1979 wrote in the magazine ''Buyer's Guide to Comic Fandom'' about the contest and Humus Sapiens, and though nothing immediately came of it, the column two decades later when prompt [[Tom Brevoort]], editor of Marvel's ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' comic book to call Barreiro with an offer to use the character. Barreiro in the interim had grown up to become a carpenter and a freelance artist living in the [[Carrick (Pittsburgh)|Carrick]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]].<ref name=post>Sodergren, Rebecca.

===Thunderbolts===
In 1998, writer [[Kurt Busiek]] and editor [[Tom Brevoort]] decided to use Barreiro's character in the [[superhero]] series ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]''. [[Fabian Nicieza]], who succeeded Busiek as 'Thunderbolts writer (and who, along with brother and future fellow Marvel editor [[Mariano Nicieza]] had also entered the ''FOOM'' contest), agreed. Renamed Humus Sapien, the character eventually debuted, after 28 years, in ''Thunderbolts'' #54 (Sept. 2001). Barreiro was allowed to [[inker|ink]] one page of the issue featuring the character.<ref name=post />

==Fictional character biography==
Humus Sapien was discovered by the Thunderbolts, when he emerged from a [[suspended animation]] chamber in which he had been imprisoned. He has vaguely defined superhuman abilities powered by Earth's population. Each time he uses his powers, however, random people around the world die. Humus Sapien's final battle, after which he voluntarily leaves Earth, drains the lives of 2,400 people, including the [[Middle Eastern]] costumed crimefighter the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]].
