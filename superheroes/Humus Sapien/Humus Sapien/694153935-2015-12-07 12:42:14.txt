==Publication history==

===FOOM===
Humus Sapien [[first appeared]] in Marvel's self-produced [[fanzine|fan magazine]], ''[[FOOM]]'' #&nbsp;3 (Fall 1973), created (as [[supervillain]] Humus Sapiens) by Michael A. Barreiro of [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], [[Pennsylvania]], and was the winning entry in the magazine's character-creation contest.<ref name=samruby>[http://samruby.com/Series/FOOM/foom03.htm ''FOOM'' contents and checklist: Issue #&nbsp;3]. [http://www.webcitation.org/5rQZDtQER WebCitation archive].</ref> Although ''FOOM'' founding editor [[Jim Steranko]] wrote in the premiere-issue introduction that, "The winning entry (to be selected by Ol' Smilin' [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]] himself) will become a super guest-star featured in one of Marvel's top hero mags", this never occurred, and both the character and the contest faded into obscurity.

Later, Barreiro inquired about the character but received no response from Marvel. ''Buyer's Guide to Comic Fandom'' columnist, [[Fred Hembeck]], wrote in 1979, about the character and contest and, though nothing immediately came of it, the column prompted [[Tom Brevoort]], editor of Marvel's ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' comic book, to call Barreiro two decades later with an offer to use the character.<ref name=post>{{cite news|last=Sodergren|first= Rebecca|url=http://www.postgazette.com/ae/20010814comic0814p4.asp |title=Bad Guy Finally Finishes First|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date=August 14, 2001|accessdate=October 10, 2011|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5rQYmG0K0 | archivedate=July 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}.</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
In 1998, writer [[Kurt Busiek]] and editor [[Tom Brevoort]] decided to use Barreiro's character in the [[superhero]] series, ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]''. [[Fabian Nicieza]], who succeeded Busiek as ''Thunderbolts'' writer, agreed. (Nicieza had also entered the FOOM contest.) Renamed Humus Sapien, the character eventually debuted, after 28 years, in ''Thunderbolts'' #54 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 2001). Barreiro was allowed to [[inker|ink]] one page of the issue featuring the character.<ref name=post />

==Fictional character biography==
Humus Sapien was discovered by the Thunderbolts when he emerged from a [[suspended animation]] chamber in which he had been imprisoned.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #54, 2002</ref> He has vaguely defined superhuman abilities powered by Earth's population, however, each time he uses his powers, random people around the world die. Humus Sapien's final battle, after which he voluntarily leaves Earth, drains the lives of 2,400 people, including the [[Middle Eastern]] superhero, the [[Arabian Knight (comics)#Abdul Qamar|Arabian Knight]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #55, 2002</ref>
