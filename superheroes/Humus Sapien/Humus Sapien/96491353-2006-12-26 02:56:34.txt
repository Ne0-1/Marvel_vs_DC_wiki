'''Humus Sapien (Sony Baredo)''' is the name of a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic book]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. 

==Publication history==
Humus Sapien [[first appeared]] in Marvel's self-produced [[fanzine|fan magazine]], ''[[FOOM]]'' #3 (Fall 1973), created (as [[supervillian]] Humus Sapiens) by Michael A. Barreiro of [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Pittsburgh]], and was the winning entry in the magazine's character-creation contest. Although ''FOOM'' founding editor [[Jim Steranko]] wrote in the in the premiere-issue introduction that, "The winning entry (to be selected by Ol' Smilin' [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]] himself) will become a super guest-star featured in one of Marvel's top hero mags", this never occurred, and both the character and the contest faded into obscurity.

Barreiro later in the '70s inquired at Marvel about the charcter, but received no response. Comics columnist [[Fred Hembeck]] in 1979 wrote in the magazine ''Buyer's Guide to Comic Fandom'' about the contest and Humus Sapiens, but nothing came of it. Barreiro grew up to become a carpenter and a freelance artist living in the [[Carrick (Pittsburgh)|Carrick]] neighborhood, and did a small amount of work for Marvel and [[Dark Horse Comics]].

In 1998, writer [[Kurt Busiek]] and editor [[Tom Brevoort]] decided to use Barreiro's character in the [[superhero]] series ''[[Thunderbolts]]''. [[Fabian Nicieza]], who succeeded Busiek as ''[[Thunderbolts]]'' writer (and who, along with brother and future fellow Marvel editor [[Mariano Nicieza]] had also entered the ''FOOM'' contest), agreed. Renamed Humus Sapien, the character eventually debuted, after 28 years, in ''Thunderbolts'' #55 (Sept. 2001).

==Fictional character biography==
===Thunderbolts===
Humus Sapien emerged from a [[suspended animation]] chamber in which he had been imprisoned. He has vaguely defined superhuman abilities powered by Earth's population. Each time he uses his powers, however, random people around the world die. Humus Sapien's final battle, after which he voluntarily leaves Earth, drains the lives of 2,400 people, including the [[Middle Eastern]] costumed crimefighter the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]]).
