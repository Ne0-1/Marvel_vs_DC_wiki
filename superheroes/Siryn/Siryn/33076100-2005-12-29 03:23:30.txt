'''Siryn''' is a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]], best known as a member of the [[X-Men]] offshoot [[X-Force]]. Like her father, the X-Men&#8217;s [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Siryn (real name Theresa Rourke Cassidy) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[mutant]], who possesses the ability to fly and a "sonic scream" capable of injuring an opponent's hearing and sending powerful vibrations through the air. Her name derives from the [[siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]].

==Comic book history==
While Sean Cassidy was away, working for [[INTERPOL]],  his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa. Not much later, Maeve died in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean,  his cousin [[Black Tom Cassidy|Tom]] took care of Theresa. When Sean returned to learn of his wifeâ€™s death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

Tom (now known as Black Tom) would raise Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. Eventually, Theresa accompanied Black Tom and his partner, the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], to [[San Francisco]] to assist him in his crimes. Here, employing the name Siryn, she battled the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and several of the X-Men. This conflict ended in Black Tom's temporary capture. While in custody, Black Tom exonerated Theresa of responsibility for her crimes and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was. The X-Men brought Theresa back to their headquarters, where she was joyfully reunited with her father. 

Throughout the 1990s, Siryn was a member of [[X-Force]], a [[platoon]]-like superhero team and for a time was its field leader. As a member of X-Force, she developed a relationship with her teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and a flirtation with the mutant mercenary [[Deadpool]].  She left in 1998, when [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], a former teammate gone bad, slashed her throat, destroying her vocal chords - rendering her [[mute]] and powerless.

Thanks to the aid of [[Deadpool]], Siryn has since fully healed and was briefly a member of the [[Paris]] branch of the international mutant task force [[X-Corporation]]. She is currently aiding Deadpool and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] in tracking down the missing [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

She is slated to appear in the upcoming ''[[X-Factor]]'' series.

==Appearance in ''X2''==
In both the 2000 [[X-Men (film)|''X-Men'' film]] and its 2003 sequel ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', several X-Men characters made [[cameo role|cameo]] appearances as young students at Xavier's School for the Gifted. In ''X2'', actress [[Shauna Kain]] portrayed the red-haired mutant. She will reprise the role in ''[[X3 (film)|X3]].''
