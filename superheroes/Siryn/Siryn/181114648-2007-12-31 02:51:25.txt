'''Siryn''' ('''Theresa Rourke Cassidy''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Steve Leialoha]], she first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #37 ([[1981#April|April 1981]]).

Like her father, the X-Men’s [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Siryn is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], who possesses a "sonic scream" capable of incapacitating and injuring an opponent's hearing and sending powerful vibrations through the air. She can use these vibrations to fly. Her name refers to the [[Siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]].

Siryn was raised by Banshee’s cousin and arch-nemesis [[Black Tom Cassidy]] without Banshee's knowledge. As an adult, she has left Black Tom and joined the X-Men offshoots [[X-Force]] and [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===

While Sean Cassidy was working on a deep undercover mission for [[INTERPOL]],  his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa. Not much later, Maeve died in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean,  his cousin [[Black Tom Cassidy|Tom]] took care of Theresa. When Sean returned to learn of his wife’s death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

Tom (now known as [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]]) would raise Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. Eventually, Theresa accompanied Black Tom and his then-partner, the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], to [[San Francisco]] to assist him in his crimes. Here, employing the name Siryn, she battled the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and several of the X-Men. This conflict ended in Black Tom's temporary capture. While in custody, Black Tom exonerated Theresa of responsibility for her crimes and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was. The X-Men brought Theresa back to their headquarters, where she was joyfully reunited with her father.

===Muir Island===
Theresa moved to [[Muir Island]], home of the research laboratories of [[Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], a longtime ally of [[Professor Xavier]].  While living on the island, Siryn started a romantic relationship with the mutant known as [[Multiple Man]].  This version of Multiple Man turned out to be one of his many duplicates and not the original Multiple Man.  During this time Siryn and Multiple Man traveled to [[New York City]] to help the [[New Mutants]] find two of their members, [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], who had run away from the school.  In the course of this adventure, Siryn and Multiple Man met the association of street-level mutants known as the [[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]].

===X-Force===

Throughout the 1990s, Siryn was a member of [[X-Force]], a [[paramilitary]] superhero team and for a time was its field leader. As a member of X-Force, she develops a romantic relationship with her teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and a flirtation with the mercenary [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]. They initially became involved when the two met while fighting Black Tom and the Juggernaut. Though Banshee warns Siryn that Deadpool was a madman and a murderer, she found herself quite taken with him, even looking past his horrific appearance. At first, she is comforted that he would watch over her. Over time, Siryn became the voice of reason and sanity in Deadpool's ear, attempting to sway him to the side of good. She assists him in some of his missions, such as when Deadpool felt he needed some blood from the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in order to cure problems with his own healing powers. In the end, however, Siryn becomes frustrated and scared at Deadpool's worsening sanity, and breaks off her attempts. She and Warpath make this clear to Deadpool during a visit to the baseball diamond used in the movie, [[Field of Dreams]]. 

Siryn confronts varied adversaries. She helps put down a coup in the other dimensional realm of [[Asgard]]. She confronts the forces of Onslaught and the interdimensional media mogul known as [[Mojo]]. She even battles [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces on more than one occasion. She also confronts more down to earth problems, particularly [[alcoholism]].

She becomes a vital part of the team, as said so by an aspect of [[Charles Xavier]] in issue #68, which saves the entire team from a near-death experience. 

She leaves in 1998, when [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], a former teammate turned villain, slashes her throat, destroying her vocal cords and rendering her [[speech disorder|mute]] and powerless.

===X-Corporation===

Thanks to the aid of Deadpool, Siryn has since fully healed. She was briefly a member of the [[Paris]] branch of the international mutant task force [[X-Corporation]]. She was re-united with old friends such as [[Multiple Man]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. Their first mission did not go well and Siryn had to deal with the loss of another friend, [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]]. 

===X-Factor Investigations===

Siryn is currently a member of [[X-Factor Investigations]]. Siryn, as part of her initial duties for X-Factor Investigations, was investigating a murder of the woman who died in Jack Vaughn’s (a movie star) penthouse under suspicious circumstances. Jack Vaughn claimed that the woman was killed by her sister, Gloria Santiago, who was upset about the relationship (claiming that Jack was “no good” for her sister), and that all he was trying to do was wrestle the gun away from her. The sister thus hired X-Factor Investigations to help her clear her name and bring Jack to justice. A rival firm, Singularity Investigations, was representing Jack Vaughn with [[Damian Tryp]], Junior (i.e., the youngest version) as the defense counsel. When Siryn and X-Factor Investigations managed to incriminate Vaughn and to thwart SI’s assassination attempt on [[Rictor]]<ref>X-Factor vol. 3 #3-4</ref>, so infuriated was Tryp Junior that he ambushed Siryn and beat her almost to death, leaving her to die in an alley. She was later rescued by Rictor and brought back to the X-Factor Investigations office to recover. 

She is also in a state of [[denial]] regarding  her father's [[Deadly Genesis|recent demise]], though she correctly notes that many X-Men have [[comic book deaths|been believed dead only to later return alive]]. Due to these recent traumas and another fling with Multiple Man that went bad, Siryn is under considerable emotional strain.

After a convoluted love triangle with fellow teammates [[Multiple Man]] and [[M (comics)|Monet St. Croix]], Siryn's relationships with fellow X-Factor members have been strained.  She has since resolved her differences with St. Croix and the two have developed a budding friendship and partnership on recent missions.

Later, Theresa and Monet are sent to retrieve two famous child singers (who specialize in mutant hate songs) from their parents, thanks to a court order from their grandparents. The two end up being ambushed, knocked out, and kidnapped by the children's mutant bodyguards, [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]] and [[Clay (Marvel comics)|Clay]]. They awake to find themselves locked in a desert bunker, with Monet held to the floor with nearly indestructible chains and Theresa tied to a chair with a piece of [[duct tape]] covering her mouth, rendering both women powerless. Eventually, Monet is able to free herself and the two escape and return the children to their grandparents. It is revealed that the entire mission was a ruse by the mutant Josef Huber to lure the two women away from their X-Factor teammates. Both Monet and Siryn's mental-based powers negatively effect Huber's mind-control abilities.

==Powers and abilities==
Siryn possesses sonic powers similar to those of her father Banshee and [[Black Canary]] of the [[JLA]], although she is able to use her powers in ways that Banshee apparently cannot.  Like her father, she can emit high-decibel "sonic screams". She can also vary the pitch to deflect [[projectile]]s, and she even used it to deflect lasers once{{issue}}. She possesses an enhanced sense of hearing and can use her voice for [[echolocation]]. While screaming Siryn is able to fly, apparently due to a limited [[psionic]] ability. Siryn has especially potent sonic attacks. She can shatter objects, project sonic force, or cause pain and unconsciousness. 

Siryn is able to subtly influence and control others with her sonics, as well as cause them to enter a [[trance]]-like [[hypnotic]] state<ref>[[X-Factor Investigations|''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #1]]</ref>. This ability likens her to the mythical [[Siren]]s. She can also prevent others from hearing external sounds so that she can secretly deliver messages to them<ref>[[Cable & Deadpool|''Cable & Deadpool'' #17]]</ref>.  

Siryn has developed the ability to influence human beings with a certain pitch of her voice, causing them to fall in love with her (without regard to gender or sexual orientation) and carry out her wishes and commands<ref>X-Factor vol. 3 #1</ref>.  Siryn deploys this ability on [[Spider-Man]], leading him to divulge the truth about the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] of the mutants<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #8</ref>.

==In other media==
===Films===
*In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', Siryn was played by [[Shauna Kain]] in a small cameo role.  During [[William Stryker]]'s attack on the mansion, her scream alerts the rest of the school that they are under attack.  She was knocked out, but was rescued by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Her name (along with her father's) also appears on a list of names [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for Magneto's file.

*Kain reprised the role in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' in 2006.
