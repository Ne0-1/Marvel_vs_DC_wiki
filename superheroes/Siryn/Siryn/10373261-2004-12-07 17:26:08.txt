'''Siryn''' is a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]], best known as a member of the [[X-Men]] offshoot [[X-Force]]. Like her father, the X-Men’s [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Siryn (real name Theresa Rourke) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[mutant]], who possesses the ability to fly and a "sonic scream" capable of injuring an opponent's hearing and sending powerful vibrations through the air. Her name derives from the [[siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]].

==Comic book history==
Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Steve Leialoha]], Siryn first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #37 ([[April]] [[1981]]) as an apprentice of the [[super villain]]s [[Black Tom Cassidy]] and [[Juggernaut]]. It was later revealed that her father, Banshee, knew nothing of her existence and she was raised by his cousin and arch rival Black Tom after the death of her mother. Later, she left Tom and joined the X-Men’s cause.

Throughout the [[1990s]], Siryn was a member of [[X-Force]], a [[platoon]]-like superhero team and for a time was its field leader. As a member of X-Force, she developed a relationship with her teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and a flirtation with the mutant mercenary [[Deadpool]].  She left in [[1998]], when [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], a former teammate gone bad, slashed her throat, destroying her super-vocal chords.

Siryn has since fully healed and currently is a member of the [[Paris]] branch of the international mutant task force [[X-Corporation]].

==Appearance in ''X2''==
In both the [[2000]] [[X-Men (movie)|''X-Men'' film]] and its [[2003]] sequel ''[[X2|X2: X-Men United]]'', several X-Men characters made [[cameo role|cameo]] appearances as young students at Xavier’s School for Gifted. In ''X2'', actress [[Shauna Kain]] portrayed a red-haired mutant who belted out a glass-shattering scream, generally believed to be Siryn.
