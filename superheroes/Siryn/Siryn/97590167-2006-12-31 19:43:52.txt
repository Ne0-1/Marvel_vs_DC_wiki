'''Siryn''' ('''Theresa Rourke Cassidy''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Steve Leialoha]], she first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #37 ([[1981#April|April 1981]]).

Like her father, the X-Men’s [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Siryn is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[mutant]], who possesses the ability to fly and a "sonic scream" capable of incapacitating and injuring an opponent's hearing and sending powerful vibrations through the air. Her name derives from the [[siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]].

Siryn was raised by Banshee’s cousin and arch-nemesis [[Black Tom Cassidy]] without his knowledge. As an adult, she has left Black Tom and joined the X-Men offshoots [[X-Force]] and [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]]. 

==Character history==
{{spoilers}}
While Sean Cassidy was away, working for [[INTERPOL]],  his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa. Not much later, Maeve died in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean,  his cousin [[Black Tom Cassidy|Tom]] took care of Theresa. When Sean returned to learn of his wife’s death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

Tom (now known as [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]]) would raise Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. Eventually, Theresa accompanied Black Tom and his partner, the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], to [[San Francisco]] to assist him in his crimes. Here, employing the name Siryn, she battled the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and several of the X-Men. This conflict ended in Black Tom's temporary capture. While in custody, Black Tom exonerated Theresa of responsibility for her crimes and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was. The X-Men brought Theresa back to their headquarters, where she was joyfully reunited with her father.

Theresa moved to [[Muir Island]], home of the research laboratories of [[Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], a longtime ally of [[Professor Xavier]].  While living on the island, Siryn started a romantic relationship with the mutant known as [[Multiple Man]].  This version of Multiple Man turned out to be one of his many duplicates and not the original Multiple Man.  During this time Siryn and Multiple Man traveled to [[New York City]] to help the [[New Mutants]] find two of their members, [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], who had run away from the school.  In the course of this adventure, Siryn and Multiple Man met the association of street-level mutants known as the [[Fallen Angels]].

Throughout the 1990s, Siryn was a member of [[X-Force]], a [[paramilitary]] superhero team and for a time was its field leader. As a member of X-Force, she developed a relationship with her teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and a flirtation with the mercenary [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], as well as battled with [[alcoholism]].  She left in 1998, when [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], a former teammate turned villain, slashed her throat, destroying her vocal chords—rendering her [[speech disorder|mute]] and powerless.

Thanks to the aid of Deadpool, Siryn has since fully healed and was briefly a member of the [[Paris]] branch of the international mutant task force [[X-Corporation]].

Siryn is currently a member of [[X-Factor Investigations]]. Siryn, as part of her initial duties for X-Factor Investigations, was investigating a murder of the woman who died in Jack Vaughn’s pent house (a movie star) under suspicious circumstances. Jack Vaughn claimed that the woman was killed by her sister, Gloria Santiago, who was upset about the relationship (claiming that Jack was “no good” for her sister), and that all he was trying to do was wrestle the gun away from her. The sister thus hired X-Factor Investigations to help her clear her name and bring Jack to justice. Singularity Investigations was representing Jack Vaughn with [[Damian Tryp]], Junior (i.e., the youngest version) as the defense counsel. In X-Factor # 3-4, when Siryn and X-Factor Investigations managed to incriminate Vaughn and to thwart SI’s assassination attempt on [[Rictor]] (another member of X-Factor Investigations), so infuriated was Tryp, Junior that he ambushed Siryn and beat her almost to death, leaving her to die in an alley. She was later rescued by Rictor and brought back to the X-Factor Investigations office to recover. 

She is also in a state of [[denial]] regarding  her father's [[Deadly Genesis|recent demise]], correctly noting that many X-Men have [[comic book deaths|been believed dead only to later return alive]]. Due to these recent traumas, Siryn is under considerable emotional strain.

==Powers==
Siryn possesses sonic powers similar to those of her father Banshee, although she is able to use her powers in ways that he apparently cannot.  Like her father, she can emit high-decibel "sonic screams". She can also vary the pitch to deflect [[projectile]]s, and she even used it to deflect lasers once{{issue}}. She possesses an enhanced sense of hearing and sonar. While screaming Siryn is able to fly. Siryn has especially potent sonic attacks. She can shatter objects, project sonic force, or cause pain and unconsciousness. 

Siryn is able to subtly influence and control others with her sonics as well as cause them to enter a trancelike state.([[X-Factor Investigations|''X-Factor'' v3 #1]]) This ability likens her to the mythical [[Siren]]s. Siryn shows the ability to also block out others from hearing sounds so that she can secretly deliver messages([[Cable & Deadpool|''Cable & Deadpool'' #17]]).  

Most recently, in the series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (volume 3), it was shown that Siryn has also developed an ability to influence human beings with a certain pitch of her voice, causing them to fall in love with her without regard to gender or sexual orientation.  This new facet of her powers has been stated not to work on mutants{{issue}}.  In ''X-Factor'' #8, a ''Civil War'' tie-in issue, this ability is shown to work on [[Spider-Man]], allowing Siryn to learn the truth about the Decimation.
