'''Siryn''' ('''Theresa Rourke Cassidy''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], associated with the [[X-Men]].

Like her father, the X-Men's [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Siryn is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], who possesses a "sonic scream" capable of incapacitating and injuring an opponent's hearing and sending powerful vibrations through the air. She can use these vibrations to fly. Her name refers to the [[Siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]].

Siryn was raised by Banshee’s cousin and arch-nemesis [[Black Tom Cassidy]] without Banshee's knowledge. By her early teens, she left Black Tom and joined the X-Men offshoots [[X-Force]] and [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Steve Leialoha]], Siryn first appeared in ''[[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]'' #37 (April 1981).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
While Sean Cassidy was working on a deep undercover mission for [[Interpol]], his wife Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa, at Cassidy Keep, County Mayo, Ireland. Not much later, Maeve died in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean, his cousin [[Black Tom Cassidy|Tom]] took care of Theresa. When Sean returned to learn of his wife's death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

Tom (now known as [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]]) would raise Theresa as his apprentice in his criminal activities. While still a young teen, Theresa accompanied Black Tom and his then-partner, the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] to assist him in his crimes. Here, employing the name Siryn, she aided them in a theft of [[vibranium]], and battled the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and several of the X-Men.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37 Marvel Comics.</ref> This conflict ended in Black Tom's temporary capture. While in custody, Black Tom exonerated Theresa of responsibility for her crimes and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38 Marvel Comics.</ref> The X-Men brought Theresa back to their headquarters, where she was joyfully reunited with her father.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]]. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #148 Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Muir Island===
Theresa soon moved to [[Muir Island]], home of the research laboratories of [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], a longtime ally of [[Professor X]]avier.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During an overnight visit to Xavier Institute, Siryn, [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Illyana Rasputin]], and a young Muir Island resident named Amp battled robotic duplicates of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] after accidentally releasing them from the [[Danger Room]]. Later in the evening, Siryn engaged Kitty in a vicious fist fight after Amp convinced her that the young X-Man was trying to sabotage her chances with a young man named Dmitri. After the fight was broken up by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], the girls reconciled and left on friendly terms.<ref>[[Van Lente, Fred]]. ''Wolverine: First Class'' #6 Marvel Comics.</ref> She also accompanied Wolverine and Kitty when they were asked by Professor Xavier to act as bodyguards for the mutant pop-star [[Dazzler]]. Dazzler was so impressed with Theresa's rendition of ''[[Amazing Grace]]'', that she asked the young mutant to act as a [[backing vocalist]] for her concert.<ref>[[David, Peter]]. ''Wolverine: First Class'' #16 Marvel Comics.</ref>

While living back on the island, Siryn started a romantic relationship with the mutant known as [[Jamie Madrox]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  This version of Multiple Man turned out to be one of his many duplicates and not the original Multiple Man, leading to the end of the relationship.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  During this time Siryn and Multiple Man traveled to [[New York City]].<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #1 Marvel Comics.</ref> She and Madrox began a search to help the [[New Mutants]] find two of their members, [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], who had run away from the school.<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #2 Marvel Comics.</ref>  In the course of this adventure, Siryn and Multiple Man found Sunspot and met the association of street-level mutants known as the [[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]].<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #3 Marvel Comics.</ref> They were transported, with the Fallen Angels, to [[Devil Dinosaur]]'s planet.<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #4</ref> They then traveled to the "Coconut Grove", the home planet of the alien [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]].<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #6 Marvel Comics.</ref> While there, her superhuman powers were neutralized, and she was made a captive by Unipar of the "Coconut Grove" planet.<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #7 Marvel Comics.</ref> She regained her superhuman powers and freedom, and returned to Earth. She decided to remain in the Fallen Angels for a time to help reform their criminal members.<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #8 Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, back on Muir Island, she fell under the mental control of the [[Shadow King]].<ref>Claremont, Chris. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #278 Marvel Comics.</ref> Before long, she was freed from the Shadow King's control.<ref>Claremont, Chris. ''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref>

===X-Force===
{{Refimprove|section|date=April 2009}}
[[Image:Deadpool3-56.PNG|right|thumb|200px|Deadpool and Siryn, by [[Karl Kerschl]]]]
Siryn becomes a core member of [[X-Force]], a [[paramilitary]] superhero team and for a time was its field leader. As a member of X-Force, her teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] develops a romantic interest in her while Siryn begins an on-going flirtation with the mercenary [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]. Deadpool and Siryn initially became involved when the two met while fighting Black Tom Cassidy and the Juggernaut. Though Banshee warns Siryn that Deadpool was a madman and a murderer, she found herself quite taken with him, even looking past his horrific appearance. Due to this kindness, Deadpool becomes infatuated with Siryn and often sat outside her window as she slept in the X-Mansion. At first Siryn is unaware of this, but she is comforted in knowing that he is watching over her. Over time, Siryn became the voice of reason and sanity in Deadpool's ear, attempting to sway him to the side of good. She assists him in some of his missions, such as when Deadpool felt he needed some blood from the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in order to cure problems with his own healing powers. In the end, however, Siryn becomes overwhelmed with balancing her duties with X-Force and the demands of Deadpool's somewhat faulty sanity. She promises him that she would consider progressing their relationship if he continues on the path of good, and once she has her X-Force responsibilities secured. Warpath continues to seek Siryn's affections, and makes his dislike for Deadpool clear during a visit to the baseball diamond used in the movie, ''[[Field of Dreams]]''.<ref>''Deadpool'' v3 #12</ref>

Siryn confronts varied adversaries during her time in X-Force. She helps put down a coup in the other dimensional realm of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]]. She confronts the forces of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and the interdimensional media mogul known as [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. She even battles [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces on more than one occasion. She also confronts more down to earth problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. Warpath helps her to cope with her drinking problems, and as of recent issues of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] she is leading a sober lifestyle.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She becomes a vital part of the team, as opined by an aspect of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]],<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' #68</ref> which saves the entire team from a near-death experience.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She leaves when [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], a former teammate turned villain, slashes her throat, destroying her vocal cords and rendering her temporarily [[speech disorder|mute]] and powerless.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===X-Corporation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
Thanks to the aid of Deadpool, Siryn has since fully healed from her vocal cord injuries. Deadpool tracked down [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and stole a sample of his blood to heal her. 

Siryn joins the [[Paris]] branch of the international mutant task force [[X-Corporation]], where she reunites with old friends such as Multiple Man, [[Rictor]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], and works for the first time with [[M (comics)|M]]. Their first mission does not go well and Siryn has to deal with the loss of another friend, [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]].<ref>"New X-Men" (vol. 1) #130 (Oct 2002), Marvel Comics</ref>

===X-Factor Investigations===
{{Refimprove|section|date=April 2009}}
Siryn leaves X-Corp to become a member of [[X-Factor Investigations]]. Siryn, as part of her initial duties for X-Factor Investigations, investigates the murder of a woman who died in a movie star's penthouse, on behalf of the victim's sister. A rival firm, Singularity Investigations, represented the actor with [[Damian Tryp]], Jr. as the defense counsel and to prove the star innocent. When Siryn and X-Factor Investigations manages to incriminate the star, and to thwart SI’s assassination attempt on [[Rictor]],<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #3-4; [[Marvel Comics]]. March - April 2006</ref> Tryp Junior is so infuriated that he ambushes Siryn and beats her, leaving her to die in an alley. She was later rescued by Rictor. 

Siryn was in a state of [[denial]] regarding her father's [[X-Men: Deadly Genesis|death]], holding to the fact that many X-Men have been believed dead only to later [[comic book death|return alive]].

Due to a love triangle with fellow teammates Multiple Man and [[M (comics)|Monet St. Croix]], Siryn's relationships with the X-Factor members are strained.  During a night of drinking on Jamie Madrox's part, Siryn ends up sleeping with Madrox, and St. Croix with his dupe. Both women are unaware that this had occurred, and are both hopeful of continuing a romantic relationship with him. Upon reabsorbing his dupe, Madrox is reluctant to tell the ladies, fearing for his life.  Siryn resolves her differences with both Madrox and St. Croix, and the two women develop a budding friendship and partnership on later missions.

Theresa and Monet are sent to retrieve two famous child singers (who specialize in mutant hate songs) from their parents, thanks to a court order from their grandparents. The two end up being ambushed, knocked out, and kidnapped by the children's mutant bodyguards, [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]] and Clay.  They awake imprisoned, (Theresa is tied up with her mouth covered by duct tape to prevent her from using her powers), but they both escape and return the children to their grandparents. It is revealed that the entire mission was a ruse by [[Isolationist (comics)|Josef Huber]] to lure the women away from their X-Factor teammates. Both Monet and Siryn's mental-based powers negatively affect Huber's mind-control abilities.

==="World War Hulk"===
Siryn answers the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]' call for help when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] assaults the [[X-Mansion]] in "[[World War Hulk]]".{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Messiah Complex===
Theresa assists Rictor's infiltration of the [[Purifiers]], and accompanies M and [[Strong Guy]], along with the rest of the X-Men, to rescue the mutant baby and X-Force. She later receives a call from the mutant [[Peepers]], who is being pursued by [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]], but Theresa arrives too late to help him and finds what is left of his corpse. Siryn prays at the comatose Jamie's bedside when he awakes, and takes part in the X-Men's assault on the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]' base with Monet and Guido, taking on [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] in the battle.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Divided We Stand===
Siryn reveals that she is pregnant with Jamie's child, and after talking with Monet she reveals she intends on keeping it. She has not yet told Jamie but when she tries, he mistakenly believes that she wants to quit X-Factor. Monet later makes Siryn realize that she still loves Jamie. Theresa then tries to tell Jamie again but [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]] makes his presence known in Mutant Town so X-Factor split up to deal with him and help the residents.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Sean===
In ''X-Factor'' #10, [[Jamie Madrox]] awakes to learn that he and one of his duplicates slept with Theresa and [[Monet St. Croix|Monet]].<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #10 Marvel Comics.  (October 2006)</ref> Although he is initially uncertain as to which was which,<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #13 Marvel Comics (January 2007)</ref> he comes to conclude with near certainty that it was he that slept with Theresa, and the dupe that slept with Monet, though this does little to assuage Theresa and Monet's anger.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #14 Marvel Comics. (February 2007)</ref> Theresa later discovers that she is pregnant,<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #28 Marvel Comics. (April 2008)</ref> and Jamie eventually learns about this.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #32 Marvel Comics. (August 2008)</ref> In ''X-Factor'' #39, Theresa goes into labor. In the midst of it, she proposes to Jamie, who accepts. She gives birth to a boy, and they name him Sean, after her father, whose death she finally accepts. Just hours after his birth, however, Sean, much to the horror of Jamie, Theresa and X-Factor, is absorbed into Jamie's body as Jamie holds him, completely against Jamie's will. Jamie later says that Sean was an "infant dupe", and absorbed into him as a dupe would, but a grieving Theresa is only filled with rage toward Jamie.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #39 Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Assuming leadership and departure===
After the pregnancy, Madrox leaves the team and Terry takes charge, though she sinks into sadness because of the recent events.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #41 Marvel Comics.</ref> Following Madrox's return to present time, he offers to leave the team headquarters in [[Detroit]] and restart a branch with Guido in New York. She disbands the Detroit team, bringing most of the members to return the New York branch. She runs into Madrox's reverend dupe who helps her cope with her depression and has a one-night stand with her former boyfriend Deadpool.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #200 Marvel Comics.</ref> After coming to terms with his death and reconciling her grief, Siryn has taken her deceased father's codename as her own and begins calling herself Banshee in honor of his memory.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' #204 Marvel Comics.</ref>
During the events of ''[[X-Men: Second Coming]]'', it is revealed that agents of the Mutant Response Division are preparing to target Siryn for assassination.<ref>''X-Factor'' #204 Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Siryn is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses sonic powers similar to those of her father, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], although she is able to use her powers in ways that Banshee apparently cannot.  Like her father, she has the ability to emit high-decibel "sonic screams" to create various sonic effects with her vocal cords. She can also vary the pitch to deflect [[projectile]]s, and she even used it to deflect lasers once.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She possesses an enhanced sense of hearing and can use her voice for [[List of comic book superpowers#Echolocation|echolocation]] to detect objects. While screaming, Siryn is able to fly at the speed of sound. Siryn has especially potent sonic attacks. She can shatter objects; project concussive blasts of sonic force (a "sonic lance"); or cause immediate pain, nausea/vomiting, and unconsciousness. She has shown a degree of resistance to what would be harmful and painful sounds and vibrations to normal humans or mutants without sonic-based powers.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #30 Marvel Comics.</ref> She also possesses psionic powers to create a force field that protects her against her own sonic vibrations to assist her ability to fly, and to help direct her sonic powers.

She is vulnerable to losing the ability to use her power effectively by overstraining and overusing her sonic screams or injury to her throat and [[vocal folds|vocal chords]].<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #90 Marvel Comics.</ref> She also lacks fine control of her abilities when in extreme distress: screaming in pain during her pregnancy, she unwillingly shattered every window in the complex, causing the medical staff to writhe in agony.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor #39 Marvel Comics. (2009)</ref>

Unlike her father, Siryn is able to influence and control other human beings with her sonics, as well as cause them to enter a [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] state. Siryn can also cause the intended person to fall in love with her without regard to gender or sexual orientation and carry out her wishes and commands, like mythical [[Siren]]s.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #1; Marvel Comics. January 2006</ref> Siryn once utilized this ability on [[Spider-Man]], forcing him to divulge the truth about the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] of the mutants.<ref>David, Peter. ''X-Factor'' (vol. 3) #8; Marvel Comics. August 2006</ref>

In addition, she can also prevent others from hearing external sounds by a certain vocal pitch so that she can secretly deliver messages to them.<ref>''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' #17 Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
Theresa first appears as a human in the X-Man arc of the AOA crossover. She alerts [[Nate Grey]] to an incoming attack by calling out to him, in doing so, activating her latent mutant abilities. She then accompanies him and his crew for the rest of the arc, culminating in X-Man being shunted into the 616 reality. In the AOA reality, Theresa did not go by the Siryn codename, instead going by Sonique.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

==In other media==
===Films===
[[Image:Shaunak.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Shauna Kain as Siryn in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.]]
In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', Siryn was played by [[Shauna Kain]] in a small cameo role.  During [[William Stryker]]'s attack on the mansion, her scream alerts the rest of the school that they are under attack. She was knocked out, but was rescued by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Her name (along with her father's) also appears on a list of names [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for Magneto's file.  In the [[Chris Claremont]]'s novelization for the film, Siryn and a young [[Jamie Madrox]] are involved in a budding teen romance. Kain reprised the role in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.
