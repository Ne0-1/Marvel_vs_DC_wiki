'''Isamot Kol''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] from the planet [[Thanagar]], and a member of the intergalactic police force known as the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. He first appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' # 1 (November 2005), and was created by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], and artist [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]]. He was named after editor Peter Tomasi, in that "Isamot" is "Tomasi" spelled backwards.

==Character history==
Kol is a Lizarkon (a [[humanoid]] [[lizard]] belonging to one of the many different species who inhabit Thanagar) and a veteran soldier of the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. A member of the Imperial Thanagarian Army, Kol was scheduled to be executed for killing his commanding officer because his superior wanted to surrender to a squadron of [[Rann]]ians. Kol explained that he hates cowards, and that after killing his superior, he and the rest of his squad defeated the Rannians, and that his fellow soldiers attempted to report the superior’s death as an accident, but Kol, who personally held truth as a guiding principle, refused to lie.

At the exact moment before he was [[behead]]ed, however, he was saved by a Green Lantern power ring, the powerful weapon assigned to each member of the Green Lantern Corps. The Corps was in the process of recruiting 7,200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. The rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer, and thus the ring, which includes a [[Sentience|sentient]] computer, freed Kol from his bonds, and allowed him to escape his captors. He was brought for Green Lantern training to the planet Oa, home to the extraterrestrial [[Guardians of the Universe]], who administrate and oversee the Corps.

Kol was given a temporary badge and partnered with fellow new recruit [[Vath Sarn]], a Rannian who was also plucked from the war. In contrast to Sarn’s discipline and adaptability, Kol still saw Sarn as an enemy from the war, and instigated conflict with him as they began their first assignment, diverting ships away from Star 38, which, like several recent stars, had begun to show signs of instability. Kol was also slow to adapt to Corps protocols, questioning his orders, and even threatening an Okaaran hospital ship that fired upon him after refusing to change course from the star. The star eventually went [[supernova]], and the two new recruits valiantly attempted to pull the ship from the ensuing black hole, but were sucked in. They were eventually saved by GL trainer [[Kilowog]]. Isamot and Vath personally learn of the plans of the Spider Guild, a group of humanoid [[arachnids]] from the [[Vega]] star system that were planning to attack Oa. The group of Lanterns, many on low power, were forced to fight the Guild on multiple occasions. They also faced the threat of mercenary forces who wish to slay Latnerns for money. Isamot had a slight problem with [[Soranik Natu]], a rookie companion in the battle, regarding her as a traitor because she left the Lanterns willingly. This did not stop him from fully participating in the battle and working with Natu when needed. The GL's return to Oa, where they successfully repelled the attack.

===Thanagar Problems===

Even if he warmed to Vath, he has currently decided to reduce his serving time for the Green Lantern Corps, due to the mating urges (akin to a [[Pon Farr]]) he had matured as a member of his species. Announced to want serve back again on Thanagar for a while, living with his intended mate Qaylyra, another saurian.

Unfortunately, [[Citadel (comics)|Citadel]] forces, alleged allies of Rann, attack Thanagar just as Isamot's mate enters her only receptive mating period (''Green Lantern Corps'' #4 Nov. 2006). Isamot then must choose between his partner and the only possibillity of a family.
