'''Isamot Kol''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] from the planet [[Thanagar]], and a member of the intergalactic police force known as the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. He first appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' # 1 (November 2005), and was created by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], and artist [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]]. He was named after editor Peter Tomasi, in that "Isamot" is "Tomasi" spelled backwards.

==Fictional character history==
Kol is a Lizarkon (a [[humanoid]] [[lizard]] belonging to one of the many different species who inhabit Thanagar) and a veteran soldier of the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. A member of the Imperial Thanagarian Army, Kol was scheduled to be executed for killing his commanding officer because his superior wanted to surrender to a squadron of [[Rann]]ians. Kol explains to a fellow prisoner that he hates cowards, and that after killing his superior, he and the rest of his squad defeated the Rannians, and that his fellow soldiers attempted to report the superior’s death as an accident, but Kol, who personally held truth as a guiding principle, refused to lie.

At the exact moment before he was to be [[behead]]ed, however, he is saved by a Green Lantern power ring, the powerful weapon assigned to each member of the Green Lantern Corps.<ref>"Green Lantern Corps Recharge" #1</ref> The Corps was in the process of recruiting 7,200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. The rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer, and thus the ring, which includes a [[Sentience|sentient]] computer, frees Kol from his bonds, and allows him to escape his captors. His fellow prisoner begs to be taken with but Kol refuses, believing the man to have actually earned his fate. 

Kol is brought to the planet Oa, home to the extraterrestrial [[Guardians of the Universe]] who administer and oversee the Corps, for Green Lantern training .

===Spider Guild===

Kol is given a temporary badge and partnered with fellow new recruit [[Vath Sarn]], a Rannian who was also plucked from the war. In contrast to Sarn’s discipline and adaptability, Kol still saw Sarn as an enemy from the war, and instigated conflict with him as they began their first assignment. This was diverting ships away from Star 38, which, like several recent stars, had begun to show signs of instability. Kol was also slow to adapt to Corps protocols, questioning his orders, and even threatening an Okaaran hospital ship that fired upon him after refusing to change course from the star. The star eventually went [[supernova]], and the two new recruits valiantly attempted to pull the ship from the ensuing black hole, but were sucked in. This was part of a planned attack by the Spider Guild, operating out from the forbidden Vegan system.

They are discovered by the GL trainer [[Kilowog]], who had broken Lantern rules to find them. Isamot and Sarn, forced to go on by themselves due to Kilowog not being able to fit in the tunnels they were using, find out the Guild's plans to invade [[Oa]].

The Guild detect them and attack. The three join up with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] and [[Kyle Rayner]], who had also broken the rules to rescue the missing and unwilling GL recruit [[Soranik Natu]]. Soranik's unwillingness to be a Lantern causes Kol to perceive her as a traitor. Despite this and other conflicts, the six Lanterns successfully make it back to Oa.<ref>"Green Lantern Corps Recharge" #4</ref> They help in driving off the invasion of Guild forces.

===Thanagar problems===

Isamot decides to reduce his serving time from the Green Lantern Corps, due to the mating urges (akin to a [[Pon farr]]) he had matured as a member of his species. He announced his desire to serve back again on Thanagar for a while, living with his intended mate Qaylyra, another saurian.

Unfortunately, [[Citadel (comics)|Citadel]] forces, alleged allies of Rann, attack Thanagar just as Isamot's mate enters her only receptive mating period.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' #4 Nov. 2006</ref> Isamot then must choose between his partner and the only possibility of a family. He chose his partner but by the time he returned she had taken another mate.  With the mating urges over he returns to full duty.

Isamot fights alongside Vath during the [[Sinestro Corps War]]. Later, he is forcibly pulled to Oa to take part in a treaty-breaking incursion into the depths of Okarran space, along with other Green Lanterns. The very act of being taken to Oa causes him to disrupt Thanagar flying police officers, who scoff and insult the very concept of a 'downsider' Green Lantern. 

Isamot is part of a Green Lantern force sent to the time-ravaged Earth.<ref>"Final Crisis" #5</ref>

===Blackest Night===
