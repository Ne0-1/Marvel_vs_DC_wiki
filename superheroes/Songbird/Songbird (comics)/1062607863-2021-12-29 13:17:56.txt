{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The character first appeared as Screaming Mimi in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #54 (August, 1979), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]], and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=338}}</ref>

She made numerous appearances as a supervillain before taking on a new role as a superhero in the ''Thunderbolts'' series.

After some time away from the team, she returned as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' beginning with issue #144, and appeared as a supporting character when the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175.

In June 2015, Songbird was announced as a team member in the relaunched ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'', part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]" branding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/all-new-all-different-marvel-your-guide-to-the-avengers-team-books/ |title=All New, All Different Marvel: Your Guide to the Avengers Team Books |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706194604/http://comicsalliance.com/all-new-all-different-marvel-your-guide-to-the-avengers-team-books/ |archive-date=2015-07-06 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Melissa Gold was a troubled runaway from an alcoholic father and incarcerated mother. In order to survive on the streets, Melissa developed a hard edge to her personality, referring to herself as "Mimi".<ref>''Thunderbolts: Distant Rumblings'' one-shot. Marvel Comics.</ref> She was eventually imprisoned, where she met [[Poundcakes]], a female wrestler who invited her to join the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]] under the name Screaming Mimi, alongside [[Lascivious (comics)|Titania]] and [[Letha (comics)|Letha]].<ref name=autogenerated1>''Thunderbolts'' #21</ref> The Grapplers became renowned for their colorful personalities and ringside antics, but the wrestling federation denied them the opportunity to make the amount of money their male counterparts made. Instead, the group agreed to earn supplementary income by performing a covert operation for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]]. Roxxon gave the Grapplers special paraphernalia to assist them in their mission; Mimi received an apparatus that converted her voice to high-frequency sonics for various effects.<ref name=autogenerated1/> The Grapplers tested these powers by fighting [[Thundra]] in a wrestling ring.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> On their mission, Thundra led them into [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Project Pegasus|Project Pegasus]] to smuggle in the Nth Projector for Roxxon. The mission failed when they were defeated by the heroes [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] and [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Grapplers were tried and jailed for their misdeeds. Alongside the Grapplers, she victimized [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] while she was in [[Ryker's Island]] prison with them.<ref>''Dazzler'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Grapplers were finally paroled, they discovered that the women's wrestling movement had lost its momentum without them, so they continued to perform crimes to support themselves and working as professional criminals. Alongside the Grapplers, Mimi attempted to attack the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] while he was in the hospital, and battled [[Captain America]].<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #96. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, the Grapplers set their sights on a women's division of the superpowered [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]]. Their manager, [[Auntie Freeze]], arranged for the women to augment their natural abilities with artificial powers created by the agency Power Broker, Inc.  While the other Grapplers received superhuman strength, Mimi instead had her vocal enhancements internalized as a throat implant.<ref name=autogenerated1/> (It was believed that Mimi had also gained superhuman strength, however by her own account to [[Abner Jenkins|Mach-1]] it was only the other Grapplers that were augmented.<ref name=autogenerated1/>) The all-new Grapplers made a legitimate professional comeback that proved short-lived. When [[Titania (Grapplers)|Titania]] was murdered by the vigilante [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]], Mimi was among the female wrestlers of the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation who participated in a mass attack upon the Thing, blaming him for Titania's death.<ref>''Thing'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> After [[Letha (comics)|Letha]] was later also killed by Scourge,<ref>''Captain America'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref> the Grapplers broke up.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Mimi was later contacted by the criminal [[Baron Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join his version of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Her first assignment was to help bust the female [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]] out of prison, but Mimi was captured in the subsequent battle with the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. She was bound and gagged and arrested.<ref>''Avengers'' #271. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, she formed a romantic and criminal partnership with the similarly-empowered [[Angar the Screamer]], at one point battling the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. The pair impersonated Hawkeye and Mockingbird, but battled them and were defeated.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mimi was also seen among the various female superhumans aboard [[Superia]]'s cruiseship, where she battled Captain America and Paladin.<ref>''Captain America'' #389-390. Marvel Comics.</ref> Angar was eventually mortally wounded by a gunshot during a robbery attempt that went sour, and died in Mimi's arms after they escaped. Mad with grief, Mimi screamed, burning out her power. Immediately afterward, she was contacted by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] once more, and she accepted his offer to join a formative Masters of Evil. Zemo allowed Mimi to be nursed back to health, and his accomplice, the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], gave her new powers via a voice-augmenting harness and high-tech implants in her neck based on technology from the villain [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]]. With her newly transformed powers, she resumed the use of her given name Melissa, and adopted the identity of Songbird as a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a new Masters of Evil group posing as superheroes to win the world's trust while secretly plotting world conquest under Zemo's direction.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Thunderbolts'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Melissa and most of the other Thunderbolts grew to like their heroic roles. In particular, Melissa began to truly grow into her own and even began a romance with her teammate [[Abner Jenkins]], alias MACH-1, formerly the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]]. Ultimately, the Thunderbolts turned against Zemo, foiling his attempt at world domination and rescuing the Avengers in the process. Melissa continued to serve with the team, who operated as a team of outlaw superheroes.

Melissa stayed with the Thunderbolts through different incarnations after this, and rose to second-in-command under Hawkeye and eventually ran the team herself.  Her sonic equipment was replaced several times, both by criminal organizations and by S.H.I.E.L.D.

During the superhero "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" event the Thunderbolts, including Melissa, were approached by the government to catch supervillains and rehabilitate them.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Having turned up alive after his apparent death, [[Lemuel Dorcas]] developed an obsession for Songbird where he kidnapped her and repaired her vocal cords as he intends to make Songbird his slave. However, Songbird was able to escape from Doctor Dorcas's clutches, as with the surgery restoring her persuasive powers as well, she turned Doctor Dorcas's henchmen against him.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #171. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Secret Invasion]]" event, Songbird was attacked by a [[Skrull]] who not only had her powers, but also had the powers of [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] and the rest of the original Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Thunderbolts save her by causing this Skrull to merge into a nearby building, killing him.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" event, [[Norman Osborn]] orders Melissa killed by other members of the Thunderbolts team, forcing her to go into hiding for a time.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #126. Marvel Comics.</ref> She gathers allies to resist Osborn.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #134. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" event and Osborn's subsequent downfall, Songbird has taken a position at "the Raft", as the prison's female warden. Songbird has joined the new Thunderbolts team, led by [[Luke Cage]] in large part to keep a close eye over Moonstone (whom Cage has offered a chance for freedom in exchange for her serving on the team). When Songbird objects to Moonstone's inclusion on the team due to her history of manipulation and deceit, Cage counters that Songbird herself used to be regarded the same way and that she should give Moonstone the same chances she was given by others.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Screaming Mimi, Gold's enhanced vocal cords were bionically altered and enhanced by technicians in the employ of Roxxon. As such, she had the ability to generate a high-pitched, earsplitting, earth-shattering supersonic scream of great volume and for a variety of effects. She was capable of emitting a sound equivalent in decibels to the noise of a jet engine passing 5 feet from one's ear. She has perfect pitch, the ability to hear in her mind the correct frequency for every musical note on the scale. Every note on the scale she screams induces a different effect upon those who hear it. Low C causes low-level anxiety and shortness of breath, D causes high-level anxiety and panic attacks, E causes dizziness and vertigo, F causes nausea and stomach cramping, G causes severe headaches and fatigue, A causes blindness, B causes euphoria and eventual stupor, and high C causes the listener to visually hallucinate. By rapid oscillation between two notes, she can combine effects. In addition, she could produce certain vocal effects in harmony with Angar the Screamer, such as specific sustained illusions. Her nervous system is immune to her own vocal powers. At the upper limit of her scream's power, it could actually damage physical objects.  Faced with the death of her lover, [[Angar the Screamer]], she screamed for 43 minutes in a fit of hysteria, creating a large blast crater and literally liquefying nearby plant life.<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997''. Marvel Comics.</ref> This outburst nearly destroyed her vocal cords, and depowered her briefly until she used new technology to assume the Songbird alias.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> During a later encounter with the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], Songbird unintentionally reactivated her incredibly strong supersonic scream ability.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #149. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As Songbird, Melissa uses a derivation of technology created by the criminal Ulysses Klaw that converts sound into a malleable form of energy that has physical form and mass, termed "solid sound". She could initially create simple 3-dimensional sound/mass constructions, though as she has gained experience in her new supersonic sound abilities, she has learned to create more complex forms. She shapes and animates these by mental command and they only remain in existence for as long as she wills them to. She can "fly" by generating solid sound "wings" attached to her body; initially, these were created as glider-style wings, stretching from wrists to feet, though more recently they are shown attached to her back.  Presumably, she animates the wings to flap or somehow generates a propulsive force with her powers, since her airborne speed and maneuverability to date extend well beyond simple gliding.

Songbird has also occasionally exhibited an ability to influence others through sub-vocal (below the level of conscious human hearing) sonics; this is more of a subtle "nudge" or subconscious suggestion rather than outright mind control. This is apparently an effect generated by the remnants of her original sonic enhancements.

As a former wrestler, she is extensively skilled in hand-to-hand combat using wrestling techniques and was well trained by Titania.
