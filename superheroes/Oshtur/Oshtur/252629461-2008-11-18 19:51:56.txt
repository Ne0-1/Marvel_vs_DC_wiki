'''Oshtur''' is a fictional character published in [[Marvel Comics]].  The character is depicted as an [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Goddess]] born from the demiurge sometime billions of years ago.  Unlike her siblings, Oshtur had a fascination with the realms beyond Earth.  She took to the heavens before the fall of the Elder Gods and their degeneration into malevolent demons.  It is unknown for how long Oshtur left earth, but it is presumed to be millions of years.  While exploring the universe, she met a companion in [[Hoggoth]], one of the founders of the later [[Vishanti]].  Again, it is not known when or where Oshtur and Hoggoth discovered each other.

==Publication history==
The character appears in ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #43 (July 1992), #48-49 (December 1992-January 1993), and #54 (June 1993).

Oshtur appeared as part of the "Vishanti" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #8.

==Birth of Agamotto & the Vishanti==
After witnessing children play, Oshtur was moved and gave birth to [[Agamotto]]. She instructed Agamotto then left him to undertake the paths of magic. 

With Agamotto and Hoggoth, she formed the Vishanti.

Oshtur is also responsible for creating the Tome of Oshtur and the Book of the Vishanti.

==The Book of the Vishanti==
Oshtur is credited as the creator of the [[Book of the Vishanti]], a tome of untold power comparable to the Darkhold, but based in white magic.
