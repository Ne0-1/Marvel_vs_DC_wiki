'''Oshtur''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|ʃ|t|ər}}) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

The character is depicted as an [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Goddess]] born from the [[Demiurge]] sometime billions of years ago.  Unlike her siblings, Oshtur had a fascination with the realms beyond Earth.  She took to the heavens before the fall of the Elder Gods and their degeneration into malevolent demons.  It is unknown for how long Oshtur left earth, but it is presumed to be millions of years.  While exploring the universe and other planes of existence, she met a companion in the mysterious but immensely powerful mystical entity [[Hoggoth]], one of the founders of the later [[Vishanti]].  Again, it is unclear when or where Oshtur and Hoggoth discovered each other, though it has been confirmed that Oshtur asexually spawned Agamotto from one of her tears.

==Publication history==
The character appears in ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #43 (July 1992), #48-49 (December 1992-January 1993), and #54 (June 1993). She plays a significant part in the four-part series ''Mystic Arcana'' (2008).

Oshtur appeared as part of the "Vishanti" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #8.

==Birth of Agamotto and the Vishanti==
After witnessing children play, Oshtur was moved and gave birth to [[Agamotto]]. She instructed Agamotto then left him to undertake the paths of magic.<ref>Mystic Arcana: The Marvel Tarot (focusing on Ian McNee with various Marvel archetypal characters appearing as Tarot Cards and some background stories on principalities.) Writer/Artist David Sexton with Doug Sexton and Jeff Christiansen.</ref>

With Agamotto and Hoggoth, she formed the Vishanti.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Oshtur is also responsible for creating the Tome of Oshtur and the Book of the Vishanti.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

==The Book of the Vishanti==
Oshtur is credited as the creator of the [[Book of the Vishanti]], a tome of untold power comparable to the Darkhold, but based in white magic.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

In ''[[Mystic Arcana]]'', Ian McNee has a vision of Oshtur in which he is assigned to find the Four Cornerstones of Creation. In the final book he learns that this was a deception by [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], and the real Oshtur intercedes. In Book I, McNee claims [[Ma'at]] and [[Ishtar]] as names Oshtur is known by. Additionally, in ''Marvel Tarot'', Oshtur is hinted to be some kind of angelic being set as an opposite to the evil of the demonic [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], and has also been implied to have some undefined connection with the Judeo-Christian [[God]] and the [[Virgin Mary]], along with many other ancient human mythologies and pantheons.
