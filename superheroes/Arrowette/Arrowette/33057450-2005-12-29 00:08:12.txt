'''Arrowette''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]]. 

The first Arrowette, more correctly known as '''Miss Arrowette''', was a would-be [[sidekick]] and general nuisance to [[Green Arrow]].  However, Bonnie King's career as a crime-fighter was short-lived, due to [[carpal tunnel]] syndrome which limited her abilities.  She married Bernell Jones and quietly dropped her crime-fighting activities.

Bernell and Bonnie had a daughter, Cissie King-Jones, before Bernell died of food poisoning.  After Bernell's death, Bonnie became the [[superhero]]ic equivalent of a 'stage mother', driving her daughter to practice [[archery]] and adopt a version of her old costume, becoming the second Arrowette.

Arrowette first appeared in the pages of ''Impulse'' wearing a frilly costume and a bejeweled mask that aped her mother's old costume.  Despite Arrowette's success as a heroine, [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'s mentor, [[Max Mercury]], was concerned by what he saw as Bonnie's exploitation of her daughter.  Welfare Services got involved, and Bonnie lost custody of her daugher, who was sent to Elias School for Girls, a [[boarding school]].

Arrowette next appeared in the pages of [[Young Justice]] wearing a much more practical costume.  Acting alone, she battled the villainous Harm and was injured by him with one of her own arrows.  However, she managed to escape and contact Young Justice, later joining the team, along with the second [[Wonder Girl]], [[Wonder Girl#Cassie Sandsmark|Cassie Sandsmark]], and [[Secret (comics)|Secret]], Greta.  The three quickly become close friends.

After her school therapist - one of the few adults whom Cissie trusted - was brutally murdered, Cissie tracked down the killers in a violent rage.  She would have killed one of them herself, if [[Superboy]] hadn't caught the arrow, and was so shaken by the incident that she vowed never to be Arrowette again.

However, she remained close friends with Cassie and Greta, and eventually reconciled with her mother, who convinced her daughter to try out for the [[Olympic Games]].  With her battle-honed abilities, Cissie ended up taking home the gold, and became something of a celebrity, guest-starring on Superboy's favorite TV show, "''Wendy the Werewolf Stalker''" (a parody of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''), and frequently being asked for autographs.  She helped the [[Red Tornado]]'s daughter, Traya, adjust to life at Elias and later, when Secret was returned to humanity, Cissie helped to organise a placement for her at the same school.

She has never expressed any desire to return to her life as a superhero, but remains committed to justice and compassion.  During the [[Imperiex]] war, she served as medical aid volunteer, and more recently, she used her considerable clout (as an Olympic gold medalist) to get Cassie admitted to the Elias School for Girls.

The theory has been put forth by a large number of people that Arrowette's real father may in fact be Green Arrow himself, considering that her mother's husband conveniently died when she was so young. He may have been invented, or more likely, Bonnie King discovered she was pregnant and quickly dropped out of crime fighting, and hurried to find a husband so that the child would be considered his. This theory is consistent with Olliver Queen's behavior (she would hardly be his only illegitimate child) and with Cecilia's various features and other traits, such as her natural excellency with a bow and her propensity for challenging authority and having a difficult time fitting in with others. (Even the incident that prompted her to drop from superheroing vaguely parallels a time in Green Arrow's own life, where he became enraged enough to kill. Even Cissie's costume during this incident is similar to Olliver's during that time.) However, since the character has been largely shuffled out of any real interaction in the DCU, this theory will likely remain unconfirmed, and for the time being can only be regarded as [[fanon]].
