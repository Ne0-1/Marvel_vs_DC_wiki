Discovering that the amplification caused a build-up of energy in his body that is reaching a critical - and potentially fatal - level, the Laser seeks the aid of [[East German]] scientists, who offer to help by draining off the excess energy and using it to power a network of weapons [[satellite]]s. The plan, however, is stopped by Iron Man, and in battle with the hero the Laser's energy levels to build to critical mass.

==Powers and abilities==
A gifted research scientist with expertise in [[laser]] technology and a [[Ph.D]] in physics, Arthur Parks begins his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implants miniature laser [[diode]]s into his skin which absorb energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, [[light refraction]] for [[invisibility]] and [[illusion]] generation. 

Parks's material body is eventually replaced by photons due to an overloading of the diode implants. By increasing the [[density]] of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve "solidity"; project photons as energy beams and create [[three-dimensional]] [[holographic]] images. The character also possesses limited telepathic abilities and can [[Speed of light|travel at light speed]].

==Other versions==
The [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' features a story which the character reforms works at Stark Industries, with three different outcomes being presented.<ref>''What If?'' #63 (July 1994)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Living Laser appears in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' TV series voiced by [[Robert Hays]]. He is shown as a servant to the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] alongside [[MODOK]], [[Hypnotia]], [[Dreadknight]], [[Blacklash]], [[Grey Gargoyle]], [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]], and [[Justin Hammer]].
* Living Laser appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode "Meltdown" voiced by [[Louis Chirillo]]. Arthur Parks is a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] grunt who stole and became fascinated with an experimental vest during a raid on Stark International and ended up becoming Living Laser. Not only was he mistreated by some Maggia soldiers, he was also considered a disappointment by his mother. When he stole the experimental vest and attacked the city Iron Man had a hard time fighting him. Upon managing to match his weapons' energy frequency with Living Laser's body, Iron Man managed to disintegrate Living Laser. In "Fun with Lasers," he somehow ended up in a laser satellite owned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and discovered its power. Upon taking the operators on the satellite hostage, Living Laser demanded Iron Man to come to him despite the objections from [[Nick Fury]]. Iron Man managed to trap Living Laser in the satellite's laser-powered technological grid until he was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and placed in a special cell. In "Technovore," Tony Stark discovered that Living Laser is dying and argues with Nick Fury about it. In "Designed Only for Chaos," Living Laser's form is apparently falling apart. However Tony Stark volunteered to help cure the Laser. But then, the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] springs the Living Laser from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier against Laser's will so that A.I.M. can use him to help activate MODOK's harness. A.I.M. stole much of his power while activating [[MODOK]]. Iron Man invaded [[A.I.M.]] headquarters, but failed to stop MODOK's mobility harness from being activated. After usurping the role of being the leader of A.I.M. from the A.I.M Scientist-Supreme, MODOK attacked Iron Man. Soon, he was able to deduce that Iron Man was actually Tony Stark, much to the Laser's surprise. He then realizes that Iron Man actually wanted to help him, and joined the battle. After a rough fight, Living Laser used up the last of his power wiping MODOK's memory of Iron Man being Tony Stark. He then disappeared once again, this time permanently, knowing he actually did something good that day.
* Living Laser appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode "The Breakout" Pt. 1, voiced by [[Nolan North]]. He is shown as an inmate at the Vault when a mass breakout occurs.
