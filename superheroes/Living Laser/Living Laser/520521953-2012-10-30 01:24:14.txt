The Living Laser debuted in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #34 (Nov. 1966) as Arthur Parks, a scientist who created wrist-mounted laser units and a costume (writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated "Arthur Parks was a scientist sufficiently proficient to design laser projectors small enough to wear on his wrists, quite the achievement in 1966.")<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> 

Following his appearance in the following issue, the Living Laser resurfaced in ''Avengers King-Size Special'' #1 (Sept. 1967).

The Laser featured in the [[Acts of Vengeance]] storyline in ''Quasar'' #6 (Jan. 1990) and reappeared in a new [[photon]] form in ''Iron Man'' #259-263 (Aug.-Dec. 1990) before returning in ''Quasar'' #30 (Jan. 1992) and ''Iron Man'' #289 (Feb. 1993).

==Fictional character biography==
As the "Living Laser", Parks becomes a [[mercenary]] and professional criminal. He develops an infatuation with the heroine the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and after kidnapping her is forced to battle the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He captured Hawkeye and Captain America by placing them in a ring of lasers before leaving, but they were able to contact another member who helped them escape. The Living Laser met the Avengers again when he tried to conquer a small South American country, who defeat and incarcerate the villain.<ref>''Avengers'' #34-35 (Nov.- Dec. 1966)</ref>

The Laser, after breaking out of prison by creating a laser using parts teleported to him, reappears as part of a team formed by master villain the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] after being teleported to his base, in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the Avengers and conquer the world and attacked Africa to try taking diamonds, but was defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] despite the robot [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]] being transported there from a volcano.<ref>''Avengers King-Size Special'' #1 (Sept. 1967)</ref> and as part of "Batroc's Brigade" (consisting of the Laser; the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and [[Batroc the Leaper]]) in a battle against [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #105 (Sept. 1968)</ref> The Laser reappears as part of the first version of the [[Lethal Legion]] gathered by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] in a failed revenge attack on the Avengers<ref>''Avengers'' #78-79 (July-Aug. 1970)</ref> and has an encounter with [[Kree]] hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #35 (Nov. 1974)</ref>

The Laser eventually acquires the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Serpent Crown]], and while controlling the living weapon [[Nuklo]] and a [[battalion]] of the [[US Army]] attempts to conquer the world, but is defeated by the Avengers.<ref>'' Avengers'' #151 (Sept. 1976); #153 (Nov. 1976) & ''The Avengers Annual'' #6 (1976)</ref> He is then employed - along with fellow villains [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] - by [[Count Nefaria]], who temporarily amplifies their abilities and sends them against the Avengers as the second Lethal Legion. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria (who in "powered" mode battles the Avengers until defeated by the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]).<ref>''Avengers'' #164-166 (Nov. 1977 - Jan. 1978)</ref> 

Discovering that the amplification caused a build-up of energy in his body that is reaching a critical - and potentially fatal - level, the Laser seeks the aid of [[East German]] scientists, who offer to help by draining off the excess energy and using it to power a network of weapons [[satellite]]s. The plan, however, is stopped by Iron Man and in battle with the hero, the Laser's energy levels build to critical mass. Although the Laser begs for help, Iron Man has no choice but to hurl the character into the [[atmosphere]] where he [[detonate]]s and apparently dies.<ref>''Iron Man'' #152-153 (Nov.-Dec. 1981)</ref> Eventually revived, the Laser battles Iron Man once again;<ref>''Iron Man'' #211 (Oct. 1986)</ref> and during the    [[Acts of Vengeance]] storyline battles the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #6 (Jan. 1990)</ref>

The Laser reappears in a new [[photon]] form, posing as the deceased [[Titanium Man]] while taunting Iron Man. The villain is eventually defeated and banished to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #259 - 263 (Aug. - Dec. 1990)</ref> The villain eventually escapes,<ref>''Quasar'' #30 (Jan. 1992)</ref> and obtains a position at [[Stark Industries]]. [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] (a Stark employee and friend), however, is forced to trap the out of control Laser in a wide-beam communication chamber, which disperses him across the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #289 (Feb. 1993)</ref>

The Laser returns as an employee of the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM)]] villain [[MODOK]],<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up: MODOK's 11'' #1-5 (Sept. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref> and later as a member of a criminal army formed by the villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (Oct. 2007)</ref> The villain sides with the heroes during the [[Secret Invasion]] storyline in a pitched battle with the [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] [[Skrull]]s,<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1-8 (June 2008 - Jan. 2009)</ref> and has a number of encounters with various teams of Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' #46 (Dec. 2008); #50 (April 2009); ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25 & 27 (Aug. & Oct.); #61 (March 2010) & #63 (May 2010)</ref>

[[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Zeke Stane]] recruit Living Laser to join up with other Iron Man villains in a plot to defeat Iron Man. Upon receiving upgrades, Living Laser managed to break Tony Stark's repulsor arc causing him to go into cardiac arrest.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
A gifted research scientist with expertise in [[laser]] technology and a [[Ph.D]] in physics, Arthur Parks begins his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implants miniature laser [[diode]]s into his skin which absorb energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, [[light refraction]] for [[invisibility]] and [[illusion]] generation. 

Parks's material body is eventually replaced by photons due to an overloading of the diode implants. By increasing the [[density]] of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve "solidity"; project photons as energy beams and create [[three-dimensional]] [[holographic]] images. The character also possesses limited telepathic abilities and can [[Speed of light|travel at light speed]].
