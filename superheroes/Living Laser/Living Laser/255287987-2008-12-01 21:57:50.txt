The '''Living Laser''' ('''Arthur Parks''', alias the '''Laser''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The character first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #34 (Nov. 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Art Simek]] and [[Don Heck]].

==Publication history ==
The character of Arthur Parks first appears in ''Avengers'' #34-35 (Nov-Dec 1966), and is a relatively successful laser research scientist until spurned by a woman. Deciding he needed power to achieve his aims, Parks creates wrist-mounted laser units, a costume and uses the alias "Living Laser" as a mercenary and professional criminal. He then develops an infatuation with the heroine the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and after kidnapping her is forced to battle the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] while aiding [[Costa Verde]] guerillas. After being defeated by the Avengers, the Laser is sent to prison. 

The Laser then appears in ''Avengers'' King-Size Special #1 (Sep. 1967), and at the command of master villain the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] fights the Avengers alongside other supervillains as part of his attempt at world conquest. After a defeat, the Laser, together with team-mate the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], join [[Batroc the Leaper]] as part of the first "Batroc's Brigade" in a bid to kill [[Captain America]] in ''Captain America'' #105 (Sep. 1968). After being defeated again, the Laser later joins the first [[Lethal Legion]] and features in ''Avengers'' #78-79 (Jul. - Aug. 1970) in a failed revenge attack on the Avengers.  The Laser later battles the [[Kree]] hero [[Mar-Vell]] in ''Captain Marvel'' #35 (Nov. 1974), but after yet another defeat disappears into obscurity for some time. 

In '' Avengers'' #151 (Sep. 1976), #153 (Nov. 1976) and ''Avengers'' Annual #6 (1976) the Laser acquires the artifact the [[Serpent Crown]] and attempts to use the crown along with the living weapon [[Nuklo]] to conquer the world, but is defeated by once again by the Avengers. In ''Avengers'' #164 - 166 (Nov. 1977 - Jan. 1978) villain [[Count Nefaria]] employs the Laser and temporarily amplifies his abilities — together with those of team-mates [[Power Man]] and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] — before sending them against the Avengers as the second Lethal Legion. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria, who is subsequently defeated by the Avengers.  The character discovers in ''Iron Man'' #152 - 153 (Nov. - Dec. 1981) that the power build-up in his body is reaching critical - and potentially fatal - levels. The Laser seeks the aid of East German scientists, who offer to help by draining off the excess energy and using it to power a network of weapons satellites. This plan, however, is foiled by [[Iron Man]] who forces his energy levels to build to critical mass. The Laser begs for help, but with no time remaining Iron Man is forced to hurl him into the atmosphere where the Laser detonates and apparently dies. 

The Laser is eventually revived in ''Iron Man'' #211 (Oct. 1986) and later battles the cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] in ''Quasar'' #6 (Jan. 1990). The Laser eventually renews his vendetta against Iron Man and battles the hero across ''Iron Man'' #259 - 263 (Aug. - Dec. 1990), posing as the deceased [[Titanium Man]] to draw Iron Man out. Escaping again, the characters briefly enters an [[altermate universe]] in ''Quasar'' #30 (1992). With ''Iron Man'' #289 (Feb. 1993) the Laser reappears and encounters the hero [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]], who offers him a position at Stark Industries and a chance of reforming. The Laser accepts, but after a series of murders and mishaps is absorbed by Iron Man's armor and trapped in a long-term containment unit in ''Iron Man: The Inevitable'' #1 - 6 (2006).

After being tricked by the entity [[MODOK]] in ''MODOK's 11'' #5 (Jul. 2007), a freed Laser joins the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s criminal organisation. During a battle with the [[New Avengers]] in ''New Avengers'' #35 (Oct. 2007), he is defeated by [[sorcerer]] [[Doctor Strange]]. In the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''New Avengers'' #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
A gifted research scientist with expertise in [[laser]] technology and a [[Ph.D]] in physics, Arthur Parks began his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implanted miniature laser diodes into his skin which absorbed energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, light refraction for invisibility and illusion generation. 

Parks's material body was later replaced by photons due to an overloading of the Living Laser's diode implants. By increasing the density of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve "solidity"; project photons as energy beams and project three-dimensional holographic images. He also possesses limited telepathic abilities in his photon form and can communicate with others. In photon form, Parks can also [[Speed of light|travel at light speed]].

==Other versions==
===What If?===
''What If?'' #63 (July 1994) presents an [[Alternative universe (fan fiction)|alternate reality]] in which the Living Laser remains at Stark Industries, with three different outcomes to this choice being portrayed.
