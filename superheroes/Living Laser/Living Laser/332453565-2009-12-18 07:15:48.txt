==Powers and abilities==
A gifted research scientist with expertise in [[laser]] technology and a [[Ph.D]] in physics, Arthur Parks begins his criminal career using wrist-mounted laser projection units, and later implants miniature laser [[diode]]s into his skin which absorb energy. With the diode implants, Parks is capable of energy projection, [[light refraction]] for [[invisibility]] and [[illusion]] generation. 

Parks's material body is eventually replaced by photons due to an overloading of the diode implants. By increasing the [[density]] of the photons comprising his form, Parks can achieve "solidity"; project photons as energy beams and create [[three-dimensional]] [[holographic]] images. The character also possesses limited telepathic abilities and can [[Speed of light|travel at light speed]].
