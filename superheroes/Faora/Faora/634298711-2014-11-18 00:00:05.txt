'''Faora''' is the name of several female [[super-villains]] in [[DC Comics]] ''[[Superman]]'' titles.  All of them have some connection to Superman's home planet of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
The first Faora, '''Faora Hu-Ul''', was introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #471.<ref>''Action Comics'' #471 (May 1977)</ref>  She was a beautiful Kryptonian woman whose unexplained hatred for men led her to torture and kill 23 men at a secret concentration camp in her home.  For this, she was imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]] to complete a sentence of 300 Kryptonian years, the second longest term after [[Jax-Ur]].<ref name=ac472>''Action Comics'' #472 (June 1977)</ref><ref>''Phantom Zone'' #1 (January 1982)</ref> Ironically this allowed her to survive her homeworld's destruction, along with the other Phantom Zone prisoners, albeit in an invisible ghostlike form.  While imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, she was often depicted plotting against [[Superman]] with [[General Zod]] and Jax-Ur.  Her hatred of men was not limited to Kryptonians, as demonstrated by her pointless murder of a young Frenchman who was attracted by her beauty.<ref>''Phantom Zone'' #3 (March 1982)</ref>

Faora was an expert at the Kryptonian martial art of Horo-Kanu, which utilized the [[pressure points]] on the Kryptonian body.  This made her an extremely dangerous foe for Superman to face in hand-to-hand combat—he was forced to flee from their first encounter.<ref name=ac472 /> During one of her first appearances,<ref>''Action Comics'' #473 (July 1977)</ref> Faora could manifest some sort of "mental lightning" to physically attack other Kryptonians, but did not exhibit this additional power during later appearances.

===Post-Crisis===
====Pocket Universe====

Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], another Faora (renamed '''Zaora''') appeared in the [[Pocket universe|Pocket Universe]] created by the [[Time Trapper]], along with [[General Zod]] and [[Quex-Ul]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> The three tricked the [[Pocket universe|Pocket Universe]]'s [[Lex Luthor]] into releasing them from the [[Phantom Zone]]. After the Pocket Earth's population continued to resist their conquest of it, the three villains destroyed the atmosphere, killing almost all life.  Superman defeated them by permanently stripping the three of their super powers with [[Kryptonite#Variations|gold kryptonite]].  He then killed them with [[green kryptonite]] in punishment for their crimes, and to protect the real Earth, after they threatened to somehow regain their powers and destroy it as well.<ref>''Superman'' (2nd series) #22 (October 1988)</ref>

====Phantom Zone entity====
In the ''[[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]'' mini-series, the Eradicator was pressured into embracing his programming by another construct of Kem-L's.  This artifact, which was trapped in the Phantom Zone, claimed to be called Faora, after Kem-L's grandmother, and to be the ultimate repository of Kryptonian mythology.  However it is unclear how much of this is true.

The Eradicator rejected Faora, "downloading" all the aspects of Kem-L's programming that contradicted Dr. David Conner's morality into the Faora program.  Unknown to him, this gave it a new, monstrous form and the ability to leave the Zone, and it targeted Conner's family.  The Eradicator destroyed it, but not before it killed Conner's wife.

====Pokolistanian====
Another Faora was introduced as one of the aides of [[General Zod]] of the fictional nation of [[Pokolistan]].  This character, who debuted in ''Action Comics'' #779 (July 2001), was an orphan [[metahuman]].  Faora has the ability to disrupt molecular bonds.  She was the creator of the mutagenic virus which was the linchpin of Zod's plan.  Her whereabouts following the General's defeat are unknown.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===="Return to Krypton"====
In a 2001–2002 storyline, Superman and [[Lois Lane]] visited [[Krypton (comics)#Revisiting Krypton|a version of Krypton]] which is later revealed to have been created by the villainous [[Brainiac (comics)#Brainiac 13|Brainiac 13]] and based on [[Jor-El]]'s favorite period in Kryptonian history.<ref name="action793">{{Cite comic

==In other media==
===Film===
In the movies ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', the Kryptonian villainess [[Ursa (villain)|Ursa]] is based on Faora.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100818-New-Krypton-Countdown-1.html |title=New Krypton Countdown: When Kryptonians Walk the Earth |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Brownfield |first=Troy |authorlink=Troy Brownfield |author2=Matt Brady| work=[[Newsarama]].com |publisher=[[Imaginova]] Corporation |date=2008-10-18 }}</ref> She has a hatred of all men, young and old, except only Zod. She fights Superman alongside General Zod and [[Non (DC comics)|Non]].

In the 2013 feature film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', Sub-Commander '''Faora-Ul''' is portrayed by actress [[Antje Traue]]. In the film, she is [[General Zod|Zod's]] lieutenant, and is sentenced to 300 cycles in the Phantom Zone along with Zod and his forces. After Krypton's destruction, Faora and the other prisoners are freed from the Phantom Zone, and search for [[Superman|Kal-El]] and the Codex, a device containing the genetic code for all future Kryptonians, which were able to escape the planet's destruction due to [[Jor-El]]'s last-minute actions. After finding him on Earth, Faora is responsible for bringing Kal-El and [[Lois Lane]] aboard Zod's ship. After they escape, Faora and another powerful Kryptonian grunt named Nam-Ek, confront Kal-El and the [[U.S. Military]] in Smallville, but are defeated because Kal-El is better adapted to Earth's environment. After Zod begins terraforming the Earth with a world engine retrieved from a Kryptonian Colony that they visited before arriving to Earth, Faora and all the other Kryptonians (except Zod) are sent back to the Phantom Zone after the ship that brought Kal-El to Earth is re-purposed into a strike weapon. As in the comics, Faora is a major threat to Kal-El in hand-to-hand combat, outfighting him easily at first. However Kal-El is able to hold his own against her and Nam-Ek, since the two Kryptonians have yet to attain heat vision and flight and he is stronger than they are due to his longer exposure to solar radiation.

===Television===
Faora appeared in the 1988 ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' episode "The Hunter" voiced by [[Ginny McSwain]]. She appeared alongside [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] as a [[Phantom Zone]] prisoner and helped General Zod to create The Hunter (a creature that can transmute itself into any substance that it touches).

In the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' animated TV series, the pre-Crisis version of Faora can be seen in a cameo in the episode "Phantoms" as one of the many Phantom Zone villains attacking the Legion members when they were temporarily trapped there.

Faora made her live action debut appearance on ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''. In the season eight episode "Bloodline", Faora's disembodied form escapes the Phantom Zone via an "escape hatch" portal and proceeds to possess [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]). Faora (Durance) searches [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] where she encounters [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]]) and reveals that she's General Zod's wife and then reveals to [[Davis Bloome]] ([[Sam Witwer]]) that he is her and Zod's genetically engineered son (the ''Smallville'' incarnation of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) after they discovered they could not have children. Faora also remarks that Davis strongly resembles Zod. After a fight with [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] ([[Tom Welling]]), Faora's spirit was removed from Lois's body by [[Supergirl|Kara Kent]] ([[Laura Vandervoort]]). After the Orb in the possession of [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) released the Kandorian duplicates, a younger clone of Faora (played by [[Sharon Taylor (actress)|Sharon Taylor]]) became a recurring character. During season nine, Faora (Taylor) is both a loyal soldier and lover to Major Zod ([[Callum Blue]]). The episode "Pandora" shows an alternate future where Faora gained her Kryptonian abilities through Zod's solar tower and served Zod, wearing the Mark of Zod on her chest. The episode "Conspiracy" reveals that Faora has a younger sister '''Vala''' ([[Crystal Lowe]]). In the episode "Sacrifice", [[Amanda Waller]] ([[Pam Grier]]) takes Faora from the Kandorians (including Vala) and Faora offers to work with Checkmate when Zod attacks. Zod, angry with Faora's betrayal, strangles her, realizing too late that she was pregnant with their baby. Grieved by what he had done, Zod listened to his child's last heartbeats in Faora's womb. In the season finale "Salvation", Faora is avenged by Clark and the Kandorians once Zod's deception comes out much to the Kandorian's (including Vala's) shock.

Faora appeared in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' episode "SuperRabbit", voiced by [[Sonya Walger]].

===Video games===

The ''Man of Steel'' version of Faora appears via DLC as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.
