'''Faora''' is the name of several female [[super-villains]] in [[DC Comics]] ''[[Superman]]'' titles.  All of them have some connection to Superman's home planet of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].

==Pre-Crisis==
The first Faora was '''Faora Hu-Ul''', introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #471, May 1977.  She was a man-hater, who ran a secret concentration camp in her home on Krypton where she tortured men.  For this, she was subsequently imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]] to complete a sentence of 300 Kryptonian years, the second longest term after [[Jax-Ur]]<ref>Phantom Zone #1 (DC Comics, 1982)</ref>.  Ironically this allowed her, along with the other Phantom Zone prisoners, to survive her homeworld's destruction, albeit in an invisible ghostlike form.  While imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, she was often depicted plotting against [[Superman]] with [[General Zod]] and Jax-Ur.

Faora was an expert at the Kryptonian martial art of Horo-Kanu, which utilised the [[pressure points]] on the Kryptonian body.  This made her a dangerous foe for Superman to face in hand-to-hand combat.

==Post-Crisis==
===Pocket Universe===
Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], another Faora (renamed Zaora) appeared in the [[Pocket Universe]] created by the [[Time Trapper]], along with General Zod and [[Quex-Ul]].  The three tricked the Pocket Universe's [[Lex Luthor]] into releasing them from the Phantom Zone.  After the Pocket Earth's population continued to resist their conquest of it, the three villains destroyed the atmosphere, killing almost all life.  Superman defeated them by stripping the three of their super powers with [[gold kryptonite]].  He then killed them with [[green kryptonite]] in punishment for their crimes, and to protect the real Earth, after they threatened to somehow regain their powers and destroy it as well.<ref>Superman (2nd series) #22</ref>

===Phantom Zone entity===
In the ''[[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]'' mini-series, the Eradicator was pressured into embracing his programming by another construct of Kem-L's.  This artifact, which was trapped in the Phantom Zone, claimed to be called Faora, after Kem-L's grandmother, and to be the ultimate repository of Kryptonian mythology.  However it is unclear how much of this is true.

The Eradicator rejected Faora, "downloading" all the aspects of Kem-L's programming that contradicted Dr. David Conner's morality into the Faora program.  Unknown to him, this gave it a new, monstrous form and the ability to leave the Zone, and it targeted Conner's family.  The Eradicator destroyed it, but not before it killed Conner's wife.

===Pokolistanian===
One of the General Zod of Pokolistan's aides, introduced in ''Action Comics'' #779 (July 2001), was a [[metahuman]] who called herself Faora.  Since the spirit of the Pocket Universe General had supposedly spoken to this Zod, it may be assumed that he suggested she take this name for psychological effect.  Faora has the ability to disrupt molecular bonds.  She was the creator of the mutagenic virus which was the linchpin of Zod's plan.  Her whereabouts following the General's defeat are unknown.

==Other media==
In the movies ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', the female Kryptonian named [[Ursa (villain)|Ursa]] is based on Faora.  Her crimes are her hatred of all men, young and old.  She fights Superman alongside General Zod and Non.

The pre-Crisis version of Faora can be seen as a cameo in the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' episode "Phantoms" as one of the many Phantom Zone villains attacking the Legion members when they were temporarily trapped there.
