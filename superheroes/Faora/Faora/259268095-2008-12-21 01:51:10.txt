'''Faora''' is the name of several female [[super-villains]] in [[DC Comics]] ''[[Superman]]'' titles.  All of them have some connection to Superman's home planet of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Faora | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 118  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Pre-Crisis==
The first Faora, '''Faora Hu-Ul''', was introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #471.<ref>Action Comics #471(DC Comics, May 1977)</ref>  She was a beautiful Kryptonian woman whose unexplained hatred for men led her to torture and kill 23 men at a secret concentration camp in her home.  For this, she was imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]] to complete a sentence of 300 Kryptonian years, the second longest term after [[Jax-Ur]].<ref>Action Comics #472(DC Comics, June 1977)</ref> <ref>Phantom Zone #1 (DC Comics, 1982)</ref>  Ironically this allowed her to survive her homeworld's destruction, along with the other Phantom Zone prisoners, albeit in an invisible ghostlike form.  While imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, she was often depicted plotting against [[Superman]] with [[General Zod]] and Jax-Ur.  Her hatred of men was not limited to Kryptonians, as demonstrated by her pointless murder of a young Frenchman who was attracted by her beauty.<ref>Phantom Zone #3 (DC Comics, 1982)</ref>

Faora was an expert at the Kryptonian martial art of Horo-Kanu, which utilized the [[pressure points]] on the Kryptonian body.  This made her an extremely dangerous foe for Superman to face in hand-to-hand combat -- he was forced to flee from their first encounter.<ref>Action Comics #472(DC Comics, 1977)</ref>  During one of her first appearances<ref>Action Comics #473(DC Comics, July 1977)</ref>, Faora could manifest some sort of "mental lightning" to physically attack other Kryptonians, but did not exhibit this additional power during later appearances.

==Post-Crisis==
===Pocket Universe===
Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], another Faora (renamed Zaora) appeared in the [[Pocket Universe]] created by the [[Time Trapper]], along with General Zod and [[Quex-Ul]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>  The three tricked the Pocket Universe's [[Lex Luthor]] into releasing them from the Phantom Zone.  After the Pocket Earth's population continued to resist their conquest of it, the three villains destroyed the atmosphere, killing almost all life.  Superman defeated them by permanently stripping the three of their super powers with [[Kryptonite#Variations|gold kryptonite]].  He then killed them with [[green kryptonite]] in punishment for their crimes, and to protect the real Earth, after they threatened to somehow regain their powers and destroy it as well.<ref>Superman (2nd series) #22</ref>

===Phantom Zone entity===
In the ''[[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]'' mini-series, the Eradicator was pressured into embracing his programming by another construct of Kem-L's.  This artifact, which was trapped in the Phantom Zone, claimed to be called Faora, after Kem-L's grandmother, and to be the ultimate repository of Kryptonian mythology.  However it is unclear how much of this is true.

The Eradicator rejected Faora, "downloading" all the aspects of Kem-L's programming that contradicted Dr. David Conner's morality into the Faora program.  Unknown to him, this gave it a new, monstrous form and the ability to leave the Zone, and it targeted Conner's family.  The Eradicator destroyed it, but not before it killed Conner's wife.

===Pokolistanian===
Another Faora was introduced as one of the aides of [[General Zod]] of the fictional nation of [[Pokolistan]].  This character, who debuted in ''Action Comics'' #779 (July 2001), was an orphan [[metahuman]] who had been raised .  Faora has the ability to disrupt molecular bonds.  She was the creator of the mutagenic virus which was the linchpin of Zod's plan.  Her whereabouts following the General's defeat are unknown.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other media==
===Films===
In the movies ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', the female Kryptonian named [[Ursa (villain)|Ursa]] is based on Faora.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100818-New-Krypton-Countdown-1.html |title=New Krypton Countdown: When Kryptonians Walk the Earth |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Brownfield |first=Troy |authorlink=Troy Brownfield |coauthors=Matt Brady| work=[[Newsarama]].com |publisher=[[Imaginova]] Corporation |date=2008-10-18 }}</ref>  Her crimes are her hatred of all men, young and old.  She fights Superman alongside General Zod and [[Non (DC comics)|Non]].

===''Legion of Super-Heroes''===
The pre-Crisis version of Faora can be seen as a cameo in the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' episode "Phantoms" as one of the many Phantom Zone villains attacking the Legion members when they were temporarily trapped there.

===''Smallville''===
Faora makes her first ever live action appearance on Smallville in the season eight episode "Bloodline". On Smallville she is the wife of Zod. Faora breaks out of the Phantom Zone after [[Lois Lane|Lois Lane]] escapes from the Zone.
Faora proceeds to possess Lois's body to search Metropolis for her son, [[Doomsday (comics)|Davis Bloome]]. After Faora explains to Davis his orgin, she stabs him in the chest in order to speed up his 'evolution'.

During an encounter with Clark, [[Supergirl |Kara]] imprisions Faora by using a crystal from [[Martian Manhunter |John Jones]]
