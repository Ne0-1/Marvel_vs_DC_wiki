==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
The first Faora, '''Faora Hu-Ul''', was introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #471.<ref>''Action Comics'' #471 (May 1977)</ref>  She was a beautiful Kryptonian woman whose unexplained hatred for men led her to torture and kill 23 men at a secret concentration camp in her home.  For this, she was imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]] to complete a sentence of 300 Kryptonian years, the second longest term after [[Jax-Ur]].<ref name=ac472>''Action Comics'' #472 (June 1977)</ref><ref>''Phantom Zone'' #1 (January 1982)</ref> Ironically this allowed her to survive her homeworld's destruction, along with the other Phantom Zone prisoners, albeit in an invisible ghostlike form.  While imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, she was often depicted plotting against [[Superman]] with [[General Zod]] and Jax-Ur.  Her hatred of men was not limited to Kryptonians, as demonstrated by her pointless murder of a young Frenchman who was attracted by her beauty.<ref>''Phantom Zone'' #3 (March 1982)</ref>

Faora was an expert at the Kryptonian martial art of Horo-Kanu, which utilized the [[pressure points]] on the Kryptonian body.  This made her an extremely dangerous foe for Superman to face in hand-to-hand combat—he was forced to flee from their first encounter.<ref name=ac472 /> During one of her first appearances,<ref>''Action Comics'' #473 (July 1977)</ref> Faora could manifest some sort of "mental lightning" to physically attack other Kryptonians, but did not exhibit this additional power during later appearances.

===Post-Crisis===
====Pocket Universe====

Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], another Faora (renamed '''Zaora''') appeared in the [[Pocket universe|Pocket Universe]] created by the [[Time Trapper]], along with [[General Zod]] and [[Quex-Ul]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> The three tricked the [[Pocket universe|Pocket Universe]]'s [[Lex Luthor]] into releasing them from the [[Phantom Zone]]. After the Pocket Earth's population continued to resist their conquest of it, the three villains destroyed the atmosphere, killing almost all life.  Superman defeated them by permanently stripping the three of their super powers with [[Kryptonite#Variations|gold kryptonite]].  He then killed them with [[green kryptonite]] in punishment for their crimes, and to protect the real Earth, after they threatened to somehow regain their powers and destroy it as well.<ref>''Superman'' (2nd series) #22 (October 1988)</ref>

====Phantom Zone entity====
In the ''[[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]'' mini-series, the Eradicator was pressured into embracing his programming by another construct of Kem-L's.  This artifact, which was trapped in the Phantom Zone, claimed to be called Faora, after Kem-L's grandmother, and to be the ultimate repository of Kryptonian mythology.  However it is unclear how much of this is true.

The Eradicator rejected Faora, "downloading" all the aspects of Kem-L's programming that contradicted Dr. David Conner's morality into the Faora program.  Unknown to him, this gave it a new, monstrous form and the ability to leave the Zone, and it targeted Conner's family.  The Eradicator destroyed it, but not before it killed Conner's wife.

====Pokolistanian====
Another Faora was introduced as one of the aides of [[General Zod]] of the fictional nation of [[Pokolistan]].  This character, who debuted in ''Action Comics'' #779 (July 2001), was an orphan [[metahuman]].  Faora has the ability to disrupt molecular bonds.  She was the creator of the mutagenic virus which was the linchpin of Zod's plan.  Her whereabouts following the General's defeat are unknown.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===="Return to Krypton"====
In a 2001–2002 storyline, Superman and [[Lois Lane]] visited [[Krypton (comics)#Revisiting Krypton|a version of Krypton]] which is later revealed to have been created by the villainous [[Brainiac (comics)#Brainiac 13|Brainiac 13]] and based on [[Jor-El]]'s favorite period in Kryptonian history.<ref name="action793">{{Cite comic

==In other media==
===Films===
In the movies ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Superman II]]'', the female Kryptonian named [[Ursa (villain)|Ursa]] is based on Faora.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100818-New-Krypton-Countdown-1.html |title=New Krypton Countdown: When Kryptonians Walk the Earth |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Brownfield |first=Troy |authorlink=Troy Brownfield |coauthors=Matt Brady| work=[[Newsarama]].com |publisher=[[Imaginova]] Corporation |date=2008-10-18 }}</ref> Her crimes are her hatred of all men, young and old, save only Zod. She fights Superman alongside General Zod and [[Non (DC comics)|Non]].

In the 2013 feature film ''Man of Steel'', Faora will be portrayed by actress [[Antje Traue]] .

===Television===
In the 1988 animated ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' TV series, Faora appeared alongside [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] as a [[Phantom Zone]] prisoner in the  episode "The Hunter".

In the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' animated TV series, the pre-Crisis version of Faora can be seen in a cameo in the episode "Phantoms" as one of the many Phantom Zone villains attacking the Legion members when they were temporarily trapped there.

Faora made her live action debut appearance on ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' in the season eight episode "Bloodline" as the wife of [[General Zod]]. Faora (in disembodied form) escapes the Phantom Zone and leaves through the "escape hatch" portal that [[Zor-El]] ([[Christopher Heyerdahl]]) built for [[Supergirl|Kara Kent]] ([[Laura Vandervoort]]). Faora proceeds to possess the body of [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]) and search [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] for [[Doomsday (comics)|Davis Bloome]] ([[Sam Witwer]]), who turns out to be her and Zod's son. After Faora explains to Davis his origins, she stabs him in the chest in order to speed up his "evolution". During an encounter with Clark Kent ([[Tom Welling]]), Faora tried to kill Clark by choking him, but after Clark freed himself from Faora, Kara managed to imprison Faora in the Phantom Zone once again by using a crystal from [[Martian Manhunter|John Jones]] ([[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]).

A clone of Faora, played by ([[Sharon Taylor (actress)|Sharon Taylor]]) became a recurring character when [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) opened the orb, through the use of the death of Davis Bloome at the hands of [[Jimmy Olsen]] ([[Aaron Ashmore]]). Faora was in a cloned body of her original form from before she married Zod and became evil.  she had memories from her original self's life, meaning that she was confused as to why she was not able to possess natural Kryptonian powers under a yellow sun. However, it is also revealed in the same episode that [[Jor-El]] ([[Julian Sands]]) sabotaged the Orb so that when Zod and Faora and the others arrived on Earth, they would not have Kryptonian powers under a yellow sun to protect the Earth from them. In the episode, ''Savior'', after they are released from the Orb and take Tess hostage, they questioned Zod about their powerless states. When Zod refused to tell them and told them to kneel before him, the soldiers rebelled against Zod and took him hostage until they realized what they were to do. However, Zod managed to win back their trust and allegiance. In the episode "Kandor" Faora was with Kandorian soldiers (Basqat and Alia) when Zod spoke to Jor-El after they kidnapped him from Tess' cellar while Zod was flirting with Tess in order to distract her, and then releasing him after Zod was done beating him. The episode "Pandora" shows an alternate future where Faora gained her Kryptonian abilities through Zod's solar tower and served Zod, wearing the Mark of Zod on her chest. She helped Zod evade the Resistance attack at the Luthor Mansion. In the real timeline, Faora was present when Zod was issuing orders to his troops to ensure that the solar tower will be built. Faora was due to be given orders, but Clark Kent interrupted the proceedings before Faora and the rest of the soldiers were ordered by Zod to "Kneel before Kal-El". 

In the episode "Persuasion", as Faora read a newspaper at a Metropolis newsstand, Clark appeared to remind her not to show her Kryptonian dog tags. Faora continued to mourn the loss of the solar tower following its destruction by Clark. In the episode "Conspiracy", Clark meets Faora's younger sister Vala ([[Crystal Lowe]]) at the bookstore Vala worked at. Faora told her sister to close the shop to get some cappuccinos. Unbeknownst to Faora, Vala was abducted by Dr. Bernard Chisholm ([[JR Bourne]]). Faora and Clark teamed up to find Chisholm and Vala. In the episode "Sacrifice", Clark arrived in the middle of a Kryptonian ceremony where Faora told him they were waiting for Zod's return so they could ask for his forgiveness. Clark took her to the barn and showed her the diary of Dr. Virgil Swann ([[Christopher Reeve]]), revealing that Zod had destroyed Krypton. Faora was devastated, and Clark used his powers to find out she was pregnant with Zod's child (Suggesting that the original Faora's infertility was the result of unspecified damage to her womb that the clone didn't inherit). Faora then told Clark that Zod was after the Book of Rao. Faora went back to her fellow Kandorians and tried to convince them to live a life of peace on Earth when they are attacked by [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and their leader, [[Amanda Waller]]. Amanda Waller took Faora away from the Kandorians, and Faora offered to work with Checkmate when Zod attacked Waller and took Faora away before Clark could stop them. Zod was angry with Faora's betrayal and, when she refused to kneel, he strangled her to death, but afterwards realized she was pregnant with their baby. Grieved by what he had done, Zod listened to his child's last heartbeats in Faora's womb. After Faora is killed Zod blames Checkmate for her death, convincing the surviving Kandorians that the humans will never let them live in peace and to join Zod's army.

In the episode "Salvation" (the Season finale of Season 9), Faora was avenged by the other Kandorians and Clark when General Zod was exposed and he would be [[Phantom Zone|punished]] for taking her life.
