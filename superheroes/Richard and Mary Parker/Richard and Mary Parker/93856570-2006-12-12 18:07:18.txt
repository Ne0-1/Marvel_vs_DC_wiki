'''Richard and Mary Parker''' are fictional characters of [[Marvel Comics]]. They were the parents of Peter Parker, the boy who one day would become [[Spider-Man]].

==Publication history==
Prior to ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #5, there had been no explanation of why Peter Parker was an orphan and was raised by his aunt and uncle.  That issue finally answered the question.  Richard and Mary Parker only appeared in brief flashbacks in the story.

For many more years, the characters appeared only in flashbacks and photographs.  However, in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #365 (August 1992), Spider-Man's 30th anniversary, they reappeared.  Two years later, in #388 (April 1994) they were revealed to be imposters and killed, setting the stage for the [[Clone Saga]].

In July of 1997, ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #-1, part of Marvel Comics' "Flashback Month" event, written by [[Roger Stern]] and drawn by [[John Romita, Sr.]], expanded the characters' origins.  Since then, they have rarely been mentioned except in passing.

==Fictional character biographies==
'''Captain Richard Parker''', a decorated operative of the [[United States Army Special Forces]], was recruited by [[Nick Fury]] to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]].  His brother, many years older than he was, was [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], who was married to [[Aunt May|May Reilly Parker]].

'''Mary Fitzpatrick''' was the daughter of [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] agent "Wild Will" Fitzpatrick.  She attended the best schools and eventually followed in her father's footsteps, becoming a C.I.A. translator and data analyst.

Richard and Mary met on the job, fell in love, and married.  Mary became a field agent like Richard, giving them both an easy cover as a married couple.  They were assigned to investigate Baroness Adelicia Von Krupp, who had captured an agent of a "friendly power" (who turned out to be [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]], aka Wolverine, then a [[Canada|Canadian]] operative called Agent Ten).  They rescued Logan from the Baroness and [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]].  After that mission, they discovered that Mary was pregnant.

Their son [[Spider-Man|Peter Benjamin Parker]] was born some months later.  However, Richard and Mary were frequently away from him on missions.  While they were away, he was left in the care of Richard's older brother Ben and his wife May.

Richard and Mary became agents for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] when it broke off from the C.I.A.  While on a mission to investigate Albert Malik, the third [[Red Skull]], they posed as [[treason|traitors]] and [[double agents]] to infiltrate his criminal organization in [[Algeria]].  Unfortunately they were discovered, and Malik framed them and had them killed by an assassin called the Finisher.  Finisher sabotaged their [[Fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]] and caused it to crash.

===After death===
Richard and Mary's son Peter grows up to become the [[superhero]] Spider-Man.  Although he has no memory of his parents, his aunt and uncle share photographs and happy memories with him... but not their belief that they had been traitors to their country.  When Peter discovers this, he travels to [[Algeria]].  He finds Malik, who sends the Finisher to kill Spider-Man.  Spider-Man turns the Finisher's missile against him, and the Finisher dies, but not before revealing that Richard and Mary were in fact innocent.  Spider-Man returns to America with evidence and clears his parents' names. <!-- in a late 1990s annual, he fights the son of a guy his parents killed.  But... I can't remember enough to write about it.  -->

===Life Model Decoys===
Years later, the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], working for [[Harry Osborn]], created [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Richard and Mary.  These LMDs were near-perfect robotic replicas of Peter's dead parents, and convinced him that they had in fact been held captive overseas for most of his life.  When he discovered that they were fake, he suffered a nervous breakdown.

==Alternate continuities==
*In the alternate reality of [[MC2]], Peter names his son [[Benjamin Richard Parker]], with his second name being in honor of his father.
*In the alternate reality created by the [[Scarlet Witch]] during the [[House of M]] storyline, Peter and [[Gwen Stacy]] name their son Richard.
*The 2003 [[limited series]] ''[[Trouble (comic book)|Trouble]]'' was marketed as the "true origin" of Spider-Man.  In that story, characters named Richard and Mary met while on summer vacation, and Mary's friend May rather than Mary herself was Peter's mother.  None of the characters' last names were revealed.  The story was later ignored due to negative fan reception.
*In ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Peter Parquagh's parents are briefly mentioned as having worked with Sir Nicholas Fury, Queen Elizabeth's spymaster.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Richard "Ray" Parker was a biologist instead of a spy.  He and Mary supposedly died in an airplane accident when Peter was six, and Peter still has vague memories of his parents.  Before the crash, Richard was working on a cure for [[cancer]], in the form of a biological suit that could repair its host body.  He recorded a series of tapes addressed to Peter, in which he revealed that he was worried that the suit would be used as a weapon instead of a cure.  A tape recorded just before the crash revealed that his project had been taken away from him.  His project became the basis of [[Ultimate Venom]].  His name and work were known by scientists (including [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Wasp|Wasp]] and [[Henry Pym#Ultimate Henry Pym|Giant Man]] of the [[Ultimates]]) involved in re-creating the super-soldier formula that created [[Captain America#Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]].

{{spoilers}}
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #100, it was  revealed though that the plane trip was to see the man who took away the cancer cure project, [[Bolivar Trask]] to rejoin the research staff.  Richard however, had second thoughts about working on the project, now knowing it would be used as a weapon, and didn't get on the plane.  Mary, however, felt that Richard was a fool for not taking the opportunity, and seemed willing to leave him over this.  After the crash, Richard then was approached by government agent [[Henry Gyrich]], for the purposes of launching their own research projects in case [[Nick Fury]] was ever to go rogue.  After learning through a surveillance video shown by Gyrich that his son was Spider-Man, he saw May Parker, who was incredulous that Richard was alive all this time, and told him to go away.  He then tried to go to Peter's school, but Gyrich prevented him from doing so.  After Peter found a revived Gwen Stacy, however, Richard finally went to May's house to try to explain everything.  However, after telling of what happened to him, Nick Fury's men and Spider-Slayers surround the house, which leads to Gwen becoming nervous, and she transforms into what appears to be [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].

Artist [[Mark Bagley]] based the likeness of the Ultimate version of Richard Parker on that of Peter Parker as drawn by [[John Romita, Sr.]] and [[Gil Kane]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  He felt he had not adequately captured Peter's appearance during his earlier run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' in the 1990s.<ref name="bagley-likeness">Interview with [[Mark Bagley]] and [[Brian Michael Bendis]] in ''[[Wizard: The Guide to Comics]]'' #180 (2006).</ref>

==In other media==
In the "[[Sinister Six]]" novel trilogy by [[Adam-Troy Castro]] (''Gathering of the Sinister Six'', ''Revenge of the Sinister Six'', and ''Secret of the Sinister Six''), a man known only as the Gentleman--an internationally known criminal mastermind--was revealed to have been partially responsible for Richard and Mary's deaths.  The possibility was also raised that Spider-Man had an older sister: the Gentleman's ward, a young woman called Pity. <!-- don't spoil the ending! -->

The bios of Richard and Mary Parker were also included in ''Spider-Man: The Animated Series'' where they appeared in an allusion created by Baron Mordo to Peter Parker in the third season premiere, where Mordo was acting like Parker's parents.  And finally, it is revealed in the only five-part episode of the series in season five, the ''Six Forgotten Warriors'' saga, that Peter's parents were spies from America who were snooping in on a machine called the Doomsday Device created by The Red Skull in Russia.  However, Parker's parents were then considered in S.H.I.E.L.D. files that they were traitors to America from Russia, and they died in a plane crash.  When Peter was taken into his Uncle Ben and Aunt May's custody, they never revealed to their nephew about his parents' legal status before their deaths.  But when Peter become a young adult after his Uncle Ben's death when he was shot dead by a criminal, which led to his origin of being Spider-Man, and was married to a clone of Mary Jane Watson (who wasn't revealed to have been a clone until the following episode of the five-part saga), Peter found his parents' airplane passports in the attic of his Aunt May's house, showing them to her.  She was so stressed out, and Peter's Uncle Ben's former friend, Keane Marlow, tried to coerce May into having reveal Richard and Mary's status of being traitors and to get the ring of The Destroyer in World War II out of the house.  Peter, as Spider-Man, snuck into S.H.I.E.L.D. and overheard from Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. that Peter Parker's were traitors to America and when Peter wanted more answers, May revealed to Peter about something he didn't want to know about his parents.  But however, Keane Marlow knew that his parents were framed and Peter decided to go to Russia to somehow clear his parents' names, getting enough proof that should clear their names and that they died as heroes.
