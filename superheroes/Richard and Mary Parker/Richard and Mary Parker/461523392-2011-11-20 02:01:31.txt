'''Richard and Mary Parker''' are fictional characters of [[Marvel Comics]]. They were the parents of Peter Parker, the boy who one day would become [[Spider-Man]]. They will appear in [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|the 2012 reboot of the Spider-Man film franchise]]. Richard Parker was also briefly mentioned by Uncle Ben in the 2002 [[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man film]]. 

==Publication history==
Prior to ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #5 (published in 1968), there had been no explanation of why Peter Parker was an orphan and was raised by his aunt and uncle.  That issue finally answered the question.  Richard and Mary Parker only appeared in brief flashbacks in the story.

For many more years, the characters appeared only in flashbacks and photographs.  However, in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #365 (August 1992), Spider-Man's 30th anniversary, they reappeared.  Two years later, in #388 (April 1994) they were revealed to be robots created by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and were destroyed.

In July 1997, ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #-1, part of Marvel Comics' "Flashback Month" event, written by [[Roger Stern]] and drawn by [[John Romita, Sr.]], expanded the characters' origins.  Since then, they have rarely been mentioned except in passing.

==Fictional character biographies==
'''Captain Richard Parker''', a decorated soldier of the [[United States Army Special Forces]], was recruited by [[Nick Fury]] to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]].  His much older brother, [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], was married to [[Aunt May|May Reilly Parker]].

'''Mary Fitzpatrick''' was the daughter of [[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]] agent "Wild Will" Fitzpatrick.  She attended the best schools and eventually followed in her father's footsteps, becoming a C.I.A. translator and data analyst.

Richard and Mary met on the job, fell in love, and married. Originally they eloped, then later had a more elaborate service, fooling many. Mary became a field agent like Richard, giving them both an easy cover as a married couple.  They were assigned to investigate Baroness Adelicia Von Krupp, who had captured an agent of a "friendly power" (who turned out to be [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]], aka Wolverine, then a [[Canada|Canadian]] operative called Agent Ten).  They rescued Logan from the Baroness and [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]].  After that mission, they discovered that Mary was pregnant; Logan was actually the first person to congratulate the Parkers, commenting later that he never saw an agent as tough as Richard Parker go that white that fast.

Their son [[Spider-Man|Peter Benjamin Parker]] was born some months later.  However, Richard and Mary were frequently away from him on missions.  While they were away, he was left in the care of Richard's older brother Ben and his wife May.

While on a mission to investigate [[Red Skull (Albert Malik)|Albert Malik]], the third [[Red Skull]], they posed as [[treason|traitors]] and [[double agents]] to infiltrate his criminal organization in [[Algeria]].  Unfortunately they were discovered. Malik framed them and brought in an assassin called the Finisher to kill the two.  Finisher sabotaged their [[Fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]] and caused it to crash. They were subsequently declared [[missing in action]]/[[presumed dead]]<ref name="SMU">''Spider-Man: Unmasked''</ref>, as two burnt bodies were found in the remains.

===After death===
Richard and Mary's son Peter grew up to become the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]].  Although he has only vague memories of his parents and no memory of their militaristic history, his aunt and uncle share photographs and happy memories with him, but not their belief that they had been traitors to their country.  When Peter discovers this, he travels to [[Algeria]].  He finds Malik, who sends the Finisher to kill Spider-Man.  Spider-Man turns the Finisher's missile against him, and the Finisher dies, but not before revealing that Richard and Mary were in fact innocent.  Spider-Man returns to America with evidence and clears his parents' names.<ref name="ASMA 5">''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #5</ref> <!-- in a late 1990s annual, he fights the son of a guy his parents killed.  But... I can't remember enough to write about it.  -->

===Life Model Decoys===
Years later, the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], working for [[Harry Osborn]], created [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Richard and Mary.  These LMDs were near-perfect robotic replicas of Peter's dead parents, and managed to convince him that they had in fact been held captive overseas for most of his life.<ref name="ASM 366">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #366</ref> Aunt May retains some suspicions, as there are some things they did not know, such as Richard and Mary's elopement. When Peter discovers that they were fake,<ref name="ASM 388">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #388</ref> he suffers a nervous breakdown. When the Decoys were ordered to attack Parker, Mary's feelings for Peter causes her to save him. Neither LMD survives the incident. After battling the Chameleon, Spider-Man discovers that Harry Osborn was behind the whole thing, as an effort to avenge his (supposedly) dead father, [[Norman Osborn]].<ref name="ASM 389">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #389</ref> Spider-Man then becomes mentally unhinged over time, until he has a near-death experience.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

May Parker eventually learns the truth about the Life Model Decoys, via learning the truth about Spider-Man. May draws strength by talking to the graves of Mary, Richard and Ben about Peter's life.

The cynical mindset of Harry Osborn and the Chameleon was present in the LMDs, particularly during ''[[Maximum Carnage]]''<ref name="SM Max Carnage">''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1-2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101-103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378-380; ''Spider-Man'' #35-37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201-203</ref>: When Aunt May advises Peter to "listen to your heart," (the pseudo) "Richard" tells a very different lesson<ref name="SSM 201">''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201</ref>: {{quote|Strip away the veneer of society and civilization and you'll find a devil inside ''all'' men. ... That prison was overrun with devils, Peter. Sadistic evil men who'd do anything—no matter how twisted, how immoral—to break a man down. Destroy his ''soul'' ... Oh, sure there ''are'' good men in the world. Your uncle Ben was ''one'' of them. And look where it got him. ''Dead.'' Shot down like a dog. And knowing my brother, he was probably looking up at the scum who did it—trying to understand ''why''. But when it comes to the devils, Peter—there ''is'' no why. No rhyme or reason. ... Use whatever means possible to stop the madness—before it swallows you ''up''. ...|Richard Parker}} Later, when [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] uses her psychic powers to turn the whole town against Spider-Man and the other super-heroes, "Richard" remarks that the "moral," "orderly" world he remembered while in prison "was just an ''illusion!'' The evil was here—all along—''festering'' beneath the surface!"—inviting a sharp rebuke from Peter's wife, [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]].<ref name="SM 37">''Spider-Man'' #37</ref> (After his "parents" are exposed as frauds, some of this cynicism rubs off for a while on the "son"—with Spider-Man becoming unusually brutal against his enemies and developing a "Spider" alternate personality.)

===Ambiguities in Marvel documentation===
The nature and timing of Richard and Mary Parker's fate are somewhat ambiguous in [[Spider-Man]] documentation. For one thing, the very fact that Harry Osborn and the Chameleon were ''able'' to fool the [[State Department]], Peter, and (for a time) Aunt May into thinking Richard and Mary had "returned" after 20 years implies that the government was never able to solidly confirm the bodies found in the original plane crash to be theirs.<ref name="SM Whole Storyline">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #366. The entire Richard-and-Mary-Parker LMD storyline lasts from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #363 (last page) to ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #389.</ref> This uncertainty was exploited by Harry Osborn and the Chameleon: When explaining how he and Mary "survived", the false Richard Parker asserts that the bodies found were of Russian spies who stayed on the plane while they themselves were forced to jump out.<ref name="ASM 366"/> According to ''Spider-Man: Unmasked'', "young Peter was orphaned at an early age when his parents were declared missing in action"—once again implying that they were not "officially" considered dead by the authorities—although they were presumed so, at least until the Life Model Decoys appeared on the scene.

It is also ambiguous ''how'' old Peter was when his parents were lost: Some accounts have it happening in his infancy<ref name="ASM 364">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #364</ref>; others say he was as old as six years<ref name="Official Handbook">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004</ref>—particularly, ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004. The latter view is supported by Spider-Man's musing, during ''The Child Within''<ref name="SSM Child Within">''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #178-183</ref>, that he ''remembers'' his parents, yet "they were practically ''strangers'' to me," as he prepares to fight [[Harry Osborn]]/The Green Goblin and [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]]<ref name="SSM180">''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #180</ref>:—during the fight, Harry drugs Peter and subsequently discovers that Peter blames himself for his parents' death<ref name="SSM 181">''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #181</ref>; Harry conceives the LMD scam to "avenge" his own father shortly after.<ref name="ASM 389"/> Another, more comprehensive book on the Marvel Universe (also released in 2004) asserts that Peter's only clear memory of his (real) parents was of the moment they were boarding the fateful plane and he promised them he'd be a "good boy" for Aunt May and Uncle Ben.{{Issue|date: unknown|date=April 2011}} Most Spider-Man stories in the main continuity are vague about Peter's exact age when he was effectively orphaned.

==Other versions==
===1602===
In ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', Peter Parker's parents are briefly mentioned as having worked with Sir Nicholas Fury, Queen Elizabeth's chief of security.

===Bullet Points===
In the alternate timeline of ''Bullet Points'', Ben is killed a few months into his relationship with May Parker. Richard and Mary promise to "always be there for her," a vow which was later broken.<ref name="BP 1">''Bullet Points'' #1 (2006)</ref>

===House of M===
In the alternate reality created by the [[Scarlet Witch]] during the [[House of M]] storyline, Peter and [[Gwen Stacy]] name their son Richard. Generally, Peter's sons in alternate realities are named after his [[Uncle Ben]], but in House of M, Ben had lived, and so Peter did not pay tribute to him.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
Although Richard has not appeared in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] continuity nor has he been mentioned, Mary had made her appearance instead. In this version, Mary is Aunt May's sister instead of Uncle Ben being Richard's brother, and is both the leader of the Spider Clan and is a Spider demon, who is known as the Spider Queen. She's been plotting to make her son, Peter Parker, the new leader of the Clan and sends the Elementals to kill her sister, May Parker, so that it would lead Peter to her. When the two are confronted, Mary revealed she wanted Peter to become the new leader of the Spider Clan, but Peter figured out and was shocked and disgusted that she would send the Elementals to kill her own sister which causes him to reject the offer and begin to attack her. However Mary teleported him back to New York were she had sent the Elementals to fight him. Disappointed by his rejection, Mary instead passes leadership of the Spider Clan to her pupil, Venom. Because of this, Peter has decided to quit his identity as Spider-Man.

===MC2===
In the alternate reality of [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Peter names his son [[Benjamin Richard Parker]], with his second name being in honor of his father.

===''Trouble''===
The 2003 [[Epic Comics]] [[limited series]] ''[[Trouble (comic book)|Trouble]]'' was marketed as the "true origin" of Spider-Man.  In that story, characters named Richard and Mary met while on summer vacation, and Mary's friend May rather than Mary herself was Peter's mother.  None of the characters' last names were revealed.  The story was later ignored due to negative fan reception.

===Ultimate Richard Parker===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, '''Richard "Ray" Parker''' was a biologist instead of a spy.  He and Mary supposedly died in an airplane accident when Peter was six, and Peter still has vague memories of his parents.  Before the crash, Richard was working on a cure for [[cancer]], in the form of a biological suit that could repair its host body.  He recorded a series of tapes addressed to Peter, in which he revealed that he was worried that the suit would be used as a weapon instead of a cure.  A tape recorded just before the crash revealed that his project had been taken away from him.  His project became the basis of [[Venom (comics)#Ultimate Spider-Man|Venom]].  His name and work were known by scientists (including [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Wasp|Wasp]] and [[Henry Pym#Ultimate Henry Pym|Giant Man]] of the [[Ultimates]]) involved in re-creating the super-soldier formula that created [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]].

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #100, an aged clone of Peter Parker with false memories appeared. The clone recounted that [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Bolivar Trask|Bolivar Trask]], the man responsible for shutting down the cancer cure project, brought the research staff back together.  Richard had second thoughts about working on the project, now knowing the suit he developed would be used as a weapon, and chose not to get on the plane.  Mary, however, felt that Richard was a fool for turning down this opportunity, and appeared willing to leave her husband for this reason.  (This contradicts her earlier sentiments, that Richard was getting in way over his head).  After the crash, Richard was approached by government agent [[Henry Peter Gyrich#Ultimate Marvel|Henry Gyrich]], for the purposes of launching his own research project in case [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] was ever to go rogue.  Gyrich showed Richard a surveillance video proving his son, Peter, was the amazing Spider-Man.  Afterwards, he revealed himself to May Parker.  May, shocked by the possibility that Richard was alive all this time, told him to go away.  Richard then preceded to go to Peter's high school, but Gyrich prevented him from doing so.  After Peter found a revived Gwen Stacy, however, Richard finally went to May's house to try to explain everything.  However, after telling of what happened to him, Nick Fury's men and Spider-Slayers surrounded the house.  Gwen becomes nervous and immediately transforms into what appears to be the ultimate version of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].

Later, in issue 103, Doctor [[Doctor Octopus#Ultimate Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] (who created multiple clones of Spider-Man) reveals that "Richard Parker" was a clone. This is confirmed when [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Sue Storm|Susan Storm]] of the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]] runs a test on a sample of Richard's DNA and finds it identical to Peter Parker's. Apparently, the cloning process severely aged Richard. Though his memories were false, Richard still deeply loves Peter like a son.  Before he dies, Richard asks Sue Storm and the rest of the Four to look after Peter.

In the final FMV of the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, it is implied that Eddie Brock Sr. and the Venom suit are responsible for the plane crash that killed Peter's parents.

However, in issue #4 of ''[[Ultimate Origins]]'', which takes place 15 years before the current Ultimate timeline, Richard is shown to have been hired by the U.S. government and [[Ultimate Nick Fury]] as part of a project to recreate the [[Super Soldier Serum]]. At a covert lab in [[Dover, New Jersey]], Richard worked alongside fellow scientists, [[Hank Pym#Ultimate Henry Pym|Hank Pym]], [[Franklin Storm#Ultimate Franklin Storm|Franklin Storm]], father of [[Ultimate Fantastic Four#The Team|Sue and Johnny Storm]], and [[Alternative versions of Hulk#Ultimate Hulk|Bruce Banner]].<ref name="Ult Origins 3">''Ultimate Origins'' #3 (2008)</ref>

One day, while Pym and Banner are inside the lab testing a possible match to the serum that was discovered by Banner, Richard is just outside the lab being visited by his wife and recently born son, Peter. Unfortunately, Banner, having just tested his serum on himself, transforms into the Hulk for the first time and goes on a rampage, destroying the complex. Richard and Mary and both caught in an explosion of debris, and are killed. 

The sight of the infant Peter lying next to his mother's body is enough to shock Banner back to his human form, in time for Fury and his men to arrive and subdue him. As his men haul Banner into custody, Fury picks the infant off the ground and carries him away from the site, stating that Peter is at least lucky enough to be too young to remember any of what has happened later on.<ref name="Ult Orig 4">''Ultimate Origins'' #4 (2008)</ref>

Artist [[Mark Bagley]] based the likeness of the Ultimate version of Richard Parker on that of Peter Parker as drawn by [[John Romita, Sr.]] and [[Gil Kane]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  He felt he had not adequately captured Peter's appearance during his earlier run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' in the 1990s.<ref name="bagley-likeness">Interview with [[Mark Bagley]] and [[Brian Michael Bendis]] in ''[[Wizard: The Guide to Comics]]'' #180 (2006).</ref>

==Other media==
===Television===
* Richard and Mary Parker appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' as an illusion created by [[Baron Mordo]] in the third season premiere. In the fifth-season "[[Six Forgotten Warriors]]" saga, it is revealed that Peter's parents were spies investigating a machine called the Doomsday Device created by the [[Red Skull]] in [[Russia]]. After learning from [[Nick Fury]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] that his parents were traitors, Peter traveled to Russia and cleared their names. He had help from Uncle Ben's friend Keen Marlow (the [[Golden Age of comics|Golden Age]] superhero the [[Destroyer (Timely Comics)|Destroyer]]).

* Though never appearing nor named in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', Peter and Eddie Brock's fathers are mentioned as having been scientists that worked together. Both sets of parents died in a plane crash, much like their Ultimate counterparts.

===Video games===
* Richard Parker was featured in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game voiced by [[Loren Lester]].

===Novels===
* In the "[[Sinister Six]]" novel trilogy by [[Adam-Troy Castro]] (''Gathering of the Sinister Six'', ''Revenge of the Sinister Six'', and ''Secret of the Sinister Six''), a man known only as the Gentleman - an internationally known criminal mastermind, currently in his late nineties and possessing a strong disdain for the rest of humanity, as well as being the brother of the Red Skull's assassin the Finisher - was revealed to have been partially responsible for Richard and Mary's deaths, having revealed their true identities to the Red Skull, only asking that Peter be spared so that he would be more of a challenge later on in life. The possibility was also raised that Spider-Man had an older sister: the Gentleman's ward, a young woman called Pity, who was capable of climbing walls, possessed a strength level approximately equal to Spider-Man, and could create a "darkness" that prevented anyone around her from seeing anything. At the conclusion of this trilogy, Peter Parker meets [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]], who reveals that he worked regularly with the Parkers on joint missions between the American and Canadian secret services; the discovery that Logan was the first person to congratulate Richard after they learned that Mary was pregnant with Peter prompted Peter to say "Wolverine's practically my Uncle."  <!-- don't spoil the ending! -->
