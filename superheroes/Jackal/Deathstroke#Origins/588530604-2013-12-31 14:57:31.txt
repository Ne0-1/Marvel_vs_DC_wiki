==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}
Deathstroke the Terminator first appeared in 1980, in the second issue of the book ''New Teen Titans''. He was originally introduced as "the Terminator", a mercenary who was completing the terms of a contract undertaken by his son [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]], but he quickly became one of the main antagonists for the Titans. Deathstroke quickly became a fan favorite character{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and later in the series often allied with the Titans against mutual threats.

Due to his popularity, Deathstroke received his own series, ''Deathstroke the Terminator'', in [[1991 in comics|1991]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 250 |quote = "Slade Wilson began his impressive sixty-issue run with the help of writer Marv Wolfman and artist Steve Erwin.}}</ref> It was retitled ''Deathstroke the Hunted'' for issues #0 and #41-45; and then simply ''Deathstroke'' for issues #46-60. The series was cancelled with issue #60. In total, ''Deathstroke'' ran for 65 issues (#1-60, plus 4 annuals and a special #0 issue).

Following his injury in ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament'', Deathstroke appears in one of the four ''[[Faces of Evil]]'' one-shots, written by [[David Hine]]. Hine has explained that the series is part of the set-up for future stories: "All of the characters in this ‘Faces of Evil’ series were selected for their potential as major players in the coming year."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18794 | title=David Hine on Deathstroke's Return | last=Renaud | first=Jeffrey | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=November 12, 2008}}</ref>

Even though the character of Deathstroke the Terminator predates [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[The Terminator]]'' by four years, the Slade Wilson character is now simply called Deathstroke, even by characters who had called him Terminator for years. The full title has not completely fallen out of use, having been referenced as recently as ''[[Justice League Elite]]''.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===

Slade Wilson was sixteen years old when he first enlisted in the [[United States Army]], having lied about his age. After serving a stint in Korea, he was later assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of Major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him, and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare. In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child. The war in Vietnam began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas. In the war, his unit massacred a village, which sickened him. He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor.

Chosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with enhanced physical powers in an attempt to create [[metahuman]] [[supersoldier]]s for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]] sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge.<ref name="dc-ency"/> However, Slade kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor. Indeed, she had been responsible for a significant portion of his early training.

A criminal named the Jackal took his younger son [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]] hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin. Slade refused, claiming it was against his personal honor code. He attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous. Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying Joseph's [[vocal folds|vocal cords]] and rendering him mute.

After taking Joseph to the hospital, his wife Adeline Wilson enraged at his endangerment of her son tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye. Afterward, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black, featureless half covering his lost eye. Without his mask, Slade wears an eye-patch.

===The Teen Titans===
[[File:Tt2ravager.PNG|left|170px|thumb|Cover to ''New Teen Titans'' (vol. 1) #2. The first appearance of Deathstroke (in the shadows). Art by George Pérez.]]
Slade has a long history as an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the [[H.I.V.E.]], dubbing himself [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]], and accepting a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans. However, those enhancements proved fatal in the end, and Slade agreed to complete the contract. His first mission involved stealing the fictional element Promethium from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and selling it as the ultimate weapon. He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone. The Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded [[Beast Boy|Changeling]] in his escape. This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two.

Deathstroke next appeared in New York, holding officials hostage in order to lure the Titans into confronting him. [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], a new ally of the Titans, and Changeling were the only ones available to answer the call. Terra knocked Changeling out in an effort to prove herself worthy of being a Titan and fought Deathstroke single-handedly. Slade escaped as the other Titans arrived, but by then Terra had proven herself and the team offered her membership. Later that night, it was revealed that Terra and Deathstroke had conspired to fake the fight in a plot to infiltrate the team. It was also revealed that they shared an intimate relationship, despite Terra being fifteen years old.<ref name="dc-ency"/> The artist, George Pérez, noted that this technically constituted "[[statutory rape]]" even though Terra consented.<ref>{{cite book | last=Nolen-Weathington | first=Eric | coauthors=George Pérez | title=Modern Masters Volume 2: George Pérez | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | page=128 | isbn=978-1-893905-25-2}}</ref>

===Judas Contract===
The Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities. Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically take down each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments. [[Donna Troy]] was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was poisoned with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, [[Starfire (comics)|Koriand'r]] was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] was taken down by Terra herself. [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself. He narrowly avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken. Nightwing arrived at [[Titans Tower]] to discover Slade's ex-wife and son. She told Nightwing that Terra was a traitor, how each of his teammates were captured, and related the origin of Deathstroke.

Nightwing, in order to confront Deathstroke and the [[H.I.V.E.]], joined [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] (Joseph Wilson). During the confrontation, Deathstroke recognized Jericho as his son which caused him to hesitate. Jericho freed the Titans by possessing his father's body. Terra turned on Deathstroke, thinking he betrayed her as well. After her suicide, Slade was taken into custody.

Slade was put on trial for his crimes, but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by Changeling so that he could kill Slade himself, believing he was responsible for Terra's betrayal of the Titans. Slade agreed to the confrontation, but showed up out of costume. Changeling found himself unable to kill Slade, so instead they talked. Feeling some empathy for his grief, Slade explained his past with Terra, and Changeling realized Slade was not to blame for the choices Terra had made. The two men parted on peaceful terms, with Slade returning to Africa with Wintergreen.

===Titans Plague===
Months later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances. [[Donna Troy]] is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter. Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, Gar Logan recognizes Slade trying to maintain a low profile. When he finally catches up with Slade, he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser Walter Lanier. He stops Deathstroke, but is surprised when Lanier turns into a bat-like creature and flies away. Slade reveals to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late. After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion.

===Titans Hunt===
Shortly after this, he came to the Titans' assistance again during the ''Titans Hunt'' storyline. The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the ''Judas Contract''. [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], an on-and-off member of the [[Doom Patrol]], hires Deathstroke to find the missing Titans. He eventually discovers with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest Society]], and that their leader was none other than Titan member Jericho, Deathstroke's son.

It was revealed that Jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of [[Azarath]] as they were using him to capture the Titans and use them as physical hosts in order to survive. During the transfer process, Jericho's true self resurfaced briefly, begging his father to kill him. To spare his son any more pain and save the remaining Titans, Slade was forced to drive a sword through Jericho's heart, seemingly killing him. This act still haunts him to this day.

Afterward, Slade continued his life as a mercenary, but also acted as an occasional hero, aiding the Titans or acting on his own to help others, most notably during the ''Total Chaos'' storyline when the [[Team Titans]] arrived in the 20th Century to assassinate Donna Troy before she could give birth to her son, who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot, [[Lord Chaos (DC Comics)|Lord Chaos]]. Slade also met Pat Trayce, a tough former cop who would become the new [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. Pat Trayce and Slade quickly became lovers, and began a tumultuous on-again/off-again relationship.

===Family business===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AddieHIVE.jpg|right|thumb|Deathstroke finds his wife Addie dying.]] -->
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Roseslade.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Deathstroke with his daughter, [[Rose Wilson]].]] -->
After Slade thwarted an assassination attempt on the [[President of the United States]], he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S. Senator. The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones. Eventually, with the help of the Titans and [[Sarge Steel]], Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.

Meanwhile, Slade's relationship with his estranged wife Adeline took a tragic turn as Slade underwent a process to gain the ability of physical regeneration, allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact (but this power is limited as Slade cannot regenerate his lost eye because that injury happened before he gained his healing factor). After gaining this power, Slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion to save her life, resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality. This alteration of her DNA drove Adeline insane, shaming Deathstroke into going into a semi-retirement state.

In ''Titans'' (vol. 1) #12, Deathstroke teamed up with the Titans to face his wife Adeline, who in her insane state had revived the H.I.V.E. and sought to rid the world of all superhumans, blaming them for Jericho's apparent death. During the battle, interrupted by [[Vandal Savage]] and a band of villains that he had organized from recent Titans battles, Adeline's throat was slit. In a brief return of sanity, she begged Slade to kill her, requesting him to reunite her with "my... ''our'' children..." because her version of the healing factor would not heal the wound, but only allow her to live in spite of it. Deathstroke refused, but Koriand'r shocked her teammates and Deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrate her completely, per Adeline's wishes. This was a turning point, as Deathstroke renounced all ties with the Titans as a result of Starfire's act.

It was then revealed that Jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into Deathstroke in the instant before his death. Taking control of his father, Jericho forced Deathstroke to murder his longtime butler, mentor and companion Wintergreen. He then launched a series of attacks against the current Teen Titans, most notably shattering [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'s knee with a shotgun blast, before leaving his father's body. Deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child [[Rose Wilson]] into the mercenary business as the new Ravager, in order to find and kill Jericho, using a specially designed serum to heighten her hostility and push her over the edge. Unfortunately, the process also resulted in her being driven at least partially insane, to the extent that she cut out her own left eye in an attempt to prove to her father that she was just like him.

===Nightwing and Birds of Prey===
Deathstroke appeared in ''[[Nightwing]]'' #23 as a mercenary against [[Black Canary]] and [[Conner Hawke]] as part of the "Brotherhood of the Fist" tie-in to the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc.<ref>''Nightwing'' #23</ref>

Deathstroke also appeared in ''[[Birds of Prey]]'' #22-24, where he was sent to [[Gorilla City]] by [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] to get an ape-heart. He is accompanied by [[Lady Vic]], [[Grimm (DC comics)|Grimm]], and Black Canary, who is posing as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]].

===Identity Crisis===
In the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], who was being pursued by the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] as a suspect in the murder of [[Sue Dibny]]. In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of [[Elongated Man]], [[Wally West|Flash]], [[Zatanna]], [[Hawkman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]]. He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower. Fortunately, before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him. Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground. Dr. Light used his powers to allow the two to escape. Near the end of ''Identity Crisis'', Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop. Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone. Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket. The note reads "''This is yours - We're not done''.".

===Infinite Crisis===
Deathstroke was a founding member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. He was seen in ''Infinite Crisis'' #1, hiding in a warehouse south of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] waiting to ambush the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] with several other members. The battle didn't last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the [[Phantom Lady]]. Slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death).<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He was the employer of Nightwing, whom he hired to train his daughter Rose. However, after the two had a confrontation with [[Superman]], Deathstroke discovered that Nightwing had been teaching Rose the values of heroism. He could not kill Grayson in front of his daughter, because doing so would undo all of Slade's teachings. Nightwing offered a deal: he would stay away from Rose if Slade would keep the [[metahuman]] villains out of [[Blüdhaven]]. The deal held for 34 hours until ''Infinite Crisis'' #4, when Slade, under the orders of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], the real leader of the Society, went with several villains (including old Titans and Doom Patrol foes and [[Brotherhood of Evil]] members [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Brain (comics)|Brain]]) to drop [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]], another fellow villain who appeared to be a nearly brainless monster made of pure energy and radioactive chemicals, on [[Blüdhaven]], killing over one-hundred thousand people. Slade gave the explanation to the Brotherhood that Nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again.

Nightwing took the first of his revenge by bursting in on Deathstroke and Rose's training session, revealing to the latter that the [[Kryptonite]] that Deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to [[Kryptonian]]s (as revealed by Luthor's old possession of a Kryptonite ring that forced him to transfer his brain to a cloned body). Angered, Slade went after Nightwing with a grenade, only to have Rose try to stop him. Amid the smoke of the resulting explosion, Rose fled, telling her father that she hated him. Nightwing disappeared as well, but not before leaving a note for Slade warning him that he would be back to make him pay for Blüdhaven.

At the climactic Battle of Metropolis at the conclusion of ''Infinite Crisis'', Slade was confronted by [[Batman]], [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and Nightwing. During the struggle, he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the Secret Society. His claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory; Batman accused him of having forsaken his code of honor, and Nightwing said it was because his family had abandoned him. Enraged, Slade said that was because of Nightwing, and that it was always because of him, before Batman told him to take responsibility for his actions and he was rendered unconscious.

===One Year Later===
[[File:Titanseast.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Cover to ''Teen Titans'' #43: Titans East Part 1. Art by [[Tony Daniel]].]]
Slade appears in the ''Green Arrow'' series after the [[One Year Later|one year jump]] in DC Comics' storylines. Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] businessmen who want to hire him for a murder. Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target. When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job.<ref>''Green Arrow'' #60 (May 2006)</ref>

However, things do not quite go according to plan, with Green Arrow using the resources of both his identities, trapping him within a ring of armed [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]].<ref>''Green Arrow'' #62 (July 2006)</ref> The fight ends with Deathstroke's arrest<ref>''Green Arrow'' #63 (August 2006)</ref> and subsequent conviction and incarceration;<ref>''Green Arrow'' #64 (September 2006)</ref> however, this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to [[Constantine Drakon]], another jailed foe of Green Arrow who has information on the hero's activities in the lost year,<ref>''Green Arrow'' #65 (October 2006)</ref> which include Green Arrow studying under [[Natas (comics)|Natas]], an assassin who once trained Deathstroke himself.<ref>''Green Arrow'' #66 (November 2006)</ref>

Deathstroke is also active behind the scenes in ''Teen Titans'', currently in the process of organizing a counter-team of teen superhumans that will be known as [[Titans East]]. The current Titans team included Ravager, who now wanted nothing to do with her father. Deathstroke seemingly intended to "reclaim" Ravager and a recently resurrected Jericho from the Titans or, if that failed, to crush them along with the rest of the team. For these reasons, he specially selected each member of Titans East, believing that, overall, each member would successfully counteract every member of the current Teen Titans line-up.

As indicated over the course of the subsequent issues, Deathstroke was manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another. He had blackmailed former Titan [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage; was drugging [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]] with the same serum he had used on Rose; and supplied [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a formula which granted superhuman speed to compensate for the loss of the [[Speed Force]] following the initial battle with [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]]. His team, however, slowly fell apart over the course of the attack, as Robin managed to free Batgirl of his mind control serum and Raven convinced [[Duela Dent]] to switch sides. Slade and his remaining Titans subsequently faced off against both the current Titans and a group of old Titans led by Nightwing. Although he was defeated, he still managed to escape with the aid of Inertia. In the end, however, it was revealed to the readers that Slade's real mission was to provide his children with something he could never offer them: a real family, in the form of the Teen Titans. By attacking the Titans, he insured that Rose and Jericho would become more trusted by their associates, and thus grow closer to the team.

Recently, Deathstroke took credit for somehow twisting (through unknown means) the powers of [[Geo-Force]], the half-brother of the original Terra, into the same powers as his traitorous sister. Using this leverage, Deathstroke offered to reverse the process only if Geo-Force became his own personal spy within the Justice League. Unfortunately for Deathstroke, Geo-Force alerted Batman, [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] of Deathstroke's scheme, which culminated in Geo-Force alerting the League that Deathstroke (whose rivalry with Green Arrow has reached vendetta-level proportions) planned on using an army of supervillains to crash Green Arrow and Black Canary's wedding. Weeks later, Geo-Force was tortured by [[Gorilla Grodd]] after the League was kidnapped by the [[Injustice League]], and ultimately transferred to Batman's newest incarnation of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] afterward, robbing Deathstroke of his potential pawn.

Deathstroke can be seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.

Deathstroke is gravely injured with his own sword by Geo-Force in ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament''. Following his injury, he is recuperating at [[Belle Reve]] while doctors labor to save him. Deathstroke dreams of his family members and all of the people that he has let down. When he awakens, he vows that he will never again be haunted by the past.

Ravager comes to visit him, but in fact, wants to finish her father off. She tries to strangle him with a plastic wire, but Deathstroke is recuperated enough that he can fend off her attack. He escapes from the facility and steals a helicopter. Later, Deathstroke finds a young street urchin that he decides to take under his wing.<ref>''Faces of Evil: Deathstroke''</ref>

===Blackest Night===
In the ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen's house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade, and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. Deathstroke and Rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #77 (November 2009)</ref>

The two hopelessly fight the regenerating Black Lanterns until Jericho, cured from his earlier insanity, arrives and turns the tide of the fight. During the course of the battle, Deathstroke confesses to his children that part of the reason why he menaced the Teen Titans for so many years was that he felt that by forcing his children to hate him, they would have a chance of escaping the sorrow and pain a life with him would entail. Just as Slade is overwhelmed and about to be killed, Jericho somehow uses his abilities to sever the connection between the Black Lanterns and their [[power ring (DC Comics)|power rings]], permanently sending them back to the grave. After realizing that her mother was not reborn as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Rose comes to the conclusion that she must somehow still be alive, and leaves after threatening to kill Slade if he tries to stop her. Jericho chooses to stay with his father, reasoning that only Slade would have the courage to kill him if he were to ever return to madness.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #78 (December 2009)</ref>

===Batman and Robin===
Recently, Deathstroke has been seen working with [[Talia al Ghul]], controlling the body and physical actions of the current [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] in order to kill the recent [[Dick Grayson|Batman]]. Deathstroke is able to control Robin's actions thanks to a neural-implant inserted into Robin's spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced. Batman defeats Deathstroke by taking advantage of the two-way connection between him and Robin by using a taser on Robin, the resulting electric shock overwhelming Deathstroke's enhanced senses. He then tracks Slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling Robin and for the Chemo attack, informing Slade that what happened then, is just a 'trailer' for what he will do later.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #9 (February 2010)</ref>

===Titans: Villains for Hire===
Following the encounter with the Black Lanterns, Deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of [[Tattooed Man]], [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and the new character [[Cinder (comics)|Cinder]] following the launch of ''[[Brightest Day]]''. The team ambushes [[Ryan Choi]] in his home, and then battles him. This ends with Deathstroke driving his sword through Ryan's chest, killing him. He then gives the deceased hero's body to Dwarfstar.<ref>''Titans: Villains for Hire Special'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>

Following the assassination of the Atom, Deathstroke and the Titans are hired to kill Lex Luthor during his stay in [[Midway City]]. The attack is revealed to be a ruse crafted by Slade and Luthor in order to draw out a traitor on Luthor's security staff who is revealed to be a shape-shifting assassin named Facade.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24-25</ref> After the Titans capture Facade and turn him over to the scientists at [[LexCorp]], Luthor rewards Slade by examining technology that he had earlier ordered Tattooed Man and Cheshire to steal. Slade claims that this will bring him one step closer to his true goal: the ability to somehow cheat death itself. He also succeeds in recruiting [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]], a former member of the Teen Titans and Justice League, into the team.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #26</ref> Shortly after inducting Arsenal into the team, Slade accepts a mission to rescue a child from a drug lord named Elijah. After discovering that Elijah is using the bodies of kidnapped children to create an addictive drug called Bliss, the Titans promptly kill the gangster and shut down his operation. As the Titans are preparing to return to the Labyrinth, Cheshire notices that Slade has tied up DJ Molecule, a powerful metahuman who was working for Elijah as a bodyguard. When asked what he is doing with the young man, Slade cryptically responds by saying that he only accepted the mission in order capture Molecule for some unknown purpose.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #27</ref>

Afterward, Slade and his team arrive at South Pacific Island to kill cult leader Drago over the arena production of blind warriors; however, his team, Arsenal, and Cheshire betray him, revealing that they had been working with Drago. While Slade is held captive, Drago arrives and reveals to him that he is actually Slade's old friend, Corporal Daniel Rogers, who abandoned him during the civil war in Afghanistan. Drago then gouges out Slade’s left eye making him blind.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #33 (March 2011)</ref> Slade is then imprisoned along with Arsenal and begins to tell him about his past with Drago.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 2011)</ref> Later, Drago takes a trip down memory lane with Slade, explaining how he lost his sight, and basically re-telling his origin and how it involved Jeremiah, right before he throws Slade beneath the complex to fend for his life against a crazed subhuman.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #35 (May 2011)</ref> During the fights, Slade's left eye was restored due to his metahuman healing factor, and the Titans arrive to rescue him.

During the battle of Slade's Titans against the Justice League in [[Khandaq]], the battle was stopped by [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], who forces them to choose between leaving or continuing the fight and starting ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]''. The Justice League chose to retreat and Slade retrieves from [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]'s Kryptonian blood. Upon returning to the labyrinth, with his workers, [[Doctor Sivana]] and [[Doctor Impossible]], Slade reveals to the Titans that their efforts support creation of a diabolical invention call the "Methuselah Device" for his dying son [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]].<ref>''Titans Annual 2011'' (July 2011)</ref>

The machine successfully heals Jericho, and Slade offers its abilities to all the Titans, offering to restore their deceased loved ones as payment for their services.

===The New 52===
[[File:Deathstroke_Vol_2_1.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Cover to ''Deathstroke'' (vol. 2) #1. Artwork by Simon Bisley]]
====Deathstroke====
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #1</ref> Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs. Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane. After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain [[Clayface]], Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession. Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone. Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode - namely the mask and knife belonging to his son [[Ravager (comics)|Grant]], both of which were stained with fresh blood indicating that he may be alive.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #2</ref> During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #5</ref> Deathstroke kills Legacy, but another Legacy, donning the same colors as the last one, appears again, and again. It turns out the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color, to get revenge on him. Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant. It is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure Deathstroke to him. Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superior of Deathstroke. Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves. Recovering from his injuries, he takes another contract, happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father's hospital bed to mention he has grown up to be a greater man than him.

Slade takes a contract from Harvest, to bring the [[Ravager (comics)|Ravagers]] back to the colony. He does this in exchange for his daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose]] and [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]. It turns out that [[John Lynch (comics)|Lynch]], the leader of [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]] had needed Terra to stop a rampaging [[Mr. Majestic|Majestic]], who was thought to be killed by Dinah Drake's sonic scream. For a plan B, to Slade's dismay, he calls in [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]], now going by the name Jericho, with Adeline and Grant, to stop Majestic. Instead of stopping Majestic, Jericho takes control of Majestic, Adeline, Grant, and Terra to kill his father. Adeline dies, buried in the rubble caused by Majestic's stampede. Jericho momentarily loses control by this, and Slade, Rose, and Terra manages to restrain Majestic, with the help of Rose's Gen-factor. However, Jericho retains control over Grant and Terra. When Slade knocks Terra unconscious, a cornered Jericho threatens to stab himself and Grant with a sword. Deathstroke, without hesitation, drives the sword into both of them, killing them instantly. But a later scene suggests Jericho has escaped, since there is shown a worker with glowing green eyes walking out of the clean-up scene, strongly implying Jericho has possessed the man to flee.

====Origins====
Deathstroke's altered origin is introduced in ''Deathstroke #0''. The fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met Adeline has not changed. Already a legend in the army, Slade was drafted into Team 7 and went on many missions. In one mission, Slade was gravely injured and had to go under an operation that enhanced his abilities, making him virtually a super-human. After this, he married Adeline and had two sons, Grant and Joseph. Around this time, Slade received intel that informed his best friend, Wintergreen was caught in Somalia. He donned a mask and flew to Somalia to rescue Wintergreen, slaughtering all the captors. Deathstroke the Terminator was born. As his fame grew, his enemies did too. An attack targeting his house seemingly killed Joseph and Adeline. With evidence that the attack was from North Korea, Slade vengefully killed a pack of North Korean soldiers, but lost his right eye in the process. It is later shown that Joseph and Adeline are still alive.
 
This origin was again changed in ''Teen Titans: Deathstroke #1''. After a mission that involved detonating a children's hospital which Slade was unaware of, he quit the army. After Team 7's termination, Slade started to operate under the Deathstroke identity. He took Grant on his mission, considering him as not only his son, but as a business partner, and the only person he could trust. But during in a mission in North Korea, their refuge was infiltrated and North Korean soldiers barged in, firing into the house. Grant was shot, and as Slade looked backwards at his son, a bullet penetrated through his right eye, blinding it. Enraged, Slade went on a massacre and slew the soldiers. However, Grant was presumed dead. Now, Slade works for the sake of his daughter Rose, as he knows the only thing that will keep Rose safe after he's gone, is money. It is unclear if Rose's mother is Adeline or not.

====Team 7====
Five years before taking the contract from Harvest, before taking the name Deathstroke, Slade once operated with ''Team 7''. With metahuman threats rising, ''The Majestic Project'', a plan to control future metahuman threats was schemed by John Lynch. And to secure the project, Team 7 was created and Slade was recruited. The first mission was retrieving the [[Eclipso]] Gem, where Slade was possessed by Eclipso and Alex Fairchild had to drive a sword through his chest to save him. Their next mission site is the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center. [[Hank Henshaw|Dr. Henshaw]] is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan. But the Spartan Subject is activated, infecting everyone in the center to be turned into mindless cyborgs including [[Caitlin Fairchild]]. Team 7 is sent to the spot. Pilot Summer Ramos is killed by a cyborg. The team breaks into the facility, intending to bottleneck them. Caitlin appears out from a door. Relived to see his daughter, Alex Fairchild rushes to her and hugs her, but actually infected, Caitlin stabs her father to death. In a fit of rage, Slade chases after her and dispatches her. Then from behind, Henshaw, temporarily free of the Spartan virus, explained that this was a distraction by the Spartan Subject to target agent James Bronson, currently at his home. A Spartan Cyborg breaks into his apartment, and attacks, activating Majestic. Majestic actually turns out to be agent Bronson's gen factor, which was activated when the Kaizen, the dictator of the island nation of Gamorra sent the cyborg to trigger the Majestic Persona. It is later explained by Lynch that another purpose of Team 7 was to activate potential meta-genes in the agents to create powerful human weapons, which would make America invincible to other nations. Agents like Slade, [[Dinah Drake]], and [[Cole Cash]] had gained their meta-human abilities by Lynch. Bronson was planned to be Majestic, but the activation of the gene just then had been unexpected. 

Team 7's last mission was to salvage Pandora's Box. The Team, with new pilot [[Steve Trevor]] is sent to Gamorra. The Kaizen, who possessed Pandora's Box, prepared to unleash its power. When they reach the Kaizen's palace, the child precogs show the Team a future where Kaizen Gamorra has opened the Box, and the whole world is going off the rails. Hearing the precogs say the Kaizen had to be stopped to prevent this fate, Majestic flies up into space, and impacts the coast of Gamorra with the force of a comet, creating a massive tidal wave, annihilating five million residents. But the Kaizen's palace stood however, and the team couldn't defeat him, until Majestic burst in. The Kaizen explains that Majestic is the key to opening the box, which also explains why he targeted Bronson in the first place. Majestic kills the Kaizen with a single blow. But he subdues to the Box's power, and starts attacking the team. Dinah lets out a canary cry that destroys the entire palace. In the chaos, Lynch is possessed by the box, but [[Amanda Waller]] knocks the box from his hands and tells Dinah to take the box away as far as possible. Lynch tries to take down the helicopter containing Dinah and the remaining team agents, but Waller shoots him from behind, seemingly killing Lynch and leading to Team 7's dissolution.

====Forever Evil====
During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Steve Trevor encounters Deathstroke, [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Shadow Thief]] at the White House when he is looking for the President.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Deathstroke possesses various enhanced abilities stated to be almost superhuman according to DC Bios and Comic bios.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} These include the strength of ten men and heightened speed, agility, stamina, and reflexes. He has the capacity to [[10% of brain myth|use up to 90% of his brain]] at any one time, making him a tactical genius, adept at turning opponents' own abilities against them; this can also be attributed to his years in the military and combat with various heroes. Deathstroke also possesses a healing factor in his blood that enables him to heal from physical injury much faster than a normal person; however, it does have limitations, as he could not heal his missing eye and cannot regenerate entire limbs. This enables him to recover from what would otherwise be fatal injuries, though recovering from such injuries renders him insane and animalistic for a short period. Deathstroke is also a very formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat. He has also shown multilingualism, being able to speak various languages such as Russian, Japanese, and Korean.

''Green Arrow'' (vol. 4) #66 claims that an assassin known as [[Natas (comics)|Natas]] taught Deathstroke "almost everything he knows" (a retcon of his origin in ''The New Teen Titans: Judas Contract'', where his future wife, Adeline Kane, trained him while he was in the military). Deathstroke is also skilled in the use of many weapons including guns, rifles, and swords, which are usually among his current weapons of choice. His signature weapon is a power staff that fires lethal and non-lethal energy blasts from both ends. The staff can also be used to strike using energy at each end. His body armor is composed of a mesh-woven, [[kevlar]], chainlink [[Mail (armour)|mail]], capable of stopping small arms fire. Most of the metal he wears and uses is Promethium. However, in the New 52, he wears a full suit composed of Nth metal. This armor allows him to absorb blows from some of the mightiest DC beings, as evidenced by it being able to absorb numerous blows from [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].

===Television===
 
[[File:Slade Wilson (arrow).png|thumb|200px|Slade Wilson played by Manu Bennett]]
* In the pilot for the series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', there is a brief glimpse of Deathstroke's mask<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=39066 |title=Will Deathstroke Hunt The CW's "Arrow"? |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> impaled on a wooden post outside Oliver's campsite on the island where he was stranded. There are actually two men who wear this trademark balaclava, standard gear for a mercenary unit called [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]], of which the two men are the only survivors. The first was introduced in the fifth episode, "Damaged", as part of mercenary unit led by [[Eddie Fyers|Edward Fyers]] trying to locate [[Great Ten|Yao Fei]]; he tortures Oliver to learn Yao Fei's location.  The character was played by stuntman Jeffrey C. Robinson. In the thirteenth episode "Betrayal", the second man is identified as Slade Wilson, portrayed by [[Manu Bennett]],<ref>[http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/11/30/arrow-manu-bennett 'Arrow' casts 'Spartacus' favorite in major role -- EXCLUSIVE]</ref> and it is revealed that Robinson's character is another member of Slade's [[Team 7 (comics)|mercenary unit]] who shares his iconic mask. Unlike the comic book incarnation, the mask has two eye holes and Wilson has both his eyes. The mask shown in the pilot episode has an arrow in the right eye-hole; this can be seen again in the first episode of Season Two, when Oliver has traveled back to the island following the events of Season One's finale.<ref>[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7vuaxzdFV9s/UIlUyXZ4HjI/AAAAAAAAJjg/HY_SFdH2h_w/s1600/Green%252520Arrow%252520Deathstroke4.jpeg]</ref> Oliver meets Slade Wilson in "Betrayal", having been sent there by Yao-Fei to become Slade's partner in helping Yao-Fei escape the island. In this incarnation, Slade is of Australian descent (and an [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] Agent) but does not typically wear the mask or battle costume that Robinson's character wears. At the end of the episode, Oliver discovers Slade's identical mask. Slade reveals his loyalties and explains that the one who tortured Oliver was his former partner, [[Wintergreen (comics)|Billy Wintergreen]]. In the episode "Odyssey", Slade and Wintergreen duel.  The final scene shows Wintergreen lying on the ground with Slade's knife protruding through Wintergreen's mask in the right eye area.  It is not revealed if Wintergreen is dead. Manu Bennett continues to portray Slade in island flashbacks, where he trains Oliver alongside [[Shado (DC Comics)|Shado]], and assists him in taking down Fyers and his mercenary unit. In "Broken Dolls," the right half of Slade's face is caught on fire, and in "Keep Your Enemies Closer," it is shown that he survived, but the right half of his face is now blackened, resembling his mask. In "The Scientist" Oliver, Shado, and [[Black Canary|Sara]] manage to find a Japanese World War 2 submarine that holds a drug that [[Professor Ivo]] was looking for and injects him with it. After suffering the pain of the drug, he passes out with no pulse. In the midseason finale "Three Ghosts" it is revealed that Slade survived the injection of the mirakuru and it granted him the same strength as Cyrus Gold. The blood being used to recreate the drug is revealed to come from samples of Slade's blood. The midseason finale shows that Slade is still alive but wearing an eyepatch. Blood is working for him and Slade intends to keep Oliver alive until he can destroy everyone Oliver cares about, at which point he will "drive an arrow through his eye".
* In the ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' episode "Bob and Carol and Lois and Clark", an assassin by the name of Deathstroke (played by [[Antonio Sabàto, Jr.]]) appeared. The only commonality is the fact that he is an international assassin known as Deathstroke. Deathstroke is a former scientist when an accident in the lab exposed him to magnetic particles, permanently altering his body and granting him magnetic powers. His assistant becomes his wife ([[Sydney Walsh]]) and helps by creating a special suit to contain his powers and keep metal from being drawn to him while out in public. The suit even has a symbol of its own resembling the force lines of a magnetic field, forming a stylized figure eight. After this, he becomes an assassin, murdering his targets with his powers, first by drawing the target to him, then by magnetizing the iron in their blood cells, causing a figure-eight mark on the chest as the person dies of a heart attack. He and his wife rationalize their actions as being the result of the accident, leaving them with no other way to make a living and rendering him a "freak". The couple take the name '''Bob Stanton''' and '''Carol Stanton''' when they arrive in Metropolis. They become friends with [[Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane]] as they discover that Lois is going to be interviewing an eccentric reclusive billionaire. The couple plan to assassinate the billionaire before he goes public, taking his identity and thus his fortune. The plan is foiled when Superman interferes, destroying Deathstroke's containment suit, which causes him to be magnetically drawn to a steel pillar until the police arrive. Very much like Superman, this Deathstroke kept a secret identity by wearing a pair of glasses.

[[File:SladeTTanimated2003.jpg|thumb|185px|Slade in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.]]
* Deathstroke, going simply by his first name, Slade, appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]. As a nod to his comic counterpart, his mask only has one eye-hole, though his "true" face is never shown. At one point, he wore a disguise that closely resembles his face from the comics. Underneath his mask, his face was silhouetted by a shadow (with brightly colored slicked back hair) and later a scar running through his right eye socket. He appears to have access to extremely advanced technology and various secret hideouts, nearly unlimited resources, and a vast army of robot [[henchman|minions]]. However, Slade's most notable quality is that he is a master of manipulation and psychology, allowing him to get his foes to do almost anything he wants through shrewd manipulation. Although most of his operations are purely scientific in nature, he seems to possess some knowledge of ceremonial [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Slade has enhanced strength, an enhanced healing factor, a degree of super speed, and well-trained in many forms of combat. However, he was easy to anger which was eventually taken advantage of. He is also changed from a mercenary and assassin to an enigmatic criminal mastermind, dispatching slews of super villains and android ninjas to kill the Teen Titans instead of directly coming after them himself. Slade is shown to be ambitious, calculating, and incredibly sadistic. But his underestimating of the bonds that exist between all the Teen Titans and his fury over not being able to sever those bonds have often led to his undoing. His main goal is apparently to kill the Titans and possibly conquer the world. Slade appears as the main antagonist in seasons one and two and a supporting villain in season four. In the first season, Slade seeks out [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] as an apprentice when he coerces into working for him by threatening to kill the other Titans with [[nanorobotics|nanobot]]s. But when Robin is almost killed with Slade's nanobots, Slade gives in and is then defeated by the Titans. In the second season, Slade seeks Terra as another apprentice due to her desire for control and acceptance which he preys on. However, Slade is killed when Terra drops him into a lava-filled pit. Although he was mostly absent in the third season with [[Brother Blood]] acting as the main villain, hallucinations of Slade appears harassing Robin due to a chemical reagent released from his mask but Robin eventually figures this out and overcomes the hallucination. In the fourth season, Slade returns as an undead servant of [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]]. Now enjoying working for someone else, he is empowered with vast [[pyrokinetic]] abilities, superhuman strength and durability, flight, regeneration, phasing, electricity generation, teleportation, and other supernatural powers to harass Raven. Slade entered into the deal in exchange for being brought back to life, but was predictably betrayed. Intent on getting his due, he helps Robin find Raven, locating the source of power which restores his mortal form along the way. He aids the Teen Titans in defeating Trigon afterward and escapes capture after the world is saved. Afterwards, Slade appears when [[Beast Boy]] is searching for answers on why a girl who appears to be Terra that seems to have lost all memory of her past and superpowers. Slade confronts Beast Boy denying anything to do with Terra's sudden return and stating that if Terra does not remember her past, it is because she does not want to remember and that he should leave her in peace. Infuriated by his speech, Beast Boy attacks Slade only to find out that it is just another robot duplicate. He is also the only main Titan villain still at large at the end of the series.

* Slade Wilson appears in the tenth and final season of ''[[Smallville]]'' portrayed by [[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]. In the show, he is a [[United States Army]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] that is behind the Vigilante Registration Act, anti-superhero legislation that he has propagated while under the influence of [[Darkseid]]. In order to find out what Slade has planned, [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] volunteers to register. [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] meanwhile confronts Slade, and discovers that Slade is a suspected war-criminal, known for torture and illegal methods of torture and interrogation. She however is too late to warn Oliver, and he along with [[Aquaman|A.C.]] are captured by Slade in a holding facility which is equipped with holding cells that can adapt to the heroes' abilities. [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] free Oliver and A.C., but Slade sets off the base's self-destruction. He survives the explosion but at the cost of his right eye, and having advanced healing abilities (Slade described it as "advanced Military tech"). Having uncovered a significant amount of information about the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], Wilson attacks Lois at the [[LuthorCorp]] Tower and tries to force her to lead him to Clark and [[Justice League Watchtower#Smallville|the group's secret headquarters]]. Although [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] saves Lois by fighting Slade using his signature [[Katana]], Hawkman dies saving her life. After surviving an explosion which would have killed a normal human, Wilson tells Clark that he is "beyond Death's stroke, now." so Clark uses a [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]ian crystal to send him to the [[Phantom Zone]] later saying that he would release him to stand trial after the VRA is repealed. However, [[General Zod|Zod]] sends Slade back to Earth, unconscious and with no memory of his time away, through the Phantom Zone portal in an attempt to lure Clark into there for revenge.

* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'' voiced by [[Wentworth Miller]] in the first appearance and later by [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the second appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/07/16/sdcc-2012-kevin-smith-beware-the-batman-teen-titans-go-reveals-dc-nation-panel/ |title=MTV Geek – SDCC 2012: Kevin Smith Presents ‘Beware the Batman’ and ‘Teen Titans Go!’ Reveals at the DC Nation Panel |publisher=Geek-news.mtv.com |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> This version has long white hair worn in a ponytail and a patch over one eye. In the episode "True Colors", he appears as [[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Light]]'s new enforcer and intercepts an assasaination attempt on [[Black Manta]] by [[Sportsmaster]], who escapes onto a helicopter piloted by [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]. In the episode "The Fix", Black Manta enlists Deathstroke and [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]] to capture [[Miss Martian]] in order to restore [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad's]] mind. Deathstroke and Tigress interrupt a discussion between Miss Martian and [[Lagoon Boy]] at a junkyard. Deathstroke easily defeats Lagoon Boy and successfully captures Miss Martian. Black Manta then has Deathstroke monitor Miss Martian's procedure, prepared to set off an explosive charge in Miss Martian's inhibitor collar in case she tries anything. In the episode "The Hunt", Deathstroke infiltrates Warworld to steal the Key to Warworld upon being sent there by Lex Luthor. In the episode "Summit", Deathstroke is present at a meeting between The Light and The Reach, but was revealed to be Miss Martian in disguise. After the ensuring fight between The Light, The Reach and The Team, Nightwing is overheard congratulating Aqualad for defeating Deathstroke.

===Film===
* Slade Wilson appears in the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies|DC Universe Animated Original Movie]] ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' voiced by [[Bruce Davison]]. In the movie, this incarnation is a parallel universe counterpart of Deathstroke and the [[President of the United States]] in the world controlled by the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]. Although he still retains his white hair and eye-patch (except on his left eye as opposed to his right), he never pursued the path as an assassin but rather tries to work for the betterment of the American people through his political career. But he was a former soldier keeping in line with his mercenary counterpart's backstory but considered as a respectable war hero. He is also shown needing a [[cane]] for support, implying that he has health problems and never took the serum that would have given him his superhuman abilities. His daughter [[Rose Wilson]] publicly speaks out against the Crime Syndicate and was nearly assassinated by the [[Green Arrow|Archer]] but was saved by the [[Martian Manhunter]]. It was also heavily implied that Slade's wife was assassinated by [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]]. He is initially reluctant to wage war against the Syndicate due to his concerns for his daughter and the country's safety. However, after Ultraman's last threat and Rose's attempted murder, Wilson decides to strike back at the Syndicate with the Justice League's aid, along with that of his world's Lex Luthor, and personally leads the [[United States Marine Corps]] into the battle. After the Syndicate leaders' defeat, Slade orders the National Guard to work with law enforcement agencies to arrest the remaining members of the CSA.

* Deathstroke was going to appear in the straight-to-DVD film ''Teen Titans: The Judas Contract'', an adaptation of the Terra storyline of the same name from the comics (unrelated to the more youth-oriented, anime-like ''Teen Titans'' animated series). However, the film was put on hiatus.

* Ron Perlman reprises his role as Deathstroke in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|title=UPDATE: FLASHPOINT PARADOX Reveals Reverse Flash, Director|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/dc-animated-flashpoint-paradox-news.html|publisher=Newsarama}}</ref> In the distorted timeline of the 'Flashpoint' event, Deathstroke the Terminator is the captain of the ship, the ''Ravager''. He and [[Lex Luthor]] set out to find [[Aquaman]]'s 'Doomsday Device', but the ship is suddenly attacked by an Atlantean army, led by Aquaman. Deathstroke, with his superior fighting skills, cuts through hoards of Atlanteans before confronting Aquaman. He manages to overpower [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] and [[Kaldur'ahm]], but afterwards is presumably killed by [[Black Manta]]'s optic blasts.

===Video games===
* On August 20, 2008, [[Ed Boon]] announced Deathstroke as one of the DC villains who would appear in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5039348/wonder-woman-raiden-two-of-four-new-kombatants | title=Wonder Woman, Raiden Two of Four New Kombatants | last=McWhertor | first=Michael | work=[[Kotaku]] | date=August 20, 2008}}</ref> played by Chris Matthews and voiced by [[Patrick Seitz]]. He is a counterpart of [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]]. In the story, Deathstroke appears in Metropolis where he beheads a thug who paid him the money he owed Deathstroke late. Then Deathstroke is attacked and defeated by Flash. When in Gotham City, he attacks [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] (who is trying to hunt down Scorpion) seeing this new assassin as an enemy. Sub-Zero wins the battle, but does not bother finishing off Deathstroke fearing the essence of the Netherrealm that leads to Scorpion would become too weak to follow if he wasted any more time. Later, Deathstroke teams up with Lex Luthor and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. He helps the Joker try to take on [[Sonya Blade]] and [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]. The Joker fights Sonya while Deathstroke battles Kano. In the middle of his fight, Deathstroke is pushed aside by the Joker, who defeats Kano and turns on Deathstroke when the Combat Rage takes over Joker. Deathstroke's game ending has him realizing that other-worldy assassins are seen as unwelcome competition. As a caution, he creates an army of assassins in his image, becoming the leader of the "Deathstrike Clan" (the DC Universe's version of the Lin Kuei).

* Deathstroke appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' voiced by [[Tracy W. Bush]]. He is a member of the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]], and appears in multiple Instances and Alerts. During the Batman story quest line, he is sent by Joker to assassinate the [[Riddler]] for informing the heroes of the source of the Joker's new venom. In the Villain's campaign, he will join the player in a fight against [[Bruno Mannheim]] to steal the Bible of Crime. Players that use a Hero character will also encounter Deathstroke and [[Killer Croc]] on the Cape Carmine Lighthouse duo. In the Smallville alert, he appears as part of a Strike Force alongside [[Killer Frost]], [[Bizarro]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] sent to aid Villain players in their battle against [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].

* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'' voiced by [[Larry Grimm]].

* Deathstroke appears in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] version of ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]''.

* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' as a playable character,<ref>[http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/nailbiter111/news/?a=72404 Aquaman, Sinestro, Shazam & Doomsday Confirmed For INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US]</ref> voiced by [[J. G. Hertzler]].<ref>[http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=5152]</ref> In the mainstream universe, he is hired by Lex Luthor to spring Joker from [[Arkham Asylum]] but is defeated by Batman. In the alternate reality, Deathstroke was seen in [[Carol Ferris|Ferris Aircraft]] being tortured by the Regime's [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and Raven until [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] appears. Deathstroke escapes during the fight. Later on, he joins up with the Insurgency and helps the mainstream Cyborg into taking control of the Watchtower's teleportation system. In his game ending, he defeats Superman. As a result, new governments start to form to replace Superman's. With new governments comes new orders for assassinations, insurrections to cause and revolutions to support, too much for even Deathstroke to handle. Using his skills to hunt down the hidden Regime soldiers who worked for Superman, Deathstroke forms a clan of the world's most successful political assassins called the New Titans. A [[Red Son]]-in game exclusive skin was released as part of [[DLC]].

* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' voiced by [[Mark Rolston]].<ref>[http://www.inquisitr.com/610994/batman-arkham-origins-what-deathstroke-and-the-silver-age-could-mean ‘Batman: Arkham Origins’ What Deathstroke And The Silver Age Could Mean]</ref> He is among the eight assassins hired to kill Batman by The Joker. He appears in [[Penguin_(comics)|Penguin]]'s ship, the Final Offer, attacking Batman while he is interrogating Penguin. Despite proving a difficult opponent, even being capable of countering Batman's attacks, Deathstroke is ultimately defeated, with his remote claw gadget being confiscated by Batman. He is encountered later in the game, being incarcerated in Blackgate Prison during the Joker's uprising, still confined to his cell. He claims The Joker refused to release him because he was "afraid of him" and goes on to state that he has no interest in facing Batman again unless he is hired to do so. <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z62lEOcZukU]</ref>After completing the game, Deathstroke is once again shown in a special post credits scene in which [[Amanda Waller]] gives him a confidential file marked "Suicide Squad" and offers him the choice to stay in prison or work for her.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gA8cE-hAis]</ref> Deathstroke is also a playable character in the game's challenge maps, through a pre-order bonus and DLC, with two alternative skins inspired by the ''Judas Contract'' story arc and the video game ''Injustice: Gods Among Us''.
