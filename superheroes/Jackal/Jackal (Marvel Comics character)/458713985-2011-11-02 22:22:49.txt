The '''Jackal''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #129 (Feb. 1974), and was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Ross Andru]]. In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #148 (Sep. 1975), the identity of the Jackal was revealed to be '''Professor Miles Warren''', a [[supporting character]] of [[Spider-Man]], who first appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 (Dec. 1965), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

The character is the main [[antagonist]] of the controversial 1990s [[story arc]], the [[Clone Saga]], as well as the 2011 storyline, [[Spider-Island]].

==Fictional character biography==
Miles Warren was a [[professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30â€“33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>  There, he met [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31</ref> During his tenure there, Warren secretly fell in love with the much younger Stacy.  After Stacy was murdered by the original [[Green Goblin]], Warren swore vengeance on Spider-Man, falsely believing it was the superhero who caused her death,{{Issue|date=June 2011}} not realizing that the Green Goblin had the motives to kill her. Gwen's death drove Warren into depression and despair, which drove him further into insanity as a mad geneticist who eventually became the Jackal. Miles also had a brother named Raymond, who was a science teacher at Peter Parker's high school and introduced Peter to Miles.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #25 (July 1997)</ref> 

===Early career===
It was also revealed that Miles had previously been an assistant of the [[High Evolutionary]] at Wundagore Mountain after he earned his Ph.D in biochemistry. Warren had assisted the High Evolutionary in experiments that involved turning animals into humans and vice-versa. There was conflict between Warren and the Evolutionary because Warren had succeeded "New Men" who looked practically human, whereas the Evolutionary was not able to. Eventually Warren had evolved a jackal that exhibited a Jekyll-Hyde personality. When the test subject escaped, the Evolutionary had banished Warren from Wundagore. Warren continued his research and eventually settled down a woman named Monica who bore him two small children, who were all killed in what was originally believed to be a car crash; however, later revealed to be the result of an assault by his highly evolved Man-Jackal, envious of his creator.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1 (1995)</ref>.

===Origin of the Jackal===
The day after the death of Gwen Stacy, Warren's lab assistant, Anthony Serba, revealed that he had successfully cloned a frog using their Research technology. Warren secretly gave Serba tissue samples of Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker, stating to Serba these were only rat cells. Sometime later, Serba confronts Warren, stating that the tissue samples he was asked to clone were indeed human and that they must destroyed immediately.  Panicking, Warren attempts to cover Serba's mouth to shut him up, accidentally suffocating him. Unable to accept responsibility for his action, Warren resorts to his alter ego dubbing himself "The Jackal", which he took after overhearing a professor describing a [[jackal]] as a "cowardly predator". This also was something Warren further develops his alter ego by fashioning a green suit and training himself athletically.<ref name="ASM149">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149</ref> It was later revealed that Kaine was the first successful attempt at cloning Peter Parker, despite suffering from a slow cloning degeneration and having regenerative abilities to elude death several times.<ref name="S-I Deadly">''Spider-Island: Deadly Foes''</ref>

The Jackal's hatred for Spider-Man manifested by his belief that he is solely responsible for allowing Gwen Stacy, whom he loved, to die at the hands of the Green Goblin. He initially harasses Spider-Man numerous times, setting him up against various other adversaries and manipulating these Spider-Man foes into his plans. Warren allied himself with the [[Punisher]] against Spider-Man, but his alliance with the Punisher was quickly dissolved when it was revealed that Jackal was manipulating him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129</ref> Jackal's next attempts were to incite a gang war between [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130</ref> Later, the Jackal equipped wrestler Maxwell Markham with the costume and powerful exoskeleton of the [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]] and sent him to assassinate newspaper publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #139</ref> The Jackal then held Peter Parker hostage in a scheme to trap Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #140</ref> Sometime after, he became aware of Spider-Man's identity and set out in his next major agenda.

Meanwhile, his early cloning experiments had a variation of results-- out of his numerous attempts to clone Peter Parker, only one was a perfect copy of the original. He also created two clones of himself, one a direct copy, the other a modified clone harboring the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] virus who would surface later. His most prized creation, however, was what he perceived was a perfect copy of Gwen Stacy. Realizing the end of his plan was near, the Jackal battled Spider-Man with the assistance of the original [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Anton Miguel Rodriguez|Tarantula]]. The Jackal beat and drugged Spider-Man unconscious and transported him to [[Shea Stadium]], where he was set to do battle with the perfect Spider-Man clone while holding Daily Bugle reporter Ned Leeds hostage. <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #147</ref> The two Spider-Men fought, until the Gwen Stacy clone tore off the Jackal's mask and confronted him on his crimes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #148</ref> A subsequent explosion of a bomb the Jackal had placed killed the Jackal and apparently the Spider-Man clone.<ref name="ASM149"/>

===Clone Saga===
It was much later revealed that the clone of Peter had survived the explosion and gone into hiding and creating the alias identify Ben Reilly- Peter's uncle's first name and aunt's maiden name. The Jackal who died at Shea Stadium was later revealed to be a clone. Nearly 5 years later since the battle at Shea Stadium, another Jackal clone would marry the original Gwen Stacy clone and would live under the assumed names Warren and Gwen Miles. This clone of Warren eventually died of the clone degeneration that afflicted most of the clones created by the Jackal. Jackal resurfaced where his experiments mutated his own DNA and give himself attributes of an actual Jackal. Prior to these events, the Jackal's physical abilities had merely been the result of training rather than any superhuman powers.

Reilly returns years later to [[New York City]], allied himself with Spider-Man, and became the [[Scarlet Spider]]. The Jackal also returned to unleash his clone army <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (Mar. 1995)</ref> and convinced both Parker and Reilly that Reilly was the real Peter Parker and that the other man was the clone, respectively. Jackal created a number of other Peter Parker clones who came into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider, and [[Kaine]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}} The Jackal clone who was thought to have died at Shea Stadium was revealed to have survived and married the Gwen Stacy clone under an assumed name.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #125</ref> Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones he could control, was killed falling off a tall building while trying to save the Gwen clone.<ref>''Maximum Clonage Omega'' (July 1995)</ref>

Near the end of the Clone Saga it was revealed that the Jackal and the other major players of the Clone Saga had unknowingly been duped by Norman Osborn, the man who originally killed Gwen Stacy. The Jackal and various others (including [[Kaine]]) had been tricked into thinking Ben Reilly was the original and that Peter Parker was the clone. All of the Jackal's machinations during the Clone Saga were influenced by his incorrect assertion that he knew who the real Peter Parker was.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Osborn Journals''</ref>

===Spider-Island===
Warren returns in the "Infestation" back-up feature of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', unleashing genetically-engineered bed bugs to pass on Spider-Man-like powers to thousands of citizens in Manhattan, building up to the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659-660</ref> It is later revealed that he achieved this through the aid of several human clones of himself, and funding from a mysterious female benefactor, later revealed as the Queen.<ref name="ASM668">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #668</ref> Although the bed bugs had later died, the powers Warren gave to New Yorkers was actually airborne to infect the world to create a new race of Homo-Arachnus, as part of the Queen's plan to overtake the Great Web of Life.

Jackal has also enlisted the aid of a regenerated Kaine after his death at the hands of the Kravens<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635-636</ref> in Grim Hunt which Warren had mutated into his man-spider henchman, Tarantula.<ref name="S-I Deadly"/><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #666</ref> It was revealed that the Gwen Stacy clone introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 was only the Jackal's second clone of Gwen Stacy. Abby-L the first attempt to clone Gwen Stacy was a flawed clone with the degenerative debilities similar that Kaine was a flawed clone of Peter Parker. Before this seemingly perfect copy of Gwen died at the hands of Abby-L, it was revealed she actually had some degeneration on her hand, that may suspect that she was not perfect after all. Abby-L was also infected with the Carrion virus and had the came abilities of Carrion. Abby-L was manipulated by the Queen into killing the other Gwen clone who was living in London under the alias Joyce Delaney and coming into conflict with Jackal and Kaine.<ref name="S-I Deadly"/>

To cause further chaos, the Jackal had his own motives to manipulate various gang leaders to adorn duplicate Spider-Man costumes to cause chaos in the city.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #667</ref> While experimenting with the Spider-King (who was a captured [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] at the hands of the Queen) by injecting him with various embryo spiders to hatch outside of New York City Quarantine to spread the Infestation on a global scale.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man" #670>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #670</ref> The Jackal reveals that he still knows Spider-Man's true identity despite the [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Psychic blindspot|world-wide mind wipe]] of that information by the rest of the world.<ref name="ASM668"/> After a cure created by Reed Richards and Horizon Labs using Anti-Venom's symbiotic antibodies, when Warren assured the Queen that no cure was possible, she seemingly killed Warren realized her powers were amplified due to a frequency to return Spider-Man's spider-sense, giving her the power of a god. <ref name="Amazing Spider-Man" #670/> It appeared that as though the original Jackal was killed by the Queen; however, in the aftermath of Spider-Island it was revealed that the Jackal who died was one of the clones, and the real Jackal had kept his distance the entire time.  Jackal revealed this to his surviving Miles Warren clones anticipating the outcome in order to gain a sample of a husk of Spider-God DNA recognizing his success when getting his hands on Peter Parker's DNA.  Unbeknownst to the Avengers and Spider-Man, the Jackal was ordering the clean-up crew to obtaining the slain Queen's DNA.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #673 </ref>

===Other===
Prior to the death of the Warren clone at Shea Stadium,<ref name="ASM149"/> he had created a clone of himself. The clone remained in stasis within a cloning casket that malfunctioned and super-aged the clone beyond death. Eventually, it emerged and became known as Carrion that wielded power and had no conscience for its actions. He was the first carrier of the Carrion virus, which Warren designed to destroy humanity. Carrion contained all Warren's memories which contained within his RNA, that included his hatred and knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity. Carrion wielded the power to create a Red Dust that would spread as pestilence as well as his touch that would incapacitate or even cause organic matter to just degenerate.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #28</ref> The original Carrion intended to kill Spider-Man with a spider-amoeba, but failed as Carrion was absorbed by the amoeba engulfed in flames the ensued from his battle.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #31 </ref><ref>http://spiderfan.org/characters/carrion1.html</ref>

Much later, fellow ESU rival, Malcolm McBride, has stumbled across Warren's old lair where he was infected with a strain of the Carrion virus and becoming the second incarnation of Carrion. The virus allowed McBride to become endowed with the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity; however, was unsure whether he was Dr. Warren's first clone or Malcolm McBride <ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #149</ref>. Eventually, McBride teamed with the likes of Demogoblin and Carnage, but was later cured of his condition and incarcerated in Ravencroft Asylum.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #393</ref>

However, another clone of Miles Warren later appeared, who was even further genetically altered to the point where he frequently displays animalistic tendencies and his body is always cold, causing him to wear a thick fur coat even in the hottest weather. He became a crime lord calling himself "The Professor" and allied himself with Hammerhead, but the two of them eventually went to jail.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] Vs. [[Punisher]]''</ref>

A man dressed as the Jackal once attacked Alpha Flight and claimed to be Miles Warren's son.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #144</ref>

When Kaine betrays Jackal and leads Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider to his lair, all three are captured.  Jackal then reveals his plan to create an army of Spider-Clones to take over the world and clone Gwen Stacy.  The clones prove unstable, however, and Jackal comes to the conclusion that Ben is the original.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Miles Warren appears in the two-part ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "The Return of Hydro-Man" voiced by [[Jonathan Harris]]. Here, Warren is a scientist whose cloning experiments were banned by the government. He continued his experiments in secret with help from the crime lord [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]] (whom he kept anonymous). Warren's clones, however, were unsuccessful. Their cells would not hold together, and they disintegrated into nothing. Interested in [[Hydro-Man]] and his ability to change his molecules into water, Warren finds a sample of Hydro-Man's DNA at the scene where he evaporated and creates a clone of the latter. Like the real Hydro-Man, the clone loved [[Mary Jane Watson]] (who was believed dead) and demanded that Warren creates a clone of her. In the end, the clones of Hydro-Man and Mary Jane Watson degenerate, though, Warren is able to steal a sample of Spider-Man's DNA (a piece of his costume), with interest to clone him. With part of his underwater lab trashed, he contacted [[Alistair Smythe]] to have Silvermane's men repair it. In an alternate universe, Warren has managed to create a Spider-Man clone. The clone had escaped and became [[Ben Reilly]]. His presence in this universe caused the real Peter Parker to willingly join with the carnage-symbiote to become [[Spider-Carnage]].

* Miles Warren first appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' episode "Blueprints" voiced by [[Brian George]]. In this incarnation, Miles is much younger and East Indian. Warren, along with his assistant [[Debra Whitman]], joins his brother Aaron, [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]], and Dr. Martha Connors in scientific research at the ESU labs with a grant from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Warren bases his genetic research on Curt's work with lizard DNA, but Curt discourages his work. When [[Kraven the Hunter]] tracks down Spider-Man at ESU labs, Warren offers to alter Kraven's genetic material for a large sum of money. Kraven agrees, and Warren uses the same procedure that caused Curt to become the Lizard to mutate Kraven into a lion-like creature (with elements of cheetah and leopard thrown in). After [[Eddie Brock]] steals a vial of Curt's gene cleanser, Miles talks to the college board and plots to take away Connors' control of the lab for himself. In the episode "Subtext", he is seen in an old rundown police station which happens to be another one of Norman Osborn's laboratories. Here he uses Mark Allan, [[Liz Allan]]'s brother as an upgraded experiment from [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]]' previous [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] experiment. He then injects a thermal suit into Mark which turned him into [[Molten Man]]. Dr. Warren then convinces Mark that the suit can only be controlled by sheer will when actually it can only be controlled by remote. At the end of the episode, Connors discovers Warren's research, and threatens to tell the school board. However, Warren retaliates by threatening to inform them of his own Lizard experiments, and reveal how his human limb regeneration project turned him into The Lizard.

===Video games===
* Jackal appears in the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'' voiced by [[Greg Baldwin]]. He is in alliance with [[Spencer Smythe]] and is his [[double agent]] when Spider-Man encounters Jackal on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]]. After being defeated, Jackal gives Spider-Man a serum that will enhance his symbiotic suit before he gets away. Jackal later steals the Sonic Emitter from the top of Fisk Tower and gets away as Spencer Smythe unleashes [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] on Spider-Man. Spider-Man encounters him in Central Park where he has made modifications to the Sonic Emitter so that he can control the symbiotes. Spider-Man defeats him and programs the Sonic Emitter to destroy the symbiotes.
