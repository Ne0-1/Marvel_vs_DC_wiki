The character is the main [[antagonist]] of the controversial 1990s [[story arc]], the [[Clone Saga]].

==Fictional character biography==
Miles Warren was a [[professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | date = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30â€“33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>  There, he met [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #31</ref> Warren secretly fell in love with the much younger Stacy, and after she was killed by the original [[Green Goblin]], Warren swore vengeance on Spider-Man, falsely believing it was he who caused her death. After his lab assistant, Anthony Serba, revealed that he had successfully cloned a frog, Warren gave Serba tissue samples taken from Gwen, telling him that they were rat cells. Sometime later, Serba confronts Warren, telling him that the clones are human and have to be destroyed immediately. Panicking, Warren covers Serba's mouth to shut him up, accidentally suffocated him. Unable to accept responsibility for his action, Warren creates an alter ego he calls "The Jackal", which he took after overhearing a professor describing a [[jackal]] as a "cowardly predator". Warren further develops his alter ego by fashioning a green suit and training himself athletically. 

The Jackal harasses Spider-Man numerous times, setting him against various other adversaries. He allied himself with the [[Punisher]] against Spider-Man, but his alliance with the Punisher was quickly dissolved.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #129</ref> He then attempts to incite a gang war between [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #130</ref> The Jackal equipped wrestler Maxwell Markham with the costume and powerful exoskeleton of the [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]] and sent him to assassinate newspaper publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #139</ref> The Jackal then held Peter Parker hostage in a scheme to trap Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #140</ref>

Meanwhile, his cloning experiments had varying results; out of numerous Spider-Man clones he created, only one was a perfect copy of the original. He also created two clones of himself, one a direct copy, the other a modified clone harboring the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] virus. His most prized creation however was a perfect copy of Gwen Stacy. Realizing the end of his plan was near, the Jackal went out against Spider-Man. With the assistance of the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Anton Miguel Rodriguez|Tarantula]], the Jackal beat Spider-Man unconscious and transported him to [[Shea Stadium]], along with the Spider-Man clone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #147</ref> The two Spider-Men fought, until the Gwen Stacy clone tore off the Jackal's mask and confronted him on his crimes.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #148</ref> A subsequent explosion of a bomb the Jackal had placed killed the Jackal and apparently the Spider-Man clone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #149</ref>

It was much later revealed that the clone of Peter had survived the explosion and gone into hiding. The Jackal who died at Shea stadium was also a clone. Many months later another Jackal clone would marry the Gwen Stacy clone and they would live under the assumed names Warren and Gwen Miles. This clone of Warren died of the clone degeneration that afflicted most of the clones created by the Jackal.  Another  Jackal clone became the first carrier of the Carrion virus; which Warren designed.  He also uses his experiments to mutate his own DNA and give himself attributes of an actual Jackal; prior to these events, the Jackal's physical abilities had merely been the result of training rather than any superhuman powers.

The Peter Parker clone, unaware that the Jackal is alive, takes the name [[Ben Reilly]], and goes into exile. He returns years later to [[New York City]], allied himself with Spider-Man, and became the [[Scarlet Spider]]. The Jackal returned at this point <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #399, March, 1995</ref> and convinced both Parker and Reilly that Reilly was the real Peter Parker and that the other man was the clone, and created a number of other Peter Parker clones who came into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider, and [[Kaine]]. Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones he could control, was killed falling off a tall building while trying to save the Gwen clone. <ref>''Maximum Clonage Omega'', July, 1995</ref>

However, another clone of Miles Warren has appeared, who was even further genetically altered to the point where he frequently displays animalistic tendencies and his body is always cold, causing him to wear a thick fur coat even in the hottest weather. He became a crime-lord calling himself "The Professor" and allied himself with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], but the two of them eventually went to jail.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] Vs. [[Punisher]]''</ref>

Near the end of the Clone Saga it was revealed that the Jackal and the other major players of the Clone Saga had unknowingly been duped by Norman Osborn; the man who originally killed Gwen Stacy. The Jackal and various others (including [[Kaine]]) had been tricked into thinking Ben Reilly was the original and that Peter Parker was the clone. All of the Jackal's machinations during the Clone Saga were influenced by his incorrect assertion that he knew who the real Peter Parker was.

It was also revealed that Miles had previously been an assistant of the High Evolutionary. He married a woman named Monica who bore him two small children and that they were killed in what was originally believed to be a car crash but was later revealed to be the result of an attack by a highly evolved Jackal created via the High Evolutionary's machines. 

Miles had a brother who was a science teacher at Peter's High School (revealed in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man''). This brother, named Aaron Warren, appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectaular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Brian George]].

==Other versions==

However, as of now, he had no involvement in the Clone Saga in this continuity and has yet to make any more appearances.

Interested in [[Hydro-Man]] and his ability to change his molecules into water, Warren finds a sample of Hydro-Man's DNA and creates a clone of the latter. But like the real Hydro-Man, the clone loved [[Mary Jane Watson]], who was believed dead, and demanded that Warren creates a clone of her. In the end, the clones of Hydro-Man and Mary Jane Watson degenerates, though, Warren is able to steal a sample of Spider-Man's DNA (a piece of his costume), with interest to clone him.

Jackal later steals the Sonic Emitter from the top of Fisk Tower and gets away as Spencer Smythe unleashes Black Cat on Spider-Man. Spider-Man encounters him in Central Park where he has made modifications to the Sonic Emitter so that he can control the symbiotes. Spider-Man defeats him and programs the Sonic Emitter to destroy the symbiotes.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}
