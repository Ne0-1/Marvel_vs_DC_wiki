The '''Jackal''' (Miles Warren) is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  He first appeared as Miles Warren in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31, and as the Jackal in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #129. He is primarily known for his role in the [[first appearance]] of the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] and in the [[Clone Saga]].

==Character biography==
The Jackal was a mutagenically altered human professor named Miles Warren. He experimented with human cloning and perfected a way to make clones and mutagenically enhance them. In order to perfect his technology the professor conducted unethical experiments and created human beings merely as fodder to be destroyed if the results were not to his liking. He desired to make clones of Spider-Man in order to create a super army, and successfully made one clone and one imperfect clone. He also utilized his radically advanced knowledge of genetics to mutagenically enhance his own body. 
===Origin===
Prof. Miles Warren was once a professor of [[biochemistry]] at [[Empire State University]].  At some point, he studied [[genetics]] under the tutelage of the [[High Evolutionary]], but was expelled from the Evolutionary's headquarters when he proved to be unstable.  He received further training and equipment from [[Maelstrom (comics) | Maelstrom]].  Warren fell in love with one of his students, [[Gwen Stacy]], who was the girlfriend of Peter Parker (Spider-Man).  After Gwen was killed by the original [[Green Goblin]], Warren became completely insane, developing the personality of the Jackal.  In his first appearance as the Jackal, he attempted to manipulate the [[Punisher]] into killing Spider-Man, but when the Punisher learned of the Jackal's deception, he turned against Warren.

The Jackal - with the aid of a [[Scrier]], working for the [[Green Goblin]] - subsequently worked to create [[cloning|clone]]s of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. However, his first apparently successful attempt quickly began to show signs of degeneration. ''It was much later revealed that this clone managed to escape before Warren could kill him, and would come to be known as [[Kaine]].'' Warren then refined the process, and although several more failures resulted, he eventually successfully created clones of Gwen, then Peter, who did not suffer from the tell-tale degeneration. The Parker clone and the Jackal were both apparently killed in battle with Spider-Man in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #149 (October, 1975).

===Clone saga===
Almost twenty (real time) years later, it was revealed that both men had survived the explosion and went into hiding. However, in the intervening years a clone of Miles Warren appeared, and actually married the Gwen Stacy clone.  The Jackal's research was also used to create the several incarnations of the villain [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], one of whom was thought to be another clone of the Jackal. 

The Peter Parker clone, unaware that the Jackal lived, took the name [[Ben Reilly]], and went into exile. Years later, he returned to [[New York City]], allied himself with Spider-Man, and became the [[Scarlet Spider]].  The Jackal returned at this point (''Amazing Spider-Man'' #399, March, 1995) and convinced both Parker and Reilly that Reilly was the real Peter Parker and that the other man was the clone, and created a number of other Peter Parker clones who came into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider, and Kaine. Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones he could control, was killed falling off a tall building while trying to save the Gwen clone, who was saved by Spider-Man (''Maximimum Clonage Omega'', July, 1995).

Shortly after, Parker retired to spend more time with his pregnant wife, [[Mary Jane Watson-Parker]], and Ben Reilly briefly replaced him as Spider-Man, until he died at the hands of the Green Goblin, finally revealing in the process that Parker was and always had been the original Spider-Man (''Peter Parker, Spider-Man'' #75, June, 1996).

In the 2005 limited series ''[[Daredevil]] Vs. [[Punisher]]'' The Jackal was shown to be alive once again, although it was unclear whether this was the orignal Jackal, another clone of Warren, or an unrelated character who assumed the Jackal persona.

==Powers and abilities==
The Jackal had been mutagenically enhanced by combining the genetic material of an actual jackal with his own. As a result he had enhanced strength; he could lift somewhere in the range of 900 pounds to 2 tons. His agility and speed were similarly augmented. Jackel also had razor sharp claws and teeth. 

The Jackal was a genius in the fields of genetics and biochemistry and a pioneer in the field of cloning. His knowledge of cloning was at least a century ahead of what is known to conventional science. The Jackal was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. When he gained his enhanced abilities he was able to defeat Spider-Man in more than one physical confrontation.
