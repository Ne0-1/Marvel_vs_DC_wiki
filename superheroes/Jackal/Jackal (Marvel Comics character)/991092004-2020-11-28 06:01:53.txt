'''Jackal''' ('''Miles Warren''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is commonly depicted as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. A scientist researching genetics and biochemistry and former [[professor]] at [[Empire State University]] who developed an unhealthy [[limerence]] to [[Gwen Stacy]], Warren created his Jackal alter ego to conceal his identity by donning a green suit and gauntlents with claw-like razors, and trained in [[martial arts]] while seeking revenge towards Spider-Man, whom he blamed for [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|Gwen's death]]. He is best known for mastering the [[cloning]] technology and creating various clones of Spider-Man (such as [[Ben Reilly]] and [[Kaine Parker]]) during the "[[Clone Saga]]". Jackal is also largely responsible for the events of "[[Spider-Island]]". Other characters have assumed the Jackal alias in comics over the years. 

The character has appeared in several media adaptations over the years, including animated series and video games. [[IGN]] ranked him as Spider-Man's 17th greatest enemy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|website=IGN}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The character first appears in [[The Amazing Spider-Man 129|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129]] (February 1974), and was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Ross Andru]].<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 72|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Gerry Conway and artist Ross Andru introduced two major new characters to Spider-Man's world and the Marvel Universe in this self-contained issue.

Prior to his Jackal reintroduction, his appearances were essentially limited to the occasional cameo in which he acts as simple background to Spider-Man's civilian life as a college student.

When named at all in these early appearances, he is called only "Professor Warren". A "Mister Warren" had previously appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #8 (January 1964) but he is a high school science teacher rather than a college professor, and is physically very distinct from Miles Warren. Despite this, Conway has said it was always his interpretation that "Mister Warren", "Professor Warren", and Professor Miles Warren/Jackal were the same character.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 12|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

The character was featured in the controversial 1990s [[Clone Saga]] [[story arc]], the 2011 storyline [[Spider-Island]], and the 2016 storyline [[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]].

==Fictional character biography==
Miles Warren was a [[professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30–33 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> There, he meets [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> During his tenure there, Warren becomes secretly infatuated with the much younger Gwen to the point of [[Obsessive love|obsession]] and jealousy of Parker. After Gwen is [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|murdered]] by the Green Goblin, Warren swears vengeance on Spider-Man, since it was reported that it was Spider-Man who killed Gwen.<ref name="ASM149">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gwen's death drives Warren into depression, despair, and insanity as a mad geneticist who eventually turns into the Jackal. Miles also has a brother, [[Raymond Warren (comics)|Raymond]], a science teacher at Midtown High School.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #25 (July 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Early career===
Miles is an assistant of the [[High Evolutionary]] at Wundagore Mountain after earning his Ph.D in biochemistry. Warren assists the High Evolutionary in experiments that involve turning animals into humans and vice versa. There is conflict between Warren and the High Evolutionary because Warren succeeds in creating "New Men" who looked practically human, whereas the High Evolutionary is not able to. Eventually, Warren evolves a jackal that exhibits a [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Jekyll and Hyde personality]]. When the test subject escapes, the High Evolutionary banishes Warren from Wundagore. Warren continues his research and eventually settles down with a woman named Monica who bears him two children who are all killed in what was originally believed to be a car crash; however, it is later revealed to be an assault by his highly evolved Man-Jackal envious of his creator.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The Jackal's origin===
The day after Gwen's death, Warren's lab assistant Anthony Serba reveals successfully cloning a frog using their research technology. Warren gives Serba tissue samples of Gwen and Peter, telling Serba it's of rat cells. Sometime later, Serba confronts Warren, stating that the clones are human and must be destroyed immediately. Panicking, Warren attempts to cover Serba's mouth to shut up, accidentally suffocating Serba. Unable to accept responsibility for his actions, Warren develops a second personality to carry the weight of his misdeeds dubbed "The Jackal". He further develops his alter ego by fashioning a green suit and gauntlets with sharp, claw-like razors on each finger, and by training himself athletically.<ref name="ASM149"/> [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] is the first successful clone of Peter despite suffering from a slow cloning degeneration and having regenerative abilities to elude death several times.<ref name="S-I Deadly">''Spider-Island: Deadly Foes''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Jackal's hatred for Spider-Man manifests in his belief that Spider-Man is solely responsible for allowing Gwen, whom he loved, to die at the Goblin's hands. He harasses Spider-Man numerous times, setting Spider-Man up against other adversaries. Warren allies himself with the [[Punisher]] against Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal next attempts to incite a gang war between [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he equips wrestler Maxwell Markham with the [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]] costume and powerful exoskeleton to assassinate newspaper publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal then holds Parker hostage in a scheme to trap Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #140. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sometime after, he learns Spider-Man's identity.

Out of his numerous attempts to create clones of Peter, only one is a perfect copy of the original. He also creates two clones of himself, one a direct copy and the other a modified clone harboring the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] virus. The Jackal helps the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Anton Miguel Rodriguez|Tarantula]] (Anton Miguel Rodriguez) escape prison, and the two become partners.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #147. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal captures Spider-Man, but promptly lets go after proving that Spider-Man is no match for the Jackal in a fair fight. He then lures his nemesis to [[Shea Stadium]] and manipulates into battling his perfect clone of Peter by binding ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' reporter [[Ned Leeds]] to a bomb that only the original Spider-Man can disarm. But when a clone of Gwen tears off the Jackal's mask and confronts him on his crimes, Warren finally accepts responsibility for his actions. He attempts to correct his wrongdoings by freeing Leeds, only to be caught in the bomb's explosion.<ref name="ASM149"/>

===Clone Saga===
[[File:Jackal (Miles Warren - circa 1994).jpg|thumb|upright|The Jackal as he appeared throughout the "[[Clone Saga]]". Interior art of ''Spider-Man: The Jackal Files'' #1 (August 1994). Art by Dan Lawlis.]]
During the "[[Clone Saga]]", it was much later revealed that the clone of Peter had survived the explosion and gone into hiding under the alias of [[Ben Reilly]], and the Jackal who died at Shea Stadium was later revealed to be a clone. Nearly five years later, another clone of Jackal would marry the original clone of Gwen and the two would live under the assumed names Warren Miles and Gwen Miles. This clone of Warren eventually died of the clone degeneration that afflicted most of the Jackal's clones. The real Jackal resurfaced, where his experiments mutated his own DNA and give himself an actual jackal's attributes;{{issue|date=February 2014}} his physical abilities had previously been the result of training rather than any superhuman powers.

When Reilly returns years later to [[New York City]] as the Scarlet Spider and allied with Spider-Man, the Jackal also returned to unleash his clone army<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (Mar. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> and convinced both Parker and Reilly that Reilly was the real individual and that the other man was the clone respectively. The Jackal created a number of clones of Peter who came into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider, and Kaine.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} The clone of Jackal who was thought to have died at Shea Stadium was revealed to have survived and married the clone of Gwen under an assumed name.<ref name="Web of Spider-Man #125">''Web of Spider-Man'' #125. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones that he could control, was killed falling off a tall building while trying to save the clone of Gwen.<ref>''Maximum Clonage Omega'' (July 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

It was ultimately revealed that the Jackal and this storyline's other major players had unknowingly been duped by [[Norman Osborn]]. The Jackal and various others (including Kaine) had been tricked into thinking that Reilly was the original and that Peter was the clone. All of the Jackal's machinations were influenced by his incorrect assertion that he knew who the real Peter was.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Osborn Journals''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Spider-Island===
The Jackal later returned in the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, being further genetically altered to the point where he frequently displayed animalistic tendencies. His body is always cold, requiring him to wear a thick fur coat even in the hottest weather. He's now a crime lord calling himself "The Professor", and allied himself with Hammerhead but the two eventually went to jail.<ref name="Daredevil Vs. Punisher">''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] Vs. Punisher''. Marvel Comics.</ref> Warren returns in the "Infestation" back-up feature of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', unleashing genetically-engineered bedbugs to pass on Spider-like abilities to thousands of citizens in Manhattan.<ref name=TASM#659-660>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659-660. Marvel Comics.</ref> He achieved this through the aid of several human clones of himself, and funding from [[Queen (Marvel Comics)|Adriana Soria]].<ref name="ASM668">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #668.

Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal has also enlisted the aid of his mutated henchman Tarantula.<ref name="S-I Deadly"/><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #666. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was revealed that the clone of Gwen introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 was only Abby-L (Gwen's second clone and the first cloning attempt) was a flawed clone with degenerative debilities. Before this seemingly perfect copy of Gwen died at Abby-L's hands, it was revealed she actually had some degeneration on her hand, suggesting that she was not perfect after all. Abby-L was also infected with the Carrion virus and had Carrion's same abilities. Abby-L was manipulated into killing the other clone of Gwen who was living in London under the alias Joyce Delaney, and coming into conflict with the Jackal and Kaine.<ref name="S-I Deadly"/> With his own ulterior motives, the Jackal manipulated various gang leaders into adorning duplicate costumes of Spider-Man to cause chaos in New York City.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #667</ref> While experimenting with the [[Spider King]] by injecting with various embryo spiders to hatch outside of New York City quarantine to spread the Infestation on a global scale.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #670">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #670. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal reveals that he still knows Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man: One More Day|true identity]] despite the [[One Moment in Time (comics)|worldwide mindwipe]] to the rest of the world.<ref name="ASM668"/> After a cure was created by [[Mister Fantastic]] and Horizon Labs using [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]]'s antibodies, Warren assured Soria that no cure was possible to which Soria killed Warren after realizing Soria's powers were amplified due to a frequency that returned Spider-Man's spider-sense into the god-like Spider Queen.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #670"/> The aftermath revealed that the one who died was a clone and the real Jackal had kept his distance the entire time, revealing this to his former human self's surviving clones, anticipating the outcome and gaining a sample of his slain female co-conspirator's DNA, recognizing his success in obtaining DNA unbeknownst to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #673. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It's later revealed that the Jackal has been monitoring Peter's accidental creation of [[Alpha (Marvel Comics)|Alpha]], and has set his sights on Spider-Man's new protege.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #692-693">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #692-693. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal resurfaces accompanied by his cloned mutated human-spider hybrids of Spider Queen and is bent on harvesting Alpha's powers for himself in order to clone a race of Alpha males. But his plans fail as the Alpha energy cannot be cloned, resulting in a collection of powerless, near-mindless copies of Alpha, all of which are destroyed when the enraged Alpha breaks free. It was revealed that the two versions of Jackal that Spider-Man and Alpha fought were also clones.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #692. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Superior Spider-Man era===
When Otto Octavius's mind possesses Spider-Man's body, the [[X-Men]] battles a 30&nbsp;ft. human-spider hybrid attacking New York which turns out to be a human created by the Jackal using [[Mister Sinister]]'s works.<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man #16">''Avenging Spider-Man'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal later attacks the [[Superior Spider-Man]] and the new Scarlet Spider with some mutant-powered spider-clones.<ref name="Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #2">''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Superior Spider-Man kills the clones by destroying the Jackal's hideout, but the Jackal escapes. It is revealed that he kept samples of Scarlet Spider's DNA. The Jackal tells Carrion that he is prepared to develop Spidercide 2.0.<ref name="Scarlet Spider #20">''Scarlet Spider'' (vol. 2) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy===
Ben's dissolved remains (after death at the Goblin's hands) were collected by the Jackal and was resurrected thanks to a new cloning process. However, the Jackal found problems with the cellular degradation. He had Ben killed 26 more times, all of which had Ben's life (and most of Peter's) flash before his eyes. The ordeal of repeated death caused Ben to become mentally unbalanced and morally ambiguous, due to the trauma and very soul being damaged from being removed and replaced over and over.<ref>''Ben Reily: Scarlet Spider'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ben eventually breaks free and knocks out the Jackal. After improving Warren's formula, Ben makes clones of Miles and persuades the Jackal that ''he'' is a clone, thereby making it nearly impossible to tell who is the real one. Now free with a number of clone of Miles as servants, Ben becomes the new Jackal during the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline and is determined to repay the people who have heavily influenced Ben's and Peter's lives with the Jackal's technology to make sure that no one has to suffer again and that those who have can become whole, and even does this by establishing New U Technologies.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #22">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man activates the Webware to stabilize the human and clone cells all across the world that were in danger of succumbing to clone degradation, the various clone of Miles melt as Ben fights Doctor Octopus. The so-called clone that does not melt realizes that he ''is'' the true Warren and vows to have revenge on Ben as the true Jackal. Ben returns to a safe-house and finds Miles in his Jackal outfit waiting in the living room. The Jackal proceeds to burn Ben's safe-house down and engages in one final battle. Ben defeats the Jackal and leaves him in the burning house to die.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 4) #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Jackal however, survived the fire and targeted the neural net that was built by Dr. Yesenia Rosario when the woman was doing a presentation of it at Empire State University. The Jackal was defeated by Spider-Man and [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] as Dr. Rosario destroys her own invention by setting it to self-destruct.<ref>''Marvel Team Up'' (vol. 4) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He later surfaced in the Empire State University once more, under the guise of "Professor Guarinus" and is shocked to bump into a [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|super-powered counterpart of Gwen Stacy]] from another universe, who had recently enrolled in this universe's ESU.<ref>''Ghost-Spider'' #1</ref> He injected himself with actual jackal DNA, allowing himself to transform into looking exactly like his iconic green costume but for real.<ref>''Ghost-Spider'' #2</ref> He recruited another new student, Benji, to befriend Gwen in exchange for the possibility of great power if she does her job well and while Benji is able to tell Miles that Gwen is a costumed hero from another world, she somehow had failed Warren and was punished for it.<ref>''Ghost-Spider'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Prior to his regeneration, Miles Warren is a genius in the fields of biochemistry, genetics and cloning, and is a talented gymnast and martial artist. The Jackal later spliced his genes with the genetics of a jackal, having the strength, speed and agility amplified to superhuman levels. Having an in-depth knowledge of Peter Parker resulted by cloning him repeatedly, the Jackal is unaffected by the [[Spider-Man: One More Day|worldwide mind purging]] of Spider-Man's identity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Copies of Jackal==
Prior to the death of the Warren clone at Shea Stadium,<ref name="ASM149"/> he had created a clone of himself. The clone remained in stasis within a cloning casket that malfunctioned and super-aged the clone beyond death. Eventually, it emerged and became known as Carrion that wielded power and had no conscience for its actions. He was the first carrier of the Carrion virus, which Warren designed to destroy humanity. Carrion contained all Warren's memories which contained within his RNA, that included his hatred and knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity. Carrion wielded the power to create a Red Dust that would spread as pestilence as well as his touch that would incapacitate or even cause organic matter to degenerate to the point of disintegration.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> The original Carrion intended to kill Spider-Man with a spider-amoeba, but failed as Carrion was absorbed by the amoeba, engulfed in flames that ensued from his battle.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #31</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://spiderfan.org/characters/carrion1.html|title=SpiderFan.org - Characters : Carrion|website=spiderfan.org}}</ref>

Much later, fellow ESU rival Malcolm McBride stumbled across Warren's old lair, where he was infected with a strain of the Carrion virus and became the second incarnation of Carrion. The virus allowed McBride to become endowed with the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity; however, he was unsure whether he was Dr. Warren's first clone or Malcolm McBride.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #149. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, McBride teamed with the likes of [[Demogoblin]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], but was later cured of his condition and incarcerated in Ravencroft Asylum.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #393. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A man dressed as the Jackal once attacked Alpha Flight and claimed to be Miles Warren's son.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #114. Marvel Comics.</ref> It was later indicated that this Jackal was the Ani-Man Warren created that ultimately murdered the Professor's family.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

A version of the Jackal dubbed as "The Professor" fought Daredevil and Punisher.<ref name="Daredevil Vs. Punisher"/>

Jackal used multiple stand-ins, such as the Miles and Jackal clones in Spider-Island.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #673. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #693. Marvel Comics.</ref> There was also an additional Miles Warren clone accompanying Jackal in Sibling Rivalry after targeting the Superior Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' vol. 1 #2.

''Spider-Man: Life Story'' features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. After the 60s, Miles eventually leaves Empire State and forms his own bio-engineering company. Peter Parker's wife, Gwen Stacy, became his chief biologist. During this time, he was also hired by Norman Osborn to create clones of Norman and Peter, but he also secretly created a clone of Gwen. In 1977, Norman gets word of Warren's additional clone and sends Harry Osborn as the Black Goblin to attack Warren's company, revealing the clones to Harry, Peter, and Gwen in the process. Harry blows up the containment tubes containing the clones, which kills all of them except for Peter's clone. However, Warren reveals that the "Gwen" that Peter was with was actually her clone, while the real Gwen died in the explosion, as he wanted to keep her for himself.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #1-2</ref>

In the two-part episode "The Return of Hydro-Man", he continues his experiments in secret from his underwater lab, with anonymous help from the crime lord [[Silvermane]]. However, Warren's clones are unsuccessful, as their cells could not hold together and would eventually disintegrate. Interested in [[Hydro-Man]]'s ability to dissemble and reassemble, Warren retrieves a DNA sample from the location where the villain evaporated and creates a perfect clone. Like the real Hydro-Man, the clone loves [[Mary Jane Watson]] and demands Warren create a clone of the woman. With Mary Jane having gone missing, Warren retrieves some hair samples from a brush, which he uses to create the clone. When Mary Jane's clone escapes, Hydro-Man goes after to brings back which leads to Spider-Man discovering Warren's underwater lab. While both clones eventually evaporate, Warren is able to retrieve a DNA sample of Spider-Man with the intent of cloning the web-slinger as well.
** In the series finale "I Really, Really Hate Clones", an alternate universe version is shown capturing and cloning Peter Parker. While the real one (believing himself to be the clone) is now [[Ben Reilly]], the clone is Spider-Man only to later learn the truth and transform into the maniacal [[Carnage (comics)|Spider-Carnage]].

He then betrays Smythe and attempts to steal Spider-Man's black symbiote suit for his own schemes. After being defeated, he gives Spider-Man a serum that will enhance his symbiote suit's powers and escapes before the Helicarrier crashes. Later, the Jackal steals the sonic generator meant to eliminate the symbiotes, takes it to [[Central Park]], and modifies it to control the symbiotes.
