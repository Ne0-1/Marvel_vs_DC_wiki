The '''Jackal''' ('''Professor Miles Warren''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. 

An [[Empire State University]] [[biology]] professor, Miles Warren became infatuated with student [[Gwen Stacy]]. After Stacy died, he became a [[mad scientist|demented geneticist]] and genetically enhanced his own body, combining his own [[DNA]] with that of a [[jackal]]. He also cloned Gwen Stacy and Spider-Man, leading to the “[[Clone Saga]]” years later.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Miles Warren was born in [[Queens, New York]].  He was once a student of the [[High Evolutionary]], assisting his master in his experiments to evolve animals into human forms.  Though the Evolutionary failed to create a perfect human likeness in his subjects, Miles succeeded in creating two "New Men" virtually indistinguishable from ordinary humans. Because of this, the relationship between Miles and the Evolutionary became strained, which was made worse when the New Men began worshipping Miles as a God. The Evolutionary banished Miles after he created a mentally unstable creature from a [[Jackal]]. Miles made a new life for himself and started a family. Unfortunately, his research interfered in his personal life and he was subsequently deserted by his wife who took the children with her. Miles wife and children were killed in a car crash caused by his envious mutant jackal creation. Upon learning of this, Miles returned to the Evolutionary's base and took away with him the New Men he created, promising to make them fully human.

Warren spent the rest of the year in Manhattan where he had obtained a position as Professor at Empire State University. There, he would meet [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and Gwen Stacy. Warren secretly fell in love with the much younger Stacy, and after she was killed by the original [[Green Goblin]], Warren swore vengeance on Spider-Man, falsely believing it was him who caused her death. He was approached by one of Norman Osborn's Scriers, offering to assist him in his project to resurrect Gwen Stacy through cloning. When this was discovered by his lab assistant, Warren strangled him and being unable to accept responsibility for the action, created an alter ego called "'''The Jackal'''". Warren then began to further develop his alter ego by fashioning a green suit and training himself athletically. The Jackal harassed Spider-Man numerous times, setting him against various other adversaries such as the [[Punisher]] and the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]].

Meanwhile, his cloning experiments had varying results. Out of three Spider-Man clones he created, only one was a perfect copy of the original. One died prematurely, and the other was horribly disfigured. He also created two clones of himself, one a direct copy, the other a modified clone harboring a powerful virus. His most prized creation however was a perfect copy of Gwen Stacy.

Realizing the end of his plan was near, the Jackal sent his perfect clone out against Spider-Man. With the assistance of the Tarantula, the Jackal clone beat Spider-Man unconscious and transported him to [[Shea Stadium]], along with the Spider-Man clone. The two Spider-Men fought, until the Gwen Stacy clone tore off the Jackal clone's mask and confronted him on his crimes. A subsequent explosion killed the jackal clone and knocked the Spider-Man clone unconscious.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #149</ref>

Meanwhile, the real Miles Warren emerged from hiding in a new, powerful form derived from the genetic material of a true jackal.

===The Clone Saga===
{{main|Clone Saga}}
Almost twenty (real time) years later, it was revealed that the clone of Peter had survived the explosion and went into hiding. In addition, Prof. Warren had made a clone of himself before he died, who went into hibernation for several years. However, in the intervening years another clone of Miles Warren ("Warren Miles") appeared, and actually married the Gwen Stacy clone.  The Jackal's research was also used to create the several incarnations of the villain [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], one of whom was thought to be a failed clone of the Jackal.

He also used his experiments to mutate his own DNA and give himself attributes of an actual Jackal; prior to these events, the Jackal's physical abilities had merely been the result of training rather than any superhuman powers. The Peter Parker clone, unaware that the Jackal lived, took the name [[Ben Reilly]], and went into exile. Years later, he returned to [[New York City]], allied himself with Spider-Man, and became the [[Scarlet Spider]].

The Jackal returned at this point (''Amazing Spider-Man'' #399, March, 1995) and, to help Osborn with his master plan, convinced both Parker and Reilly that Reilly was the real Peter Parker and that the other man was the clone, and created a number of other Peter Parker clones who came into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider, and [[Kaine]].

Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones he could control, was killed falling off a tall building while trying to save the Gwen clone, who was saved by Spider-Man.<ref>''Maximum Clonage Omega'', July, 1995</ref> Shortly after, Parker retired to spend more time with his pregnant wife, [[Mary Jane Watson-Parker]], and Ben Reilly briefly replaced him as Spider-Man, until he died at the hands of the Green Goblin, finally revealing in the process that Parker was and always had been the original Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, Spider-Man'' #75, June, 1996</ref>

The Jackal returned once again. This version of the Jackal is a fourth clone of Miles Warren, even further genetically altered to a point where he frequently displays animalistic tendencies and his body is always cold, causing him to wear a thick fur coat even in the hottest weather. He became a crime-lord calling himself "The Professor" and allied himself with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], but the two of them eventually went to jail.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] Vs. [[Punisher]]''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Jackal had been mutagenically enhanced by combining the genetic material of an actual jackal with his own. As a result he had some degree of superhuman strength. His agility and speed were similarly augmented. Jackal also had razor sharp claws and teeth. Even prior to this, he was capable of holding his own against Spider-Man in a fight, although in these cases he always began with the element of surprise on his side.

The Jackal was a genius in the fields of genetics and biochemistry and a pioneer in the field of cloning. His knowledge of cloning was at least a century ahead of what is known to conventional science. The Jackal was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. When he gained his enhanced abilities he was able to defeat Spider-Man in more than one physical confrontation.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Miles Warren was [[Harry Osborn#Ultimate Harry Osborn|Harry Osborn]]'s [[hypnotherapist]] that helped him repress memories about his father, [[Ultimate Green Goblin|The Green Goblin]].  Later in the [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] story arc of [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], he was revealed to be dating [[Aunt May]]. However, as of now, he had no involvement in the Clone Saga in this continuity and has yet to make any more appearances. His last appearance was a cameo in Ultimate Spider-Man #114, when Aunt May tried to introduce him to Peter, but they had to leave town because of Norman Osborn and he had a patient to handle.

==In other media==
[[Image:AnimatedMilesWarren.png|thumbnail|right|'''Miles Warren''' in the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|1990's animated series]].]]
Miles Warren appears in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', played by [[Jonathan Harris]]. In the series, he didn't turn into the Jackal. Instead, he is a normal scientist, and has no connection to Peter Parker or Gwen Stacy. Warren is the one who creates cloning, but the government banned his experiments. Warren's clones keep dissolving into vapour, because of their DNA. Warren would take interest in the super-villain [[Hydro-Man]], who had the ability to transform himself into water. After finding a sample of his DNA, he creates a clone of Hydro-Man. But the clone becomes violent without [[Mary Jane Watson]], and demands that Warren creates a clone of her. In the end of the final part of ''[[The Return of Hydro-Man]]'', the clones of Hydro-Man and Mary Jane Watson degenerated. However, Warren was able to steal a sample of Spider-Man's DNA, in a possible attempt to clone him. It is also revealed that he works for the crime lord [[Silvermane]].

Spider-Man later visited an alternate universe in which Warren had managed to create a Spider-Man clone, which had escaped and became [[Ben Reilly]].
