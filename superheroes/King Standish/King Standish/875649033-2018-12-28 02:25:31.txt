'''King Standish''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. King Standish first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' (vol. 1) #3 (March 1940). He was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and William Smith.

==Fictional character biography==
King Standish was a young, rich master of disguise who vowed to stop crime. He was considered a criminal by both the police and the underworld, when in fact he was a crime-fighter. Over time his reputation improved somewhat. King Standish always remained in disguise, allowing no one to know what he looked like, including his friends. His actual face and name are never revealed. He wore a [[tuxedo]], an opera cape, a [[top hat]] and a [[domino mask]], whenever making an appearance not in disguise.

His most frequent adversary was the Witch, who rivaled his ability to disguise himself. Although on opposite sides of the law, they developed strong feelings towards each other, despite the fact they never saw each other's face. King attempted many times to convince her to become a crime fighter, but failed.

During World War II, he was contacted by Control and became a member of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS). King Standish remained a member of the OSS until the war was over.

Later, he helped the [[Justice Society of America]] when Jacob Tolzmann became a supernatural threat. With [[Wesley Dodds|Sandman]] and the [[Sylvester Pemberton|Star Spangled Kid]] knocked out, King teamed up with their sidekicks, [[Sanderson Hawkins|Sandy]] and [[Pat Dugan|Stripesy]]. The King disguised himself as Tolzmann's father to distract him, allowing the sidekicks to defeat him.

In ''Justice Society of America'' #29 (vol. 3), a new recruit to the team, [[King Chimera]], reveals a little bit about himself, saying his father was King Standish and that he met with a member of a secret order on a distant island to perfect the art of illusion. King Chimera mentioned his mother had a thing for older men, hinting that he was much older than she.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' #29 (vol. 3) (July 2009)</ref>
