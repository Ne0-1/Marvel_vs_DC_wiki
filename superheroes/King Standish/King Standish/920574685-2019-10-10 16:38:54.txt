==Fictional character biography==
King Standish was a master of disguise who wanted to stop crime. He was considered a criminal by both the police and the underworld, but he was a crime-fighter.  He used [[hand-to-hand combat]] and occasionally guns. Over time his reputation improved. King Standish always remained in disguise, allowing no one to know what he looked like. His actual face and name are never revealed. He wore a [[tuxedo]], an opera cape, a [[top hat]] and a [[domino mask]], whenever making an appearance not in disguise.<ref name="Commic Vine">{{cite web |title=The King |url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-king/4005-61635/ |website=[[Comic Vine]] |accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

His most frequent adversary was the Witch, who rivaled his ability to disguise himself. King attempted to convince her to become a crime fighter, but failed. During World War II, he was contacted by Control to become a member of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), which he remained the war was over.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

Later, he helped the [[Justice Society of America]] when Jacob Tolzmann became a supernatural threat. With [[Wesley Dodds|Sandman]] and the [[Sylvester Pemberton|Star Spangled Kid]] knocked out, King teamed up with their sidekicks, [[Sanderson Hawkins|Sandy]] and [[Pat Dugan|Stripesy]]. The King disguised himself as Tolzmann's father to distract him, allowing the sidekicks to defeat him.<ref name="Commic Vine" /> 

In ''Justice Society of America'' #29 (vol. 3), a new recruit to the team, [[King Chimera]], reveals a little bit about himself, saying his father was King Standish and that he met with a member of a secret order on a distant island to perfect the art of illusion. King Chimera mentioned his mother had a thing for older men, hinting that he was much older than she.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' #29 (vol. 3) (July 2009)</ref>
