'''Coal Tiger''' ('''Prince T'Chaka II''') is a [[fictional character]] who appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[MC2]] series [[A-Next]]. He is the son of T'Challa, King of Wakanda and the superhero known as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].

==Fictional character biography==
When a [[racist]] team of villains called the Soldiers of the Serpent attacked the T'Challa's friend N'kano (who was on a diplomatic mission for [[Wakanda (Marvel Comics)|Wakanda]] in New York), A-Next tried to save him. As the Serpents battled with the heroes of A-Next, T'Challa's son T'Chaka charged into battle. While [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]] tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T'Chaka [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a feral black [[werecat]] called the "Coal Tiger". Coal Tiger's bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-next's favor. He was offered membership with the team after the battle was won, but he declined, stating that he would be available to help if they needed him.

When all of the members of A-Next were captured by an evil version of A-next called [[The Revengers]], Coal Tiger was one of the many heroes who came to free the captured superheroes. When A-Next was freed and the Revengers were defeated, Coal Tiger finally agreed to join the team.

==Powers and abilities==
Coal Tiger can change into a humanoid cat creature. In his feline form, he has superhuman strength and agility, as well as enhanced senses and retractable razor-sharp claws on his fingers and toes.

==Other Coal Tigers==

Coal Tiger is also the name of an alternate universe version of T'Challa himself, who appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' vol 1 #355 as a member of the Gatherers, a group of former Avengers from different universes. 

A Coal Tiger is mentioned in ''[[Captain America]]'' vol 1 #389 as an opponent of the [[Zambia]]n villainess Impala.

In ''Black Panther'' vol 3 #60, the Coal Tigers are mentioned as being a rank in the Panther Cult.

The name "Coal Tiger" was one of several that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were bandying back and forth as a possible name for the character who in mainstream continuity in the [[Marvel Universe]] became Black Panther.
