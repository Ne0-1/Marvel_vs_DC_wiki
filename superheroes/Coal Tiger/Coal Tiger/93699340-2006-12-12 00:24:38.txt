==Fictional character biography==
When a [[racist]] team of villains called the Soldiers of the Serpent attacked the T'Challa's friend N'kano (who was on a diplomatic mission for [[Wakanda]] in New York), A-Next tried to save him. As the Serpents battled with the heroes of A-Next, T'Challa's son T'Chaka charged into battle. While [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]] tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T'Chaka [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a feral black [[werecat]] called the "Coal Tiger". Coal Tiger's bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-next's favor. He was offered membership with the team after the battle was won, but he declined, stating that he would be available to help if the needed him.

When all of the members of A-Next were captured by an evil version of A-next called [[The Revengers]], Coal Tiger was one of the many heroes who came to free the captured superheroes. When A-Next was freed and the Revengers were defeated, Coal Tiger finally agreed to join the team.

Coal Tiger can change into a humanoid cat creature. In his feline form, he has superhuman strength and agility, as well as enhanced senses and retractable razor-sharp claws on his fingers and toes.
