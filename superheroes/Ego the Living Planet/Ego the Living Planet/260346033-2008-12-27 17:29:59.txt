==Fictional character biography==
Like all celestial bodies, Ego condensed from gas and dust in the "Black Galaxy" to become a planet. For some inexplicable reason, however, this particular planet achieved sentience and the ability to move of its own volition. Ego then began absorbing space vessels and even other worlds to survive, planning interstellar conquest. It was this behavior that attracts the attention of the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] Colonizers, who fear that the nearby Ego will consume their home-world. 

The Rigellians discovered Earth, and promised to leave it unmolested if the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] would defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian [[Analyzer (comics)|Recorder]], Thor encounters Ego and after an epic battle defeats it. As a result, Ego vows to never leave the Black Galaxy and renounced its plans of conquest.<ref>''Thor'' #132 - 133 (Sep. - Oct. 1966)</ref> Several months later, a weakened [[Galactus]] invades Ego's space and seeks to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aids Ego in battling Galactus, and generates a massive God Blast that drives Galactus off. In gratitude Ego allows its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers, a race whose planet had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago.<ref>''Thor'' #160 - 161 (Jan. - Feb. 1969)</ref>

A well-meaning Rigellian took a sample of Ego's form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation.<ref>''Thor'' #201</ref> This act drives Ego insane, and it soon gives in to its primordial urges and absorbs the Wanderers, which causes Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and Galactus' herald, [[Firelord]], Thor holds Ego off until Galactus attaches a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which drives the planet constantly through space and thereby prevents it from being a threat to other planets and populated sections of the universe.<ref>''Thor'' #227 - 228 (Sep. - Oct. 1977)</ref>

Years later, Ego eventually gains control of the engine and tracks Galactus to Earth seeking vengeance, but is unable to locate him. Ego began attacking Earth until finally stopped by the [[Fantastic Four]] and an unknown mutant known as L.R "Skip" Collins. It was on this occasion that Ego was destroyed â€” the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] removes the attached propulsion engine and threw it into Ego's "brain", causing an angered Ego to activate it, which unintentionally drives the planet into the Sun. Ego's substance is then broken apart by the Sun's gravitational pull.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #234 - 235 (Sep. - Oct. 1981)</ref>

Ego, however, slowly reforms from a few surviving particles and repairs the propulsion unit. Ego then digested a number of [[Dire Wraith]]s to replenish its' energy reserves, and battles the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]].<ref>''Rom'' #69 (Aug. 1985)</ref>

Ego later joined the [[Elders of the Universe]], as like them it is the only one of its kind in existence. The Elders planned to destroy Galactus, although Ego was sidelined before the confrontation when defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #4 (Oct. 1987)</ref> Ego later captured the Silver Surfer, and attempts to consume his energies.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #22 (Apr. 1989)</ref> After being used as a pawn by the [[Supreme Intelligence]] in a bid to reestablish the [[Kree]] Empire, Ego threatened Earth one final time before being absorbed by the cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #14 - 15 (Sep. - Oct. 1990)</ref>

Ego later attacks a Korbinite fleet and fights the hero [[Beta Ray Bill]]. Ego reveals to Bill that Galactus' propulsion unit is driving Ego mad, and the fleet subsequently destroy the propulsion unit.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #16 (1991)</ref> A sentient bio-verse, initially described as "Super-Ego", then begins to consume Ego, but Ego eventually escapes.<ref>''Thor'' #448 - 450 (June - Aug. 1992)</ref> Driven mad again by the [[Supreme Intelligence]], Ego  battles [[Professor X]] and [[Cadre K]].<ref>''Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet'' (Oct. 2000)</ref> Ego is subsequently captured and sent to Earth as an "infant" in spore form.<ref>''Iron Man'' #34 - 35 (Nov. - Dec. 2000)</ref> Ego begins to consume the Earth as it grows, and is absorbed into Quasar to prevent this.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 2000 - Feb. 2001)</ref> Ego is later one of the beings who oppose Thanos in his bid to become all powerful.<ref>''Marvel Universe: The End'' #5 - 6 (July - Aug. 2003)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as its name suggests, it harbors an extreme superiority complex and can be emotional if thwarted. Ego is propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on it and can travel at faster than light speeds (for unknown reasons, Ego is unable to remove the powerful propulsion unit placed at its south pole). Ego has total control over its entire mass down to the molecular level; it often shapes its surface into the appearance of a gigantic face to address powerful beings, and can also shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. It is able to use its own substance to extrude tentacles, organic sensors, plant-like growth, and to create humanoid vessels for its consciousness. It can shape its surface to appear as a dead inhospitable world, or into an idyllic, lush green paradise to lure unaware space travelers to its surface, which it promptly consumes. Ego possesses various internal features analogous to a living organism, such as gigantic tunnels that have been compared to arteries, and a gigantic brain-like organ deep below its surface. Ego possesses both digestive organs, which it uses when absorbing living beings, and an immune system with which to create powerful antibodies to destroy beings which resist absorption.
