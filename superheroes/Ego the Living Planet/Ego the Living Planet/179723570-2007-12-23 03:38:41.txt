'''Ego the Living Planet''' is a [[fiction]]al [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] being that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Ego was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' vol. 1, #132 (October 1966). 

==Fictional character biography==
Like all celestial bodies, Ego evolved from gas and dust to become a planet. For some inexplicable reason, however, this particular planet achieved sentience and the ability to move of its own volition. Ego then began absorbing space vessels and even other worlds to survive. It was this behavior that drew the attention of the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] Colonizers, who feared that the nearby Ego would consume their home-world. 

The Rigellians discovered Earth, and promised to leave it unmolested if the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] would defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian [[Analyzer (comics)|Recorder]], Thor encountered Ego and after an epic battle defeated it. As a result, Ego vowed to never leave the Black Galaxy. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #132 - 133</ref> Several months later, a weakened [[Galactus]] invaded Ego's space and sought to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aided Ego, and generated a massive God Blast that drove Galactus off. In gratitude Ego allowed its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers, a race whose planet had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #160 - 161</ref>

A well-meaning Rigellian took a sample of Ego's form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation. This act drove Ego insane, and it soon gave in to its primordial urges and absorbed the Wanderers, which caused Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and Galactus' herald, [[Firelord]], Thor held Ego off until Galactus attached a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which drove the planet constantly through space and thereby prevented it from being a threat to other planets. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #227 - 228</ref>

Years later, Ego eventually gained control of the engine and tracked Galactus to Earth, but was unable to locate him. Ego began attacking Earth until finally stopped by the [[Fantastic Four]] and an unknown mutant known as L.R "Skip" Collins. It was on this occasion that Ego was destroyed — the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] removed the attached engine and threw it into Ego's "brain", causing an angered Ego to activate it, which unintentionally drove the planet into the Sun. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #233 - 234</ref>

Ego, however, slowly reformed from a few surviving particles and later joined the [[Elders of the Universe]], as like them it is the only one of its kind in existence. The Elders planned to destroy Galactus, although Ego was sidelined before the confrontation when defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]]. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #4 + 22</ref> 

At one time, Ego was investigated by the [[High Evolutionary]], who then observed as a titanic, cloud-like entity, which he tentatively designated "Super-Ego", absorbed Ego. The Evolutionary theorized that there was more than one Ego (A notion supported by the apparently erratic behavior of the believed-to-be unique living planet over the years, the various origin stories known about it, and by the fact that ''an'' Ego appeared after this one was destroyed by its "parent") and that they might all stem from the "Super-Ego".

After being used as a pawn by the [[Supreme Intelligence]] in a bid to reestablish the [[Kree]] Empire, Ego threatened Earth one final time before being absorbed by the cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. <ref>''Quasar'' #14 - 15</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as the name suggests it suffers from a God complex and can be emotional if thwarted. Ego is propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on it and can travel at faster than light speeds. In terms of appearance, Ego often shapes its surface into the appearance of a gigantic face to address powerful beings, and can also shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. Ego possesses various internal features analogous to a living organism, such as gigantic tunnels that have been compared to arteries, and a gigantic brain-like organ deep below its surface. Ego possesses both digestive organs, which it uses when absorbing living beings, and an immune system with which to create powerful antibodies to destroy beings which resist absorption.
