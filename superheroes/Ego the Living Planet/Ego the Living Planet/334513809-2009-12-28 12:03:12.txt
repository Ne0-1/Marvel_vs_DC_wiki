'''Ego the Living Planet''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #132 (Oct. 1966) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. 

==Development==
Ego was created by Jack Kirby during a phase in which he was fascinated with the universe: Ego; the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]] and [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|The Colonizers]] immediately followed the creation of [[Galactus]] and helped establish Marvel Comics' own "[[space age]] [[mythology]]".<ref>Gartland, Mike.

==Publication history==
=== 1960s ===
Ego the Living Planet was initially introduced in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' issue #132 (September 1966), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].  

Ego also played a prominent role in the ''[[Maximum Security]]'' storyline, appearing in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #35 (Dec. 2000); ''Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet'' (Oct. 2000); ''[[Iron Man]]'' #34 - 35 (Nov. - Dec. 2000); ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #29 (Dec. 2000); ''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'' #23 (Dec. 2000) and ''[[Maximum Security]]'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 2000 - Jan. 2001).

Ego the Living Planet also appeared in the ''[[Oni Press]] Color Special.''<ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=40618|title=Oni Press Color Special}}</ref>

Like all celestial bodies, Ego condensed from gas and dust in the "Black Galaxy" to become a planet. Eons ago, a civilization grew on Ego to a state even more advanced than humans' but neglected to focus their scientific advancement on space travel.  When their sun began the process that would build to a nova, the inhabitants of Ego had no option but to seek shelter in suspended animation within the core of the planet.  This project, dubbed "Project Worldcore" by the civilization's scientists, was spearheaded by a scientist named Egros.  However, Egros' calculations were off by 50 seconds.  Unable to complete the process that would have sealed Project Worldcore and kept his civilization safe, Egros and his planet were both consumed by the nova, but rather than dying they underwent a transformation: using the unprotected bodies of Egros' fellow beings as fuel, Egros' consciousness and the planet merged, becoming the living planet Ego.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #228</ref>

Ego then began absorbing space vessels and even other worlds to survive, planning interstellar conquest. It was this behavior that attracts the attention of the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] Colonizers, who fear that the nearby Ego will consume their home-world. 

The Rigellians discovered Earth, and promised to leave it unmolested if the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] would defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian [[Analyzer (comics)|Recorder]], Thor encounters Ego and after an epic battle defeats it. As a result, Ego vows to never leave the Black Galaxy and renounced its plans of conquest.<ref>''Thor'' #132 - 133 (Sep. - Oct. 1966)</ref> Several months later, a weakened [[Galactus]] invades Ego's space and seeks to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aids Ego in battling Galactus, and generates a massive God Blast that drives Galactus off. In gratitude Ego allows its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers, a race whose planet had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago.<ref>''Thor'' #160 - 161 (Jan. - Feb. 1969)</ref>

A well-meaning Rigellian took a sample of Ego's form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation.<ref>''Thor'' #201</ref> This act drives Ego insane, and it soon gives in to its primordial urges and absorbs the Wanderers, which causes Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and Galactus' herald, [[Firelord]], Thor holds Ego off until Galactus attaches a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which drives the planet constantly through space and thereby prevents it from being a threat to other planets and populated sections of the universe.<ref>''Thor'' #227 - 228 (Sep. - Oct. 1977)</ref>

Years later, Ego eventually gains control of the engine and tracks Galactus to Earth seeking vengeance, but is unable to locate him. Ego began attacking Earth until finally stopped by the [[Fantastic Four]] and an unknown mutant known as L.R "Skip" Collins. It was on this occasion that Ego was destroyed â€” the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] removes the attached propulsion engine and threw it into Ego's "brain", causing an angered Ego to activate it, which unintentionally drives the planet into the Sun. Ego's substance is then broken apart by the Sun's gravitational pull.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #234 - 235 (Sep. - Oct. 1981)</ref>

Ego, however, slowly reforms from a few surviving particles and repairs the propulsion unit. Ego then digested a number of [[Dire Wraith]]s to replenish its' energy reserves, and battles the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]].<ref>''Rom'' #69 (Aug. 1985)</ref>

Ego later joined the [[Elders of the Universe]], as like them it is the only one of its kind in existence. The Elders planned to destroy Galactus, although Ego was sidelined before the confrontation when defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #4 (Oct. 1987)</ref> Ego later captured the Silver Surfer, and attempts to consume his energies.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #22 (Apr. 1989)</ref> After being used as a pawn by the [[Supreme Intelligence]] in a bid to reestablish the [[Kree]] Empire, Ego threatened Earth one final time before being absorbed by the cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #14 - 15 (Sep. - Oct. 1990)</ref>

Ego later attacks a Korbinite fleet and fights the hero [[Beta Ray Bill]]. Ego reveals to Bill that Galactus' propulsion unit is driving Ego mad, and the fleet subsequently destroy the propulsion unit.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #16 (1991)</ref> A sentient bio-verse, initially described as "Super-Ego", then begins to consume Ego, but Ego eventually escapes.<ref>''Thor'' #448 - 450 (June - Aug. 1992)</ref> Driven mad again by the [[Supreme Intelligence]], Ego  battles [[Professor X]] and [[Cadre K]].<ref>''Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet'' (Oct. 2000)</ref> Ego is subsequently captured and sent to Earth as an "infant" in spore form.<ref>''Iron Man'' #34 - 35 (Nov. - Dec. 2000)</ref> Ego begins to consume the Earth as it grows, and is absorbed into Quasar to prevent this.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 2000 - Feb. 2001)</ref>

The threat of Ego appears to have ended, however with Quasar's death during Annihilation, Ego was released in the Universe, only to be approached by the Worldmind to join the new [[Nova Corps]].<ref>''Nova'' #20</ref>
Richard confronts Worldmind about Ego, which reveals that Ego's consciousness has been supplanted, effectively making Ego the new host of Worldmind. Calling itself Nu Xandar, Worldmind tells Richard that he must download the Nova Force into Nu Xandar's power reserves so that it may be spread out throughout the Nova Corps. After some initial hesitation Richard agrees but backs out at the last minute which ended with Worldmind forcefully removing the Nova Force from Richard and returns him to Earth without his powers.<ref>''Nova'' #21</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[War of Kings]], the Nova Corps positioned Nu Xandar at the edge of the Fault, a rip in time-space caused by [[Black Bolt]]'s T-Bomb, to monitor it. Suddenly, Ego was able to resurface his personality on his body, forcing the Corps to reposition their base in the ''Resolute Duty'', a missing Corps vessel.<ref>''Nova'' #29-30</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as its name suggests, it harbors an extreme superiority complex and can be emotional if thwarted. Ego is propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on it and can travel at faster than light speeds (for unknown reasons, Ego is unable to remove the powerful propulsion unit placed at its south pole). Ego has total control over its entire mass down to the molecular level; it often shapes its surface into the appearance of a gigantic face to address powerful beings, and can also shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. It is able to use its own substance to extrude tentacles, organic sensors, plant-like growth, and to create humanoid vessels for its consciousness. It can shape its surface to appear as a dead inhospitable world, or into an idyllic, lush green paradise to lure unaware space travelers to its surface, which it promptly consumes. Ego possesses various internal features analogous to a living organism, such as gigantic tunnels that have been compared to arteries, and a gigantic brain-like organ deep below its surface. Ego possesses both digestive organs, which it uses when absorbing living beings, and an immune system with which to create powerful antibodies to destroy beings which resist absorption.<ref>Flubb, J.A.

==Other versions==
[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Alternate]] versions of Ego have appeared in a number of titles. A version of Ego, [[Oa the Living Planet]], was featured under the [[Amalgam Comics]] imprint, in ''[[Iron Lantern]]'' #1 (June 1997).<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/ironlant.htm#oa Oa the Living Planet] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> Ego has also appeared in alternate versions of the Marvel Universe, in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #53 (December 2004), ''[[Marvel Zombies 2]]'' #1 (December 2007), and ''[[Marvel Adventures]]: The Avengers'' #12 (June 2007), for younger readers.

==Reception and impact==
Roger Lewis argues that Ego the Living Planet reflected [[risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] that people were contemplating in the 1960s, when he was initially conceived.<ref>{{cite book | title = Outlaws of America | author = Roger Lewis | publisher = Penguin | date = 1972}}</ref>

A 2007 issue of [[Marvel Adventures: The Avengers]] featuring Ego entitled "Ego the Loving Planet" met with critical praise for its simultaneous inventiveness and logical sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/117718711510698.htm|title=Marvel Adventures #12 Review|last=Tate|first=Ray|date=2007-04-21|publisher=Comics Bulletin|accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref>
