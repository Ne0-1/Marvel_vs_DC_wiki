'''Ego the Living Planet''' is a [[fictional character]], a supervillain in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #132 (Sept. 1966) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].

==Publication history==
Ego was created by Jack Kirby during a phase in which he was fascinated with the universe. Ego, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]] and [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|The Colonizers]] immediately followed the creation of [[Galactus]] and helped establish Marvel Comics' own "[[space age]] [[mythology]]".<ref>{{cite journal| last=Gartland | first= Mike | title=A Failure to Communicate: Part Two| work= Jack Kirby Collector|number= 22}} Reprinted in {{cite book |title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Volume 5 | first=John, ed.|last=Morrow |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |year=2006 |ISBN=1-893905-57-8 |page=196}}</ref>

Ego the Living Planet was initially introduced in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' issue #132 (Sept. 1966), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. As Kirby recalled in 1969, shortly after the character's debut, Ego's genesis came about when
{{quote|I began to experiment ...and that's how Ego came about. ... A planet that was alive; a planet that was intelligent. That was nothing new either because there had been other stories [about] live planets but that's not acceptable. ... [Y]ou would say, 'Yeah, that's wild,' but how do you relate to it? Why is it alive? So I felt somewhere out in the universe, the universe ... becomes denser and turns liquid — and that in this liquid, there was a giant multiple virus, and if [it] remained isolated for millions and millions of years, it would ... begin to evolve by itself and it would begin to think. By the time we reached it, it might be quite superior to us — and that was Ego.<ref>{{cite news|title='There is Something Stupid in Violence as Violence'| publisher= (Jack Kirby interview), ''[[The Comics Journal|The Nostalgia Journal]]'' | number=30-31| date=November - December 1976 (interview conducted early 1969)}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first = George, ed. | last=Milo |title = The Comics Journal Library, Volume One: Jack Kirby | publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]| year = 2002| isbn = 1-56097-466-4 | page = 7}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==

=== 1960s ===
Ego once told Thor that he was the result of a scientist merging with a planet when that planet's sun went nova.<ref>''Thor'' #228</ref>

Ego began absorbing space vessels and even other worlds to survive, planning interstellar conquest. This behavior attracts the attention of the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] Colonizers, who fear that the nearby Ego will consume their home-world. They recruit the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian [[Analyzer (comics)|Recorder]], Thor encounters Ego, who vows to never leave the Black Galaxy and renounced its plans of conquest, feeling humiliated by his defeat.<ref>''Thor'' #132 - 133 (Sept.-Oct. 1966)</ref> Several months later, a weakened [[Galactus]] invades Ego's space and seeks to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aids Ego in battling Galactus, and drives Galactus off. In gratitude Ego allows its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers, a race whose planet had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago.<ref>''Thor'' #160-161 (Jan.-Feb. 1969)</ref>

=== 1970s ===
The Rigellian [[Tana Nile]] took a sample of Ego's form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation.<ref>''Thor'' #201</ref> This act drives Ego insane, and it soon gives in to its primordial urges and absorbs the Wanderers, which causes Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and Galactus' herald, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]], Thor holds Ego off until Galactus attaches a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which drives the planet constantly through space and thereby prevents it from being a threat to other planets and populated sections of the universe.<ref>''Thor'' #227-228 (Sept.-Oct. 1977)</ref>

=== 1980s ===
Years later, Ego gains control of the engine and tracks Galactus to Earth seeking vengeance, but is unable to locate him. Ego began attacking Earth. He causes massive destruction until finally stopped by the [[Fantastic Four]]. Horrified by the devastation, an unknown reality-altering mutant known as [[The Man with the Power|L.R "Skip" Collins]] undoes the damage caused by Ego as well as all memory of it, excepting the memories of the Fantastic Four as they were off-planet at the time fighting Ego. The superpowered quartet attempted to defeat Ego by removing the power cell from one of the attached propulsion engines, which the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempts to throw into Ego's "brain". In response, an angered Ego activates the engine but, with one engine now deactivated, the other propelled the out-of-control planet into the Sun, the gravitational pull from which broke apart Ego's substance.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #234-235 (Sept.- Oct. 1981)</ref>

Ego, however, slowly reforms from a few surviving particles and repairs the propulsion unit. Ego then digested a number of [[Dire Wraith]]s to replenish its energy reserves, and battles the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]].<ref>''Rom'' #69 (Aug. 1985)</ref>

Ego later joins the [[Elders of the Universe]] in a plan to destroy Galactus. Ego was sidelined before the confrontation when defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #4 (Oct. 1987)</ref> Ego later captured the Silver Surfer, and attempts to consume his energies.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #22 (Apr. 1989)</ref>

=== 1990s ===
Ego later attacks a Korbinite fleet and fights the hero [[Beta Ray Bill]]. Ego reveals to Bill that Galactus' propulsion unit is driving Ego mad, and the fleet subsequently destroy the propulsion unit.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #16 (1991)</ref> A sentient bio-verse, initially described as "Super-Ego", then begins to consume Ego, but Ego eventually escapes.<ref>''Thor'' #448 - 450 (June - Aug. 1992)</ref>

=== 2000s ===
Driven mad by the [[Supreme Intelligence]], Ego lashes out at other planets, destroying them while trying to 'awaken' others like itself, until it is defeated in a battle with [[Professor X]], the Silver Surfer and [[Cadre K]].<ref>''Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet'' (Oct. 2000)</ref> Ego is subsequently captured and sent to Earth as an "infant" in spore form.<ref>''Iron Man'' #34-35 (Nov.-Dec. 2000)</ref> As Ego grows, it begins to consume the Earth, with the Supreme Intelligence intending to allow it to grow so that the Kree can take control of Ego and use it as a weapon against the rest of the universe. [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] absorbs it to prevent this.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1-3 (Dec. 2000 - Feb. 2001)</ref>

When Quasar dies during the Annihilation war,<ref>''Annihilation: Nova'' #4 (2006)</ref> Ego was released back into the Universe, only to be approached by the Worldmind to join the new [[Nova Corps]].<ref>''Nova'' #20</ref>
Ego supplants Worldmind and brainwashes the Corps.  [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] manages to defeat Ego and free Worldmind by lobotomizing the Living Planet.<ref>''Nova'' #23-25</ref> When Ego resurfaces his personality on his body, Nova attacks again and forces the Living Planet to stargate away.<ref>''Nova'' #29-30</ref>

===2010s===
The Stranger reveals his true nature to Ego, that he was one of two sentient bodies created by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] for a science experiment, and that his brother '''Alter-Ego''' has been held in captivity by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] since his birth. Stranger has arranged for Alter-Ego to hate Ego, intending to learn through their battle if freedom or captivity breeds a stronger will. Alter-Ego is wounded and loses mass, but Thor intervenes before Ego can strike a killing blow. Alter-Ego becomes a moon of Ego, and the two begin to travel together as a family.<ref>''Astonishing Thor'' #1-5 (Nov. 2010 - July 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as its name suggests, it harbors an extreme superiority complex and can be emotional if thwarted. Ego is propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on it and can travel at faster than light speeds (for unknown reasons, Ego is unable to remove the powerful propulsion unit placed at its south pole). Ego has total control over its entire mass down to the molecular level; it often shapes its surface into the appearance of a gigantic face to address powerful beings, and can also shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. It is able to use its own substance to extrude tentacles, organic sensors, plant-like growth, and to create humanoid vessels for its consciousness. It can shape its surface to appear as a dead inhospitable world, or into an idyllic, lush green paradise to lure unaware space travelers to its surface, which it promptly consumes. Ego possesses various internal features analogous to a living organism, such as gigantic tunnels that have been compared to arteries, and a gigantic brain-like organ deep below its surface. It can heat up its internal temperature to destroy beings inside it. Ego possesses both digestive organs, which it uses when absorbing living beings, and an immune system with which to create powerful antibodies to destroy beings which resist absorption.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flubb|first= J.A. |title=The Great Kirby Science Fiction Concepts|work=Jack Kirby Collector|number=15|pages= 4–9}} Reprinted in {{cite book |title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Volume 3 | first=John, ed.|last=Morrow |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=1999 | ISBN= 1-893905-02-0 |pages=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eHM3vW6ogDsC&pg=PA132 132–133]}}</ref>

It also possesses vast psionic abilities, and can project blasts powerful enough to destroy other worlds.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1</ref> He was able to read Thor's mind during his first appearance and scan their biological structure.<ref>''Thor'' #133</ref>

==Other versions==
[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Alternate]] versions of Ego have appeared in a number of titles. [[Oa the Living Planet]], an amalgamation version of Ego and DC's Planet Oa, was featured under the [[Amalgam Comics]] imprint, in ''[[Iron Lantern (comic book)|Iron Lantern]]'' #1, where he is the source of the power for the Green Lantern Corps.<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/ironlant.htm#oa|Oa the Living Planet}}</ref> Another version of Ego in the Amalgam universe appeared in ''[[Thorion of the New Asgods]]'' as Ego-Mass, an amalgamation of Ego and the Source Wall.<ref>[http://www.immortalthor.net/bio_alternate_thorion.html] at Immortalthor.net</ref> Ego has also appeared in alternate versions of the Marvel Universe, in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #53 (December 2004) and ''[[Marvel Adventures]]: The Avengers'' #12 (June 2007), for younger readers. In ''[[Marvel Zombies 2]]'' he is one of the last few survivors of a reality-spanning zombie rampage. However, he is found and eaten.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 2]]'' #1 (December 2007)</ref>

Ego the Living Planet reveals that he has absorbed planets to grow in size. Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. then start to pummel Ego the Living Planet.

==Reception and impact==
