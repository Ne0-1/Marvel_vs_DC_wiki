'''Ego the Living Planet''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #132 (September 1966) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].  Ego is portrayed by [[Kurt Russell]] in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.

==Publication history==
Ego the Living Planet was initially introduced in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' issue #132 (Sept. 1966), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].

Ego was created by Kirby during a phase in which he was fascinated with the universe. Ego, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]], and [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|The Colonizers]] immediately followed the creation of [[Galactus]], thus establishing Marvel Comics' own "[[space age]] [[mythology]]".<ref>{{cite journal| last=Gartland | first= Mike | title=A Failure to Communicate: Part Two| work= Jack Kirby Collector|number= 22}} Reprinted in {{cite book |title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Volume 5 | first=John, ed.|last=Morrow |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |year=2006 |ISBN=1-893905-57-8 |page=196}}</ref> As Kirby recalled in 1969, shortly after the character's debut, Ego's genesis came when:
{{quote|I began to experiment ...and that's how Ego came about. ... A planet that was alive; a planet that was intelligent. That was nothing new either because there had been other stories [about] live planets but that's not acceptable. ... [Y]ou would say, 'Yeah, that's wild,' but how do you relate to it? Why is it alive? So I felt somewhere out in the universe, the universe ... becomes denser and turns liquid — and that in this liquid, there was a giant multiple virus, and if [it] remained isolated for millions and millions of years, it would ... begin to evolve by itself and it would begin to think. By the time we reached it, it might be quite superior to us — and that was Ego.<ref>{{cite news|title='There is Something Stupid in Violence as Violence'| publisher= (Jack Kirby interview), ''[[The Comics Journal|The Nostalgia Journal]]'' (interview conducted early 1969) | number=30–31| date=November 1976}} Reprinted in {{cite book|first = George, ed. | last=Milo |title = The Comics Journal Library, Volume One: Jack Kirby | publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]| year = 2002| isbn = 1-56097-466-4 | page = 7}}</ref>}}

Ego returned as a protagonist in ''Thor'' #160–161 (Jan.–Feb. 1969), and made a guest appearance in #201. His origin is explored in ''Thor'' #228.

Following appearances in ''Fantastic Four'' #234–235 (Sept.–Oct. 1981) and ''[[Rom the Spaceknight|Rom]]'' #69 (Aug. 1985), Ego had a recurring role in ''Silver Surfer'' vol, 3 #4–22 (1987–1989). The character returned in the 1991 ''Thor'' annual and issues #448–450 (June–Aug 1992).

Ego played a prominent role in the company-wide crossover storyline "[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]",  appearing in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #35 (Dec. 2000); ''Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet'' (Oct. 2000); ''[[Iron Man]]'' #34–35 (Nov.–Dec. 2000); ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #29 (Dec. 2000); ''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'' #23 (Dec. 2000) and ''[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]'' #1–3 (Dec. 2000{{snd}}Jan. 2001).

The character returned in ''Nova'' vol 4 #20–30 and ''Astonishing Thor'' #1–5 (Nov 2010{{snd}}July 2011).

Ego the Living Planet also appeared in the ''[[Oni Press]] Color Special.''

==Fictional character biography==

=== 1960s ===
Ego once told Thor that he was the result of a scientist merging with a planet when that planet's sun went nova.<ref>''Thor'' #228. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ego began absorbing space vessels and even other worlds to survive, planning interstellar conquest. This behavior attracts the attention of the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] Colonizers, who fear that the nearby Ego will consume their home world. They recruit the Thunder God, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], to defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian [[Analyzer (comics)|Recorder]], Thor encounters Ego, who vows never to leave the Black Galaxy and renounced its plans of conquest, feeling humiliated by his defeat.<ref>''Thor'' #132–133 (Sept.–Oct. 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref> Several months later, a weakened [[Galactus]] invades Ego's space and seeks to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aids Ego in battling Galactus and drives Galactus off. In gratitude, Ego allows its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers, a group of various alien races whose planets had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago.<ref>''Thor'' #160–161 (Jan.–Feb. 1969). Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== 1970s ===
The Rigellian [[Tana Nile]] took a sample of Ego's form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation.<ref>''Thor'' #201. Marvel Comics.</ref> This act drives Ego insane, and it soon gives in to its primordial urges and absorbs the Wanderers, which causes Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and Galactus's herald, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]], Thor holds Ego off until Galactus attaches a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which drives the planet constantly through space and thereby prevents it from being a threat to other planets and populated sections of the universe.<ref>''Thor'' #227–228 (Sept.–Oct. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== 1980s ===
Years later, Ego gains control of the engine and tracks Galactus to Earth, seeking vengeance.  Unable to locate him, Ego attacks Earth. He causes massive destruction until finally stopped by the [[Fantastic Four]]. Horrified by the devastation, an unknown, reality-altering mutant known as [[The Man with the Power|L.R "Skip" Collins]] undoes the damage caused by Ego as well as all memory of it, excluding the memories of the Fantastic Four as they were off planet at the time, fighting Ego. The superpowered quartet attempted to defeat Ego by removing the power cell from one of the attached, propulsion engines, which the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempts to throw into Ego's "brain". In response, an angered Ego attempts to counter with his remaining engines but, with one engine now deactivated, the other propels the now-out-of-control planet into the Sun, its gravitational pull breaking apart Ego's substance.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #234–235 (Sept.–Oct. 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ego, however, slowly reforms from a few surviving particles and repairs the propulsion unit. Ego then digests a number of [[Dire Wraith]]s to replenish its energy reserves, and battles the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]].<ref>''Rom'' #69 (Aug. 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ego later joins the [[Elders of the Universe]] in a plan to destroy Galactus. Ego is sidelined before the confrontation when he is defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #4 (Oct. 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> Ego subsequently captures the Silver Surfer and attempts to consume his energies.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #22 (Apr. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== 1990s ===
Ego attacks a Korbinite fleet and fights the hero, [[Beta Ray Bill]]. Ego reveals to Bill that Galactus's propulsion unit is driving Ego mad, and the fleet subsequently destroys the propulsion unit.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #16 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> A sentient bio-verse, initially described as "Super-Ego", then begins to consume Ego, but Ego eventually escapes.<ref>''Thor'' #448–450 (June–Aug. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

=== 2000s ===
Driven mad by the [[Supreme Intelligence]], Ego lashes out at other planets, destroying them while trying to 'awaken' others like itself, until it is defeated in a battle with [[Professor X]], the Silver Surfer and [[Cadre K]].<ref>''Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet'' (Oct. 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> Ego is subsequently captured and sent to Earth as an "infant" in spore form.<ref>''Iron Man'' #34–35 (Nov.–Dec. 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> As Ego grows, it begins to consume the Earth, with the Supreme Intelligence intending to allow it to grow so that the [[Kree]] can take control of Ego and use it as a weapon against the rest of the universe. [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] absorbs it to prevent this.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1–3 (Dec. 2000{{snd}}Feb. 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Quasar dies during the Annihilation war,<ref>''Annihilation: Nova'' #4 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> Ego was released back into the Universe, only to be approached by the Worldmind to join the new [[Nova Corps]].<ref>''Nova'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ego supplants Worldmind and brainwashes the Corps.  [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] manages to defeat Ego and free Worldmind by lobotomizing the Living Planet.<ref>''Nova'' #23–25. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Ego resurfaces his personality on his body, Nova stargates [[Mindless Ones]] into Ego's brain, causing pain to the Living Planet and forcing him to stargate away.<ref>''Nova'' #29–30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2010s===
Ego learns he was one of two sentient bodies created by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] for a science experiment, and that his brother '''Alter-Ego''' has been held in captivity by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] since birth. While Ego seeks a similar entity to itself, the Stranger has arranged for Alter-Ego to hate Ego, intending to learn through their battle if freedom or captivity breeds a stronger will. Alter-Ego is wounded and loses mass when Ego is forced to attack it in self-defense, but Thor intervenes before Ego can strike a killing blow. The remaining fragments of Alter-Ego becomes a moon of Ego, and the two begin to travel together as a family.<ref>''Astonishing Thor'' #1–5 (Nov. 2010{{snd}}July 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Ego is infested by large insect-like creatures he hires [[Rocket Raccoon]] to eradicate them.<ref>[[Young, Skottie]] (w) [[Parker, Jake]] (a). ''[[Rocket Raccoon]]'' (Vol. 2) #6, Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Galactus]], changed into the Life-Bringer by the Ultimates, encounters Ego after regaining his strength after a battle with the new universal construct Lagos. Ego attacks Galactus as he journeys to his inner brain at the center of the planet, however loses control of his constructs, which realize that Galactus is not a threat. Ego then reveals that before his creation by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], his consciousness was that of a man named Egros, similar to Galactus' former self Galan. After formally meeting one another and putting aside their past animosities, Galactus uses his Life-Bringer abilities to form a body for the rest of Ego, who now calls himself Ego-Prime. Ego-Prime then joins Eternity Watch, a group Galactus has put together to deal with the First Firmament, the first iteration of all that is, who had chained [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as its name suggests, it harbors an extreme superiority complex and can be emotional if thwarted. For a while Ego was propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on it and could travel at faster than light speeds (for unknown reasons, Ego was unable to remove the powerful propulsion unit placed at its south pole), however, later, this device was removed.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #234–235 (Sept – Oct 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> Ego has total control over its entire mass down to the molecular level; it often shapes its surface into the appearance of a gigantic face to address powerful beings, and can also shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. It is able to use its own substance to extrude tentacles, organic sensors, plant-like growth, and to create humanoid vessels for its consciousness. It can shape its surface to appear as a dead, inhospitable world, or into an idyllic, lush-green paradise to lure unwary space travelers to its surface, whom it promptly consumes. Ego possesses various internal features analogous to a living organism, such as gigantic tunnels that have been compared to arteries, and a gigantic brain-like organ deep below its surface. It can heat up its internal temperature to destroy beings inside it. Ego possesses both digestive organs, which it uses when absorbing living beings, and an immune system with which to create powerful antibodies to destroy beings which resist absorption.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flubb|first= J.A. |title=The Great Kirby Science Fiction Concepts|work=Jack Kirby Collector|number=15|pages= 4–9}} Reprinted in {{cite book |title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Volume 3 | first=John, ed.|last=Morrow |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=1999 | ISBN= 1-893905-02-0 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eHM3vW6ogDsC&pg=PA132 132–133]}}</ref>

It also possesses vast psionic abilities, and can project blasts powerful enough to destroy other worlds.<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was able to read Thor's mind during his first appearance and scan his biological structure.<ref>''Thor'' #133. Marvel Comics.</ref>

However, being bored of immortality and disappointed with a universe full of inferior life, Ego decides to remake all worlds in the universe into extensions of himself, a plan that would require planted seedlings and the power of another Celestial to activate them. To achieve this, Ego mates with various species until a suitable offspring would be conceived to help put his plan into action. The only suitable offspring turns out to be Peter Quill, although he rebels and eventually helps destroy Ego when Quill learns that Ego killed Quill's mother in order to eliminate the distraction she might have posed to his plan.
