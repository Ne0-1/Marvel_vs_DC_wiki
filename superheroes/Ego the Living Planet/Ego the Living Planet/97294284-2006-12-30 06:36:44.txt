'''Ego the Living Planet''' is a [[fictional character]] that exists in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], it first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', vol. 1, #132 (October 1966). 

==Fictional character biography==

Like all celestial bodies, Ego evolved from gas and dust to become a planet. For some inexplicable reason, however, this particular planet achieved sentience and the ability to move of its own volition. Like all living organisms, Ego needs to consume matter to survive, and began absorbing space vessels and even other worlds. It was this behaviour that drew the attention of the Rigellian Colonizers, who feared that the nearby Ego would consume their homeworld. 

The Rigellians discovered Earth, and promised to leave it unmolested if the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] would defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian Recorder, Thor encountered Ego and after an epic battle defeated it. As a result, Ego vowed to never leave the Black Galaxy. Several months later, a weakened [[Galactus]] invaded Ego's space and sought to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aided Ego, and by peforming the "god-blast" Thor actually succeded in driving Galactus away. In gratitude Ego allowed its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers, a race whose planet had been the very first devoured by Galactus billions of years ago. 

A well-meaning Rigellian took a sample of Ego's form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation. This act drove Ego insane, and it soon gave in to its primordial urges and absorbed the Wanderers, which caused Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally [[Hercules (comics)|Hercules]] and Galactus' herald, [[Firelord]], Thor held Ego off until Galactus attached a massive starship engine to Ego's south pole, which would drive the planet constantly through space and thereby prevent it from being a threat to other planets. 

Years later, Ego eventually gained control of the engine and tracked Galactus to Earth, but was unable to locate him. Ego began attacking Earth until finally stopped by the [[Fantastic Four]] and an unknown mutant known as L.R "Skip" Collins. It was on this occasion that Ego was destroyed - the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] removed the attached engine and hurlt it into Ego's "brain", causing an angered Ego to activate it, which unintentionally drove the planet into the Sun.

Ego, however, slowly reformed from a few surviving particles and later joined the [[Elders of the Universe]], as like them it was the only one of its kind in existence. The Elders planned to destroy Galactus, although Ego was sidelined before the confrontation when defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]]. After being used as a pawn by the [[Supreme Intelligence]] in a bid to reestablish the [[Kree]] Empire, Ego threatened Earth one final time before being absorbed by the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] into the Quantum Zone.

==Powers and abilities==

Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as the name suggests it suffers from a God complex and can be emotional if thwarted. Ego is propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on it and can travel at faster than light speeds. In terms of appearance, Ego often shapes its surface into the appearance of a gigantic face to address powerful beings, and can also shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. Ego possesses various internal features analogous to a living organism - such as gigantic tunnels which have been compared to arteries, and a gigantic brain-like organ deep below its surface. Ego possess both digestive organs which it uses when absorbing living beings, and an immune system with which to create powerful antibodies to destroy beings which resist absorption.

==Alternate versions==

In one of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|realities]] visited by the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], Ego plants a piece of itself on Earth, which in turn becomes a "living planet". Ego hopes to gain an ally against the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] Gammenon the Gatherer and Jemiah the Analyser, who seek to destroy Ego for pushing the homeworld of a race known as Trinarians into a blackhole - thus ruining millennia of Celestial experimentation. Ego tries to convince Earth to consume every living creature on it in order to gain power to fight the Celestials, but [[Reed Richards]] persuades Earth to protect "its children". Earth then battles Ego, and the latter is killed by one of [[Doctor Doom]]'s devices, which [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] teleports into Ego's brain.

==In other media==

Ego appeared in both the ''Fantastic Four'' <!--Which one?--> and ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' animated series.
