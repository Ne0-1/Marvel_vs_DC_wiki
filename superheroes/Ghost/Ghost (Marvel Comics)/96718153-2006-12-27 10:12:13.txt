==Character history==

Virtually nothing is known as yet about the true identity of the Ghost. He claims to have been a business executive at one time. The Ghost seeks to destroy various corporations through sabotage, and is apparently most interested in attacking those dealing in electronics and high technology. He is willing to do this without financial recompensation, but often hires himself out to corporations that wish to destroy rival companies. The Ghost is a brilliant [[inventor]], [[technician]], [[engineer]], [[demolition|demolitions expert]], and [[computer scientist]].

===The Accutech Merger===

He was initially hired by '''Carrington Pax''', a leading exeuctive of the [[Roxxon]] Oil Corporation, to destroy Accutech Research and Development. Accutech was trying to develop a beta particle generator and when they refused to sell it to Roxxon, the Ghost was hired to drive Accutech into bankruptcy. '''Tony Stark''' was interested in acquiring Accutech's technology and bought the company. Investigating a disturbance at the new facility as '''[[Iron Man]]''', he first met the Ghost.

The Ghost wears a [[battlesuit]] that is powered by [[electricity]] and is controlled by mental commands through [[cybernetic]] circuits. His battlesuit allows him  to become invisibile and the ability to phase through objects, but not at the same time. He is also undetectable by most scanning devices.

The Ghost uses an array of weaponry including handguns that fire electrical charges and handguns that fire concussive blasts. He also uses explosive devices including bombs activated by sound.
