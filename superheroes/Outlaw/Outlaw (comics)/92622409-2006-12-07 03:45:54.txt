'''Outlaw''' (or '''Inez Temple''') is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Marvel Comics]] for their series' ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' and ''[[Agent X]]''. She is a [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] with the abilities of superhuman strength, durability, agility, and an uncanny accuracy with [[firearm]]s. 

==Character history==
Inez Temple was born in [[Texas]] and as a child she was bullied by other children, who called her ''Crazy Inez''. This nickname still enrages Inez. Due to her [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] strength, she was far stronger than her peers and beat them whenever they bullied her, but her father taught her to be responsible with her powers.

When she grew up, she became a [[mercenary]]. She encountered [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] several times and flirted with him, but the two never really got a chance to hit it off. Outlaw was called in as a shooting instructor for [[Agent X|Alex Hayden]] aka Agent X. They were both hired shortly afterwards to steal the [[Punisher]]'s guns and despite being competitors, they started a romantic relationship. They failed to obtain the guns, but Outlaw started to work with Agent X. When Alex announced his plans to set up a special agency for mercenaries, known as Agency X, she had to disappoint him though; her father had taken ill and she went back to Texas to be with him.

She returned after her father died and discovered that in her absence Alex had had an affair with his secretary [[Sandi Brandenberg]]. Her rage  vanished when she saw that Alex was being attacked by the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Black Swan called Outlaw "Crazy Inez" and in a fit of rage, Outlaw punched straight through his torso. This wasn't enough to kill Black Swan though and together with [[Taskmaster]] and Sandi, they defeated the Black Swan. Outlaw and Alex continued their relationship (as did Sandi and Taskmaster). She aided Alex Hayden with his mercenary company, Agency X, but with the end of the ''Agent X'' series, she disappeared from the [[limelight]].

After [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], she was one of the few mutants to retain her powers. Heeding [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops's]] call for [[sanctuary]], Outlaw went to the [[X-Mansion]] for protection and ran into [[Peepers]] along the way who was on the run from the Sapien League. She is one of the 198, and is currently bunking with [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. She has struck a rather friendly relationship with Magma. She listens when Magma complaines about [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] always following her and never leaving her alone even in her dreams.

==Powers and abilities==
Outlaw has some degree of superhuman strength, the exact limits of which aren't known. However, she can punch through brick walls with ease. The tissues of her body are somewhat more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, she is far from invulnerable and can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials or with sufficient force, much like an ordinary human. If injured, Outlaw is capable of healing herself somewhat faster than an ordinary human.
Apart from her mutant powers, Outlaw has exceptional skill with firearms and with a lasso.

==Notes==
* According to writer [[Gail Simone]], who created the character, Inez was descended from Lance Temple, the [[Old West]] gunfighter known as the [[Outlaw Kid]]; this was alluded to in an issue of ''Agent X'' when she was seen reading a book about the Outlaw Kid. 
* Outlaw's long blond hair is a wig, and she possesses [[breast implants]],  much to Agent X's disappointment.
