'''Outlaw''' ('''Inez Temple''') is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Marvel Comics]] for their series' ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' and ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]''. She is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with the abilities of superhuman strength, durability, and an uncanny aptitude with [[firearm]]s. 

==Fictional character biography==
Inez Temple was born in [[Texas]] and as a child she was bullied by other children, who called her ''Crazy Inez''. This nickname still enrages Inez. Due to her [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] strength, she was far stronger than her peers and beat them whenever they bullied her, but her father taught her to be responsible with her powers.

===Growing up===
When she grew up, she became a [[mercenary]], covering her hair with a long, blonde wig and even had breast argumentation surgery.<ref>[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)]] #2, October 2002</ref> She encountered [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] several times and flirted with him, but the two never really got a chance to hit it off. Outlaw was called in as a shooting instructor for [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Alex Hayden]] aka Agent X. They were both hired shortly afterwards to steal the [[Punisher]]'s Colt .45 handguns and despite being competitors, they started a romantic relationship. They failed to steal the Punisher's guns and were locked up in a phone booth minus their weapons and clothes by Castle. The Punisher then killed the people who had sent them. After that Outlaw started to work with Agent X. When Alex announced his plans to set up a special agency for mercenaries, known as Agency X, she had to disappoint him though; her father had taken ill and she went back to Texas to be with him.

She returned after her father died and discovered that in her absence Alex had had an affair with his secretary [[Sandi Brandenberg]]. Her rage  vanished when she saw that Alex was being attacked by the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Black Swan called Outlaw "Crazy Inez" and in a fit of rage, Outlaw punched straight through his torso. This wasn't enough to kill Black Swan though and together with [[Taskmaster]] and Sandi, they defeated the Black Swan. Outlaw and Alex continued their relationship (as did Sandi and Taskmaster). She aided Alex Hayden with his mercenary company, Agency X, but with the end of the ''Agent X'' series, she disappeared from the [[limelight]].

===M-Day and The 198===
After [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], she was one of the few mutants to retain her powers. Heeding [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops']] call for [[sanctuary]], Outlaw went to the [[X-Mansion]] for protection and ran into [[Peepers]] along the way who was on the run from the Sapien League and battling their leader, the [[Leper Queen]]. She becomes one of the 198, and was bunking with [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]]. She struck a rather friendly relationship with Magma; listening when Magma complains about [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] always following her and never leaving her alone even in her dreams. 

===Civil War===
When a group of superheroes known as the New Warriors accidentally blow up a town causing the general public to turn on superheroes and eventually ignite a superhero civil war. Domino, Shatterstar and Caliban break out the 198 and take them to a bunker in the middle of the desert. Unfortunately they get sealed inside with nuclear weapons and are activated for self-detonation. Outside the X-Men get involved with a fight against Bishop and the O*N*E and Domino wants to help them. Lorelei Travis notices that Cyclops is being controlled by Johnny Dee and recounts the story of the first few days at the 198 encampment. Outlaw is then used by Johnny Dee along with other mutants to attack Domino and Shatterstar. After holding Domino at gunpoint, Toad snaps her out of it. They are all freed from the bunker by combined X-Men, Avengers and military forces. Outlaw takes a leadership role throughout the crisis. <ref>"X-Men: Civil War" #1-4 (2006)</ref>

===Back with Agency X===
Outlaw was later kidnapped, bound and gagged along with [[Sandi Brandenberg]] by T-Ray, one of Deadpool's nemeses.  Deadpool swiftly rescued them, seemingly killing T-Ray by skewering his head with his sword.  The two were reunited with a now-obese Agent X, after being experimented on by [[HYDRA]], and ended up under Deadpool's employ after being tentatively appointed head of Agency X by Hayden.  Outlaw and Sandi then joined [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]] to help bring Deadpool and Bob: Agent of HYDRA back to the present day, after Weasel accidentally transported the two to World War II.  After they were restored, the two stayed with the [[Fantastic Four]], allegedly to play cards.

===Deadpool: Suicide Kings===
After being critically wounded from a fight with the Punisher, Deadpool comes to Outlaw for assistance. She reveals that she and Agent X are no longer in a relationship.<ref>''Deadpool: Suicide Kings'' #2</ref> Deadpool later returns and remodels her house after it is destroyed during a fight with the Punisher. She then sleeps with Deadpool after seeing that he actually cares for her.<ref>''Deadpool: Suicide Kings'' # 5</ref>

===Second Coming===
Recently Outlaw has been seen on the mutant island of Utopia. During Second Coming, after the dome is set and the Nimrods arrive, Cyclops gathers mutants, including Inez , and delivers a speech saying that it's everyone's time to fight, today they are all combatants, today they are all X-Men.<ref> ''New Mutants #14 </ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Outlaw has some degree of superhuman strength, the exact limits of which aren't known. However, she can punch through brick walls with ease. The tissues of her body are somewhat more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, she is far from invulnerable and can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials or with sufficient force, much like an ordinary human. If injured, Outlaw is capable of healing herself somewhat faster than an ordinary human.
Apart from her mutant powers, Outlaw has exceptional skill with firearms and with a lasso.
