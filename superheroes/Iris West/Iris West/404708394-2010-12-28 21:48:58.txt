==Fictional character biography==
In her first appearance, Iris was a reporter for the ''Picture News'', based in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], and the girlfriend of the Barry Allen, who is secretly the Flash.  Eventually, she learned that Barry was not only the city's heroic speedster, but her step-nephew, Wally West, was [[Kid Flash]]. In ''Flash'' #165 (November 1966), she married Barry, discovering on their wedding night that Barry was the Flash (through Barry talking in his sleep).  During this time, the couple discovered that Iris was born in the 30th Century (c 2945 AD), and had been sent back to the present shortly before "Earth-East" attacked "Earth-West," when Central City was a self-contained city. After years as a prominent presence in the Flash's life and Central City, she was killed by [[Professor Zoom]] during a costume party. Zoom vibrated his hand into her head, solidifying it just enough to kill her.<ref>''Flash'' #275  (July 1979), ''Flash'' #283 (March 1980).</ref><ref name="dc-flas">{{Citation|last = Jimenez|first = Phil|author-link = Phil Jimenez|contribution = The Flash|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 124â€“127|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Enraged by his wife's death, Barry, as the Flash, killed Zoom by breaking his neck. 

Iris did not stay dead for long. As Iris's biological parents, the Russells (with the help of a future Flash, John Fox), sent the then-infant Iris to the past, where she was adopted by Ira West, her "death" caused a paradox that was resolved after the Russells placed her consciousness into a new body. Barry was reunited with Iris in her time,<ref>''Flash'' #350  (October 1985)</ref> and were able to spend a month together. However, the couple knew if Barry returned to the past, he would die in the catalytic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref>As depicted in ''Crisis in Infinite Earths'' #8 (November 1985)</ref> During their time together, they conceived the [[Tornado Twins]], Don and Dawn. Don married the descendant of Professor Zoom, [[Meloni Thawne]], hoping to end the feud between the two families. They had a son, Bart, whose powers manifested at an early age and caused him to age at an accelerated rate. Don and Dawn died saving 30th Century [[Earth]] from an invasion by the [[Dominators]]. Iris took Bart to the past to enlist the aid of her nephew (by then, Wally had taken the mantle of the Flash) in saving her grandson. After Bart's accelerated aging slowed down, he went by the name of Impulse. Not much is known about her after that, but Iris volunteered to take care of the [[Weather Wizard]]'s orphaned son. Wally West later named [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|his daughter]] Iris in honor of his aunt.

A mysterious hooded figure enlisted the help of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]<ref> ''The Flash'' (v.3) #10</ref> to attack Bart while he confronted [[Captain Cold]], and later revealed herself as Iris. Her plan is to somehow put her grandson, who, by then, had taken up the Flash mantle, out of commission for a week to protect him from a future she was determined to change. Unfortunately, a weakened Bart was killed by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], thanks to an elaborate plan by his clone "brother" [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]].<ref> (''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #13'')</ref>

In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, Iris is seen tearfully looking over photographs of her late husband, when a disembodied voice calls her name. Barry returns to life in ''DC Universe'' #0 and ''Final Crisis'' #2. Iris spends some time as part of a Darkseid-resistance cell operating out of the [[Hall of Justices]]. Other members include [[Linda Park]] and her two children. In ''Final Crisis'' #4, Iris is shown to have been corrupted by the [[Anti-Life Equation]], Barry is able to break its hold over her by kissing her and enveloping her in the [[Speed Force]]. Iris starts crying at the sight of Barry, who reassures her everything will be okay.

After [[The Flash: Rebirth|the return of her husband]], Iris is shown fully returning to her life alongside the rest of the Flash family. Still overjoyed by the return of Barry, she doesn't get much time to spend with him, as Barry is still mentally scarred from his deathly ordeal and staunchly refuses to stop and enjoy even a moment of "normal" life.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> She's also shown to be much younger than she previously had appears, later an implied from the resurrected Professor Zoom that Iris's currently youthful appearance was because of the Speed Force due to the contacts with her husband at proximity since ''Final Crisis''. She resumes her career as a crime reporter at Central City.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
*Iris Allen made a guest appearance in the two-hour pilot episode of ''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]'' played by actress [[Paula Marshall]]. Here, she is portrayed as Barry's girlfriend, just as she is in the comics, but they break up, and so they do not get married. Unlike the comics books, she's not a reporter instead a graphic artist.

===Film===
*Iris Allen appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' voiced by [[Vicki Lewis]]. Here she is also portrayed as the wife of Barry Allen.

===Novel===
*Iris Allen is featured in the Justice League novel ''Flash: Stop Motion'' by Mark Shultz. The novel explains that Iris and her deceased husband Barry Allen raised Wally West after his parents died. As an adult, Wally now has to defend her from a creature called the Superluminoid that can travel faster than the speed of light. Wally discovers that both he and his aunt Iris possess the 'metagene' that gave the former his powers when the gene was triggered by the lightning bolt in the lab that gave him his superspeed. The novel indicates that Iris's metagene has never manifested itself with any remarkable powers, although the potential is there under the right circumstances.
