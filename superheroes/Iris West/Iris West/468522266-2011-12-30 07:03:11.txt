==Fictional character biography==
In her first appearance, Iris is a reporter for the ''Picture News'', based in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], and the girlfriend of Barry Allen, who is secretly the Flash. Unaware of his secret, Iris often chides Barry for his frequently being late. Eventually, she learns that Barry is not only the city's heroic speedster, but her step-nephew, Wally West, is [[Kid Flash]]. In ''Flash'' #165 (November 1966), she marries Barry, discovering on their wedding night that Barry is the Flash (through Barry talking in his sleep).  During this time, the couple discovers that Iris was born in the 30th Century (c 2945 AD), and had been sent back to the present shortly before "Earth-East" attacked "Earth-West," when Central City was a self-contained city. After years as a prominent presence in the Flash's life and Central City, she is killed by [[Professor Zoom]] during a costume party. Zoom vibrated his hand into her head, solidifying it just enough to kill her.<ref>''Flash'' #275  (July 1979), ''Flash'' #283 (March 1980).</ref><ref name="dc-flas">{{Citation|last = Jimenez|first = Phil|author-link = Phil Jimenez|contribution = The Flash|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 124–127|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Enraged over his wife's murder, Barry killed Zoom by breaking his neck. 

Iris did not stay dead for long. As Iris's biological parents, the Russells (with the help of a future Flash, John Fox), sent the then-infant Iris to the past, where she was adopted by Ira West, her "death" caused a paradox that was resolved after the Russells placed her consciousness into a new body. Barry is reunited with Iris in her time,<ref>''Flash'' #350  (October 1985)</ref> and they are able to spend a month together. However, the couple knows if Barry returns to the past, he will die in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref>As depicted in ''Crisis in Infinite Earths'' #8 (November 1985)</ref> During their time together, they conceive the [[Tornado Twins]], Don and Dawn. Don marries the descendant of Professor Zoom, [[Meloni Thawne]], hoping to end the feud between the two families. They have a son, Bart, whose powers manifest at an early age and cause him to age at an accelerated rate. Don and Dawn die saving 30th Century [[Earth]] from an invasion by the [[Dominators]]. Iris takes Bart to the past to enlist the aid of her nephew (by then, Wally had taken the mantle of the Flash) in saving her grandson. After Bart's accelerated aging slows down, he takes the name of Impulse. Not much is known about her after that, but Iris volunteers to take care of the [[Weather Wizard]]'s orphaned son. Wally West later names [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|his daughter]] Iris in honor of his aunt.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
A mysterious hooded figure enlists the help of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 3, #10</ref> to attack Bart while he confronts [[Captain Cold]], and later reveals herself as Iris. Her plan is to somehow put her grandson, who, by then, had taken up the Flash mantle, out of commission for a week to protect him from a future she is determined to change. Unfortunately, a weakened Bart is killed by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], thanks to an elaborate plan by his clone "brother" [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]].<ref>''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #13</ref>

In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, Iris is seen tearfully looking over photographs of her late husband, when a disembodied voice calls her name. Barry returns to life in ''DC Universe'' #0 and ''Final Crisis'' #2. Iris spends some time as part of a Darkseid-resistance cell operating out of the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. Other members include [[Linda Park]] and her two children. In ''Final Crisis'' #4, Iris is shown to have been corrupted by the [[Anti-Life Equation]]; Barry is able to break its hold over her by kissing her and enveloping her in the [[Speed Force]]. Iris starts crying at the sight of Barry, who reassures her everything will be okay.

After [[The Flash: Rebirth|the return of her husband]], Iris is shown fully returning to her life alongside the rest of the Flash family. Still overjoyed by the return of Barry, she does not get much time to spend with him, as Barry is still mentally scarred from his deathly ordeal and staunchly refuses to stop and enjoy even a moment of "normal" life.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> She is also shown to be much younger than she previously had appearred, later implied by the resurrected Professor Zoom that Iris's currently youthful appearance is a side effect of closet contact to her husband's Speed Force since ''Final Crisis''. She resumes her career as a crime reporter at Central City.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 3, #1 (April 2010)</ref>

===DC Relaunch===
In September 2011, the Flash title was rebooted with a new continuity. In this new timeline, Iris is not married to Barry, but they  still know each other  because of their respective occupations. It is hinted that Iris has a romantic attraction to Barry. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Wally discovers that both he and his aunt Iris possess the 'metagene' that gave the former his powers when the gene was triggered by the lightning bolt in the lab that gave him his superspeed. The novel indicates that Iris's metagene has never manifested itself with any remarkable powers, although the potential is there under the right circumstances.
