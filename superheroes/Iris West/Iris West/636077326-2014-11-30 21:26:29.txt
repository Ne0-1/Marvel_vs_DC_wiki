==Fictional character biography==
In her first appearance, Iris is a reporter for the ''Picture News'', based in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], and the girlfriend of Barry Allen, who is secretly the Flash. Unaware of his secret, Iris often chides Barry for his frequently being late. Eventually, she learns that Barry is not only the city's heroic speedster, but her nephew, Wally West, is [[Kid Flash]]. In ''Flash'' #165 (November 1966), she marries Barry, discovering on their wedding night that Barry is the Flash (through Barry talking in his sleep).  During this time, the couple discovers that Iris was born in the 30th Century ([[circa]] 2945 AD), and had been sent back to the present shortly before "Earth-East" attacked "Earth-West," when Central City was a self-contained city. After years as a prominent presence in the Flash's life and Central City, she is killed by [[Professor Zoom]] during a costume party. Zoom vibrated his hand into her head, solidifying it just enough to kill her.<ref>''Flash'' #275  (July 1979), ''Flash'' #283 (March 1980).</ref><ref name="dc-flas">{{Citation|last = Jimenez|first = Phil|author-link = Phil Jimenez|contribution = The Flash|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 124–127|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Years later, Barry killed Zoom while trying to prevent him from murdering Barry Allen's new fiancee, Fiona Webb.<ref>''Flash'' #324 (August 1983).</ref>

Iris did not stay dead for long. As Iris' biological parents, the Russells (with the help of a future Flash, John Fox), sent the then-infant Iris to the past, where she was adopted by Ira West, her "death" caused a paradox that was resolved after the Russells placed her consciousness into a new body. Barry is reunited with Iris in her time,<ref>''Flash'' #350  (October 1985)</ref> and they are able to spend a month together. However, the couple knows if Barry returns to the past, he will die in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.<ref>As depicted in ''Crisis in Infinite Earths'' #8 (November 1985)</ref> During their time together, they conceive the [[Tornado Twins]], Don and Dawn. Don marries the descendant of Professor Zoom, [[Meloni Thawne]], hoping to end the feud between the two families. They have a son, Bart, whose powers manifest at an early age and cause him to age at an accelerated rate. Dawn marries Jeven Ognats of Aarok and has a daughter, Jenni. Her powers eventually manifest when she witnesses her father being tortured, and she becomes [[XS (comics)|XS]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Don and Dawn die saving 30th Century [[Earth]] from an invasion by the [[Dominators]]. Iris takes Bart to the past to enlist the aid of her nephew (by then, Wally had taken the mantle of the Flash) in saving her grandson. After Bart's accelerated aging slows down, he takes the name of Impulse. Not much is known about her after that, but Iris volunteers to take care of the [[Weather Wizard]]'s orphaned son. Wally West later names [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|his daughter]] Iris in honor of his aunt.

A mysterious hooded figure enlists the help of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]<ref>''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #10</ref> to attack Bart while he confronts [[Captain Cold]], and later reveals herself as Iris. Her plan is to somehow put her grandson, who, by then, had taken up the Flash mantle, out of commission for a week to protect him from a future she is determined to change. Unfortunately, a weakened Bart is killed by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], thanks to an elaborate plan by his clone "brother" [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]].<ref>''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #13</ref>

In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, Iris is seen tearfully looking over photographs of her late husband, when a disembodied voice calls her name. Barry returns to life in ''DC Universe'' #0 and ''Final Crisis'' #2. Iris spends some time as part of a Darkseid-resistance cell operating out of the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. Other members include Black Lightning, Green Arrow, the Ray, [[Linda Park]] and her two children. In ''Final Crisis'' #4, Iris is shown to have been corrupted by the [[Anti-Life Equation]]; Barry is able to break its hold over her by kissing her and enveloping her in the [[Speed Force]]. Iris starts crying at the sight of Barry, who reassures her everything will be okay.

After [[The Flash: Rebirth|the return of her husband]], Iris is shown fully returning to her life alongside the rest of the Flash family. Still overjoyed by the return of Barry, she does not get much time to spend with him, as Barry is still mentally scarred from his deathly ordeal and staunchly refuses to stop and enjoy even a moment of "normal" life.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> She is also shown to be much younger than she previously had appeared, later implied by the resurrected Professor Zoom that Iris's currently youthful appearance is a side effect of close contact to her husband's Speed Force since ''Final Crisis''. She resumes her career as a crime reporter at Central City.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 3, #1 (April 2010)</ref>

===The New 52===
In September 2011 as part of the DC comics relaunch, the Flash title was rebooted with a new continuity. In this new timeline, Iris is not married to Barry, but they  still know each other  because of their respective occupations. It is hinted that Iris has a romantic attraction to Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' #1</ref> She is accidentally trapped in the Speed Force by [[The Top (comics)|Turbine]], but is freed by Barry's alter-ego.<ref>''The Flash'' #7</ref>  Later issues confirm that she is in love with Barry, though Barry does not yet reciprocate Iris's affections.

As soon as they heard the news' Iris and Barry's family rushed to the hospital but found to their relief that Barry was ok. Barry didn't tell Iris the accident gave him super-speed' since he was still learning how to deal with the whole situation and couldn't make it to the opening night of Iris's art gallery because of it, even though she was hoping he could make it' as her career as an artist was just starting to pick up with her first gallery show. Later on Barry and Iris broke up' because when Barry told her that he wanted to get married, she refused and told him that their relationship was moving too fast and that she wasn't ready for that kind of commitment. After that, even though they still loved each other' Iris made the decision to move to France to make a new start in life for herself. Iris wasn't seen again after that, but she did send a letter from Paris to Barry soon after in the 2nd episode "Out of Control". Barry's friend and co-worker Julio Mendez picked it up and read it to Barry which said that Iris was having a good time in France and was settling into her new home. But Barry  didn't want to see it anymore, and to help him move on from Iris, Julio decided to burn the letter so as not to trouble him any further.

===Justice League Novel/Flash: Stop Motion===
Iris Allen is featured in the Justice League novel ''Flash: Stop Motion'' written by Mark Shultz. The novel explains that Iris and her deceased husband Barry Allen raised Wally West after his parents died. Years later Wally now has to defend his aunt Iris from a mysterious form altering creature called the Superluminoid that can travel faster than the [[speed of light]]. The Superluminoid soon begins a murder spree throughout the U.S. that Wally is not fast enough curtail. Wally later discovers that both he and his aunt Iris possess the 'metagene' which triggered Wally's transformation into a speedster following a lab accident. The novel indicates that Iris' metagene lay dormant, but under the right circumstances like Wally's accident, Iris could also become a speedster.  Coincidently, Iris' deceased husband, the original Flash, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] also possessed the metagene enabling him to become super fast.

The [[antagonist]] of the story, the Superluminoid, is revealed to be a creature developed from Iris' own metagene by various experiments, with its method of superspeed essentially crushing alternate [[timeline]]s. In order to stop it, Wally receives important advice from an entity that is later revealed to be an alternate version of Iris from a reality where she was exposed to a particular set of events that triggered her metagene, this entity temporarily boosting Wally's powers to allow him to subdue the Superluminoid.<ref>The Flash: Stop Motion by Mark Schultz ISBN 0-7434-1713-5</ref>
