==Fictional character biography==
In her first appearance, Iris was a reporter for the ''Picture News'', based in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], and the girlfriend of the chronically late Barry Allen.  Eventually, she learned that Barry was not only the Flash, but her step-nephew, Wally West, was [[Kid Flash]].  In ''Flash'' #165 (November 1966), she married Barry.  During this time, the couple discovered that Iris was born about a thousand years in the future, and had been sent back to the present shortly before "Earth-East" attacked "Earth-West," when Central City was a self-contained city. After years as a prominent presence in the Flash's life and Central City, she was killed by [[Professor Zoom]] during a costume party. Zoom vibrates his hand into her head, solidifying it just enough to kill her.<ref>''Flash'' #275  (July 1979)</ref><ref name="dc-flas">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = The Flash | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 124-127  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Iris did not stay dead for long. As Iris's biological parents, the Russells (with the help of a future Flash, John Fox), sent the then-infant Iris to the past, where she was adopted by Ira West, her "death" caused a paradox that was resolved after the Russells placed her consciousness into a new body. Barry was reunited with Iris in her time, and were able to spend a month together. However, the couple knew if Barry returned to the past, he would die (more specifically, in the catalytic event in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''). During their time together, they conceived the [[Tornado Twins]], Don and Dawn. Don married the descendant of Professor Zoom, [[Meloni Thawne]], hoping to end the feud between the two families.  They had a son, Bart, whose powers manifested at an early age and caused him to age at an accelerated rate. Tragically, Don and Dawn died saving [[30th Century]] [[Earth]] from an invasion by the [[Dominators]]. Iris took Bart to the past to enlist the aid of her nephew (by then, Wally had taken the mantle of the Flash) in saving her grandson. After Bart's accelerated aging slowed down, he went by the name of Impulse. Not much is known about her after that, but Iris volunteered to take care of the [[Weather Wizard]]'s orphaned son.  Wally West later named his daughter Iris in honor of his aunt.

{{main|One Year Later}}
A mysterious hooded figure enlisted the help of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]] <ref> ''The Flash'' (v.3) #10</ref> to attack Bart while he confronted [[Captain Cold]], and later revealed herself as Iris. Her plan is to somehow put her grandson, whom, by then, had taken up the Flash mantle, out of commission for a week to protect him from a future she was determined to change. Unfortunately, a weakened Bart was killed by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], thanks to an elaborate plan by his clone "brother" [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]]. <ref> (''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #13'')</ref> 

In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, Iris is seen tearfully looking over photographs of her late husband, when a disembodied voice calls her name. Barry returns to life in DC Universe #0 and Final Crisis #2.

==Other Media==

*Iris Allen made a guest appearance in the two-hour pilot episode of [[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]] played by actress [[Paula Marshall]]. Here, she is portrayed as Barry's girlfriend, just as she is in the comics, but they break up, and so they do not get married. It's possible that they were intended to be reunited in the second season but the show was canceled after just one season.
*Iris Allen appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]].'' Here she is also portrayed as the wife of [[Barry Allen]].  She is voiced by [[Vicki Lewis]].
