'''''The Demon''''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] series created by prolific [[comic book]] writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]]. The title character, named '''Etrigan''', is an actual [[demon]] from [[Hell]] who usually finds himself allied to the forces of good. Etrigan resembles a squat, muscular human with orange (or yellow) skin, horns, red eyes, and ears resembling bat wings. Kirby's original facial design for the character bears a marked resemblance to a [[Hal Foster]] image, and is likely an [[homage]].

==Character history==
He was originally summoned by the [[Magician|wizard]] [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] as part of a last-ditch defense of [[Camelot]] against the evil witch, [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgana le Fay]]. When it became clear that the kingdom would fall regardless, Merlin sent the demon away and changed him into an immortal human named '''Jason Blood''' to wait until he was summoned. One account [[retcon]]ned this, so that Blood was now an actual human, bonded involuntarily to the demon as his punishment for aiding Morgana le Fay in overthrowing Camelot. Currently the series co-written and pencilled by [[John Byrne]] states that the Demon is a monster possessed with the soul of a human, that being Jason Blood, who only existed to bring out his true demon self only when absolutely necessary.

Centuries later, Jason was called to the crypt of Merlin and discovered a poem that could change him into Etrigan. Unfortunately, he was followed by the long-lived Morgaine who lusts for Merlin's secrets. That led to Etrigan's first major battle, and to the solidification of Morgaine as a major enemy. In addition, he later gained another enemy in [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], a permanently prepubescent mage who creates trouble with his magic.

Some time after his first appearance, Etrigan began speaking entirely in rhyme (the quality of which varied considerably depending on who was writing him at the time). This was explained in-story as the result of a promotion, with the rhyming speech being a badge of his new rank in the infernal hierarchy. [[Alan Moore]] introduced this new feature of Etrigan's dialogue in his run on ''[[Swamp Thing]]''.

The poem that releases Etrigan is:

{{cquote|Yarva Demonicus Etrigan.<br />Change, change the form of man.<br />Free the prince forever damned.<br />Free the might from fleshy mire.<br />Boil the blood in heart of fire.<br />Gone, gone the form of man,<br />Rise the demon Etrigan!''}}

Jason Blood's first transformation into the Demon occurs when reading the inscription on the surface of a stone tomb:

{{cquote|'''Change! Change''', O' form of man!<BR />
Release the might from fleshy mire!<BR />
Boil the blood<BR />
in the heart for fire!<BR />
<BR />
Gone! Gone! -- the form of man --<BR />
'''Rise, the Demon Etrigan!!'''"<BR />
(Demon no. 1 August/September 1972 p. 22)}}<BR />

Generally, only the last two lines are actively recited, and the words have been known to vary slightly; the phrase "''yarva daemonicus etrigan''" has occasionally been used, but not consistently.

The reverse spell is ''"Gone, gone O Etrigan! Rise again'' (or ''once more'') ''the form of man!"'' The spell itself does not need to be recited by Jason or Etrigan to be effective, merely within their range of hearing.  In emergencies when Jason cannot speak (such as one time when he was turned into a fly) writing it is sometimes sufficient to effect the change.  On one occasion, Blood released Etrigan by using a parody of the spell (''"Gone o little man so tame / and rise the demon Whatshisname"'').

==Publication history==
While his first monthly [[comic book]] series was short-lived, and his second was cancelled after five years, Etrigan remains a popular supporting character with occasional additional mini-series. Popular series in which Etrigan has appeared include ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'' (see [[Characters of The Sandman#Minor angels and demons|Characters of ''The Sandman'' - Minor Angels and Demons]]) and ''[[Swamp Thing]]''.

==Other versions==
Set in the same continuity as [[Batman: The Animated Series]], Etrigan first appeared in ''[[The Batman Adventures]] Annual #2'', where he teams up with Batman to fight against [[Ra's al Ghul]].[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/guides/comic/tba/spec.php]

Due to his immortality and friendship with Bruce Wayne, Jason Blood/Etrigan was able to team up with the [[Terry McGinnis|future Batman]] in several issues of the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' comic series, although he never appeared in the actual show. He was featured in "Magic is Everywhere!" (''Batman Beyond'' miniseries # 4 of 6, July 1999) and "Many Flights of Demons Sing Thee To Thy Rest" (''Batman Beyond'' #14, December 2000).

==In other media==
Jason Blood/Etrigan has made a single guest appearance in each of ''[[The New Batman Adventures ]]'' (in which he was voiced by [[Billy Zane]] and fought Klarion) and ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' (in which he was voiced by [[Michael T. Weiss]]). Etrigan does not speak in rhyme in either series.

Blood's appearance on Cartoon Network's "Justice League" in 2002 was significant on several fronts.  In addition to having a new animated voice (Weiss), his look was redesigned by the production team so as to more closely resemble his original Kirby roots. In the two-part story "A Knight of Shadows," his origin was explained in detail: During the siege of Camelot, Blood was bound by Merlin to Etrigan as a punishment for betraying the kingdom to his secret lover, the sorceress Morgaine Le Fey.  While Blood, a nobleman, has been rendered immortal, he must share his soul with a demon for eternity â€” it is his 'curse,' the price of unforgiveable lust. 

Etrigan also appeared as one of the many members of the expanded Justice League in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In one of his most notable appearances, the episode "Kid's Stuff", he was turned into a baby when all adults had been banished to another dimension by Le Fey's son, Mordred. He was restored to normal by the end of the episode and went on to make several more small appearances throughout the series.

==Powers and abilities==
===Etrigan===
Even among demons, Etrigan is considered to be extremely powerful. He has above superhuman strength (mystically enhanced) to the degree of literally punching people to the moon and, being an immortal creature, cannot die. He has a high degree of resistance to injury and can project hellfire from his body; usually from his mouth. He has a very high command of magic: other powers include mystically enhanced fangs and claws, enhanced senses, super speed, agility, telepathy and precognition as well. His healing factor can handle an incredible amount of damage, up to recovering from wounds that have removed large sections of his body. His powers can be extended by other magical devices, such as the Crown of Horns.

Etrigan is also provided with insight to religious aspects and other forbidden or secret knowledge.

===Jason Blood===
Jason Blood is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. His skills include mastery in swordmanship. Jason also is an adept of magic. He has also limited precognition and telepathy.

==Limitations==
Etrigan has all the limitations usually associated with a demon, including a weakness towards iron. His command of magic is strong but considered to be less than his father, Belial, and half-brother, Merlin the Magician. Additionally, Belial granted "power of Etrigan" to both Merlin and another son, Scapegoat.

==Green Arrow and ''Blood of the Demon''==
After emerald archer [[Green Arrow]]'s [[resurrection]] in ''Green Arrow: Quiver'', [[Batman]] and Oliver recruit Blood for his occult knowledge as to how Oliver could have been resurrected. It is found that Oliver is a "Hollow" - a soulless husk of a human, created by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] to soothe his guilt. Blood calls on Etrigan to kill Oliver (being a Hollow leaves him vulnerable to possession, which could have caused Hell to be unleashed on Earth). He is stopped in his attempt by a Fire Extinguisher Arrow. Batman, in response to the unusual weapon, said, "I will never, ever mock your trick arrows again."

The series ''Blood of the Demon'', plotted and drawn by [[John Byrne]], scripted by [[Will Pfeifer]], began May 2005. Etrigan apparently loses the restrictions imposed upon him by the wizard [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] which turned him from evil, caused by his "murder" at the exact moment he was transforming from his human guise Jason Blood into his demon self. It turns out that the incident has resulted in Jason Blood being able to exert some will over Etrigan's violent nature, whereas previously the two remained separate, only one existing at a time.

Etrigan's last book was the monthly ''Blood of the Demon'', which ended with issue #17 in July 2006.
