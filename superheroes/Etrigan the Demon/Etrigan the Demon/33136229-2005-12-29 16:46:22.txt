'''''The Demon''''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] series created by prolific [[comic book]] writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]]. The title character, named '''Etrigan''', is an actual [[demon]] from [[Hell]] who usually finds himself allied to the forces of good. Etrigan resembles a squat, muscular human with orange (or yellow) skin, horns, red eyes, and ears resembling bat wings.  Kirby's original facial design for the character bears a marked resemblance to a [[Hal Foster]] image, and is likely an homage.

==Character History==
He was originally summoned by the [[wizard]] [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] as part of a last-ditch defense of [[Camelot]] against the evil witch, [[Morgan (comics)|Morgan le Fay]].  When it became clear that the kingdom would fall regardless, Merlin sent the demon away and changed him into an immortal human named Jason Blood to wait until he was summoned. Later accounts [[retcon]]ned this, so that Blood is now an actual human, bonded involuntarily to the demon as its jailer.

Centuries later, Jason was called to the crypt of Merlin and discovered a poem that could change him into Etrigan.  Unfortunately, he was followed by the long-lived Morgan who lusts for Merlin's secrets.  That led to Etrigan's first major battle, and to the solidification of Morgan as a major enemy.  In addition, he later gained another enemy in [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], a permanently prepubescent mage who creates trouble with his magic.

Some time after his first appearance, Etrigan began speaking entirely in rhyme (the quality of which varied considerably depending on who was writing him at the time). This was explained in-story as the result of a promotion, with the rhyming speech being a badge of his new rank in the infernal hierarchy.

The poem that releases Etrigan is:
:''Yarva Demonicus Etrigan.''
:''Change, change the form of man.''
:''Free the prince forever damned.''
:''Free the might from fleshy mire. ''
:''Boil the blood in heart of fire. ''
:''Gone, gone the form of man, ''
:''Rise the demon Etrigan!''

Generally, only the last two lines are actively recited, and the words have been known to vary slightly; the phrase "''yarva daemonicus etrigan''" has occasionally been used, but not consistently.

The reverse spell is ''"Gone, gone O Etrigan! Rise again'' (or ''once more'') ''the form of man!"'' The spell itself does not need to be recited by Jason or Etrigan to be effective, merely within their range of hearing and in a pinch, writing it is sometimes sufficient; on one occasion, Blood released Etrigan by using a parody of the spell (''"Gone o little man so tame / and rise the demon Whatsisname"'').

Jason Blood was recruited in the recent past by [[Batman]] to join a temporary [[Justice League]] team.

==Publication History==

While his first monthly [[comic book]] series was short-lived, and his second was cancelled after five years, Etrigan remains a popular supporting character with occasional additional mini-series. Popular series in which Etrigan has appeared include [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]] and [[Swamp Thing]].

Jason Blood/Etrigan has made a single guest appearance in each of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (in which he was voiced by [[Billy Zane]]) and ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' (in which he was voiced by [[Michael T. Weiss]]). Also Etrigan made an appearance as a baby in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and other background character appearances in the episode "Kid Stuff". The animated television version of Etrigan does not speak in rhyme except when reciting the spell that changes him between his human and demon identities.

Currently Etrigan appears in the monthly ''Blood of the Demon'', which some readers feel is similar to the TV series ''[[Angel (TV series)]]'' in tone, of which co-writer and penciller [[John Byrne]] is a fan.  DC has indicated that the series will continue to run to at least issue 18 (issue #10 having been published in December 2005).

== Powers and Abilities ==
===Etrigan===
Even amongst demons, Etrigan is considered to be extremely powerful. He has above superhuman strength (mystically enhanced). He has the ability to fly, a high degree of resistance to injury and can project hellfire from his body; usually from his mouth. He has a very high command of magic. He also has insight to religious aspects and other forbidden or secret knowledge. He is an expert hand to hand combatant. His healing factor can handle an incredible amount of damage, up to recovering from wounds that have removed large sections of his body. He is Immortal and therefore cannot die. Like most demons he has enhanced senses. He has mystically enhanced fangs and claws. He is a demon of high rank, which boosts his powers tremendously. He has super speed and agility. Telepathy and Precognition. His powers can be extended by other magical devices, such as the Crown of Horns.

===Jason===
Jason is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. His skills include a mastery in swordmanship. Jason also is an adept of magic. While undetermined, it's accepted that it's much less than Merlin or Etrigan. He has precognition and telepathy.

== Limitations ==
Etrigan has all the limitations usually associated with a demon, including a weakness towards iron. His command of magic is strong but considered to be less than his father, Belial, and half-brother, Merlin the Magician. Additionally, Belial granted "power of Etrigan" to both Merlin and another son, Scapegoat.

== ''Blood of the Demon'' ==
'''''Blood of the Demon''''' is an ongoing [[comic book]] series plotted and drawn by [[John Byrne]], and scripted by [[Will Pfeifer]]. It commenced its run with a print publication date of May 2005. The series is published by [[DC Comics]].  It features the DC character ''[[Demon (comics)|The Demon]]'', also named Etrigan, originally created by prolific comic book writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]]. The character is an actual demon from Hell who usually finds himself allied to the forces of good.

===Synopsis===
{{spoiler}}
The series begins with Etrigan apparently losing the restrictions imposed upon him by the wizard [[Merlin]] which turned him from evil, caused by his "murder" at the exact moment he was transforming from his human guise Jason Blood into his demon self.  It turns out that the incident has resulted in Jason Blood being able to exert some will over Etrigan to seek to harness the 
demon's violent nature, whereas previously the two remained separate, one only existing at a time.
