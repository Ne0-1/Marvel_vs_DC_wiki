'''Venus''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], based on the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] ([[Aphrodite]]) from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]; however, it is later revealed that she is a [[Siren]] and not the true goddess. The Marvel version of the character first appeared in ''Venus'' #1 (Aug. 1948), and made her first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] appearance in ''[[Sub-Mariner]]''  #57 (Jan. 1973).

==Publication history==
In the original 1940s ''Venus'' series, Venus dwelled on the planet [[Venus]] with her [[handmaiden|female companions]]. She traveled to Earth and took on the human identity of Victoria "Vicki" Starr, a journalist and editor for ''Beauty'' magazine. She developed a romantic relationship with ''Beauty'' editor Whitney Hammond; he and Venus's rival Della Mason were among the few people to meet Venus who did not believe her when she claimed that she was a goddess. The series began as a light-hearted humor/fantasy series, but as the series continued, its focus shifted towards darker fantasy and horror themes. Through the course of the series, the Marvel Comics interpretations of several mythological figures appeared, including Hercules and Zeus and various other Olympians, Satan, and in their first Marvel appearance, the Norse gods [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. ''Venus'' was canceled with issue #19.

The character drifted into obscurity after her series ended, and Venus did not reappear again for 25 years, when she resurfaced in an issue of the [[Sub-Mariner]]'s comic book. Venus manipulated Namor into defeating [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], who was attempting to [[rape|force her to love him]].<ref name="Sub-Mariner #57">''Sub-Mariner'' #57</ref> Venus was now a guide for young [[activist]]s such as [[Namorita]], searching for ways to promote peace, and [[anti-war|to end modern warfare]]. At this time, she wore only a [[swimsuit]] or a [[toga|revealing white gown]].

==Fictional character biography==
Venus is the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian]] goddess of love and beauty who is [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' daughter by the minor goddess Dione.  Venus wears an enchanted girdle called the Cestus which enables her to arouse love and passion in others at will and to transform weapons into objects that can be used for peaceful purposes.

In recent decades, she has used the secret identity on Earth of humanities professor Victoria N. Starr as a cover for her activates as an adventurer, but she is now back on [[Olympus (comics)|Olympus]].

For the most part, her subsequent appearances featured her alongside other Greek deities, and did not reference the character's history from her own series. She appeared in modern times on Earth disguised as a mortal on a mission of peace. She was pursued by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], though defended by [[Namor]], however she surrendered the Cestus to Ares.<ref name="Sub-Mariner #57"/> She was later commanded by [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] to become the bride of Ares as part of Pluto's bid to overthrow Zeus. However, Venus opposed them alongside the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]], and subdued Queen [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]] non-violently.<ref>''Champions'' #1-3</ref> She later aided the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to quell the rage of Zeus over [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]'s beating by mortals.<ref>''Avengers'' #283-284</ref>

The series ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' revealed that Venus and several other heroes who had been active in the 1950s briefly banded together, but did not remain as a team. This team has recently re-banded in [[Agents of Atlas]] and Venus has rejoined the team.

Venus's true origins were revealed by Namora: this Venus was actually a soulless [[Siren]] that lured sailing ships to her with her voice and fed on the sailors. To prevent his ship and his crew from being feed on, the captain of a merchant ship hired a mystic to kill her. The mystic instead gave her a soul. The Siren then took the form of a beautiful woman (forbidding herself to speak again) and was taken in by a nunnery, where she lived for decades and believed herself a mute servant girl, until she joined a chorus, filling the visiting clergy with lust. She was then expelled from the nunnery. Learning how to use her voice for good, she blocked out all memories of her previous life and assumed that she was Venus reborn, based on the legends she had heard about a beautiful, immortal girl wandering the world as a goddess in a human body and winning her battles with the power of "love".{{Issue|date=October 2009}} ‘Venus’ resurfaced in the 1940s and acted as a superhero. After learning the truth about her past, Venus fell into depression and filled all of her companions with despair.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} With [[Jimmy Woo]]'s help, she reconnected with her past life and regained all of the abilities she possessed as a Siren.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' (v.1) #5</ref>

She had since accepted to stay with the ''Agents of Atlas'', using her restored powers to soothe and calm her opponents, while traveling around the world in Marvel Boy's ship, along with her fellow teammates, shutting down the villainous branch of the former ''Atlas Foundation''.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' (v.1) #6</ref> She eventually came up with the idea to alter [[Spider-Man]]'s perception of a common fight, leaving him with false memories of having helped someone else instead of [[mindwiping]] him.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Subsequently, she was abducted by the true Olympian goddess Aphrodite, angry at her for assuming her name and guise.<ref>''X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Venus has the power to project images or illusions of herself and to control the emotions of others, as well as the ability to fly at high speeds, shield herself from mortal sight, and shift her physical form into other beings, even dolphins. She is an Olympian goddess, and possesses the enhanced physical characteristics typical of Olympian gods in the Marvel Universe, including superhuman stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, extraordinary vitality, and virtual immortality. Venus is extraordinarily beautiful, perfectly proportioned, and possesses no physical flaws whatsoever. By the standards of western civilization of Earth, she is the epitome of female beauty and one of the most aesthetically perfect female beings in existence.

Venus possesses a magical girdle named Cestus that enables the wearer to enchant anyone to become a love-slave, and to neutralize or transform all weapons of war. [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]] designed this girdle for Venus.

After her memories were restored, Venus gained a powerful "siren song", able to heal and restore, curing people's souls by giving them a moment of true bliss in which they can live their most prized fantasy. Her voice is mystically empowered with advanced mind-control abilities, related to her mood: when she speaks in joy, she fills her listeners with bliss and fanatical love for her; when she cries in sadness, her listeners drown in despair too. Her power was strong enough to immediately subdue the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] into helping her find [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] during [[Dark Reign]]. Like many characters with vocal-based abilities, it has been shown that Venus' siren song can be disabled if she is gagged.<ref>''X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas'' #1</ref>
