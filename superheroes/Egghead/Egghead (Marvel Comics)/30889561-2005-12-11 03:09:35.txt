'''Egghead''' is a fictional Marvel comics' villain who first appeared in [[Tales to Astonish]]# 38. He is also the arch-nemesis of super-hero [[Henry Pym]].

A gifted government research scientist, Elihas Starr was dismissed for espionage and resolved to use his intellect for criminal gain. He was dealt a humiliating initial defeat by Ant-Man (Hank Pym), and divided his remaining years between attempted world conquest and seeking revenge on Pym.

Egghead was obsessed with Hank Pym, and also had several run-ins with Pym's teammates from the Avengers and the Defenders--notably Hawkeye, whose brother, Barney Barton, died aiding the Avengers against Egghead. Ironically, it was Hawkeye who caused Egghead's accidental death years later, in a battle with Egghead's Masters of Evil: the defeated Egghead was about to shoot Hank Pym in the back out of spite, but Hawkeye shot an arrow into Egghead's gun barrel. The gun misfired, killing Egghead.
