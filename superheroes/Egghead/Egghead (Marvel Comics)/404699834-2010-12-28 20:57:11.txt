'''Egghead''' is the name of two fictional [[Marvel Comics]] villains. The original first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #38. He is also the arch-nemesis of super-hero [[Henry Pym]]. The second first appeared in ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1

==Fictional character biography==
'''Elihas Starr''' was born in [[Queens, New York]]. A gifted government research atomic scientist, Starr was dismissed for espionage and resolved to use his intellect as a criminal mastermind. He was dealt a humiliating initial defeat by [[Henry Pym|Ant-Man]] (Hank Pym), whom he was sent to battle on behalf of underworld figures.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #38</ref> Egghead divided his remaining years between attempted world conquest and seeking revenge on Pym, often hiding out in the [[Bowery]] section of [[Manhattan]] in between.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | date = 2007  | location = New York City  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-14653-141-6  | page = 18}}</ref>

Egghead allied with the [[Mad Thinker]] and the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]] in a plot to use a laser satellite to blackmail the United States government.<ref>''Avengers'' #63</ref> He caused the death of Barney Barton, brother of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], who was aiding the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers'' #64</ref> hired the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]] to kidnap Henry Pym, and battled Clint Barton who had recently adopted Pym's previous identity of [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]].<ref>''Avengers'' #65</ref>

Egghead later kidnapped his niece, Trish Starr, in order to test a device which allowed him to steal other people's intelligence, and wound up battling Henry Pym, as Ant-Man again.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #5</ref> He would later cause her car to explode, causing her to lose an arm.<ref>''Giant Size Defenders'' #4</ref> He then formed the [[Emissaries of Evil]] in an attempt to gain possession of the mystic artifact the Eye of Capistan. This team consisted of the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Cobalt Man]], and [[Solarr]]. Egghead and the Emissaries battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #42-43</ref> Egghead also fought [[Spider-Man]] on different occasions.

Egghead was obsessed with Hank Pym, and engineered his disgrace. Egghead approached Pym, who was operating as Yellowjacket at the time, with a prosthetic arm that he wished to give to Trish in order make amends for his previous deeds. After the arm was installed, Egghead informed Pym that the arm contained a bomb that would be detonated unless Pym complied with Egghead's commands. Egghead had Pym attempt to rob a national treasury of [[adamantium]], and Pym was caught and arrested by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #217</ref> With Pym apparently out of the way, Egghead then formed the third [[List of Masters of Evil members#Masters of Evil III|Masters of Evil]] as part of a plot against the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #222</ref>

Egghead then sent his Masters of Evil to kidnap Pym from his trial, making it appear as if Pym himself had staged his rescue. The attempt was successful, and Egghead instructed Pym to construct an anti-aging device. Subsequently, Pym goaded Egghead into letting him test the machine himself. However, the device turned out to be a weapon system, and he single-handedly defeated the assembled Masters. The Avengers arrived too late to be of assistance, but Hawkeye arrived at the laboratory in time to see the defeated Egghead about to shoot Hank in the back out of spite with his energy blaster. Hawkeye shot an arrow into Egghead's gun barrel. The gun misfired, causing an accidental explosion of the energy pistol which killed Egghead, ironically and inadvertently avenging the death of Hawkeye's brother by Egghead's hands years ago.<ref>''Avengers'' #228-229</ref>

Also, in ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' #0, distributed by Wizard Magazine, Deadpool fought and killed a resurrected Egghead, who then had a small bird pop out of his skull.

In ''[[Fall of the Hulks]]: Alpha,'' a flashback showed that Egghead was a member of [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Although he had no superhuman powers of his own, Egghead's incredible genius intellect made him a formidable foe. He was particularly skilled in the fields of robotics and engineering, and could absorb new ideas and knowledge at a seemingly superhuman rate. He had a degree in atomic science, and extensive knowledge in a wide variety of scientific and technological disciplines. Starr designed a wide variety of sophisticated weapons and technological paraphernalia. 

==Young Masters==
A new Egghead, this version a robot, appears as a member of the new [[Young Avengers]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1</ref> Although his original programming was "to respect all human life," Big Zero, a female neo-nazi who seems to have a relationship with this Egghead, has reprogrammed him to hate several minorities.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' {{Issue|date=October 2009}}</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
As of ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1 Egghead II's powers have not been fully revealed. He has so far demonstrated the ability to fly and the power to phase his hand through a person's skull.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Egghead appeared in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' episode titled "Egg-Stream Vengeance" voiced by [[Robert Latimer]]. Disguised as a long-legged clown at a Thanksgiving Day Parade, Egghead tampered with Hank Pym's "Pym Particles" by blowing special bubbles at him while he was fighting a brought to life dinosaur float. When he arrives at Avengers Mansion with the press, he used a countermeasure to restore Ant-Man to his rightful height but later caused him to shrink. While Wasp stays behind to watch over Ant-Man, the other Avengers went out to hunt Egghead. After Scarlet Witch deactivated the security system around Egghead's house, the other Avengers managed to apprehend Egghead and bring him to Avengers Mansion. When Ant-Man was cured by Wasp, he sprayed Egghead with his own serum with half-life Pym Particals that will leave him small for a few hours. Hawkeye manages to trap Egghead in a jar and give him to the arriving police officers as Scarlet Witch gives them Egghead's recorded confession.

* Egghead appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "This Forest Green" voiced by [[Wayne Knight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm |title=Comics Continuum |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref> After [[MODOK]] and [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] botched up the recent Infinity Fractal retrieval, Doctor Doom assigns Egghead to help them get into the Helicarrier in Egghead's shrinking pod. In "Election of Evil," Egghead runs against the Mayor of Super Hero City and wins using a mind-control device hidden in his tie. He then sets up rules that end up causing problems for the superheroes. Doctor Doom tells Egghead to work on the bills that will unlock the gate to Villainville only to be defeated by Wolverine.
