'''Egghead''' is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]]' villain who first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #38. He is also the arch-nemesis of super-hero [[Henry Pym]].

== Character History ==

A gifted government research scientist, '''Elihas Starr''' was dismissed for espionage and resolved to use his intellect for criminal gain. He was dealt a humiliating initial defeat by Ant-Man (Hank Pym), and divided his remaining years between attempted world conquest and seeking revenge on Pym.

Egghead was obsessed with Hank Pym, and also had several run-ins with Pym's teammates from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] &mdash; notably [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], whose brother, Barney Barton, died aiding the Avengers against Egghead.

Egghead also fought [[Spider-Man]] on different occasions.

Ironically, it was Hawkeye who caused Egghead's accidental death years later, in a battle with Egghead's [[Masters of Evil#Masters of Evil III|Masters of Evil]]: the defeated Egghead was about to shoot Hank Pym in the back out of spite, but Hawkeye shot an arrow into Egghead's gun barrel. The gun misfired, killing Egghead.

==Powers and Abilities==

Although he had no superhuman powers of his own, Egghead's incredible intellect made him a formidable foe. He was particularly skilled in the fields of robotics and engineering, and could absorb new ideas and knowledge at a superhuman rate.

==Other Media==
Egghead appeared in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' episode titled "Egg-Stream Vengeance." In that episode, he tampered with Hank Pym's "Pym Particles."
