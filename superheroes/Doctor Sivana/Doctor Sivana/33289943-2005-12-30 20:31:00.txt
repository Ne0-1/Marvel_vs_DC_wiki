'''Doctor Thaddeus Bodog Sivana''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillian]].  Created by [[Bill Parker]] and [[C.C. Beck]], he first appeared opposite [[superhero]]  [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 ([[February]] [[1940]]) by [[Fawcett Comics]].  Sivana was soon established as Captain Marvel's archenemy and most frequent foe, a role that he continues to hold to this day in his appearances in [[DC Comics]], who eventually acquired the rights to those characters from Fawcett.

The former [[CEO]] of Sivana Industries, Sivana is a short, bald, self-described "[[mad scientist]]" with a penchant for developing unusual technologies, and who often plots to do away with Captain Marvel and his [[Marvel Family]], but is often thwarted in his plans.  His trademark phrases are "Curses! Foiled again!" and his mocking laughter "Heh! Heh! Heh!"  He also coined the insulting name "Big Red Cheese" to refer to Captain Marvel, a name which the Captain's friends have adopted to light-heartedly tease him with.  

Originally, Sivana had four children: good-natured adult offspring '''Beautia''' and '''Magnificus''', and evil teenagers '''Georgia''' and Thaddeus, Jr. (aka '''Sivana, Jr.''') Sivana, Sivana, Jr., and Georgia constitued the supervillian group '''The Sivana Family''', the evil counterpoint to the Marvel Family. Magnificus and Beautia, however, were not enemies to the Marvels; in fact, Beautia has an unrequited crush on Captain Marvel (who she does not realize is really an adolescent boy, Billy Batson). In [[post-Crisis]] [[DC Universe]] continuty, Magnificus and Beautia are Sivana's only children, and Georgia and Sivana, Jr. have been [[retcon]]ned out of existence.

In his most recent plot in modern DC continuity, which was depicted in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #13 -15 ([[August]]-[[October]] [[2004]]), Sivana freed the surviving members of supervillian group The [[Fearsome Five]] ([[Gizmo]], [[Mammoth]], [[Psimon]] and [[Jinx]]) from prison, and used his genius to reconstitute [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]], who had been turned into glass and shattered by Psimon.  After reforming the team, Sivana had Psimon and Jinx steal [[stock]] from Lexcorp, the corporation owned by [[Lex Luthor]], and then had the Five attack and destroy several large Lexcorp properties and all the employees working at them, including the corporate building in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], L.N.N., Lexcorp's [[cable television|cable]] [[news]] network, and one of the [[microchip]] processor factories of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor.  After doing this, the criminally unsophisiticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missle]] facility near [[Joshua Tree]].  When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again.  It was later revealed that Sivana had 75 [[shell corporation|shell companies]] to [[short selling|short sell]] the Lexcorp stock, and spent the money he made from the scheme to purchase a [[tropical]] island forty miles off the coast of [[Thailand]] to use as his lair.

Sivana recently appeared along with [[Lex Luthor]] in the four-issue [[2005]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Superman]]/[[Shazam]]: First Thunder'' by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Joshua Middleton]], which depicts the historic first meeting between the those two superheroes.
