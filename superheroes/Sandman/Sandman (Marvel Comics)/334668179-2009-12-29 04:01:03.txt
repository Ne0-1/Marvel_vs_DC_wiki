'''Sandman''' ('''William Baker''', a.k.a. '''Flint Marko''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (Sept. [[1963 in comics|1963]]), created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] as an adversary for [[Spider-Man]]. A [[List of comic book superpowers#Shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] endowed through an accident with the ability to turn himself into sand, he eventually reformed, and became an ally of Spider-Man. The character has been adapted into various other media incarnations of Spider-Man, including animated cartoons and the 2007 film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', in which he is played by [[Academy Award]] nominated actor [[Thomas Haden Church]].

==Fictional character biography==
William Baker was born in [[Queens, New York]]. At three years old his father abandoned him and his mother, a cleaning lady. In these early years she took her son to [[Coney Island]] beach, where he lost himself happily in sand sculptures, a craft he would use in secondary school under the encouragement of a teacher of his, Miss Flint, his first crush.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1">[[Peter David|David, Peter]]; ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual'' #1; July 2007</ref>  

In preparatory school, a boy named Vic and his two pals bullied William until he, William, learned to fight using opponents' motions against themselves, a technique he performed as if he "slipped through their fingers like sand." Vic and his buddies posed no match to William, who wore them down and who they befriend throughout high school, even. At this time, William, a football player on his school's team, used football to channel his anger to apply it to what he sensed as an emergent physiological change in himself. While playing football he adopted the moniker "Flint," the last name of his affection, Miss Flint.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/>  

Vic incurs a large debt to a [[mafia|mob]]. In desperation he begs Flint to fix a football game he bet on to pay off his debt. Flint does but finds himself kicked off the team after his coach discovers Flint's involvement in this corruption. The coach vituperates the young, tenderfoot trickster saying that he would accomplish nothing of import in his life. Flint soon roughs up his ex-coach, resulting in his expulsion from school and segue into a life of crime.

His illegal activity increases in depth and scope, turning him into a violent, bitter man. Eventually he ends up imprisoned on [[Ryker's Island]], where he meets his father, Floyd Baker. He's friendly to his father but doesn't tell him who he is. He tells Floyd his nickname, Flint, and a false surname, Marko, inspired by his former coach’s taunts about not "making a mark" on the world. Thereon he would use the alias Flint Marko.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/> (He changed his name also to prevent his mother from discovering he's a criminal.<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]; ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #86; April 1982</ref>) His father's presence ameliorates him. After Floyd is released from prison, Marko plots to escape.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/> He does.

Immediately William flees to a [[nuclear testing]] site on a beach near [[Savannah, Georgia]] where he comes into contact with sand that had been [[radiation|irradiated]] by an experimental reactor. His body and the radioactive sand [[chemical bond|bond]], which changes Marko's [[molecule|molecular]] structure into sand. Impressed, he names himself the Sandman after his new powers. 

In high school Marko clashes with Peter Parker, or [[Spider-Man]], for the first time. Spider-Man defeats Marko with a vacuum cleaner <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #4</ref>. He escaped, but was recaptured by the Human Torch. After a while the troubled youth resurfaces as a member of the [[Sinister Six]], led by [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> Alongside the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], he captures the [[Human Torch]] but later succumbs to Spider-Man and the Human Torch.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #19</ref> After Spider-Man defeats Flint numerous times, Flint diverts his attention to other super heroes. He teams with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], [[Trapster|Paste Pot Pete]] and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] to form the [[Frightful Four]] to combat the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Fantastic Four with the help of a few other super heroes pound this fledgling group.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #36</ref> In another battle he loses against the Four, he dons a [[diamond]]-patterned green costume with a purple cap and is joined by [[Blastaar]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #61-62</ref> Later he and Incredible [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] duel for the first time. [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] joins him in his next conflict against the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #113-114</ref>

In time Sandman discovers—starting with his hands—his body can transform into [[glass]] and that he can reverse that effect. He contracted cancer and overtook a medical research center. He battled [[Wonder Man]] but was cured of cancer by radiation.<ref>''Wonder Man'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> Afterward, he allied himself with [[Hydro-Man]] to battle their mutual enemy, Spider-Man. An accident merged the two villains into a muddle-headed mud monster whose rampage was short-lived when Spider-Man and the police dehydrated the monstrosity.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #217-218</ref> Months later Sandman separated himself from Hydro-Man. 

Depression sinks into Baker in an episode he's having second thoughts about evil. The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] of the Fantastic Four sees Baker's angst and urges him to straighten himself out, to use his ability to do good.<ref>''Mavel Two-in-One'' #86</ref> He began boarding with the Cassadas and teamed with Spider-Man against the Enforcers.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #138</ref> Sandman then makes sporadic appearances in various Spider-Man comics assisting his former enemy. The first such appearance has him coming to the rescue of Spider-Man and [[Silver Sable]], who are outnumbered and surrounded by the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. Silver Sable is impressed by Sandman's performance and recruits him as a freelance operative.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #280-281</ref> Doctor Octopus coerced him to rejoin Sinister Six, but he turned against the clan, whose leader, Doctor Octopus, turned him into glass for his treason. Spider-man, however, saved the Sandman.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #334, 338-339</ref> Sandman also appears as part of the [[Outlaws (comics)|Outlaws]], a group of reformed Spider-Man enemies, such as [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]], [[Rocket Racer]], [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] and [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]], on occasion that would aid Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #169</ref> 

Later he receives a presidential pardon and briefly joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a reserve member.<ref>''Avengers'' #329</ref> Later, he becomes a fulltime [[mercenary]] in the employ of [[Silver Sable]], as a member of her [[Wild Pack]], serving alongside heroes such as [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Sandman is one of the few heroes temporarily overwhelmed by their evil doubles during the [[Infinity War]]. This double almost kills the entire Pack.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}
  
Marko eventually reverts to his villainous ways, claiming to have faked his heroic career. In a twist in events, it is exposed the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] has used his mind controlling "Id Machine" to coerce Marko to act as a villain.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Sandman then joins an incarnation of Sinister Six that works with one of Spider-Man's deadliest foes, [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. In an effort to make sure he destroys Spider-Man, Venom attacks his cohorts. During Venom's brawl against Sandman, the vicious black spider's mouth rips out a chunk of sand from Sandman. That missing sand destabilizes Sandman, who then crumbles and, because of it, blames Spider-Man for it but asks him to deliver to his mother a message that contains among his concerns his regret not being a super hero. Sandman washes away and slides down a sewer, from which he mixes into [[Jones Beach, New York]] <ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #22</ref> and is thought dead.

Sandman's body and mind are scattered throughout the beach. Here, on this beach, he recoups. His consciousness attracts sand to reform himself and beach goers scramble to avoid being sucked into the sand vortex, him. During this reformation Sandman experiences many mindsets that conflict each other. This conflict proves too powerful for him to control, causing him to ruin his reformation by exploding himself unintentionally.  

[[Image:Amazing Spider-Man 615.jpg|145px|Sandman shows off new powers ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #615. Art by [[Javier Pulido]].|right|thumb]]

His sand wafts throughout New York and touches down into piles forming beings that personify him: the good, the bad/evil (and the ugly), the feminine and the childlike. Spider-Man locates these sandmen to convince them to return to one being. Sandman's evil persona merges with his child and feminine personas, but Sandman's good one rebuffs evil's attempt to enjoin him. Because Sandman is incomplete, he crumbles and blows away. Somehow the good persona of Sandman remains. Odd, however, is that even though Sandman isn't the sadistic monstrosity he was, his nature is absent to do good.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #56-57</ref>

Sandman is one of the villains recruited to recover the [[Identity Disc]], but during its recovery seemingly he is killed in a mutiny. At the series' end Sandman is found alive and working with Vulture to manipulate the other villains.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In the storyline "Sandblasted," in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #17-19 ([[April 2007|April]]-[[June 2007]]), Sandman asks Spider-Man for help in clearing the name of his father, who has been charged with and imprisoned for murdering a [[homeless]] man. He admits his father was a petty criminal but insists he wouldn't commit murder. Baker also said the victim resembles Peter Parker's [[Uncle Ben]], who had been murdered years before then. Sandman and Spider-Man find the killer, [[Chameleon (comics)#Chameleon 2211|Chameleon 2211]]. Chameleon 2211 kills Uncle Ben who [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211|Hobgoblin 2211]] brought from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #8</ref> and had been posing as him after that. Thanks to Spider-Man, Floyd Baker is switched with Chameleon 2211 and saved, for which Sandman is grateful to Spider-Man.

Sandman is set to return in ''[[Spider-Man: Enter the Gauntlet]]'' according to writer [[Fred Van Lente]]; although Sandman will remain a sympathetic character, his attempt to "try to keep something closely him and never let it go. Unfortunately, his route to that goal brings him into direct conflict with Spider-Man." Also he will reach new levels of power with the ability to split into multiple persons at a time as shown on the cover of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #615.<ref>http://comics.ign.com/articles/102/1026877p1.html</ref>

Spider-Man enters an investigation involving [[Carlie Cooper]], three murders, and a missing girl named Keemia. Someone manages to steal three top secret files involving three murders and strangely enough there were grains of sand on them. Spider-Man, with the help of Betty Brant, traces the murderer to Governor's Island, where he believes the antagonist is hiding and keeping Keemia. Surely enough he runs into none other than the Sandman who has a new trick up his sleeve.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #615</ref> Spider-Man webs Keemia to his back and is pursued by many Sandmen around Governor's Island until some of them confess that they had murdered Keemia's mother and two others. Flint Marko is shocked that his own dublicates were able to free themselves from his control and began battling himself. Spider-Man sneaks away and obliterates Sandman with a fan, and gets back to Manhatten via The Brooklyn/Battery Tunnel. Originally Spider-Man believed that Keemia would be handed to her grandmother, but instead she was sent to a foster home. Carlie gets exonerated and Sandman is out there somewhere.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #616</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the result of accidental radiation bombardment during his cancer treatment,{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Marko transforms into a malleable, solid substance, a man made of sand, the Sandman. 

He has the ability to transform his body. He can will his body hardened, compacted, dispersed or shaped, or a combination of those qualities, an [[List of comic book superpowers#Earth manipulation|Earth manipulation]] of sand and rock particles. More often than not in combat, this ability enables him to absorb most blows with little to no ill effect other than reforming himself, a relatively fast action. His striped shirt and cargo pants are colored sand to make him appear as if he wears clothes. Even when soaked, he was able to stretch his sand molecules, growing to double his size. 

Sandman can mold his arms and hands into shapes such as a [[Mace (club)|mace]] or a [[sledgehammer]] to battle Spider-Man and his other enemies. His mass, strength and shape shifting ability correspond to the number of sand and rock particles that comprise him. The more he incorporates (nearby) sand grains and rock granules into his body, the more those qualities are enhanced. Even though he controls every particle in his body, his mind exists in the astral plane. He can turn himself into a [[sandstorm]], which enables him to fly great distances and to suffocate his enemies.

His body takes on sand's chemical qualities, impervious to many, but not all, elements. Once, cement's ingredients were mixed into Sandman. That mixture turned him into cement that dried, rendering him immobile. Despite this frailty, he remained alive but in a [[coma]]like state for a while before he returned to normal.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} In addition to his superb endurance, the Sandman possesses superhuman strength several times more than Spider-Man's, on par with the Thing's.

In a story with the Wizard, the Wizard fashioned Sandman a suit with a belt that contained chemicals to mix into the Sandman to enable him to change himself into consistencies related to sand. The suit's composition, as Sandman's usual "clothes," changed with him.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Eventually Sandman stopped using the suit.

Temperature does alter the Sandman. At 3,400 Fahrenheit his body turns into glass, also a form he can control. Unlike Sandman's fast transformation from sand to glass, his transformation from glass to sand takes time.<ref>[[Erik Larsen|Larsen, Erik]]; ''Spider-Man Vol..1'' #18-23; January 1992-June 1992</ref> 

Although he is invulnerable to most physical attacks, even projectiles because they pass through him, water is a different story to him. So, too, is a rare physical attack. In combat against [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], the villain's powerful mouth ripped cleanly and swiftly into Sandman. The amount of sand removed abruptly, and perhaps because of Venom's poisons, left the [[mass]] of Sandman in contortion, crippled beyond immediate repair. Sandman began to disintegrate, then flowed down a drain, giving the impression he had met his end.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Later he is washed up onto and into a beach.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

As of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #615, it seems Sandman will be able to split into multiple persons, at a time.

==Other versions==
===1602===
''[[Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four]]'', a sequel to [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' written by [[Peter David]], features the 1602 version of the Marvel Sandman. While he physically resembles Flint Marko, he has the pale skin and glowing eyes of Gaiman's [[Dream (DC Comics)|Morpheus]]. He also alludes to an ability to summon nightmares. In the fourth issue he is able to send Ben Grimm to sleep by blowing a vapor or dust at him. Both the Sandman and Trapster are crushed by falling debris when Bensaylum collapses.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===House of M: Masters of Evil===
Sandman appears as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1</ref> He was killed by both Rogue and Marrow during the riot at Santo Rico.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #4</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies|Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'', the Sandman, having become a [[zombie]], appears to attack [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] alongside several other Spider-Man villains during an attempt to evacuate innocent civilians into a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]]. The six villains are repelled.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days''</ref>  It is later revealed in ''Marvel Zombies Return'' #1 that this Sandman was infected by his reality's Spider-Man.

===Marvel Zombies Return===
A version of Sandman similar to a past version of 616 counterpart appears as part of a version of the [[Sinister Six]].  After Zombie Spider-Man teleports into this reality, the Kingpin sends the six to fight "Spider-Man".  The other five members are violently killed by the zombie Spider-Man and Sandman flees, later encountering and killing his own reality's Spider-Man out of fear by pouring himself into his mouth until his stomach bursts.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===Spider-Man: Reign===
In ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' Sandman is a part of an elderly [[Sinister Six]], but when his daughter is killed he abandons the Six, and helps Spider-Man defeat them and Venom.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===Spider-Ham===
In ''[[Spider-Ham|Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham]]'' #12 Sandman appears as a manatee called '''Sandmanatee'''.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

===Ultimate Sandman===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[fictional universe|Universe]], Flint Marko is a genetic mutation by industrialist [[Justin Hammer]] who attempts to recreate the Super Soldier Serum. Shortly after [[Doctor Octopus]] kills Hammer, S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltrates Hammer's factory to obtain experiments Hammer had been working on. Marko uses this opportunity to escape and wreak havoc in [[New Jersey]]. S.H.I.E.L.D., with the help of Spider-Man, contains him and imprisons him in a S.H.I.E.L.D holding facility. There, he meets fellow genetically altered criminals Norman Osborn ([[Alternate versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate_Marvel|Green Goblin]]), Dr. Otto Octavius ([[Doctor Octopus #Ultimate Doctor Octopus|Doctor Octopus]]), Max Dillon ([[Electro (comics) #Ultimate Electro|Electro]]) and [[Kraven the Hunter #Ultimate Kraven|Kraven the Hunter]]. Under the Green Goblin's and Dr. Octopus's leadership, they break free and capture Spider-Man to form the [[Ultimate Six]]. Marko participates with the group in an attack on the [[White House]]. However, [[Iron Man]] stops them. After the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. seals Marko in various jars and keeps them frozen.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

Artist [[Mark Bagley]], who drew the first 100+ issues of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', noted in his rough designs for Ultimate Sandman that he would appear "[[nudity|Nekkid]]" most of the time. As he wanted to go with the more 'realistic' feel of the Ultimate imprint, he doubted whether Flint Marko's clothing had unstable [[molecule]]s like his body.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Reception==
In 2009, Sandman was named [[IGN]]'s 72nd Greatest comic book villain of all time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/72.html Sandman is number 72] [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.</ref>
==In other media==

===''Spider-Man: The Animated Series''===
Sandman did not appear in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' because the series did not want to interfere with the continuity of [[James Cameron]]'s proposed ''Spider-Man'' movie, in which the Sandman and Electro were supposed to be the villains. Although Electro was belatedly introduced into the series when Cameron's film fell through, Sandman remained unseen in the series, the only major Spider-Man villain not to appear in the show (although [[Hydro-Man]] fulfilled many similar roles, and it has been stated that he was indeed essentially used as a replacement for Sandman<ref>[http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/interviews/krieg/ Marvel Animation Age Presents: Spider-Man]</ref>). Also because of Cameron's film, Sandman did not appear in the [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|''Fantastic Four'' cartoon in the 1990s]], most notably the episodes featuring the Frightful Four.

===''The Spectacular Spider-Man''===
[[Image:Competition Spectacular Spider-Man.jpg|175px|thumb|Sandman in [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]].]]
Sandman appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. First appearing in "Survivlal of the Fittest," Marko is a petty crook working for [[Tombstone (comics)|Big Man]] and consistently is caught with his cohort [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] by Spider-Man. In the fifth episode, "Competition," Big Man uses Marko as a guinea pig in [[Oscorp]]'s underground experiments meant to give Marko a super silicon armor, but the experiment goes awry and transforms him into the Sandman.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0802/02/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, February 2, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Soon afterward Flint is offered revenge against Spider-Man. He refuses, saying he wants only a "big score." He severs his alliance with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and becomes an independent criminal, the Sandman. Spider-Man attacks him when he robs a bank, but he defeats the hero and escapes into a drain whose grill, however, obstructs him from taking his loot, forcing him to leave it behind. Spider-Man captures him in their next fight despite that Sandman appears to have the upper hand, when a large slab of cement drops on Sandman without room for him to slip out from underneath it.
He reappears in "Group Therapy" where he alongside [[Doctor Octopus]], Rhino, [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] are busted out of jail by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and form the [[Sinister Six]]. Sandman rekindles his partnership with Alex O'Hirn, Rhino.

===Film===
[[Image:S3 sandman punch.jpg|right|175px|thumb|[[Spider-Man]] punches Sandman in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007).]]
[[Thomas Haden Church]] played Sandman in the 2007 feature film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In the film, Sandman's origins are similar to the comics except for his connection to Spider-Man's origin. Flint Marko steals to pay for medical treatment for his [[critical illness|critically ill]] daughter, Penny. While on the run from the police after escaping from prison, he accidentally falls into an experimental [[particle accelerator]] that molecularly binds him with sand, giving him [[shapeshifting]] sand abilities. A major focus of the plot involves Marko's connection to the murder of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] ([[Cliff Robertson]]), Spider-Man's uncle, in [[Spider-Man (film)|the first film]]. Sandman is later spotted by police officers walking down the streets of [[Manhattan]]. Sandman gets on top of a dump truck filled with huge amounts of sand. 
At the police station, police captain [[Spider-Man supporting characters#Gwen Stacy's family|George Stacy]] ([[James Cromwell]]) discovers evidence Marko is [[Ben Parker]]'s killer. He tells Peter and [[Aunt May]] ([[Rosemary Harris]]) the carjacker, [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]], whom Peter confronted two years earlier, is Marko's accomplice. A vengeful Spider-Man, wearing the black suit that would eventually become Venom, attacked and seemingly killed Marko but he survived and later joined forces with Venom to eliminate Spider-Man. He is ultimately defeated by [[Harry Osborn]], and upon learning Spiderman's true identity after witnessing the destruction of Venom, he talks with Peter at the conclusion of the film, revealing he didn't mean to kill Uncle Ben. Flint stated that he just wanted the car from Ben, and as Ben peacefully attempts to talk Flint out of it, Carradine come by, startling Flint, and causing his gun to discharge, killing Ben. This shocks Flint, who remained inert while Carradine drives away in Ben's car before getting in a run with the police. Flint stated this because he wanted Peter to understand and that his love for his daughter Penny is the only thing he has left for himself. Understanding the importance of forgiveness over revenge, Peter forgives him, and Flint, having accepted Peter's forgiveness, peacefully shapeshifts away to his daughter.
