{{spoiler}}

The '''Sandman''' (William Baker, alias Flint Marko) is a [[comic book]] [[supervillian]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 ([[1963]]).

The Sandman has the ability to transform into a malleable [[sand|sand-like]] substance which can be hardened, dispersed, or shaped according to his will.  He possesses vast superhuman strength several times in excess of Spider-Man's, making him an equal to [[Thing_(comics)|The Thing]] (85-Ton Level).  This ability came from an incident of accidental [[radiation]] bombardment on an atomic bomb testing beach, the result of which was that Marko's molecules merged with that of the sand under him.

In addition to his many crime sprees, Sandman has served as a founding member of the [[Frightful Four]] which often tangled with the [[Fantastic Four]], and of the [[Sinister Six]] which frequently battled [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].

At one point, after a humiliating experience of temporarily becoming a monster after he merged with [[Hydro-Man]], he reformed, thanks in part to the support of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and became a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and later a [[mercenary]] in the employ of [[Silver Sable]].  He later reverted to his villainous ways, claiming to have been faking his heroic career, although it was revealed that the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] had used his mind-controlling "Id Machine" to force him to act as a villain. 

Later, Sandman joined an incarnation of the Sinister Six, working with [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. It was in this incarnation that Venom bit the Sandman, poisoning him, making his body crumble. He blamed Spider-Man in the beginning but he then asked him to deliver a message to his mother. The Sandman crumbled to pieces and seemingly died, dispersing down a sewer drain. 

However, Marko was in actuality not dead.  His sandy remains eventually became spread out over Jones Beach, New York, with his mind and personality scattered.  The beach Sandman had now merged with and taken control over began to mindlessly swallow up people into the sand, in an unconscious attempt to slowly piece himself back together.  Spider-Man tried to free the captured people from the Sandman's consciousness, only succeeding when Marko exploded from containing too many clashing mindsets.  Relatively soon afterward, the sand that Sandman's body was composed of spread to different areas around New York, and all of the different aspects and personalities of Sandman's shattered mind formed into their own individual beings - Marko's good side, evil side, feminine side and childlike, infant side were all separated to different parts of the city.  After they were all finally merged back together into one again, the standard evil side of his personality once again became the dominant one, and the criminal named the Sandman is once again at large.

==Ultimate Sandman==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Flint Marco is a genetic mutation of the industrialist [[Justin Hammer]]. Marco was one of the results of genetic experiments trying to recreate the Super Soldier Formula. Shortly after Hammer was killed by Dr. Octopus, SHIELD infiltrated Hammer's factory to take care of any experiments Hammer was working on. Marco used this opportunity to escape and wreak havoc upon New York. SHIELD with the help of [[Spiderman]] managed to contain him, he was later imprisoned in the [[Triskelion]], where he meets fellow genetic fugitives; Norman Osborn ([[Green Goblin]]), Dr. Otto Octavius, ([[Doctor Octopus]]), Max Dillon ([[Electro]]), and [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Under the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus's leadership, the 5 broke free and captured Spiderman to form the [[Ultimate Six]]. Marco participated with the group with an Attack on the White House, however he was defeated by [[Iron Man]]. After the battle, Marco was sealed in various vials of Sand.

==Television==

Sandman appeared in one episode of ''[[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends]]'', where he was voiced by [[Chris Latta]]. Other than this, the Sandman has no other animated appearances, in a [[Spider-Man]] [[cartoon]] or otherwise.
