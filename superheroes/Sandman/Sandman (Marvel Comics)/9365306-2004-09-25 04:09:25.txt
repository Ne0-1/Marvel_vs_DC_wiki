'''The Sandman''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 ([[1963]]).

The Sandman has the ability to transform into a malleable [[sand]]-like substance which can be hardened, dispersed, or shaped according to his will.  He possesses vast superhuman strength several times in excess of Spider-Man's.  This ability was the result of accidental [[radiation]] bombardment.

He served as a founding member of the [[Frightful Four]] which often tangled with the [[Fantastic Four]], and of the [[Sinister Six]] which frequently battled Spider-Man.

At one point, after a humiliating experience of temporarily becoming a monster after he merged with [[Hydro-Man]], he reformed, thanks in part to the support of [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]], and became a member of [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and later a [[mercenary]] in the employ of [[Silver Sable]].  He later reverted to his villainous ways, claiming to have been faking his heroic career, although it was revealed that the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] had used his mind-controlling "Id Machine" to return the Sandman to his villainous ways.
