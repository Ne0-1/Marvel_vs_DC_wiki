'''Sandman''' (a.k.a. '''Flint Marko'''; born '''William Baker''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]],   traditionally an adversary of [[Spider-Man]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 (Sept. 1963). His body has been changed into sand, which he can control completely. He may also absorb nearby sand and reconstitute it into his body. He was portrayed by [[Thomas Hayden Church]] in the [[2007 in film|2007]] film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
William Baker was born in [[Queens, New York]].  At the age of three, young Billy was abandoned by his uncaring father and forced to live in poverty with his mother, who worked as a cleaning lady for a meager salary, and as a result, succumbed to [[alcoholism]].  Because she could not provide luxuries for young Billy, she sometimes took him to [[Coney Island]] beach, where Billy relished creating sand sculptures.  He also enjoyed sculpting and working with sand in school, where he was encouraged by his teacher, Miss Flint, on whom he had a crush.  

Billy was bullied by a boy named Vic and his two other friends at school, until he learned how to fight, inspired by his observations of the sand and water at the beach, to use a technique in which he used his opponents’ motion against them, “slipping through their fingers like sand”. After this, Vic and the other two bullies now became Billy’s friends all the way through high school, during which Billy channeled his anger through football, and adopted the nickname “Flint”, both because it sounded imposing and because it reminded him of Miss Flint.  He also turned to theft and cheating to get through class and make ends meet at home.  

After Vic incurred a large debt to the mob, he begged Flint to throw a football game in order to pay off the debt.  After doing so, Flint’s coach threw him off the team, telling him that he had thought Flint would “make a mark” on the world, but that he now saw that Flint would never accomplish anything. Flint beat up the coach, and was expelled from school, after which he turned to a life of crime, and soon found work as a mob enforcer. He became involved in more and more illegal activity, and slowly developed a violent and bitter personality. Eventually he ended up imprisoned on [[Ryker's Island]] for his crimes, where he met his father, Floyd Baker. He befriended his father, but didn’t reveal who he was, giving only his nickname, Flint, and a false surname, Marko, which was inspired by his former coach’s taunts about “making a mark” on the world, and which would become his regular alias.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1">[[Peter David|David, Peter]]; ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual'' #1; July 2007</ref>  (He also changed his name to prevent his mother from discovering that her son was a criminal.<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]; ''Marvel Two-In-One #86''; April 1982</ref>)  Marko spent years in and out of jail, which was made bearable only by the presence of his father.  After Floyd was released from prison, Marko decided to escape.<ref name="FriendlyAnnual1"/>

Immediately, he fled to a nuclear testing site on a beach near [[Savannah, Georgia]] where he came into contact with sand that had been irradiated by an experimental reactor. His body and the radioactive sand bonded, and Marko's molecular structure was altered into a sand/dirt-like substance that could transform any or all of his body into sand. Impressed, he adopted the name Sandman to match his new powers. 

Marko clashed with [[Spider-Man]] for the first time at the high school which the hero attended as Peter Parker. Marko was defeated by Spider-Man (who used a vacuum cleaner), but eventually resurfaced as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] led by [[Doctor Octopus]]. After being soundly defeated by Spider-Man several more times, Baker gave up and took a shot at battling other superheroes. Most notably, he joined the original [[Frightful Four]] to combat the [[Fantastic Four]], but this fledgling group of villains were beaten by the experienced heroes. He also fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. During his encounters with the Hulk, Sandman wore a diamond-patterned green costume with a purple headpiece. This has not been seen again.

Sandman eventually discovers that &mdash; starting with his hand &mdash; his body is slowly transforming into [[glass]], although he is able to reverse the effect. Afterwards, he decides to resume his struggle with his original adversary, Spider-Man, and allies himself with [[Hydro-Man]] to do battle with their mutual enemy. A freak accident briefly merges the two into an unintelligent and largely ineffective mud monster, but Spider-Man and the police managed to dehydrate it. Many months later, Sandman finally manages to disconnect from Hydro-Man. Afterwards, Baker becomes deeply depressed, and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] of the Fantastic Four supports him, and encourages him to use his power in the name of good. Sandman then makes sporadic appearances in various Spider-Man comics, assisting his former enemy.  The first such appearance has him coming to the rescue of Spider-Man and [[Silver Sable]], who are outnumbered and surrounded by the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. Silver Sable is impressed by Sandman's performance and recruits him as a freelance operative. Sandman also appears as part of the [[Outlaws (comics)|Outlaws]], a group of reformed Spider-Man enemies such as [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]], [[Rocket Racer]], [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], and [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]], who would turn up from time to time to help Spider-Man.  

Baker briefly joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a reserve member. Later, he becomes a full-time [[mercenary]] in the employ of [[Silver Sable]], as a member of her [[Wild Pack]], serving alongside heroes such as [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]]. Sandman is one of the few heroes temporarily overwhelmed by their evil doubles during the [[Infinity War]]. This double almost kills the entire Pack.
  
Marko, without alien influence, eventually reverts to his villainous ways, claiming to have faked his heroic career, although it is  revealed that the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] used his mind-controlling "Id Machine" to force him to act as a villain. 

Sandman then rejoins a new incarnation of the Sinister Six, which is working with one of Spider-Man's deadliest enemies, [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. Venom reveals that he had joined the team to make sure no one else kills Spider-Man, and turns on the remaining five. Dealing with Baker, Venom rips off and swallows a chunk of sand, which apparently destabilizes Sandman's body structure. His body slowly begins to crumble away. He blames Spider-Man, but ultimately asks him to deliver a message to his mother. He also expresses remorse that he could not pull off the task of becoming an official superhero. The Sandman then crumbles to pieces and seems to die, washing away down a sewer and ending up as part of Jones Beach, New York. 

Sandman's body and mind scatter with the grains of sand. The major part of his mind merges with the beach and begins swallowing people in an attempt to piece himself back together. Spider-Man tries to free the captured people from Sandman's beach consciousness, which is his evil mindset, and succeeds when Baker explodes from too many clashing mindsets. Soon the sand of the beach begins to spread to different areas around New York, and all of the different aspects of Sandman's shattered mind form individual beings: Baker's good side, evil side, feminine side and childlike side. Spider-Man locates all of the different versions of Sandman and attempts to convince them to return to one being. Sandman's evil side merges with his child and feminine sides, but Sandman's good side doesn't want to allow evil to become a part of him again. The new Sandman responds by abandoning his good side completely, which eventually crumbles into lifeless sand and blows away. While the new Sandman is not the sadistic monstrosity that his purely evil side was, he is a criminal and seems to lack any desire to become a hero or do good.

Sandman is one of the villains recruited to recover the [[Identity Disc]], but is seemingly killed due to mutinous behavior. At the series' end, Sandman is revealed to be alive and working along with the Vulture to manipulate the other villains.

According to ''[[Spider-Man: Chapter One]]'' by [[John Byrne]], Baker is related to the [[Green Goblin|Osborn family]]. This has not been referred to by other writers, mostly because the series' critical failure rendered it non-canon.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

In the storyline "Sandblasted", which ran in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #17-19 (April-June 2007), Sandman asked Spider-Man for help in clearing the name of his father, who has been imprisoned for murdering a homeless man. Baker admitted that his father was a petty criminal, but insisted he would never kill anyone. Baker also mentioned that the victim bears an uncanny resemblance to a picture of Peter Parker's [[Uncle Ben]]. Sandman and Spider-Man found the true killer, who turned out to be [[Chameleon (comics)#Chameleon 2211|Chameleon 2211]]. Chameleon 2211 killed the Uncle Ben that [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211| Hobgoblin 2211]] brought from an alternate universe (in ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #8) and was posing as him after that. Thanks to Spider-Man, Floyd Baker was switched with Chameleon 2211 and saved, for which Sandman was grateful to Spider-Man.

==Powers and abilities==
The Sandman has the ability to transform into a malleable sand-like substance which can be hardened, dispersed, or shaped according to his will, something akin to a type of geokinesis limited to sand and small rock particles. Even if his body is blown apart, he is capable of reforming it. His striped shirt and cargo pants are both a part of his mass sand-like body. They are colored to appear as if he were wearing actual clothes. 

Most of the time, he is mainly seen transforming his arms and hands into a sand [[Mace (club)|mace]] or a [[sledgehammer]] to battle Spider-Man and his other enemies. He can merge with natural sand if it is in his direct vicinity like a beach or desert, thus he can manipulate normal sand like his normal body, add it to his physical size and strength, or use it to reform himself. Sandman has mental and physical control over every particle of sand in his body. 
His body seems to take the physical and chemical qualities of sand, as once he was mixed with cement ingredients and was turned into solid cement. Despite this weakness to cement, he remained alive like this but in a [[coma]]-like state, and returned to normal later. He possesses superhuman strength several times in excess of Spider-Man's, making him roughly equal to the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

He once wore a uniform devised by the Wizard, which enabled him to mix chemicals into his body for various effects, but he has long since discontinued its use. This uniform, like his usual clothing, turned to sand and back when he did. If exposed to extreme heat, Sandman will turn to glass, but if shattered, he can control his glass shard form and reform himself. This, however, takes time to complete.<ref>[[Erik Larsen|Larsen, Erik]]; ''Spider-Man Vol.1'' #18-23; January 1992-June 1992</ref> He is invulnerable to most physical attacks and projectiles from most firearms simply fly right through him, but he is vulnerable to large amounts of water and ice. He once disintegrated when the supervillain [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] bit off a piece of him, separating it from the main part of his mass and thus causing him to lose control over the rest of his body. After a prolonged period of disintegration, he appeared to die, but washed up on a beach, where he reformed himself using the sand he found there.

==Other versions==
===1602===
''[[Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four]]'', a sequel to [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' written by [[Peter David]], features the [[1602]] version of the Marvel Sandman. While he physically resembles Flint Marko, he has the pale skin and glowing eyes of Gaiman's [[Dream (DC Comics)|Morpheus]]. He also alludes to an ability to summon nightmares. In the fourth issue he is able to send Ben Grimm to sleep by blowing a vapor or dust at him. He has not yet shown any signs of his traditional powers.

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies|Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'', the Sandman, having become a zombie, appears to attack [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] alongside several other Spider-Man villains during an attempt to evacuate innocent civilians into a SHIELD Helicarrier.

===Spider-Man: Reign===
In ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' Sandman is a part of an elderly [[Sinister Six]], but when his daughter is killed he abandons the Six, and helps Spider-Man defeat them and Venom.

===Spider-Ham===
In ''[[Spider-Ham|Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham]]'' #12 Sandman appears as a manatee called '''Sandmanatee'''.

===Ultimate Sandman===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Flint Marko (which is his birthname) is a genetic mutation of the industrialist [[Justin Hammer]], one of the results of an attempt to recreate the super soldier formula. Shortly after Hammer was killed by Dr. Octopus, S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltrated Hammer's factory to take care of any experiments Hammer was working on. Marko used this opportunity to escape and wreak havoc upon New Jersey. S.H.I.E.L.D., with the help of [[Spider-Man]], managed to contain him and imprisoned him in a S.H.I.E.L.D holding facility. There, he met fellow genetic fugitives Norman Osborn ([[Green Goblin #Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]]), Dr. Otto Octavius ([[Doctor Octopus #Ultimate Doctor Octopus|Doctor Octopus]]), Max Dillon ([[Electro (comics) #Ultimate Electro|Electro]]), and [[Kraven the Hunter #Ultimate Kraven|Kraven the Hunter]]. Under the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus's leadership, the five broke free and captured Spider-Man to form the [[Ultimate Six]]. Marko participated with the group in an attack on the [[White House]]. However, he was defeated by [[Iron Man]]. After the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. sealed Marko in various jars and kept them frozen.

In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, it is shown that [[Abner Jenkins|Ultimate Beetle]] stole one of the vials containing Flint Marko. The ramifications have yet to be seen.

Artist [[Mark Bagley]], who drew the first 100+ issues of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', noted in his rough designs for Ultimate Sandman that he would appear "[[nudity|Nekkid]]" most of the time. As he wanted to go with the more 'realistic' feel of the Ultimate imprint, he doubted whether Flint Marko's clothing had unstable [[molecules]] like his body (a similar problem appeared in Spider-Man 3, where the genetic accelerator turned Marko's clothing into sand along with his body, but the locket containing a picture of his daughter stayed the same).{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

In the same issue featuring Marko's debut, it revealed Marko was a small time thug who landed in Ryker's Prison after a failed car robbery, beating up his girlfried, and murduring a cop by beating him severely.

==In other media==
===Television===
*Sandman appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "The Sands of Crime".
*Sandman appeared in the 1970s ''[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "The Frightful Four" as part of the titular [[Frightful Four]].
*Sandman also appeared in the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon in "The Sandman is Coming".
*He later appeared in a similar episode of ''[[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends]]'', "Spider-Man: Unmasked!", where he was voiced by [[Chris Latta]].
*Sandman did not appear in the ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|Spider-Man]]'' animated series of the 1990s because the series did not want to interfere with the continuity of [[James Cameron]]'s proposed ''Spider-Man'' movie, in which the Sandman and Electro were supposed to be the villains. Although Electro was belatedly introduced into the series when Cameron's film fell through, Sandman remained unseen in the series, the only major Spidey villain not to appear in the show (although [[Hydro-Man]] fulfilled many similar roles, and it has been stated that he was indeed essentially used as a replacement for Sandman<ref>[http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/interviews/krieg/ Marvel Animation Age Presents: Spider-Man]</ref>).
*Also because of Cameron's film, Sandman did not appear in the [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four cartoon in the 1990s]], most notably the episodes featuring the Frightful Four. Instead, he was replaced with [[Hydro-Man]], a character who has similar powers to Sandman, only with water instead of sand, and had already been featured in the Spider-Man cartoon.
*Sandman will be in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', having already appeared in a promotional poster (albeit only visible as an arm reaching for Spider-Man). He will appear in at least one episode in his civilian identity before becoming Sandman. {{Fact|date=August 2007}}

===Film===
[[Thomas Haden Church]] played Sandman in the 2007 feature film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In the film, Sandman's origins are similar to the comics except for his connection to Spider-Man's origin. Flint Marko steals to pay for medical treatment for his daughter Penny, who has an unspecified illness. While on the run from the police after escaping from prison, he accidentally falls into an experimental [[particle accelerator]] that molecularly binds him with sand, giving him [[shapeshifting]] sand abilities. A major focus of the plot of the film involves Marko's connection to the murder of Peter's Uncle Ben ([[Cliff Robertson]]) in the first film.

Sandman is later spotted by police officers walking down the streets of Manhattan. Sandman gets on top of a dump truck filled with huge amounts of sand. When one of the policemen climbs atop the truck, he is assaulted by a huge fist made out of sand. Having absorbed the truck's sand to add to his mass, a giant Sandman then emerges. The police shoot at Marko, but he manages to escape by turning into a sandstorm and flying away with the wind. At the Spider-Man fair, the sandstorm is spotted, and Spider-Man is asked to investigate. In doing so, Spider-Man confronts Sandman, foiling his attempt to rob an armored truck, but Sandman gets away. 

Later, at the police station, it is revealed by Police Captain [[Spider-Man supporting characters#Gwen Stacy's family|George Stacy]] ([[James Cromwell]]) that there is evidence implicating Marko as [[Ben Parker]]'s  killer, and he also tells Peter and [[Aunt May]] ([[Rosemary Harris]]) that the carjacker, [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]], that Peter confronted two years earlier was really Marko's accomplice, and did not fire the shot that killed Ben Parker. In the meantime, Sandman robs a bank, and Spider-Man, now with enhanced abilities due to his [[Symbiote (comics)|new black suit]], chases him to the subways. During their fight, Spider-Man manages to burst a water tank, flooding Sandman in water and turning him into mud, which is swept through a sewer grate. Believing that Sandman is dead, Spider-Man leaves in satisfaction; but unbeknownst to him, Sandman, who is washed out to the river, is able to eventually reconstitute himself.

Later, Spider-Man tears the symbiote off his body in a bell tower after learning of its [[Parasitism|parasitic]] nature, and it merges with Eddie Brock, Jr. ([[Topher Grace]]) to become [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]], who convinces Sandman to team up with him to destroy Spider-Man. Sandman agrees because he feels that Spider-Man will not stop chasing him until he is dead. The two kidnap [[Mary Jane Watson]] ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) and take her to a construction site, forcing Spider-Man to face them both. During the fight, Sandman uses the site's sand to again increase his size, turning into a version of himself several stories high. After Venom restrains Spider-Man with his webbing, almost strangling him, Sandman nearly beats Spider-Man to death, but for the intervention of [[Harry Osborn]] ([[James Franco]]), under the guise of the [[Green Goblin|New Goblin]], who comes to his friend's aid with his Goblin arsenal. Harry explodes a pumpkin bomb at Sandman, and then distracts Venom enough to free Spider-Man. Working together, the two manage to save Mary Jane and defeat Sandman and Venom, though at the cost of Harry's and Eddie's lives.  Sandman returns to his normal size, and having discovered Spider-Man's real identity, he reveals that his shooting of Ben Parker was an accident while he was trying to carjack Uncle Ben. During the incident, Ben attempted to reason with Marko, but Carradine arrived and startled Flint, causing him to shoot Ben accidentally. Realizing that Marko is telling the truth, and understanding the importance of forgiveness over revenge, Spider-Man forgives him, and Marko shapeshifts and flies away.
