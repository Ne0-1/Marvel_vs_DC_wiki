'''The Cadre''' is a [[DC Comics]] supervillain group, except for members of the Cadre of the Immortal, most of whom were redeemed and became heroes by story's end. They first appear in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #235 February (1985), and were created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Chuck Patton]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Cadre | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 64  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional history==
A cosmic alien villain known as the [[Overmaster]] began to test humanity's fitness to inhabit Earth. He had summoned a bunch of villains to him and gave them superpowers, and the villains became the Cadre. The Cadre has fought the [[Justice League]] on different occasions and has been through many incarnations of their group. Several members have died and new ones were recruited.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

There was also another version of the Cadre called the Cadre of the Immortal; this version was made up of international [[metahuman]]s deluded by an agent of the Overmaster that claimed to be [[Prester John]], the Immortal. The Mahayogi was killed while freeing JLI member [[Maya (comics)|Maya]] from mind control. After the truth was revealed Seneca and Osiris joined the JLI in their battle against the Overmaster, but have not been seen in the DCU since.

Another version of the Cadre was formed with various members of minor DC villain groups such as [[Extremists (comics)|The Extremists]].<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Extremists, The | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 117  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>
