'''Henry Peter Gyrich''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]], who was named after a relative of Marvel Comics one time editor-in-chief, Jim Shooter. The fictional character Gyrich is most notable for his work in the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. He first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 1 #165 (November 1977) and was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[George Perez]].

==Fictional character biography==

Henry Peter Gyrich was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. When he first appeared, he was the first person to be given the title of US Government Liaison to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by the [[National Security Agency]]. With his status, Gyrich was one of only two humans (the second being the [[President of the United States]]) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure with the Avengers, Gyrich revoked their priority status after noting several (in his mind) problems with the team. The Avengers had to accept Gyrich’s “suggestions” or not be able to use their Quinjets and other sensitive equipment again. He limited the Avengers’ active membership to seven members, forced the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to join against his will to fill a quota and installed various security measures for the team.

Gyrich oversaw the Avengers’ activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbade them to go on a mission to help [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. The next incident involved a security leak. Gyrich took part in a [[United States Senate|Senate]] investigation involving the Avengers which claimed they were threats to [[national security]]. When the investigation was over, the Senate committee gave the Avengers new guidelines to follow; they also named Raymond Sikorski as his successor.

Writer [[Peter David]] has indicated that Shooter based Gyrich on himself.  Although Gyrich is an ''Avengers'' character, David attempted to humanize him by giving him some backstory in ''Incredible Hulk'' #456 (August 1997), which touched upon Gyrich’s family life. After [[Betty Banner]] criticizes Gyrich for appearing callous and unfeeling when she mentions the pain of her father dying in her arms, Gyrich cuts her off, saying, “My father died of [[Alzheimer's|Alzheimer’s]], lady. I took a year’s leave to care for him so he wouldn’t be watched over by strangers that my crummy salary couldn’t even afford. I cleaned up after him, tended to him, and his last words as I cradled his dying body were, ‘Who in heck are you?’&nbsp;”<ref>[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/005313.html “Q&A” entry on David’s blog; April 14, 2007 (The information on this point is in the April 16, 2005, 9:31 a.m. post.)]</ref> As a result, it is revealed in [[Avengers: The Initiative]] that Gyrich’s greatest fear is contracting the same disease that killed his father.

===Commission on Superhuman Activities===

Gyrich became a member of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, the oversight body on [[posthuman|superhuman]] activities in the United States; there he was part of the team that forced [[Captain America]] to resign. Gyrich also took part in [[Project Wideawake]] as a special consultant. This project was a covert government commission designed to deal with the problems concerning [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutants]] in the [[United States|America]]. The project was instrumental in creating a team of mutants to counter the threat of foreign mutants. This team was called [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

Gyrich later became involved in the United States’ war efforts against the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s. This time, he worked alongside [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], a mutant who worked as a weapons maker for the U.S. government & [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Gyrich took a specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun of Forge’s to capture the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] because she had broken into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. In an encounter with Rogue, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shot Storm. This specialized weapon stripped Storm of her powers and abilities as a mutant, although she regained them some time later. Gyrich continued attempting to use Forge’s own version of the [[Rom the Spaceknight|Spaceknight Rom]]’s [[Spaceknight Rom's Neutralizer|Neutralizer]], planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. He was stopped in the attempt by Rom and Forge, and could only watch, tied up, as Rom banished Wraithworld instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich was also involved in hunting the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after the events of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

===Operation: Zero Tolerance===

Gyrich became a key player in [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]’s Operation: Zero Tolerance. He was a faithful believer in the operation until he himself became a target of [[Prime Sentinels]]. After being rescued by [[Spider-Man]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], Gyrich demanded the operation be shut down.

===Destroy Earth’s superhumans===

He was promoted to succeed [[Val Cooper|Valerie Cooper]] as the head of the Commission on Superhuman Activities. While there, [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker]] secretly placed Gyrich under the control of [[Nanorobotics|nanites]]. Gyrich used Commission resources and remolded the vigilante [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]] into the assassin [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] and attempted to live out his “fantasy” of killing all the world’s superhumans, before being stopped by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

===Return to the Avengers===

Following that incident, he was reassigned to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and was made the liaison for [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] as well as the Avengers’ new liaison (this time, by [[Captain America]]’s suggestion) to the [[United Nations]]. During this time, he redeemed himself in the eyes of the team when he refused to deliver information on the Avengers to the [[Secretary of State]], Dell Rusk (secretly the [[Red Skull]]). He never broke, even under severe duress, which impressed the others. Gyrich was a faithful liaison officer to the Avengers. Gyrich’s job came to an end after the United Nations ended their relationship with the Avengers<ref>“[[Avengers Disassembled]]”</ref>.

===The Initiative===

Gyrich is the Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref>; his base of operations appears to be [[Camp Hammond]], the superhuman training facility in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. It is under his orders that the Gauntlet is drafted as the camp’s [[Drill Instructor]], gives orders to cover up the death of [[MVP (comics)|MVP]]. He makes arrangements to provide a special tutor to [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]] through his old friend [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]]<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2</ref>.  The tutor is revealed to be depowered mutant [[Dani Moonstar]]<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref>. They do not get along well and Gyrich fires her for training Truama to use his powers to help people with debilitating phobias instead of to be used as a weapon.

==Alternate versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===

In the “[[Age of Apocalypse]]” alternate timeline storyline, Gyrich is an anti-mutant suicide bomber that threatens to destroy Heaven, Angel’s club. He is defeated by the Bedlam Brothers.

===Mutant X===

In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic, Gyrich is the government’s liaison to the Avengers. He called for the aid of the Six to search for Dracula.

===Ultimate Marvel===

In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comic, Gyrich works for the CIA. He is trying to establish a check and balance system for [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]]’s super police force.

It later appears as though Gyrich hired [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]’s father,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #100</ref> after he survives an assassination attempt by [[Bolivar Trask]], to continue and develop the Venom project in order to have the firepower to oppose Nick Fury and his super soldiers. However, it is revealed that the Richard Parker who seems to have revealed himself to be still alive was, in fact, a clone of Peter Parker whose aging was accelerated and his memories implanted.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103</ref> It is unknown how much of the experience he had dealing with Gyrich was something he actually experienced or was made to believe he remembered. Gyrich, however, is indeed a real person, as during a battle between the [[Doctor Octopus|Ultimate Doctor Octopus]] and Spider-Man, Nick Fury distracts Gyrich by asking him confusing questions and confronting him about the supposedly illegal Super-Soldier program that had been going on behind Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.’s back <ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #105</ref>.

==In other media==
===Television===

[[Image:Night Of The Sentinels, Part Two- Gyrich.jpg|thumb|right|Henry Peter Gyrich in  the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated series]].]]

*Gyrich appeared in the first episode of the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated series]], “[[Night of the Sentinels (Part 1)]]” and “[[Night of the Sentinels (Part 2)]],” and was voiced by [[Barry Flatman]]. He also appeared in the season one finale “The Final Decision,” the season four episode “Courage” and the series finale “Graduation Day.” Gyrich’s personality in the series was an extreme take on that of his appearances in the ''Avengers'' and ''X-Men'' comic books as he supported mutant oppression and possibly even extinction, whereas in the comics he was merely distrustful of superhumans in general. In the series finale, he quickly revealed that Professor Charles Xavier was a mutant by calling on a force wave with a remote control, which revealed his power of telepathy at a worldwide conference. This weakened Xavier and almost killed him by the end of the episode, although he was taken to the [[Shi'ar|Shi’ar]] homeworld by [[Lilandra]] to recuperate. This attack also nearly wounded many other people at the conference. Gyrich was taken away to custody because of his insanity, but warned everyone not to trust anyone because they might well be a mutant.
*Henry Peter Gyrich appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (2006 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode “Imperious Rex” voiced by [[Don Brown]].

===Films===

*Gyrich made a brief cameo in the ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' movie (played by [[Matthew Sharp]]) as an aide to [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]], although it was quickly revealed that “he” was actually [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who had murdered the real Gyrich and taken his place. At the end of the movie, a television news report can be heard saying that Gyrich’s body was found, apparently mauled by a bear (in reality Sabretooth).
