'''Henry Peter Gyrich''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 1 #165 (November 1977) and was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[George Pérez]].

==Fictional character biography==
Henry Gyrich is the first person to be given the title of U.S. Government [[Liaison officer|Liaison]] to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by the [[National Security Agency]] later by the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. With his status, Gyrich is one of only two people (the other being the [[President of the United States]]) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure, Gyrich revokes the Avengers' priority status after taking issue.{{issue|date=July 2013}} The Avengers have to accept Gyrich's "suggestions" or have their Quinjets and other sensitive equipment taken away.{{issue|date=July 2013}} He limits the Avengers’ active membership to seven members, forces the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to join unwillingly to fill an [[affirmative action]] quota he sets and installs various security measures for the team.{{issue|date=July 2013}} Gyrich oversees the Avengers' activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbids them to go on a mission to help [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]].{{issue|date=July 2013}} The next incident involves a security leak. Gyrich takes part in a [[United States Senate|Senate]] investigation involving the Avengers which claims they're threats to [[national security]].{{issue|date=July 2013}} When the investigation ends, the Senate committee gives the Avengers new guidelines to follow; they also name Raymond Sikorski as his successor.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Writer [[Peter David]] has indicated that Shooter based Gyrich on himself. David attempted to humanize him by giving him some backstory in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #456 (August 1997), which touched upon Gyrich's family life. After [[Betty Ross|Betty Banner]] criticizes Gyrich for appearing callous and unfeeling when mentioning the pain of [[Thunderbolt Ross|her own father]] dying, Gyrich cuts Banner off, saying "My father died of [[Alzheimer's]], [Betty]. I took a year’s leave to care for him so he wouldn’t be watched over by strangers that my crummy salary couldn’t even afford. I cleaned up after him, tended to him, and his last words as I cradled his dying body were, 'Who in heck are you?'".<ref>[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/005313.html "Q&A" entry on David's blog; April 14, 2007 (The information on this point is in the April 16, 2005, 9:31 a.m. post.)]</ref> As a result, it is revealed in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' that Gyrich’s greatest fear is contracting the same disease that killed his father. After a confrontation with [[Iron Man]], Gyrich is apparently fired from his Initiative position, as he later makes a statement claiming at a press conference that he had decided to "retire" to spend time with his family. When a reporter points out that Gyrich ''has'' no living family, he declines to elaborate.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Prior to his involvement with the Avengers, Gyrich was NSA Liaison to [[Canada]]'s Department H. While there, he met and had repeated issues with their chief agent [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gyrich becomes a member of the [[Registration acts (comics)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]], the oversight body on [[posthuman|superhuman]] activities in the United States; there he's part of the team that forces [[Captain America]] to resign. Gyrich also takes part as a special consultant in [[Project Wideawake|a covert government]] designed to deal with the problems concerning [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] in the [[United States]]. The project is instrumental in creating [[Freedom Force (comics)|a team of mutants]] to counter the threat of foreign mutants.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Dire Wraith===
Henry Gyrich is later involved in war efforts against the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s. This time, he works alongside [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], a mutant who works as a weapons maker for the U.S. government and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Gyrich takes Forge's specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun to capture the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] for breaking into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. In an encounter with Rogue, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shoots Storm. This specialized weapon strips Storm's powers and abilities as a mutant but regains them some time later. Gyrich continues attempting to use Forge’s own version of the [[Rom the Spaceknight|Spaceknight Rom]]’s [[Spaceknight Rom's Neutralizer|Neutralizer]], planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. Rom and Forge stop him, however, and he can only watch, tied up, as Rom banishes Wraithworld (the Dire Wraith's home world) instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich is also involved in hunting the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after the events of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Hunted by Others===
Henry Gyrich is targeted for assassination by the current form of the Mutant Liberation Front, led by the energy-casting [[Reignfire]]. His lack of gratitude for being rescued is part of what led the mutant [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] to defect from [[X-Force (comics)|X-Force]] to the MLF.<ref>"X-Force" Vol. 1 #27-28 (Oct. Nov. 1993)</ref> Gyrich is a key player in [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s [[Operation: Zero Tolerance|program]]. He is a faithful believer in the operation until he himself becomes a target of [[Prime Sentinels]]. After being rescued by [[Spider-Man]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], Gyrich demands the program be shut down.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gyrich is promoted to succeed [[Valerie Cooper]] as the head of the Commission on Superhuman Activities. While there, [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] secretly places Gyrich under the control of [[Nanorobotics|nanites]]. Gyrich uses Commission resources and remolds the vigilante [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]] into the assassin [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] and attempts to live out his “fantasy” of killing all the world's superhumans, before being stopped by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Following that incident, he is reassigned to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and is made the liaison for the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] as well as the Avengers’ new liaison to the [[United Nations]] (by Captain America’s suggestion). During this time, he redeems himself in the eyes of the team when he refuses to deliver information on the Avengers to the [[Red Skull]] (disguised as the [[Secretary of Defense]] Dell Rusk). He never breaks, even under severe torture, which impresses the others. Now a faithful liaison officer to the Avengers, Gyrich’s job comes to an end after the United Nations ends their relationship with the Avengers.<ref>''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''</ref>

Following the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Gyrich is the Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces. His base of operations is [[Camp Hammond (comics)|the superhuman training facility]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. It is under his orders that the [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] is drafted as the facility’s [[Drill Instructor]]. This comes after Gauntlet saves him from a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] attack in Iraq.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1 (April 2007)</ref> Gyrich gives orders to cover up the death of [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]]. He makes arrangements to provide a special tutor to [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]] through his old friend [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 (May 2007)</ref> The tutor is revealed to be depowered mutant [[Dani Moonstar]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref> They don't get along well and Gyrich fires Moonstar for training Trauma to use powers to help people with debilitating phobias instead of using them as a weapon. After the [[Michael Van Patrick#KIA|KIA]] debacle, Gyrich was removed from the Initiative program completely by Iron Man after a heated argument between the two in which Gyrich throws out the line "You've got Captain America's blood on your hands!" during the inquiry into why the KIA disaster happened in the first place.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> At a press conference at the end of the issue, Gyrich claims he is retiring, and walks off.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gyrich becomes the main antagonist for Kieron Gillen and Steven Sander's new series ''[[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D]].''. He joins [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] (Sentient World Observation and Response Department) under [[Norman Osborn]]'s orders and becomes the co-leader alongside [[Abigail Brand]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}

In the first volume, Gyrich manages to kidnap several notable aliens including [[Noh-Varr]], [[Adam X]], [[Jazinda]], [[Karolina Dean]] and [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]], all in his desire to send aliens home. He also arrests both Brand and Lockheed.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D.'' #2</ref> Gyrich survives an alien takeover of the installation simply by being too dosed on intruder-neutralization gas to be much of a threat. Brand, with the assistance of several super-powered beings, takes back the job and blackmails Gyrich into leaving S.W.O.R.D. alone.<ref>''S.W.O.R.D. Volume 1: No Time To Breathe'' (120 pages, July 2010, ISBN 0-7851-4076-X) (2010)</ref>

It is unknown if he was brainwashed by HYDRA or it was by his own will, Gyrich worked along them to control [[Demolition Man (comics)|Dennis Dunphy]] and turn into the new [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] in order to kill criminals and "fix the system". After Captain America tended him a trap, he was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D..<ref>''Captain America'' #12-13</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the “[[Age of Apocalypse]]” alternate timeline storyline, Gyrich is an anti-mutant suicide bomber who threatens to destroy Heaven, [[Angel (Marvel Comics)|Angel]]’s club. He is defeated by the Bedlam Brothers.

He was returned in the current "Age of Apocalypse" on-going, as a leader in the human resistance. He lost his legs, in "the offensive to blow the Seattle power core", confining him to a wheelchair, and is seen helping evaluate the now powerless Jean Grey.<ref>''Factor X'' #1</ref>

===Mutant X===
In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic, Gyrich is the government’s liaison to the Avengers. In issue #26, he calls for the aid of the Six to search for Dracula after forces break the vampire out of the prison [[Vault (comics)|the Vault]].<ref>"Mutant X" #26 (December 2000)</ref> In this continuity, he again has a serious problem with [[Captain America]].

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] iteration of Henry Gyrich visually looks like his mainstream counterpart albeit with blond hair. Working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], he is trying to establish a check and balance system for [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and the [[Ultimates]] in case. When a rapidly aged clone of Spider-Man was lead to believe into being [[Richard and Mary Parker|Dr. Richard "Ray" Parker]], the clone's backstory included to continue the [[Venom (comics)|Venom project]] for Gyrich.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #100</ref> <ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103</ref> However, the real Gyrich make appearances at the end of the [[Clone Saga]] arc, working instead for the [[FBI]] leading a strike team to find Otto Octavius.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #104</ref> During a battle between [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], Fury distracts Gyrich by asking confusing questions and confronting him about the illegal "Spider-Clone" program that had been going on behind [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]’s back.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #105</ref>
