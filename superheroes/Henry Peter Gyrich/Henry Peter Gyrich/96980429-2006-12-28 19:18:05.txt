'''Henry Peter Gyrich''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]], who was named after a then-employee of Marvel Comics. The fictional character Gyrich is most notable for his work in the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. He first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 1 #165 (November 1977) and was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[George Perez]].

==Character biography==

When he first appeared, he was the first person to be given the title of US Government Liaison to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by the [[National Security Agency]]. With his status, Gyrich was one of only two humans (the second being the [[President of the United States]]) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure with the Avengers, Gyrich revoked their priority status after noting several (in his mind) problems with the team. The Avengers had to accept Gyrich's "suggestions" or not be able to use their Quinjets and other sensitive equipment again. He limited the Avengers' active membership to seven members, forced the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to join against his will to fill a quota, and installed various security measures for the team.

Gyrich oversaw the Avengers' activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbade them to go on a mission to help [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. The next incident involved a security leak. Gyrich took part in a [[United States Senate|Senate]] investigation involving the Avengers which claimed they were threats to [[national security]]. When the investigation was over, the Senate committee gave the Avengers new guidelines to follow; they also named Raymond Sikorski as his successor.

===Commission on Superhuman Activities===
Gyrich became a member of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, the oversight body on [[posthuman|superhuman]] activities in the United States; there he was part of the team that forced [[Captain America]] to resign. Gyrich also took part in Project: Wideawake as a special consultant. This project was a covert government commission designed to deal with the problems concerning [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]] in [[United States|America]]. The project was instrumental in creating a team of mutants to counter the threat of foreign mutants. This team was called [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. 

Gyrich later became involved in the United States' war efforts against the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s.  This time, he worked alongside [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], a mutant who worked as a weapons maker for the U.S. government & [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Gyrich took a specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun of Forge's to capture the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] because she had broken into a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. In an encounter with Rogue, [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shot Storm. This specialized weapon stripped Storm of her powers and abilities as a mutant, although she regained them some time later. Gyrich continued attempting to use Forge's own version of the Spaceknight Rom's Neutralizer, planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. He was stopped in the attempt by Rom and Forge, and could only watch, tied up, as Rom banished Wraithworld instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich was also involved in hunting the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] after the events of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

===Operation: Zero Tolerance===
Gyrich became a key player in [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s Operation: Zero Tolerance. He was a faithful believer in Bastion's operation until he himself became a target of [[Prime Sentinels]]. After being rescued by [[Spider-Man]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], Gyrich demanded the operation be shut down.

===Destroy Earth's superhumans===
He was promoted to succeed [[Val Cooper|Valerie Cooper]] as the head of the Commission on Superhuman Activities. [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker]] placed Gyrich under the control of [[Nanorobotics|nanites]]. Gyrich used Commission resources and remolded the vigilante [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]] into the assassin [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] and attempted to live out his "fantasy" of killing all the world's superhumans, before being stopped by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

===Return to the Avengers===
Following that incident, he was reassigned to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and was made the liaison for [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] as well as the Avengers' new liaison (this time, by [[Captain America]]'s suggestion) to the [[United Nations]]. During this time, he redeemed himself in the eyes of the team when he refused to deliver information on the Avengers to the [[Secretary of State]], Dell Rusk (secretly, the [[Red Skull]]). Gyrich was a faithful liaison officer to the Avengers. During [[Avengers Disassembled]], Gyrich's job came to an end after the United Nations ended their relationship with the Avengers.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Gyrich is an anti-mutant suicide bomber that threatens to destroy Heaven, Angel's club. He is defeated by the Bedlam Brothers.

===Mutant X===
In the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic, Gyrich is the government's liaison to the Avengers. He called for the aid of the Six, to search for Dracula.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comic, Gyrich works for the CIA. He is trying to establish a check and balance system for [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]]'s super police force.  He hires [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], [[Peter Parker]]'s father, after he survives an assisination attempt by [[Bolivar Trask]] to continue and develop the [[Venom]] project in order to have the firepower to oppose Nick Fury and his super soldiers.

==In other media==

===Animation===
Gyrich appeared in the first episode of the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated series]]; "[[Night of the Sentinels (Part 1)]]" and "[[Night of the Sentinels (Part 2)]]" and was voiced by Barry Flatman.  He also appeared in the season one finale "The Final Decision", season four episode "Courage" and series finale "Graduation Day".  Gyrich's personality in the series was an extreme take on that of his appearances in the Avengers and X-Men comic books as he supported mutant oppression and possibly even extinction whereas in the comics he was merely distrustful of superhumans in general.  In the series finale, he quickly revealed that Professor Charles Xavier was a mutant by calling on a force wave with a remote, which revealed his power of telepathy at a worldwide conference.  This weakened Xavier and killed him by the end of the episode, even though he could be recooperated on another planet by an alien friend (and former lover) he had.  This attack also nearly wounded many other people at the conference.  Gyrich was taken away to custody because of his insanity, but warned everyone not to trust anyone, because they might well be a mutant.

===Film===
Gyrich made a brief cameo in the [[X-Men]] movie as an aide to [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]], although it was quickly revealed that "he" was actually [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who had murdered the real Gyrich and taken his place. At the end of the movie, a television news report can be heard saying that Gyrich's body was found, apparently mauled by a bear. This implies that the real Gyrich was actually killed by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].  Gyrich/Mystique was played by [[Matthew Sharp]].
