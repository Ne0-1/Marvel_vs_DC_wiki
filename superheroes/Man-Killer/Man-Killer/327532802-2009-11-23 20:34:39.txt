==Fictional character biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
'''Katrina Luisa Van Horn''' was an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[skiing|skier]] and is a militant [[feminism|feminist]].  After engaging in an argument with anti-Women's Liberation skier Karl Lubbings, the two took their disagreement to the slopes.  Katrina was an Olympic-level skier, but Lubbings cut her off and both skiers plunged off the mountain.  Katrina was severely injured and disfigured.  She was fitted with a powered [[exoskeleton]], and took the name Man-Killer (she no longer wears the exoskeleton so it is probable her strength has been enhanced somehow).  She has worked freelance and as an agent for [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]].  She has been a member of the [[Masters of Evil]] under the [[Crimson Cowl]].  As '''Amazon''', she was briefly a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] under [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].  She had fought [[Spider-Man]] on some occasions.

During an altercation with the Thunderbolts, Katrina told [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] that she'd rather not fight her, as she had no problems with women, just with men.  (Songbird attacked her anyway.)  Some time later, however, [[Erik Josten]]—Atlas of the Thunderbolts—discovered Katrina working as a bartender in his team's adopted home of Burton Canyon, [[Colorado]].  When Josten became a regular at the bar Katrina was congenial towards him, pretending not to recognize him as Atlas.  Whatever animosity Katrina may or may not bear towards men, she has proven herself capable of working alongside them with a minimum of personality conflicts.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==
Robotic implants replacing and/or compounded with bones and nerves, which give her superhuman powers, good athletic abilities, and the ability to throw knives at a range of hundreds of meters.

She was given Pym particles to grow in strength proportionate to size.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

== Notes ==
* While initially not confirmed, it was strongly implied for years that Katrina was a [[lesbian]].  One example of this occurs in ''Thunderbolts'' v.1 #71 when she, [[Cyclone (comics)|Cyclone]] and [[Cardinal (comics)|Harrier]] decide to abandon [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] and [[Plantman]] to be captured by agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Hawkeye and [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]] capture the trio and attempt to coerce them into going back for Songbird and Plantman, before a S.H.I.E.L.D. search party catches up with them and forces them to fight for their freedom. While Cyclone and Harrier remain tied up, Katrina is freed and subdues a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative who is about to drag them away to be incarcerated. Cyclone asks that she untie them so they can escape, referring to her as "Man-Killer."  She makes no move to help them escape and says that she'd rather be called "Amazon", her heroic, Thunderbolts name. Cyclone realizes that she now intends to join Hawkeye and Gypsy Moth in acting noble and laments "One more goes to the other side..." Katrina, apparently misunderstanding, responds "I was ''born'' on that side, Frenchie." Her sexuality was eventually confirmed in her profile in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z]]'' #7 (2006).

* Other less obvious clues to her lesbianism include: 
** A panel in ''Thunderbolts'' #42 that shows her wearing pins that say [[Indigo Girls]], [[Lilith Fair]] & [[Xena]].
** That same issue she mocks the notion of being romantically involved with [[Erik Josten]].

* Katrina once used the alias Wilma when she was working as a bartender. Presumably this was an homage to the famous feminist [[Wilma Mankiller]].
