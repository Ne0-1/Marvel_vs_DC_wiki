'''Stilt-Man''', aka '''Wilbur Day''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], most commonly associated with [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]].

Stilt-Man appeared in ''Daredevil'' #8 and was one of the earliest enemies of the blind hero. Day had engineered himself a pair of extremely long, [[telescopic]] metal legs, which allowed him to tower high over the ground.

The character did not age well, as his powers were more a curiosity than a real threat. As of 2005, Stilt-Man is seen as a mere footnote and as an example of the arguably weird rogues' gallery Daredevil had in his early, pre-[[Frank Miller]] days â€” indeed, during Miller's ''Daredevil'' run, issue #186, Stilt-Man was portrayed as a miserable loser; he was cold-cocked and had the armor stolen by Turk, a small-time crook and an even greater loser than Day, who took on the Stilt-Man identity, contacted the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and offered to become his new assassin, only to be refused. ("It does not matter what armor or weapons you may have acquired, Turk. You are an idiot. I do not employ idiots.")

Enraged by Turk's audacity, Day contacted Daredevil and informed him of a weakness in the armor. Thanks to Day's information, Daredevil easily disabled the auto-gyroscopes and brought Turk down. Day later modified the armor to prevent Daredevil for using this newfound knowledge against him.

Stilt-Man has continued to make sporadic appearances in various Marvel comics, wherein he has continued his criminal career and fought several superheroes, but without much success.
