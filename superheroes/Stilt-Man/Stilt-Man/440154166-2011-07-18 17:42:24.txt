'''Stilt-Man''' is the name of two supervillains in [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Stilt-Man first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 1 #8 and was one of his earliest enemies. He is a criminal wearing a suit of armor with powerful telescopic legs (useful for high-story heists).

The character did not age well, as his powers were more a curiosity than a real threat. As of 2008, Stilt-Man is seen as a mere footnote and as an example of the arguably weird rogues' gallery Daredevil had in his early, pre-[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] days — indeed, during Miller's ''Daredevil'' run, Stilt-Man was portrayed as a miserable loser.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #186</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Wilbur Day===
'''Wilbur Day''' was born in [[New York City]]. As a scientist, inventor, and engineer, he was employed by Carl Kaxton, who invented a hydraulic ram device. Wilbur stole Kaxton's designs and used them to engineer a pair of extremely long, [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescopic]] metal legs, which allowed him to tower high over the ground. He incorporated these hydraulic stilts into armored battlesuit, which he created for use in robberies as the professional criminal '''Stilt-Man'''. He battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and was seemingly shrunk into nothingness when he was accidentally hit by an experimental molecular condenser ray.<ref>''Daredevil'' #8</ref> His return from the limbo-like "microverse" was later recounted, and he attempted to help [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]] escape from custody. Stilt-Man was defeated by Daredevil again, but was helped to escape by the [[Masked Marauder]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #26</ref> Stilt-Man teamed with the Masked Marauder in an attempt to trap Daredevil; however, he battled [[Spider-Man]] and was defeated by Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #27</ref> His escape from Daredevil aided by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] was later recounted. Stilt-Man teamed with Electro, [[Matador (comics)|Matador]], Leap-Frog, and [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]] to form the original [[Emissaries of Evil]] and battle Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1</ref> Stilt-Man was later hired by mobsters to kill district attorney candidate [[Foggy Nelson]], and battled Daredevil once again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #48</ref> He disguised himself as [[Stuntmaster (comics)|Stunt-Master]], and attacked Daredevil on a Hollywood movie set.<ref>''Daredevil'' #67</ref> In San Francisco, he kidnapped his former employer Carl Kaxton and his daughter, to force him to recreate his molecular condenser. However, Stilt-Man battled and was defeated by Daredevil and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #102</ref>

Besides Stilt-Man's long, unsuccessful career against Daredevil, he encountered other superheroes in the meantime. He was hired by Los Angeles mobsters to kill the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and in the process stole various weapons and devices from the [[Trapster]].<ref>''Captain America'' #191</ref> He robbed a Los Angeles bank, and battled the [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]]. He teleported Black Goliath and his companions to an alien planet using the Z-ray weapon.<ref>''Black Goliath'' #4</ref> Stilt-Man attacked Black Goliath at [[Champions (comics)|Champions]] headquarters in search of an alien power source. He battled the Champions, and his Z-ray weapon was destroyed by [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]], but he managed to escape the Champions.<ref>''Champions'' #11-12</ref> He was later freed from prison by [[Blastaar]] and F.A.U.S.T., and given a special new battlesuit constructed of secondary [[adamantium]] with additional weaponry. He stole some radioactive isotopes, and battled [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], but lost the fight and was stripped of his suit by the victorious thunder god who confiscated it.<ref>''Thor'' #269</ref>

Stilt-Man was hired to kidnap assistant District Attorney Maxine Lavender. He was waylaid in his civilian identity by Turk Barrett, a small-time crook and an even greater loser than Day, who cold-cocked Day, stole his armor, and took on the Stilt-Man identity. Turk contacted the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and offered to become his new assassin, only to be refused, being told "It does not matter what armor or weapons you may have acquired, Turk. You are an idiot. I do not employ idiots". Enraged by Turk's audacity, Day contacted Daredevil and informed him of a weakness in the armor. Thanks to Day's information, Daredevil easily disabled the auto-gyroscopes necessary for the armor to keep its balance and brought Turk down.<ref>''Daredevil'' #186</ref> Day later modified the armor to prevent Daredevil for using this newfound knowledge against him.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Stilt-Man sought to regain his reputation by defeating Spider-Man. He turned an automated Cordco factory against Spider-Man, but when Spider-Man saved his life, Stilt-Man returned the favor by not taking the opportunity to kill him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #237</ref>

Stilt-Man continued to make sporadic appearances in various Marvel comics, wherein he has continued his criminal career and fought several superheroes, but without much success. One of his most prominent appearances during this time was during the [[Iron Man]] storyline "[[Armor Wars]]", where he was one of the many armored super-villains whose armors had been secretly upgraded with technology stolen from Tony Stark; Iron Man quickly defeated the villain in their confrontation by throwing one of his own hydraulic legs at him to knock him out.<ref>''Iron Man'' #225</ref> Stilt-Man later attempted to kill District Attorney [[Blake Tower]] for sending him to prison, but was captured by [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #4</ref> Stilt-Man was among the villains assembled by [[Doctor Doom]] to attack the [[Fantastic Four]] in Washington, D.C. during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]''. Even though he had several other villains with him, he failed miserably.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #336</ref> He was also among the villains who attempted to attack the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] at the site of their reconstructed [[Avengers Mansion|mansion]], but was foiled by the construction workers.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #19 (1990)</ref>

In the 2006 issues of [[Heroes for Hire]], a version of Stilt-Man's armor can be found in a police storehouse with other villains' equipment under their names. The armor seen here is labeled "Case: NYC v. Turk ("Loser")".<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' 2006 #12</ref>, and is used by Scorpion during her battle with Paladin.

Later, Daredevil's secret identity of Matt Murdock was exposed by a local newspaper, with Murdock denying the allegations. On hearing of this news, Wilbur visited the law offices of Nelson and Murdock, announcing he was sick of the whole ordeal and that he was retiring as Stilt-Man. He left his armor in a suitcase on Murdock's desk, and was forcibly removed when he began yelling his paranoid conclusion that Murdock was the real Kingpin. Murdock then jokingly asked his law partner, Foggy Nelson, if he'd like to be the next Stilt-Man, an offer he quickly declined.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #41</ref>

During this period, Day romanced and eventually married [[Circus of Crime]] member [[Princess Python]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Then, when the [[Superhero Registration Act]] offered Day a chance at redemption, he signed up with the government and was outfitted with a new suit of armor to serve as a law enforcer during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Unfortunately for Day, one of his assignments led him into conflict with the [[Punisher]]. Both were tracking a convicted child pornographer who was already in FBI custody. The Punisher paralyzes Stilt-Man with a [[M72 LAW]], and then shoots him at point-blank range, killing him. The pornographer is killed moments later.<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal#Volume Two|Punisher War Journal]]'' #1</ref>

Day's funeral was held in the Bar With No Name, and was attended by his fellow also-rans of the crime world. Sadness turned to remembrance, which turned into high spirits, which eventually led to a full-scale fight breaking out. The appearance of [[Spider-Man]] put an end to the violence, but the bar was then promptly blown up by the Punisher in an attempt to kill all the villains inside. It was later mentioned that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn (injury)|third-degree burns]]."<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' (volume 2) #17 </ref>

===Successors===
During Day's absence from the world of costumed crime, an as-yet-unnamed criminal acquired the Stilt-Man armor. After upgrading its telescoping abilities, this Stilt-Man was defeated by Daredevil and [[Luke Cage]]. The fight only lasted as long as it did because Daredevil was afraid of knocking the villain out at his current height as the fall would have killed him.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> He was next seen being dispatched by [[Ms. Marvel]] in her new series.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' Vol 2 #1</ref>

A third Stilt-Man was chosen by a gang of small time petty thugs. Michael Watts, claimed to know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that leads to the connection of the [[Tinkerer]], who apparently upgraded the suit before his last arrest. Punisher was aware of the gang's actions. But after some convincing by the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], Frank let Watts live, who quotes "You punish the guilty Frank, not the stupid." Watts believes he and his gang will rise to great things since the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s coming to power over the supervillains.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol. 2 #26</ref>

A fourth female variant appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #611, calling herself "'''Lady Stilt-Man'''". [[Deadpool]] defeats her by removing a manhole cover, causing one of her legs to fall in, and her other to step onto a high heel attached to the top of a truck. She doesn't appear to be connected to any of the other Stilt-Men, and claims her using the name as an "homage".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #611</ref> This version is more clumsy and uncoordinated, and Spider-Man himself says she is "trying too hard."

==Powers and abilities==
Day is a competent, although perhaps not genius, engineer and inventor, with degrees in physics and mechanical engineering. He is also a moderately talented disguise artist.

Day often uses a gun capable of producing a potent stun gas. He has also used gas grenades, a charged-particle beam blaster, a vacuum device, an electrified exterior for his suit, various devices stolen from the [[Trapster]], and various conventional weaponry.

Stilt-Man designed and constructed his battle suit, which increases his strength 10 fold, enabling him to lift (press) approximately {{convert|1500|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>''Official Handbook Of the Marvel Universe'' (1986 series) #17</ref> The suit's telescopic legs contain hydraulic rams which allow them to be used as battering rams, able to stretch up to 250' and also allow him to walk up to {{convert|30|mi/h|km/h}}. His legs are also coated with a silicone compound that prevents Spider-Man's webbing from adhering to them. Carl Kaxton designed the hydraulic ram device, but Wilbur Day designed the hydraulic stilts and weaponry as part of his battlesuit.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Stilt-Man is shown as a human using technological equipment who was arrested by the FBI's [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies===
In "[[Marvel Zombies]]" Stilt-Man is seen a part of the horde of zombified super-villains attacking Galactus when he arrives upon Earth. The World-Devourer is brought down by the combined efforts of the Power Cosmic Zombies, but the super-villains try to claim the body and a scrap ensues.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

A zombified Stilt-Man appears in the limited series, "[[Marvel Zombies 3]]". He is among the group of zombies guarding the compound run by the zombified [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. He is referred to as "... a roving sentry with unlimited sightlines". He confronts [[Machine Man]] who is attempting to escape the compound. The android, also on stilts, teases Stilt-Man with how their similaries they might have been friends. Stilt-Man wonders if Machine Man is being serious; he is not and Stilt-Man is quickly destroyed.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #2-3 (2009)</ref> Another Stilt-Man is seen in another zombie-infested dimension, his body had been picked clean and left to lay in the debris of New York for decades.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return: Avengers'' (September 2009)</ref>
