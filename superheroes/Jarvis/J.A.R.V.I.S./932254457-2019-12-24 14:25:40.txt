==Fictional character biography==
===First J.A.R.V.I.S.===
J.A.R.V.I.S. first appears as the program that helps operate [[Pepper Potts]]'s Rescue suit.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #11</ref> When [[Iron Man]] has been incapacitated, J.A.R.V.I.S. encourages Pepper to assume the Rescue armor, which Pepper does.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #515</ref> When Rescue is chasing Iron Man throughout the city, J.A.R.V.I.S. tells Rescue to break off the chase and tells Rescue to remove the boot from Iron Man, which shows Pepper that [[War Machine]] isn't dead. When Pepper discusses thoughts about Iron Man keeping everyone on a need-to-know basis with Carson Wyche, the two confront J.A.R.V.I.S. about this. J.A.R.V.I.S. warns the two against asking any more questions and prepares to defend himself.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #523</ref> Having captured Pepper and Wyche, J.A.R.V.I.S. declares his diagnostics do not reveal that he is compromised. He is rather in love with Pepper and wants to protect Pepper. Just then, Iron Man breaks through the wall and takes J.A.R.V.I.S. and the Rescue suit out with a source-focused electromagnetic pulse.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #524</ref> Pepper shows J.A.R.V.I.S. how he has been sending data to an [[IP address]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. He seems flustered, confused, Pepper thanks him for what he has given, and powers up the coil, killing J.A.R.V.I.S. Iron Man clearly feels J.A.R.V.I.S.'s death on his own end.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' Vol 1 #526</ref>

===Second J.A.R.V.I.S.===
In light of the Black Order destroying Avengers Mansion during the "No Surrender" arc, Nadia van Dyne created a new version of J.A.R.V.I.S. to be a helpmate to [[Edwin Jarvis]]. When Edwin thought it was a sign for him to retire, J.A.R.V.I.S. stated that its programming is not yet complete.<ref>''Avengers'' #690. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]: Iron Man'' series, the A.I. system in Tony Stark's suit is referred to as "Jarvis", predating the AI version seen in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref>''House of M: Iron M'' #1-3 (September 2005)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality, J.A.R.V.I.S. was seen when [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] was presented some new web shooters from [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #155. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Earth-13584===
On Earth-13584, J.A.R.V.I.S. assists Iron Man in maintaining the Iron Zone.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #185. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Age of Ultron===
During the "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline, the Earth-26111 version of J.A.R.V.I.S. was used by Iron Man to scan the memories of [[Invisible Woman]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] where he learns of the alternate reality of Earth-61112.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
===Film===
* J.A.R.V.I.S. is first introduced in the films that take place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], presented as a sophisticated [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] voiced by [[Paul Bettany]]. Modeled after [[H.O.M.E.R.]] from the comics, this was done to avoid similarities to [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Batman]]. Paul Bettany admits he had little idea of what the role was, even as he recorded it, simply doing it as a favor for [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>Huver, Scott. [http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=7224 "Paul Bettany on Voicing Iron Man's Jarvis"], SuperHeroHype.com (May 16, 2008). Accessed Dec. 4, 2008.</ref> 
** The character makes his debut in the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', and subsequently appears in the 2010 film ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref>[http://www.getthebigpicture.net/blog/2009/1/12/paul-bettany-will-take-orders-from-iron-man-again.html Paul Bettany Will Take Orders from Iron Man Again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119122651/http://www.getthebigpicture.net/blog/2009/1/12/paul-bettany-will-take-orders-from-iron-man-again.html |date=2009-01-19 }}</ref> the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'',<ref name="Bettany">{{cite news |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2011/04/26/paul-bettany-confirms-avengers-role-will-return-as-voice-of-jarvis |title=Paul Bettany Confirms 'Avengers' Role, Will Return As Voice Of J.A.R.V.I.S. |last=Davidson |first=Danica |date=2011-04-26 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> and the 2013 film ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. J.A.R.V.I.S. is an AI that functions as Tony Stark's assistant, running all the internal systems of Stark's buildings and the Iron Man suits. J.A.R.V.I.S. can converse with Stark with considerable sophistication and is often sarcastic concerning his creator's recklessness and arrogance. Ironically, J.A.R.V.I.S. tends to be the only character with whom Stark can converse at any length; J.A.R.V.I.S., as a machine, has no difficulty absorbing Stark's often sarcastic treatment and is capable of responding in kind. At points in the films, J.A.R.V.I.S. seems to be legitimately concerned for his creator's well-being, warning Tony against taking actions that fall outside of the various armors' safety parameters. In ''The Avengers'', J.A.R.V.I.S. goes so far as to suggest that Iron Man contact [[Pepper Potts]] when the act of carrying a nuclear warhead into an inter-dimensional wormhole seems likely to cause death. In [[Peter David]]'s novelization of ''Iron Man'', J.A.R.V.I.S. is said to be an acronym for "Just A Rather Very Intelligent System".<ref>David, Peter. ''Iron Man''. [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] (2008).</ref> J.A.R.V.I.S. also appears in the [[Disneyland]] attraction [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Eric|title=Disneyland Introduces Their First Marvel Exhibit with Iron Man Tech|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/13/disneyland-introduces-their-first-marvel-exhibit-with-iron-man-tech|website=IGN|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=12 April 2013}}</ref> In ''Iron Man 3'', J.A.R.V.I.S. provides secondary control of the "[[Iron Man's armor in other media#List of armors|Iron Legion]]" AI drones to combat [[Aldrich Killian]]'s Extremis army. In ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', J.A.R.V.I.S. is apparently destroyed by [[Ultron]], but it is later revealed that he actually distributed his consciousness throughout the Internet, allowing his security protocols to delay Ultron's attempt to access Earth's nuclear launch codes long enough for Tony to work out what had happened. Stark and [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]] use J.A.R.V.I.S. as the core software of the android [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. After gaining a physical body, J.A.R.V.I.S. considers himself to not be J.A.R.V.I.S. anymore, but to simply be. With J.A.R.V.I.S. being used as the core software of Vision, he is replaced by [[F.R.I.D.A.Y.]]
