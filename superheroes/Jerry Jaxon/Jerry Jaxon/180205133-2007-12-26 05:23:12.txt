'''Jerome “Jerry” Jaxon''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Jerome Jaxon was born in [[Red Deer, Alberta]], Canada.  Due to brain damage, Jaxon was left permanently unable to walk.  Jerry was the executive vice president of [[Roxxon Oil]], and a former executive vice president in charge of research and development at Am-Can Petroleum Company.  He had a wife and two children, but was estranged from them.

Jaxon was the founder and leader of [[Omega Flight]].  He contacted several superhumans, including [[Diamond Lil (comics)|Diamond Lil]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], [[Flashback (comics)|Flashback]], [[Smart Alec (comics)|Smart Alec]], from [[Gamma Flight]] and stole the controlling helmet of the original [[Box (comics)|Box]] from Roger Bochs.  Jaxon used the robot to attack [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]]. During the battle Guardian managed to damage Box and the feedback killed Jaxon, but the damage sustained during the battle caused Guardian's suit to explode later.
