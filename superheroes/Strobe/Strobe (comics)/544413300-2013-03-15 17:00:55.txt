'''Strobe''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. She was created for the villainous team the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF) as the main [[antithesis]] for [[X-Force]]. She made her debut in ''New Mutants'' #86.

==Fictional character biography==
During the legislation which proposed the enactment of the ''Mutant Registration Act'', two members of the [[New Mutants]]—[[Skids (comics)|Skids]] and [[Rusty Collins]]—were imprisoned for refusing to sign. After this atrocity, the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (MLF), including Strobe, first came on the scene to demand the liberation of the pair. They destroy an energy plant as proof of their convictions. The group tries to free them by force, but this only ends in confusion. During the break-in, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tries to intervene and a prison guard accidentally shoots Rusty. Skids believes that it was Cable who shot her friend, so she decides to side with the MLF.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

The New Mutants track the team down to [[Madripoor]] and get in a few conflicts with them. Even with the help of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], the MLF manages to capture several of the New Mutants. However, their victory is short-lived with the arrival of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] who helps the teens liberate their [[kidnap]]ped friends. But before the MLF can be caught, they [[Teleportation|teleport]] to safety.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Strobe next appears with an MLF strike force who attempt to break [[Nasty Boys]] members [[Slab (comics)|Slab]] and [[Hairbag]] out of prison. They succeed and then set their eyes on destroying the Tucker clinic, however they are thwarted by [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] who had been tipped off by MLF member [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]]. With their leader almost being captured, the MLF once more escapes to freedom.<ref>''X-Factor'' #77-78 (1992)</ref>

As the events of the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' begin to unfold, the MLF finds itself collecting an array of ancient [[relic]]s. The team, including Strobe, split into strike forces to steal the various artifacts that will help [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] from his slumber. Later on, in ''X-factor #85'', the New Mutants, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the [[X-Men]] discovered the latest MLF base in Dust Bowl, [[Arkansas]]. After an intense battle, all member of the MLF are captured and taken into custody, though Strobe was able to severely damage Rogue's eyesight, resulting in a long recovery.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} After this, Strobe never made a reappearance.

However, in the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]—an event in which a [[mentally ill]] [[Scarlet Witch]] depowered over 90% of the mutant population—Strobe was shown to be one of the many who lost her powers (''revealed in [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] #18'').
