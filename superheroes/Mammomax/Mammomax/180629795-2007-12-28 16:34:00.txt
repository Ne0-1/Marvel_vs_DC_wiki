'''Mammomax''' is a [[fictional]] [[mammoth]]-shaped human [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] who exists in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Mammomax's first appearance was [[X-Men]] vol. 2 #161.

==Fictional character biography==
When Mammomax first appears, he was part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] alongside [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]], and [[Black Tom Cassidy]]. He participates in an attack on the X-Mansion, which causes massive property damage and the deaths of at least two of the residents. They were a young child named Samuel and one of the cafeteria staff, a lady with four arms. Mammomax did not directly kill either of these people. 

[[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] defeats him. The entire Brotherhood ends up sucked into the black hole within [[Xorn]]'s head, which apparently leads to the [[Mojoverse]].

===After M-Day===
Mammomax next appeares after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], on the run from members of the Sapien League with [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and [[Peepers]].<ref>Decimation: The Day After</ref> At the Institute's front gates, the X-Men save him from being burned alive. He took up residence on the Institute's grounds with other members of the 198. He also forms a friendship with Erg, [[Fever Pitch (comics)|Fever Pitch]], and [[Sack (comics)|Sack]]. During a recent outing into Salem Center, he attacks a boy for calling him "[[The Elephant Man (film)|Elephant Man]]", but a "tracking chip", implanted in his head by [[Sentinel (comics)|The Office of National Emergency]] (O*N*E), disables him before he could do any damage. Mammomax has the device removed by [[Mister M (comics)|Mister M]]. The other members of the 198 also have their chips nuetralized. Mammomax follows Mr. M during his exodus from the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. 

===The End of Mammomax===
Recently Mammomax was captured by the Facility, the same group responsible for the creation of [[X-23]]. He is used as a test subject for a monster ([[Predator X]]) created by the Facility staff. Predator X consumes and kills him.<ref>New X-Men vol. 2 #33-34</ref> A picture of his corpse is shown to [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)| Mercury]], who had also been taken by the organization.

==Powers and abilities==
Mammomax looks like a bipedal elephant with hands, because of this he is as strong as an elephant and also possess a pair of large ivory tusks which are as durable as an elephant's. Mammomax has invulnerable skin and can also produce powerful stomach acid which he can spit out of his mouth and use as a projectile attack.

==Other versions==
===[[House of M]]===
Mammomax is a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].
