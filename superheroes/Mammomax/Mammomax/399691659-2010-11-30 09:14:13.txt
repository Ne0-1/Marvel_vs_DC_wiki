===After M-Day===
Mammomax next appears after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], on the run from members of the Sapien League with [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and [[Peepers]].<ref>Decimation: The Day After</ref> At the Institute's front gates, the X-Men save him from being burned alive.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} He took up residence on the Institute's grounds with other members of the 198. He also forms a friendship with Erg, [[Fever Pitch (comics)|Fever Pitch]], and [[Sack (comics)|Sack]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}} During an outing into Salem Center, he attacks a boy for calling him "[[The Elephant Man (film)|Elephant Man]]", but a "tracking chip", implanted in his head by the [[Office of National Emergency]] (O*N*E), disables him before he could do any damage.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Mammomax has the device removed by [[Mister M (comics)|Mister M]].
