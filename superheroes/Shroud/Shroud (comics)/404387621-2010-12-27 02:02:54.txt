'''Shroud''' ('''Maximillian Quincy Coleridge''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'' #5, (April 1976), and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Herb Trimpe]].

==Conception==
Englehart has acknowledged that the character was intended as a "mashup" of [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]] and [[The Shadow#Comic strips and comic books|The Shadow]].<ref>Cronin, Brian. [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/10/30/comic-book-legends-revealed-179/ "Comic Book Legends Revealed" #179, Comic Book Resources (Oct. 30, 2008).] Accessed Mar. 17, 2009.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
At the age of 10, the child who would grow up to become The Shroud saw his parents gunned down right before his eyes. He decided to dedicate his life to fighting crime. Upon graduation from college, he joined the mysterious temple called "Cult of Kali", where he studied various styles of martial arts. After seven years of intense training, he graduated from that temple. During the celebration ceremony, he was branded with the "Kiss of Kali," a red-hot iron. He had the image of the goddess Kali imprinted in livid scar tissue on his face from nose to hairline and from cheek to cheek. Following a period of intense pain and hospitalization, he realized that his eyesight had been replaced by a mystic extrasensory perception. Traveling back to the United States, he adopted the masked identity of the Shroud.<ref>origin revealed in ''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #7</ref>

His first appearance as a hero was in [[Latveria]], where he encountered the [[Human Torch]].<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #5</ref> He invaded Latveria, intending to kill [[Doctor Doom]] for his crimes against humanity. The Shroud recounted his origin to [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner, and the two secretly entered Latveria disguised as members of the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s [[Circus of Crime]]. The Shroud joined Prince Rudolfo's revolution against Doctor Doom, and came close to his revenge.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #6-10</ref> However, the Shroud shifted gears in order help Doom and [[Captain America]] oppose someone else with a longer track record of crimes against the humanity: the [[Red Skull]]. In outer space, The Shroud was shot by a ray built by the Red Skull while Doom battled the Skull on the moon. The Shroud was rescued by Captain America, while the Red Skull was left defeated on the moon (he was later rescued by Hitler himself, as the [[Hate Monger]]). Captain America brought Shroud back to Earth, but because of his time in space, Shroud became insane and it took him quite a while to recover.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #11-12</ref> After this recovery, Shroud discovered that he was able to tap into the [[Darkforce]] dimension.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The Shroud later recruits [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] to infiltrate a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility so that they can access the files. Alongside Spider-Woman, the Shroud battled the Cult of Kali.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #13-15</ref> The Shroud then took on Cat and Mouse as his aides.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #21</ref> He then teamed with [[Spider-Man]] against [[Dansen Macabre]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #94</ref> The Shroud aided the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]] against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]]. He helped restore the former Spider-Woman's astral self to her body.<ref>''Avengers'' #240-241</ref> He later refused [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'s offer to join the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> The Shroud assisted a depowered Jessica Drew against some crooks.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #67</ref> He assisted the West Coast Avengers against [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] and the [[Blank (comics)|Blank]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 1 #3-4</ref>

The Shroud went undercover in [[Los Angeles]] and operating as a crime-fighter masquerading as a criminal, he built a reputation as a criminal so he could destroy their world from within. This led him to create the group known as the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} With the Night Shift, he teamed with Captain America against the [[Power Broker]] and his augmented mutates.<ref>''Captain America'' #330-331</ref> He tested [[Moon Knight]] to take over as leader of the Night Shift.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #3</ref> He refused [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]'s offer to join the new [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #29</ref> He teamed with Hawkeye against the gang leader, Speedo.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #9</ref> Behind the scenes, Shroud made a deal with the [[West Coast Avengers]] not to interfere with his activities underground, but during a battle, Shroud went missing and the Night Shift battled the Avengers, causing a strain between the groups when the Shroud stopped the battle.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #40</ref> When Shroud returned to action, it was revealed that he had spent some time with his family, though no actual names of that family have ever been revealed.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Shroud made few appearances in the years following.

When the [[Superhero Registration Act]] was proposed by the United States during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Shroud refused to accept the proposal to give up his secret identity, and sided against heroes such as [[Ms. Marvel]] and [[Iron Man]]. He is also in a romantic relationship with [[Julia Carpenter]], the second [[Spider-Woman]], now known as Arachne. With Julia's help, Shroud managed to escape from [[Ryker's Island]], injuring a number of [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] agents in the process. The two of them planned to flee to [[Canada]] with Julia's daughter Rachel, but [[Wonder Man]] and Ms. Marvel captured the Shroud<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #7 (Marvel Comics, Nov. 2006).</ref> and Julia the following issue. He is then broken out<ref>''Civil War'' #6 (Marvel Comics, Dec. 2006).</ref> in order to join [[Captain America]]'s anti-registration army and takes part in the final battle.<ref>''Civil War'' #7 (Marvel Comics, Jan. 2007).</ref>

During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Shroud is paired with [[Silver Sable]], [[Misty Knight]], and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] when [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'s [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas target members of the mafia.<ref name="Shadowland: Blood on the Streets">''Shadowland - Blood on the Streets'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Exposure to bombardment of the [[Red Skull]]'s hypno-ray triggered a latent power over darkness in the Shroud. The Shroud possesses the mystical ability to create an aperture into Darkforce Dimension and to project the thick, inky gas-like substance of the Darkforce Dimension into Earth's dimension for his own use. This darkness is not simply the absence of light, but the negation of it. No illumination can penetrate it. It is unknown how much of this darkness the Shroud can summon at once.  He can blanket a small auditorium in darkness within several seconds. The darkness he projects does not fill a volume instantly: it is possible to see its hazy boundary move like thick, black smoke in the air. There appears to be no limit to the length of time the Shroud can maintain the darkness. However, loss of concentration can disrupt his power to summon and control darkness, and if the Shroud is rendered unconscious the darkness seems to be naturally drawn through the portal from whence it came.

The Shroud has control over the darkness so as to create hazy-edged, featureless black shapes with it, the complexity of which is limited only by his imagination. For example, he once created two tiny discs that covered Captain America's eyes to prevent Dansen Macabre from hypnotizing Captain America. These discs were so small that they were indistinguishable from the pupils of his eyes. He frequently forms the darkness into his own shadow in order to serve as a decoy. Unlike [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]]'s Darkforce, the darkness possesses no mass, and unlike [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], the Shroud is unable to travel into and out of the dimension from which he draws his darkness. He evntually learned to give his darkness enough mass to serve as a low-level thruster; together with the properties of his cape this allows him to fly at least at walking speed.<ref name="Shadowland: Blood on the Streets">''Shadowland - Blood on the Streets'' #1</ref>

The Shroud was blinded in a mystic ceremony by the Cult of Kali. As a result of this ceremony, he possesses a mystical sense of extrasensory perception enabling him to "see" through walls and even through his own mantle of darkness. This mystical sense gives him psychic impressions of his environment within a radius of about {{convert|100|ft|m}} of him. Not unlike [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], the Shroud can receive non-visual sensory impressions through solid objects.  Thus, he can perceive people and objects in the room next to him with the ease that he can perceive the contents of the room he is in. The Shroud notes in ''Spider-Woman'' I #15 that (unlike Daredevil) he cannot read, he apparently does not have that Max Carrados' style sensitivity of touch that enables Daredevil to read newsprint based on its feel compared to the rest of the page or its impression on the rest of the page. In that comic, [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] notes that though the Shroud's mystic senses enable him to detect what is inside a computer (its hardware components), the Shroud cannot read what is on the screen. 

The Shroud is an Olympic level athlete with extensive training in several fields of Oriental martial arts, and is adept at acrobatics and infiltration. He possesses a college degree in law and criminology. The Shroud carries explosive "bombarangs" as weapons, and flies in a personal one-man aircraft.

Ultimate Shroud is a superhero that debuts in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'' #1 as a supporting character. This character wears a red shroud, obscuring the face. Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] notes "We'll be teasing this person. You won't know if they're male or female but it is someone very famous and we'll be revealing their identity in the first arc... This Shroud is very different from the Marvel Universe one. Our Shroud is someone you've seen. They're a survivor of ''Ultimatum'' who for some reason feels they can't show their face anymore.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22502|title=Bendis Talks “Ultimate Comics Spider-Man”|last=Richards|first=David |date=2009-08-11|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> In issue six, the Shroud was revealed to be [[Alternate versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]].
