Dennis Golembuski was the grandson of a Polish freedom fighter who immigrated to America. Dennis may or may not have killed a man at the age of eight. He spent some time working as an underboss for [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], but quit. He began to work for a mysterious new master.

Later he had [[Mosh (comics)|Mosh]] brought to him for robbing a liquor store under his "protection". Mosh refused to hand over a percentage of his take from the robbery.

He recrutied the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] to help protect a batch of "bloodstones". After the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] arrived and stole half the diamonds, he gave Madam Rapier a list of pawn shops for them to scout, in case Hood tried to sell them. Hood arrived at the Golem's office and asking for a cut of the diamonds if he retruned the rest undamaged. Golem agreed but after the hood left, told Rapier to kill the thief at their rendezvous.

After the Hood double-crossed Rapier, knownig she planned to double-cross him, she was killed  in a hail of police gunfire. The Hood confronted Jack O'Lantern and the other super villians, he handed the diamonds over to them, teling them to tell Golem to just leave him alone. After they reported back to  him, he promised that nothing was ended between him and the Hood.
