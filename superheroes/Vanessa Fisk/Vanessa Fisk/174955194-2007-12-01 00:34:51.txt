'''Vanessa Fisk''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character. 

==Fictional character biography==
She is the wife of Wilson Fisk, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. She loves him deeply, but disagrees with his ways of crime. Vanessa recently split up with Wilson Fisk, although she returned to New York when she found out her son, [[Richard Fisk]] had tried to kill her husband. Furious, she killed Richard and took Kingpin away to recuperate. 

In the recent pages of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| Daredevil]]'', with Kingpin in prison, Vanessa was revealed as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| Daredevil]]'s mysterious manipulator since writer [[Ed Brubaker]] took over.  Slowly dying from the effects of killing her own son, Vanessa had constructed an elaborate revenge plot on Daredevil, who, along with Kingpin, she blamed for the death of Richard.  She offered to clear Matt Murdock of the allegations that he was Daredevil, as long as he would fight in court to free Kingpin, so the next life Kingpin ended would be upon Matt's head.  Daredevil declined the offer, but Vanessa had the [[FBI]] director who outed Matt killed, faking suicide with a note left confessing to framing Matt, and has already set the second stage of the plan in motion, the object of which is Daredevil's death.  

==Other versions==
=== Intercompany Crossovers ===
In ''Batman & Spider-Man #1'', Vanessa is infected with terminal cancer by [[Ra's Al Ghul]], who offers the Kingpin the cure for it in exchange for his help in a plot that will destroy New York. Disgruntled under Ra's, the Kingpin forms an alliance with Spider-Man and [[Batman]] and succeeds in defeating Ra's, only to be denied the cure for his wife's cancer by the beaten eco-terrorist. Vanessa is cured near the end of issue by Ra's Al Ghul's daughter [[Talia Al Ghul]], who recognizes Vanessa as a kindred spirit, as both of them loved a man that society would regard as a monster.

===Ultimate Universe===
Vanessa Fisk has had only a cameo in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', but she is nonetheless important to Kingpin's character.

The Kingpin sought the [[Tablet of Time]], but was stolen by the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], who wanted revenge on Fisk for putting her father in jail. She threw it in the water before being impaled by [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].

It was later revealed that Kingpin wanted the Tablet for his wife Vanessa, who was in a coma. Although he didn't believe in its alleged powers, she did, and he would do anything to wake her up.

Later, after Kingpin torched his law office, a crazed Daredevil broke into Fisk's home and threatened to murder the comatose Vanessa by snapping her neck, but was stopped by Spider-Man. Fisk ordered Vanessa to be taken out of the country before he was arrested himself over the attempted murder of Moon Knight.

==In other media==
Vanessa Fisk has appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', played by [[Caroline Goodall]].  In the series, she is one of the few characters who are aware that Wilson Fisk is the Kingpin. In the end of Ravages of Time, Vanessa decides to leave New York and Wilson for good, unable to deal with being the wife of a criminal.
