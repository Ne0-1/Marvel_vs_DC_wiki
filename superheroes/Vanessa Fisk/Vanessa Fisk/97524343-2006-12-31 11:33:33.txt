'''Vanessa Fisk''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character. 

==Character history==
She is the wife of [[Wilson Fisk]], the Kingpin. She loves him deeply, but disagrees with his ways of crime. Vanessa recently split up with Wilson Fisk, although she returned to New York when she found out her son had tried to kill her husband. Furious, she killed Richard and took Kingpin away to recuperate. 

In the recent pages of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| Daredevil]]'', with Kingpin in prison, Vanessa was revealed as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| Daredevil]]'s mysterious manipulator since writer [[Ed Brubaker]] took over.  Slowly dying from the effects of killing her own son, Vanessa had constructed an elaborate revenge plot on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| Daredevil]], who, along with [[Kingpin (comics)| Kingpin]], she blamed for the death of Richard.  She offered to clear Matt Murdock of the allegations that he was [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| Daredevil]], as long as he would fight in court to free [[Kingpin (comics)| Kingpin]], so the next life [[Kingpin (comics)| Kingpin]] ended would be upon Matt's head.  [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| Daredevil]] declined the offer, but Vanessa had the FBI director who outed Matt killed, faking suicide with a note left confessing to framing Matt, and has already set the second stage of the plan in motion, the object of which is [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)| DD]]'s death.  

===Ultimate Universe===
Vanessa Fisk has had only a cameo in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', but she is nonetheless important to Kingpin's character.

The Kingpin sought the [[Tablet of Time]], but was stolen by the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], who wanted revenge on Fisk for putting her father in jail. She threw it in the water before being killed by [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].

It was later revealed that Kingpin wanted the Tablet for his wife Vanessa, who was in a coma. Although he didn't believe in its alleged powers, she did, and he would do anything to wake her up.

== Other Media ==
Vanessa Fisk has appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', played by [[Caroline Goodall]].  In the series, she is one of the few characters who knew that Wilson Fisk is Kingpin.  In the end of Ravages of Time, Vanessa decided to leave New York forever, due to her husband's reputation as Kingpin.
