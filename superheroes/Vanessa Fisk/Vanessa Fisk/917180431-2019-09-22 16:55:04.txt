'''Vanessa Fisk''' ([[n√©e]] '''Mariana''')<ref name="Mariana" /> is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. As the wife of mobster the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin of Crime]] (Wilson Fisk) and the mother of [[Richard Fisk]], she appears as a supporting character in stories featuring those villains, usually those starring [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]].

Fisk has appeared in media adaptations, including the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] Netflix television series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' in which she was portrayed by [[Ayelet Zurer]] and in the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' in which she was voiced by [[Lake Bell]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], she first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #70 (March 1969).

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about Vanessa Fisk's personal life and early years other than her maiden name "Mariana", which was retroactively written into her backstory following the release of the Netflix show.<ref name="Mariana" /> As the wife of [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]], the "Kingpin" of New York's criminal underworld, Vanessa did not approve of her husband's criminal activities. At one point their son [[Richard Fisk]] became involved in a plot to overthrow his father's criminal syndicate after discovering he was the Kingpin.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

After the Kingpin had a near-death experience, Vanessa gave him an ultimatum; he had twenty-four hours to get out of crime, or she would leave him. The Kingpin was about to kill Spider-Man when the deadline passed, and Vanessa forced him to choose between Spider-Man's life or their life together. He chose his wife and spared Spider-Man as a result.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #197. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The two went into retirement in Japan. Kingpin prepared to settle his remaining business with his fellow mobsters by cooperating with the authorities and leaving the world of crime forever. This infuriated one of Kingpin's closest advisors, Lynch, who believed that Vanessa was a liability and had turned the once mighty Kingpin into a henpecked husband. When Fisk's former lieutenants in New York caught wind of his plans to sell them out in exchange for immunity, they kidnapped Vanessa, who was in town to secure the legal services of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]].<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #170. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fisk started a gang war against the mob in New York to rescue his wife. The mob bosses attempted to ransom Vanessa off in exchange for the evidence against them Fisk had intended to turn over to the authorities, but during the exchange, Kingpin used a sonic device to stop the criminals, and found her bound and gagged in a building. However Lynch fired an explosive at Vanessa, in an attempt to deprive Fisk of the thing that kept him retired and bring him back as the Kingpin of Crime. However, she was buried alive in the rubble and presumed dead, although she did not actually die.<ref>''Daredevil'' #171. Marvel Comics.</ref> As planned, this drove Kingpin back into the world of crime, although he found out Lynch was behind the explosion, partially due to a headache he gained, and took revenge by murdering his traitorous advisor. He then forced the remaining mob leaders to confess to hiring the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to kill several of Fisk's men.<ref>''Daredevil'' #172. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Weeks later, Matt Murdock's alter ego, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], found Vanessa in the sewers. Being buried alive had left Vanessa amnesiac and mentally unstable, and she ended up taken in by a grotesque mutant who lived in the sewers. Daredevil ultimately used her as leverage to force Kingpin to order his puppet Randolph Cherryh, newly elected to the office of Mayor, to resign and to confirm to the media that he was indeed a mob puppet. After reuniting with her, Kingpin had his now-catatonic wife shipped off to a sanitarium in Europe in order to have her regain her sanity. This would take years, as Vanessa's husband's organized crime empire would fall and be rebuilt during the period that Vanessa was institutionalized.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

Ultimately Vanessa would recover, and she would remain in Europe. But when her husband was the victim of an assassination attempt orchestrated by her son, Vanessa arranged for her husband to be shipped out of the country to recover from his injuries, and to cut a deal with his fellow mob bosses to divide up Fisk's recently rebuilt crime syndicate in exchange for a truce. Vanessa then took the final, brutal step of personally murdering her own devoted son, who admitted to Vanessa that his motivation was to rid the family of his father, who he blamed for his family's troubles.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

The act of murdering her own beloved son caused a horrific physical toll on Vanessa, causing her to slowly lose the will to live, which along with the injuries she sustained when she was buried alive, culminated in her body undergoing terminal organ failure. Blaming both her husband and Matt Murdock, who had recently been revealed to be Daredevil, for the endless cycle of violence that had consumed her family, Vanessa faked the death of Foggy Nelson in an attempt to provoke Murdock into killing Fisk while they were both in prison. When that failed, she manipulated the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] into posing as Daredevil, which ultimately drove Matt to break out of prison to find Foggy's murderer and the identity of the man impersonating him, culminating in her confronting Matt with an offer to clear his name in exchange for him clearing Kingpin, so that the two would be free to try and kill each other anew.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #92. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Though Daredevil refused this deal, Vanessa went ahead and arranged for the murder of Leland Drummond, the corrupt [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director who outed Matt in order to advance his own career within the FBI. To discredit his outing of Daredevil, the murder was made to look like a suicide and a false and highly damning suicide note was planted at the scene, claiming that Drummond took his own life after it became apparent that his scheme to frame Matt Murdock was about to be exposed. Shortly afterwards, Vanessa died and Murdock found himself morally guilted into serving as the Kingpin's lawyer, getting the charges dropped on the grounds that the evidence was too tainted to bring him to court. But Daredevil would exact his own form of a Faustian bargain with Kingpin, as he forced the crime boss to renounce his American citizenship and leave the country forever in exchange for his nemesis' legal services, stating that any attempt to continue their vendetta would be an insult to the memory of the good woman Vanessa had once been.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #93. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Wilson Fisk is later seen at her grave where he breaks down emotionally. She has since been talking to Wilson as a ghostly vision taunting him that he will never regain his former glory, an indication that her death still greatly affects him.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

The Arbiters bring Vanessa back as a [[revenant]] as a part of a test intended to gauge the Kingpin's worth as the head of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #7|date = 17 July 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Reluctant to combat his wife, Fisk tries to appeal to whatever humanity that she may still have left in her, and kills her when she still flings her weapons at him, unaware that she was actually aiming at the assassin who was approaching him from behind.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #8|date = 18 September 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

The [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] "reanimates" Vanessa in an attempt to coerce the Kingpin into allying with him in ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]''. The Kingpin responds by snapping Vanessa's neck while declaring, "That wasn't my wife. That was an abomination."<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Javier Garron|inker = Javier Garron|colorist = Frank D'Armata|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe|story = King's Ransom|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #19|date = 5 October 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

After Mayor Fisk starts planning to have Peter Parker killed, as he is the roommate of [[Boomerang (comics)|Fred Myers]], who is blackmailing him, a mysterious undead entity known only as [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kindred|Kindred]] appears in his cabinet. He kills Fisk's associates using supernatural abilities and forces him to back off Parker, after revealing he is in possession of Vanessa's soul.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #7.

** At the start of season 3, it's mentioned that the authorities are seeking Vanessa for questioning as an accessory to Fisk's crimes. Not wanting to be separated from her, Fisk agrees to be an informant for FBI Agent Rahul "Ray" Nadeem in exchange for Vanessa's continued protection, but it's all an act to manipulate Nadeem. In "One Last Shot," Vanessa returns from exile in Barcelona and is reunited with Fisk. She moves into his penthouse in the Presidential Hotel, is enamored by his new assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter]], and insists on being involved with Fisk's criminal lifestyle.

===Novel===
Vanessa Fisk appears in the novel ''Spider-Man: Forever Young'' written by Stefan Petrucha, a retelling of the Tablet storyline that introduced [[Silvermane]]. The novel also includes a follow-up story set a couple of years later, when Vanessa asks Spider-Man to help her retrieve the tablet from a restored Silvermane so that she can use it to cure her husband- currently in a trauma-induced coma- with Vanessa offering to use her resources to help the ill May Parker in the process (aware that Peter Parker and Spider-Man are connected without knowing that they are the same man). At the tale's conclusion, Vanessa abandons the idea of using the tablet after witnessing what it has done to Silvermane, who is left randomly aging through his use of the serum, but she nevertheless covers May's medical bills as agreed, leaving a message for Parker that he lived up to his end of their arrangement and she acknowledges that he is not at fault that the tablet has been confirmed to not be an option.
