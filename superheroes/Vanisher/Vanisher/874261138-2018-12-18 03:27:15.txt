==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], the Vanisher is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and a professional criminal with the ability to teleport to any place imaginable. He commits a series of spectacular crimes including; building a large criminal organization, stealing confidential defense plans from the [[United States]] government, and attempting to extort millions of dollars from the U.S. government. With support from a large group of non-mutant followers, he goes to the front lawn of the [[White House]] to await his payment. [[Professor X]]avier and the [[X-Men]] are able to intervene when Xavier induces [[amnesia]] upon the Vanisher. Forgetting he has mutant powers, the Vanisher is taken into police custody and the rest of the X-Men defeat the Vanisher's mob.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #2</ref>

The Vanisher eventually regains his memory and joins [[Factor Three]], a subversive organization of mutants who seek world domination. Factor Three attempts to start [[World War III]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Vanisher meets the X-Men again, however, this time, as allies. The [[Mutant Master]], leader of Factor Three, is revealed to be an alien of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#S|Siris]] race with a plan to conquer [[Earth]]. The rest of Factor Three, including the Vanisher, team up with the X-Men to defeat him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #37-39</ref> The Vanisher is later held prisoner by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], but is saved by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #60</ref>

The Vanisher disappears for a while, but eventually comes out of hiding to fight the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]]. To do so, he joins the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and uses reprogrammed Sentinels. He is defeated by the Champions and is trapped in mid-teleportation by [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]].<ref>''Champions'' #17</ref> The [[Darkforce]] strands half of him in another dimension, with the other half in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] where he is found by the X-Men.

After returning to Earth,<ref>''Bizarre Adventures'' #27</ref> the Vanisher organizes a group of young mutant thieves, known as the [[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]].

When the Sapien League starts abducting mutants and infecting them with a modified version of the Legacy Virus, the Vanisher teams up with Warpath.

Back in the present, the Vanisher's condition worsens. Needing help, he teleports to Utopia right in the middle of the battle between Selene's forces and the X-Men. He is rescued by Cyclops from an attack by [[Tarot (comics)|Tarot]] and ordered to take [[Emma Frost]] to safety. Before the Vanisher can react, they're attacked by Banshee. He then teleports off to the medical lab looking for Elixir.<ref>''X-Force'' vol.3 #21</ref> Upon finding Elixir in a coma, the Vanisher watches over him until Josh wakes up. He asks for the tumor to be removed only to be told to teleport X-Force to [[Genosha]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol.3 #22-23</ref> On Genosha, Elixir reveals he removed the tumor in the future and that the Vanisher is actually suffering from stage 4 Syphilis. Elixir tells him to leave because that's what he's good at and the Vanisher teleports into Selene's fortress to rescue Warpath. He engages in a battle with [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], who teleports his arm off before he teleports out. Rescuing the other members of X-Force and getting them to safety, he tells Elixir that Warpath was always nice to him and demands to be healed.<ref>''X-Force'' vol.3 #24</ref>

===Second Coming===
Upon [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] returning to the present, Cyclops orders Domino and the Vanisher to stand by in San Francisco.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #1</ref> Learning that Bastion was targeting teleporters to prevent the reunion of the so-called "Mutant Messiah" with the X-Men, Cyclops gives Domino instructions to bring the Vanisher back to Utopia. Hearing this, the Vanisher teleports to his hideout in [[Portugal]] only to find his girls dead and Steven Lang and his men awaiting him.

==Powers and abilities==
The Vanisher is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] that possesses the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] himself, his clothes, and an as yet undetermined amount of additional mass. Apparently, the Vanisher traverses the [[Darkforce]] Dimension when teleporting from one place on Earth to another. His power appears to be [[psionic]] in nature. The limits on the Vanisher's teleportation range and the maximum amount of mass he can teleport with himself are unknown, but he was able to teleport himself and several others from southern California to New York without any visible strain. The Vanisher has a subconscious [[extra-sensory perception|extrasensory]] ability that prevents him from materializing part or all of his body within a solid object, even if he has never before been to the area he is teleporting to. This allows the Vanisher to teleport with greater ease than Nightcrawler. His powers once interacted with those of Nightcrawler, sending them both into alternate dimensions.<ref>''[[Marvel Preview#Bizarre Adventures|Bizarre Adventures]]'' Vol 1 #27</ref>

The Vanisher has used guns which shoot gas or energy beams. He also once reprogrammed [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robots to do his bidding and can speak Portuguese fluently.
