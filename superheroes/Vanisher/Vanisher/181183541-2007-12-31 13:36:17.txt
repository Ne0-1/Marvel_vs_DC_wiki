The '''Vanisher''' ('''Telford Porter''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] of the [[Marvel Universe]], who is an opponent of the [[X-Men]]. He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''X-Men'' <!-- only denote volume number after first -->#2 (November 1963).

==Fictional character biography==
{{tense}}
[[Image:uncanny2.jpg|thumb|left|Vanisher's first appearance in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #2]]
A lot about the Vanisher's actual life remains unknown, except for his criminal career, though he was apparently born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. The Vanisher's criminal career became public when he crosses paths with the [[X-Men]] for the first time. The Vanisher uses his powers to steal top-secret defense plans and attempts to [[ransom]] off the plans for $10 million dollars. The Vanisher proceeds to teleport to the front lawn of the [[White House]] looking for his payment. [[Professor X]]avier and the X-Men are able to intervene, and Xavier induces [[amnesia]] upon the Vanisher. Afterwards, the Vanisher is taken into police custody.

The Vanisher eventually regains his memory and joins [[Factor Three]], a subversive organization of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who seek world domination. Factor Three is opposed by the X-Men when they attempt to start [[World War III]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Vanisher meets the X-Men again, but this time it was as allies. The Mutant Master, leader of Factor Three, is revealed to be an alien of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#S|Siris]] race. The Mutant Master's plan was to conquer [[Earth]]. The rest of the group, including the Vanisher, team up with the X-Men to defeat him.

The Vanisher disappears for a while. He comes out of hiding to fight the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]]. Now a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], he uses reprogrammed [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] against the Champions. He is defeated by them and was trapped in mid-teleportation by [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]]. He also joins a group of villains to challenge the Fantastic Four, but is defeated.

After traveling in another dimension with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], the Vanisher returns to Earth to lead a group of young mutant [[Theft|thieves]] known as the [[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]]. Eventually they disband, and the Vanisher was left to his own devices. 

The Vanisher keeps to himself for a long period of time, until he was mentally coerced by [[Asylum (comics)|Asylum]] to attack the [[New Warriors]] and other super heroes. Darkling, a [[superhuman]] who also uses energies from the Darkforce Dimension, is defeated and the Vanisher regains his free will. Later, the Vanisher joins a second incarnation of the Enforcers. The New Enforcers were a [[consortium]] that operates in obscurity. Along with [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] and a woman named Blitz, the Vanisher becomes involved in a clash between the criminal orginzations ''A.I.M.'' and ''Hyrdra''. They are confronted and defeated by [[Spider-Man]]<ref>''[[Web of Spiderman]]'' #99 - 100</ref>.

===X-Teams===

At some point, the Vanisher seeks to understand his powers in greater detail. He visits the Darkforce dimension but is captured by its inhabitants. They forced him to read them stories. He is rescued by [[X-Force]]'s [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], who had been manipulated into performing the mission. The Vanisher encounters X-Force on another occasion.

The Vanisher most recently resurfaces as a leader of a [[South America]]n [[drug cartel]] which was producing and distributing drugs that gave superhuman powers (possibly [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]]), throughout the [[Americas]]. [[Stacy X]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] were instrumental in stopping his [[North America]]n operations.

==Powers and abilities==
The Vanisher possesses the ability to [[teleport]] himself, his clothes, and an as yet undetermined amount of additional mass. Apparently the Vanisher traverses the [[Darkforce]] dimension when teleporting from one place on Earth to another. His power appears to be [[psionic]] in nature. The Vanisher's teleportational range and the maximum amount of mass he can teleport with himself are unknown, but he can teleport himself and several others from southern California to New York State without any visible strain. The Vanisher has a subconscious [[extra-sensory perception|extrasensory]] ability that prevents him from materializing part or all of his body within a solid object, even if he has never before been to the area he is teleporting to. This allows Vanisher to teleport with greater ease than Nightcrawler.  His powers once interacted with those of Nightcrawler, sending them both into alternate dimensions (''Nightcrawler'' limited series).

==Other versions==
===[[House of M]]===
Vanisher works with [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] and under the authority of [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] as part of the mutant supremacist rulership of Australia. They are opposed by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] who is mad that his native friends have been harassed. 

===Exiles Vanisher===
An altnerate reality Vanisher appeared in [[Exiles]] and demonstrated the ability to teleport from the Earth to a station in space.

===[[Ultimate Marvel]] Vanisher===
The Vanisher is a member of the Brotherhood terrorist cell raided by [[Captain America]] and the Ultimates in ''[[Ultimate War]]''.

==Other Media==
He has a brief cameo appearance in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. He is first seen during the meeting of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. During the attack on [[Alcatraz Island]], he is shown from behind disappearing with a puff of smoke and reappearing in a head-on view of the attacking mutants.
