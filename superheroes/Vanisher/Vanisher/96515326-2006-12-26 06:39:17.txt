The '''Vanisher (Telford Porter)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] of the [[Marvel Universe]], who is an opponent of the [[X-Men]]. He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''X-Men'' (first series)#2 (November 1963).

==Character biography==
[[image:uncanny2.jpg|thumb|left|Vanisher's first appearance in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #2]]
A lot about the Vanisher's actual life remains unknown, except for his criminal career. The beginning of the Vanisher's criminal career became public when he met paths with the [[X-Men]]. The Vanisher used his powers to steal top-secret defense plans and attempted to [[ransom]] off the plans for $10 million dollars. The Vanisher proceeded to teleport to the front lawn of the [[White House]] looking for his payment. [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]] and the X-Men was able to intervene by Xavier inducing [[amnesia]] upon the Vanisher. Afterwards, the Vanisher was taken into police custody.

The Vanisher eventually regained his memory and joined [[Factor Three]], a subversive organization of [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]] who sought world domination. Factor Three was opposed by the X-Men when they attempted to start [[World War III]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Vanisher met the X-Men again, but this time it was as alllies. The Mutant Master, leader of Factor Three, was revealed to be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. The Mutant Master's plan was to conquer [[Earth]]. The rest of the group, including the Vanisher, teamed up with the X-Men to defeat him.

The Vanisher disappeared for awhile. The Vanisher came out of hiding to fight the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]]. The Vanisher, now a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], used reprogrammed [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] against the Champions. He was defeated by them and was trapped in mid-teleportation by [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]]. 

After traveling in another dimension with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], the Vanisher returned to Earth to led a group of mutant [[Theft|thieves]] known as the Fallen Angels. Eventually the Fallen Angels disbanded and the Vanisher was left to his own devices. 

The Vanisher kept to himself for a long period of time, until he was mentally coerced by [[Asylum (comics)|Darkling]] to attack the [[New Warriors]] and other super heroes. Darkling, a [[superhuman]] who also used energies from the Darkforce Dimension, was defeated and the Vanisher regained his free will. Later, the Vanisher joined a second incarnation of the Enforcers. The New Enforcers were a [[consortium]] that operated in obscurity. They were defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and disbanded.

At some point the Vanisher sought to understand his powers in greater detail. He visited the Darkforce dimension but was captured by the inhabitants of the dimension. He was rescued by [[X-Force]]'s [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. The Vanisher encountered X-Force on another occasion.

The Vanisher most recently resurfaced as a leader of a [[South America]]n [[drug cartel]]. This drug cartel was producing and distributing drugs that gave superhuman powers (possibly being [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]]), throughout the [[Americas]]. [[Stacy X]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] were instrumental in stopping his [[North America]]n operations.

==Powers and abilities==
The Vanisher possesses the ability to [[teleport]] himself, his clothes, and an as yet undetermined amount of additional mass. Apparently the Vanisher traverses the [[Darkforce]] dimension when teleporting from one place on Earth to another. His power appears to be [[psionic]] in nature. The Vanisher's teleportational range and the maximum amount of mass he can teleport with himself are unknown, but he can teleport himself and several others from southern California to New York State without any visible strain. The Vanisher has a subconscious [[extra-sensory perception|extrasensory]] ability that prevents him from materializing part or all of his body within a solid object, even if he has never before been to the area he is teleporting to.
