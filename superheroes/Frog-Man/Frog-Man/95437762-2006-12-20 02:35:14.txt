'''Frog-Man''' ('''Eugene Patilio''') is a minor comedic [[superhero]] created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Kerry Gammill]] for [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #131 (July [[1983]])

==Fictional character biography==
'''The Fabulous Frog-Man''' was the son of the minor [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] supervillain '''[[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]] (Vincent Patilio)'''. After several defeats by Daredevil, [[Iron Man]], and [[Spider-Man]], which eventually landed him in jail, Vincent had decided to retire and go straight. 

His son, Eugene, donned his father's costume in an attempt to be a crimefighter to clear his father's name. However, his crimefighting career became essentially a joke. His two major enemy villains are the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], a villainess who resembled a [[Playboy Bunny]], and the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]], a dimwitted character who essentially had the proportionate abilities of a walrus (tough skin and super-strength, though well below Spider-Man's class).

Frog-Man had a tendency to capture villains simply by dumb luck. Eugene's inability to fully pilot his automated Frog-Man costume caused him to wildly bounce around, scoring sure wins against villains by crashing into them. This questionable method accounts for his victories over [[Yellow Claw]] and [[Speed Demon]].  Both villains were later contacted by the White Rabbit with proposals for an alliance against him. She later complained to Walrus that both men laughed her off as soon as they heard her codename. 

He also participated, along with [[Steel Spider|Spider-kid]] and [[Toad (comics)|The Toad]], in a short-lived super-team called the Misfits.

Vincent Patilio was very proud of his son, yet at the same time, very worried about him risking his life. He even prevented his son from joining the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Considering his son's luck, Vincent shouldn't have to worry too much about anything too bad.
