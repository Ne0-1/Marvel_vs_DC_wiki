'''Frog-Man''' ('''Eugene Patilio''') is a minor comedic [[superhero]] created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Kerry Gammill]] for [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #121.

==Fictional character biography==
Eugene Patilio was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Vincent Patilio (the minor [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] supervillain '''[[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]]'''). After several defeats by Daredevil, [[Iron Man]], and [[Spider-Man]], which eventually landed him in jail, Vincent eventually decided to retire and go straight.

His son Eugene donned his father's costume as the '''Fabulous Frog-Man''' in an attempt to be a crime-fighter.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #131 (July 1983)</ref> However, his crime-fighting career became essentially a joke. His two major enemy villains are the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], a comedic villainess inspired by the ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' character,<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #131 (July 1983)</ref> and the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]], a dimwitted character who essentially had the proportionate abilities of a walrus (tough skin and super-strength, though well below Spider-Man's class).<ref>''New Defenders'' #131 (May 1984); ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #185 (February 1992)</ref>

Frog-Man had a tendency to capture villains simply by dumb luck. Eugene's inability to fully pilot his automated Frog-Man costume caused him to wildly bounce around, scoring sure wins against villains by crashing into them. This questionable method of fighting supervillains accounts for his luck in dealing with the [[Yellow Claw]],<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #31 & #32 (March & May 1987)</ref> and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #121 (September 1982)</ref> ([[Captain America]] assisted in the battle against the Claw). Both villains were later contacted by the White Rabbit with proposals for an alliance against him. She later complained to Walrus that both men laughed her off as soon as they heard her codename. When Rabbit and Walrus went on a rampage shortly after that revelation, they not only lured Eugene to them, as the Rabbit had hoped, but also his father and Spider-Man (who was visiting the Patilios) and suffered another crushing defeat, with Eugene clumsily bouncing into the Rabbit once again.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #185 (February 1992)</ref>

He also participated, along with [[Steel Spider|Spider-Kid]] and [[Toad (comics)|The Toad]], in a short-lived super-team called the Misfits.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #266 (July 1985)</ref>

Vincent Patilio was very proud of his son, yet at the same time very worried about him risking his life. He even prevented his son from joining the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], even when it meant publicly humiliating him by literally dragging him home in front of the team and the media.<ref>''New Defenders'' #131 (May 1984)</ref>

When [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]], the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]], began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Frog-Man was amongst his captives.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #15 (2008)</ref>

Eugene Patilio was later recruited by the US government as part of the Fifty-State-[[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, as a member of the [[Kentucky]] based team, [[Action Pack (comics)|Action Pack]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7</ref> During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, he was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref>

After the invasion is over, the real Frog-Man is shown in a [[support group]] meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Frog-Man appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> He is part of [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]'s team and helps battle [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]].<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Frog-Man witnesses terrorists with spider powers attacking the [[United Nations]] and springs into action, teaming up with [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Jessica Jones]] against a spider-empowered [[Flag-Smasher]]. After the battle, Frog-Man gains the grudging respect of Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Jessica Jones.<ref>''Spider-Island: Avengers'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Frog-Man has no superpowers, but wears a frog suit that contains electrical coils on the soles of its flippers which allows him to leap great distances. The boots' power source is worn on his back like a back pack. Additionally, the suit has an internal padding which enables Frog-Man to bounce off objects with little danger.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Frog-Man made a brief appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' episode "The Cure." After the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] was "cured" of his condition, he was a potential recruit as a new member of the Fantastic Four. Frog-Man was rejected after accidentally bashing his own head off the ceiling during his audition for the team.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Cure | episodelink = The Cure (Fantastic Four) | series = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | serieslink = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | airdate = 2007-06-09 | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref>
