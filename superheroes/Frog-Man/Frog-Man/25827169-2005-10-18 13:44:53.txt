'''Frog-Man'''('''Eugene Patilio''') is a minor comedic [[superhero]] created by [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #121 ([[September]] [[1982]])

The Fabulous Frog-Man was the son of the minor [[Daredevil]] supervillain [[Leap-Frog]], real name Vincent Patilio. After several defeats by Daredevil, Iron Man, and Spider-Man, which eventually landed him in jail, Vincent had decided to retire and go straight. 

Eugene, his son, donned his father's costume in an attempt to be a crimefighter t clear his father's name. However, his crimefighting career became essentially a joke. His two major villains were the White Rabbit, a villainess who resembled a Playboy Bunny, and the Walrus, a dimwitted character who essentially had the proportionate abilities of a walrus (Which made him actually weaker)! Also, Frog-Man's tendency to beten caused him to capture villains simply by dumb luck (Eugene's inability to fully pilot his automated Frog-Man costume caused him to wildly bounce around, scoring sure wins against villains by crashing into them!).

Vincent Patilio was very proud of his son, yet at the same time, very wrried about him risking his life. Considering his son's luck, Vincent shouldn't have to worry tto much about anything too bad
