'''Frog-Man''' ('''Eugene Patilio''') is a fictional comedic [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Frog-Man's first appearance was in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #121 (September 1982).<ref name="back44"/> The character was created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]], who later said he was one of his "all-time favorite" characters.<ref name="back44">{{cite journal|last= Miller|first= Jonathan|date= October 2010|title= Spider-Man and Company: The Wide World of Marvel Team-Up|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 39|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|quote=Created by J. M. DeMatteis in a story illustrated by [[Kerry Gammill]], Frog-Man was the teenage son of an obscure supervillain, intent on making a name for himself as a superhero and restoring his family's good name in the process.}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Eugene Patilio was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Vincent Patilio (the supervillain '''[[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]]'''). After several defeats by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Spider-Man]], which eventually landed him in jail, Vincent eventually decided to retire and go straight.

His son Eugene donned his father's costume as the '''Fabulous Frog-Man''' in an attempt to be a crime-fighter.<ref name="Marvel Team-Up' 1983">''Marvel Team-Up'' #131 (July 1983)</ref> However, his crime-fighting career became essentially a joke. His two major enemy villains are the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], a comedic villainess inspired by the ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' character,<ref name="Marvel Team-Up' 1983"/> and the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]], a dimwitted character who essentially had the proportionate abilities of a walrus (tough skin and super-strength).<ref>''New Defenders'' #131 (May 1984); ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #185 (February 1992)</ref>

Frog-Man had a tendency to capture villains simply by dumb luck. Eugene's inability to fully pilot his automated Frog-Man costume caused him to wildly bounce around, scoring wins against villains by crashing into them. This questionable method of fighting supervillains accounts for his luck in dealing with the [[Yellow Claw]],<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #31 & #32 (March & May 1987)</ref> and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #121 (September 1982)</ref> ([[Captain America]] assisted in the battle against the Claw). The White Rabbit and Walrus later teamed up to get revenge on Frog-Man and went on a rampage in the city. They not only lured Eugene to them, as the Rabbit had hoped, but also his father and Spider-Man (who was visiting the Patilios) and suffered another crushing defeat, with Eugene clumsily bouncing into the Rabbit once again.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #185 (February 1992)</ref>

He also participated, along with [[Steel Spider|Spider-Kid]] and [[Toad (comics)|The Toad]], in a short-lived super-team called the Misfits.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #266 (July 1985)</ref>

Vincent Patilio was very proud of his son, yet at the same time very worried about him risking his life. He even prevented his son from joining the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], even when it meant publicly humiliating him by dragging him home in front of the team and the media.<ref>''New Defenders'' #131 (May 1984)</ref>

When [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kraven]], the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]], began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Frog-Man was amongst his captives.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #15 (2008)</ref>

Eugene Patilio was later recruited by the US government as part of the Fifty-State-[[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, as a member of the [[Kentucky]] based team, [[Action Pack (comics)|Action Pack]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, he was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref> After the invasion is over, the real Frog-Man is shown in a [[support group]] meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Frog-Man appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> He is part of [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]'s team and helps battle [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]].<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #2</ref> He is later seen with the team during a massive earthquake caused by a battle between Gravity and [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] and helps them in their fight against [[Thor Girl]], who had recovered her designate powers.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #5-6</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Frog-Man witnesses terrorists with spider powers attacking the [[United Nations]] and springs into action, teaming up with [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Jessica Jones]] against a spider-empowered [[Flag-Smasher]]. After the battle, Frog-Man gains the grudging respect of Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, and Jessica Jones.<ref>''Spider-Island: Avengers'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Frog-Man has no superpowers, but wears a frog suit that contains electrical coils on the soles of its flippers which allows him to leap great distances. The boots' power source is worn on his back like a back pack. Additionally, the suit has an internal padding which enables Frog-Man to bounce off objects with little danger.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Frog-Man made a brief appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' episode "The Cure." After the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] was "cured" of his condition, he was a potential recruit as a new member of the Fantastic Four alongside [[Captain Ultra]], [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Squirrel Girl]], and [[Texas Twister]]. Frog-Man was rejected after accidentally bashing his own head on the ceiling during his audition for the team.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Cure | episodelink = The Cure (Fantastic Four) | series = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | serieslink = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | airdate = 2007-06-09 | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref>
