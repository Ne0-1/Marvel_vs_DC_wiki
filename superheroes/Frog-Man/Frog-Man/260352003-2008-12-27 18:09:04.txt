'''Frog-Man''' ('''Eugene Patilio''') is a minor comedic [[superhero]] created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Kerry Gammill]] for [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #131.

== Fictional character biography ==
Eugene Patillo was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Vincent Patillo]], the minor [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] supervillain '''Leap-Frog'''. After several defeats by Daredevil, [[Iron Man]], and [[Spider-Man]], which eventually landed him in jail, Vincent had decided to retire and go straight. 

His son, Eugene, donned his father's costume as '''Fabulous Frog-Man''' in an attempt to be a crime-fighter to clear his father's name. However, his crime-fighting career became essentially a joke. His two major enemy villains are the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], a villainess inspired by the ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' character, and the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]], a dimwitted character who essentially had the proportionate abilities of a walrus (tough skin and super-strength, though well below Spider-Man's class).

Frog-Man had a tendency to capture villains simply by dumb luck. Eugene's inability to fully pilot his automated Frog-Man costume caused him to wildly bounce around, scoring sure wins against villains by crashing into them. This questionable method of fighting supervillains accounts for his luck in dealing with the [[Yellow Claw]] and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]]. (It should be noted that [[Captain America]] assisted in the battle against the Claw.) Both villains were later contacted by the White Rabbit with proposals for an alliance against him. She later complained to Walrus that both men laughed her off as soon as they heard her codename. 

He also participated, along with [[Steel Spider|Spider-Kid]] and [[Toad (comics)|The Toad]], in a short-lived super-team called the [[Misfits (comics)|Misfits]].

Vincent Patilio was very proud of his son, yet at the same time very worried about him risking his life. He even prevented his son from joining the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Considering his son's luck, Vincent shouldn't have to worry too much about anything too bad.

=== The Initiative ===
Eugene Patilio's '''Frog-Man''' was later recruited by the government as part of the Fifty-State-[[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, as a member of the [[Kentucky]] based team, [[Action Pack]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7</ref> In [[Secret Invasion]] he was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Frog-Man's suit contains electrical coils on the soles of its flippers which allows him to leap great distances. The boots' power source is worn on his back like a back pack. In addition, internal padding of the suit enables Frog-man to bounce off objects with little danger.

==Other media==
===Television===
* Frog-Man made a brief  appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' episode "The Cure", where, after the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] was "cured" of his condition, he was a potential recruit as a new member of the Fantastic Four; Frog-Man was rejected after accidentally bashing his own head off the ceiling during his audition for the team.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Cure | episodelink = The Cure (Fantastic Four) | series = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | serieslink = Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes | airdate = 2007-06-09 | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref>
