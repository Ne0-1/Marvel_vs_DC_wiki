'''Weather Wizard''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]. The Weather Wizard first appeared in ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' <!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> #110 (December [[1959]]-January [[1960]]).

==Fictional Character Biography==
Escaping a prison transport, '''Mark Mardon''' fled to his brother's house only to find him dead. Mardon's brother, Clyde, a scientist, had just discovered a way to [[weather control|control the weather]] before dying of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] (although recent evidence implies that Mardon murdered his brother and either lied about or blocked out the memory of finding his body). Mardon took Clyde's notes and used them to make a wand to generate [[weather]] and embarked on a criminal career as The Weather Wizard, sometimes using his powers on a small scale (such as zapping someone with [[lightning]]) and sometimes a larger scale (imprisoning a town in winter), almost always facing defeat by The Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]).

After Barry Allen's death during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', The Weather Wizard went into semi-retirement for a while, until, during ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', he teamed up with other [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues]] which included [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Captain Boomerang#Digger Harkness|Captain Boomerang]], and [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], as part of a ploy for greater power. Ultimately, it ended with their deaths and the release of the demon [[Neron]]. They were later resurrected as soulless demons, by Neron to use against Barry Allen's successor [[Wally West]], who manipulated Neron to return the Rogue's souls. The Weather Wizard and the others, save Heat Wave, returned to a life of crime. 

Weather Wizard joined up with [[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]] and her rogues. Through her, he learns he has a son from a one night stand with [[Keystone City]] police officer Julie Jackham. Their son, Josh, had exhibited internalized weather-controlling abilities and Mardon wanted to have the same ability without the use of his wand. He tried to kidnap Josh from Wally's wife, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda]] and dissect him to understand out how his son gained that ability, but hesitated to harm the child when he notice that the child had "''my eyes...my brother's eyes.''" He was stopped by Flash and sent to [[Iron Heights]], but escaped. After Blacksmith's group disbanded, the Weather Wizard, along with Mirror Master and [[Trickster (comics)#Axel Walker|Trickster]], joined up with Captain Cold, who declared himself the leader of the Rogues. Mardon was also the representative of the rogues for the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

[[One Year Later]], he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]). Inertia destroyed Weather Wizard's wand and used 30th century psychological therapies to remove the mental blocks which prevented him from using his powers without it. Though Inertia is eventually defeated, the other Rogues successfully beat Bart to death, Weather Wizard using his control over lightning to electrocute him. After Allen's identity was revealed, Mardon was surprised and horrified to discover that the Rogues had "''killed a kid''" (''All Flash'' #1).

Weather Wizard is also one of the exiled villains featured in [[Salvation Run]].

He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined the [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In "''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]''" #1, however, Weather Wizard and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game (Captain Cold even berates [[Mirror Master]] for working with scum like Dr. Light). Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used. In #3, Libra kidnaps Josh and tries to get him to join the Society, threatening to kill the boy if he doesn't. Mardon says that if he was capable of killing his own brother, there's no way he wouldn't kill his son. Inertia then kills the boy himself, and Mardon joins his fellow Rogues in defeating and killing Inertia.

==Powers and Abilities==
Weather Wizard originally wielded a wand that enabled him to control the [[weather]]. Recently [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] destroyed his wand, using 30th Century psychological therapies to remove Weather Wizard's mental blocks. He can now control the weather without his wand.

==Other Versions==
A version of Weather Wizard exists on [[Earth-33]], a world of magicians.

Also in that episode, Mark's brother (here called Ben) wasn't dead and Mark siphoned the energy off Superman and Flash through the monitoring arm bands. With Ben's help, Superman and The Flash defeated him. He was voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]].
