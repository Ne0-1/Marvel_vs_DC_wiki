'''Weather Wizard''' is the name of a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]. The Weather Wizard first appeared in ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (1st series) #110 (December [[1959]]-January [[1960]]).

==Character history==
Escaping a prison transport, '''Mark Mardon''' fled to his brother's house only to find him dead. Mardon's brother, Clyde, a scientist, had just discovered a way to [[weather control|control the weather]] before dying of a [[heart attack]] (although recent evidence implies that Mardon murdered his brother and either lied about or blocked out the memory of finding his body). Mardon took Clyde's notes and used them to make a wand to generate [[weather]] and embarked on a criminal career as The Weather Wizard, sometimes using his powers on a small scale (such as zapping someone with [[lightning]]) and sometimes a larger scale (imprisoning a town in winter), almost always facing defeat by The Flash ([[Barry Allen]]).

After Barry Allen's death during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', The Weather Wizard went into semi-retirement for a while, until, during ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', he teamed up with other [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues]] which included [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Captain Boomerang]] I, and [[Mirror Master]] II, as part of a ploy for greater power. Ultimately, it ended with their deaths and the release of the demon [[Neron]]. They were later resurrected as soulless demons, by Neron to use against Barry Allen's successor [[Wally West]], who manipulated Neron to return the Rogue's souls. The Weather Wizard and the others, save Heat Wave, returned to a life of crime. 

Weather Wizard joined up with [[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]] and her rogues. Through her, he learns he has a son from a one night stand with [[Keystone City]] police officer Julie Jackham. Their son, Josh, had exhibited internalized weather-controlling abilities and Mardon wanted to have the same ability without the use of his wand. He tried to kidnap Josh from Wally's wife, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda]] and dissect him to understand out how his son gained that ability. He was stopped by Flash and sent to [[Iron Heights]], but escaped. After Blacksmith's group disbanded, the Weather Wizard, along with Mirror Master and [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster II]], joined up with Captain Cold, who declared himself the leader of the Rogues. Mardon was also the representative of the rogues for the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

Weather Wizard was introduced in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode titled "Speed Demons," where Superman and the Flash competed for the title of 'fastest man alive'. Also in that episode, Mark's brother Clyde wasn't dead and Mark siphoned the energy off of Superman and Flash through the monitoring arm bands. With Clyde's help, Superman and The Flash defeated him. He was played by [[Miguel Ferrer]].

In [[Hereafter (Justice League episode)|an episode]] of ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', Weather Wizard was a member of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]] and was defeated. He was played by [[Corey Burton]].

In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Weather Wizard appears as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom]]. He was also seen as a background character and a display in the "Flash and Substance" episode.
