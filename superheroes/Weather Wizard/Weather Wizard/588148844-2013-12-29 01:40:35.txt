==Fictional character biography==
=== Early life ===
Escaping a prison transport by leaping from the window, '''Mark Mardon''' fled to his brother's house only to find him dead. Mardon's brother, Clyde, a scientist, had just discovered a way to [[weather control|control the weather]] before dying of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] (although recent evidence implies that Mardon murdered his brother and either lied about or blocked out the memory of finding his body<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge'' #2</ref>). Mardon took Clyde's notes and used them to make a wand to generate [[weather]] and embarked on a criminal career as The Weather Wizard, sometimes using his powers on a small scale (such as zapping someone with [[lightning]]) and sometimes a larger scale (imprisoning a town in winter), almost always facing defeat by The Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]). In his first appearance he tried to get revenge on the [[policemen]] who imprisoned him, allowing the Flash to predict his target and defeat him.

After Barry Allen's death during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', The Weather Wizard went into semi-retirement for a while, until, during ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', he teamed up with other [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues]] which included [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Captain Boomerang#Digger Harkness|Captain Boomerang]], and [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], as part of a ploy for greater power. Ultimately, it ended with their deaths and the release of the demon [[Neron]]. They were later resurrected as soulless demons, by Neron to use against Barry Allen's successor [[Wally West]], who manipulated Neron to return the Rogues' souls. The Weather Wizard and the others, save Heat Wave, returned to a life of crime. 

Weather Wizard joined up with [[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]] and her rogues. Through her, he learns he has a son from a one night stand with [[Keystone City]] police officer Julie Jackham. Their son, Josh, had exhibited internalized weather-controlling abilities and Mardon wanted to have the same ability without the use of his wand. He tried to kidnap Josh from Wally's wife, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda]] and dissect him to understand out how his son gained that ability, but hesitated to harm the child when he noticed that the child had "''my eyes...my brother's eyes.''" He was stopped by Flash and sent to [[Iron Heights]], but escaped. After Blacksmith's group disbanded, the Weather Wizard, along with Mirror Master and [[Trickster (comics)#Axel Walker|Trickster]], joined up with Captain Cold, who declared himself the leader of the Rogues. Mardon was also the representative of the rogues for the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

=== One Year Later ===
[[One Year Later]], he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]). Inertia destroyed Weather Wizard's wand and used 30th century psychological therapies to remove the mental blocks which prevented him from using his powers without it. Though Inertia is eventually defeated, the other Rogues beat Bart to death, Weather Wizard using his control over lightning to electrocute him. After Allen's identity was revealed, Mardon was surprised and horrified to discover that the Rogues had "''killed a kid''".<ref>''All Flash'' #1</ref>

=== Salvation Run ===
Weather Wizard is one of the exiled villains featured in [[Salvation Run]] along with his fellow Rogues: [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].

=== Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge ===
He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined the [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In "''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]''" series, however, Weather Wizard and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game (Captain Cold even berates [[Mirror Master]] for working with scum like Dr. Light). Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge'' #1</ref> In retalliation, Libra kidnaps Josh and tries to get Mardon to join the Society, threatening to kill the boy if he does not. To which Mardon responds ''"If I killed my brother, Libra, if I electrocuted the only person who ever cared about me, what makes you think I care '''anything''' about that child?"'' Libra then taunts Mardon to prove him wrong. Mardon is hesitant to make a move when Inertia kills the boy himself, and Mardon joins his fellow Rogues in defeating and killing Inertia.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge'' #3</ref>

===The New 52===
In this timeline of [[The New 52]], while Weather Wizard's past with Barry Allen remains almost unchanged, his origins are slightly different. Now called '''Marco Mardon''' he and his brother, Claudio, are Latino and the heads of a [[Mafia]] family. After their father's death Marco runs away, eventually becoming the Weather Wizard, but is called back after Claudio's murder. The Flash, looking for [[Patty Spivot]] who had been kidnapped, later attacks and submits Mardon forcing Elsa, his brother's widow, to reveal she as the kidnapper and also Claudio's killer. This revelation drives Marco to the edge, making him attempt a suicide-murder by calling lightning to strike himself and Elsa; however, he survives and is approached by the [[Golden Glider]] for an unknown plot.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #10 (June 2012)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Weather Wizard originally wielded a wand that enabled him to control [[weather]] patterns. Weather Wizard has used it to produce blizzards, summon lightning bolts, fly using air currents, produce fog and generate winds. Essentially Weather Wizard can produce any type of weather pattern imaginable, as well as other phenomenon such as tornadoes. Recently [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] destroyed his wand, using 30th Century psychological therapies to remove Weather Wizard's mental blocks. He can now control the weather without his wand. Weather Wizard has also shown limited control over magnetism.

In The New 52 reality Marddon returns to using his wand, but reveals that the device drove him crazy.
