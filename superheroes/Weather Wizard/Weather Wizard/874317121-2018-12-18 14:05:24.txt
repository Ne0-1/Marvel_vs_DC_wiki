==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Escaping a prison transport by leaping from the window, '''Mark Mardon''' fled to his brother's house only to find him dead. Mardon's brother, Clyde, a scientist, had just discovered a way to [[weather control|control the weather]] before dying of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] (although recent evidence implies that Mardon murdered his brother and either lied about or blocked out the memory of finding his body<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge'' #2</ref>). Mardon took Clyde's notes and used them to make a wand to generate [[weather]] and embarked on a criminal career as The Weather Wizard, sometimes using his powers on a small scale (such as zapping someone with [[lightning]]) and sometimes a larger scale (imprisoning a town in winter), almost always facing defeat by The Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]).

After Barry Allen's death during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', The Weather Wizard went into semi-retirement for a while, until, during ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', he teamed up with other [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues]] which included [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Captain Boomerang#Digger Harkness|Captain Boomerang]], and [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], as part of a ploy for greater power. Ultimately, it ended with their deaths and the release of the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. They were later resurrected as soulless demons by Neron to use against Barry Allen's successor [[Wally West]], who manipulated Neron to return the Rogues' souls. The Weather Wizard and the others, except for Heat Wave, returned to a life of crime.

Weather Wizard joined up with [[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]] and her rogues. Through her, he learns he has a son from a one-night stand with [[Keystone City]] police officer Julie Jackham. Their son, Josh, had exhibited internalized weather-controlling abilities and Mardon wanted to have the same ability without the use of his wand. He tried to kidnap Josh from Wally's wife, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda]] and dissect him to understand out how his son gained that ability, but hesitated to harm the child when he noticed that the child had "''my eyes...my brother's eyes.''" He was stopped by Flash and sent to [[Iron Heights]], but escaped. After Blacksmith's group disbanded, the Weather Wizard, along with Mirror Master and [[Trickster (comics)#Axel Walker|Trickster]], joined up with Captain Cold, who declared himself the leader of the Rogues. Mardon was also the representative of the rogues for the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later]], he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]). Inertia destroyed Weather Wizard's wand and used 30th century psychological therapies to remove the mental blocks which prevented him from using his powers without it. Though Inertia is eventually defeated, the other Rogues beat Bart to death, Weather Wizard using his control over lightning to electrocute him. After Allen's identity was revealed, Mardon was surprised and horrified to discover that the Rogues had "''killed a kid''".<ref>''All Flash'' #1</ref>

===Salvation Run===
Weather Wizard is one of the exiled villains featured in [[Salvation Run]] along with his fellow Rogues: [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].

===Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge===
He was seen as the member of Rogues who joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In the ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' series, however, Weather Wizard and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game (Captain Cold even berates [[Mirror Master]] for working with scum like Dr. Light). Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge'' #1</ref> In retaliation, Libra kidnaps Josh and tries to get Mardon to join the Society, threatening to kill the boy if he does not. To which Mardon responds ''"If I killed my brother, Libra, if I electrocuted the only person who ever cared about me, what makes you think I care '''anything''' about that child?"'' Libra then taunts Mardon to prove him wrong. Mardon is hesitant to make a move when Inertia kills the boy himself, and Mardon joins his fellow Rogues in defeating and killing Inertia.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogue's Revenge'' #3</ref>

After their father's death Marco runs away, eventually becoming the Weather Wizard, but is called back after Claudio's murder. The Flash, looking for [[Patty Spivot]] who had been kidnapped, later attacks and submits Mardon forcing Elsa, his brother's widow, to reveal she as the kidnapper and also Claudio's killer. This revelation drives Marco to the edge, making him attempt a suicide-murder by calling lightning to strike himself and Elsa; however, he survives and is approached by the [[Golden Glider]] for an unknown plot.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #10 (June 2012)</ref>

In the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Weather Wizard and his fellow Rogues are among the villain that attend the underground meeting held by [[Riddler]] that talks about the Superman Theory.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Weather Wizard originally wielded a wand that enabled him to control [[weather]] patterns. Weather Wizard has used it to produce blizzards, summon lightning bolts, fly using air currents, produce fog and generate winds. Essentially Weather Wizard can produce any type of weather pattern imaginable, as well as other phenomenon such as tornadoes. Recently [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] destroyed his wand, using 30th Century psychological therapies to remove Weather Wizard's mental blocks. He can now control the weather without his wand. Weather Wizard has also shown limited control over magnetism.

In The New 52 reality, Mardon returns to using his wand, but reveals that the device drove him crazy.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Live-action====
* In the 1979 TV specials ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'', Weather Wizard was portrayed by comedian [[Jeff Altman]].
* [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul DeMeo]] tried to do Weather Wizard for the first season of the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 Flash TV series]], but didn’t have enough money to do so and they had to wait until they had a larger budget. Ultimately, it failed to materialise after the show was canceled.<ref>{{cite comic|story=Behind the Scenes with the Flash|title=The Flash TV Special|issue=1|date=1991}}</ref>

* Chad Rook and [[Liam McIntyre]] portray Clyde and Mark Mardon, respectively, on [[The CW]]'s ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/310791-recap-of-dc-entertainment-night-featuring-arrow-the-flash-and-constantine|title=Comic-Con: Recap of DC Entertainment Night Featuring Arrow, The Flash and Constantine|publisher=Superhero Hype |date=2014-07-27|accessdate=2014-07-27|first=Joshua|last=Starnes}}</ref> In the series [[television pilot|pilot]], the brothers are bank robbers that are caught in a plane crash when the [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] particle accelerator explodes, giving them both the ability to manipulate the weather. However, Mark was heavily wounded in the aftermath of their transformation and was hospitalized as his younger brother returns to Central City nine months later. Clyde used his powers to terrorize Central City for a short period of time, and was the first metahuman the Flash fought. After getting his plan foiled by the Flash, Clyde is shot dead by Detective [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]], saving the Flash's life. After learning that Clyde was shot dead by Joe while fighting [[The Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], having fully mastered his powers behind-the-scenes by the events of "Out of Time" – to the extent that he can control the weather in a precise manner inside a building where his brother could only control it on a large scale outside – Mark decides to avenge his brother by kidnapping Joe with the intent of having the detective watch him kill everyone in Central City. He generates an enormous tidal wave, causing Barry to use his speed to create a barrier against it, but Barry inadvertently travels back in time a day before as the result. He captures Mark before he can initiate his revenge against Joe, and Mark becomes one of S.T.A.R. Labs' prisoners. In the episode "Rogue Air", he is being transported to Lian Yu, with the other metahumans, who had been imprisoned in S.T.A.R Labs, but Captain Cold sabotaged the plan and set them free, also offering him and [[Rainbow Raider]] the chance to join the [[Rogues (comics)|"Rogues"]] in future. In the season two episode "Flash of Two Worlds" it is revealed that the Mardon brothers had an encounter with [[Patty Spivot]]'s father at a bank prior to their transformation that resulted in Mark shooting him in the face, and Patty became a police officer in her quest to stop metahuman criminals. In "Running to Stand Still", Mark breaks Jesse James and Snart out of prison to join forces to kill the Flash- although Snart declines to participate- dispersing random bombs around the city in Christmas gifts to force the Flash to let them kill him or they will trigger the bombs. However, the Flash's allies find and disable all the bombs while Mark is taking his time killing the Flash, allowing them to dispose of the bombs through a dimensional breach while Barry deals with his foes. Patty attempts to kill Mark while he is immobilized, but the Flash convinces her not to become a murderer and she instead arrests Mark, taking him in to Iron Heights Prison in Central City. The season five episode "O Come, All Ye Thankful" introduces Mark's estranged daughter '''Joslyn "Joss" Jackam''' (portrayed by Reina Hardesty). Joslyn was a meteorologist who was fired after her weather experiments became too dangerous. A part of her van was struck with a fragment of the Enlightenment Satellite, which she made into a staff that enables her to control the weather like her father and uncle and become Weather Witch. After her plot to kill her father fails, Weather Witch plans to use the staff to wreak havoc on Central City, but is foiled by the Flash using the Weather Wizard's wand. The Mardons are locked together in Iron Heights.
