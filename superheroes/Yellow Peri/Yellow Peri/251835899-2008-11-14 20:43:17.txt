The '''Yellow Peri''' is a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Superboy|The New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #34 (October 1982), and was created by [[Bob Rozakis]] and [[Kurt Schaffenberger]].

==Fictional character biography==
Loretta York became interested in magic as a young child.  That interest drew her to a burned down bookstore as a teenager.  Surprisingly one book had survived the fire, a magic book containing all sorts of spells.  Using this book, Loretta became the Yellow Peri, and used her new powers to help people.  However these gestures of help often backfired.  She soon joined a traveling circus and eventually wound up in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], where she encountered [[Superboy]].
This meeting ended with Superboy throwing the magic book into space. Loretta forgot she was ever the Yellow Peri. Years later when she was an adult, the book returned from space and crashed into her home.  She again became the Yellow Peri and again encountered Superboy, now known as [[Superman]].<ref>As seen in ''[[Superboy|The New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #34-35 (October-November 1982)</ref>  

===''52''===
{{main|52 (comic book)}}
Her character faded into obscurity after that, until most recently when she appeared in the ''52'' maxi-series, as one of [[Booster Gold]]'s pallbearers alongside [[Mind-Grabber Kid]], [[Inferior Five|Blimp]], [[The Beefeater]] and [[Steve Ditko]]'s Odd Man. She was not the first choice for this task, but Booster Gold's recent actions had left him very unpopular with much of the world.<ref>As seen in ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' #18 (November 2006)</ref>

===''Reign in Hell''===
Her most recent appearance is in the ''Reign in Hell'' mini-series. She is seen in [[Hell]] helping [[Doctor Occult]] find his former partner [[Rose Psychic]]. Occult calls her a spirit guide which implies that she is dead.<ref>As seen in ''Reign in Hell'' #2 (October 2008)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
*The Yellow Peri derives all her powers from the magic book.  She is able to read its spells and use its magic by touching one hand to her forehead and the other to the book.<ref>As seen in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' #26 (April 1987)</ref>

==Other media==
Yellow Peri appeared in an episode of ''[[Superboy (TV Series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'', entitled "Yellow Peri's Spell of Doom". Originally a waitress named Loretta who was infatued with Superboy, she made a deal with a magical being named Gazook, which gives her mystic powers. After trying to use her powers to make Superboy fall in love with her, Yellow Peri attempted to kill the woman he DID love, [[Lana Lang]]. She lost her powers when the doll that housed Gazook's spirit was destroyed by Superboy.
