'''Beautiful Dreamer''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. Her first appearance was in ''[[Power Pack]]'' vol. 1 #12.  Beautiful Dreamer's real name and her past prior to joining the Morlocks remain unknown. She followed the terrorist Morlock leader [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] for a time and committed criminal acts by manipulating others with her mental powers at his behest. However, Beautiful Dreamer's primary motivation for doing so, as with most of her fellow Morlocks, is presumed to be her desire for company and community. 

==Fictional character biography==
Dreamer, along with several other Morlocks, confronts the [[Power Pack]], when the young team enters the [[New York]] sewers to look for their lost school books. The empathic Annalee, mourning her deceased children, wishes to have Beautiful Dreamer alter the memories of Power Pack. The goal is to have the Power Pack believe Annalee is their mother. Two of the X-Men, Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde, stop this plan.

When the Morlock leader Callisto had left for a time, [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] decides to re-implent Annalee's desires. The Power Pack's parents have their memory altered and ultimately, three of the Pack. The last member, Energizer, summons help from the X-Men. Callisto returns in time to undo the plan and Beautiful Dreamer restores the minds of all affected.

Beautiful Dreamer was among the few members of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] to survive the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]' "[[Mutant Massacre]]", during which most members of her community were killed. She stays with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], for a while, along with her friends, B.D., [[Tar Baby (comics)|Tar Baby]], [[Ape (comics)|Ape]] and [[Erg (comics)|Erg]]. 

There was a brief conflict with another group of Morlocks, as all of them do not get along. Dreamer's group eventually returns to the sewers in an attempt to create a new life for themselves. 

Beautiful Dreamer is one of the 198 mutants who have retained their powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities== 
She possesses the ability to psionically alter the memories of others using her special "dream smoke" as a focus.
