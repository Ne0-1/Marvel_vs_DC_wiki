'''Jason of Spartax''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
J'son of Spartax is the Emperor of the [[Spartoi]] Empire and father of Peter Quill, alias [[Star-Lord]] of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>[http://www.comicvine.com/jason-of-sparta/4005-81150/ Jason of Sparta]</ref> The Spartoi are a sister race to the [[Shi'ar]], separating from their cousins millions of year ago.

He was the only son of the previous Emperor Eson, and therefore was Prince and sole heir to the throne. Rejecting his idealism, the ruling Council of Ministers prevented J'son from taking the throne. The future emperor would be educated, as per Spartax tradition, by being brought up on dozens of the Empire's planets working many professions, including servant, miner, poet, soldier and pilot - excelling in the latter two.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

When [[Ronan the Accuser]] of the [[Kree Empire]] forced the Inhuman Royal Family to attempt to assassinate the Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]], ruler of the neighboring Shi'ar Empire during a wedding ceremony that would symbolically unite the Shi'ar and Spartoi, J'son (who had been seen with the [[Inhumans]]) was accused of being part of the plot. For this, he was banished and deemed unworthy of the throne.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

However, J'son would later be summoned by his father when war broke out between the Spartoi and the Ariguans. On his way back home, he was forced to crash land on Earth, where he fell in love with a human woman named Meredith Quill. The two began a short relationship before J'son was forced to leave to wage war for Spartax. Wishing to shield Meredith from the pain of his departure, J'son erased her memories of him, without knowing that the two had conceived a child. Meredith would later go on to give birth to his son, Peter Quill.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

J'son would eventually go on take his father's place as emperor. J'son later met his son after Peter had become Star-Lord, and offered him a place as heir to the throne. Peter refused, and in his stead J'son adopted Kip Holm as future heir.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

Years later, J'son joined other members of the Galactic Council to declare the Earth off-limits to extraterrestrial interaction. Once his son defended Earth from a [[Badoon]] attack, J'son sent Spartoi soldiers to capture him and his team of Guardians. However, the Guardians managed to escape and flee.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

In an attempt to finally get rid of the Guardians and make his son join him, all of the Guardians were separately dealt with by the Spartoi and its allies. However, they didn't count with the Guardians' ally [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], who saved Peter Quill from J'son and the Spartoi Empire. As he was escaping, Quill discredited J'son to the whole empire, revealing him as a heartless murderer. The entire Spartoi Empire rebelled against J'son, who was forced to flee.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

With no longer an empire or fortune, Ja'son became the villain known as '''Mister Knife''', and started building a criminal empire. He put a bounty on his son, and also assembled the Slaughter Squad to recover [[the Black Vortex]].{{issue|date=September 2015}}

Because of the price put on his head, Star-Lord began raiding Mister Knife's crime syndicate, unaware that he was dealing with his own father. After the Slaughter Squad managed to finally capture Star-Lord while he was on a date with [[Kitty Pryde]], Mister Knife revealed his identity to his son.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

After Peter escaped with the help of Kitty Pryde, who travelled all the way from Earth to save him, Jason tracked down to a planet the son of Thanos, Thane, and convinced him to join his cause.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

After Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde decided to steal the Black Vortex from J'son with the sole purpose to annoy him, Mister Knife sent the Slaughter Lords to hunt them down and recover the Vortex. After numerous failed attempts to recover the Vortex, Mister Knife managed to get his hands on it. As part of a deal with Thane, the son of Thanos submitted to the Black Vortex and used his cosmically enhanced power to encase the entirety of Spartax in his amber construct. The trapped Spartax was later traded to the Brood by Mister Knife, in exchange for taking advantage of their expansion and acquiring one planet for every ten worlds they conquered ever since.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

At a moment when Captain Marvel retrieved the Black Vortex, she was cornered by Thane and J'son, who demanded she give them the Vortex back. When Thane tried to use his powers to encase Carol in amber, she used the Black Vortex as a shield and deflected the attack towards J'son.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

J'son remained encased in the amber construct floating through Spartax's orbit, until he was found by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]], who was too late to recover the Vortex, but settled for adding J'son to his collection.{{issue|date=September 2015}}
