'''Shuma-Gorath''' is a [[character (fiction)|fictional character]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]], but better known for its later interpretations as a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] and Lord of Chaos appearing in the [[Marvel Universe]]. It is also well known for being a playable character in the [[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]] video game, and made subsequent appearances in the [[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)| Marvel vs. Capcom]] series. 

==Publication history==
The name "Shuma Gorath" is first used in a "[[Kull]]" short story "The Curse of the Golden Skull," which was unpublished until 1967, years after the author's death. In it, a dying magician named Rotath invokes the "iron-bound books of Shuma Gorath" in a curse against humanity. Judging from the other authors of iron-bound books appearing in Howard's stories--such as Vathelos the Blind and Skelos--we may deduce that Shuma Gorath was a human (or humanoid) sorcerer, but the character never actually appeared nor was he ever actually described.  Very likely this was an homage to [[H. P. Lovecraft]] whom Howard greatly admired and who used a very similar name--[[Shub-Niggurath]]--as an ancient invocation.

Its first comic-book appearance was as an adversary for [[Doctor Strange]] in the pages of ''[[Marvel Premiere]].''  This re-imagining of the character resembled a giant purple eye with tentacles. (In most subsequent appearances the color of the creature was changed from purple to green.)  It is likely that this version of the character was inspired by Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu Mythos]].  Like [[Cthulhu]], it was a giant tentacled creature which evoked terrible dread and was worshipped in time immemorial and long ago locked away from our plane of existence.  Speculation that Shuma-Gorath is based on Eddy C. Bertin's [[Cy√§egha]] (a very similar Cthulhu homage) do not take into account that the Marvel version's first visual depiction was in 1973, three full years before the publication of Bertin's "Darkness, My Name Is."

==Fictional character biography==
Although his true origins are unknown, before the arrival of the First Host of the Celestials, Shuma-Gorath ruled the Earth and commanded [[human sacrifice]], until the time-traveling sorcerer [[Sise-Neg]] banished him. He managed to return and set himself up as a god during the [[Hyborian Age]], again commanding bloody sacrifice, but slaughtered those who sought his favor. Eventually, the power of [[Crom]] imprisoned him within a mountain. Even from that prison, he could interact with [[Conan the Barbarian]], [[Kulan Gath]], and many others, before Crom banished him back to his home dimension.

When Shuma-Gorath tried to return to Earth through the mind of the [[Ancient One]], he forced [[Doctor Strange]] to kill his master to prevent the powerful creature from arriving on Earth. Years later, Strange was forced to destroy the talismans keeping the chaos demons at bay, to keep them from falling into the hands of an evil [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]]. Strange was then forced to travel to Shuma-Gorath's dimension and fight it there to prevent the demons from invading Earth. To do so, Strange had to absorb the chaos magic into himself, gaining enough power to destroy Shuma-Gorath. However, he started to transform into a new Shuma-Gorath himself as a result, so he committed suicide to prevent that from happening. Fortunately, an ally of Strange was able to purify him on his way back to the living. Shuma-Gorath resurrected himself not long after from the remnants of the chaos magic.

Recently, he was summoned to Earth by the sorcerer [[Nicholas Scratch]], who offered his services in return for "[his] life and [[Barbados]]". However, the demon was driven back by the combined efforts of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Salem's Seven]], and [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].

==Powers and abilities==
Shuma-Gorath is a powerful and ancient [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] of the highest order and possesses vast supernatural powers. He is essentially invincible to anything but the most powerful magic. He has superhuman strength and endurance which, being magical in nature, are incalculably high. Because of his body's unique form, he has the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and even liquefy himself. 

He also has the ability to generate several forms of energy attacks, mostly forming from his one eye. One attack not generated from his eye is when he forms a ball of pure energy that can shatter realities using all of his tentacles to generate the ball above himself. 

He can also teleport and phase at will and levitate. He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has [[reality warping]] powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.

His intelligence is nearly immeasurable, approaching omniscience.

==Appearances in other media==
Shuma-Gorath made his first appearance outside of the comics in the video game [[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]] and would later appear in every Marvel/Capcom crossover game except for [[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom]]. 

===Color===
Though he was depicted as green in most comic book appearances, he was colored purple in his video game debut, as well as in the later title [[X-Men vs. Street Fighter]], in which he made some minor [[cameo appearance]]s, just like in his comic book debut.

He was colored green in subsequent appearances in the series, [[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]] and [[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]].
