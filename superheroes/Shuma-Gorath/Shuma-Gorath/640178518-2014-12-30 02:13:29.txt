Shuma-Gorath is eventually revealed to be one of the four undying other-dimensional "[[Many-angled ones|multi-angled ones]]" guiding a metaphysical invasion from a dimension called the "[[The Thanos Imperative|cancerverse]]". In attempting to destroy [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself, the entity and its allies are rendered inert by the conceptual form of Death and subsequently are trapped in the cancerverse when it is destroyed.<ref name="TI6">''Thanos Imperative'' #6 (Nov. 2010)</ref> Shuma-Gorath survives and once again attempts to invade Earth but is repelled by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with the [[Spear of Destiny]].<ref>''Invaders Now!'' #5 (Apr. 2011)</ref>
