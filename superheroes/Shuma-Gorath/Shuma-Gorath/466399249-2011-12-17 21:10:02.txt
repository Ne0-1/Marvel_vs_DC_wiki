'''Shuma-Gorath''' is a [[character (fiction)|fictional character]] created by  [[Robert E. Howard]], best known for his later interpretations starting with [[Steve Englehart]],<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=35730</ref> as a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demonic]] enemy of [[Doctor Strange]] in [[Marvel Comics]] publications. He is also well known for being an unconventional playable character in the ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' and ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' video games.  Shuma-Gorath shares naming conventions and physical traits to creatures in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], the universe in which popular weird fiction writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] set the majority of his stories.

== Publication history ==
The name "Shuma-Gorath" is first used in the [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] short story "The Curse of the Golden Skull," which was unpublished until 1967, years after the author's death. In it, a dying magician named Rotath invokes the "iron-bound books of Shuma-Gorath" in a curse against humanity.

His first comic-book appearance was as an adversary for [[Doctor Strange]] in the pages of ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #3-9 (July 1972 - July 1973). This re-imagining of the character resembled a giant purple eye with tentacles. In most subsequent appearances the color of the creature was changed from purple to green. He was a giant tentacled creature which evoked terrible dread and was worshipped in time immemorial and long ago locked away from our plane of existence.

The character subsequently appears in ''Marvel Premiere'' #14 (March 1974): Shuma-Gorath appears on prehistoric Earth and is defeated by [[Sise-Neg]]; ''Doctor Strange'' #81 (February 1987); ''Strange Tales'' Vol. 2 #4-15 (April 1987-April 1988): the second battle between Strange and Shuma-Gorath occurs in #13-14; ''Fantastic Four'' #314 (May 1988): the story from ''Strange Tales'' crosses over and has effects on Dr. Strange which carry on into ''Strange Tales'' #15; ''Conan the Barbarian'' #252 (January 1992), #258-260 (July–September 1992): Shuma-Gorath is briefly resurrected in the Hyborian Age, although the character looks significantly different than normal; ''Marvel Knights'' #26-27 (March–April 2006): defeats the Fantastic Four but is defeated by Dr. Strange off panel; ''Wolverine: First Class'' #12 (February 2009); and ''Invaders Now!'' #4-5 (December 2010).

Shuma-Gorath received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Horror'' #1 (2005).

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Original shuma-gorath.jpg|left|thumb|In his first few appearances, Shuma-Gorath was colored purple. Art by [[Frank Brunner]].]]
Although his true origins are unknown, before the arrival of the First Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], Shuma-Gorath rules the Earth and commands [[human sacrifice]],<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #14 (March 1974)</ref> until the time-traveling sorcerer [[Sise-Neg]] banishes him.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} He manages to return and set himself up as a god during the [[Hyborian Age]], again commanding bloody sacrifice, but slaughters those who seek his favor.<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' Vol 1 #240</ref> Eventually, the power of [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]] imprisons him within a mountain. Even from that prison, he could interact with [[Conan the Barbarian]], [[Kulan Gath]], and many others, before Crom banishes him back to his home dimension.<ref>''Conan the Barbarian'' Vol 1 #260</ref>

When Shuma-Gorath tries to return to Earth through the mind of the heroic sorcerer the [[Ancient One]], he forces [[Doctor Strange]] to kill his master to prevent the powerful creature from arriving on Earth.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #3-10</ref> Years later, Strange is forced to destroy the talismans keeping the chaos demons at bay, to keep them from falling into the hands of an evil [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]]. Strange is then forced to travel to Shuma-Gorath's dimension and fight him there to prevent the demons from invading Earth. To do so, Strange absorbs the chaos magic into himself, gaining enough power to destroy Shuma-Gorath. However, he starts to transform into a new Shuma-Gorath himself as a result, so he commits suicide to prevent that from happening. An ally of Strange is able to purify him on his way back to the living.<ref>''Strange Tales'' ''"On Having No Head"'' Vol 2 #15 (1988) p. 25</ref> Shuma-Gorath resurrects himself not long after from the remnants of the chaos magic.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

Shuma-Gorath is later summoned to Earth by the sorcerer [[Nicholas Scratch]], who offers his services in return for "[his] life and [[Barbados]]". However, the demon is driven back by the combined efforts of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Salem's Seven]], and [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''Marvel Knights 4'' issues 25-27, 2006</ref>

The entity was shown to be one of the four greatest undying otherdimensional "[[Many-angled ones|multi-angled ones]]", behind the metaphysical "[[The Thanos Imperative|cancerverse]]" invasion when that universe's Captain Marvel spoke its name during an incantation, striving to destroy [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself. However, along with its brethren, it was rendered inert (requiring at least thousands of years to recuperate) by a direct counter-attack from the conceptual entity, and was then caught within the destruction of the entire reality.<ref name="TI6">''Thanos Imperative'' #6 (Nov. 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Shuma-Gorath is a powerful and ancient force of chaos of the highest order, sometimes referred to as a [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]], but unrelated and an alien concept to truly infernal beings.  He possesses vast supernatural powers, and is essentially invincible to anything but the most powerful magic; or the greatest [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)‎|cosmic entities]].<ref name="TI6" />

Because of Shuma-Gorath's unique physical form, he has the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and even liquify his body. He also has the ability to generate several forms of energy attacks, mostly forming from its one eye. One attack not generated from his eye is when he uses all of his tentacles to generate a ball of pure energy that can shatter realities.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

His powers included [[sympathetic magic]], which he demonstrated by creating a miniature replica of the planet Earth, and then transferring the effects on the replica to the real earth.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol2 #14</ref> He is capable of draining the magical energy of other beings, as Sise-Neg noted.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}

He can teleport and phase at will and levitate. He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has [[reality warping]] powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures, even powerful forces such as [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], to do his bidding.

In one of Shuma-Gorath's lesser realms, powerful demons such as Mephisto and Satannish were stated to be "mice in a great temple"<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol.2, #13</ref> and after Doctor Strange absorbed the entity's power, the sorcerer's mere aura was stated as sufficient to unconsciously destroy any nearby galaxies.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol.2, #15</ref>
