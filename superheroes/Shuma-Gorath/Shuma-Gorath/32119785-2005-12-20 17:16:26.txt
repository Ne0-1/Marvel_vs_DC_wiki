'''Shuma-Gorath''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character, a [[demon]] lord, who is part of the [[Marvel Universe]]. It first appeared in the pages of ''Marvel Premiere'', and is better known for also being a playable character in the [[Marvel vs Capcom]] video games.  It is likely that it was inspired by the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], particularly by the deity [[Cy√§egha]].
==Character biography==
===Ancient Origin===
Shuma-Gorath resembles a giant green eye with tentacles. Although his true origins are unknown, before the arrival of the First Host of the Celestials, Shuma-Gorath ruled the Earth and commanded [[human sacrifice]], until the time-travelling sorcerer Sise-Neg banished him.  He managed to return and set himself up as a god during the Hyperborean Age, again commanding bloody sacrifice, but slaughtered those who sought his favour.  Eventually, the power of Crom imprisoned him within a mountain.  Even from that prison, he could interact with [[Conan the Barbarian]], Kulan Gath, and many others, before Crom banished him back to his home dimension.

===Modern Age===
When Shuma-Gorath tried to return to Earth through the mind of the [[Ancient One]], he forced Dr. Strange to kill his master to prevent the powerful creature from arriving on Earth.

Years later, Strange was forced to destroy the talismans keeping the chaos demons at bay, to keep them from falling into the hands of an evil [[sorcerer]]. Strange was then forced to travel to Shuma-Gorath's dimension and fight it there to prevent the demons from invading Earth. To do so, Strange had to absorb the chaos magic into himself, gaining enough power to destroy Shuma-Gorath. However, he started to transform into a new Shuma-Gorath himself as a result, so he committed suicide to prevent that from happening. Fortunately, an ally of Strange was able to purify him on his way back to the living.

==Powers and abilities==
Shuma-Gorath is a powerful and ancient demon of the highest order and possesses vast supernatural powers. He is essentially invincible to anything but the most powerful magic. He has vast superhuman strength and endurance which, being magical in nature, are potentially incalculably high.

He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has reality warping powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.

His intelligence is nearly immeasurable; approaching omniscience.

==Other Media==

[[Image:Shuma.gif|thumb|left|purple Shuma-Gorath in ''Marvel Super Heroes''.]]

Perhaps due to a mistake, Shuma-Gorath was colored purple for his primary color pallete in his first appearance in [[Marvel Super-Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes.]]  As such, he appears purple in his ending as well.  This was corrected in his subsequent appearances (Or more precisely, since [[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]] because he was still purple in his cameos in X-Men vs. Street Fighter).  

Shuma-Gorath was most likely chosen for the Marvel vs. Capcom game because of his bizarre appearance, but there are some rumors that the real motive was the Japanese "[[Tentacle rape]]" fetish. It is more likely that he will reappear on future versions of the game (if [[Capcom]] gets back the Marvel license, that is), rather than in the comics.
