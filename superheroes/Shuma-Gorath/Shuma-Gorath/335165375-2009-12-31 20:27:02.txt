'''Shuma-Gorath''' is a [[character (fiction)|fictional character]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]], but better known for its later interpretations as a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] and Lord of Chaos appearing in the [[Marvel Universe]]. It is also well known for being a playable character in the ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' video game, and made subsequent appearances in the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series. 

== Publication history ==
The name "Shuma Gorath" is first used in a "[[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]]" short story "The Curse of the Golden Skull," which was unpublished until 1967, years after the author's death. In it, a dying magician named Rotath invokes the "iron-bound books of Shuma Gorath" in a curse against humanity. 

Its first comic-book appearance was as an adversary for [[Doctor Strange]] in the pages of ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #3-9 (July 1972-July 1973) This re-imagining of the character resembled a giant purple eye with tentacles. In most subsequent appearances the color of the creature was changed from purple to green. Like [[Cthulhu]], it was a giant tentacled creature which evoked terrible dread and was worshipped in time immemorial and long ago locked away from our plane of existence.

The character subsequently appears in ''Marvel Premiere'' #14 (March 1974), ''Doctor Strange'' #81 (February 1987), ''Strange Tales'' Vol. 2 #4-15 (April 1987-April 1988), ''Fantastic Four'' #314 (May 1988), ''Conan the Barbarian'' #252 (January 1992), #258-260 (July-September 1992), ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #27, ''Avengers'' #29 (June 1990), and ''Marvel Knights'' #26-27 (March-April 2006).

Shuma-Gorath received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Horror'' #1 (2005).

==Fictional character biography==
Although his true origins are unknown, before the arrival of the First Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], Shuma-Gorath rules the Earth and commands [[human sacrifice]], until the time-traveling sorcerer [[Sise-Neg]] banishes him. He manages to return and set himself up as a god during the [[Hyborian Age]], again commanding bloody sacrifice, but slaughters those who seek his favor. Eventually, the power of [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]] imprisons him within a mountain. Even from that prison, he could interact with [[Conan the Barbarian]], [[Kulan Gath]], and many others, before Crom banishes him back to his home dimension.

When Shuma-Gorath tries to return to Earth through the mind of the heroic sorcerer the [[Ancient One]], he forces [[Doctor Strange]] to kill his master to prevent the powerful creature from arriving on Earth. Years later, Strange is forced to destroy the talismans keeping the chaos demons at bay, to keep them from falling into the hands of an evil [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]]. Strange is then forced to travel to Shuma-Gorath's dimension and fight it there to prevent the demons from invading Earth. To do so, Strange absorbs the chaos magic into himself, gaining enough power to destroy Shuma-Gorath. However, he starts to transform into a new Shuma-Gorath himself as a result, so he commits suicide to prevent that from happening. Fortunately, an ally of Strange is able to purify him on his way back to the living. Shuma-Gorath resurrects himself not long after from the remnants of the chaos magic.

Shuma-Gorath is later summoned to Earth by the sorcerer [[Nicholas Scratch]], who offers his services in return for "[his] life and [[Barbados]]". However, the demon is driven back by the combined efforts of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Salem's Seven]], and [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]<ref>Marvel Knights 4  issues 25-27, 2006</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Shuma-Gorath is a powerful and ancient [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]] of the highest order and possesses vast supernatural powers. He is essentially invincible to anything but the most powerful magic. He has superhuman strength and endurance which, being magical in nature, are incalculably high. Because of his body's unique form, he has the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and even liquefy himself. 

He also has the ability to generate several forms of energy attacks, mostly forming from his one eye. One attack not generated from his eye is when he forms a ball of pure energy that can shatter realities using all of his tentacles to generate the ball above himself. 

He has powers similar to [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]], which he demonstrated by creating a miniature replica of the planet Earth, and then transferring the effects on the replica to the real earth. He is capable of draining the magical energy of other beings, as Sise-Neg noted.

He can also teleport and phase at will and levitate. He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has [[reality warping]] powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.

In one of Shuma-Gorath's lesser realms, powerful demons such as Mephisto and Satannish were stated to be "ticks" in a great temple;<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol.2, #13</ref> and after Doctor Strange absorbed the entity's power, the sorcerer's mere aura was stated as sufficient to unconsciously destroy any nearby galaxies.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol.2, #15</ref>
