Shuma-Gorath is a fictional [[comic book]] character, a [[demon]] lord, who is part of the [[Marvel Universe]]. It first appeared in the pages of the [[Doctor Strange]] comics, and is better known for also being a playable character in the [[Marvel vs Capcom]] video games. It is likely that it was inspired by the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].

Shuma-Gorath resembles a giant green eye with tentacles. According to the comics, it is the lord of the [[Chaos]] Demons, and its kind ruled the Earth on prehistoric times, until they were banished to another [[dimension]] by a collection of [[talisman]]s created by [[human sacrifice]]s. Years ago, Gorath tried to return to Earth by possessing the body of the [[Ancient One]], forcing Dr. Strange to kill his master to prevent the powerful creature from arriving on Earth.

Years later, Strange was forced to destroy the talismans keeping the chaos demons at bay, to keep them from falling into the hands of an evil [[sorcerer]]. Strange was then forced to travel to Gorath's dimension and fight it there to prevent the demons from invading Earth. To do so, Strange had to absorb the chaos magic into himself, gaining enough power to destroy Gorath. However, he started to transform into a new Gorath himself as a result, so he commited suicide to prevent that from happening. Fortunately, allies of Strange were able to resurrect and purify him.

Gorath was likely chosen for the Marvel vs. Capcom game because of its bizarre appearance. It is more likely that it will reappear on future versions of the game, rather than in the comics.
