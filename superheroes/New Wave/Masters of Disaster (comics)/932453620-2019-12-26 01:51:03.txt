==Other media==
*The Masters of Disaster appear in ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]: Thunder and Lightning'' episode "Lightning Under the Weather."

*The Masters of Disaster appear in ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' with New Wave portrayed by Brooke Ence, Shakedown portrayed by [[Hosea Chanchez]], Heatstroke portrayed by Esteban Cueto, and Coldsnap portrayed by Derrick Lewis. While New Wave and Coldsnap retain their comic book identities, Shakedown's name is '''Marcus Bishop''' and Heatstroke is a man named '''Joe'''. After [[Tobias Whale]] has his resident techie Todd Green crack the codes in an [[A.S.A. (comics)|A.S.A.]] briefcase, they find that the organization was developing metahumans for "Project Masters of Disaster". Later in the season, it is revealed that the project involved turning violent inmates into a metahuman attack squad before they were put into stasis pods for twenty-five years. The pods were then taken by Tobias so that he could utilize them for his purposes. The first member to appear is Shakedown in the episode "Book of Secrets: Chapter Three: Pillar of Fire" when Tobias awakens him to assist him in building a metahuman army by helping his hired mercenary Giselle Cutter steal more pods. In the episode "The Book of the Apocalypse: Chapter One: The Alpha," Tobias, [[Helga Jace|Dr. Helga Jace]], and Cutter release Heatstroke, Coldsnap, and New Wave from their pods. After Cutter severely wounds Shakedown for disobeying Tobias, he states that they will start their metahuman arms race by promoting Heatstroke's attack on the Dark Web. Heatstroke goes on the attack where he sets fire to different places and burns Councilman Kwame Parker after he refused to cooperate with Tobias. [[Black Lightning]] and [[Thunder (comics)|Thunder]] fight Heatstroke until Tobias reluctantly takes Jace's advice to have Heatstroke retreat. Cutter later informs Tobias of an attack by former minion [[Tattooed Man|Lala]], causing the Masters of Disaster to retreat to the rendezvous. In the episode "The Book of the Apocalypse: Chapter Two: The Omega," Coldsnap freezes a generator at the Freeland Power Plant while the 100 incite riots. While [[Peter Gambi]] and [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Lightning]] work to thaw the generator, Black Lightning and Thunder fight the Masters of Disaster. Heatstroke is shot by Lala while the others are defeated by Black Lightning and Thunder.
**Windfall appears as '''Wendy Hernandez''', portrayed by Madison Bailey, in the second season episode "The Book of Consequences: Chapter Two: Black Jesus Blues." This version of the character is one of the metahumans created by Green Light 30 years ago and kept in pods by the ASA. After being accidentally freed from her pod, she escapes and wanders Freeland delirious. She is eventually shocked out of her delirium by Black Lightning and elects to return to her pod voluntarily. Though she does not take on the identity of Windfall, the character retains her aerokinetic abilities and wears a pink-and-blue outfit reminiscent of her comic counterpart's costume.

*Windfall appears in the "[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]] episode "Leverage," voiced by [[Zehra Fazal]]. She appears as a teenage resident at the Metahuman Youth Center. Windfall is also Australian in this version as opposed to being an American like in the comics.
