'''The Masters of Disaster''' is a fictional supervillain team in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

==History==
The Masters of Disaster were enemies of Batman's [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], [[Infinity Inc.]] and the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]]. All of their powers based on elemental forces of nature.

One of their earliest defeats of the Outsiders was neutralized with the emergence of the heroine known as [[Looker (comics)|Looker]]. She manages to defeat the Masters and free the others.<ref>''Adventures of the Outsiders #34'' June 1986</ref>

They assist [[Baron Bedlam]] and his Soviet-backed invasion of the country of Markovia. This would result in the deaths of many Markovian soldiers. The Outsiders attack an enemy camp and encounters the Masters. Learning from a previous encounter, the team manages to defeat the Outsiders.

Tensions arise in the team as Windfall has developed sympathetic feelings for the Outsiders and works from behind the scenes to keep them alive. Her sister, New Wave, naturally does not like this and Shakedown simply wants the team to work in peace.

==Membership==
*'''New Wave''' -  Becky Jones' power was [[List of powers in superhero fiction#Hydrokinesis|aquakinesis]] and she could become living water, older sister of Windfall. Quite possibly insane.
*'''Shakedown''' - A big man, very strong, almost invulnerable, and could generate powerful vibratory blasts. Tries to keep the peace in the group. After opposing New Wave one too many times, she kills him.
*'''Coldsnap''' - Darryl was able to generate extreme cold, he was in love with Heatstroke; but could not touch her, due to his cold powers.
*'''Heatstroke''' - Joanne was able to generate blazing heat, she was in love with Coldsnap; but could not touch him, due to her heat powers.
*'''Windfall''' - Wendy Jones had [[List of powers in superhero fiction#Aerokinesis|aerokinetic]] abilities. She had sympathetic feelings for the Outsiders member [[Halo (comics)|Halo]], which caused tension. Later leaves the Masters to join the Outsiders.  Recently resurfaced as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] and was killed by [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] in a mission.
