The character is portrayed by [[Corey Stoll]] in the film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'s iteration of '''[[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]'''.

==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
Darren Cross is a millionaire and the founder of a [[Cross Technological Enterprises|successful corporation]], Darren Cross Haulage, which rivals its unidentified top competitors. Cross was diagnosed with a heart condition due to overwork, and had to use an experimental nucleorganic pacemaker in order to save his life. The pacemaker was a success but enhanced Cross's circulatory system, mutating his body and giving him superhuman abilities. With a side effect that overuse causes the burning out of his heart, Cross went through various heart transplants, which led him to capture surgeon Dr. Erica Sondheim to replace his heart and to abduct "donors" from the slums.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47. Marvel Comics</ref> This attracted the attention of the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] looking for Sondheim in order to save [[Cassandra Lang|his own daughter]]'s life. The resulting battle with Ant-Man burned out Cross's heart, as Sondheim had reimplanted his old, worn-out heart prior to Ant-Man crashing the surgery.<ref name="MarvelPrem48">''Marvel Premiere'' #48. Marvel Comics</ref> 

However, Cross's body was revealed to have been kept in a cryogenic state as his son [[Augustine Cross]], having taken over as the family company head after his father's death,<ref>''Iron Man'' #145. Marvel Comics</ref> later became obsessed with bringing Darren back to life and eventually forced Dr. Sondheim to help.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics</ref> Enlisting [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]]'s assistance, Augustine had orchestrated Cassie Lang's capture as the girl's heart is required to withstand the unique conditions when transplanted into Darren. While infiltrating Cross's company to rescue Cassie, Ant-Man came across his restored nemesis.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics</ref> Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while Ant-Man buys time for Sondheim to transplant another heart to Cassie. Cross is ultimately forced to flee with his son when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Darren Cross was later approached by [[Power Broker]] II to demonstrate his latest "Hench" App by hiring [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to kill Ant-Man. However, Cross was unwilling to give Power Broker the 1.2&nbsp;billion dollars he demanded for investment in the Hench app. This caused Power Broker to cancel the demo and cancel Whirlwind's assassination on Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1</ref>

Cross later represented his own company when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of [[Alchemax]], [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] of Fisk Industries, [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] of Shaw Industries, [[Zeke Stane]] of Stane International, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]]'s and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]'s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. Cross also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 2 #8</ref>

In order to combat Ant-Man, Cross recruited [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] to work for him at his company. Egghead helped Cross control his Pym Particle abilities by creating the Yellowjacket armor for him.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #12</ref> Cross, Egghead and Crossfire attacked during his nemesis's trial in Cassie's place, but were engaged by Ant-Man, [[She-Hulk]] (as Scott's defending attorney), Miss Thing, [[Grizzly (comics)#Grizzly (Maxwell Markham)|Grizzly]], [[Machinesmith]], and Stinger. Cross was defeated by Stinger, which led to [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Peggy Rae|Peggy Rae]]'s final approval of Scott's superhero life and Scott's acquittal in court.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Yellowjacket appears as a member of [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Darren Cross's pacemaker made for his heart gave him superhuman abilities like slightly superhuman strength and increased sensory perception (especially eye-sight); but the side-effect has it burning out each heart that is transplanted into him.<ref name="MarvelPrem48"></ref> After gaining Cassie Lang's Pym Particles-equipped heart during the heart transplant, he gained size-shifting abilities with so far no control of it. It was shown that he can grow when angry and shrink when calm.{{fact|date=November 2015}}

In his Yellowjacket suit, he can use his own Pym Particles to power the suit as a quantum weapon.

Cross pushes Pym out of his mentor's namesake company and takes over as CEO, stemming from an obsession with duplicating the original Ant-Man's shrinking technology. Cross attempts this with his Yellowjacket suit despite his imperfect shrinking technology, which slowly drives him mad as it alters his brain's chemistry. While trying to sell the Yellowjacket suit to [[Mitchell Carson]]'s [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] faction and the [[Mandarin (comics)|Ten Rings]], Cross has a confrontation with Scott, resulting in Cross donning the Yellowjacket suit to stop the new Ant-Man. When Scott and Hank completely destroy Pym Technologies' work, Yellowjacket tries to exact revenge by threatening Scott's [[Cassandra Lang|daughter]]. But Scott stops him by shrinking into the Yellowjacket suit and messing with its functions, resulting in him shrinking uncontrollably.
