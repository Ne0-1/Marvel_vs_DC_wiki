The character is portrayed by [[Corey Stoll]] in the film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''.

==Publication history==
Darren Cross first appears in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 and was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[David Micheline]].

==Fictional character biography==
Darren Cross is a millionaire who was responsible for the creation of a [[Cross Technological Enterprises|successful corporation]] that rivals its top competitors. However, Darren was diagnosed with a heart condition due to overwork, and had to use an experimental nucleorganic pacemaker in order to save his life. Despite being a success, the pacemaker additionally enhanced Darren's circulatory system, mutating his body and giving him superhuman abilities, although the primary side effect from overuse is the burning out of his heart. Darren went through various heart transplants because of this, leading him to capture heart surgeon Dr. Erica Sondheim to replace his heart, as well as abducting "donors" from the slums.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47. Marvel Comics</ref> This attracted the attention of the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] looking for Sondheim in order to save [[Cassandra Lang|his own daughter]]'s life. The resulting battle with Ant-Man burned out Darren's heart as Sondheim had given him an old heart prior to Ant-Man crashing the surgery.<ref name="MarvelPrem48">''Marvel Premiere'' #48. Marvel Comics</ref> 

However, Darren's body was revealed to have kept in a cryogenic state as his son [[List of Marvel Comics characters: C#Augustine Cross|Augustine Cross]], having taken over as the family company head after his father's death,<ref>''Iron Man'' #145. Marvel Comics</ref> later became obsessed with bringing Darren back to life and eventually forced Dr. Sondheim to help.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics</ref> Enlisting the aid of [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], Augustine had orchestrated Cassie Lang's capture as the girl's heart is required to withstand the unique conditions when transplanted into Darren. While infiltrating Cross Technological Enterprises to rescue Cassie, Ant-Man came across his restored nemesis.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics</ref> Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while Ant-Man buys time for Sondheim to transplant another heart to Cassie. Darren is ultimately forced to flee with his son when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down.<ref>''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics</ref>

Darren Cross was later approached by [[Power Broker]] II to demonstrate his latest "Hench" App by hiring [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to kill Ant-Man. However, Cross was unwilling to give Power Broker the 1.2 billion dollars he demanded for investment in the Hench app. This caused Power Broker to cancel the demo and cancel Whirlwind's assassination on Ant-Man.<ref>''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Darren Cross' pacemaker made for his heart gave him superhuman abilities like slightly superhuman strength and increased sensory perception (especially eye-sight); but the side-effect has it burning out each heart that is transplanted into him.<ref name="MarvelPrem48"></ref>  After his Pym Particles-equipped heart transplant, he can also shrink his size, albeit without his control.{{fact|date=November 2015}}
