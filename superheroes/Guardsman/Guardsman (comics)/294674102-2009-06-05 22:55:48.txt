===Fictional character biography===
The first Guardsman was Kevin O'Brien, who was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He was an engineer and inventor working for the newly-opened Lakani Island plant of Stark Industries who came to the attention of Tony Stark when he invented a stun-ray that managed to harmlessly disperse a crowd of violent protestors. Stark invited O'Brien to transfer to Stark's main plant on Long Island, New York, and he accepted. Despite a careless streak that once caused the laboratory he was working in to explode, he became a close friend of Stark, and was soon appointed head of Stark's research department. On several occasions, O'Brien assisted Stark and his supposed bodyguard Iron Man (really Stark himself), notably against the [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] and his assistants the Espionage Elite, saving Stark's life on more than one occasion. Stark then decided to reveal to O'Brien that he was secretly Iron Man, and to build for him a second suit of armor for use in the event of an emergency. That emergency would come a short time later, when Iron Man and his girlfriend Marianne Rogers were taken captive by the superhuman madman Mikas the Soulfather. Putting on the armor before it was fully tested, O'Brien fell prey to a malfunction in the cybernetic circuitry controlling the armor which apparently stimulated the regions of the brain where rage and jealousy originate.

O'Brien found himself seized with sudden attraction for Stark's girlfriend Marianne Rogers, and became extremely jealous of Stark's power, looks and fortune. At the same time, Simon Gilbert, then [[board of directors|Chairman of the Board]] of Stark Industries' stockholders, grew alarmed that Stark was moving out of munitions production and mapped strategies with the board to seize controlling interest in the firm from its principal stockholder, Stark himself. O'Brien—clad in armor and calling himself the '''Guardsman'''—offered to aid the board in their plot against Stark. As a show of support, he agreed to quell a protest rally outside the plant. The Guardsman aimed his repulsor rays at the crowd, injuring four protestors. Sickened by what he did, O'Brien turned on the renegade board members, roughing them up. But seeing Tony Stark with Marianne Rogers caused him to once again become unbalanced and he went outside to vent his rage on the growing crowd of protestors. Stark donned his Iron Man armor and engaged the Guardsman in battle to prevent him from doing more damage. Losing, the Guardsman sought refuge in an experimental tank. In an attempt to stop him without hurting him, Iron Man trained his repulsor rays on the vehicle and accidentally hit its fuel supply. The tank exploded, killing O'Brien.<ref>''Iron Man'' #43, 45-46</ref>

===Fictional character biography===
Michael O'Brien was born in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].  Some months after his brother Kevin's death, when the details of the incident came to public light, Michael, a sergeant on the New York City police force, decided that the official investigation exonerating Iron Man's actions was a cover-up. Reopening the investigation without official sanction, detective O'Brien confronted Stark, interrogated several of his employees, and declared his intention of proving Stark responsible for his brother's death.<ref>''Iron Man'' #82</ref>

O'Brien finally hired an unscrupulous private investigator to get him inside the Long Island plant. There O'Brien located the Guardsman armor and put it on, determined to use it to bring Iron Man to justice. However, the malfunction in the cybernetic circuitry that affected his brother also affected Michael's brain and he flew into a rage seeking to kill Iron Man. Iron Man confronted his attack and finally convinced him that the armor was causing him to act insanely. O'Brien collapsed on rebelling against his own urge to kill Iron Man. Stark took O'Brien into custody rather than press criminal charges, hoping to convince the man of his innocence in Kevin's death. While Stark worked on a new set of armor, the Japanese mutant [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] attacked the plant. Stark was unable to put on his new armor since it had not yet cooled, and unable to find any of his spare suits of armor since a saboteur had stolen them. Hence he was forced to put on the Guardsman armor to fight off Sunfire. O'Brien witnessed Stark's heroic attempts to save lives over a video monitor, aware that Stark was risking a major heart attack by the strenuous activity. Escaping confinement, O'Brien decided he was wrong about Stark and determined to help him by donning the now-cooled Iron Man armor. Thus clad, he was mistaken for the real Iron Man and kidnapped by the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. Stark discovered an old set of Iron Man armor that the saboteur had overlooked and went to China to rescue O'Brien. Upon rescuing him, Stark chose to reveal his true identity to O'Brien before he went off to battle the Mandarin. O'Brien flew back to New York where he took custody of the Guardsman armor once more.<ref>''Iron Man'' #96-99</ref>

After Iron Man defeated the Mandarin, Stark fixed the malfunction in the Guardsman armor's circuitry so it was safe to wear. Michael O'Brien was determined to use the armor to vindicate both his brother's and his own senseless actions. When Stark International was taken over by the criminal [[Midas (comics)|Midas]], the Guardsman joined with a number of Stark's other friends and allies to battle Midas' men. He was turned to gold by Midas' power, but was later restored to flesh. Having quit the police force, O'Brien interviewed for the position of security director at [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]], the government energy research facility, after its previous director, [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], quit. With a high recommendation by Tony Stark, O'Brien got the job. Sometime later, while guarding the Project, O'Brien's Guardsman armor was damaged in a battle with the subhuman [[Subterranea (comics)|Lava Men]]. It was later repaired at the Project's expense. O'Brien, as the Guardsman, has been living and working full-time in the Project since his appointment and has performed his duties capably.

Later, he was the security chief at [[Avengers Mansion]] for some time.

==Powers and abilities==
Both Guardsman wore powered armor designed by Tony Stark and Stark Industries. The Guardsman armor contained a powered exoskeleton that gave the wearer superhuman strength allowing the operator to lift 40 tons under optimal conditions (for about 3 minutes). The armor's high-carbon steel alloy mesh and radiation shielding also offer protection from most ballistic and even energy weapons. The armor can fly via chemically powered boot jets at a maximum speed of {{convert|250|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for 3 hours, and contains 30 minutes air supply for submersion or high altitude flight.

Each palm of the Guardsman armor's gauntlets contains a charged ion "repulsor ray" emitter capable of 45 seconds continuous discharge at a range of {{convert|40|ft|m}} before irregularities in plasma cone diffuse the beam.

Kevin O'Brien had earned a Ph. D. in engineering, with expertise in engineering and was a gifted inventor. He also used a "stun-ray" device as a weapon.

Michael O'Brien is a good hand-to-hand combatant, and was coached by [[Captain America]]. As a policeman, he carried a police issue handgun, and as Avengers security chief he used "stun guns" and other advanced weaponry.

Both Kevin and Michael suffered from emotional instability that was exacerbated by the cybernetic circuitry in the original Guardsman battle-suit, causing both men to go insane. Michael O'Brien was able to wear the Guardsman armor safely after psychologically coming to terms with his trauma over his brother's death. The armor circuitry has since been modified by Anthony Stark to prevent its causing such adverse effects.

==Other media==
===Television===
* The Mandroids appear in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' episode "Armor Wars" Pt. 2. When Iron Man invaded the Vault to disable the Guardsman armors, he ended up in a fight with them and Hawkeye. Iron Man used the Negator Packs on them and discovered that they don't use his technology.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}
