{{in-universe}}
'''Dr. Mendell Stromm''' was the partner of [[Norman Osborn]] in OsCorp Industries.  Osborn became so power-corrupted, he wanted the company - and the money for the experimental 'Goblin Serum' - all to himself. Osborn framed Stromm for embezzlement, sending him to prison. After several years, Stromm was released from jail and tried to kill Norman Osborn for revenge using evil robots, but was stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and seemingly died of a heart attack. 

Over thirty years later (in real time), however, he came back as the cyborg called Gaunt and it was revealed that he survived through a cybernetic suit fused to his body - attached by none other than Osborn, who had discovered that he had survived through the Goblin Serum, but on a level of consciousness supported only by his suit. Eventually, via [[Seward Trainer]], he was cured of his need for the suit and came back in a big suit of robotic armor, only for it to be destroyed by [[Ben Reilly]]. Shortly afterward, Norman Osborn knocked him out with a laser blast and left him for dead, though he survived and only had amnesia. He came back in yet another robot suit, only to be stopped by Spider-Men yet again. 

Eventually he tried to create a [[artificial intelligence|sentient robot]] to kill Osborn, but it turned on him and destroyed his body, keeping his severed head alive in a tortured state. This artificial intelligence then attempted to take over [[New York City]]'s electrical grid, but was stopped when Spider-Man fought his way into it's [[central processing unit|core processor]] and uploaded a [[computer virus]] into it, putting both the A.I. and Mendel into a [[comatose]] state.

===In other media===
Stromm appeared in [[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]], the movie with a small role in the beginning of the movie.  Osborn wasn't so power-corrupted, as he was in the comics, so he didn't frame Stromm for anything.  They were working on a the Human-Performance-Enhancers project and Osborn was so desperate in concluding the project, he decided to do human-testing, despite it wasn't done and when they did the experiment on rodents, they showed an 800% increase of strength but the side affect was serious: violence, aggression and insanity.  Stromm decided to take it back to formula but they did the human-testing with Osborn.  Unfortunately, Osborn died but came back to life to find Stromm in front of him.  He grabbed Stromm by the throat, threw him out of a glass window and into vials of chemicals, killing him.
