'''Dr. Mendel Stromm''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #37 (June 1966).

==Fictional character biography==
Stromm was [[Norman Osborn]]'s college professor, and became his partner in OsCorp Industries. His early research was on a chemical that would provide enhanced strength in its test subjects (and would eventually turn Osborn into the [[Green Goblin]]).  Osborn, wanting the formula for himself, discovered that Stromm had been embezzling funds from OsCorp. Stromm explained that he was merely borrowing but Osborn still turned him over to the police. After several years in prison, Stromm was released and tried to kill Norman Osborn for revenge using evil robots.  He was stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and seemingly died of a heart attack. 

Stromm had made plans for his death, however, by arranging to have his brain waves transferred to a robot double.  Now calling himself '''Robot Master''', Stromm returned in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #68 (July 1982).  Spider-Man defeated and destroyed the robot double.

In ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #233 (April 1996), Stromm returned again, this time as a cyborg called '''Gaunt.'''  It was revealed that he survived through a cybernetic suit fused to his body - attached by none other than Osborn.  Osborn had discovered that Stromm had survived his heart attack thanks to the Goblin Serum, but on a level of consciousness supported only by his suit. Eventually, via [[Seward Trainer]], he was cured of his need for the suit and came back in a big suit of robotic armor, only for it to be destroyed by [[Ben Reilly]]. Shortly afterward, Norman Osborn knocked him out with a laser blast and left him for dead, though he survived and only had amnesia. He came back in yet another robot suit, only to be stopped by Spider-Men yet again. 

In ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #27 (March 2001), Stromm tried to create a [[artificial intelligence|sentient robot]] to kill Osborn, but it turned on him and destroyed his body, keeping his severed head alive. This artificial intelligence then attempted to take over [[New York City]]'s electrical grid, but was stopped when Spider-Man fought his way into its [[central processing unit|core processor]] and uploaded a [[computer virus]] into it, putting both the A. I. and Mendel into a [[comatose]] state (''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #28).

In [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance: Relentless]], it is revealed that Spider-Man tipped [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] off to Stromm's whereabouts and that they were able to rescue him from the suspended loop he was stuck in.  He eagerly registered as part of the Initiative.  

Later, Penance goes [[AWOL]] on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and stages an assault on Stromm's home, threatening to kill him unless Stromm tells him how to activate nuclear launch codes Penance has stolen in a bid to get [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] deported from [[Latveria]].<ref>Penance: Relentless #2</ref>

==In other media==
===Film===
A different version of Mendel Stromm appears in the 2002 ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' film as a scientist employed by Oscorp to develop [[Doping (sport)|Human Performance Enhancers]]. He also assists Norman Osborn ([[Willem Dafoe]]) in his attempt to use the still-unstable serum on himself; but after acquiring his powers, Osborn's resulting 'Goblin' personality kills Stromm in an uncontrollable rage.  Stromm is played by [[Ron Perkins]].

===Animated series===
Stromm also appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man (animated series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series.  He is one of the scientists working for Oscorp on the experiment that caused Norman Osborn to become the Green Goblin. Stromm is also aware of Osborn's connections to Wilson Fisk, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].  Interestingly, this version was called Wardell, not Mendel.
