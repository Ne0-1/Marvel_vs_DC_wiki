'''Dr. Mendel Stromm''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] that has also been known as '''Robot Master''' and '''Gaunt'''. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #37 (June 1966).

==Fictional character biography==
Mendel Stromm was [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s college professor and later became Osborn's partner in OsCorp Industries. His early research was on a chemical that would provide enhanced strength in its test subjects (and would eventually turn Osborn into the [[Green Goblin]]).  Osborn, wanting the formula for himself, discovered that Stromm had been embezzling funds from OsCorp. Stromm explained that he was merely borrowing but Osborn turned him over to the police. After several years in prison, Stromm was released and tried to kill Norman Osborn for revenge using evil robots. He was stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and seemingly died of a heart attack when he was nearly shot.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #37 (1966)</ref>

Stromm had made plans for his death, however, by arranging to have his brain waves transferred to a robot double.  Now calling himself '''Robot Master''', Stromm returned in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #68 (July 1982).  Spider-Man defeated and destroyed the robot double.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #68 (July 1982)</ref>

In ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #233 (April 1996), Stromm returned again, this time as a cyborg called '''Gaunt.'''  It was revealed that he survived through a cybernetic suit fused to his body - attached by none other than Osborn.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #233 (April 1996)</ref> Osborn had discovered that Stromm had survived his heart attack thanks to the Goblin Serum, but on a level of consciousness supported only by his suit. Eventually, via [[Seward Trainer]], he was cured of his need for the suit and came back in a large suit of robotic armor,{{issue|date=December 2012}} only for it to be destroyed by [[Ben Reilly]] and Peter Parker despite Stromm's attempt to defeat them both with two flying robots and three childlike androids attacking simultaneously.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Shortly afterward, Norman Osborn knocked him out with a laser blast and left him for dead, though he survived and only had amnesia.{{issue|date=December 2012}} He came back in yet another robot suit, only to be stopped by Spider-Man once again.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #27 (March 2001), Stromm tried to create a [[artificial intelligence|sentient robot]] to kill Osborn, but it turned on him and destroyed his body, keeping his severed head alive.{{issue|date=December 2012}} This artificial intelligence then attempted to take over [[New York City]]'s electrical grid, but was stopped when Spider-Man fought his way into its [[central processing unit|core processor]] and uploaded a [[computer virus]] into it, putting both the A. I. and Mendel into a [[coma]]tose state.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #28</ref>

The artificial intelligence took over [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s body and tried to use his powers to create a horde of self spawning robots,{{issue|date=December 2012}} but after the interference of Spider-Man the AI altered Spidey's spider sense, after which Spider-Man defeated the AI.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

In [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance: Relentless]], it is revealed that Spider-Man tipped [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] off to Stromm's whereabouts and that they were able to rescue him from the suspended loop he was stuck in.{{issue|date=December 2012}} He eagerly registered as part of the Initiative.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Later, Penance goes [[AWOL]] on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and stages an assault on Stromm's home, threatening to kill him unless Stromm tells him how to activate nuclear launch codes Penance has stolen in a bid to get [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] deported from [[Latveria]].<ref>''Penance: Relentless'' #2</ref>
