==Fictional character biography==
Arisen Tyrk was the tyrannical god-king of the dimension called [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|Other Realm]].  He sought the power of the Godstone, which was bonded to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] as the Man-Wolf.  Tyrk hired [[Kraven the Hunter]] to attack Man-Wolf, but Man-Wolf fought Kraven off.  Rebels from Other Realm brought the Man-Wolf to their land and he deposed Tyrk.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Tyrk tried to escape though an extra-dimensional portal, but the portal was damaged and fragmented Tyrk into a number of forms in a number of realms.  Four of Tyrk's fragments went to Earth, becoming the crazed Lunatik. These four duplicates of Tyrk plagued the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] until they were able to re-merge Lunatik into a more-or-less-whole Tyrk.  He fought the Defenders in this form, but they were eventually able to defeat him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

For a time he posed as drama professor Harrison Turk at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | date = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30–33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>

==Other characters named Lunatik==
There is also a cosmic mercenary by the name of Lunatik.  He once killed one of Tyrk's fragments, claiming that he didn't like anyone else "using his name."  He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #172 (Jan 1995).

This Lunatik was seen on a prison ship, the ''Dredge 01'', that was on its way to the [[Kyln]]. When it then crashed on Earth with [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Paibok]], and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] as the only survivors. He seemingly met his end at the Destroyer's hand.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer; Annihilation'' #1-4</ref>
