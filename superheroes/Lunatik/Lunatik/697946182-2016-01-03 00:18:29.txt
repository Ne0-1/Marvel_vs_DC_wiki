==Fictional character biography==
Arisen Tyrk was the tyrannical god-king of the dimension called [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|Other Realm]]. He sought the power of the Godstone, which was bonded to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] as the Man-Wolf. Tyrk hired [[Kraven the Hunter]] to attack Man-Wolf, but Man-Wolf fought Kraven off.  Rebels from Other Realm brought the Man-Wolf to their land and he deposed Tyrk.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Tyrk tried to escape though an extra-dimensional portal, but the portal was damaged and fragmented Tyrk into a number of forms in a number of realms.  Four of Tyrk's fragments went to Earth, becoming the crazed Lunatik. These four duplicates of Tyrk plagued the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] until they were able to re-merge Lunatik into a more-or-less-whole Tyrk.  He fought the Defenders in this form, but they were eventually able to defeat him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

For a time he posed as drama professor Harrison Turk at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | date = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30–33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>

==Other characters named Lunatik==
===Cosmic mercenary===
There is also a cosmic mercenary by the name of Lunatik. He once killed one of Tyrk's fragments, claiming that he didn't like anyone else "using his name."{{issue|date=February 2013}} He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #172 (Jan 1995). This Lunatik was seen on a prison ship, the ''Dredge 01'', that was on its way to the [[Kyln]]. When it then crashed on Earth with [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Paibok]], and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] as the only survivors. He seemingly met his end at the Destroyer's hand.<ref>''Drax The Destroyer: Earthfall'' #1-4</ref>

This Lunatik or a possible fragment appeared (in another prison) as Dirty Wolff in ''[[Deadpool]]''.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* The ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' episode "Take the Milano and Run" features a different type of Lunatik voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. He owns a club on the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s space station Conjunction and is an old contact of [[Star-Lord]]. It is mentioned by Star-Lord that Lunatik prefers to be called "Lou." Star-Lord and Gamora went to his club to seek him out in order to obtain some Pandorum Crystals. During this meeting, it is shown that Lunatik is dating an A'askvarii named "Lucy" (whom Star-Lord used to date). When [[Gamora]] and Lucy fought, [[Nova Corps]] member Titus showed up to break up the fight. Lunatik ended up vouching for Gamora and Star-Lord since the fight is in his club. Lunatik and Lucy later watched the fight between Gamora and Drax the Destroyer.
