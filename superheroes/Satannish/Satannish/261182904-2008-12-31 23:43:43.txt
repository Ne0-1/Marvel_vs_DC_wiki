==Fictional character biography==
Satannish is a very powerful extra-dimensional [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] who has clashed with [[Doctor Strange]]{{Fact|date=August 2008}}. Satannish is known for granting mortals mystical power in exchange for their souls. He is sometimes referred to as the son of [[Dormammu]],<ref>''Hellcat'' #3</ref> and the father of [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

He has granted power to his cult, the [[Sons of Satannish]],<ref>''[[Doctor Strange]]'' #175 (December 1968)</ref> and once empowered the [[Night Shift (comics)|Night Shift]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #76-79 (November 1991-February 1992)</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
Satannish is one of many dark powers imprisoned within Avalon. He is freed, along with all the others, when [[Pete Wisdom]] releases Merlin<ref name="CBMI3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 3 | Date = September 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>. After hearing the invading [[Skrull]]s boast that they will subjugate all magical beings, Satannish and the others kill the Skrull forces invading Avalon<ref name="CBMI4">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = [[Jesse Delperdang]] | Story = The Guns Of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI: 13 | Issue = 4 | Date = October 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>. 

He then offers Wisdom a boon, as repayment for his freedom - Wisdom's response is "No more Skrulls" and Satannish honours this, using his powers to immediately kill every Skrull within Avalon and the United Kingdom. It is stated that Satannish's gift also means that any Skrull entering the United Kingdom immediately dies.<ref name="CBMI4" />

===X-Infernus===
While in [[Otherplace|Limbo]], the recently resurrected [[Illyana Rasputin]] attacks various other demons looking for her soulsword and the original bloodstone amulet. This does not go unnoticed by him, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], [[Dormammu]] and [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. When Mephisto asks why they should concern themselves with a minor annoyance, Satannish reveals he is quite impressed by Illyana.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref>
