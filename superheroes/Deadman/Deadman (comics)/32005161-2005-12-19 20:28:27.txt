'''Deadman''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] in the comic book series, ''[[Strange Adventures]]'', specifically in issue #205 (October [[1967]]).


== Character History ==

He is a [[ghost]], formerly a [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] [[acrobatics|acrobat]] named Boston Brand, who was murdered during a trapeze performance by a mysterious assailant known only as Hook.  His spirit was granted the power to [[Spiritual possession|possess]] any living being by a Hindu [[goddess]] named [[Rama]] Kushna, in order to search for his murderer and obtain justice.  However, Brand found himself obliged to help others while on his search, using his power to intervene and control living persons to help the innocent.

The series, which could be described as a mixture of the ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' and ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', is most associated with the naturalistic art style of [[Neal Adams]] and the writing of [[Bob Haney]], who took over from Drake and Infantino shortly after the series began.  The Adams run was reprinted in 1985 as a 7-issue series.  Although he appeared from time to time in the 1970s and 80s as a supporting character in various comics, he did not get his own series again until 1986, namely a 4-issue miniseries written by [[Andrew Helfer]] and drawn by [[Jos√© Luis Garcia Lopez]] which followed the plot immediately after the Adams storyline.  There was another Deadman series in 2002, this time nine issues, as well as a couple standalone issues.  His cameo appearances also continued, including several issues of [[Alan Moore]]'s run on [[Swamp Thing]]. His most recent cameo is in book two of [[Batman: County Lines]], which was released 2 November 2005.

Ultimately, the character eventually found out the truth about his murder and came to accept his role as an intervenor in mortals' lives.

The character and self-titles series have won several awards over the years, including the 1967 Alley Award for Best New Strip (by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] in [[Strange Adventures]]), and the 1968 Alley Award Hall of Fame (for [[Neal Adams]]).

DC Comics published a slipcased hardcover edition collecting the original Deadman stories on [[December 1]], [[2001]].


== Other Media ==
Deadman will appear on an upcoming episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' played by [[Raphael Sbarge]].
