'''Deadman''' ('''Boston Brand''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #205 (October 1967), and was created by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Carmine Infantino]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link = Robert Greenberger|contribution = Deadman|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 96|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017|postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Publication history==
The series is most associated with the art of [[Neal Adams]], who took over from Infantino after the first story, and the writing of Jack Miller, who succeeded Drake after the first two stories, although Miller is miscredited in several reprints as having taken over the writing after only one issue by Drake.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/21424/ ''Strange Adventures'' #206 (Nov. 1967)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> The first story and all of the Adams stories were reprinted in 1985 as a seven-issue series.

Although he appeared from time to time in the 1970s and 1980s as a supporting character in various comics, including Jack Kirby's ''[[Forever People]]'', Deadman did not get his own series again until 1986, in a four-issue [[limited series]] written by Andrew Helfer and drawn by [[José Luis García-López]], which picked up the story where Adams left off. Deadman's next major storyline was in ''[[Action Comics]] Weekly'', in 1988-1989. After this, he starred in the two-issue series ''Deadman: Love After Death'', drawn by [[Kelley Jones]] and written by [[Mike Baron]]. This was followed by the limited series ''Deadman: Exorcism'' in 1992, also written by Mike Baron and drawn by Kelley Jones. Jones' gaunt, zombie-like rendition of the character would later appear in the pages of Batman. There was a Deadman [[ongoing series]] in 2002, which lasted nine issues, as well as a couple of standalone issues. His cameo appearances also continued, including several issues of [[Alan Moore]]'s run on ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', and [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Books of Magic]]''. He had a cameo in book two of  ''Batman: Gotham County Line'', which was released in November 2005. In 2009, Deadman was a featured title in the [[Wednesday Comics]].

The character and self-titled series have won several awards, including the 1967 Alley Award for Best New Strip (by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] in [[Strange Adventures]]), and the 1968 Alley Award Hall of Fame (for [[Neal Adams]]).

DC Comics published a slipcased hardcover edition collecting the original Deadman stories in December 2001.

Deadman's [[retcon]]ned origin is revealed in ''[[Brightest Day]]'' #14 (2010), written by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Peter Tomasi]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Strangeadventures207.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Deadman in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #207 (Dec, 1967). Art by [[Neal Adams]].]]
Deadman is a [[ghost]], formerly a [[circus]] [[trapeze|trapeze artist]] named '''Boston Brand''' who performed under the name Deadman, a stage persona including a red costume and white corpse makeup. When Brand is murdered during a trapeze performance by a mysterious assailant known only as the Hook (in fact his last words were "Gee, from up here it almost looks like that guy with the hook for a hand has a gun..."), his spirit is given the power to [[Spirit possession|possess]] any living being by a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] (created for the purposes of the story) named '''Rama Kushna''' (a corruption of [[Rama]]-[[Krishna]]), in order to search for his murderer and obtain justice. It is established in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' Vol 4, #4, that Deadman believes Rama is the supreme being of the universe.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The origin story involved the hero fighting [[narcotic]]s smugglers, in the first story to involve drugs with the permission of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. The criminals used the traveling circus they worked for to smuggle "snow" (either [[heroin]] or [[cocaine]]).

In the pages of ''[[Nightwing]]'' (issues #102 and #103, respectively) it is implied that Brand got the idea for his costume from Johnny Grayson, father of [[Dick Grayson]] (the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] who renames himself Nightwing).

At the end of the Neal Adams story line, Deadman seems to discover the truth behind his murder and we learn the ultimate fate of Hook, who killed Deadman as part of an initiation into a society of contract killers who then kill him to silence him.  However, in 1972 writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]] was told by the DC editors to put a Deadman crossover into his book ''[[Forever People|The Forever People]]''.  Kirby had never heard of Deadman, but he obligingly included the character in ''The Forever People'' #9 and 10.  [[Mark Evanier]] pointed out to Kirby a problem with the original story that he could use for the crossover.  In the origin story, Hook has his hook on his right hand.  Yet in the penultimate Neal Adams story, where his secret is revealed and he meets his fate, the man we think is Hook has his hook on his left hand.  This was probably just an artist's error—in the final Neal Adams ''Deadman'', in the synopsis of the previous issue, the hook is back on the right hand again.  Kirby, however, uses this clue to reopen the case of Deadman, with the real Hook one among many one-handed men who work for an organization known as "The Scavengers".

===Various missions===
Over the course of several years, Rama Kushna has Deadman confront the sorcerer [[Caldera (comics)|Caldera]] multiple times over the fate of the souls of several deceased superheroes. Two of them are [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]] and [[Jason Todd]] (another Robin). During the Robin incident, he tries to possess the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] but was driven out by the man's insanity.

Rama also maintained a city for some time, called [[Nanda Parbat]]. The most evil people in the world came to live there, where Rama's power kept them sane and good. One of the worst was Darius Caldera, who almost destroyed the world when he left the city. Unfortunately, Nanda later fell due to a combined military and mystical force. All the evil people are now back in the real world, still a danger.

His twin brother, Cleveland, is killed while possessed by Boston, while doing Boston's circus act. The killer was out to kill Boston Brand. His "benefactor," Rama Kushna, also dies in order to defeat Jonah, a spirit similar to Deadman.

Around this time, Deadman assists the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in defeating a newly formed demonic being and werewolves. Formed from the skeletons of many souls in hell, this blue-eyed, blonde-haired being comes to Earth to foment chaos and death. It manages to actually remove much of the Spectre's substance. Deadman is forced to merge with Spectre until things are stabilized.

Later, Deadman receives a birthday present from his diminutive friend, Max Loomis. Max places himself in a trance so he could "meet" Deadman and the two take a pleasant journey down "memory lane," mainly Deadman's more pleasant memories of Nanda Parbat. Soon after, Loomis meets with old circus friends and Deadman involves himself in a case of suspected murder. Deadman wants to go after the escapees of Nanda Parbat, but Max thinks pursuing the murder is a better course.

===Invasion!===

Deadman is seen near the conclusion of [[Invasion (DC Comics)|Invasion!]] #2 (''Battleground: Earth!'') aboard the ship of the Khund commanding officer (whose body he had possessed). His contribution to the war effort was invaluable, as he assassinated the  leaders of the Alien Alliance, and sent a signal of surrender to both the Alliance and Earth-loyal forces (resulting in a cessation of hostilities).

===Youth and Hell===
In the "Sins of Youth" incident, Deadman is one of the dozens of heroes reduced to a preteen age by [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] and an alien machine owned by [[Doiby Dickles]]. He is still a spirit, now with a small ''d'' on his chest. He assists [[Secret (comics)|Secret]] in confronting Teekl, Klarion's companion, in an effort to restore everyone. He also joins in the fight against mystically created and mystically altered villains.

During the "[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]" incident, Boston Brand travels with a group of heroes to the frozen wastelands of Hell. Their goal is to restart the demonic fires, thus recalling all the demons from the earthly plane. An accident strands Brand and the others under the frozen waters of the [[Styx|River Styx]], forcing them to live out what would be to them, Hell. For Brand, it is that the sharpshooter hits him in the shoulder, thus he survives. Brand feels he needs to die in order to learn 'how to live'.

His battles against the demons would come back to haunt him. In the four part ''Black Baptism'' miniseries, Deadman and several other "[[Sentinels of Magic]]," the magical group formed out of the "Day of Judgment" incident, are hunted by the Diablos. Partly fueled by revenge, they subdue many of the Sentinels and drain their magic. The JLA eventually rescue them all and destroy all the Diablos.

===Blackest Night===
{{plot | date = November 2010}}
{{main|Blackest Night}}
In ''Blackest Night'' #2, Boston Brand begins to hear the voices of the dead and his own remains calling for him to protect them.<ref name="bn2">''Blackest Night'' #2 (August 2009)</ref> Being a spirit, he is unable to stop his body from being raised as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]. He attempts to possess his own body but is ejected after experiencing extreme physical and emotional pain during the attempt. He assists [[Dick Grayson|Batman]], [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] in repelling the invasion of the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (August 2009)</ref> Deadman manages to save [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] from the Black Lanterns by possessing the body of [[Barbara Gordon|his daughter]], spiriting them both to safety.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #2 (September 2009)</ref>
Deadman is later sent by Batman to possess the body of Jason Blood, invoking the power of [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]]. Deadman uses Etrigan's demon flame to hold back the Black Lanterns, but struggles to maintain control over the demon's body, finally being forced out. Deadman then frees Batman and Red Robin, who had frozen themselves to escape the Black Lanterns' onslaught.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (October 2009)</ref> He is later seen inside the Black Lantern [[Damage (comics)|Damage]]'s ring, apparently having followed [[Jean Loring]], [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] and [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|the Atom]] when they shrank down into it.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #49 (December 2009)</ref> He frees Mera and the Atom from Loring by briefly possessing her, allowing them time to return to normal size. During this incident he says he believes possessing the Black Lanterns causes him damage.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)</ref> He is later seen at Nanda Parbat, attempting to stop the Black Lanterns attempting to pass through the spiritual barrier by taking over their bodies and ripping them apart. He briefly loses himself to a Black Lantern's personality, but is saved by the [[Phantom Stranger]]. The Stranger convinces Deadman to enter his body again, telling them it is his destiny to bring it within Nanda Parbat. With the Stranger's help, Deadman is able to force the black ring off his body, bringing it through the gate of Parbat. The body, which the Stranger states is of "singular importance", is placed under the gatekeeper and [[Blue Devil]]'s protection, and Deadman heads out, intent on sharing the information he gleaned while inside the Black Lanterns with [[Hal Jordan]].<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #44 (January 2010)</ref> In the aftermath of the final battle, Deadman, wearing a [[White Lantern]] ring, is resurrected by power of the white light.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>

===Brightest Day===
{{plot | date = November 2010}}
{{main|Brightest Day}}
Boston goes to his own tombstone, demolishing it with a sledgehammer. Afterward, he picks up a bird that had died falling out of its nest, and his power ring restores it to life. Boston then hears a voice calling his name, and asking for his help. He then vanishes in a burst of white light. He then appears before the other eleven beings resurrected by the white light, completely invisible to them, and notices that he is the only one still wearing a white ring. He then appears in [[Star City]], where the white ring transforms the area devastated by [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]] into a lush forest. The voice again speaks to Boston asking him to "help them" to which Boston thinks to be the revived by the light, and to help it live.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref>

After witnessing Aquaman controlling dead sea creatures,<ref>''Brightest Day'' #1 (May 2010)</ref> Deadman is brought to the Anti-Matter universe by his ring, coming face-to-face with the [[Anti-Monitor]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #2 (May 2010)</ref> His ring then fights on its own, shooting out a white blast containing the shapes of all the resurrected heroes, which seems to damage the Anti-Monitor. He asks his ring if the purpose of everyone's resurrection was to defeat the Anti-Monitor to which is replies "No". Deadman's ring then does not shoot anymore and he is knocked back and begins to fall. As he falls he says he is not used to trying to stay alive, wondering if that was the point of his excursion, and asks the ring if the reason he was resurrected was to be given a second chance and to have a net next time he jumps into the air. He says he'll be more careful and to which the ring replies "Okay." Boston's ring then creates a net as he falls.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #3 (June 2010)</ref> After being transported out of the anti-matter universe, Boston is brought to [[Hawk and Dove|Dove]]'s room. He asks the ring who she is but suddenly becomes visible. Dove attacks him but he explains who he is. She says the Justice League is looking for him, to give him documentation that he was alive. He replies by saying "What if I don't want to live?" Hawk later crashes through the wall and attacks Deadman. Again, Deadman tells Hawk who he is. He explains what he knows about his ring and why he's alive. [[Hank Hall|Hawk]] takes Deadman to his brother's grave and says if a Black Lantern ring cannot resurrect his brother, why not a white one.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #4 (June 2010)</ref> Boston then attempts to bring back Don, with the white ring questioning his motives. After receiving backlash he tells Hank and Dawn that Don said he was at peace and not to worry about him. He then attempts to bring back Holly, Dawn's sister.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #5 (July 2010)</ref>

They are shown a horrific illusion of Holly rising as a Black Lantern, before realizing none of it is real. The voice guiding Deadman simply indicates death no longer holds the same meaning as before... and then recommends to him that he eat something, which makes him realize he hadn't eaten at all since his resurrection.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #6 (July 2010)</ref>

After eating a cheeseburger, Deadman, Hawk and Dove are brought to the White Lantern. Lifting it, Deadman asks the Entity why he was brought back. The Entity replies that it is dying, and it needs him to locate "the chosen one" that will take its place.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> He thought of Hal Jordan as the perfect candidate and as he told the Entity to take him to him.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #8 (August 2010)</ref>

Instead of taking him to Hal Jordan, the White Lantern Ring takes Deadman and Dove to [[Aquaman]] and [[Mera (comics)|Mera]]. Aquaman explains what the White Lantern told him, to find Jackson Hyde. Deadman questions why the Lantern took him to Aquaman when he could be searching for the Entity replacement. The ring replies that to find the new Entity Deadman must help all the other ressurectees complete their tasks. Aquaman understands what's at hand and explains to Deadman that for him to succeed he must find and help others and tell them what has to happen.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #9 (September 2010)</ref>

Deadman and Dove travel to Gotham City, where Dove shown him several pictures of heroes who may be or may not be perfect candidates to take the Entity's place.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #12 (October 2010)</ref> One of the heroes is the [[Resurrection Man]], however, Deadman tells them he isn't the chosen one since his ring has not made any movement. As Deadman asks the ring for what it's waiting for, the [[Bat-signal]] turns on. Looking to the signal, Deadman believes that [[Batman]] is the perfect candidate and that the ring was waiting for the recently returned [[Bruce Wayne]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #13 (November 2010)</ref> This theory ultimately proves to be false, as the ring rejects Batman, and after being shot by a criminal, it reveals that Boston is not meant to choose the ring's bearer, but to cross path with its future owner by fate, having been selected by the Entity to guide the ring as he is 'pure' from his death, untainted by the complexities that have been included in life over the centuries. As it heals Boston's wound, the ring also encourages the former ghost to embrace life, as Deadman realizes he now has a second chance as he never cared of anyone but himself in his previous life, only realising the value of others after he died. As Dove reveals her concerns after witnessing Deadman being shot, both of them realize that they are in love with each other and share a passionate kiss.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #14 (November 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a ghost, Deadman had the powers of intangibility, invisibility, and flight. He was also able to possess any sentient being.  The people he possessed retained no memory of the experience.

As a living human, he is an Olympic level athlete well-trained in acrobatics. As a wearer of a White Lantern ring he possesses whatever powers the ring confers upon its wielder. These powers, so far include flight, invisibility (or the ability to cloak his presence), teleportation, heal severe wounds, and the power to bring beings back to life. However, he currently appears to have no control over these new powers and the scope and limitations on those powers are as yet undefined.  His black power ring gave him the similar abilities, however it reanimates the dead instead of resurrecting them.

==Other versions==
*Deadman was in issue #6 of the comic book ''[[The Batman Adventures|Batman: Gotham Adventures]]'' (based on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'') where his origin was very much alike to his mainstream comic except he was in the Haley Circus and Rama Kushna was male. He was friends with [[Dick Grayson]], and he was in an issue before he gained his powers in ''The Batman and Robin Adventures'' #15.
*Deadman appeared twice briefly in [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]' [[Elseworlds]] story ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', first as an extra in a metahuman bar (Alongside [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], and [[Question (comics)|the Question]] where he offered some words of encouragement to [[Norman McCay]]. His appearance is notable because by the time of the story (set 10 years in the future) he has either lost or foregone his normal appearance, and appears as a skeleton wearing his Deadman uniform. He introduces himself as simply "Boston," and also appears in the sequel ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'' as a guide to time-lost, deceased versions of [[Superman]]. This version of Deadman was made into an action figure by [[DC Direct]] for Series 3 of their ''Kingdom Come'' line.<ref>[http://www.oafe.net/yo/dcdkc3dm.php DC Direct Kingdom Come: Deadman]</ref> Ross states that Brand's more skeletal appearance was a result of Brand accepting his role as a spirit.
*Deadman also appears in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s story ''[[The Books of Magic]]'', looking very similar to his appearance in ''Kingdom Come''. He possesses the body of several people throughout the comic, trying to warn Timothy Hunter about a coming danger.
*In 2006, [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] a DC Comics imprint, announced that it would trade some of its trademark characters with others of DC's. Among the swaps was Vertigo's [[Jonah Hex]] in exchange for Deadman. The result was [[Deadman (Vertigo)|a continuing series]] published later that year.
*Deadman also had a brief comic in the DC published book ''Bizarro World'' where he was interested in meeting girls and dating while in [[Limbo]].
*Deadman appeared briefly in Jeph Loeb's [[Superman/Batman|''Superman Batman: Absolute Power'']], where he attempted to possess Superman after he and Batman killed off all the monks of Nanda Parbat (under orders from their [[Legion of Super-Villains|adoptive parents]], who saw the monks as a threat to their plans in an alternate timeline). Deadman is prevented from using Superman's strength to kill Batman when Batman uses a spell from [[Zatanna]] to trap Deadman inside a crystal.
