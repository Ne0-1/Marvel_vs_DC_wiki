'''Deadman''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] in the anthology series, ''[[Strange Adventures]]''.  

He is a [[ghost]] who was formerly a [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] [[acrobatics|acrobat]] named Boston Brand who was murdered by a mysterious assailant.  His spirit was granted the power to [[possession|possess]] any living being by a [[god]] called Rama Kushna in order to search for his murderer.  However, Brand found himself feeling personally obliged to help others in addition to his search using his power to intervene more intimately what is normally possible.

The series, which was mixture of the [[TV series]], ''[[The Fugitive]]'' and a [[supernatural]] premise precursor to ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', was best known for the early work of [[Neal Adams]] whose naturalistic art style would soon deeply influence the medium.

While the initial series was short-lived, the character has become a popular supporting character who eventually found out the truth about his murder and came to accept and enjoy his role as an intervenor in mortal's lives.
