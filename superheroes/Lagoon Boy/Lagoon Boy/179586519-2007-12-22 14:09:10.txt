==Fictional character biography==
No writer has yet provided an origin story for Lagoon Boy. In his first appearance, he is allowed into Atlantis despite the protests of many elitist Atlanteans, due to an attempt by Aquaman to make [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] more open to citizens living outside the city, by granting them citizenship. Lagoon Boy comes to the citizenship ceremony on the day of [[Aquaman|King Orin]] and [[Mera (comics)|Queen Mera]]'s marriage. While there he befriends Blubber, a humanoid whale with a genius IQ and his assistant, Sheeva the Mermaid. ''Aquaman'' #54 reveals that the three characters have begun calling themselves "The Landlubbers". Blubber creates a device which allows Atlanteans to view television from the surface world, and the trio head up to the surface world in order to explore and compare it to the television broadcasts they had seen. Their appearance creates a huge disturbance and the [[Coast Guard]] is quickly called in. Aquaman rescues the Landlubbers from persecution and sends them back to Atlantis.

After Eric Larsen's run on Aquaman ended, the Landlubbers did not reappear in Aquaman. Lagoon Boy was used shortly before the end of Larsen's run by writer [[Chuck Dixon]], who wrote the ''Young Justice Special'' #1 [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]] story. In the story, the male members of Young Justice ([[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]), head for [[Gotham City]] and meet up with Lagoon Boy. They all team up to stop [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]]. Lagoon Boy reappears in ''Young Justice: Sins of Youth'', where he is aged to adulthood. He helps Young Justice face off against [[Klarion|Klarion the Witchboy]] and [[Black Manta]], and assists the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]], [[Justice League of America|JLA]] and [[Titans (comics)|the Titans]] endthe wild mixture of science and magic which had been causing the transformations..
