'''Lagoon Boy''' is a [[fictional character]] a [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Aquaman]]'' vol. 5 #50 (December 1998), and was created by [[Erik Larsen]] and Eric Battle.

==Fictional character biography==
No writer has yet provided an origin story for Lagoon Boy. In his first appearance, he is allowed into Atlantis despite the protests of many elitist Atlanteans. This is due to an attempt by Aquaman to make [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] more open to citizens living outside the city, by granting them citizenship. Lagoon Boy comes to the citizenship ceremony on the day of [[Aquaman|King Orin]] and [[Mera (comics)|Queen Mera]]'s marriage. While there he befriends Blubber, a humanoid whale with a genius IQ and his assistant, Sheeva the Mermaid. ''Aquaman'' #54 reveals that the three characters have begun calling themselves "The Landlubbers". Blubber creates a device which allows Atlanteans to view television from the surface world, and the trio head up to the surface world in order to explore and compare it to the television broadcasts they had seen. Their appearance creates a huge disturbance and the [[Coast Guard]] is quickly called in. Aquaman rescues the Landlubbers from persecution and sends them back to Atlantis.

After Erik Larsen's run on Aquaman ended, the Landlubbers did not reappear in Aquaman. Lagoon Boy was used shortly before the end of Larsen's run by writer [[Chuck Dixon]], who wrote the ''Young Justice Special'' #1 [[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]] story. In the story, the male members of Young Justice ([[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]), head for [[Gotham City]] and meet up with Lagoon Boy. They all team up to stop [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]]. Lagoon Boy reappears in ''Young Justice: Sins of Youth'', where he is aged to adulthood. He helps Young Justice face off against [[Klarion|Klarion the Witchboy]] and [[Black Manta]], and assists the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]], [[Justice League of America|JLA]] and [[Teen Titans|the Titans]] in ending the wild mixture of science and magic which had been causing the transformations..

Lagoon Boy later displays the ability to command, or at least enlist the aid of, [[humpback whale]]s in order to cause a riptide on the shores of the rogue nation of Zandia, aiding Young Justice in the process.<ref>''Young Justice'' #50</ref> Robin and Lagoon Boy team up to stop a [[sea monster]] from damaging ''Gotham Harbor'' and force its return to the sea.<ref>''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' #83-#84</ref> Lagoon Boy was briefly shown in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as [[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]] wreaks havoc on the people of Atlantis. He is shown fighting the Spectre alongside many Atlanteans and their allies. Lagoon Boy is one of the few survivors after the Spectre squashes the city. <ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #4</ref>. 

Over a year after Young Justice disbands, Lagoon Boy is recruited alongside several other obscure teenaged heroes as part of a [[Teen Titans]] spin-off team known as the [[Titans East]]. Unforunately, he and the rest of the Titans are severely injured after being attacked by the children of [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] on a routine training exercise.<ref>''Titans East Special''</ref>

In a scene taking place just hours prior to the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Lagoon Boy's former teammate [[Hawk and Dove|Hawk]] II visits [[Titans Tower]] and angrily tells [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] that Lagoon Boy is still in a coma.<ref>''Titans'' (Volume 2) #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lagoon Boy is an amphibious boy. He is small in stature, but  stronger, quicker and more durable than an ordinary human. His body is covered in green scales and fins, as well as sharp claws and teeth. When excited, Lagoon Boy also has the ability to blow up like a [[puffer fish]], which makes him appear to be much larger and more intimidating, and develops quills that can cause great pain to other opponents who cross his path. 

Lagoon Boy discovers a conch horn that allows him to call out to his pet Spotty, a monstrous animal from the undersea trench called the ''Devil's Deep''. Lagoon Boy has also displayed the ability to command [[humpback whale]]s. At this point, it is unclear just how much control he has over them. 

While not a superpower per se, he also has access to wealth acquired from submerged ships and cities.<ref>''Aquaman'' #54</ref>

==Other versions==
Lagoon Boy appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #52 as an alternate alias of [[Dial H for Hero|Robby Reed]]. Unknown to both Robby and the Titans, his H-Dial borrows power from any hero who's in close proximity to him, and thus becomes Lagoon Boy when [[Aqualad]] is close by.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Lagoon Boy appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Downtime" voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]] who was uncredited for the role. He is shown as a student at the Conservatory of Sorcery alongside [[Lori Lemaris]].
