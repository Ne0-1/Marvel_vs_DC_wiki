'''Lagoon Boy''' was created by [[Erik Larsen]] and Eric Battle in the pages of [[Aquaman]] back in Aquaman #50 back in 1998.

==Physical appearance and powers==
Lagoon Boy is an [[amphibious]] boy.  He is small in stature, but appears to be stronger, quicker and more durable (judging by the [[Young Justice]] No Man's Land story in which [[Kobra]] attacks him with a [[torpedo]] and he appears a little sore from the attack) than an ordinary human.  His body is covered in green scales and fins, as well as sharp claws and teeth. 

When excited, Lagoon Boy also seems to have the ability to blow up like a [[puffer fish]], which makes him appear to be much larger and more intimidating, and develops quills that can cause great pain to other opponents who cross his path. He also possesses a [[conch]] horn which allows him to have contact with other beings of the ocean; at this point it is unclear just how much control he has over the beings he summons. He also appears to have knowledge of acquiring wealth from sunken treasures to afford things from the surface world some would say is priceless (as shown back in Aquaman #54).

==History==
Lagoon Boy has no origin, no one knows where he came from and he isn't telling as of yet. In Aquaman #50, despite the protests of many racist and elitist Atlanteans, Aquaman was furthering his attempts to make [[Atlantis]] more open to citizens living beyond its undersea kingdom and allowing them citizenship as Atlanteans. Lagoon Boy came to the ceremony also on the same day celebrating [[King Orin]] and [[Queen Mera]]'s marriage. There he soon befriended a whale named Blubber, a gigantic whale with a genius IQ and his assistant, the beautiful Sheeva the Mermaid.

By Aquaman #54, these three had called themselves "The Landlubbers," and since all had abilities to survive above the waters, they headed into unknown territory of the surface world to see if it was all they had seen it to be from their limited view of it on [[television]]. They created a huge disturbance and the [[coast guard]] was quickly called in. Aquaman ended up rescuing the Landlubbers from persecution and sent them back to Atlantis. This was also a time when the people of Atlantis were not terribly accepting of any of the three kids. Blubber also created a device which also allowed the people to view television from the surface world and this seemed to have granted the kids a little better acceptance from their adopted city.

==Later appearances==
After Larsen's ill fated run on Aquaman and due to the huge drop in sales, the next writer [[Dan Jurgens]] completely ignored that the Landlubbers existed. The only other time Lagoon Boy was used was shortly towards the end of Eric Larsen's run when comic book writer [[Chuck Dixon]] wrote in a story in the Young Justice Special #1 No Man's Land story, in which the boys of Young Justice break into [[Gotham City]] (Superboy, Robin and Impulse) and meet Lagoon Boy, as they and his friend team up to stop the invasion of the terrorist group called Kobra from invading the abandoned city. Chuck Dixon has openly stated on the internet he loved the character Lagoon Boy because he heard from Eric Larsen he based his appearance on the monster from the films titled, [[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]].

Lagoon Boy also showed up during the Young Justice:Sins of Youth story, in which he was aged to adulthood while Aquaman was forced to become a kid again and they faced off against Klarion the Witchboy, and Black Manta and helped the JSA, JLA, the Titans and Young Justice from stopping the mixture of science and magic that caused like transformations of most of the characters in the story.

Chuck Dixon also managed to throw in a Lagoon Boy story in the pages of Robin. In Robin #83 and #84, Lagoon Boy discovers a conch horn that allows him to call out to his pet Spotty a monstrous animal from the undersea trench called the Devil's Deep. Unfortunately, he doesn't realise it also calls out to another monster who ends up coming to the surface and wreaking havoc upon Gotham harbour, causing Robin and Lagoon Boy to team up and stop the monster from hurting any citizens and returning to the sea.

Lagoon Boy showed up in Young Justice #50 in which he somehow has the ability to command large humpback whales to cause a riptide on the shores of the nation called Zandia to aid Young Justice in the capture of its evil dictator.

Lagoon Boy was last shown in Infinite Crisis #4 in which the Spectre wreaks havoc on the people of Atlantis and he was shown fighting the Spectre along many colleagues who appeared to have died in the conflict. His fate is still unknown at this point.
