'''Darkdevil''' ('''Reilly Tyne''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the "[[MC2]]" future of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Pat Olliffe]] and first appeared in ''Spider-Girl'' #2.

==Fictional character biography==
Reilly Tyne is the son of [[Ben Reilly]], the clone of [[Spider-Man]], and Elizabeth Tyne.  Before he reached his teens, his inherited powers began to kick in, but brought with them clonal degeneration.  [[Kaine]], the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a regeneration tank to slow the process.  Trying to kill two birds with one stone, and resurrect [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] - who had previously died saving Kaine - while healing Tyne, he summoned the demon [[Zarathos]].  Zarathos attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities.

Through meditation and concentration, he eventually learned to project a human appearance - but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age.  Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil.  He apparently has access to at least some of Daredevil's memories, since he knows Spider-Man's secret identity.

Darkdevil has fought alongside [[Spider-Girl]] several times, as well as the semi-retired Spider-Man.  Neither Spider-Man nor Spider-Girl are aware of his genetic relation to them, but Darkdevil has hinted that he owes his existence to the original Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Kaine.<ref>''Spider-Girl #17''</ref> [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] noticed Reilly at [[Normie Osborn|Normie]] and [[Raptor (comics)|Brenda's]] wedding party and attempted to point out to her husband the boy that resembled him.  [[Spider-man|Peter Parker]] cluelessly mentions that Reilly resembles [[Tobey Maguire]]<ref>''Spider-Girl #82''</ref>, a sly nod to the [[Spider-Man films]].

When Doc Magus, [[Sorcerer Supreme]] (successor to [[Doctor Strange]]), delved into Darkdevil's mind, he found it had three inhabitants: Reilly himself as a young teen, Daredevil, and Zarathos in the form of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].

==Powers==
Darkdevil has superhuman strength and agility, similar sense to Spider-Man’s spider-sense, able to teleport, change his appearance from demon to human and manifest flaming constructs, such as billy clubs.
