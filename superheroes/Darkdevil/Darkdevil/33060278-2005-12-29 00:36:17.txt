==Character biography==
Reilly Tyne is the son of [[Ben Reilly]], the clone of [[Spider-Man]]. Before he reached his teens, his inherited powers began to kick in, but brought with them clone degeneration. [[Kaine]], the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a regeneration tank to slow the process.  Trying to kill two birds with one stone, and resurrect [[Daredevil]] - who had previously died saving Kaine - while healing Tyne, he summoned the demon [[Zarathos]].  Zarathos attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities.

Through meditation and concentration, he eventually learned to project a human appearance - but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age.  Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil.
