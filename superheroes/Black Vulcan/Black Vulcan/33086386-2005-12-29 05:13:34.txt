'''Black Vulcan''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[African American]] superhero on the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' created by [[Hanna-Barbera]].  He was voiced by [[Buster Jones]].

== Character history ==
Unlike most of the Super Friends, Black Vulcan was not a pre-existing [[DC Comics]] character. This is particularly notable since DC Comics' roster did include an African American superhero with electricity-based powers, [[Black Lightning]]. Black Lightning could not be used in the show, however, due to disputes between DC Comics and [[Tony Isabella]], the creator and owner of the character.

Originally introduced as a way to add more a culturally diverse roster to the team in the ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' series, Black Vulcan was the Super Friends' resident black superhero, although his character mostly refrains from being seen as a harsh stereotype (unlike other [[affirmative action]] members like [[Apache Chief]] and [[Samurai (superhero)|Samurai]]).  His origin and background are very similar to the character he is based on, and some fans speculate if he and Black Lightning are actually one and the same, albeit at different periods in his life.

His powers include the ability to emit electricity from his hands, as well as fly by charging his lower body with energy.  On a few occasions he exhibited powers he hadn't before, such as the ability to assume a form of pure energy and travel at the speed of light (in an attempt to escape a black hole, which of course, isn't possible as not even light can pass through one).  He was even able to travel back in time by flucuating his body's energy in such a way that it opened a rift in space.  

In the final incarnation of the series, ''Super Powers: Galactic Guardians'', he was replaced with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], another African American superhero that was already well established in the [[DC Comics]] lineup.

== In other media ==
Black Vulcan has made several appearances on the show ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'', debuting in the season one episode, "Very Personal Injury".  Since then he has had somewhat of a supporting role in the series if only to utter the prepositional phrase "...in your pants." or "...in my pants."  He also gives advice to the character Peanut as he goes through superhero puberty and acquires his powers. Apparently he used to go by the name of Supervolt before [[Aquaman]] suggested his present name, to which Black Vulcan responds that maybe they should just call Aquaman "White Fish".  In this series he is voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].

== Trivia ==
*The character [[Juice (JLUTV)|Juice]] from ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'s''  [[The Ultimen]] is directly based on Black Vulcan.
*In the first episode of the series ''[[Static Shock]]'', one of the outfits Virgil tries on when he's picking out his superhero costume is an exact duplicate of Black Vulcan's.
