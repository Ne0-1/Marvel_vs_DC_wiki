'''Black Vulcan''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[African American]] superhero on the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' created by [[Hanna-Barbera]].  He was voiced by [[Buster Jones]].

== Character history ==
Unlike most of the Super Friends, Black Vulcan was not a pre-existing [[DC Comics]] character. This is particularly notable since DC Comics' roster did include an African American superhero with electricity-based powers, [[Black Lightning]] (apparently, Lightning could not be used on the show due to disputes between DC and Lightnings's creator [[Tony Isabella]]<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003717774.cfm LIGHTNING ROD How Black Lightning hurdled racism, knockoffs and wars between creators to become the new powerhouse of ''Justice League of America''] By Ben Morse Posted March 3, 2007</ref>) . 

Originally introduced as a way to add more a culturally diverse roster to the team in the ''[[All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' series, Black Vulcan was the Super Friends' resident black superhero, although his character mostly refrains from being seen as a harsh stereotype. Curiously, as originally depicted, Black Vulcan's costume had the super-hero equivalent of pants -- but in later episodes -- they were absent. No explanation or even notice of this dramatic change was ever given.

His powers include the ability to emit electricity from his hands, as well as fly by charging his lower body with energy. On a few occasions, he exhibited powers he had not before, such as the ability to assume a form of pure energy and travel at the speed of light (in an attempt to escape a [[black hole]], which, according to theory, is a feat not even light is able to accomplish). He was even able to [[Time travel|travel back in time]] by fluctuating his body's energy in such a way that it opened a rift in space.  

In the final incarnation of the series, ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', he was replaced with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], another black superhero that was already well established in the [[DC Comics]] lineup, and possessed a more developed personality.

==Other versions==
The character [[Juice (Justice League Unlimited)|Juice]] from ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'s''  [[The Ultimen]] is directly based on Black Vulcan.

==In other media==
===Harvey Birdman===
Black Vulcan has made several appearances on the show ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'', debuting in the season one episode, "Very Personal Injury".  Since then he has had somewhat of a supporting role in the series if only to utter the prepositional phrase "...in your pants." or "...in my pants."  He also gives advice to the character Peanut as he goes through superhero puberty and acquires his powers. In the episode "Booty Noir" he has a ''[[menage a trois]]'' with his ex-girlfriend Norlissa and Reducto. Apparently he used to go by the name of Super Volt before [[Aquaman]] suggested his present name, to which Black Vulcan responds that maybe they should just call Aquaman "[[Whitefish|White Fish]]".  In this series he is voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].

===Static Shock===
In the first episode of the series ''[[Static Shock]]'', one of the outfits Virgil tries on when he's picking out his superhero costume is a copy of Black Vulcan's with pants.
