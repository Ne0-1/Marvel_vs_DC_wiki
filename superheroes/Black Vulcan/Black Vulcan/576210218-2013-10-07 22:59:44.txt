'''Black Vulcan''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] on the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' created by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. 
He was voiced by [[Buster Jones]].

==Fictional character biography==
Unlike most of the Super Friends, Black Vulcan was not a pre-existing [[DC Comics]] character. This is particularly notable since DC Comics' roster did include an African American superhero with electricity-based powers, [[Black Lightning]], who could not be used on the show due to disputes between DC and Black Lightning's creator [[Tony Isabella]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080111224227/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003717774.cfm LIGHTNING ROD How Black Lightning hurdled racism, knockoffs and wars between creators to become the new powerhouse of ''Justice League of America''] By Ben Morse Posted March 3, 2007</ref>

Black Vulcan appeared in the ''[[All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' cartoon series. 

His powers include the ability to emit electricity from his hands.  He can also fly by charging his lower body with energy.

On a few occasions, he exhibited powers he had not shown before, such as the ability to assume a form of pure energy and travel at the speed of light (in an unsuccessful attempt to escape a [[black hole]],<ref>Challenge of the Superfriends Episode: The World's Deadliest Game, Pt. 1, September 23, 1978, YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCb6-RjX8sw 5:05 to 5:11</ref>).

==In other media==
===Television===
* Black Vulcan made several appearances on the show ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. He debuted in the season one episode, "Very Personal Injury", in which he was present at the trial when Apache Chief sued a coffee shop. In the episode, he describes his power as "Pure electricityâ€¦in my pants." This becomes a running gag; whenever someone makes a double entendre, he utters some variation on "...in my pants." He claims that he previously used the name "Super Volt" before [[Aquaman]] suggested his present name, which Black Vulcan believes is a racist slur. Black Vulcan suggests that Aquaman should therefore be called "White Fish". At the end of the episode, Black Vulcan and Apache Chief form "The Multicultural Pals" with other superheroes of color and Jesse Jackson. In "Peanut Puberty", Black Vulcan gives advice to the character Peanut as he goes through superhero puberty and acquires his powers. In the episode "Booty Noir" he has a ''[[menage a trois]]'' with his ex-girlfriend Norlissa and Reducto.

* In the first episode of the series ''[[Static Shock]]'', one of the outfits [[Static (DC Comics)|Virgil]] considers as his superhero costume resembles Black Vulcan's but includes pants. [[Gear (Static Shock)|Richie]] rejects it, saying the outfit makes him look like "a battery commercial".

* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the character '''Juice''' is based on Black Vulcan and is a member of the [[Ultimen]]. He has the ability to emit [[electricity]] from his body, which he can use to create small electric bursts or fly by charging his lower body with energy. He can assume an electric form which he can use to travel quickly and discreetly. Juice rarely speaks, but when he does his voice sounds raspy and broken up, like a low-quality speaker or radio.<ref name=ult>"Ultimatum", season one, ''Justice League Unlimited''</ref> After Maxwell Lord reveals their true origins and short life expectancies, Juice shocked Maxwell Lord when he offered to help the Ultimen. The Ultimen battled the [[Justice League]] in a desperate plan by Wind Dragon. Juice battled [[Batman]] and was defeated when Batman knocked him into some water pipes that shorted out his power supply. Juice is now imprisoned like most of the other Ultimen, their bodies still deteriorating.<ref name=ult /> An army of Ultimen clones were later created by [[Project Cadmus]] in an attempt to finish off the Justice League. They were eventually defeated.<ref>"Panic In The Sky", season one, ''Justice League Unlimited''</ref>

* The Black Vulcan outfit can be seen in the background for the teaser trailer for Black Lightning's upcoming ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]''.  The episode conflates Black Lightning with the characters Thunder and Lightning.

* Black Vulcan was combined with [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' as part of the show's group of teen ''Super Friends'' analogues.<ref>http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=18430</ref>

*Black Vulcan makes a cameo in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'' along with the other Super Friends.

===Comics===
Noted comic book artist and self-professed ''Super Friends'' fan [[Alex Ross (comic illustrator)|Alex Ross]] intended to create a modernized version of Black Vulcan for his rejected [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] series. The title would have had the character reimagined as '''Vulcan''', an African American child who could become an adult superhero after accidentally gaining some of the powers of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]].<ref> http://www.newsarama.com/comics/oral-history-captain-marvel-101-110106.html</ref>
