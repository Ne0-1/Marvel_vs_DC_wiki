'''Black Vulcan''' was a [[fictional character]] on the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]''.

Along with [[Apache Chief]], he was introduced in an effort to make the show more [[multicultural]], an attempt that was not generally regarded as successful.

His superhuman powers included the ability to fire [[electricity]] from his body, fashion cages for enemies out of electricity, and use electricity to fly.

Unlike most of the Super Friends, Black Vulcan was not a pre-existing [[DC Comics]] character. This is particularly notable since DC Comics' roster did include an African-American [[superhero]] with electricity-based powers ([[Black Lightning]]) and it is not clear why the makers of the show went to the trouble of creating a new character who was, at least initially, practically indistinguishable from one that already existed.
