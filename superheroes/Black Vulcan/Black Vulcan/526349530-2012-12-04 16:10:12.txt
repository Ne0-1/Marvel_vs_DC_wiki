'''Black Vulcan''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] on the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' created by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. 
He was voiced by [[Buster Jones]].

==Fictional character biography==
Unlike most of the Super Friends, Black Vulcan was not a pre-existing [[DC Comics]] character. This is particularly notable since DC Comics' roster did include an African American superhero with electricity-based powers, [[Black Lightning]], who could not be used on the show due to disputes between DC and Black Lightning's creator [[Tony Isabella]].<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003717774.cfm LIGHTNING ROD How Black Lightning hurdled racism, knockoffs and wars between creators to become the new powerhouse of ''Justice League of America''] By Ben Morse Posted March 3, 2007</ref>{{dead link|date=December 2011}} 

Black Vulcan appeared in the ''[[All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' cartoon series. 

His powers include the ability to emit electricity from his hands, as well as fly by charging his lower body with energy.

On a few occasions, he exhibited powers he had not shown before, such as the ability to assume a form of pure energy and travel at the speed of light (in an unsuccessful attempt to escape a [[black hole]],<ref>Challenge of the Superfriends Episode: The World's Deadliest Game, Pt. 1, September 23, 1978, YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCb6-RjX8sw 5:05 to 5:11</ref> which, according to theory, is a feat not even light is able to accomplish once it has passed inside the [[event horizon]]). He was even able to [[Time travel|travel back in time]]<ref>Challenge of the Superfriends Episode: Secret Origins of the Superfriends, Pt. 2, October 28, 1978, YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsK2Lj6IgYQ&feature=PlayList&p=08F43B2EE17BE792&playnext=1&playnext_from=PL&index=17  4:11</ref> by fluctuating his body's energy in such a way that it opened a rift in space-time. Finally, Black Vulcan is able to spot-weld microelectronics.<ref>World's Greatest Superfriends Episode: Dive to Disaster, Pt. 3, YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JmiBJWoykw  1:24</ref>

In the final incarnation of the series, ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', he was replaced with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], another black superhero that was already well established in the [[DC Comics]] lineup and possessed a more developed personality.

==Other versions==
'''Juice''' is a [[fiction]]al character featured in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and is a member of the [[Ultimen]]. He has the ability to emit [[electricity]] from his body, which he can use to create small electric bursts or even fly by charging his lower body with energy. He can even assume an electric form which he can use to travel quickly and discreetly. Undoubtedly the most softspoken member of the Ultimen, Juice rarely speaks, but when he does his voice sounds raspy and broken up, like a low-quality speaker or radio.<ref name=ult>"Ultimatum", season one, ''Justice League Unlimited''</ref> He was voiced by an uncredited [[CCH Pounder]]. 

After discovering their true origins and short life expectancies, the Ultimen battled the [[Justice League]] in a desperate plan by [[Wind Dragon]]. Juice battled [[Batman]] and was defeated when Batman knocked him into some water pipes that shorted out his power supply. Juice is now locked up like most of the other Ultimen, with their bodies still deteriorating.<ref name=ult />

An army of Ultimen clones were later created by [[Project Cadmus]] in an attempt to finish off the Justice League once and for all. They were eventually defeated.<ref>"Panic In The Sky", season one, ''Justice League Unlimited''</ref>

==In other media==
===''Harvey Birdman''===
Black Vulcan has made several appearances on the show ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. He debuted in the season one episode, "Very Personal Injury". In the episode, he describes his power as "Pure electricity…in my pants". This becomes a running gag: whenever someone makes a double entendre, he will often appear to utter some variation on "...in my pants." He also gives advice to the character Peanut as he goes through superhero puberty and acquires his powers. In the episode "Booty Noir" he has a ''[[menage a trois]]'' with his ex-girlfriend Norlissa and Reducto. It is said that he used to go by the name of Super Volt before [[Aquaman]] suggested his present name, which Black Vulcan believes is due to racism; Black Vulcan responds that maybe they should just call Aquaman "White Fish".

===Toys===
Black Vulcan has been released in a ''Justice League Unlimited'' three-pack, accompanied by his Super Friends teammates [[Apache Chief]] and [[Samurai (comics)|Samurai]]. A 6" Black Vulcan action figure was released in [[Mattel]]'s [[DC Universe Classics]] Wave 18, which was primarily dedicated to Super Friends characters.<ref>[http://www.oafe.net/yo/dcuc18_bv.php OAFE - DC Universe Classics 18: Black Vulcan review]</ref>

===''Static Shock''===
In the first episode of the series ''[[Static Shock]]'', one of the outfits [[Static (DC Comics)|Virgil]] tries on when he's picking out his superhero costume is a copy of Black Vulcan's with pants. ([[Gear (Static Shock)|Richie]] rejects it, saying the outfit makes him look like a battery commercial.)

===Comics===
Noted comic book artist and self-professed ''Super Friends'' fan [[Alex Ross (comic illustrator)|Alex Ross]] intended to create a modernized version of Black Vulcan for his rejected [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] series. The title would have had the character reimagined as '''Vulcan''', an African American child who could become an adult superhero after accidentally gaining some of the powers of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]].<ref> http://www.newsarama.com/comics/oral-history-captain-marvel-101-110106.html</ref>

Black Vulcan made a cameo appearance in the ''[[DC One Million]] 80-Page Giant'' special as part of one of the many alternate Justice Leagues that accidentally ended up in the headquarters of the [[Justice Legion Alpha]].
