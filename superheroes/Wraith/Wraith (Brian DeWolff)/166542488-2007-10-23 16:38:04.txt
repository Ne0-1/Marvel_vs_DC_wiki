The '''Wraith''' is a [[fictional character]], owned by [[Marvel Comics]] and existing in that company's [[Marvel Universe]]. The character was first introduced as '''Brian DeWolff''', the brother of [[Spider-Man]] supporting character, [[Jean DeWolff]].

==Fictional character biography==
Brian DeWolff was a former patrolman for the New York Police Department, who was shot by criminals and rescued by his father, using experimental technologies to restore Brian's health.  This process gave Brian psionic abilities, including the ability to read minds, induce illusions in the minds of others, project psionic force bolts and control the mind of another person (but he can only control one mind at a time), but left him with no mind of his own and succeptable to the mental domination of others. Under his father Phillip's control, Brian (as the Wraith) killed several criminals, and fought Spider-Man, [[Iron Man]], and [[Doctor Strange]].  Finally overpowered and the true circumstances revealed, Brian regained his independent will and was found innocent of the crimes and his father went to prison.  The Wraith became a costumed adventurer and acted as an ally of Iron Man.

When his sister Jean was killed by the [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] (who was also a policeman, much like Brian), the Wraith went mad and decided to take vengeance on the whole New York Police Department.  When he arrived at a police station, he was shot by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who was disguised as a policeman.

His original form was destroyed, but he later transferred his mind into the body of another.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
