'''Lara Lor-Van''', usually referred to as '''Lara''', is a [[fictional character]] who appeared in [[Superman]] comics published by [[DC Comics]]. Lara is the biological mother of Superman, and the wife of scientist [[Jor-El]].

Lara's role in the Superman mythos has varied over the years, with her treatment and emphasis often depending on the decade she was written in. Earlier stories treated Lara in a lesser role compared to her scientist husband; however, stories from the 1970s onwards depict Lara in more prominent roles, with the 2004 miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' as an example of this.

Lara is usually referred to only by her first name. Most depictions of Kryptonian culture show that females use their father's full name as their last names before marriage, and usually use just their first names after marriage. Thus, "Lara Lor-Van" was Lara's full [[maiden name]], as "Lor-Van" is the name of Lara's father.

After constructing his [[Fortress of Solitude]], Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a [[globe]] of their native planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].

==History==
Lara was first referred to in the Superman [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] in 1939, where her name was spelled as "Lora"; her name first appeared as being spelled "Lara" in a 1942 Superman novel.

A 1948 retelling of Superman's origin story first delved into detail about Lara, though her formal and more familiar [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades, with a definitive summarization in the 1979 miniseries ''The World of Krypton'' (not to be confused with the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late 1980s comic special of the same name).

As it was summarized in this miniseries (and in various other Silver Age stories), Lara was an [[astronaut]] in Krypton's space program. On Krypton, it was deemed that women were more suitable for astronauts than men; however, Krypton's space program was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons. Eventually, Lara met scientist Jor-El, with the two having several adventures together before getting married. Some time later, Lara gave birth to the couple's only child, Kal-El.

When Krypton was about to explode, Lara and Jor-El placed their infant son into an escape rocket built by Jor-El. In earlier versions of the story, Jor-El wanted Lara to accompany their son to [[Earth]], but Lara refused, saying their son would have a better chance of reaching Earth without her extra weight. Kal-El's spaceship then took off, leaving Lara and Jor-El to perish.

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''The Man of Steel'' rewrote Superman's origins, details about Lara's background and character were changed. Under Byrne's version, Lara inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Jor-El was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing emotions toward his wife Lara, and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. In this version of the mythos, Lara was a [[librarian]] and historian of high rank, and thought it horrifying that Kal-El would be sent to a "primitive" planet such as Earth (and was turned off by Jor-El's expression of affection toward her).  Her grandmother Lady Nara and Seyg-El, Jor-El's father, were the ones who arranged the union between them &ndash; so that they might have a child who would fill an opening in the planet's Register of Citizens when an unnamed Kryptonian died a rare and untimely death.

In the 2004 Superman miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Lara, along with Krypton and Jor-El, were more-or-less reverted back to their Silver Age versions, though with updated touches. In this version, Lara is treated as a fully equal partner to Jor-El in constructing Kal-El's spacecraft, designing various key components.

==In other media==
Lara has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the Superman story. However, as was the case in the older comics, Lara usually has a less prominent role than Jor-El in such depictions.

Lara was played by [[Susannah York]] in ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'', ''[[Superman II]]'' and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest For Peace]]'' (voice only).

In the 1990s [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Finola Hughes]] provided Lara's voice.  Lara's father in this series, a member of the Science Council, was named "Sul-Van."  Thus, her full name in the series was "Lara Sul-Van."
