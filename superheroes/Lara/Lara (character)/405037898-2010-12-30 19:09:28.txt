'''Lara''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in [[Superman]] comics published by [[DC Comics]]. Lara is the biological mother of Superman, and the wife of scientist [[Jor-El]]. '''Lara Lor-Van''' was Lara's full [[maiden name]], as "Lor-Van" is the name of Lara's father. Most depictions of Kryptonian culture show that females use their father's full name as their last names before marriage, and then are known simply by their first names after marriage.

Lara's role in the Superman mythos has varied over the years, with her treatment and emphasis often depending on the decade she was written in. Earlier stories treated Lara in a lesser role compared to her scientist husband; however, stories from the 1970s onwards depict Lara in more prominent roles, with the 2004 miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' as an example of this.

After constructing his [[Fortress of Solitude]], Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a [[globe]] of their native planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].

==Fictional character biography==


A 1948 retelling of Superman's origin story first delved into detail about Lara, though her formal and more familiar [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades, with a definitive synopsis in the 1979 miniseries ''The World of Krypton'' (not to be confused with the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late 1980s comic special of the same name).

In virtually all depictions up to ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'' in 1978, Lara was portrayed as black-haired. Since then, she has been variously depicted as black-haired or auburn/blonde-haired, as portrayed by [[Susannah York]].

As summarized in this miniseries (and in various other Silver Age stories), Lara was an [[astronaut]] in Krypton's space program. On Krypton, it was deemed that women were more suitable for astronauts than men; however, Krypton's space program was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons. Eventually, Lara met scientist Jor-El, with the two having several adventures together before getting married. Some time later, Lara gave birth to the couple's only child, Kal-El.

When Krypton was about to explode, Lara and Jor-El placed their infant son into an escape rocket built by Jor-El. In earlier versions of the story, Jor-El wanted Lara to accompany their son to [[Earth]], but Lara refused, saying their son would have a better chance of reaching Earth without her extra weight. Kal-El's spaceship then took off, leaving Lara and Jor-El to perish.

===Modern Age versions===
After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''The Man of Steel'' rewrote Superman's origins, details about Lara's background and character were changed. Under Byrne's version, Lara inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Jor-El was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing emotions toward his wife Lara, and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. In this version of the mythos, Lara was a [[librarian]] and historian of high rank, and thought it horrifying that Kal-El would be sent to a "primitive" planet such as Earth (and was repelled by Jor-El's expression of affection toward her).  Her grandmother Lady Nara and Seyg-El, Jor-El's father, were the ones who arranged the union between them &ndash; so that they might have a child who would fill an opening in the planet's Register of Citizens when another Kryptonian died a rare and untimely death.

In the 2004 Superman miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Lara, along with Krypton and Jor-El, more or less again became their Silver Age versions, though with updated touches. In this version, Lara is treated as a fully equal partner to Jor-El in constructing Kal-El's spacecraft and in designing various key components.

In the 2009 series ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'' by Geoff Johns, Superman is first introduced to his birth mother in his teens by the spaceship that brought him to the Earth as a baby. She is introduced to Kal-El by a hologram of Jor-El as his mother. This moment shocks Superman and brings tears to Martha Kent's eyes.

Also in 2009, Lara's own family background is described. Lara Lor-Van is born into the Labor Guild, an almost slave labor caste in Krypton, whose members are not physically abused but have no say in the choices of their lives and who, unlike the members of other guilds, cannot change guilds. Lara became a member of her husband's Science Guild when she married him and was thereby granted all the freedoms granted to other Science Guild members. A member of Krypton's Military Guild describes this as being "raised up."

==Other versions==
* In Frank Miller's mini-series ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' (also referred to as DK2), '''Lara''' is the name of the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, with the powers of a Kryptonian and the warrior attitude of an Amazon. She has a poor opinion of people less powerful than herself and tries to persuade her father to rise above the "humans" and maybe even take over the world. He himself is torn between this and his adopted parent's view that he should use his powers to help rather than to dominate. Ultimately, he rejects the former option and reconciles with Batman.

==In other media==
Lara has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the Superman story. However, as was the case in the older comics, Lara usually has a less prominent role than Jor-El in such depictions.

===Television===
* In 1952, Lara was portrayed by [[Aline Towne]] in "Superman on Earth", the premiere episode of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''.

* In the ''[[Super Friends]]'' episode called "The Planet Splitter," she was featured in a flashback.

* Lara was also in the ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' episode "Secret Origins of the Super Friends."

* In 1996, Lara's voice was provided by [[Finola Hughes]] in "The Last Son of Krypton", the premiere episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. She is depicted with elements of her Silver Age and Modern Age selves, where she is headstrong and an equal partner to Jor-El, but instead of being a scientist she is an artist. She also sports the forehead hair curl that has become a characteristic trait of Superman's physical appearance.

* Lara made a cameo with Jor-El in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Twilight".

* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series episode entitled "For the Man Who Has Everything", Superman's imagined son is named Van, a nod to Lara's father, who in the animated series is named Sul-Van (rather than Lor-Van).

* Lara has appeared in one episode of Season 3 in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', played by [[Kendall Cross (actress)|Kendall Cross]]. Clark was dipped in a tank of kryptonite enhanced liquid used to induce repressed memories to come to surface. His mother placed baby Kal-El into the rocket which will take him to Earth. While Jor-El was more concerned about his son fulfilling his destiny, Lara was worried no one would love him. Clark came out of his fugue screaming her name, leaving him with the reassurance that his mother had loved him (As opposed to Jor-El's apparently heartless manipulation of him, although his intentions were later confirmed to be benevolent), Martha Kent subsequently telling him "Lara" was his first word, but she and Jonathan never knew what it meant. In the episode named "Lara" of season 7, it is revealed that Lara, now played by ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]'' actress [[Helen Slater]], visited the Kent farm prior to the destruction of Krypton. Along with Kara, they hide a photograph of Lara so that Kal-El will find it. It is also noted in this episode that Lara's DNA was hidden in the blue crystal by her brother-in-law [[Zor-El]]. Pictures of Lara from this episode can be found here <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/laragallery1.htm |title=Smallville "Lara" Image Gallery - with Helen Slater! |publisher=Kryptonsite.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>. In the episode "Blue" Lara and Zor-El are released onto Earth in corporeal form (although technically not alive). The story culminates in Clark's destruction of the crystal to rid the world of Zor-El. Although upset to again lose his mother, with her assurance that she loves him, he is able to in order to save Kara's life. The naming conventions in ''Smallville'' seem to differ from the comic book continuity. Kara refers to Lara as Lara-El at the start of the episode of "Blue." This means that females, on ''Smallville'', take their husband's last name and attach to their first.

* Lara appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Especially the Animal Keith Crofford" voiced by [[Vanessa Hudgens]].

===''Film''===
Lara was played by [[Susannah York]] in ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' ([[1978 in film|1978]]), ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]])and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]) (voice only). After [[Marlon Brando]] ([[Jor-El]]) was removed from ''[[Superman II]]'', Lara took on the role as Superman's mentor, in both ''Superman II'' and ''IV''. She was later replaced by Brando's Jor-El in ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', the [[2006 in film|2006]] edit of ''Superman II''.
