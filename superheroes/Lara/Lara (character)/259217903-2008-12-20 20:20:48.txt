'''Lara Lor-Van''', usually referred to as simply '''Lara''', is a [[fictional character]] who appears in [[Superman]] comics published by [[DC Comics]]. Lara is the biological mother of Superman, and the wife of scientist [[Jor-El]].

Lara's role in the Superman mythos has varied over the years, with her treatment and emphasis often depending on the decade she was written in. Earlier stories treated Lara in a lesser role compared to her scientist husband; however, stories from the 1970s onwards depict Lara in more prominent roles, with the 2004 miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'' as an example of this.

Lara is usually referred to only by her first name. Most depictions of Kryptonian culture show that females use their father's full name as their last names before marriage, and usually use just their first names after marriage. Thus, "Lara Lor-Van" was Lara's full [[maiden name]], as "Lor-Van" is the name of Lara's father.

After constructing his [[Fortress of Solitude]], Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a [[globe]] of their native planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].

==History==
===Golden and Silver Age versions===
Lara was first referred to in the Superman [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] in 1939, where her name was spelled as "Lora"; her name first appeared as being spelled "Lara" in the 1942 novel ''[[The Adventures of Superman (novel)|The Adventures of Superman]]''. After the establishment of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] system in the 1960s, it was retroactively shown that "Lora" was the name of Superman's mother in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] universe, while "Lara" was Superman's mother in the [[Earth-One]] universe.

A 1948 retelling of Superman's origin story first delved into detail about Lara, though her formal and more familiar [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades, with a definitive synopsis in the 1979 miniseries ''The World of Krypton'' (not to be confused with the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late 1980s comic special of the same name).

As it was summarized in this miniseries (and in various other Silver Age stories), Lara was an [[astronaut]] in Krypton's space program. On Krypton, it was deemed that women were more suitable for astronauts than men; however, Krypton's space program was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons. Eventually, Lara met scientist Jor-El, with the two having several adventures together before getting married. Some time later, Lara gave birth to the couple's only child, Kal-El.

When Krypton was about to explode, Lara and Jor-El placed their infant son into an escape rocket built by Jor-El. In earlier versions of the story, Jor-El wanted Lara to accompany their son to [[Earth]], but Lara refused, saying their son would have a better chance of reaching Earth without her extra weight. Kal-El's spaceship then took off, leaving Lara and Jor-El to perish.

===Modern Age versions===

After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''The Man of Steel'' rewrote Superman's origins, details about Lara's background and character were changed. Under Byrne's version, Lara inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Jor-El was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing emotions toward his wife Lara, and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. In this version of the mythos, Lara was a [[librarian]] and historian of high rank, and thought it horrifying that Kal-El would be sent to a "primitive" planet such as Earth (and was repelled by Jor-El's expression of affection toward her).  Her grandmother Lady Nara and Seyg-El, Jor-El's father, were the ones who arranged the union between them &ndash; so that they might have a child who would fill an opening in the planet's Register of Citizens when another Kryptonian died a rare and untimely death.

In the 2004 Superman miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Lara, along with Krypton and Jor-El, were more-or-less reverted back to their Silver Age versions, though with updated touches. In this version, Lara is treated as a fully equal partner to Jor-El in constructing Kal-El's spacecraft, designing various key components.

==In Other Media==
Lara has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the Superman story. However, as was the case in the older comics, Lara usually has a less prominent role than Jor-El in such depictions.

===''Super Friends''===
In the [[Super Friends]], she appeared in the episode called "The Planet Splitter" and also the ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' episode "Secret Origins of the Super Friends."

===''Film''===
Lara was played by [[Susannah York]] in ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' ([[1978 in film|1978]]), ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]])and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest For Peace]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]])(voice only). After [[Marlon Brando]] ([[Jor-El]]) was removed from ''[[Superman II]]'', Lara took on the role as Superman's mentor, in both ''Superman II'' and ''IV''. She was later replaced by Brando's Jor-El in the new [[2006 in film|2006]] edit of ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|II]]''.

===''Smallville''===
[[Image:Lara Lor-Van.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Helen Slater]]'' as Lara]]
Lara has appeared in one episode of Season 3 in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', played by [[Kendall Cross (actress)]].  Clark was dipped in a tank of kryptonite enhanced liquid used to induce repressed memories to come to surface.  His mother placed baby Kal-El into the rocket which will take him to Earth.  While Jor-El was more concerned about his son fulfilling his destiny, Lara was worried no one would love him. Clark came out of his fugue screaming her name. Clark knows his biological mother loves him.  Martha Kent tells him "Lara" was his first word, but she and Jonathan never knew what it meant.

In the episode named "Lara" of season 7, it is revealed that Lara, now played by [[Supergirl (film)|''Supergirl'']] actress [[Helen Slater]], visited the Kent farm prior to the destruction of Krypton. Along with Kara, they hide a photograph of Lara so that Kal-El will find it. It is also noted in this episode that Lara's DNA was hidden in the blue crystal by her brother-in-law [[Zor-El]].  Pictures of Lara from this episode can be found [http://www.kryptonsite.com/laragallery1.htm here].

In the episode "Blue" Lara and Zor-El are released onto Earth in corporeal form (although technically not alive). The story culminates in Clark's destruction of the crystal to rid the world of Zor-El. Although upset to again lose his mother, with her assurance that she loves him, he is able to in order to save Kara's life.

The naming conventions in ''Smallville'' seem to differ from the comic book continuity. Kara refers to Lara as Lara-El at the start of the episode of "Blue." This means that females, on Smallville, take their husbands last name and attach to their first.
 
===DC Animated Universe===
====''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''====
In the 1990s [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Finola Hughes]] provided Lara's voice. Lara's father in this series, a member of the Science Council, was named "Sul-Van."

In ''Last Son of Krypton'' Lara is shown with elements of her Silver Age and Modern Age selves, where she is headstrong and an equal partner to Jor-El, but instead of being a scientist she is an artist.

====''[[Justice League]]''====
Lara made a cameo with Jor-El in the Justice League episode "Twilight". 

====''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''====
In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series episode entitled "For the Man Who Has Everything", Superman's imagined son is named Van, a possible nod to Lara Lor-Van.
