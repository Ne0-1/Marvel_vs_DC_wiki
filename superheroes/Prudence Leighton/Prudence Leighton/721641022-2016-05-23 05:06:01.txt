'''Prudence Leighton''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Prudence, originally a female, was murdered by '''Steinbeck''', a pyrokinetic mutant. She used her ability to possess his body, taking on the codename '''Agent 16''', and also '''the Quiet Man'''. The first appearance of both is ''Mystique #1''.

== Fictional character biography ==

Prudence Leighton was part of a network of secret agents and spies gathered by [[Charles Xavier]] in order to perform missions deemed unfit for the [[X-Men]] due to their sensitive nature. Her last assignment involved the purchase of Soviet Union [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] by military commanders of Cuba.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Prudence was murdered by Steinbeck, a pyrokinetic mutant arms dealer, before the eyes of [[Shortpack]], her handler, who secretly loved her. However she did not pass on completely and took over Steinbeck's body – she accessed his powers and resources and contacted her brother.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Prudence was falling into mental decay because her power didn't really work on men and she and her brother [[Shepard (comics)|Shepard]] set out to assassinate [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] with one of the greatest assassins on the planet, the newly blackmailed agent [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Calling herself the Quiet Man, Prudence played the role of a mysterious benefactor who offered to give Mystique a device that would make her once again untraceable in exchange for her services.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Unfortunately their machinations came apart when Mystique double crossed them. Prudence removed the Quiet Man's cloak and revealed her true identity. She and Mystique fought but Mystique proved far more capable and dodged Steinbeck's breath and Prudence’s punches to stab Quiet Man in the stomach.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Prudence's and Steinbeck's minds apparently went into overdrive and their powers reached critical mass. They began to swell and exploded, throwing Shortpack and Mystique far from the site.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

==Powers and abilities==
Prudence can psi-jump into other people, allowing her consciousness to inhabit their body and control their actions.
Steinbeck/Quiet Man can spew pyrokinetic flames from his throat cavity, inhabited by a second mutant capable of possessing other women.

==Notes==
* Steinbeck killed Prudence's body, but she projected her consciousness into his to escape full death.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Since Prudence can only inhabit women, Steinbeck is theorized to be [[intersex]], enough to qualify for Prudence's power.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
