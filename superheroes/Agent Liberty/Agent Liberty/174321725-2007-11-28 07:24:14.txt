'''Agent Liberty''' (real name '''Benjamin Lockwood''') is a [[fictional character]] from [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Superman'' vol. 2, #60 (October 1991).

==Fictional character biography==
Agent Liberty's real name is Benjamin Lockwood.  He once worked for the CIA but ultimately left in disgust with their methods and the types of missions he was being asked to undertake.  He later became so disenchanted with the Federal Government as a whole that he joined the paramilitary group called the '''Sons Of Liberty''', who outfitted him with the costume and weaponry he uses as Agent Liberty.  In the beginning, Lockwood used his Agent Liberty guise to help the Sons' stated cause of overturning the current governmental regime, which brought him into conflict with Superman; however, when the Sons' leadership asked him to perform an assassination of politician Pete Ross, Lockwood refused, and left the Sons to go solo.  During his time working with the Sons, Agent Liberty also briefly assisted the Justice League against the villain [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

Lockwood helps bring down the Sons by sending vital information to the reporter [[Clark Kent]]. 

In his last recorded appearance, Lockwood learned that one of the founders of the Sons of Liberty was in actuality his former CIA mentor, and he became so disgusted with this that he burned his Agent Liberty costume, vowing to never undertake that identity again.

==Powers and abilities==
Agent Liberty's costume has equipment that can generate a force-shield of energy capable of deflecting bullets, weapons such as retracting blades, and a jetpack that allows him to fly for short distances.  Agent Liberty is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant.
