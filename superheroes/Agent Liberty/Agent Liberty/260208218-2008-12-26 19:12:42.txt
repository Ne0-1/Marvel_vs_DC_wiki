==Fictional character biography==
Agent Liberty's real name is Benjamin Lockwood.  He once worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] but ultimately left in disgust with their methods and the types of missions he was being asked to undertake.  He later became so disenchanted with the Federal Government as a whole that he joined the paramilitary group called the '''Sons Of Liberty''', who outfitted him with the costume and weaponry he uses as Agent Liberty.  In the beginning, Lockwood used his Agent Liberty guise to help the Sons' stated cause of overturning the current governmental regime, which brought him into conflict with Superman; however, when the Sons' leadership asked him to perform an assassination of politician Pete Ross, Lockwood refused, and left the Sons to go solo.  During his time working with the Sons, Agent Liberty also briefly assisted the Justice League against the villain [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

Lockwood helps bring down the Sons by sending vital information to the reporter [[Clark Kent]]. 

Lockwood learns that one of the founders of the Sons of Liberty was in actuality his former CIA mentor, and he became so disgusted with this that he burned his Agent Liberty costume, vowing to never undertake that identity again.

However, he does take it up later. During the literally Earth-shaking crisis of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Agent Liberty shows up at a mass for fallen and missing superheroes. Dozens of other heroes are also in attendance. 

Dozens of heroes, Agent Liberty included, also gather to defend the city of Metropolis from the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]]. The attack is detailed in ''Infinite Crisis'' #6. Liberty is seen heading for a heavily armed [[cyborg]] being. Ultimately, the Society loses the battle.

Agent Liberty made his next appearance in ''Superman'', Vol. 1, #681 (December 2008), having been brought out of retirement to act as a member of the President's security detail while meeting with Superman and other [[Kryptonian]]s newly arrived on Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Agent Liberty's costume has equipment that can generate a force-shield of energy capable of deflecting bullets, weapons such as retracting blades, and a jetpack that allows him to fly for short distances.  Agent Liberty is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant.
