==Fictional character biography==
===Benjamin Lockwood===
Agent Liberty's real name is Benjamin Lockwood. He once worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] but ultimately left in disgust with their methods and the types of missions he was being asked to undertake. He later became so disenchanted with the Federal Government as a whole that he joined the paramilitary group called the '''Sons of Liberty''', who outfitted him with the costume and weaponry he uses as Agent Liberty. In the beginning, Lockwood used his Agent Liberty guise to help the Sons' stated cause of overturning the current governmental regime, which brought him into conflict with [[Superman]]; however, when the Sons' leadership asked him to perform an assassination of politician [[Pete Ross]], Lockwood refused, and left the Sons to go solo. During his time working with the Sons, Agent Liberty also briefly assisted the Justice League against the villain [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] in the crossover ''[[Panic in the Sky (comics)|Panic in the Sky]]''.

Lockwood helps bring down the Sons by sending vital information to the reporter Clark Kent (Superman's civilian identity).

Lockwood learns that one of the founders of the Sons of Liberty was in actuality his former CIA mentor, and he became so disgusted with this that he burned his Agent Liberty costume, vowing to never undertake that identity again.

However, he does take it up later. At one time, unwillingly, as one of many brainwashed victims of a cult started by the villain Brainiac.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #72 October 2004</ref>  Agent Liberty and the other kidnapped meta-humans are rescued by [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]. Later, during the literally Earth-shaking crisis of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Agent Liberty shows up at a mass for fallen and missing superheroes. Dozens of other heroes are also in attendance.

Dozens of heroes, Agent Liberty included, also gather to defend the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] from the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]].<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #6</ref> Liberty is seen heading for a heavily armed [[cyborg]] being. Ultimately, the Society loses the battle.

Agent Liberty comes out of retirement to act as a member of the President's security detail while meeting with Superman and other [[Kryptonian]]s newly arrived on Earth.<ref>''Superman'', Vol. 1, #681 (December 2008)</ref>

He was apparently killed when [[Superwoman#Lucy Lane|Superwoman]] uses her heat vision on him after she caught him spying on [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]] and [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''Action Comics'' #873 (March 2009)</ref> His body was dumped in Metropolis Harbor where it was discovered and brought ashore by a group of boaters. Upon an autopsy it is discovered that Agent Liberty's suit had sent out a distress signal at the moment of his death, leaving clues to who killed him. Metropolis Metacrimes Inspector headed the investigation into Agent Liberty's murder, but before he could remove Liberty's armor, [[Lucy Lane]] had Agent Liberty's body removed from Metropolis City Hospital.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #37 (March 2009)</ref><ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #38 (April 2009)</ref>

===Female Agent Liberty===
During the Codename: Patriot arc, a new female Agent Liberty has been seen as part of President Martin Suarez' security team.<ref>''World of New Krypton'' #6</ref> It is unknown at this time if she is connected to the Sons of Liberty, or even her predecessor Benjamin Lockwood, or if she is in fact yet another agent in General Lane's considerable list of operatives. The new Agent Liberty is apparently killed by [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] when she attacks the White House during the ''[[War of the Supermen]]''.<ref>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_pScx8BN4h3s/S_UTvmkPUTI/AAAAAAAAIZQ/Qt2BNcEq3Xk/s1600/war+of+sup+3-08.jpg</ref>

[[Sam Witwer]] portrays Benjamin "Ben" Lockwood/Agent Liberty as a series regular and the main [[antagonist]] of the [[Supergirl (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', set within [[The CW]]'s [[live-action]] [[Arrowverse]]. "A brilliant orator in the guise of a family man" who has eerie abilities of persuasion and manipulation, this version of the character is depicted as "the ruthless and terrifying figurehead of the '''Children of Liberty''', a human-supremacist group that supports a human-first world order".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/07/17/smallville-sam-witwer-supergirl-season-4-agent-liberty/|title=Smallville alum Sam Witwer joins Supergirl season 4 as Agent Liberty|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|date=July 17, 2018|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref> Ben Lockwood was once a mild-mannered college professor who only became an anti-alien activist after losing his home and father Peter ([[Xander Berkeley]]) during the [[Daxamite]] [[Supergirl (season 2)|invasion]] and [[List of Supergirl_characters#Samantha_Arias/Reign|Reign]]'s [[Supergirl (season 3)|terraforming]] of Earth, respectively. After being fired by the university for his anti-alien opinions, Ben was approached by [[Mercy Graves]], who gave him the armor and gear to become a self-proclaimed "'''Agent of Liberty'''". Ben then founds the Children of Liberty to rid earth of all alien life, including [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], while keeping his terrorist activities a secret from his wife Lydia ([[Sarah Smyth]]) and son George ([[Graham Verchere]]). He later defeats reporter Kara Danvers, Supergirl’s secret civilian identity, during an alien debate on national television, prompting the network to offer Ben his very own weekly show named “The Lockdown”. Seeking revenge on Agent Liberty for killing his alien fiancé, the vigilante [[Manchester Black]] kidnaps Lydia and tells her about her husband’s alter ego. Ben frees Lydia and flees to his father’s abandoned [[Nth Metal]] factory, where he ultimately gains the upper hand on Manchester and prepares to execute him. Having deduced Agent Liberty’s identity with the help of the [[Department of Extranormal Operations|D.E.O.]], Supergirl intervenes and arrests both Ben and Manchester in front of Lydia. Following the announcement that Ben, now publicly exposed as the Children of Liberty's leader, has been taken into police custody, a large crowd of human rights activists with anti-alien sentiments rally outside the penitentiary to protest Ben’s imprisonment. Ben is surprised to see Lydia leading the crowd in chanting “Liberty”, and whispers “see you soon” when he notices Supergirl watching him from the sky.
