He's someone who had off panel run-ins with guys like the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], and [[Thin Man (comics)|Thin Man]]. But no one really remembers him. The way he works in this book is that he's one of the guys in [[Hank Pym]]'s lab in [[Avengers: The Initiative|the Initiative]]. You read stuff like '[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]' and you see that they're making heroes like [[The Order (comics)#The Initiative|the new Champions]]. And that's one of the places he comes in. The Baron is a [[Nazi]] [[geneticist]] who is helping out the Initiative in the same way [[Wernher von Braun]] was helping out the [[NASA]] space program. As much as we hate the Nazis and they were awful human beings, we used guys who worked on the [[V2 rocket|V-2 rockets]] to help us put men on the moon and the Russians were using them too. There's something like that going on in the Initiative but I can't say any more about it.}}

Originally, Blitzschlag's role was going to be filled by the pre-existing character [[Arnim Zola]], but this was changed due to [[Ed Brubaker]]'s plans for the character in ''[[Captain America]]''. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=138571|title=CHRISTOS GAGE JOINS DAN SLOTT ON THE INITIATIVE|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=2007-12-05|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
During [[World War II]], Baron Werner Von Blitzschlag was a Nazi supervillain who fought [[superhero]]es such as the Black [[Captain America]] [[Isaiah Bradley]], [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], and [[Thin Man (comics)|Thin Man]].<ref name=ati15>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #15</ref>

Following the conclusion to [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Baron Von Blitzschlag is recruited into [[Avengers: The Initiative|The Initiative]]  and works at [[Camp Hammond]], seemingly taking the position as the head of scientific research. He sits in on training sessions and is particularly interested in the development of [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]]'s abilities. 

Following the death of [[MVP (comics)|MVP]], Von Blitzschlag is asked to perform the autopsy. After discovering MVP's naturally formed peak human abilities, he argues with [[Hank Pym]] over whether exploiting MVP's genetic material in order to create more [[superheroes]] is [[medical ethics|ethical]]. After Pym laments the fact that he has to work with a former [[supervillain]] and Nazi, Von Blitzschlag points out Pym's role in a number of "villainous" acts including the creation of [[Ultron]] and the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Clone/Cyborg]] from [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], finishing by saying "Don't hate me Herr Pym, for I am your greatest fan!".

When the  Vulturions (criminals using the flying technology created by the original [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]) stole a briefcase containing classified research on [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] from Von Blitzschlag, he attempted to stop them, and displayed a power to generate electricity. However, he was unable produce more than an electric glow around his hand, indicating that his powers are extremely weakened.

It is later revealed that Von Blitzschlag used MVP's body to clone several duplicates, three of which are currently serving as the [[Scarlet Spiders]] who treat Blitzschlag as a father figure.

When a new clone of MVP interfaced with [[Armory (comics)|Armory's]] Tactigon weapon, he remembered the death of the original like it was his own. Subsequently, the clone went on a mad rampage, during which he threw a gurney at the Baron. Von Blitzschlag got up severely injured reactivating his powers to keep himself alive and able to send [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], and [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]] on a mission to stop the mad clone, known as KIA.

Wounded during the mission, he's left [[wheelchair]] bound and relying on a life-supporting apparatus powered by his own bioelectricity. He asks for a [[Purple Heart]] medal for being wounded in service, but he's refused by [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], due to his past as a Nazi.

When [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]]' life support is rendered unable to sustain his life functions due to a [[Skrull]] attack during the [[Secret Invasion]], Von Blitzschlag is willing to share his energy to keep Rhodes alive until the crisis is resolved. <ref name=ati15 />
