'''Proxima Midnight''' is a fictional cosmic [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a prominent member of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], a team of aliens who work for the titan [[Thanos]].

==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]] who unlike the other Black Order members, was not co-created by [[Jerome Opeña]]. She first appeared in a one panel cameo in ''The New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #8 (September 2013). Her first full appearance came later that month in ''Infinity'' #1, which also features the first appearance of the Black Order.

==Fictional character biography==
Proxima Midnight is a member of [[Thanos]]' [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]]. Thanos chose her for her expert combatant skills. Proxima is the wife of fellow Order member [[Corvus Glaive]]. She was sent to earth to retrieve an [[Infinity Gem]] from [[Namor]],<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #8</ref> but came into contact with the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref name="Proxima">''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> She battled [[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]] and [[Luke Cage]] where she found herself evenly matched. She was humiliated by Thanos' disapproval of her actions as well as the fact that Namor did not actually possess the Gem.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> Proxima and the rest of the Order were directed by Namor to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] to search for the Gem, but were distracted when [[Ebony Maw]] revealed the location of Thane, Thanos' son. Thane wanted nothing to do with his father and imprisoned him and Proxima in [[Amber|amber]] where they were taken to Necropolis.<ref>''Infinty'' #5-6</ref>

Namor freed Proxima, as well as Thanos, and asked that they join his Cabal due to his own anger towards earth.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> However, Namor soon found himself hating the Cabal's tactics and vowed to work with the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] to defeat them. Namor himself was betrayed and found himself and the Cabal stuck on an earth that was to be destroyed. They all managed to escape into the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe and vowed to get their revenge.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #40-41</ref> They crafted a "life raft" and managed to live past [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|the destruction of all universes]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref> The Cabal ended up on [[Battleworld]] where they proceeded to attack the locals. However, [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]] dispersed the group to the various corners of Battleworld<ref>''Secret Wars'' #2-3</ref> and Proxima, along with Corvus Glaive, were imprisoned by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #6</ref> 

She managed to return to her own home when the Mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] was rebuilt.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #9</ref> She met up with Thanos and a cloaked figure, later revealed to be [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], and teamed up with her to retrieve [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref>''Unworthy Thor'' #2</ref> Their quest would lead them into battling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Beta Ray Bill]], [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]] and others.<ref>''Unworthy Thor'' #3-4</ref> Ultimately, Proxima and Hela were humiliated and forced to return empty handed. To prove herself worthy, Hela killed Proxima in front of Thanos, adding one last humiliation for her.<ref>''Unworthy Thor'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Proxima possessed the typical attributes of a super powered individual including super strength, super speed, super endurance and some invulnerability. Being able to survive planetary reentry without injury, she was also a master combatant and owned a spear created from a star trapped in a quantum singularity by Thanos himself.<ref name="Proxima" />

The spear's capable of drastic harm based on how it is thrown and who it is used against, becoming a multi-pronged lance of poisonous energy that follows their target, never missing. 

Said force was fatal to whomever it pierced killing the victim in minutes.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol 2 #2</ref> It could revert to star form gaining infinite mass which weighed down prey in an energy entanglement. This effect could even bind and revert an enraged Hulk back to Bruce Banner upon removal.<ref>''Infinity'' #6</ref>
