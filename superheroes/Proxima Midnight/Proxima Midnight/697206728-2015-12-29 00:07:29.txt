==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=September 2015}}
Proxima Midnight first appeared in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' vol. 3 #8, and was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]].

==Fictional character biography==
Proxima Midnight is one of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], who serve [[Thanos]].

Promixa Midnight and the rest of The Black Order (which also consisted of [[Corvus Glaive]], [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Black Dwarf]], [[Ebony Maw]], and [[Supergiant (comics)|Supergiant]]) arrive at different places on Earth to confront the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. Proxima arrived at [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #8</ref> [[Namor]]'s kingdom was destroyed by Proxima Midnight during [[Thanos]]'s invasion.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #9</ref>

As the Avengers have left Earth to fight the Builders, Thanos has come to tear the Illuminati apart. Proxima Midnight desires to destroy the city, so she  and her troops jump out of Thanos' ship and land in New York. She stands up in a crater and commands her host to hunt and kill. [[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]] hears the explosions and goes to help out. Her [[Blade (comics)|mysterious guest]] says he cannot be seen in America, and needs her help for a mysterious mission, but she is adamant... he is in a costume shop, and if he wants her help, he'll put on a costume and come help her. At the impact point, Proxima Midnight is leading her people when [[Luke Cage]], [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s body), and [[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]] all show up at the same time. They are suddenly joined by Spectrum's mystery man who is wearing a "[[Blade (comics)|Spider Hero]]" costume.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> The [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] continue to battle the forces of Proxima Midnight. Spectrum is seriously injured. Bystanders help the Avengers get back in the fight. Thanos appears in hologram form berating Proxima Midnight for her failure to destroy the city.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

The event ended with the defeat of Thanos's forces and the capture of Thanos and his generals Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive, all three of whom were imprisoned in amber in "a state of living death" by Thanos's son Thane.<ref>''Infinity'' #6</ref> They joined the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]] and [[Terrax|Terrax the Enlightened]] as Illuminati prisoners.{{issue|date=July 2014}} They were later freed by [[Namor]] and formed the new [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #23</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Proxima Midnight has superhuman strength, speed, durability, and endurance. She's also a master hand-to-hand combatant. She wields a spear forged for her by Thanos, which was created from a collapsing sun trapped in space-time acting and wielded as both a star and a supernova at once. When thrown it becomes a lance of multi-arcing energy carrying the weight, speed and near infinite mass of its template sake. It never misses its mark acting as both a lethal projectile with absolute constant velocity and a form of energy netting which turns jet black after ensnaring a target weighing them down using the heft of stars, effectively immobilizing them. Its effects were potent enough to match and bind the virtually limitless strength of the Hulk as well as revert him to Bruce Banner once upon drawing it out of him.
