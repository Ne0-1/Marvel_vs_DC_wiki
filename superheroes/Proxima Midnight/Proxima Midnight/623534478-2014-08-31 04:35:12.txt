[[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]] hears the explosions and goes to help out. Her [[Blade (comics)|mysterious guest]] says he cannot be seen in America, and needs her help for a mysterious mission, but she is adamant... he is in a costume shop, and if he wants her help, he'll put on a costume and come help her.
