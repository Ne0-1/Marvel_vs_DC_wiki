'''Inspector William Henderson''' is a supporting character in [[Superman]] comics published by [[DC Comics]].

Inspector Henderson first appeared in the 1940s radio series ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', in which he was Superman's police contact. He was subsequently introduced in a similar role in the 1950s ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television series, where he was portrayed by [[Robert Shayne]].<ref name="LightningBolts">"Lightning Bolts," ''Black Lightning'' #3 (July 1977).</ref> Mainly used as a sounding board in that capacity, the only detail about Henderson's personal life that was revealed was that he had a son named Ray.<ref name="LightningBolts" />

It took a while longer for Inspector Henderson to be introduced in the comics, however; his first appearance there was in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #440 in October 1974, once again as Superman's main police contact. He also appeared in issues of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' series.<ref name="LightningBolts" />

In ''[[Superboy (comic book)|New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #6 (June 1980), a younger version of the character was introduced. Detective-Sergeant Henderson visited [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] in an attempt to convince [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] to relocate to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where the rate and volume of crime was much higher.  Henderson was unsuccessful, although the Boy of Steel would relocate to Metropolis upon reaching adulthood and becoming Superman.

Since [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, Inspector Henderson's role has been reduced somewhat, in favor of newer characters [[Dan Turpin]] and [[Maggie Sawyer]]. Currently, Henderson is Metropolis' [[police commissioner]]. 

In ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #37 (March 2009) introduces Inspector Mike Henderson, an African-American detective who heads the Metropolis Metacrimes Division, one of two units replacing Sawyer and Turpin's Special Crimes Unit (the other being the [[Science Police]]).

==In other media==
Inspector Henderson has also appeared in the 1990s live-action television series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. In most of his appearances he was played by [[Richard Belzer]], however the role was played by [[Mel Winkler]] (who reprised the role—as Commissioner Henderson—in an episode of the 1990s cartoon ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'') and [[Brent Jennings]], prior to Belzer's assumption of the role. A recurring character during ''Lois and Clark'''s first season, Inspector Henderson did not appear in subsequent seasons.

As noted above, actor Mel Winkler appeared in ''Superman: The Animated Series'' as Henderson, appearing briefly in the episode "Feeding Time".
