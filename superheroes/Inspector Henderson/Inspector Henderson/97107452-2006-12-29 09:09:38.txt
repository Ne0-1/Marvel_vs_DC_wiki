'''Inspector William Henderson''' is a supporting character in [[Superman]] comics published by [[DC Comics]].

Inspector Henderson first appeared in the [[1940s]] ''[[Superman (radio)|Superman radio series]]'', in which he was Superman's police contact. He was subsequently introduced in a similar role in the [[1950s]] ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' [[television]] series, where he was played by [[Robert Shayne]]. 

It took a while longer for Inspector Henderson to be introduced in the comics, however; his first appearance there was in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #442 in December [[1974]], once again as Superman's main police contact. He also appeared in issues of the ''[[Black Lightning]]'' series.

In the [[1980s]] ''[[Superboy]]'' comics, Inspector Henderson was introduced in that series as "[[Detective-Sergeant]]" Henderson, where he was visiting [[Smallville]] in an unsuccessful attempt (for the time being, anyway) to convince Superboy to relocate to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

Since [[John Byrne]]'s [[1986]] ''[[Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, Inspector Henderson's role has been reduced somewhat, in favor of newer characters [[Dan Turpin]] and [[Maggie Sawyer]]. Currently, Henderson is Metropolis' [[police commissioner]]. 

Inspector Henderson has also appeared in the [[1990s]] live-action television series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. In most of his appearances he was played by [[Richard Belzer]].  However in the pilot, he was played by [[Mel Winkler]], who reprised the role (as Commissioner Henderson) in an episode of the [[1990s]] cartoon ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.  Furthermore, in the fourth episode of ''Lois and Clark'', Inspector Henderson was played by black actor [[Brent Jennings]], the only time to date the character has not been played by a white actor.  Inspector Henderson never appeared in any ''Lois and Clark'' episodes after the first season.
