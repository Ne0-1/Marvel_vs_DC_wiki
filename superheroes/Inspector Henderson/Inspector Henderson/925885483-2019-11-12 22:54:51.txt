==History==
===Radio history===
Inspector Henderson is a police [[inspector]] who first appeared in the 1940s radio series ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', in which he was Superman's police contact.<ref name="LightningBolts">"Lightning Bolts," ''Black Lightning'' #3 (July 1977).</ref> Mainly used as a sounding board in that capacity, the only detail about Henderson's personal life that was revealed was that he had a son named Ray.<ref name="LightningBolts" /> Inspector Henderson was voiced by [[Matt Crowley]] and later by Earl George.

===Comic history===
It took a while longer for Inspector Henderson to be introduced in the comics. When he did, he was once again as Superman's main police contact.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #442. DC Comics.</ref>

He also appeared in issues of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' series where it is revealed that he has a son named Andrew who is a member of the [[100 (DC Comics)|100]].<ref name="LightningBolts" />

In ''[[Superboy (comic book)|New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #6 (June 1980), a younger version of the character was introduced. Detective-Sergeant Henderson visited [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] in an attempt to convince [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] to relocate to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where the rate and volume of crime was much higher. Henderson was unsuccessful, although the Boy of Steel would relocate to Metropolis upon reaching adulthood and becoming Superman.

Since [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, Inspector Henderson's role has been reduced somewhat, in favor of newer characters [[Dan Turpin]] and [[Maggie Sawyer]]. Currently, Henderson is Metropolis' [[police commissioner]].

''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #37 (March 2009) introduces Inspector Mike Henderson, an African-American detective who heads the Metropolis Metacrimes Division, one of two units replacing Sawyer and Turpin's Special Crimes Unit (the other being the [[Science Police]]).

However, unlike the comic books, he is an African American in the television series. Halfway through season one, Henderson gets promoted to Deputy Chief after getting evidence of the corruption done by Deputy Chief Zeke Cayman and those police officers involved. In season 2, Henderson figures out that Jefferson Pierce is Black Lightning while learning that Anissa is Thunder. While hurt at Jefferson for keeping this secret, he still works with him when it comes to finding ways to bring Tobias Whale to justice. Around the end of the series, he does get [[Helga Jace]] into her custody until the metahuman bounty hunter Instant appears and takes her to his Markovian employers. In season three, Henderson is now the [[chief of police]] and is intimidated by Commander Carson Williams to do a televised press conference about the [[A.S.A. (comics)|A.S.A.]]'s imposed curfew or else he would make his family's lives miserable. Henderson reluctantly complied. The episode "The Book of Occupation: Chapter Five: Requiem for Tavon" revealed that he has been secretly helping Blackbird form a secret resistance against the A.S.A. where he manages to get Frank "Two-Bits" Tanner and Reverend Jeremiah Holt on his side."
