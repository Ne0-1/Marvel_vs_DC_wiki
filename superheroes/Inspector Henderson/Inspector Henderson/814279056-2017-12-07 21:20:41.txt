==History==
===Radio history===
Inspector Henderson is a police [[inspector]] who first appeared in the 1940s radio series ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', in which he was Superman's police contact.<ref name="LightningBolts">"Lightning Bolts," ''Black Lightning'' #3 (July 1977).</ref> Mainly used as a sounding board in that capacity, the only detail about Henderson's personal life that was revealed was that he had a son named Ray.<ref name="LightningBolts" /> Inspector Henderson was voiced by [[Matt Crowley]] and later by Earl George.

===Comic history===
It took a while longer for Inspector Henderson to be introduced in the comics, however; his first appearance there was in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #442 in December 1974, once again as Superman's main police contact. He also appeared in issues of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' series.<ref name="LightningBolts" />

In ''[[Superboy (comic book)|New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #6 (June 1980), a younger version of the character was introduced. Detective-Sergeant Henderson visited [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] in an attempt to convince [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] to relocate to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where the rate and volume of crime was much higher. Henderson was unsuccessful, although the Boy of Steel would relocate to Metropolis upon reaching adulthood and becoming Superman.

Since [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, Inspector Henderson's role has been reduced somewhat, in favor of newer characters [[Dan Turpin]] and [[Maggie Sawyer]]. Currently, Henderson is Metropolis' [[police commissioner]].

''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #37 (March 2009) introduces Inspector Mike Henderson, an African-American detective who heads the Metropolis Metacrimes Division, one of two units replacing Sawyer and Turpin's Special Crimes Unit (the other being the [[Science Police]]).
