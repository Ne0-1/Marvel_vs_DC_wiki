==History==
===Radio history===
Inspector Henderson is a police [[inspector]] who first appeared in the 1940s radio series ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', in which he was Superman's police contact.<ref name="LightningBolts">"Lightning Bolts," ''Black Lightning'' #3 (July 1977).</ref> Mainly used as a sounding board in that capacity, the only detail about Henderson's personal life that was revealed was that he had a son named Ray.<ref name="LightningBolts" /> Inspector Henderson was voiced by [[Matt Crowley]] and later by Earl George.

===Comic history===
It took a while longer for Inspector Henderson to be introduced in the comics. When he did, he was once again as Superman's main police contact.<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #442. DC Comics.</ref>

He also appeared in issues of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' series where it is revealed that he has a son named Andrew who is a member of the [[100 (DC Comics)|100]].<ref name="LightningBolts" />

In ''[[Superboy (comic book)|New Adventures of Superboy]]'' #6 (June 1980), a younger version of the character was introduced. Detective-Sergeant Henderson visited [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] in an attempt to convince [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] to relocate to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where the rate and volume of crime was much higher. Henderson was unsuccessful, although the Boy of Steel would relocate to Metropolis upon reaching adulthood and becoming Superman.

Since [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, Inspector Henderson's role has been reduced somewhat, in favor of newer characters [[Dan Turpin]] and [[Maggie Sawyer]]. Currently, Henderson is Metropolis' [[police commissioner]].

''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' (vol. 5) #37 (March 2009) introduces Inspector Mike Henderson, an African-American detective who heads the Metropolis Metacrimes Division, one of two units replacing Sawyer and Turpin's Special Crimes Unit (the other being the [[Science Police]]).

In the episode "The Talking Clue," Inspector Henderson has a teenage son named Ray (portrayed by Richard Shackleton).
* Inspector Henderson appeared in the ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' episode "Night of the Living Shadows."
* Inspector Henderson appeared in the 1990s live-action television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. In most of his appearances, he was portrayed by [[Richard Belzer]], however the role was played by [[Mel Winkler]] and [[Brent Jennings]], prior to Belzer's assumption of the role. A recurring character during ''Lois & Clark'''s first season, Inspector Henderson did not appear in subsequent seasons.
* Henderson appeared briefly in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Feeding Time", reprised by Mel Winkler. This version is the police commissioner of the Metropolis Police Department. Henderson is seen telling Clark Kent, [[Jimmy Olsen]], and [[Lois Lane]] about how a police officer was attacked by [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].
* Henderson is portrayed by [[Damon Gupton]] in [[The CW]] series ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/black-lightning-casts-james-remar-damon-gupton-series-regulars-comic-con-1202133950/|title=‘Black Lightning’ Casts James Remar & Damon Gupton As Series Regulars, Watch Trailer – Comic-Con|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=2017-07-23|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Just like the comics, he has issues with Black Lightning's vigilante work and would reluctantly work with him when it comes to thwarting the specific plots of the 100. In addition, he has become displeased with some of his fellow police officers mingling with criminals like Deputy Police Chief Cayman. In the episode "Black Jesus: The Book of Crucifixion," Inspector Henderson was shocked to find that Deputy Police Chief Caymen had led the arrest on Jefferson Pierce for possession of Greenlight which Cayman secretly planted on the orders of an unseen Vice-Principal Kara Fowdy. After finding out about Detective Glennon's son having raised money that is not paid to the IRS and planning to keep quiet in exchange that Glennon tells him what he needs to know, Henderson has Jefferson released and has Cayman arrested for his corruption. During a news report that mentioned Jefferson's exoneration and the arrest of Cayman and his cohorts, Henderson's press conference is seen as he reveals that he has been sworn in as the new Deputy Chief of Police. In the episode "The Book of Consequences: Chapter One: Rise of the Green Light Babies," Henderson confronts Black Lightning where he put two and two together by claiming that Jefferson Pierce is Black Lightning. Black Lightning had to come clean while also admitting that his daughter Anissa is Thunder. Feeling betrayed that Jefferson kept these secrets from him, Henderson takes his leave from the area without saying a word. In the episode "The Book of Consequences: Chapter Three: Master Lowry," Henderson reluctantly turned to Jefferson when Detective Summers was killed and wanted Black Lightning to track down one of the people who is known for setting fires to cars. Also, Henderson learned that Jefferson was replaced as principal in light of the 100's attack on Garfield High. Once that was done, Henderson is informed by Black Lightning that the person was hired by Tobias Whale. This leads Henderson and his police officers to track down Tobias Whale at his sister's crypt where Henderson led in his arrest. Then Henderson informed Jefferson that they finally caught Tobias Whale and wanted him to be the first to know about it.
