'''Spike''' and '''The Spike''' are the names of several [[fictional character]]s in [[Marvel Comics]].  Recent characters of this name have had similar powers to generate projectile spikes, possibly inspired by [[Spyke]] from [[X-Men: Evolution]].

The Spike is a character in the the ''[[X-Statix]]'' series from [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''X-Force'' #121, and was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Mike Allred]]. He is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with superhuman powers. He should not be confused with [[Spike Freeman]], another character in X-Statix/X-Force.

''Spike'' is also the name of a similar character from ''New X-Men'', and also appeared in the film [[X-Men: The Last Stand]], albeit as a hulking villain with no apparent connection to the more commonly known character, aside from name and powers.

==The Spike (X-Statix) ==
After watching video footage of the Spike in action, the senior members of X-Statix, except the [[Anarchist (comics)|Anarchist]], voted to have him join the team. At the press conference to announce his membership, the Spike arrived calling the Anarchist racial names and the two instantly began butting heads. Eager to gain more media attention, [[Vivisector]] and Phat jumped into a fight with the Spike in “defense” of their teammate. 

When [[U-Go Girl]] hosted the [[Larry King]] Show, she had the Spike show up as her first guest. This swiftly erupted once again into a battle between the Anarchist, Vivisector, [[Phat (comics)|Phat]], and the Spike. In the middle of the battle, [[Lacuna (comics)|Lacuna]] traveled between seconds and removed everyone’s clothing. After announcing her candidacy in X-Statix, she returned their clothing and left. 

During some downtime with the team, the Spike, along with the other members of X-Statix, were transported to a dimension residing inside [[Doop (comics)|Doop]], where they each faced their worst fears. In Spike’s “torture realm,” the only thing Doop found was a book entitled “Spikey Cross-Dressing,” bearing the image of the Spike wearing a red dress and fishnets. After saving them and returning them to their [[Santa Monica]] HQ, Doop noticed that only a second had gone by and no one appeared to have any memory of ever leaving. 

The Spike returned home from a mission with the rest of X-Statix, but they wound up in the ocean, due to U-Go Girl’s malfunctioning mutant power. She attempted to teleport them from the ocean, only to wind up in a forest. In the forest, the team signaled a plane and they hitched a ride by to California via [[Federal Express]]. 

He was among the X-Statix members seen at a parade in their honor, after they successfully took out a Japanese terrorist sect. The mutant terrorist group the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]] attacked X-Statix, calling them “mutant sellouts,” due to their popularity and media attention. As the Brotherhood attacked, the Spike joined his teammates into jumping into action. The Spike aided the [[Orphan (comics)|Orphan]] in killing one of the Brotherhood members by impaling her as she fell backwards from the Orphan’s punch. After defeating the Brotherhood, the Orphan asked what just happened and U-Go Girl replied, “The end of a revolution?” 

The Spike participated in a battle in [[Central America]] alongside his teammates in X-Statix, where his rivalry with the Anarchist came to blows, as they competed to kill as many militiamen as possible, as if trying to beat each other in the “amount killed” department. 

The Spike returned to Santa Monica with the rest of the team, where they were bombarded with questions by the media. After U-Go Girl, the Orphan, and the Anarchist returned from their failed attempt to contact [[Dead Girl]], the team's manager [[Spike Freeman]] instructed X-Statix on its upcoming mission to help the [[C.I.A.]] get a better image. The team was to head into space to stop the "Bush Rangers", and then forfeit and get saved by the C.I.A., thereby making the C.I.A. look good. The Spike personally expressed anger about the situation. As U-Go Girl and the Orphan argued with C.I.A. Agent Wright, the Spike seemed very disturbed at seeing Vivisector and Phat high-five each other. The team voted on whether or not to go on the mission, with the Spike sided with the Orphan, creating a stalemate. Dead Girl then arrived and put her vote with the Orphan and the team headed into space. 

Once in space, the Spike fired a spike that slashed Vivisector’s arm and demanded to know what was going on between him and Phat. The two admitted they had special feelings for each other, much to the disgust of the Spike. Once X-Statix arrived on the Mars 2010 Space Station that the Bush Rangers had taken control of, they found the crew members, relieved and wanting autographs. What they didn’t realize was that the “crew” were actually the Bush Rangers themselves. As X-Statix split into groups, the Bush Rangers ambushed them, blasting the Anarchist in the back. The Anarchist, along with the Spike and Dead Girl, jumped into action against the Rangers. They paused for a moment as the Bush Rangers claimed they were on the same side and that they were mistreated because of their race. The Spike seemed swayed by this argument, and the Bush Rangers fired upon the Anarchist. Dead Girl jumped in the way however, and was blasted apart. 

As the team relaxed and waited for the C.I.A. Crack Squad led by Agent Wright to arrive, the Spike argued with the Bush Rangers who had seemingly won him over to their side. When the Orphan arrived looking for the Spike, all he found were the remaining Bush Rangers, all disguised to look like the Spike. As a battle broke out, the “real” Spike arrived and rejoined his teammates in X-Statix, stating his "defection" had been a ruse. When the Crack Squad finally boarded the space station, they attempted to kill the senior members of X-Force, who, thanks to U-Go Girl, teleported into a shuttle circling the station. Thinking their teammates dead, the remaining X-Statix members (Vivisector, Phat, the Spike, and Dead Girl) battled the Crack Squad and even killed Agent Wright. After they then boarded a shuttle to escape the station, a man resembling the Spike, dressed in Bush Ranger clothing and extremely battered and bruised, pulled himself up and watched their shuttle leave, claiming he was no traitor. 

The shuttle that U-Go Girl, the Anarchist, and the Orphan had teleported inside went out of control and flew towards the station. Inside the man resembling Spike thought they were coming back to save him, until the shuttle slammed into the station. The other X-Statix members came to rescue them, but just as they were reunited, the Spike who had been left on the station stumbled out of the small shuttle, prompting the other “Spike” to reveal his true nature, that of the last surviving Bush Ranger. The Bush Ranger Spike jumped at the real Spike, fatally impaling himself on one of his spikes.
