Skin is a [[Mutant (fictional)|fictional mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]] of comics.  The character first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men #317''.

==History==
Angelo Espinosa was a former gang member from the Los Angeles area who faked his own death to leave that part of his life behind.  Skin was one of four young mutants (see [[M (comics)|M]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], and [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]) abducted by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], a techno-organic alien race, although one youngster was actually a Phalanx member.  The reason behind the abductions was so that the Phalanx could uncover the secret behind their inability to assimilate mutants into their collective.  Through their combined efforts and those of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]], and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], the four young mutants managed to escape their confines; although, Blink sacrificed herself by using her powers to destroy the Phalanx that had captured them.

Afterwards, Skin accepted an invitation to enroll in the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants owned by Emma Frost where she taught the first group of [[Hellions]] and now was a branch of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]].  Skin was joined by Synch, Jubilee, Husk, and M (and later by [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], [[Penance (comics)|Penance]], and [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]]).  During his stay at the Massachusetts Academy, Skin developed a crush for fellow student M and became close friends with Chamber.  However, he was also hunted by a mutant-killing vigilante known as the [[X-Cutioner]] who believed Skin responsible for the death of Angelo Espinosa.  The X-Cutioner did not know that Skin, in fact, ''was'' Angelo Espinosa. Skin and Chamber succeeded in defeating the vigilante, but kept the secret.

After the Academy closed due to the machinations of [[Adrienne Frost]], Skin returned to Los Angeles with Jubilee in tow.  Some time later, Skin and Jubilee, along with [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]] and a handful of other unknown mutants were found crucified on the lawn of the X-Mansion.  This action was done by the Church of Humanity, a militant, religious anti-mutant organization.  The X-Man [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] used his blood's healing properties to revive Jubilee and Magma but neither Bedlam or Skin survived.

==Powers==
Skin possessed approximately six feet of extra skin.  He was capable of stretching, deforming, wrapping, expanding, and compressing this extra amount of epidermous. When Skin is performing any of these stunts, it is only the epidermous that was manipulated; Skin's skeletal structure was the same as any normal, average boy of his age and height.  Skin's skin had a greyish tone and, because of the extra amount, gave him the appearance of a melted candle.  At one point, along with compressing his skin tighter against his body, Skin was learning to manipulate the pigment melanin in his epidermous in order to appear normal.  However, performing these two stunts together caused him to have migraines and he soon gave up on the idea of being normal.
