'''Skin''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|fictional mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]] of comics.  The character first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men #317''. (1994)

==Fictional character biography==
'''Angelo Espinosa''' was a former gang member from the [[Los Angeles]] area who faked his own death to leave that part of his life behind.  Skin was one of four young mutants (including [[M (comics)|M]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], and [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]) abducted by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], a techno-organic alien race. The reason behind the abductions was so that the Phalanx could uncover the secret behind their inability to [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilate]] mutants into their collective.  Through their combined efforts and those of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]], and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], the four young mutants managed to escape their confines; although, Blink sacrificed herself by using her powers to destroy the Phalanx that had captured them.

Afterwards, Skin accepted an invitation to enroll in the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants owned by Emma Frost where she taught the first group of [[Hellions]] and now was a branch of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. Skin was joined by Synch, Jubilee, Husk, and M (and later by [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], [[Penance (comics)|Penance]], and [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]]). During his stay at the Massachusetts Academy, Skin developed a crush for fellow student M and became close friends with Chamber because both couldn't pass for normal humans in public. However, he was also hunted by a mutant-killing vigilante known as the [[X-Cutioner]] who believed Skin responsible for the death of Angelo Espinosa. The X-Cutioner did not know that Skin, in fact, ''was'' Angelo Espinosa. Skin and Chamber succeeded in defeating the vigilante, but kept the secret.

After the Academy closed due to the machinations of [[Adrienne Frost]], Skin returned to Los Angeles with Jubilee in tow.  Some time later, Skin and Jubilee, along with [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]] and a handful of other unknown mutants were found [[crucify|crucified]] on the lawn of the [[X-Mansion]]. This action was done by the [[Church of Humanity]], a militant, religious anti-mutant organization. The X-Man [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] used his blood's healing properties to revive Jubilee and Magma but neither Bedlam nor Skin survived.

Jubilee, Husk, and Archangel went to visit Skin's grave after Jubilee had recovered only to find that the owner of the [[cemetery]] was about to dig Angelo up and remove him because of his status as a mutant. The girls argued with the foreman, but he insisted that it was against the religious convictions of the cemetery to bury mutants. He offered to [[cremation|cremate]] Angelo's remains and give them to the girls, which he ultimately did.

==Powers and abilities==
Skin possessed approximately six feet of extra skin.  He was capable of stretching, deforming, wrapping, expanding, and compressing this extra amount of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. When Skin is performing any of these stunts, it is only the epidermis that was manipulated; Skin's [[skeleton|skeletal structure]] was the same as any normal, average boy of his age and height.  Skin's skin had a greyish tone and, because of the extra amount, gave him the appearance of a melted candle.  At one point, along with compressing his skin tighter against his body, Skin was learning to manipulate the pigment [[melanin]] in his epidermis in order to appear normal.  However, performing these two stunts together caused him to have [[migraine]]s and he soon gave up on the idea of being normal.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate timeline of the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Skin was featured in ''Generation Next'' as one of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]'s and [[Shadowcat]]'s proteg√©s tapped to rescue [[Illyana Rasputin]] from enslavement at the [[Sugar Man]]'s Core.  Due to their more militant training, Skin was depicted as using his powers in a much more aggressive fashion, including [[impale|impaling]] opponents with skin protrusions.  He was killed in the subsequent attempt to escape from the Core.

==In other media==
* Skin appeared in the made-for-TV [[Generation X (film)|Generation X film]]. In the film, his powers were closer to true elasticity, similar to [[Mister Fantastic]]. However, it caused him pain to use this power.
* In the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', his name appears on a list of names [[Mystique]] scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for Magneto's file.

==Trivia==
* Throughout the issue ''Uncanny X-Men'' #427, Angelo is referred to mistakenly as "Angelo Torres" by author [[Chuck Austen]]. Many fans were upset with this flagrant disregard for the deceased.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
