'''Squirrel Girl''' is a fictional [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Her real name is Doreen Green, and is originally from the [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] area. She first appeared in the ''Winter [[1991]] Marvel Super-Heroes'' special (officially Vol. 2, No. 8) in a story that saw her team-up with [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]], and, incredibly, defeat [[Dr. Doom]]. She is noteworthy for being created by [[Steve Ditko]] (the artist who first worked on [[Spider-Man]]), who drew her first adventure, and which was written by [[Will Murray]].

==History==

The original story (entitled "The Coming of Squirrel Girl!") began with her ambushing [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] in a forest. She hoped to impress the veteran hero, wishing him to take her under his wing as his [[sidekick]]. The 14 year old [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] introduced herself and her pet squirrel (named [[Monkey Joe]]), and displayed her various abilities (all of which were Squirrel themed). Unimpressed, Iron Man politely declined, when suddenly the duo was attacked by Dr. Doom in a large aircraft. Doom captured and subdued Iron Man, and began to fly out over the ocean where he planned to dispose of Iron Man's body once he killed him. Underestimating her, Doom left Squirrel Girl to her own devices. She devised a plan, and used her ability to communicate with squirrels through an open door as the ship passed over the forest. Hundreds of squirrels answered her call and flooded Doom's ship, chewing through the wires, and swamping the evil dictator with their furry bodies. Doom exclaimed "Confound these wretched rodents! For every one I fling away, a dozen more vex me!" Iron Man was freed, they emerged victorious, and the two heroes went their separate ways.

Squirrel Girl's first appearance was almost assured to be her last, given the sillyness of the character's concept, especially in the grittier and more grown up comic market trend of the early [[1990s]]. She existed primarily as a matter of trivia, or an example of an extremely bad character, for the next decade. Her only known appearance during this time was as the pattern on a pair of underwear worn by the comedic character [[Deadpool]] in issue 7 of his series.

In 2005, comic writer [[Dan Slott]] wrote a four issue miniseries for the superhero team the [[Great Lakes Avengers]]. Created in the mid-[[1980s]], this parody team was made up of enthusiastic heroes with bizarre and almost-but-not-quite useless abilities. They had appeared only a handful of times over their 20 year history, serving as comic relief. In commemoration of the team's first starring series, the first roster changes were made, and the Squirrel Girl character was revived. Having relocated to [[New York City]] for some reason, she was fighting crime in [[Central Park]], and encountered the GLA who were on a membership drive. Along with appearing in the story, she also introduced each issue, usually giving a disclaimer or opinion piece about the contents of the series. Her side-kick squirrel, Monkey Joe, was also added to the team, and was used as a sort of commentator to the series, appearing in a circle alongside the story to make comedic and smart-assed remarks.

This miniseries was also a parody of [[comic book death]]s, and it had been announced that a team member would die every issue. After Squirrel Girl made a fuss to be certain that Monkey Joe was an official member of the team, he was killed in the third issue, apparently by Dr. Doom, who had come seeking revenge. In actuality, this was a rejected member of the GLA named Leather Boy in a variation of Dr. Doom's costume. Squirrel Girl found a new squirrel companion in the next issue, whom she named Tippy-Toe.

In the following Winter's GLX-Mas special, Squirrel Girl and Tippy Toe managed to defeat [[M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Terrax]] and [[Thanos]] all by themselves. [[Uatu]], the Earth's [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], was on hand to confirm that the Thanos she defeated was the real thing, and not a clone or copy of any kind (an explanation that has sometimes been used to excuse some of Thanos' more embarrassing performances over the years). After MODOK was defeated, Dum-Dum Dugan offered her a position at [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], explaining that they'd been watching her for some time and found her to be one of the most effective people ever at defeating powerful supervillains. Squirrel Girl declined the offer, saying she was happy being with the GLA.

==Powers and abilities==

Squirrel Girl is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], and like some other mutants (such as [[Angel (comics)|Angel]]), has a variety of mutations which coincidentally align with a certain theme (in her case, obviously, [[squirrels]]). During her first encounter with Iron Man, she gave a detailed demonstration of her powers and abilities: She has a furry, [[prehensile]] tail roughly 3-4 feet in length. She has sizable buck teeth, which are strong enough to chew through wood. She has enhanced agility and strength, enabling her to jump between trees with ease.  Her fingers have claws on them, assisting her with climbing. There are retractable "knuckle spikes" of unknown strength roughly 2-3 inches in length in the back of each of her hands (the mechanism for these is presumably similar to [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine's]] claws). Lastly, she is capable of communicating with and understanding squirrels, who obey her commands, much like the hero [[Aquaman]]'s relationship with fish (although, Squirrel Girl does not communicate with squirrels [[telepathy|telepathically]], but rather has an innate understanding of their language, which she is capable of using. Although, she does also speak to squirrels in English and they demonstrate understanding). Whether this power extends to species of ground squirrels, or other rodents, or merely the traditional [[tree squirrel]] is unknown. Squirrel Girl also carries a belt of pouches which only contain nuts to give as snacks to her squirrel friends. Thus, to much comedic effect, they are her "nut sacks."

She also has markings around her eyes, but whether these are natural due to her mutation, or cosmetically applied to enhance her squirrel themed appearance is unknown.

==Other==
Squirrel Girl was 14 years old at the time of her first appearance, and announced that her birthday is sometime in July. It is unknown how much she has aged in her most recent appearance, however, a profile indicates she is still attending [[High School]], and thus still under 18. It can be assumed then, that her mother moved with her from Los Angeles to New York between her first and second appearences. The ramifications of her sudden move to [[Milwaukee]] to be with the GLA and her relationship with her mother has not yet been seen.

In addition to Monkey Joe and Tippy Toe, Squirrel Girl gave specific names to several other squirrels in GLA #4. These were named Slippy Pete, Mr. Freckle, and Nutso, and all were presumably killed when they were sucked into the singularity created by [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]].
