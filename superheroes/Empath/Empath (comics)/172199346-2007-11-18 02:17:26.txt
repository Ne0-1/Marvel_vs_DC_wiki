'''Empath''' ('''Manuel Alfonso Rodrigo de la Rocha'''), is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Sal Buscema]] and first appeared in ''New Mutants'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #16 (1984) as a member of [[Emma Frost|Emma Frost's]]  original [[Hellions]]. 



==Powers and abilities==
Empath possesses the ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of other sentient life forms. He can affect a large group of individuals at one time, and can exert varying levels of empathic control over them, ranging from subtle manipulations that others are generally unaware of to a complete negation of emotion that reduces others to a zombie-like state in which he can command them with little effort. His power operates by means of Empath's own brainwaves overriding the parts of the brain that govern emotion in others.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality, Empath was held hostage by [[Mikhail Rasputin]], who attached the young mutant to a computer system in order to amplify his empathic abilities to control the human population of [[Eurasia]].  This caused Empath incredible agony, and when his handler, Keeper Murdock (the Age of Apocalypse's version of [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]]), accidentally touched him, Murdock realized the horrific pain the young man was in and ended his life.

==In other media==
Empath appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "Captive Hearts".
