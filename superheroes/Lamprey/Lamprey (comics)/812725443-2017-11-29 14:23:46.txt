'''Lamprey''' ('''Donald McGuiggin''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character appeared in the original [[Squadron Supreme]] series. He was initially created as a [[pastiche]] of the [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

==Fictional character biography==
Donald McGuiggin, alias the Lamprey, was a professional criminal and member of the criminal group called the ''[[Institute of Evil]]'' on the Squadron's [[Earth-712|alternate Earth]]. He had the power to drain energy from other living beings and duplicate their superhuman powers. 

With the Institute of Evil, Lamprey held the [[Golden Archer]] captive, and kidnapped the relatives of the [[Squadron Supreme]] members. The Institute battled the Squadron Supreme, and were defeated.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #5</ref>

Lamprey was one of the Institute members captured by the Squadron and subjected to the Behavior Modification process invented by Squadron member [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]], altering his personality. He then joined the Squadron and aided them in their efforts to conquer the world in order to turn it into a [[utopia]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #6</ref>

Lamprey accompanied Tom Thumb to the 41st Century looking for a cancer cure.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #9</ref>

Squadron member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk I|Nighthawk]] objected to the extreme methods the Squadron was using to achieve its goals, and left the group. New Squadron recruit (and double agent for Nighthawk) [[Haywire (comics)|Haywire]] tricked Lamprey into undergoing Behavior Modification [[brainwashing]] along with several of the former Institute of Evil criminals, using a device created by [[Master Menace]]. Nighthawk used them to form his own group, the [[America Redeemers]], who fought back against the Squadron's "benevolent" tyranny.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #11</ref>

The Redeemers eventually found themselves in an all-out battle against the remaining Squadron members at Squadron City. During this battle, Lamprey tried to absorb the power of [[Doctor Spectrum]], who was able to overload Lamprey's energy absorbing capacity. Lamprey exploded when he tried to absorb all of the energy of Doctor Spectrum's power prism.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lamprey possessed the power to absorb energy from other superhuman beings, and converted said energy to enhance his physical strength and other physical attributes (speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes) potentially to superhuman levels, as well as enabling him to fly. Un-augmented by outside energy, his attributes were peak human and he could not fly. Lamprey leeched energy by physical contact with another being. Every second of contact with another superhuman being imbued him with approximately one hour's worth of augmented powers. Approximately 48 hours worth of energy was the ceiling beyond which he could not absorb further energy without risking grievous bodily injury.

Lamprey had extensive experience at street-fighting.

==Other versions==
A female Lamprey is seen in the ''[[Supreme Power]]: Hyperion'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], which shows the events of a possible future.{{issue|date=March 2013}}
