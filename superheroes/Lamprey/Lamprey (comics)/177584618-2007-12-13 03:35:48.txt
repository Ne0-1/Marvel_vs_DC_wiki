'''Lamprey''' ('''Donald McGuiggin''') is a [[fictional character]] from [[Marvel Comics]]' original [[Squadron Supreme]] series. He was initially created as a [[pastiche]] of the [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].

==Squadron Supreme==

Donald McGuiggin, alias the Lamprey, was a member of the criminal group called the ''[[Institute of Evil]]'' on the Squadron's alternate Earth. He had the power to drain energy from other living beings and duplicate their superhuman powers. 

Lamprey was one of the Institute members captured by the Squadron and subjected to the Behavior Modification process invented by Squadron member [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]], altering his personality. He then joined the Squadron and aided them in their efforts to conquer the world in order to turn it into a [[utopia]]. 

Squadron member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk I|Nighthawk]] objected to the extreme methods the Squadron was using to achieve its goals, and left the group. He undid the Behavior Modification [[brainwashing]] on several of the former Institute of Evil criminals and used them to form his own group, the [[America Redeemers]], who fought back against the Squadron's "benevolent" tyranny.

The Redeemers eventually found themselves in an all-out battle against the remaining Squadron members. During this battle, Lamprey tried to absorb the power of [[Doctor Spectrum]], who was able to overload Lamprey's ability, killing him.

==Alternate versions==
A female Lamprey is seen in the [[Supreme Power]]: Hyperion [[limited series]], which shows the events of a possible future.
