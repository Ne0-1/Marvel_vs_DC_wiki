'''Air-Walker''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character.

Air-Walker was the second herald of [[Galactus]] pictured in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and possessed the same cosmic powers as more well known heralds such as the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Terrax]]. His actual name was Gabriel Lan, and defending Galactus from the Ovoids he was killed by technology designed to kill Galactus himself. Galactus, due to a lack of energy brought about by his hunger, could not spare the energy to restore Air-Walker to life, but later created an [[android]] Air-Walker that noticeably lacked the qualities Galactus had appreciated in his former herald. The Air-Walker android was later destroyed in combat with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

Years later Lan's close friend and successor herald [[Firelord]] and the Silver Surfer revived the Air-Walker android, though in a battle with Galactus's new herald [[Morg]] its skin was destroyed. Air-Walker and Firelord returned to Galactus' service for a time, but when Morg returned he destroyed Air-Walker's body. Lan's consciousness was absorbed into Galactus' Worldship where he sought to direct it to uninhabited worlds. In a subsequent battle between Galactus and [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]], the Worldship was destroyed by the [[Ultimate Nullifier]]. Air-Walker was presumed destroyed in the process.
