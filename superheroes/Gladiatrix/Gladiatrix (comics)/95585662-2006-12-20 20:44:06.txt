'''Gladiatrix''' is a fictional [[heroine]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'' (1st series) #33 ''(March 1986)'', and was created by [[Mike Carlin]] and [[Ron Wilson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Becoming a professional wrestler shortly after her youth, '''Robin Braxton''' has been fighting for her life ever since. She gained her current enhanced strength through an augmentation given by Power Broker INC. Shortly afterward she abandoned her life as a wrestler and became part of the Grapplers.

They were forced to restrain the original Titania (not [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Skeeter]]), who had just lost a battle from Battleaxe. When the Grapplers came face to face with the Thing, Gladiatrix decided to remain on the good side and helped him out, saving the day. Later, Gladiatrix tried out for membership in [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], but got denied after she almost got into a battle with [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]]. 

She agreed to join Superia's [[Femizons]] afterward, becoming a supervillain once more. She was attacked by [[Captain America]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], who Gladiatrix managed to capture. The heroes eventually rescued themselves and defeated Gladiatrix afterward. Since then, Gladiatrix only sporadically appeared as a supervillain, but has remained in comic Limbo for the better part of her career.

===Civil War===

However, during the Civil War event, Gladiatrix chose the side of the heroes once more and got involved into a gang that was strongly against the Super-Hero Registration Act, but got apprehended when a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squad entered their hideout.  She was later seen in the [[Negative Zone]] Prison, being contained in some virtual reality apparatus, begging for someone to help her.
