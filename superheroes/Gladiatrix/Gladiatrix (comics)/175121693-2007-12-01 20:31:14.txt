==Fictional character biography==
Becoming a professional wrestler shortly after her youth, '''Robin Braxton''' has been fighting for her life ever since. She gains her current enhanced strength through an augmentation given by Power Broker INC. Shortly afterward she abandons her life as a wrestler and became part of the Grapplers.

They were forced to restrain [[Titania (Grapplers)|Titania]], who had just lost a battle from Battleaxe. When the Grapplers came face to face with the Thing, Gladiatrix decides to remain on the good side and helps him out, saving the day. Later, Gladiatrix tries out for membership in [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], but was denied after she almost got into a battle with [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]]. 

She agreed to join Superia's [[Femizons]] afterward, becoming a supervillain once more. She was attacked by [[Captain America]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], whom Gladiatrix manages to capture. The heroes eventually rescue themselves and defeat Gladiatrix afterwards. Since then, Gladiatrix only sporadically appears as a supervillain, but has remained in comic ''limbo'' for the better part of her career.

===Civil War===

However, during the Civil War event, Gladiatrix chose the side of the heroes once more and gets involved with a gang that was strongly against the Super-Hero Registration Act. Her allies include, but are not limited to, [[Solo (comics)|Solo]], [[Typeface (comics)|Typeface]] and [[Battlestar]]. She is apprehended when a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] squad enters their hideout. She almost escapes, being responsible for the visiting hero [[Sally Floyd]]. Debris knocks her down and Sally escapes on her own.  She is later seen in the [[Negative Zone]] Prison, being contained in some virtual reality apparatus, begging for someone to help her. As of Civil War #6 however, she, along with the other captive heroes were freed by [[Hulkling]]. The people he frees assist Captain America in their fight against the Pro-Registration forces.
