The '''Creeper''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Steve Ditko]].  He first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #73 ([[1968]]).

{{Spoiler}}

His real name is Jack Ryder, a television news reporter who was demoted due to his outspoken nature. Relegated to network security, he protected a scientist who gave him two devices. One enabled him to instantly heal from any wound and gave enhanced strength and agility, but at the cost of somewhat unbalanced personality. The other enabled him to instantly change into the costume of a green-haired, yellow-skinned, and red-furred wildman; the costume, "imprinted" on the device and thus capable of being summoned and dispelled at will, was originally adopted by Ryder while rescuing the scientist from kidnappers.<!-- somebody remind me to come back and finish *that* story...-->

Following his debut in ''Showcase'', the Creeper was given his own series '''''Beware the Creeper''''', written by Ditko and [[Dennis O'Neil]], which lasted only six issues. Apart from brief series in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (in [[1978]]-[[1979]]) and as a back-up feature in ''[[The Flash]]'' (in [[1983]]), all the Creeper's subsequent appearances have been guest roles.  Over the years, the Creeper's personality underwent changes by different writers; at times his deranged behavior was depicted as only an act to frighten criminals, while at other times he seemed genuinely psychotic.

A subsequent retelling of the Creeper's origin revealed that the scientist surgically implanted the devices (or device, since some accounts claim that it is a single device that can both enhance physical ability and re-create any object whose "imprint" is stored in its circuitry) in order to save Ryder's life after he was attacked and drugged by the criminals he was investigating; because the scientist was unaware of the drugs in Ryder's system, he inadvertently recorded the "imprint" of the drugs at the same time he recorded the "imprint" of the costume.  Thus the same device that re-creates Ryder's costume when he becomes the Creeper also re-creates the drugs in his system, explaining the Creeper's odd personality.  Apparently, the drugs were so overwhelming that it was impossible to completely cleanse their effect from the Creeper's system, and the Creeper gradually descended into ever more intense irrationality, while Jack Ryder, instantly free of the drugs' influence the second he changed back to normal, suffered no such condition.  Eventually, Ryder came to believe that he and the Creeper were two entirely different people instead of two character roles played by the same man; he also held this belief in his Creeper persona, which became increasingly disdainful of "Jack Ryder."  The Creeper once regained his rationality while bound by Wonder Woman's magic lasso, but the implications of this have never been explored.

The Creeper appeared in the [[Eclipso]]: The Darkness Within annuals in 1992, being tricked into taking up one of Eclipso's dark crystals, putting him under Eclipso's control. He was later freed by Bruce Gordon along with all the other enslaved superheroes. The Creeper and Gordon teamed up again in Eclipso's own spin-off series to try and defeat him (The Creeper was chosen to go along because of his dislike for Eclipso following his possession and also because he was mad enough to agree). Despite being caught and escaping once, the Creeper was eventually killed by Eclipso when the team re-invaded the country Eclipso was ruling. The manner of his death was ironic as he was torn to shreds by laughing Eclipsed hyenas. The remains were recovered and there must have been enough left to regenerate, as a Creeper series also launched in 1997. This series strongly indicated that the convoluted Dr. Yatz origin of the Creeper was an implanted memory (or otherwise false), and that the Creeper's actual origins were somehow related to his longtime villain, [[Proteus (DC comics)|Proteus]]. Before this was fully explored, however, the series ceased publication.

Jack Ryder has recently appeared in the pages of [[Action Comics]] as the [[Daily Planet]] reporter who took over the demoted [[Clark Kent]]'s beat.

The Creeper found a new guise in the early 20th century when the Beware The Creeper series was released under the [[Vertigo]] brand. Set in 1930s Paris, and featuring a female Creeper, it was somewhat different to its predecessor.

==In other media==
Jack Ryder appeared several times in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. A few brief appearances as a news reporter led up to his starring role in the episode "Beware the Creeper". 

The animated Creeper had a completely new origin, more straightforward and more closely tied to the Batman continuity: Jack Ryder, [[news anchor|anchoring]] a live TV special on the career of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] from the very factory where the Joker had his life-changing encounter with a vat of chemicals, is interrupted by the Joker himself, who doesn't appreciate the attention. The Joker doses Ryder with his trademark lethal laughing gas and then, to distract the newly arrived [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], pushes him into the same vat of chemicals. The gas and the chemicals react strangely; Ryder survives, but is transformed into an extraordinarily strong and agile maniac with yellow skin, green hair, and a rictus grin, who helps Batman and Robin apprehend the Joker and his gang, both in revenge for what Joker did, and also because he develops an intense attraction to [[Harley Quinn]].  Although his mania is benign (and vaguely reminiscent of [[Freakazoid]]) his methods are so extremely wild and frantic that even The Joker begs to be arrested to escape them. 

At the end of the episode, Ryder is returned to his normal self by a treatment that counteracts the chemicals, in the form of a skin patch; but it is suggested that the treatment is only temporary, and that if Ryder takes the patch off he will soon become the Creeper again. In the final seconds he stares at the patch, saying "A little piece of cotton -- hard to believe." The view then changes to outside his apartment with a silhouette of him at the window. There is the sound of paper being torn, followed by the silhouette of Ryder laughing in the manner of the Creeper -- the obvious implication being that Ryder was at least willing to return to the form of the Creeper at some point. This is a common sort of ending for a one-off villain in the series; not only is it elusive and thought provoking, but it is also in the best interests of the writers, as an ambiguous ending leaves the character available for return appearances in future episodes.

[[Image:creeper1.gif|thumb|Creeper in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]

This version of the Creeper has made cameos in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The series has a [[Justice League]] with around fifty members, including the Creeper.

[[Hasbro]] released an action figure of the [[New Batman Adventures]] version of the character in the late 1990s.

The Creeper also makes a nigh non-existent appearance in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' wherein he has already been struck fatally when we see him.
