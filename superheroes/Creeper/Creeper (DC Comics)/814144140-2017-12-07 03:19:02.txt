The '''Creeper'''  (real name '''Jack Ryder''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] created by [[Steve Ditko]] for [[DC Comics]]. He is portrayed as a former talk show host dressed in a wild costume with a green, yellow, and red color scheme. He is characterized by super strength, agility, and stamina; a healing factor enabling him to heal from virtually any wound; physically painful laughter; and proficiency in the martial arts. Most of his physical powers and abilities are the results of effects from serums and devices invented by scientist [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Vincent Yatz.]]

The Creeper [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #73 (March 1968). He later spun off into two brief series, one written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] in 1968 and another written by [[Len Kaminski]] in 1997 and 1998. In the interim, he was kept alive with sporadic appearances in solo runs and guest shots. His last comic appearance was in a six-issue miniseries written by [[Steve Niles]] in 2006. He also appeared in television shows like ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', as well as the ''[[Batman Arkham]]'' video game series.

The character's reappearance in ''[[Super-Team Family]]'' #2 in 1975/76 is unexplained, and his briefly described origin does not match the one given initially.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Shortly after his last solo issue, the Creeper teamed with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #80 (Nov. 1968), then guested in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #70 (March 1969), where it was asked whether the Creeper was an outlaw. He also appeared with Batman in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #418 (Dec. 1971).  After the origin was reprinted in ''Detective Comics'' #443 (Nov. 1974), one of the "[[DC 100 Page Super Spectacular]]" series, the Creeper's alter ego Jack Ryder was shown working as a news anchor on Gotham City television in issue #445 (March 1975), and in ''Detective Comics'' #447–448 (May–June 1975) he became the Creeper again to help Batman escape a frame-up for murder.

DC kept the character active with sporadic solo runs and guest shots over the next few years. He turned up almost immediately in issue #3 (Oct. 1975) of the [[Joker (character)|Joker's]] short-lived, [[Joker (comic book)|self-titled series]], in a story written by O'Neil, where the similarity in green hair and maniacal laughter caused confusion between the two. This was followed with a one-off solo story in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #7 (Oct. 1975), [[penciler|penciled]] by Ditko.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Jack|title=1st Issue Special: It Was No Showcase (But It Was Never Meant To Be)|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=44|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Other appearances in this period included team-ups with [[Wildcat (comics)#Earth-One|Wildcat]] in ''[[Super-Team Family]]'' #2 (Jan. 1976), again written by O'Neil; with [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #143 (Oct. 1978) and #178 (Sept. 1981); and with many fellow alumni (and a few non-graduates) of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' in that comic's 100th issue (May 1978). A story intended for the never-published ''Showcase'' #106 in 1978 (written and drawn by Ditko and which would be included in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #2) was included in ''The Creeper by Steve Ditko'' hardcover collection published by DC in 2010.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Ditko|first1= Steve|authorlink1= Steve Ditko |title= The Creeper by Steve Ditko |year= 2010 |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |isbn= 1-4012-2591-8}}</ref> Among further solos were backup series in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #445–447 (1976), ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #249–55 (1978–1979, written and fully drawn by Ditko), and ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #318–323 (1983).

Beginning in a team-up with [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #88 (Dec. 1985), written by [[Steve Englehart]]) during the
''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' company-wide story arc, the Creeper's depiction changed under different writers, which included a revised origin that was referenced but never wholly revealed.  His deranged behavior, initially an act to frighten criminals, transformed into genuine, narcotics-induced psychotic behavior. In addition, Ryder could access his enhanced physical abilities only in his costumed form, and could no longer control his transformations. The new version came into focus when the Creeper teamed with the [[Justice League International]] in 1987. A decade later, DC gave the Creeper another chance in a solo comic, ''The Creeper''.  It lasted 12 issues (December 1997&nbsp;– November 1998), including the 1998 [[DC One Million]] special numbering.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/5733/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 1997 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>  Writer [[Len Kaminski]] focused on the breakdown of Ryder's sanity under the influence of the Creeper and made many references to previous continuity.

The Creeper starred in a six-issue mini-series, ''The Creeper'' vol. 2 (October 2006&nbsp;– March 2007), written by [[Steve Niles]] and drawn by [[Justiniano]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/19429/ ''Creeper, The'' (DC 2006 series)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
'''Jack Ryder''' is a former [[Gotham City]] television [[talk show]] [[talk show host|host]] who was fired due to his outspoken nature. In ''[[Bruce Wayne: The Road Home#Outsiders|Bruce Wayne: The Road Home: Outsiders]]'', it is revealed that he once dated [[Vicki Vale]]. Finding employment in security headed by [[Bill Brane]], he attempts to rescue a scientist named [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz]] whom mobsters headed by gangster [[Angel Devlin]] have kidnapped in order to obtain his newest discoveries.  The chief mobster hosts a masquerade party at his mansion. To gain entry, Ryder improvises a costume from yellow tights and facial make-up designed to look like skin, a green wig and trunks, and red gloves, boots, and furry cloak. Ryder locates Yatz inside, but the mobsters discover him and first shoot at him, but then finally stabs him, wounding Ryder. Yatz injects Ryder with a serum and implants a device in his wound.  The serum confers the power to almost instantly heal any wound and grants Ryder enhanced strength and agility. The device, used with its activator, causes the costume to disappear, leaving Ryder naked (he can later change into his formal clothes on command). Yatz inadvertently leaves the activator out of the wound, but does not realize this until after the wound had healed. At this point, the mobsters find their victims again, this time killing Yatz. Ryder discovers that with the activator, he can regain the wild costume whenever he wishes. With it, a crazy laugh and his enhanced physical abilities, he has no trouble routing the crooks.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

As the Creeper, Ryder has a series of adventures dealing with supervillains, while hiding his secret identity from his friends and cohorts and dealing with weather girl personality [[Vera Sweet]] who also acts as his love interest.

The eventual revision of the Creeper's origin eliminated the serum and claims that the scientist surgically implanted two devices (some accounts claim a single device with two effects) that enhance Ryder's physical abilities and can recreate an object whose "imprint" is stored in its circuitry. The scientist performs this surgery to save Ryder's life after criminals he was investigating attacked and drugged him.  Because the scientist is unaware of the drugs in Ryder's system he inadvertently recorded their "imprint" at the same time he recorded the "imprint" of the costume, thus the device that recreates Ryder's costume when he becomes the Creeper also recreates the drugs in his system, explaining the Creeper's odd personality. These drugs so overwhelm Ryder's system that their effect becomes cumulative and the Creeper gradually becomes more irrational. When the Creeper changes back to Jack Ryder, the drugs disappear and with them, the psychosis. Eventually, Ryder comes to believe that he and the Creeper are two entirely different people instead of two roles played by the same man; he also holds this belief in his Creeper persona, which becomes increasingly disdainful of "Jack Ryder".  The Creeper once regained his rationality while bound by [[Wonder Woman]]'s magic lasso, but the implications of this have never been explored.

===Fighting Eclipso===
The Creeper appeared in the ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within]]'' annuals in 1992, tricked into taking up one of [[Eclipso]]'s dark crystals, putting him under Eclipso's control. He is later freed by Bruce Gordon, a longtime adversary of Eclipso. In the self-titled ''Eclipso'' comic book series, the Creeper, Gordon and his wife Mona make an initial foray into the South American territory that Eclipso has conquered. This leads to an Eclipso-possessed peasant throwing the Creeper (and himself) off a cliff. The peasant is mentally abandoned and both are left to plunge to their deaths. The intervention of a stunt squad saves the lives of both men. Several other heroes join in the fight against Eclipso, including [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]], the original [[Commander Steel|Steel]], [[Amanda Waller]], and [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Wildcat]] II. They form a team called the [[Shadow Fighters]]. In issue #13 of ''Eclipso'', a portion of the Fighters, including the Creeper, make another trip into Eclipso's territory.  Several hyenas, possessed by Eclipso, track down the Creeper and tear him to shreds. Most of the infiltration team is slain; only small parts of the Creeper are actually recovered. The remains, along with the other dead heroes, are stolen out from under Eclipso's control by surviving Shadow Fighters.

Despite this death, a Creeper series was launched in 1997. There are indications in this comic that the Dr. Yatz origin as detailed in previous appearances is somehow false and that the Creeper's actual origins are in some way related to his longtime villain, Proteus. Before this was fully explored, however, the series ceased publication.

===Rebooted origin===
In 2006, a new version of the Creeper appears in the ''Brave New World'' one shot, published following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In the one shot, Jack Ryder is now the host of a controversial TV show, ''You Are Wrong!'', promising $1,000,000 to the person who catches the Creeper.
Following this, a six-issue Creeper miniseries revealed the new origin, seemingly taking place during Batman's early years.

Ryder is said to support Dr. Vincent Yatz, who has been combining [[stem cell]] therapy and medical [[nanotechnology]] to create a revolutionary "nanocell" therapy called "smart-skin", which would enhance the body's regeneration to the point of giving new skin to burn victims and those who have suffered severe scarring. Ryder visits Yatz's lab just as the scientist is being threatened by mobsters attempting to steal the latest test batch of his newly discovered technology. Unable to escape, Yatz injects the last sample of smart-skin, still somewhat unstable, into Ryder's body in an attempt to keep it safe from the mobsters. When the criminals shoot Ryder in his head, the smart-skin activates, resurrecting Ryder moments later as the Creeper, a yellow-skinned man with superhuman physicality, green hair, and a mane of red hair growing on his back (as opposed to wearing fake red fur, like previous incarnations). The Creeper is a separate personality from Ryder and dispatches the criminals. Ryder discovers he and the Creeper can trade places, after which each acts as a witness to the other's activities and can mentally communicate with their alter ego.

Initially wanting nothing to do with the Creeper, Ryder lets him out when the yellow-skinned creature convinces him to seek revenge on their would-be killers. During their pursuit of the criminals, the Creeper and Ryder learn that Yatz has secretly intended the smart-skin to be a weapon. Side effects of its use on human subjects seems to be a loss of mental control, along with the test subjects all getting yellow skin and a mixture of red and green hair. Yatz credits these side effects on the mind and body as resulting from a nerve agent (provided by his silent partner) he had added to the nanocells. This partner is revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], who had hoped to combine his Joker venom (which causes temporary madness and usually death by laughter) and Yatz's technology to create an army of maniacal, superstrong, near-immortal soldiers. Batman and Ryder defeat the Joker, who later attacks Yatz in revenge. Batman discovers Ryder's double identity and creates a chemical agent that can cure him of the Creeper, but Ryder refuses and forms a truce with his alter ego, agreeing to let the Creeper out from time to time to fight criminals while hiding his identity from everyone including news rival and love interest [[Vera Sweet]].

===''Countdown''===
In ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis#Secondary titles|Countdown to Mystery]]'' #2, Jack Ryder is approached by [[Eclipso]] who hopes to seduce him as she did [[Plastic Man]]. She succeeds, but the Creeper is later freed from the corruption by Bruce Gordon. In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #24 (2007), the Creeper is seen, along with other heroes, fighting members of the [[Sinestro Corps]] in the streets of [[New York City|New York]].

===''Reign in Hell''===
During the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' miniseries, the Creeper was presented as a demon that co-inhabited the body of Jack Ryder rather than an identity he assumed due to scientific experimentation. The story shows the Creeper demon separating from Jack Ryder, having been recalled to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] by [[Lilith]], the mother of all earthborn atrocities. It is later revealed that the Creeper demon is just one of a similar looking species of demon. The ''Reign in Hell'' storyline had many continuity errors that made its place in DC Comics canon questionable and the idea that the Creeper was a demonic entity was not repeated afterward.

===Outsiders===
The Creeper has joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].<ref>''The Outsiders'' #15 (April 2009)</ref> Later, the Creeper is one of the many heroes recruited to keep the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] from exploiting his resemblance to Bruce Wayne. The Creeper is disguised as a high-level employee of WayneCorp, an excuse for him to accompany "Wayne".<ref>''Batman Streets of Gotham'' #4 (November 2009)</ref>

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]], a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe continuity, the Creeper's origin was explained in ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' #23.1 which was retitled ''Creeper'' #1 as part of the "Forever Evil" event.<ref name="Villains Month Buzzfeed">{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/dan-didio-and-jim-lee-talk-dcs-september-event-villain-month |title=Dan DiDio and Jim Lee Talk DC’s September Event, Villain Month |last=Ringerud |first=Tanner |date=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref> In that issue, it is revealed that the Creeper originated as an [[oni]] in [[feudal Japan]] who "justifies cruel temper tantrums under the guise of spreading chaos."<ref name="Justice League Dark #23.1: The Creeper Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/05/justice-league-dark-231-the-creeper-review| title= ''Justice League Dark'' #23.1: The Creeper Review |last=Schedeen|first=Jesse |date=14 December 2014 |publisher= IGN.com |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>

The Creeper first appeared as a cameo appearance as one of Andre Brigg's candidates for a United Nations–sanctioned Justice League. However, the Creeper was not selected to join the group.<ref>''Justice League International'' Vol. 3 #1 (November 2011)</ref>

Jack Ryder appeared in ''Phantom Stranger'' #7, where he had recently quit his job as a talk show host at [[Morgan Edge]]'s network. After intervention from the [[Phantom Stranger]], Ryder ends up being killed by a monster's attack on Metropolis.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #7 (June 2013)</ref> The [[Presence (DC Comics)|Presence]], in the form of a dog, notes that the Stranger did not lead a man to his death, but to his destiny and that Ryder's story is not yet over.

In ''[[Katana (comics)|Katana]]'' #3 (June 2013), after Katana's sword is broken by [[Killer Croc]], the spirit of the Creeper is released from the captivity of her sword. It revealed that Katana's sword was used to kill the Creeper. In the following issue, the Creeper is seen bonding to Jack Ryder's dead body. The Creeper notes that he had used Ryder's body previously, calling him "old friend". He later confronts Katana and then retreats.<ref>''Katana'' #4 (July 2013)</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
In the rebooted continuity of the 2017 initiative [[DC Rebirth]], Jack Ryder appears to be back to his original pre-New 52 version from before. While investigating a series of murdered criminals down in Chicago, Ryder ends up transforming into the Creeper again and battling against a [[Deathstroke]] copycat; while running into the real Deathstroke at the same time. In ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' he is a member recruited by Bizarro.

==Powers and abilities==
===Original===
The Creeper's powers are physical in nature and a result of [[Vincent Yatz|Dr. Yatz's]] inventions. He displays virtually superhuman agility and stamina, combined with strength. This enables him to perform amazing feats of acrobatics and leaping. He also seems to be able to climb sheer walls with little or no difficulty. His strength is enough to enable him to throw grown men several feet or jump several feet in the air. His speed and reflexes have also been enhanced greatly. These combined abilities make the Creeper a formidable fighter, incorporating brawling techniques with his physical prowess. A signature move of his is jumping onto the backs of his opponents and throwing them off balance. The Creeper also possesses a superhuman healing factor, which enables him to heal from virtually any wound; gunshots and stab wounds healing within a matter of minutes. It even allowed him to return from death when his body regenerated after being torn apart by Eclipsed hyenas. Also, his laugh is depicted as being physically painful to the ears of his victims, causing a psychotic comatose state.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

===Current===
According to the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, the Creeper form of Jack Ryder is actually a member of a unique demonic species who all share similar physical characteristics. This idea was dismissed by other writers and in the retcon origin by Steve Niles, the Creeper was the result of Yatz's experiments and had the same powers as his original incarnation, along with a laugh that seemed to disorient opponents.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Other versions==
The 2003 series ''[[Beware the Creeper]]'', which is set in 1920s [[Paris]], features a female Creeper.

The Creeper makes a cameo appearance in the 2001-2002 miniseries ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', wherein he has already been struck fatally. He is impaled by [[Dick Grayson|"Joker Boy"]] as part of a revenge scheme against Batman.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

In the 1996 miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', The Creeper appears as an elderly metahuman who works for [[Batman]]'s [[Outsiders (comics)|rogue faction of metahumans]].<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

In the 1998 miniseries ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', where the public has been convinced that metahumans are alien invaders thanks to a smear campaign masterminded by [[Lex Luthor]] and a part-Kryptonian [[Jimmy Olsen]], the Creeper is imprisoned by [[Cadmus Labs]], [[Lois Lane]] noting that she once saw him save a family from a psychotic gunman.<ref>''JLA: The Nail'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

In the year 85,271 depicted in the 1998 "[[DC One Million]]" storyline, on the planet IAI, an entity known as RYDR senses a disturbance that may unravel all that is and transforms into its other, the sum total of collective unreason, shamanic avatar and raw distillate of madness known as The Creeper. The trail leads to present day Jack Ryder, who was tired of being a superhero. Jack and The Creeper became separate parts of each other, actual living beings. After The Creeper side kept splitting into bizarre and dangerous alternate Creepers each representing a different part of The Creeper's personality, Jack realized that whether he liked it or not, the Creeper was a part of him. The future Creeper ingested all the alternate Creepers, but realizing the truth of the event, he returned them to the original Creeper and told him and Jack Ryder to remerge, and The Creeper was reborn. The future Creeper returns to IAI with the last remaining alternate Creeper, the one representing self-loathing, which he disposes of before transforming back into RYDR to catalogue the event.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

In the [[Tangent Comics]] universe, the Earth-9 version of the Creeper is a powerful warlock and member of occult organization known as the Black Circle.  In one of the possible origin stories for the Earth-9 version of the Green Lantern, Creeper and the other members of the Black Circle task Zatanna to retrieve the mystical Green Lantern.<ref>''Tangent Comics:  Tales of the Green Lantern'' #1 (Sept 1998). DC Comics.</ref>

[[Nightcreeper]] (Kurt "Jack" Ryder) of [[Amalgam Comics]] combines DC's Creeper with [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].  Nightcreeper's "in-universe" first appearance is ''JLA: The New Blood''; his actual real world appearance was in ''JLX'' #1 (1996).  He is a member of the JLX, an amalgamation of DC's [[Justice League of America]] and Marvel's [[X-Men]].

In the alternate timeline of the 2011 ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' storyline, Jack Ryder is in [[news broadcasting]]. He sends a message that [[Wonder Woman]] leads the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] in conquering the [[United Kingdom]], renaming it New [[Themyscira (DC Comics)#New Themyscira|Themyscira]] during the war.<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011).
