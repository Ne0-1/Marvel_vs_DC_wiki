'''Xombi''' is a [[Milestone Media|Milestone Comics]] [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Xombi'' #0, (January 1994), and was created by [[John Rozum]] and [[Denys Cowan]].{{fact|date=July 2008}}



==Fictional character biography==
Xombi was a Korean-American scientist named David Kim from [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. He developed a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] virus capable of extensive tissue regeneration. Before David Kim could test his invention, a villain named Dr. Sugarman broke into his lab and tried to steal the virus. In the fight, David Kim was critically injured, and his assistant injected him with the virus in an attempt to save his life. However, since the nanites used available matter to restore David, his assistant&mdash;who had laid his body on her lap&mdash;was partially "devoured" by the nanites. He became a "xombi" - a potentially immortal, technologically enhanced human being. Somehow, this embroiled him the affairs of various races of supernatural beings that secretly lived among humanity for [[millennia]], known collectively as the shadow worlds.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
{{see also|Infinite Crisis}}
Due to the combined effect of the destruction and recreation of the [[DC Multiverse|Multiverse]] and the timeline-altering powers of Anansi, a new divergent timeline was created in which David Kim, ''the most worthy man alive'', became [[Green Lantern]] instead of [[Hal Jordan]]. Kim was one of a group of alternate [[Justice League]] members who helped restore the original timeline. 

It is still unknown if David Kim in the new continuity was ever Xombi to begin with.
