'''Xombi''' was a [[Milestone Media|Milestone Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[John Rozum]], he first appeared in ''Xombi'' #0 (1994). The comic was cancelled after 21 issues.

Despite the fact that ''Xombi'' was the lowest-selling title Milestone Media ever published, it maintained a cult following throughout its run.  A Xombi is someone who has became immortal by artificial means.  

Xombi was a Korean-American scientist named David Kim from West Orange, New Jersey. He developed a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] virus capable of extensive tissue regeneration. Before David Kim could test his invention, a villain named Dr. Sugarman broke into his lab and tried to steal the virus. In the fight, David Kim was critically injured, and his assistant injected him with the virus in an attempt to save his life. He became a "xombi" - a potentially immortal, technologically enhanced human being. Somehow, this embroiled him the affairs of various races of supernatural beings that secretly lived among humanity for [[millennia]], known collectively as the shadow worlds.
