'''Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] army hero and [[spy]], featured in [[Marvel Comics]]. 

Ultimate Nick Fury is a reinterpretation of the classic Marvel character [[Nick Fury]].  The most notable difference between the two is the fact that Classic Fury is [[caucasian]], while Ultimate Fury is [[black (people)|African-american]], and seems to be in fact specifically tailored after actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]].  

Fury features heavily in all Ultimates books; initially appearing in ''Ultimate X-Men'', then later appearing in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' and finally being the founder and leader of ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]'', a re-imagining of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and Marvel's current #1-selling title.

==History==
Ultimate Nick Fury's history has not been as clearly established as continuity Nick Fury, however his earliest appearance indicates that he was involved with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Weapon X program in the original [[Gulf War]].  Transporting [[Wolverine_(comics)#Ultimate_Marvel_version|Wolverine]] presumably to the front lines, an Iraqi guerilla ambush freed Wolverine from his cage, whereupon Wolverine slaughtered all the Iraqi fighters.  Only one member of the US forces survived the ambush: Nick Fury.  It was in this ambush that Fury lost an eye and from then on would be portrayed with his trademark eyepatch.  Carrying Fury through the desert back to allied forces, Wolverine was thanked for his work by being repeatedly shot, caged once more, and returned to the battlefront.  Still, a bond was forged between the two men.

The relationship between Fury and Wolverine would prove beneficial to the X-Men years later when they were imprisoned by the Weapon X program. Wolverine, the only X-Man not captured, contacted Fury for help. The X-Men and the other Weapon X mutants broke out and as Wraith was about to shoot Nightcrawler, Fury appeared with a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and shot the project leader, Wraith.  Wraith had previously seemed to have killed General Ross earlier for cancelling the Weapon X program. Later, Ross showed up in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' with the explanation that he woke in the mortuary and told the person attending to him, ''"Hands off my precious bodily fluids, soldier."''

With Ross (seemingly) dead, Fury became the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. His first plan was to resurrect the Super Soldier program. The result was the [[Ultimates]]. Fury commands the team - and has been seen to lead them into action. In addition Nick Fury also monitors the activity of Peter Parker (Ultimate Spider-Man) and the X-Men. Fury's future plans for these young post-humans, in part, are for them to join the Ultimates.

==Technologies==
Fury has no trace of the Infinity Formula or other enhancements that the regular continuity's Fury has claimed.  He operates with technology years ahead of traditional forces, including the latest experimental weaponry, and some form of projected invisibility and the ability to walk through solid matter. These powers have very limited windows due to massive expense for any moment of 'uptime;' costs for these literally burn millions per microsecond.  Fury is constantly monitored and shadowed by dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and all observation technology known - and a few that are not.

==Movies and Television ==
An upcoming Marvel video feature entitled ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' will feature Ultimate Nick Fury and will be voiced by [[Andre Ware (Actor)|Andre Ware]] who also did Fury's voice for the 2005 game ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. Ultimate Fury also be made an appearance on the newly released ''X-Men: Legends 2'' video game.
