[[General (United States)|General]] '''Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] military officer, Gulf War veteran and [[spy]], featured in [[Marvel Comics]].

Ultimate Nick Fury is a reinterpretation of the classic Marvel character [[Nick Fury]]. A notable difference between the two is the fact that Classic Fury is white with brown hair, while Ultimate Fury is black and bald, and was in fact specifically tailored after actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] with his permission.<ref>http://www.samuelljackson.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=44</ref> While his eyepatch is generally worn over his left eye (consistent with his mainstream Marvel counterpart), it has occasionally switched to his right in some comics. 

Fury has a heavy presence in all the ''Ultimates'' books, appearing first in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' and ''Ultimate X-Men'' and later reappearing in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' and finally securing a regular, recurring role as the General of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the leader of [[Ultimates|The Ultimates]], a re-imagining of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ultimate Nick Fury's history has not been as clearly established as [[Earth-616]] Nick Fury, but some information is known. After attending college in [[India]], Fury enlisted in the military and was assigned to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Weapon X program in the original [[Gulf War]]. He has also claimed within the pages of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' that he had once worked at Burger King, and regretted it; this was presumably before going to his Indian college.  While transporting [[Wolverine (comics)#Ultimate Marvel version|Wolverine]] in his adamantium cage, an Iraqi guerilla ambush killed his team and inadvertently freed Wolverine from his prison. After slaughtering the Iraqi guards, Wolverine discovered Fury, the only survivor of the ambush, and transported him back through the desert to the Allied forces. Although Wolverine was summarily subdued and reimprisoned by his handlers, a bond between the two men was formed.

The relationship between Fury and Wolverine would prove essential years later when the X-Men were abducted and imprisoned by the Weapon X program. This program was overseen at the time by [[John Wraith|Wraith]], who had previously staged a coup against General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Ross]]. This coup had prevented Ross from dismantling the Weapon X program altogether. Wolverine, the only X-Man who eludes capture, later asks Fury for help in freeing the other X-Men and bringing down the Weapon X program. During the operation, which also involves the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], Wraith was about to kill one of the X-Men and is shot dead by Fury.

Fury is summarily promoted to [[General]] and resumes the duties of the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was tasked with forming a team to battle metahuman threats and resurrecting the [[supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] program, two objectives that resulted in the formation of the [[Ultimates]]. Fury operates as the commander of the team, at times leading them into action, though he often shares duties with Captain America. Nick Fury is also responsible for monitoring metahumans who are not affiliated with the U.S. Military, including [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and the X-Men.

Nick Fury recently lost his right arm in a battle against the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] in [[Ultimates#Volume 2|''Ultimates ''Vol. 2]]. However, in story arcs that appear to be set after this, he has 2 arms - in issue #107 of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', after Peter tells Ben Urich and J. Jonah Jameson that his house has just been trashed and his aunt is in the hospital, Ben asks if it was "the Ultimates thing", likely meaning the "Grand Theft America" arc of Ultimates 2, in which Fury lost his arm.  Fury may have gotten a prosthetic arm by this time, however.

Nick Fury has also been involved in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics.  In them he meets Peter after Norman Osborn returns.  He states that S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to figure out who Peter was because of the security shots of the Oz Spider biting Peter, as well as Dr. Octopus screaming that Peter Parker is Spider-Man while in jail.  Nick Fury has been watching Peter as he will eventually be property of S.H.I.E.L.D due to him being an illegal mutant. Although Fury wants him to be part of the Ultimates, this may have changed due to the fact that the Ultimates broke apart. Peter and Fury's relationship became strained after the Hobgoblin arc.  Peter punches Fury for ignoring his questions for why Harry became the Hobgoblin.  At that point Fury told one of his scientists that he wanted to know everything about Oz and that it was time for Peter Parker to lose his Spider powers.  This follows on to the Clone Saga in which it is revealed by Fury that the Tinkerer's Spider Slayers were developed to handle Peter if and when he ever went insane; after learning that Pete, who idolises Fury, is not an immediate threat to him or S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick decides against removing his powers.  It can be assumed that he's on somewhat good terms with Peter Parker.

==Technologies==
Fury has no trace of the Infinity Formula or other enhancements that the regular continuity's Fury has claimed. He is an exceptional combatant and strategist and a gifted field leader. He operates with technology years ahead of traditional forces, including the latest experimental weaponry, and some form of projected invisibility and the ability to walk through solid matter. These powers have very limited windows due to massive expense for any moment of 'uptime;' costs for these literally burn millions of dollars per microsecond. He once used a [[chewing gum]] that was programmed to explode after 200 chews. Fury is constantly monitored and shadowed by dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and all observation technology known - and a few that are not.

==Design changes==
[[Image:First_Ultimate_Fury.jpg|frame|right|The original design for Ultimate Nick Fury]]
When Nick Fury first made his appearance in the Ultimate Universe, he had a vastly different design and was characterizated much more in the [[James Bond]] mold of super-spy. The more familiar Samuel L. Jackson inspired design didn't appear until Nick Fury resurfaced in the Ultimates. It's also worth noting that despite having appeared in previous Ultimate marvel books, [[Iron Man]] and [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] were both redesigned in the new launch as well. This so far unexplained 'replacement' of characters may feature in [[Brian Michael Bendis]]' 2007 mini-series, ''Ultimate Origin'', which promises to both explain the mysteries of the Ultimate Universe and provide revelations about Fury himself.

==Movies and television ==
* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] gave his consent for Marvel Comics to design their "Ultimate" version of the character Nick Fury after his likeness. When discussing in 'The Ultimates' #4 who they thought would play them in an in-universe Ultimates movie, Nick Fury's first choice was Samuel L. Jackson. In the 2008 motion picture release of ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' Jackson will play Fury. 
* A Marvel straight-to-DVD feature movie entitled ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' and its sequel ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]''  features Ultimate Nick Fury, voiced by [[Andre Ware]] who also did Fury's voice for the 2005 game ''[[Fantastic Four (video game)|Fantastic Four]]''.
* [[Dave Fennoy]] provided the voice of Ultimate Fury in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man video game]]''.
* A version of Fury identical to the Ultimate one also made an appearance in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' video game, voiced by [[Khary Payton]].
* This version of Fury is available as a skin for the playable Nick Fury in the ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' video game
