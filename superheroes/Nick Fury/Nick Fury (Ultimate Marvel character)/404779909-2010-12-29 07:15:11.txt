'''General Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury''' is a [[fictional character]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A reinterpretation of the  character [[Nick Fury]], one of the most notable differences between the two is that the mainstream Nick Fury is a [[Caucasian American]] [[colonel]] with greying brown hair, while this Nick Fury is a bald [[African American]] [[general]], specifically tailored after actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] with his permission.<ref>[http://www.samuelljackson.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=44 Samuel L. Jackson's Official Site - August 2005 Interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Jackson appeared as Fury in a [[post-credits scene]] in the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' and as a supporting character in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''. Fury has a substantial presence in all the ''Ultimates'' comics, appearing first in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' and ''Ultimate X-Men'' and later reappearing regularly in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' and finally securing a regular, recurring role as the General of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the leader of the [[Ultimates]], a re-imagining of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

==Fictional character biography==
{{In-universe|date=August 2010}}
Nicholas Fury fought for the United States in [[World War II]]. During the [[invasion of Sicily]], he, along with Private [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Fisk]] and Canadian paratrooper Corporal [[Wolverine (comics)|Howlett]] attempted to loot a house. American Military police arrived to arrest them, and all three were subdued. Fisk was grazed by a bullet, while Fury was imprisoned in an unknown location alongside several other black men and Howlett, despite protests that he was Canadian, was also shipped to an unknown location.<ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #1</ref> Fury was selected to be the next test subject for Project Rebirth, as his blood work most closely matched that of subject 22, the most successful of the previous test subjects. He was injected with a serum that gave him super-strength, which he used to free himself and the other prisoners, who then escaped. The scientists who were working on him let him escape, deciding that they have all the information that they needed for now.

After attending college in [[India]], Fury enlisted in the U.S. military, where he was deployed into various conflicts such as the [[Kosovo War]]s. He was later assigned to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Weapon X]] program in the original [[Gulf War]]. While transporting [[Wolverine (comics)#Ultimate Marvel version|Wolverine]] in his [[adamantium]] cage, an Iraqi guerrilla ambush killed his team and inadvertently freed Wolverine from his prison. After slaughtering the Iraqi guards, Wolverine discovered Fury, the only survivor of the ambush, and transported him back through the desert to the Allied forces. Although Wolverine was summarily subdued and re-imprisoned by his handlers, a bond between the two men was formed.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men: Return to Weapon X">Ultimate X-Men: Return to Weapon X</ref>

Years later the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] were abducted and imprisoned by the Weapon X program. This program was overseen at the time by [[John Wraith|Wraith]], who had previously staged a coup against [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]]. This coup had prevented Ross from dismantling the Weapon X program altogether. Wolverine, the only X-Man who eludes capture, later asks Fury for help in freeing the other X-Men and bringing down the Weapon X program. During the operation, which also involves the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], Wraith was about to kill one of the X-Men and is shot dead by Fury<ref name="Ultimate X-Men: Return to Weapon X"/>.

Fury is summarily promoted to [[General]] and resumes the duties of the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was tasked with forming a team to battle posthuman threats and resurrecting the [[supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] program, two objectives that resulted in the formation of the [[Ultimates]]. Fury operates as the commander of the team, at times leading them into action, though he often shares duties with [[Captain America]]. Nick Fury is also responsible for monitoring [[posthuman]]s who are not affiliated with the U.S. Military, including [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and the X-Men.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Nick Fury lost his right arm in a battle against the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] in [[Ultimates#Volume 2|''Ultimates '' (vol. 2)]]. However, in story arcs that appear to be set after this, he has two arms, including issue #107 of ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. The ''Ultimate Secrets'' guide claims that Fury replaced his right arm with a bionic one.

Nick Fury has also been involved in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' comics. In them he meets Peter after [[Alternate versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Norman Osborn]] returns. He states that S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to figure out who Peter was because of the security shots of the Oz Spider biting Peter, as well as [[Dr. Octopus]] screaming that Peter Parker is Spider-Man while in jail. Nick Fury has been watching Peter and informs him that, due to his illegal genetically altered status, he will become the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he turns 18. Although Fury wants him to be part of the Ultimates, this may have changed because the Ultimates broke apart. Peter and Fury's relationship became strained after the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] arc. Peter punches Fury for ignoring his questions for why [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] became the Hobgoblin. At that point Fury told one of his scientists that he wanted to know everything about Oz and that it was time for Peter Parker to lose his Spider powers. This follows on to the Ultimate Clone Saga in which it is revealed by Fury that the [[Tinkerer]]'s [[Spider-Slayer]]s were developed to handle Peter if and when he ever went insane. [[Mary Jane Watson]] tells Fury that Peter idolized Fury and would never threaten Fury and his various agendas for the Ultimate Marvel Universe's super-powered beings. This convinced Fury to let Peter keep his powers and to leave Peter alone. {{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Fury was judged to be at least partially responsible for the devastation of much of [[Earth-31916]] along with [[Emil Burbank#Supreme_Power|Emil Burbank]]. Burbank had sought a means to defeat the [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] of that universe. An alien organism, unleashed in an attempt to achieve this, spread throughout the United States causing widespread devastation. A probe sent by [[Reed Richards#Ultimate Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]] provided evidence that an "invasion from another universe" was responsible. The [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]] was dispatched to the Ultimate universe in order to arrest Richards so that he could stand trial for his 'crimes'. A lengthy battle ensued between the Squadron on one side and the [[Ultimates]], [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]], and the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]] on the other. Richards, believing himself to be responsible when the Squadron produced his probe as evidence, surrendered himself. Fury was unwilling to accept this and convinced [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] to create a bridge to Earth-31916 through which the [[Helicarrier]] was able to travel. Once there, another battle between the Squadron and the Ultimate universe heroes begins. Spider-Man learns that Fury had an ulterior motive - the retrieval of the probes and their data, and had conspired with [[Alternate versions of Doctor Doom#Ultimate Marvel|Doctor Doom]] to do so. In addition, Fury had brought insurance in the shape of the [[Alternate versions of Hulk#Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]]. It takes the combined power of the Ultimate universe heroes, the Earth-31916 Squadron Supreme, and [[Squadron Supreme|their counterparts from Earth-712]] to defeat the Hulk, but Doom had proven to be simply a [[Doombot]]. To stop the fighting, the Ultimates agree to turn over Fury to the Earth-31916 Squadron and to allow [[Power Princess#Power Princess: Supreme Power|Power Princess]] to return with them to their universe. Fury tries to convince them that they are making a mistake, but his pleas are ignored.<ref>''Ultimate Power'' #1-9</ref>

Fury is seen still stranded in Earth-31916 in ''Squadron Supreme'' v2 #1. He has apparently fulfilled the prophecy made by Hyperion in ''Ultimate Power'' #9: "Given the strength of our military industrial complex, Fury would have risen here to even greater heights than your homeworld." <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=9099 ''SQUADRON SUPREME 2'' #1 - Marvel Comics Publishing Catalog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Fury returns to the Ultimate Universe in Ultimatum #4 and is instrumental in defeating [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]. [[Alternate versions of Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Jean Grey]] telepathically relays the information discovered by Fury in Ultimate Origins that mutants are not the next stage in human evolution, but are in fact the result of experimentation done by humans. This revelation causes Magneto to reverse the damage done to the Earth's magnetic poles.

Following the events of Ultimatum, Fury is informed by [[Hawkeye (comics)#Other versions|Hawkeye]] about how [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] discovered the secret of the [[Red Skull#Ultimate Red Skull|Red Skull]]. Fury asks head of S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Ms. Marvel#Ultimate Marvel|Carol Danvers]] for permission to start up a 'death squad' in order to catch the Red Skull and Cap.

==Abilities and technologies==
Fury was not initially shown to use the Infinity Formula or other physical enhancements that the Nick Fury of the mainstream Marvel universe possessed. He is an exceptional combatant and strategist and a gifted field leader. In his earliest appearances he operated with technology years ahead of traditional forces, including the latest experimental weaponry, and some form of projected invisibility and the ability to walk through solid matter. These powers have very limited windows due to massive expense for any moment of 'uptime;' costs for these run to the millions for less than a minute of use. He once used a [[chewing gum]] that was programmed to explode after 200 chews. The number of instances in which Fury uses these technologies has decreased since ''[[Ultimates]]'' #1, and Fury is shown to primarily use conventional firearms. Fury is constantly monitored and shadowed by dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and all known observation technologies.

==Publication history==
===Design changes===
[[Image:First Ultimate Fury.jpg|frame|right|The original design for Ultimate Nick Fury.]]
When Nick Fury first made his appearance in the Ultimate Universe he had a vastly different design, featuring a full head of close-cropped hair, a clean-shaven, younger appearance (particularly as depicted in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'') and less visible scarring around his eye-patch, not to mention lacking a specific resemblance to any actor.  He was also characterized much more in the [[James Bond]] mold of super-spy<ref>Ultimate X-Men vol 1 HC</ref>, wearing seemingly normal clothing which integrated outlandishly high-tech capabilities such as phasing, invisibility, and "para-shoes" that allow him to descend hundreds of feet without the aid of a parachute (shown to be capable of flight in later issues). The more familiar Samuel L. Jackson-inspired design did not appear until Nick Fury resurfaced in the 2002 ''[[Ultimates]]'' series.

===Samuel L. Jackson===
Actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] gave his consent for [[Marvel Comics]] to use his likeness in their redesign of the Fury character for ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]''<ref name="samueljackson">{{cite web

</ref>, and first appeared with this revised look in ''Ultimates'' #1, as drawn by [[Bryan Hitch]]. The similarity is even noted within the comic itself, in a scene in which the Ultimates discuss who they think should play each of them in a hypothetical movie about the team. Fury's answer for himself is "Mr. Samuel L. Jackson, of course, no discussion."

==In other media==

==Comics==
* In ''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' #13, Nick Fury (of the [[Earth-616]] universe) uses a disguise that is similar in appearance to Ultimate Fury. This receives comment from [[Daisy Johnson]] as "his worst disguise ever." Conversely, in "Ultimate Mystery", it is the ultimate version of the character who disguises himself, resembling his 616-counterpart... and gets exactly the same  comment.
