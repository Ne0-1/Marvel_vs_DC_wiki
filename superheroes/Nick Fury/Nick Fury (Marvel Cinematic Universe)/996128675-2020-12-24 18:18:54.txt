Jackson]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Nick Fury|of the same name]]. Prior to taking the role, Marvel incorporated Jackson's likeness into the design of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|of the character]].

{{As of|2020}}, Fury has appeared in eleven of twenty-three MCU films, beginning with the first MCU film, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', in 2008, and most recently appearing in ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' in 2019. He will also appear in a leading role for the upcoming [[Disney+]] show ''[[Secret Invasion (TV series)|Secret Invasion]]''.

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
Fury originally appeared in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]] and writer [[Stan Lee]], Fury [[first appeared]] in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #1 (May 1963), a [[World War II]] [[war comics|combat series]] that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite [[U.S. Army]] unit. In 1998, [[David Hasselhoff]] portrayed Fury in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[television movie]] ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The MCU version of Nick Fury jettisoned a number of details from the original comic book version. Aside from the original character having been white (a detail already changed in the comics before the MCU came to fruition), the original comic book Nick Fury was a World War II veteran who knew [[Captain America]] and led the [[Howling Commandos]], and lost sight in his left eye during a grenade attack in that war. In both the original comic book and the Ultimate Marvel versions, Fury was able to remain active many decades after the war because he aged unnaturally slowly due to regular doses of an Infinity Formula.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.looper.com/144989/the-untold-truth-of-nick-fury/|title=The untold truth of Nick Fury|first=Mike|last=Floorwalker|publisher=Looper|date=February 7, 2019|access-date=June 12, 2020|archive-date=June 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612002555/https://www.looper.com/144989/the-untold-truth-of-nick-fury/|url-status=live}}</ref> A popular character over a number of decades, in 2011, Fury was ranked 33rd in [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes",<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/33|title= Nick Fury – #33 Top Comic Book Heroes|publisher= IGN|archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/6Ec64ySqU?url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/33|archive-date= February 22, 2013|url-status= live|accessdate= May 29, 2012}}</ref> and 32nd in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |date= April 30, 2012|title= The Top 50 Avengers |url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/32|publisher= IGN|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117074539/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/32|archive-date= November 17, 2015|url-status= live |accessdate= July 28, 2015}}</ref> He has sometimes been considered an antihero.

Fury first appears in the [[post-credits scene]] of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), meeting [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] at his Malibu home to discuss the Avengers Initiative.<ref name="IronFury">{{cite news |last1=Vary |first1=Adam B. |last2=Collis |first2=Clark |title=The Success of 'Iron Man' |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=https://ew.com/article/2008/05/09/success-iron-man/ |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 2, 2019 |archive-date=June 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608200737/https://ew.com/article/2008/05/09/success-iron-man/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), Fury sends in [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] to pose as an assistant to and assess Stark to see if he is worth recruiting for the Initiative and helps Stark deal with his palladium illness and Ivan Vanko and at the end of the film hires him as a consultant for the Avengers Initiative. Fury makes a cameo in the post-credits scene of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', enlisting [[Erik Selvig]] to study the Tesseract. At the end of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), Fury informs [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]]: "You've been asleep, Cap, for almost seventy years." He later appears in the post-credits scene to propose a mission to Rogers which leads into ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), the first MCU film where Fury appears as a main character in the film, rather than in a cameo or post-credits scene. In the film, when [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives on Earth to take the Tesseract in order to lead the [[Chitauri]] invasion, Fury brings the titular team together. Noting that he does more in ''The Avengers'' than in any of the previous films: "You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me". About the role, Jackson said, "It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem." Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in ''[[Jackie Brown]]'', calling him "a nice guy to hang out with. You just don't want to cross him".<ref>{{cite news|date=August 4, 2011|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/14404633|title=Samuel L.

In 2013 and 2014, Jackson appeared as Fury in two episodes of the MCU spinoff TV series, ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', "[[0-8-4]]" (2013) and "[[Beginning of the End (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Beginning of the End]]" (2014). In "0-8-4", Fury appears in an end tag to scold [[Phil Coulson|Agent Coulson]] over damage caused to a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane during a fight, and expresses his doubts over the loyalty of [[Daisy Johnson]]. In June 2013, [[Samuel L.

Regarding Fury's questionable code of ethics displayed in the film, Jackson said, "Almost everything that comes out of Nick Fury's mouth is a lie in some sense.

A younger version of Fury appears in ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019), which is set in 1995, when Fury is still a low-level [[bureaucrat]].<ref name="EWGreggSept2018">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/13/clark-gregg-captain-marvel/|title=Clark Gregg teases Coulson and Fury's 'meet-cute' in Captain Marvel|last=Coggan|first=Devan|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 13, 2018|access-date=September 13, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/72PVZcYVz?url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/13/clark-gregg-captain-marvel/|archive-date=September 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Fury appears without his signature eye patch as the film is set before he loses his eye.<ref name="2017SDCC">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/captain-marvel-brie-larson-90s-prequel-1202503813/|title='Captain Marvel' Will Be Set in the '90s With Skrulls as Villains|last=Lang|first=Brent|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 22, 2017|access-date=July 22, 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6sA1Enkbk?url=http://variety.com/2017/film/news/captain-marvel-brie-larson-90s-prequel-1202503813/|archive-date=July 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Feige explained that Danvers is the first superhero that Fury has come across,<ref name="FeigeMar2018">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/03/09/marvel-studios-kevin-feige-mcu-future/|title=Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige on the future of Black Panther, Captain Marvel, X-Men – and beyond|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 9, 2018|access-date=March 9, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6xnHhrUw5?url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/03/09/marvel-studios-kevin-feige-mcu-future/|archive-date=March 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which sets him on a path to his role working with heroes in later-set MCU films.<ref name="FeigeApr2018">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/captain-marvel-90s-kevin-feige-brie-larson-1202785738/|title=Why 'Captain Marvel' Is Deeply Important to Nick Fury|last=Brockington|first=Ariana|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 24, 2018|access-date=April 27, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6z02dTCeW?url=http://variety.com/2018/film/news/captain-marvel-90s-kevin-feige-brie-larson-1202785738/|archive-date=April 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Jackson described Fury at this point as a desk jockey, who has not yet become cynical towards bureaucracy and who learns in the film that there are superpowered beings who could help S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/07/captain-marvel-samuel-l-jackson-young-nick-fury/|title=Samuel L.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early developments===
In 1995, [[Kree]] Empire [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] crash-lands in Los Angeles, drawing [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents Nick Fury and [[Phil Coulson]] to investigate. In an ensuing [[Skrull]] attack, Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Skrull commander [[Talos the Untamed|Talos]], disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her. Vers, escaping capture by the Skrull, uses memories they have extracted to bring Fury to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental jet engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as a woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Later, Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. Danvers is captured by Starforce, and in the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury's face, blinding his left eye. Danvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], "Avenger".

Later, Fury "became the Deputy Chief of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Bogotá]] station", where he "proved his leadership mettle" by engineering the rescue of hostages captured by Colombian rebels at the country's embassy, including the daughter of then-S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Alexander Pierce]]: 

{{quote|Fury came up with a plan to get the hostages out. Pierce nixed the idea, preferring to negotiate with the rebels, but Fury ignored those orders and implemented his plan anyway. Fortunately, all the hostages were freed, and despite being disobeyed, Pierce was impressed with how Fury handled the crisis and promoted him to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he stepped down to take a spot on the World Security Council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456051/captain-marvel-what-we-know-so-far-about-nick-furys-past|title=Captain Marvel: What We Know So Far About Nick Fury's Past|date=August 20, 2018|publisher=CinemaBlend|access-date=September 20, 2019|archive-date=September 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920144530/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456051/captain-marvel-what-we-know-so-far-about-nick-furys-past|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

===Assembling the Avengers and fighting Hydra===
Over a decade later, after [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] reveals himself to be the hero known as Iron Man, Fury visits Stark in his home and recruits him into the Avengers initiative. Similarly, after [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] is recovered from decades of being frozen, Fury oversees the waking of Rogers, and his reintroduction to society. After Stark is attacked by Russian weapons designer Ivan Vanko, Fury approaches Stark, revealing that Stark's recently acquired new assistant "Natalie Rushman" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Tony's father Howard was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father Anton and Howard invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Howard had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Tony Stark some of his father's old material, enabling Stark to synthesize a new element for his arc reactor that ends his palladium dependency. At a debriefing after Vanko is defeated, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant.

Following [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]'s brief banishment from Asgard to Earth, Fury also enlists [[Erik Selvig]] to study the Tesseract. Fury is present when [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] attacks a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility to steal the Tesseract and take control of [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]]. Fury calls in Romanoff and arranges the bringing together of Stark, Rogers, and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to fight the threat Loki poses. After Loki is captured in Germany and then kills Coulson while escaping from confinement on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the remaining Avengers to work as a team, leading to their stand against Loki and his invading Chitauri army in New York City. When the World Security Council authorizes the nuclear bombing of the city to defeat the invasion, Fury uses a rocket launcher to take out one of the two jets launching for that mission, but is too late to stop the second, which fires a missile that is instead intercepted by Stark. After Loki's defeat, Fury authorizes the use of alien technology to resurrect Coulson from death.

Some time later, an attempt is made on Fury's life by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], which is revealed to have taken over S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury is apparently killed. After it is revealed that Alexander Pierce is working for Hydra, Fury reappears to override Hydra's control of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s computer systems, forcing Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Fury reveals that although Pierce had deleted Fury's retinal scan from the system, Fury had a backup scan of his destroyed other eye. Once Hydra's plan to control the world is foiled, Fury appears to assist S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the aftermath of those events, rescuing agents [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] from drowning in the ocean and providing Agent Coulson with the [[Destroyer (Thor)#Film|Destroyer gun]] to take out enemy soldiers, before they confront [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]] and [[Deathlok]]. In the aftermath, Coulson vaporizes Garrett and criticizes Fury for using GH325 to revive him. Fury responds that he values Coulson as much as any Avenger, because he represents the heart and moral center of S.H.I.E.L.D., and declares Coulson the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D., tasking him with rebuilding the organization from scratch, and equips him with a 'toolbox' containing useful data. Under cover of his apparent death, Fury heads to Eastern Europe to hunt down the remaining Hydra cells. After Tony Stark creates the program Ultron, which turns out to be villainous and forces the Avengers into hiding, Fury shows up on Clint Barton's farm to help and motivate the Avengers formulate a plan to stop Ultron from destroying humanity. He and other former agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. use a helicarrier to help the Avengers in the final battle against Ultron, and later helps the Avengers get their new headquarters up and running.

===Aftermath of the Infinity War===
After Thanos succeeds in obtaining the Infinity Stones and snaps to destroy half of life in the universe, Fury and Maria Hill are seen discussing the Avengers' battle against [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]'s forces in [[Wakanda]], and Tony Stark's current status, when both begin to disintegrate. Before fading away completely, Fury uses the modified pager previously given to him to send a distress call to [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]]. When the Avengers reassemble the Infinity Stones and undo the snap five years later, Fury is brought back, and attends the funeral of Tony Stark, who had sacrificed himself to save the universe.

Eight months later, Fury and Hill investigate an unnatural storm in Mexico, and later encounter the Earth [[Elementals (Marvel Comics)|Elemental]]. A super-powered man, [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]], arrives to fight the creature. Fury later meets with Peter Parker and gives him Tony Stark's glasses, which were meant for Stark's successor. The glasses are equipped with the [[artificial intelligence]] E.D.I.T.H., which has access to all databases of [[Stark Industries]], and commands a large [[Space weapon|orbital weapons supply]]. Parker rejects Fury's call to arms, opting to rejoin his class, but Fury covertly redirects the school trip's itinerary to [[Prague]], where the Fire Elemental is projected to strike. Ultimately, the Elementals are revealed to be illusions created by Beck, who is defeated, with Maria Hill destroying a drone sent to kill Fury during the climactic battle. In a post-credits scene, the Skrulls [[Talos (comics)|Talos]] and Soren are revealed to have been masquerading as Fury and Hill the whole time, as directed by the real Fury, who is relaxing in a Skrull spaceship.

==Reception==

In a generally positive review of ''The Avengers'', [[Associated Press]] reviewer [[Christy Lemire]] wrote that "[t]he no-nonsense Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D.—which had been entrusted with the safety of [the Tesseract]—springs into action to reacquire it by assembling a dream team of superheroes and other sundry bad-asses with specialized skills".<ref name="associatedpress">{{cite news |last=Lemire |first=Christy |author-link=Christy Lemire |date=April 24, 2012 |url=http://www.dailytribune.com/article/20120424/ENTERTAINMENT05/120429812/review-have-a-blast-with-avengers--&pager=full_story |title=Review: Have a blast with 'Avengers{{'-}} |agency=Associated Press |work=The Daily Tribune |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818074628/https://www.dailytribune.com/article/20120424/entertainment05/120429812/review-have-a-blast-with-avengers--%26pager%3Dfull_story/ |archive-date=August 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Reviewing ''The Winter Soldier'', [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that "from a dramatic point of view, the greatest interest lies with Jackson and Redford, two great veterans whose presence lends weight to the fantastical proceedings and whose characters take some interesting twists and turns before it's all over".<ref name="McCarthy-THR">{{cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=March 20, 2014 |title=Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/captain-america-winter-soldier/review/689435 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=March 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321145154/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/captain-america-winter-soldier/review/689435 |archive-date=March 21, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Fury was noted to have been "largely missing in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe", with both Jackson and fans of the franchise being "bummed that Fury was left out of ''Civil War'' and ''Black Panther''", though he later had a substantial role in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464339/nick-furys-infinity-war-scene-may-have-teased-the-return-of-another-marvel-character|title=Nick Fury's Infinity War Scene May Have Teased The Return Of Another Marvel Character|first=Corey|last=Chichizola|publisher=CinemaBlend|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=June 9, 2020|archive-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609122708/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464339/nick-furys-infinity-war-scene-may-have-teased-the-return-of-another-marvel-character|url-status=live}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Owen Gleiberman]] said of the latter film that the "digitally de-aged Samuel L.
