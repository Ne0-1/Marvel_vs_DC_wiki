Jackson]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Nick Fury|of the same name]]. Fury is depicted as the Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who creates and enacts the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Initiative]] after discovering other threats to the Earth.

{{As of|2021}}, Fury has appeared in eleven MCU films, beginning with ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).

He will appear in the upcoming film ''[[The Marvels]]'' (2023) and will star in the miniseries ''[[Secret Invasion (TV series)|Secret Invasion]]''.

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
[[File:Samuel L. Jackson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Jackson at the 2018 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]
Fury originally appeared in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]] and writer [[Stan Lee]], Fury [[first appeared]] in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' No. 1 (May 1963), a [[World War II]] [[war comics|combat series]] that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite [[U.S. Army]] unit. In 1998, [[David Hasselhoff]] portrayed Fury in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television movie ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The MCU version of Nick Fury jettisoned a number of details from the original comic book version. Aside from the original character having been white (a detail already changed in the comics before the MCU came to fruition), the original comic book Nick Fury was a World War II veteran who knew [[Captain America]] and led the [[Howling Commandos]], and lost sight in his left eye during a grenade attack in that war. In both the original comic book and the Ultimate Marvel versions, Fury was able to remain active many decades after the war because he aged unnaturally slowly due to regular doses of an Infinity Formula.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.looper.com/144989/the-untold-truth-of-nick-fury/|title=The untold truth of Nick Fury|first=Mike|last=Floorwalker|publisher=Looper|date=February 7, 2019|access-date=June 12, 2020|archive-date=June 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612002555/https://www.looper.com/144989/the-untold-truth-of-nick-fury/|url-status=live}}</ref> A popular character over a number of decades, in 2011, Fury was ranked 33rd in [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes",<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/33|title= Nick Fury – #33 Top Comic Book Heroes|publisher= IGN|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130406152017/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/33|archive-date= April 6, 2013|url-status= live|access-date= May 29, 2012}}</ref> and 32nd in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |date= April 30, 2012|title= The Top 50 Avengers |url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/32|publisher= IGN|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117074539/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/32|archive-date= November 17, 2015|url-status= live |access-date= July 28, 2015}}</ref> He has sometimes been considered an antihero.{{cn|date=September 2022}}

At the end, he hires him as a consultant for the Initiative.

In the post-credits scene for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), Fury enlists Dr. [[Erik Selvig]]’s help to study the Tesseract. In ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), Fury greets [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]]: "You've been asleep, Cap, for almost seventy years."

Noting that he does more in ''The Avengers'' than in any of the previous films, Jackson said, "You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me". About the role, Jackson said, "It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem." Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in ''Jackie Brown'', calling him "a nice guy to hang out with.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early developments===
{{further|Captain Marvel (film)}}

Nicholas Joseph Fury was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] in 1950. He joined the [[United States Army]] after graduating from high school, eventually becoming a [[Colonel]]. He later left the army to join the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], where he served as a spy during the [[Cold War]]. He was eventually recruited to the covert espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D]].

In 1995, [[Kree (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kree]] Empire [[Starforce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vers]] crash-lands in [[Los Angeles]], drawing S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Fury and [[Phil Coulson]] to investigate. In an ensuing [[Skrulls (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skrull]] attack, Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Skrull commander [[Talos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Talos]], disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her. Vers, escaping capture by the Skrull, uses memories they have extracted to bring Fury to the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Project Pegasus|Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was Carol Danvers, a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental jet engine designed by Dr. [[Mar-Vell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as a woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a quadjet with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Later, Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Space Stone|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. Danvers is captured by Starforce, and in the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Species of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Flerken|Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury's face, blinding his left eye. Danvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], "Avenger".

Later, Fury became the Deputy Chief of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Bogotá]] station, where he "proved his leadership mettle" by engineering the rescue of hostages captured by Colombian rebels at the country's embassy, including the daughter of then-S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Alexander Pierce (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alexander Pierce]], prompting Pierce to make him director of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Pierce joined the [[World Security Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456051/captain-marvel-what-we-know-so-far-about-nick-furys-past|title=Captain Marvel: What We Know So Far About Nick Fury's Past|date=August 20, 2018|publisher=CinemaBlend|access-date=September 20, 2019|archive-date=September 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920144530/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456051/captain-marvel-what-we-know-so-far-about-nick-furys-past|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Assembling the Avengers===
{{further|Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man 2|Thor (film)|Captain America: The First Avenger|The Avengers (2012 film)|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)}}

In 2010, Fury visits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] in his Malibu home and recruits him into the "Avengers Initiative".

Six months later in 2011, Fury approaches Stark at [[Randy's Donuts]], revealing that Stark's recently acquired new assistant "Natalie Rushman" is S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that his father [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard]] was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father Anton and Howard invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Howard had him deported. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material, enabling Stark to synthesize a new element for his arc reactor that ends his palladium dependency. Later, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant.

Shortly before the Battle of New York in 2012, Fury enlists Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] to study the Tesseract. In New York City, he oversees the reintroduction of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] into society. Fury is present with his colleague and friend [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] at the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility when [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives to steal the Tesseract and take control of Agent [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] and Selvig. Fury calls in Romanoff, Stark, Rogers, and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to fight Loki. Later, Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers, now including [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], to work as a team, leading to their stand against Loki and the invading [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] army in New York City. When the World Security Council authorizes the nuclear bombing of the city to defeat the invasion, Fury uses a rocket launcher to take out one of the two jets launching for that mission, but is too late to stop the second, which fires a missile that is intercepted by Stark.

After Loki's defeat, Fury authorizes the use of alien technology to resurrect Coulson from death and, in response to the invasion, convinces the Council that the world needs "a quantum surge in threat analysis".

===Fighting Hydra and Ultron===
{{further|Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}

In 2014, Fury trains Rogers to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and proposes Project Insight: three S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarriers armed with spy satellite guided guns, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. The Helicarriers are capable of continuous suborbital flight, due to new Repulsor engines proposed by Stark, their guns can kill 1,000 targets per minute, and the satellites, launched from the ''Lemurian Star'', a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel, can read a target's DNA anywhere in the world. However, when the project is a few weeks away from completion, Fury grows suspicious about Insight. He hires an Algerian mercenary, [[Georges Batroc (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Georges Batroc]], to hijack the ''Star'' as cover to allow Romanoff onto the ship with Rogers to retrieve data regarding Insight. Though Romanoff is successful, Fury is unable to decrypt the data, increasing his suspicions and forcing him to convince Pierce to delay the project. Shortly afterwards, an attempt is made on Fury's life by [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]], which is revealed to have taken over S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury is apparently killed by their most dangerous assassin, the Winter Soldier, but he is revealed to have faked his death using Tetrodotoxin B, a drug designed by Banner that was capable of slowing down the heart to 1 beat per minute. Rogers, [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], and Romanoff are taken by Hill to see him alive and in a hidden bunker. After it is revealed that Pierce is working for Hydra, Fury reappears to override Hydra's control of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s computer systems, forcing Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Fury reveals that although Pierce had deleted Fury's retinal scan from the system, Fury had a backup scan of his destroyed other eye. He then tells Rogers, Wilson, and Romanoff that he is to go into hiding in Europe to hunt down more Hydra cells.

Once Hydra's plan to control the world is foiled, Fury appears to assist S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the aftermath of those events, rescuing agents [[Leo Fitz]] and [[Jemma Simmons]] from drowning in the ocean and providing Agent Coulson with the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer gun]] to take out enemy soldiers, before they confront [[John Garrett (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|John Garrett]] and [[Mike Peterson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Deathlok]]. In the aftermath, Coulson vaporizes Garrett and criticizes Fury for using GH325 to revive him. Fury responds that he values Coulson as much as any Avenger, because he represents the heart and moral center of S.H.I.E.L.D., and declares Coulson the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D., tasking him with rebuilding the organization from scratch, and equips him with a 'toolbox' containing useful data.

In 2015, Fury arrives at Barton's home to help and motivate Stark, Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, and Barton to formulate a plan to stop [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]. He, Hill, and other former agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] use the original helicarrier to help the Avengers in [[Sokovia]] during the final battle against Ultron. Afterwards, he oversees the Avengers transition into the new [[Avengers Compound]].

Coulson subsequently reveals to Gonzalez and his board that he and Fury had discovered that the original helicarrier survived HYDRA's attack and repaired it as a failsafe in case of an emergency.

===Aftermath of the Infinity War===
{{further|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame|Spider-Man: Far From Home}}

In 2018, Fury and Hill are travelling in [[Atlanta]] discussing the Avengers' whereabouts when Hill suddenly disintegrates due to [[the Blip]], prompting Fury to use his pager to summon Danvers, before he too disintegrates.

In 2023, Fury is restored to life and attends Stark's funeral, reuniting with Danvers. Some time later, he appoints Talos and [[Soren (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Soren]] to impersonate him and Hill while he takes a vacation in space on a Skrull ship.

In 2024, Fury is informed by Talos via phone call that [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] received [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Tony Stark's glasses|Tony Stark's glasses]]. Talos then asked Fury to come back to Earth, as people were beginning to ask what happened to the Avengers. Still in space, Fury disconnects the call.

{{further|What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?|What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?}}
In an alternate 2010, Fury witnesses Stark, Barton, Thor, and Romanoff's deaths during his Avengers Initiative recruitment campaign. He eventually deduces that their murders were instigated by [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] and temporarily allies with Loki to confront him in [[San Francisco]]. After Pym is defeated, Loki quickly subjugates the planet and becomes its ruler, prompting Fury to summon Danvers and awaken Rogers.

Sometime later, Fury leads a resistance movement against Loki and his army with a new Avengers team composed of Rogers and Danvers. As they fight on the Helicarrier, Fury watches as a Romanoff from another universe appears and subdues Loki with his Scepter. Despite acknowledging that she is not the Romanoff he knows, Fury praises her for sharing the same spirit and recruits her into the Avengers.

===Stopping Thor's party===
{{Further|What If... Thor Were an Only Child?}}
In an alternate timeline, Fury goes to [[Las Vegas]] to confront Thor regarding his out-of-control intergalactic party, but is accidentally knocked out by [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]] during one of his [[Cannonball (diving)|cannonball]]s and falls into a [[coma]], forcing Maria Hill to take over as acting director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Fury was noted to have been "largely missing in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe", with both Jackson and fans of the franchise being "bummed that Fury was left out of ''Civil War'' and ''Black Panther''", though he later had a substantial role in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464339/nick-furys-infinity-war-scene-may-have-teased-the-return-of-another-marvel-character|title=Nick Fury's Infinity War Scene May Have Teased The Return Of Another Marvel Character|first=Corey|last=Chichizola|publisher=CinemaBlend|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=June 9, 2020|archive-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609122708/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464339/nick-furys-infinity-war-scene-may-have-teased-the-return-of-another-marvel-character|url-status=live}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Owen Gleiberman]] said of the latter film that the "digitally de-aged Samuel L. Jackson" in ''Captain Marvel'' was "done a surprising favor by the visual trickery. He seems different than usual—lighter and perkier."<ref name="VarietyReview">{{Cite web|title=Film Review: Brie Larson in 'Captain Marvel'|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson-1203154542/|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|author-link=Owen Gleiberman|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 5, 2019|access-date=March 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190305161152/https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson-1203154542/|archive-date=March 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jackson himself is fond of playing the character. After receiving an 
[[Academy Honorary Award|honorary Oscar]] in 2021, he remarked in an interview with the [[Los Angeles Times]] that he prefers the role over ones in what he described as “[[Oscar bait|statue chasing movies]].” <ref>{{cite web |last1=Whipp |first1=Glenn |title=Samuel L.
