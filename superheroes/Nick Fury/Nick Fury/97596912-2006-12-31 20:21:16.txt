Colonel '''Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[World War II]] army hero and present-day [[espionage fiction|superspy]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]

Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Fury [[first appeared]] in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #1 (May 1963), a combat series that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite [[U.S. Army]] unit. 

The modern-day Fury, initially a [[CIA]] agent, debuted a few months later in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' Vol. 1, #21 (Dec. 1963). Then, beginning with ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #135 (Aug. 1965), the character was completely transformed into a [[James Bond]]-like spy and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Although artistically influential, the series ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' did not outlast the 1960s and subsequent Fury series have been sporadic. The character makes frequent appearances in Marvel [[comic book]]s as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or the [[United Nations]] and various [[superhero]]es.

==Publication history==
===Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos===
{{main|Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos}}
Fury initially appeared in the World War II [[war novel|combat]] series ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'', as the cigar-chomping [[noncommissioned officer|NCO]] who led a racially and ethnically integrated elite unit. The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 - Dec. 1981), though only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974). Following several issues by creators Lee and Kirby, [[penciler]] [[Dick Ayers]] began his long stint on what would be his signature series; [[John Severin]] later joined as inker, forming a long-running, critically acclaimed team. [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Lee as writer, following by [[Gary Friedrich]], for whom this also became a signature series.

The Howling Commandos encountered [[Office of Strategic Services]] agent Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky]] in #13 (Dec. 1964).

===''Strange Tales'' and solo series===
In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' Vol. 1, #135 (Aug. 1965), Fury, now a colonel, became a [[James Bond]]-esque [[Cold War]] spy, with Marvel introducing the covert organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division) and its nemesis [[HYDRA]]. (The name, for unexplained reasons, is not an [[acronym]] but capitalized regardless, according to Marvel.)
[[Image:strange135.jpg|left|190px|''Strange Tales'' #135 (Aug. 1965). Cover art by Jack Kirby and [[Frank Giacoia]].|thumb|200px]]
The 12-page feature was initially by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the '''Helicarrier''' — an airborne [[aircraft carrier]] — as well as human-replicant '''LMDs ([[Life Model Decoys]])''', and even [[automobile]] [[airbags]]. Writer-penciler-[[colorist]] [[Jim Steranko]] began on the feature in ''Strange Tales'' #151 (initially over Kirby layouts), and quickly became one of the comics' most acclaimed and influential artists. In some of the creative zeniths of the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]], Streranko established the feature as one of comics most groundbreaking, innovative and acclaimed.<ref>[[Ron Goulart]], in ''Comix: A History of Comic Books in America'' (Bonanza Books, New York, 1971; Library of Congres Catalog Card Number 75-169-104), wrote, "[E]ven the dullest of readers could sense that somethng new was happening. ... Which each passing issue Steranko's efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to [[photocollage]]s of drawings [that] ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages ... became incredible production numbers similar in design to the [[San Francisco]] [[rock concert]] [[poster]] of the period". [[Larry Hama]] in his introduction to the [[trade paperback]] collection ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?'' (Marvel Enterprises, 2001; ISBN 0-7851-0766-5), said Steranko "combined the figurative  dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts. The [[graphic design|graphic influences]] of [[Peter Max]], Op Art and [[Andy Warhol]] were embedded into the design of the pages — and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension". The series won 1967 and 1968 [[Alley Award]]s, and was inducted in the latter year to the awards' Hall of Fame. Steranko himself was inducted into the [[Eisner Award#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 2006.</ref> He introduced  or popularized in comics such art movements of the day as [[psychedelia]] and [[op art]]; built on Kirby's longstanding work in [[photomontage]]; and created comics' first four-page spread — again inspired by Kirby, who in the [[Golden Age of comic books]] had pioneered the first full-page and double-page spreads. All the while, he spun plots of intense intrigue, barely hidden sensuality, and hi-fi hipness — and supplying  his own version of [[Bond girls]], pushing what was allowable under the [[Comics Code]] at the time.  

The feature ran through #168 (sharing the split book with the occult feature "[[Doctor Strange]]" each issue), after which it was spun off onto its own series of the same title, premiering with a June 1968 cover date. Four of its first five issues were written and pencilled by Steranko. Upon his departure, several other creators, both veterans and newcomers, worked on the increasingly directionless series; it was canceled with issue #15 (Nov. 1969). Three reprint issues followed from November 1970 to March 1971.

Fury continued to make appearances in the other Marvel books, from ''Fantastic Four'' to ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. In 1972, ''Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos'' celebrated its 100th issue with a present-day reunion of the squad, sponsored by [[Stan Lee]] and the creative team behind the title. (Lee, like other comics professionals, has made occasional cameos, in a tradition going back to the Golden Age.) In 1988, Marvel produced the six-issue ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' miniseries, following it up with a second ''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' series. In 1991, Marvel changed S.H.I.E.L.D. to stand for "Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage and Logistics Directorate". A pivotal event of the second series was "the Deltite Affair", in which S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with [[Life Model Decoy]] androids. The second series lasted 47 issues (Sept. 1989 - May 1993). The series also resurrected (again) the presumed-dead Baron von Strucker.

In 1994, the ''Fury'' one-shot retconned the events of ''Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and the second ''Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' series, recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from von Strucker's resurrection plans. The following year, Howard Chaykin wrote the four-issue limited series ''Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (April-July 1995).

In the one-shot ''Over the Edge: Omega'' (Oct. 1995), [[the Punisher]] is captured and sent to a maximum-security facility with a S.H.I.E.L.D. escort. During a hypnosis session with [[Doc Samson]], a character named Spook interrupts and has the Punisher conditioned to believe Fury was responsible for the murder of the Punisher's family. An escaped Punisher eventually killed Fury, who was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

The ''Fury/Agent 13'' two-issue limited series (June-July 1998) then [[retcon]]ned that the Nick Fury the Punisher "killed" was a highly-advanced Life Model Decoy and that Fury was never dead.
Fury has since made a number of appearances in such Marvel series as ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[Deathlok]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', and books in the "[[Marvel Knights]]" imprint.

In the 2004-5 ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries, Fury recruited several heroes in an illegal attempt to overthrow the government of [[Latveria]]. Fury afterward went underground, and subsequent S.H.I.E.L.D. director Maria Hill has used Life Model Decoys to impersonate him on several occasions.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and wartime===
[[Image:Nickfuryshield.jpg|right|200px|2001 trade-paperback collection, with repurposed cover art from ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #4 (March 1968) by [[Jim Steranko]]<!--confirmed: pencils & inks both-->.|thumb]]
Nicholas Joseph Fury was the eldest of three children born to Jack Fury. His father was a [[United States]] citizen who enlisted in the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Flying Corps]] during [[World War I]]. Jack had enlisted in 1916 and was stationed in [[France under the Third Republic]]. He reportedly shot down [[Manfred von Richthofen]] early in his flying career, and was a highly decorated combat [[aviator]] by the end of the War in 1918.

Discharged after the War, Jack returned home, married an unnamed woman, and became the father of three children. Nick, probably born in the late 1910s or early 1920s, was followed by Jacob "Jake" Fury (later the [[supervillain]] [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], who co-founded the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] cartel), and their sister, Dawn.

All three children grew up in the neighbourhood known as [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]]. Nick was an amateur [[Boxing|boxer]]. With his friend Red Hargrove, he eventually left the neighborhood to pursue his dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring wing-walking act. Their death-defying stunts caught the attention of [[Lieutenant]] Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer, who enlisted them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]]. Nick and Red later joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with Fury undergoing basic training under a Sergeant Bass. Red was stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ambushed the base on [[December 7]], [[1941]], and was among the many killed in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

Sawyer, now a [[captain]], assigned Fury the command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the "Howling Commandos" and stationed in a military base in [[England]] to fight specialized missions, primarily but not exclusively in the [[European Theatre of World War II]].<!--Howlers fought in Okinawa and elsewhere; Izzy was imprisoned for several issues as a POW in Japan-->
Fury fell in love with an English [[nurse]], Pamela Hawley, who died in a bombing raid of London before he could propose to her.

===C.I.A.===
At the [[end of World War II in Europe]], Fury was severely injured by a landmine in [[France]], and was found and healed by a Berthold Sternberg, who used him as a test subject for his '''Infinity Formula'''. After making a full recovery, Fury began working for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), precursor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Six months into his service, he learned the extent of Sternberg's life-saving operation: The Infinity Formula retarded his aging, and if he did not receive annual doses, he would age rapidly and die. The doctor began a 30-year period of extorting large sums of money from Fury in exchange for the injections. These events, culminating in the end of said extortion, were detailed in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #31 (Dec. 1976): "Assignment: The Infinity Formula," by writer [[Jim Starlin]] and artist [[Howard Chaykin]].
[[Image: StrangeTales168-NickFury.jpg|left|thumb|A rare quiet moment for Nick Fury: Splash panel, ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #168 (May 1968). Art by Steranko and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
Fury segued into the CIA as an espionage agent, gathering information in [[Korea]], where he earned a battlefield promotion to [[colonel]]. Much later, the CIA used him as a liaison to various super-powered groups that had begun appearing, <!--deleted "in the 1960s" due to Marvel's "elastic chronology" that puts the early-'60s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories--> including the [[Fantastic Four]], whom CIA agent Fury first encountered in ''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1, #21 (Dec. 1963). Despite Marvel's "elastic chronology", which puts the early-'60s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories, Marvel has never retconned an explanation for that chronological discrepancy, as the company has for many others.

During his time with the CIA, Fury began wearing his trademark [[eyepatch]]. An issue of ''Sgt. Fury'' had revealed that he had taken shrapnel to one eye during the war, which caused him to slowly lose sight in it over the course of years.

=== S.H.I.E.L.D.===
Recruited by [[Tony Stark]], Fury became the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. Initially, his organization's primary nemesis was the international terrorist organization HYDRA, created by Fury's worst enemy of the Second World War, Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker]] (after [[retcon|retconning]] of the original continuity). Under Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. grew into one of the world's most powerful organizations, reaching covertly into national governments, and forming strategic alliances with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and other [[superhero]] groups, while always maintaining independence and deniability. S.H.I.E.L.D. occasionally recruited non-superpowered costumed adventurers such as the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] into its ranks.

In the 2005 "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]" crossover, Nick Fury launched a covert assault on the leadership of [[Latveria]], who were plotting a massive attack on America.  One year after the assault, the Latverian forces launched a counter-attack, which resulted in [[Luke Cage]] being hospitalized, Fury's friendship with Captain America becoming strained, and Fury being removed as S.H.I.E.L.D. commander and forced into hiding, with numerous international warrants out for his arrest. His successor as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. is [[Maria Hill]], though a Life Model Decoy of Fury, often under Hill's control, is used in certain circles.

The first story arc in the series ''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' (2005- &nbsp; ), "Breakout", revealed an additional ranking, "Champion Status", that effectively removes them from the traditional S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy and, as [[Captain America]] comments, gives status-holder such as himself the right to assemble any team to carry out any mission he believes necessary. In addition, confusingly, ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2 (Aug. 2006) established Nick Fury as the only "33rd-degree" S.H.I.E.L.D officer, meaning he is the only member of S.H.I.E.L.D, present or past,  to know the full existence of 28 emergency, covert bases scattered across the globe. In that issue, he gave at least one of these bases to Captain America for the use of the anti-[[Superhero Registration Act]] resistance.

==Other versions of Nick Fury==
Different versions of Nick Fury, not part of the regular [[Marvel Universe]], have appeared from time to time, including:
*The ''Fury'' miniseries by [[Garth Ennis]]. under the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint imagined a world where Fury was a burned-out Cold War veteran unable to cope with the modern world.  This version, created by [[Garth Ennis]], continues to appear in Ennis' ''[[Punisher]]'' series. Writer-editor Stan Lee, co-creator Nick Fury, was critical of the extreme violence and gore of this new series: "I don't know why they're doing that. I don't think that I would do those kinds of stories." <ref>James Adams, "Code Red in the new comicdom", The Globe and Mail, May 2, 2002, p. R9</ref> 
*''Fury: Peacemaker'', a six-part miniseries written by Ennis, was published in 2006 under the Marvel Knights imprint. It portrayed a young Sergeant Fury during World War II, who rendezvous with members of the newly formed [[Special Air Services|British SAS]] and joins them in a mission to assassinate an important German general. 
*In the 1996 Marvel/DC [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam]] comic ''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Nick Fury appeared as a retired army colonel alongside [[Sgt. Rock (comics)|General Frank Rock]].

*In Marvel comics's Earth X continuity, Nick Fury is dead. However several LMDs ([[Life Model Decoy]]) exist and seek to fight Cold War-era "no-good pinko commies".
*In ''[[Avataars: Covenant of the Shield]]'', a miniseries set in a [[sword and sorcery]] world, Fury's counterpart is Regent Nicholas, who watches over the throne of Avalon "with his elite guard as its shield".

==Parodies and references==
* It has often been voiced how much [[Big Boss]] resembles Nick Fury, from his superior soldier and tactical espionage abilities down to his signature eye patch. 
* The three-page opening sequence of ''Captain America'' (2004 series) #23 (Dec. 2006) is a panel-by-panel homage to writer-artist [[Jim Steranko]]'s influential ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1 (June 1968).
* [[The Simpsons]] paid homage to parts of that same sequence, as well as to the [[splash page]] of "If Death Be my Destiny" in ''Strange Tales'' #166 (March 1968), in the [[Krusty the Klown]] parody "Krusty, Agent Of K.L.O.W.N." in ''[[Simpsons Comics]]'' #3 (March 1994). Fury was again spoofed along with Dum-Dum Dugan in [[Simpsons Comics]] #118.
*A scene in [[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]] #11 shows a character with an eyepatch and a cigar being shot in the head by a villain in a flashback introducing [[John Stone (comics)|John Stone]], Agent of S.T.O.R.M. (himself a pastiche of Nick Fury and James Bond).
*The [[Nextwave]] team, in the comic of the same name, often have to contend with [[Dirk Anger]], head of H.A.T.E, parodies of Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.
* The [[Marvel 2099]] comic ''[[X-Nation 2099]]'' featured the ''Sisters of the Howling Commandments'', a militaristic order of nuns, including a Sister Nicholas.
*''[[The Tick]]'' [[animated TV series]] has included secret agent Jim Rage, Agent of SHAVE. Unlike Nick Fury, there's nothing wrong with his eye; he wears the patch just to look cool.
*In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode "[[Con Heir]]", C.I.A. agent Stan's father resembles Fury.
*The satirical magazine ''[[National Lampoon]]'' parodied Nick Fury in "Nick Penis and the Brassball Brigade".
*In the animated TV series ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', Brock Samson's mentor is a cross between Nick Fury and Raoul Duke, the [[Hunter Thompson]]-manque lead character of the film ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998).<!--Note: Fury is easy to spot, with the eye patch, cigar, etc. What confirms that Duke homage?-->{{fact}}
*In the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode [[As You Were (Buffy episode)|As You Were]], [[Xander Harris]] sarcastically refers to commando Riley Finn and his new wife as "Nick and Nora Fury", a reference to both the Marvel character and to the stars of the [[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]] film series, detectives [[Nick and Nora Charles]].
