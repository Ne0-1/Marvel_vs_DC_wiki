'''[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[World War II]] army hero and present-day [[spy fiction|super-spy]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]].

Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Fury [[first appeared]] in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #1 (May 1963), a combat series that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite [[U.S. Army]] unit. 

The modern-day Fury, initially a [[CIA]] agent, debuted a few months later in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #21 (Dec. 1963). In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' vol. 1, #135 (Aug. 1965) the character was transformed into a [[James Bond]]-like spy and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The character makes frequent appearances in Marvel [[comic book]]s as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or the [[United Nations]] and various [[superhero]]es.  It is eventually revealed that Fury takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that halted his aging and allows him to be active despite being chronologically nearly a century old. 

==Publication history==
===Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos===
{{main|Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos}}
Fury initially appeared in the World War II [[war novel|combat]] series ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'', as the cigar-chomping [[noncommissioned officer|NCO]] who led a racially and ethnically integrated elite unit. The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 - Dec. 1981), though only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974). Following several issues by creators Lee and Kirby, [[penciller]] [[Dick Ayers]] began his long stint on what would be his signature series; [[John Severin]] later joined as inker, forming a long-running, critically acclaimed team. [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Lee as writer, following by [[Gary Friedrich]], for whom this also became a signature series.

The Howling Commandos encountered [[Office of Strategic Services]] agent Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky]] in #13 (Dec. 1964).

===''Strange Tales'' and solo series===
In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' vol. 1, #135 (Aug. 1965), Fury, now a colonel, became a [[James Bond]]-esque [[Cold War]] spy, with Marvel introducing the covert organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division) and its nemesis [[HYDRA]]. (The name, for unexplained reasons, is not an [[acronym]] but capitalized regardless, according to Marvel.)
[[Image:strange135.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Strange Tales'' #135 (Aug. 1965). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Frank Giacoia]].]]
The 12-page feature was initially by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the '''[[Helicarrier]]''' — an airborne [[aircraft carrier]] — as well as human-replicant '''LMDs ([[Life Model Decoy]]s)''', and even [[automobile]] [[airbags]]. Writer-penciler-[[colorist]] [[Jim Steranko]] began on the feature in ''Strange Tales'' #151 (initially over Kirby layouts), and quickly became one of the comics' most acclaimed and influential artists. In some of the creative zeniths of the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]], Streranko established the feature as one of comics most groundbreaking, innovative and acclaimed.<ref>[[Ron Goulart]], in ''Comix: A History of Comic Books in America'' (Bonanza Books, New York, 1971; Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 75-169-104), wrote, "[E]ven the dullest of readers could sense that something new was happening. ... Which each passing issue Steranko's efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to [[photocollage]]s of drawings [that] ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages ... became incredible production numbers similar in design to the [[San Francisco]] [[rock concert]] [[poster]] of the period". [[Larry Hama]] in his introduction to the [[trade paperback]] collection ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?'' (Marvel Enterprises, 2001; ISBN 0-7851-0766-5), said Steranko "combined the figurative  dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts. The [[graphic design|graphic influences]] of [[Peter Max]], Op Art and [[Andy Warhol]] were embedded into the design of the pages — and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension". The series won 1967 and 1968 [[Alley Award]]s, and was inducted in the latter year to the awards' Hall of Fame. Steranko himself was inducted into the [[Eisner Award#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 2006.</ref> He introduced  or popularized in comics such art movements of the day as [[psychedelia]] and [[op art]]; built on Kirby's longstanding work in [[photomontage]]; and created comics' first four-page spread — again inspired{{Fact|date=April 2007}} by Kirby, who in the 1930s-1940s period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]] had pioneered the first full-page and double-page spreads. All the while, he spun plots of intense intrigue, barely hidden sensuality, and hi-fi hipness — and supplying  his own version of [[Bond girls]], pushing what was allowable under the [[Comics Code]] at the time. 

The 12-page feature ran through ''Strange Tales'' #168 (sharing that "split book" with the occult feature "[[Doctor Strange]]" each issue), after which it was spun off onto its own series of the same title, running 15 issues (June 1968 - Nov. 1969), followed by three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (Nov. 1970 - March 1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1-3 and #5, and drew the covers of #1-7.

Fury continued to make appearances in the other Marvel books, from ''Fantastic Four'' to ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. In 1972, ''Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos'' celebrated its 100th issue with a present-day reunion of the squad, sponsored by [[Stan Lee]] and the creative team behind the title. (Lee, like other comics professionals, has made occasional cameos, in a tradition going back to the 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books]]).

New S.H.I.E.L.D. stories would not appear for nearly two decades after the first solo title. A six-issue [[miniseries]], ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (June-Nov. 1988) was followed by ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' <!--official title per postal indicia, per GCD--> vol. 2. This second series lasted 47 issues (Sept. 1989 - May 1993); its pivotal story arc was "the Deltite Affair", in which many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with [[Life Model Decoy]] androids in a takeover attempt. 

A year after that series ended, the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Fury'' (May 1994) [[retconned]] the events of those previous two series, recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of HYDRA head von Strucker. The following year, writer [[Howard Chaykin]] and penciler [[Corky Lehmkuhl]] produced the four-issue miniseries ''Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (April-July 1995). Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury's solo adventures, such as the [[graphic novel]]s and one-shots ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] - Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection'' (1989), ''Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising'' (Oct. 1994), ''Fury/[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]: Death Duty'' and ''[[Captain America]]/Nick Fury: Blood Truce'' (both Feb. 1995), and ''Captain America/Nick Fury: The Otherworld War'' (Oct. 2001). He also starred in the 2004-2005 ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life and wartime===
Nicholas Joseph Fury was the eldest of three children born to Jack Fury in [[New York City]]. His father was a [[United States]] citizen who enlisted in the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Flying Corps]] during [[World War I]]. Jack had enlisted in 1916 and was stationed in [[France]]. He reportedly shot down [[Manfred von Richthofen]] early in his flying career, and was a highly decorated combat [[aviator]] by the end of the War in 1918.

Discharged after the War, Jack returned home, married an unnamed woman, and became the father of three children. Nick, probably born in the late 1910s or early 1920s, was followed by Jacob "Jake" Fury (later the [[supervillain]] [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], who co-founded the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] cartel), and their sister, Dawn.

All three children grew up in the neighborhood known as [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]]. Nick was an amateur [[Boxing|boxer]]. With his friend Red Hargrove, he eventually left the neighborhood to pursue his dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring wing-walking act. Their death-defying stunts caught the attention of [[Lieutenant]] [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer]], who enlisted them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]]. Nick and Red later joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with Fury undergoing basic training under a Sergeant Bass. Red was stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ambushed the base on [[December 7]], [[1941]], and was among the many killed in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

Sawyer, now a [[captain]], assigned Fury the command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the "Howling Commandos" and stationed in a military base in [[England]] to fight specialized missions, primarily but not exclusively in the [[European Theatre of World War II]].<!--Howlers fought in Okinawa and elsewhere; Izzy was imprisoned for several issues as a POW in Japan-->
Fury fell in love with an English [[nurse]], Pamela Hawley, who died in a bombing raid on London before he could propose to her.

===C.I.A.===
At the [[end of World War II in Europe]], Fury was severely injured by a landmine in [[France]], and was found and healed by a Berthold Sternberg, who used him as a test subject for his '''Infinity Formula'''. After making a full recovery, Fury began working for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), precursor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Six months into his service, he learned the extent of Sternberg's life-saving operation: The Infinity Formula retarded his aging, and if he did not receive annual doses, he would age rapidly and die. The doctor began a 30-year period of extorting large sums of money from Fury in exchange for the injections. These events, culminating in the end of said extortion, were detailed in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #31 (Dec. 1976): "Assignment: The Infinity Formula," by writer [[Jim Starlin]] and artist [[Howard Chaykin]].
[[Image:StrangeTales168-NickFury.jpg|left|thumb|A rare quiet moment for Nick Fury: Splash panel, ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #168 (May 1968). Art by Steranko and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
Fury segued into the CIA as an espionage agent, gathering information in [[Korea]], where he earned a battlefield promotion to [[colonel]]. During this time, he recommended the recruitment of married agents [[Richard and Mary Parker]], who would go on to become the parents of Fury's occasional super-hero ally [[Spider-Man]]. Much later, the CIA used him as a liaison to various super-powered groups that had begun appearing, <!--deleted "in the 1960s" due to Marvel's "elastic chronology" that puts the early-'60s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories--> including the [[Fantastic Four]], whom CIA agent Fury first encountered in ''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1, #21 (Dec. 1963). Despite Marvel's "elastic chronology", which puts the early-'60s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories, Marvel has never retconned an explanation for that chronological discrepancy, as the company has for many others.

During his time with the CIA, Fury began wearing his trademark [[eyepatch]]. An issue of ''Sgt. Fury'' had revealed that he had taken shrapnel to one eye during the war, which caused him to slowly lose sight in it over the course of years.

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
Recruited by [[Tony Stark]], Fury became the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. Initially, his organization's primary nemesis was the international terrorist organization HYDRA, created by Fury's worst enemy of the Second World War, Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker]] (after [[retcon]]ning of the original continuity). Under Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. grew into one of the world's most powerful organizations, reaching covertly into national governments, and forming strategic alliances with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and other [[superhero]] groups, while always maintaining independence and deniability. Fury soon became the superhero community's main contact when government-related information was required in order to deal with a crisis.

After years at the helm, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA have both fallen under the control of a group of sentient [[Life Model Decoy]] androids known as Deltites. Betrayed, Fury goes to ground, hunted by his fellow agents, many of whom were later revealed to have already been replaced with Deltites.  Although Fury ultimately exposes and overcomes the Deltite threat, the conflict is so destructive to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s personnel and infrastructure, and leaves Fury so disillusioned, that Fury chooses to disband the agency to prevent it from again being subverted from within.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1988)</ref>

Fury rebuilds S.H.I.E.L.D. from the ground up, initially as a more streamlined agency small enough for him to personally oversee and protect from being corrupted. This new incarnation changed the acronym to stand for "Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate". 

Sometime later, Frank Castle, the [[vigilante]] known as the [[Punisher]], is captured and sent to a maximum-security facility with a S.H.I.E.L.D. escort. During a hypnosis session with [[Doc Samson]], a character named Spook interrupts and has the Punisher conditioned to believe Fury was responsible for the murder of the Punisher's family. An escaped Punisher eventually killed Fury, who was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>''Over the Edge: Omega'' (Oct. 1995)</ref> However, the Fury that the Punisher had "killed" was revealed to be a highly advanced Life Model Decoy android.<ref>''Fury/Agent 13'' #1-2 (June-July 1998).</ref>

Returned to his post as S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Fury on his own enlisted the [[superheroes]] [[Captain America]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] to launch a covert assault on the leadership of [[Latveria]], who were plotting a massive attack on the U.S. One year afterward, Latveria launched a counterattack that resulted in Fury's removal as S.H.I.E.L.D. commander, forcing him again into hiding with numerous international warrants out for his arrest. His successor as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. is first [[Maria Hill]] and then [[Tony Stark]].<ref>''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #1-5 (April 2004 - Dec. 2005)</ref> Hill, keeping Fury's disappearance from the S.H.I.E.L.D. rank and file,  has used Life Model Decoys to impersonate Fury on occasion.

Fury is the only "33rd-degree" S.H.I.E.L.D officer, meaning he is the only member of S.H.I.E.L.D, present or past, to know the full existence of 28 emergency, covert bases scattered across the globe.<ref>''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' #2 (Aug. 2006) </ref>

Writer-editor Stan Lee, a co-creator of Nick Fury, was critical of the extreme violence and gore of this new series: "I don't know why they're doing that. I don't think that I would do those kinds of stories."<ref>James Adams, "Code Red in the New Comicdom", ''The Globe and Mail'', [[May 2]] [[2002]], p. R9</ref>

===''Fury: Peacemaker''===
A six-part miniseries written by Ennis, was published in 2006 under the Marvel Knights imprint.

Earshot uses this power to trick Nick Fury into a trap, seemingly killing him.

==Parodies and homages==
* The three-page opening sequence of ''Captain America'' (2004 series) #23 (Dec. 2006) is a panel-by-panel homage to writer-artist [[Jim Steranko]]'s influential ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1 (June 1968).
* The cover of ''Wolverine'' (2003 series) #27 (April 2005) is an homage to the cover of ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #4.
* The 50/50 variant cover to Iron Man (2004 series) #15 (February 2007) by Adi Granov is also an homage to that same cover.
* Another homage of same cover was made this time using [[She-Hulk]] during the "Planet without a Hulk" storyline.
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' paid homage to parts of that same sequence, as well as to the [[splash page]] of "If Death Be my Destiny" in ''Strange Tales'' #166 (March 1968), in the [[Krusty the Klown]] parody "Krusty, Agent Of K.L.O.W.N." in ''[[Simpsons Comics]]'' #3 (March 1994). Fury was again spoofed along with Dum-Dum Dugan in [[Simpsons Comics]] #118.
* A scene in [[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]] #11 shows a character with an eyepatch and a cigar being shot in the head by a villain in a flashback introducing [[John Stone (comics)|John Stone]], Agent of S.T.O.R.M. (himself a pastiche of Nick Fury and James Bond).
* The [[Nextwave]] team, in the comic of the same name, often have to contend with [[Dirk Anger]], head of H.A.T.E, parodies of Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.
* The [[Marvel 2099]] comic ''[[X-Nation 2099]]'' featured the ''Sisters of the Howling Commandments'', a militaristic order of nuns, including a Sister Nicholas.
* In an episode of "[[Malcolm in The Middle]], Francis is practicing a singing with a group of his marine comrades, being led by a man colonel with an eye patch. After a butcherd take, he says to "Take it again, with ''Fury'' "

Fury".
* In the 1994 film ''[[True Lies]]'', spy Arnold Schwarzenegger's boss (Charlton Heston) is highly similar in appearance to Nick Fury, including the eye patch.
