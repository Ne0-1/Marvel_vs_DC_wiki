'''[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Nicholas Joseph''' "'''Nick'''" '''Fury''' is a [[fiction]]al [[World War II]] army hero and present-day [[spy fiction|super-spy]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Created by artist [[Jack Kirby]] and writer [[Stan Lee]], Fury [[first appeared]] in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #1 (May 1963), a [[World War II]] [[war comics|combat series]] that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite [[U.S. Army]] unit.

The modern-day Fury, initially a [[CIA]] agent, debuted a few months later in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #21 (Dec. 1963). In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #135 (Aug. 1965) the character was transformed into a [[James Bond]]-like spy and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The character makes frequent appearances in Marvel [[comic book]]s as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or the [[United Nations]] and various [[superhero]]es.  It is eventually revealed that Fury takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that halted his aging and allows him to be active despite being nearly a century old.

Nick Fury appears in several Marvel comic series set in [[alternate universes]], as well as multiple animated films, television shows, and video games based on the comics. The character is portrayed by [[David Hasselhoff]] in the 1998 television movie ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (film)|Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' and by [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]],'' its 2010 sequel ''[[Iron Man 2]],'' and the upcoming ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]] and [[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]],''<ref name="jackson">{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/04/19/samuel-l-jackson-talks-iron-man-2-nick-fury-captain-america-thor-and-the-avengers/|author=Sara Wayland|title=Samuel L.

==Publication history==
===Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos===
{{Main|Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos}}
Fury initially appeared in the World War II [[war novel|combat]] series ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'', as the cigar-chomping [[noncommissioned officer|NCO]] who led a racially and ethnically integrated elite unit. The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 - Dec. 1981), though only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974). Following several issues by creators Lee and Kirby, [[penciller]] [[Dick Ayers]] began his long stint on what would be his signature series; [[John Severin]] later joined as inker, forming a long-running, critically acclaimed team. [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Lee as writer, followed by [[Gary Friedrich]], for whom this also became a signature series.  Annuals featured the "Howlers" called back to fight in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]].

The Howling Commandos encountered [[Office of Strategic Services]] agent Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky]] in #13 (Dec. 1964).

===''Strange Tales'' and solo series===
In ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #135 (Aug. 1965), Fury, now a colonel, became a [[James Bond]]-esque [[Cold War]] spy, with Marvel introducing the covert organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division) and its nemesis [[HYDRA]] (the name, for unexplained reasons, is not an [[acronym]] but capitalized regardless, according to Marvel).<ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/15/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-105/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 105 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=April 15, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref>
[[Image:strange135.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''Strange Tales'' #135 (Aug. 1965). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Frank Giacoia]].]]
The 12-page feature was initially by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the '''[[Helicarrier]]''' — an airborne [[aircraft carrier]] — as well as human-replicant '''LMDs ([[Life Model Decoy]]s)''', and even [[automobile]] [[airbag]]s. Writer-penciller-[[colorist]] [[Jim Steranko]] began on the feature in ''Strange Tales'' #151 (Dec. 1966) (initially over Kirby layouts),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/20603/ ''Strange Tales'' #151] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> and quickly became one of comic books' most acclaimed and influential artists. In some of the creative zeniths of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Steranko established the feature as one of comic books' most groundbreaking, innovative, and acclaimed.<ref>[[Ron Goulart]], in ''Comix: A History of Comic Books in America'' (Bonanza Books, New York, 1971; Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 75-169-104), wrote, "[E]ven the dullest of readers could sense that something new was happening. ... Which each passing issue Steranko's efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to [[photocollage]]s of drawings [that] ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages ... became incredible production numbers similar in design to the [[San Francisco]] [[rock concert]] [[poster]] of the period". [[Larry Hama]] in his introduction to the [[trade paperback]] collection ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?'' (Marvel Enterprises, 2001; ISBN 0-7851-0766-5), said Steranko "combined the figurative dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts. The [[graphic design|graphic influences]] of [[Peter Max]], Op Art and [[Andy Warhol]] were embedded into the design of the pages — and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension". The series won 1967 and 1968 [[Alley Award]]s, and was inducted in the latter year to the awards' Hall of Fame. Steranko himself was inducted into the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 2006.</ref> He introduced  or popularized in comic books such art movements of the day as [[psychedelia]] and [[op art]]; built on Kirby's longstanding work in [[photomontage]]; and created comic books' first four-page spread — again inspired{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} by Kirby, who in the 1930s-1940s period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] had pioneered the first full-page and double-page spreads. All the while, he spun plots of intense intrigue, barely hidden sensuality, and hi-fi hipness — and supplied his own version of [[Bond girl]]s, pushing what was allowable under the [[Comics Code]] at the time.

The 12-page feature ran through ''Strange Tales'' #168 (sharing that "split book" with the occult feature "[[Doctor Strange]]" each issue), after which it was spun off onto its own series of the same title, running 15 issues (June 1968 - Nov. 1969), followed by three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (Nov. 1970 - March 1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1-3 and #5, and drew the covers of #1-7.

Fury continued to make appearances in the other Marvel books, from ''Fantastic Four'' to ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. In 1972, ''Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos'' celebrated its 100th issue with a present-day reunion of the squad, sponsored by [[Stan Lee]] and the creative team behind the title. (Lee, like other comic books professionals, has made occasional cameos in his own books, in a tradition going back to the 1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]).

New S.H.I.E.L.D. stories did not appear for nearly two decades after the first solo title{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. A six-issue [[miniseries]], ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (June-Nov. 1988) was followed by ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' <!--official title per postal indicia, per GCD--> vol. 2. This second series lasted 47 issues (Sept. 1989 - May 1993); its pivotal story arc was "the Deltite Affair", in which many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with Life Model Decoys in a takeover attempt.

A year after that series ended, the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Fury'' (May 1994) [[retconned]] the events of those previous two series, recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of HYDRA head [[Baron Strucker|Baron von Strucker]]. The following year, writer [[Howard Chaykin]] and penciller Corky Lehmkuhl produced the four-issue miniseries ''Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' (April–July 1995). Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury's solo adventures, such as the [[graphic novel]]s and one-shots ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] - Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection'' (1989), ''Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising'' (Oct. 1994), ''Fury/[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]: Death Duty'' and ''[[Captain America]]/Nick Fury: Blood Truce'' (both Feb. 1995), and ''Captain America/Nick Fury: The Otherworld War'' (Oct. 2001). He also starred in the 2004-2005 ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries.

==Fictional character biography==
{{In-universe|date=July 2010}}

===Early life and wartime===
Nicholas Joseph Fury is the eldest of three children born to Jack Fury in [[New York City]]. His father is a [[United States]] citizen who enlists in the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Flying Corps]] during [[World War I]]. Jack enlists in 1916 and is stationed in [[France]]. He reportedly shoots down [[Manfred von Richthofen]] early in his flying career, and is a highly decorated combat [[aviator]] by the end of the War in 1918.

Discharged after the War, Jack returns home, marries an unnamed woman, and becomes the father of three children. Nick, probably born in the late 1910s or early 1920s, is followed by Jacob "Jake" Fury (later the [[supervillain]] [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] who co-founded the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] cartel), and their sister, Dawn.

All three children grow up in the neighborhood known as [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]]. Nick is an amateur [[Boxing|boxer]] through the [[Police Athletic League]] where he also learns marksmanship. With his friend Red Hargrove, he eventually leaves the neighborhood to pursue his dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring [[wing walking]] and parachuting act. Their death-defying stunts while training British [[Commando]]s in 1940 catch the attention of [[Lieutenant]] [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer]], then serving with the British Commandos, who enlists them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]]. Nick and Red later join the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with Fury undergoing Basic Training under a Sergeant Bass. Nick and Red are stationed together at [[Schofield Barracks]], [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ambushes the base on December 7, 1941.  Red is among the many killed in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], with Fury swearing vengeance against both the Japanese and the Nazis.

Sawyer, now a [[Captain (land)|captain]], assigns Fury command of the First Attack Squad, a unit of [[U.S. Army Ranger]]s, who are awarded the honorary title of Commandos by [[Winston Churchill]] after their first missions. They are nicknamed the "[[Howling Commandos]]" and stationed at a military base in [[England]] to fight specialized missions, primarily but not exclusively in the [[European Theatre of World War II]].<!--Howlers fought in Okinawa and elsewhere; Izzy was imprisoned for several issues as a POW in Japan-->
During this period, Fury falls in love with an English [[nurse]], Lady Pamela Hawley, who dies in a bombing raid on London before he can propose to her.

===C.I.A.===
At the [[end of World War II in Europe]], Fury is severely injured by a land mine in [[France]], and is found and healed by a Berthold Sternberg, who uses him as a test subject for his '''Infinity Formula'''. After making a full recovery, Fury begins working for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), precursor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Six months into his service, he learns the extent of Sternberg's life-saving operation: the Infinity Formula has retarded his aging, but if he does not receive annual doses, he will age rapidly and die. The doctor begins a 30-year period of extorting large sums of money from Fury in exchange for the injections. These events, culminating in the end of said extortion, are detailed in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #31 (Dec. 1976): "Assignment: The Infinity Formula," by writer [[Jim Starlin]] and artist [[Howard Chaykin]].
[[Image:StrangeTales168-NickFury.jpg|left|thumb|A rare quiet moment for Nick Fury: Splash panel, ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #168 (May 1968). Art by Steranko and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
Fury segues into the CIA as an espionage agent, gathering information in [[Korea]], where he earns a battlefield promotion to [[colonel]]. During this time, he recommends the recruitment of married agents [[Richard and Mary Parker]], who will go on to become the parents of Fury's occasional superhero ally [[Spider-Man]]. Much later, the CIA uses him as a liaison to various superpowered groups that have begun appearing, <!--deleted "in the 1960s" due to Marvel's "elastic chronology" that puts the early-'60s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories--> including the [[Fantastic Four]], whom CIA agent Fury first encounters in ''Fantastic Four'' #21 (Dec. 1963). Despite Marvel's "elastic chronology", which puts the early-'60s stories as roughly only 10 years before modern-day stories, Marvel has never retconned an explanation for that chronological discrepancy, as the company has for many others.

During his time with the CIA, Fury begins wearing his trademark [[eyepatch]] (an issue of ''Sgt. Fury'' had revealed that he had taken shrapnel to one eye during the war, which caused him to slowly lose sight in it over the course of years).

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
Recruited by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], Fury becomes the second commander of S.H.I.E.L.D. Initially, his organization's primary nemesis is the international terrorist organization HYDRA, created by Fury's worst enemy of the Second World War, Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker]] (after [[retcon]]ning of the original continuity). Under Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D. grows into one of the world's most powerful organizations, reaching covertly into national governments and forming strategic alliances with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and other [[superhero]] groups, while always maintaining independence and deniability. Fury soon becomes the superhero community's main contact when government-related information is required in order to deal with a crisis.

After years at the helm, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA have both fallen under the control of a group of sentient [[Life Model Decoy]] androids known as Deltites. Betrayed, Fury goes to ground, hunted by his fellow agents, many of whom are later revealed to have already been replaced with Deltites.  Although Fury ultimately exposes and overcomes the Deltite threat, the conflict is so destructive to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s personnel and infrastructure, and leaves Fury so disillusioned, that he chooses to disband the agency to prevent it from again being subverted from within.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1988)</ref>

Fury rebuilds S.H.I.E.L.D. from the ground up, initially as a more streamlined agency small enough for him to personally oversee and protect from being corrupted. This new incarnation changed the acronym to stand for "Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate".

Sometime later, Frank Castle, the [[vigilante]] known as the [[Punisher]], is captured and sent to a maximum-security facility with a S.H.I.E.L.D. escort. During a hypnosis session with [[Doc Samson]], a character named Spook interrupts and has the Punisher conditioned to believe Fury is responsible for the murder of the Punisher's family. An escaped Punisher eventually kills Fury, who is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>''Over the Edge: Omega'' (Oct. 1995)</ref> However, the Fury that the Punisher has "killed" is later revealed to have been a highly advanced Life Model Decoy android.<ref>''Fury/Agent 13'' #1-2 (June–July 1998).</ref>

Returned to his post as S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Fury independently enlists the [[superhero]]es [[Captain America]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] to launch a covert assault on the leadership of [[Latveria]], which is plotting a massive attack on the U.S. One year afterward, Latveria launches a counterattack that results in Fury's removal as S.H.I.E.L.D. commander, forcing him again into hiding with numerous international warrants out for his arrest. His successors as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. are first [[Maria Hill]] and then [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].<ref>''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #1-5 (April 2004 - Dec. 2005)</ref> Both Hill and Stark, keeping Fury's disappearance from the S.H.I.E.L.D. rank and file, uses Life Model Decoys to impersonate Fury on occasion.

Fury is the only "33rd-degree" S.H.I.E.L.D. officer, meaning he is the only member of S.H.I.E.L.D., present or past, to know the full existence of 28 emergency, covert bases scattered across the globe.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2 (Aug. 2006)</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During the time Fury spends in hiding, he learns that [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]] has been plotting to extract S.H.I.E.L.D. passcodes from him and kill him. Fury kills her first, after which she reverts to the form of an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] shape-shifter from the hostile [[Skrull]] race, which has mounted an [[Secret Invasion|invasion of Earth]]. He recruits [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] to be his mole inside both [[HYDRA]] and S.H.I.E.L.D., and to watch for further Skrull impostors. Unbeknownst to him, she's replaced shortly after by Skrull Queen [[Veranke]] herself.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #12</ref> He later instructs former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]] to recruit superpowered children of various heroes and villains to help combat the Skrull invasion; these include [[Phobos (Marvel Comics)|Phobos]], the 10-year old son of [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and himself the young god of fear; Yo-Yo, a misunderstood mutant speedster; [[Howling Commandos#Secret Invasion|Hellfire]], a relative of [[Phantom Rider]] with supernatural powers; Druid, a magician and son of [[Doctor Druid]]; and Stonewall, a young man who can grow bigger at will and has super strength. Fury dubs them his "Commandos".<ref>Marvel press material, including [http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.4009.Secret_Invasion_Illumination~colon~_Secret_Warriors "Secret Invasion Illumination: Secret Warriors", by Marc Storm, June 19, 2008], refers to the team as the "[[Secret Warriors]]".</ref>

Soon after the attack on Earth, Fury and his new team are seen counter-attacking the Skrull attack in [[Times Square]], Manhattan. They manage to repel and kill the invaders in the area significantly, whilst saving the downed [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] cadets and the [[Young Avengers]].<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #4</ref> He, along with his team and the rescued heroes, are next seen working and planning their next move in one of the scattered 28 covert S.H.I.E.L.D. bases.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5</ref> He has also been seen talking to [[Deadpool]], while Deadpool was on a Skrull ship after pretending to join them. It is also revealed that Fury hired Deadpool to infiltrate Skrull ranks by pretending to defect, with the intention of obtaining biological information of the Skrulls that Fury can use to stop them. However, when Deadpool attempts to transmit the data, it is intercepted by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Deadpool'' #3 (2008)</ref>

Fury leads the survivors of the Young Avengers and Initiative back to the fight in New York, where they are joined by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the new [[Bucky|Captain America]], the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]], the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s gang, and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], to take on [[Veranke]]'s army of Super Skrulls.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>

When the battle is over and the real heroes are found, Nick is greeted by the real Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and [[Dum Dum Dugan]]. He gives them one look and teleports away with his [[Secret Warriors]], not speaking to his former friends.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref>

===Dark Reign and Secret Warriors===
During an infiltration and elimination of a covert S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Chicago, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is, and always has been, secretly controlled by HYDRA.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #1</ref> A distraught Fury now plans to use his Secret Warriors to combat the renewed HYDRA threat, spearheaded by his old nemesis, [[Baron Strucker]].<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2</ref> He also hires the new [[Howling Commandos]], a [[private military company]] formed by 1200 former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who refused to join [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], to employ them in his fight against HYDRA and Osborn.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #4</ref> Also, he has a number of inside men to assist in his raids,<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #5</ref> including [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanova]] posing as [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]] who is in command of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133-134</ref> Eventually, he and his men commandeer decommissioned Helicarriers, as well as forcing the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents at the dock to follow him.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #6</ref> Natasha brings [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] to Fury, but she is followed and the three are captured by the Thunderbolts. Osborn then shoots Fury in the head.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #135</ref> However, it was not the real Fury who was shot, but a [[Life Model Decoy]] in his image,<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #8</ref> which the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] reveals to Songbird and Black Widow later after they escape the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136</ref>

On a solo mission soon after, Fury teams with Norman Osborn to interrogate a lower-level H.A.M.M.E.R. agent. The conversation (and materials obtained afterwards) reveal there may be an organization much like HYDRA, installed in the upper levels of world governments, called "Leviathan." This organization appears to have been founded by the Soviet government for reasons as yet unclear.<ref>"Dark Reign: The List - Secret Warriors"</ref> Fury later introduces Daisy Johnson to prominent members of the Howling Commandos including [[Alexander Goodwin Pierce|Alexander Pierce]], leader of the second caterpillar team, and [[Scorpio (comics)#Scorpio (Mikel Fury)|Mikel]], Fury's son and leader of the "gray" team.<ref>''Secret Warriors #11'' #136</ref>

===Siege===
Fury and the Secret Warriors are later summoned by [[Captain America]] to his hideout along with the New and Young Avengers, when Rogers, seeking to aid his long-time comrade Thor in his plight during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]] launched by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], gathered all his allies to strike back against Osborn and rescue Thor whilst simultaneously ending Osborn's [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]. Fury insists on Phobos remaining behind due to an unwillingness for him to battle his father Ares and his youth, and later opens a wormhole aboard ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. jet which brings the combined forces of the three teams to Oklahoma.<ref>''Siege #2''</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24874 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege" #2 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=February 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref> They then intercept Norman Osborn's siege and with the help of Iron Man, who receives a variation of his suit from [[Speed (comics)|Speed]], they shut down Norman's suit.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Nick Fury's aging has been slowed greatly by the Infinity Formula, a serum created by Dr. Berthold Sternberg. Fury was first inoculated with the serum in the 1940s. Fury took the serum annually for many years. Due to its cumulative effect, Fury no longer needs additional doses to prolong his life span.  Nick Fury is a highly athletic man despite his advanced chronological age. He has 95% vision loss in his injured left eye, over which he wears a cosmetic eyepatch.

Fury is a seasoned unarmed and armed combat expert, was a heavyweight boxer in the army (during [[World War II]]), and holds a black belt in [[Tae Kwon Do]] and a brown belt in [[Jujutsu|Jiu Jitsu]]. He has honed his unarmed combat skills sparring with [[Captain America]].

Fury is a combat veteran of three wars, [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]], as well as numerous "military advisor" missions and clandestine operations ("a dozen conflicts you've never even heard of"). He is trained as a [[paratrooper]], [[United States Army Ranger|Ranger]], a [[demolition]]s expert, vehicle specialist (including aircraft and seagoing vessels), and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]].

Fury has access to a wide variety of equipment and weaponry designed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] technicians.  He wears a S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform made of 9-ply [[Kevlar]] (able to withstand ballistic impact up to .45 caliber bullets) and a Beta Cloth (type C), a fire-resistant material whose kindling temperature is {{convert|1700|°F|°C}}.

Fury uses various types of handguns, including a .15 caliber needle gun, a [[M1911|government issue .45 caliber automatic]], a captured German [[9x19mm Parabellum|Luger]] in [[9x19mm Parabellum|9mm Parabellum]], a modified semi-automatic [[Walther PPK]] in 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum, and the Ingram [[MAC-10]] machine pistol in .45 caliber.

As the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury has access to the entire S.H.I.E.L.D. highly advanced arsenal of weaponry, and various air, land, and sea craft provided by S.H.I.E.L.D., and numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. paraphernalia including a radio-link tie, and a bulletproof suit. Due to his high-ranking status, even when S.H.I.E.L.D. was directed by first Tony Stark and then Norman Osborn, Fury is shown able to retain access to several S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouses and paraphernalia, unknown to anyone else but him.

==Parodies and homages==
{{Trivia|date=September 2008}}
* The three-page opening sequence of ''Captain America'' (2004 series) #23 (Dec. 2006) is a panel-by-panel homage to writer-artist [[Jim Steranko]]'s influential ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1 (June 1968).
* The cover of ''Wolverine'' (2003 series) #27 (April 2005) is an homage to the cover of ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #4.
* The 50/50 variant cover to Iron Man (2004 series) #15 (February 2007) by Adi Granov is also an homage to that same cover.
* Another homage of the same cover was made this time using [[She-Hulk]] during the "Planet without a Hulk" storyline.
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' paid homage to parts of that same sequence, as well as to the [[Comics vocabulary|splash page]] of "If Death Be my Destiny" in ''Strange Tales'' #166 (March 1968), in the [[Krusty the Klown]] parody "Krusty, Agent Of K.L.O.W.N." in ''[[Simpsons Comics]]'' #3 (March 1994). Fury was again spoofed along with Dum Dum Dugan in [[Simpsons Comics]] #118.
* ''[[The Tick (1994 TV series)|The Tick]]'' [[animated TV series]] has included secret agent Jim Rage, Agent of SHAVE. Unlike Nick Fury, there's nothing wrong with his eye; he wears the patch just to look cool.
* [[Jim Valentino|Valentino]]'s comic book parody ''[[normalman]]'' featured Sgt. Fluffy, Agent of S.C.H.M.U.C.K. (which stands for nothing in particular), whose patch switched eyes from frame to frame.
* The satirical magazine ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' parodied Nick Fury in "Nick Penis and the Brassball Brigade", as well as "[[G. Gordon Liddy]], Agent of C.R.E.E.P.".
* In the film ''[[True Lies]]'', [[Charlton Heston]] portrays Spencer Trilby, an obvious homage to Nick Fury,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} in which he is the leader of a covert counter-intelligence organization much like S.H.I.E.L.D.  Heston's character also sports an eye patch in the film.
* In the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode "[[As You Were (Buffy episode)|As You Were]]", [[Xander Harris]] sarcastically refers to commando Riley Finn and his new wife as "Nick and Nora Fury", a reference to both the Marvel character and to the protagonists of the [[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]] film series, detectives [[Nick and Nora Charles]]. Xander would later lose his own left eye and wear a patch (and attire) much like Nick Fury, requesting in the 2007 ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer season eight|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' comic-book series that he be referred to as "Sgt. Fury".
* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', Fury is mentioned as being among a group of military officers hoping to take power from President [[J. R. Ewing]] after the collapse of the United Socialist States of America.
* Ian Roberts of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] revealed on the Season 1 DVD commentary that the character of Antoine was modeled after Nick Fury after the aborted first pilot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
* The character of Col. Hunter Gathers in a number of episodes of ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' is a nod to Nick Fury (along with [[Hunter S. Thompson]]) as is the Office of Secret Intelligence, a nod to S.H.I.E.L.D.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* In the [[Nextwave]] series, the title team works for [[H.A.T.E.]], run by [[Dirk Anger]], an over-the-top parody of Fury.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}
* In the [[Zuda Comics]] webcomic 'DRACULA VS SANTA', Santa's head of security is a Nick Fury look-a-like elf named Nick Frosty.<ref>[http://www.zudacomics.com/node/1074 Dracula vs Santa at Zuda Comics]</ref>
