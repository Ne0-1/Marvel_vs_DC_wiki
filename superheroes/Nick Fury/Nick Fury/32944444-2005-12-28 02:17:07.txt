'''Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] army hero and [[spy]], featured in [[Marvel Comics]]. 

Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Fury first appeared in ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #1 (May 1963), a [[World War II]]-based title that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite army unit. 

The modern day Fury, a [[CIA]] agent, debuted a few months later and, in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #135 (August 1965), the character was completely transformed into a suave, [[James Bond]]-like spy and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Although artistically influential, the series ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' did not outlast the 1960s and subsequent Fury series have been sporadic and unremarkable.

Still, the character makes frequent appearances in Marvel [[comic book]]s as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and an intermediary between the U.S. government or the [[United Nations]] and various [[superhero]]es.

==History==
Nicholas Joseph Fury was the eldest of three children born to Jack Fury. His father was a [[United States]] citizen who enlisted in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] during [[World War I]]. This minor [[Marvel Universe]] [[hero]] only starred in ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #76 (March, 1970). According to the issue Jack enlisted in the Corps in 1916 and was stationed in [[France under the Third Republic]]. He reportedly managed to shoot down [[Manfred von Richthofen]] early in his flying career. He was a highly-decorated combat [[aviator]] by the end of the War in 1918.

Jack Fury was apparently discharged following the end of the War and returned to his native United States. He married an unnamed woman and became father of three. The eldest, Nicholas Joseph Fury was probably born in the late 1910s to mid 1920s. He was followed by Jacob "Jake" Fury, later the [[supervillain]] [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], who co-founded the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] cartel, and their only sibling, sister Dawn Fury.

All three children grew up in the neighbourhood known as [[Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], [[New York]]. Nicholas was an amateur [[Boxing|boxer]], a good skill to have in a tough neighbourhood. He was a good friend to Red Hargrove, and the two of them eventually left the neighborhood to pursue their dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring wing-walking act.

Their death-defying stunts caught the attention of [[Lieutenant]]
Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer, who enlisted them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]].

Nicholas and Red later joined the [[United States Army]]. He was stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ambushed the base on [[7 December]] [[1941]]; Red Hargrove was among the many killed in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].

Lt. Sawyer, now a [[captain]], assigned Fury the command of the First Attack Squad, the "Howling Commandos," a band of rip-snorting [[commando]]s who were stationed in a military base in [[England]], and assigned the most dangerous missions of the [[European Theatre of World War II]]. The Howling Commandos consisted of [[Corporal]] Thaddeus Aloysius Cadwallander "Dum Dum" Dugan, [[Private (rank)|Private]] Gabriel Jones (the first [[Blacks|black]] man to serve in a [[Whites|white]] unit), Private Reb "Rebel" Ralston, Private Dino Manelli (modelled after [[Dean Martin]]), Private Eric Koenig (a defector from [[Nazi Germany]]), Private Izzy Cohen (the first demonstrably [[Jewish American]] comic book hero), and Private Jonathan "Junior" Juniper (killed in action, replaced with Private Percival "Pinky" Pinkerton).

Their earliest chronological (but not first published) assignment occurred in [[Autumn]], 1942. Their assignment was to recover British rocket scientist Dr. MacMillan from a German military base near occupied [[Paris]]. Their success brought them to the attention of [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Winston Churchill]] who incorporated the unit to the [[British Army]].

The adventures of Nick Fury and the First Attack Squad were brought to life in the pages of ''Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos'', in which the unit fought the likes of the [[Red Skull]] ([[Adolf Hitler]]'s bellboy turned supervillain), [[Baron Strucker]], the first [[Baron Zemo]], and many other [[Axis Powers|Axis]] villains. They also fought alongside [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky]] in issue #13, and Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in issue #3. The series lasted for 120 issues before going into reprints (the last original story, #120, was published in 1974). After 47 reprint issues, the series finally ended in 1981. The series ran concurrently with another, short-lived Marvel [[World War II]] book, ''Captain Savage & His Leatherneck Raiders'' (later titled ''Captain Savage & His Battlefield Raiders'').  An issue of the later series featured the foundation of [[HYDRA]] in [[Japan]].

At the [[end of World War II in Europe]], Fury was severely injured by a landmine in [[France]], and was found and healed by a Berthold Sternberg. Professor Sternberg used him as a test subject for his "Infinity Formula," and he made a full recovery.

Nick Fury worked for the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] after the war, gathering intelligence in [[Korea]]. Six months into his service, he learned the extent of Sternberg's life-saving operation: '''the Infinity Formula''' retarded his aging, and if he didn't receive annual doses of the Infinity Formula, he would age rapidly and die. The doctor began a thirty-year period of extorting large sums of money from Fury in exchange for the Infinity Formula. These events, and the  end of said extortion, were detailed in 1976's ''Marvel Spotlight'' #31: "Assignment: the Infinity Formula," by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Howard Chaykin]].

Fury was sent to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] as an espionage agent, gathering information in Korea, where he earned a battlefield promotion to [[Colonel]]. The CIA used him as a liaison to various super-powered groups that began appearing popping up in the 1960s, including the [[Fantastic Four]]. The modern day, CIA-employed Fury first appeared in ''The Fantastic Four'' Vol. 1 #21 (December 1963).

During his time with the CIA, Fury began wearing his trademark [[eyepatch]]. Various reasons have been attributed to this.

In ''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #135, Nick Fury jumped genres from two-fisted war hero to a [[James Bond]]-esque [[Cold War]] spy, and Marvel introduced Colonel Nick Fury (and Marvel readers) to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] (Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division), the Marvel Universe's top-notch spy agency, and [[HYDRA]] (despite the capitalization, it is not an [[acronym]]), an international terrorist organization created by Baron [[Wolfgang von Strucker]] (after some [[retcon|retconning]] of the original SHIELD continuity).

Fury's new adventures were detailed in ''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #135-168, and then he got his own series: ''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', its early issues written and pencilled by [[Jim Steranko]], known for his op/art work. Unfortunately, this series only lasted 15 issues before it was cancelled.

Fury continued to make appearances in the other Marvel books, from ''The Fantastic Four'' to ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. In 1972, ''Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos'' celebrated their 100th issue with a reunion of the Commandos, sponsored by [[Stan Lee]] and the creative team behind the title. (Lee, like other comics professionals, has made occasional appearances, in a tradition going back to the [[Golden Age of comic books]].)

In 1988, Marvel produced the six-issue ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' miniseries, following it up with a second ''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' series. In 1991, Marvel changed S.H.I.E.L.D. to stand for "Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage and Logistics Directorate" (the acronym still made no sense). A pivotal event of the second series was "the Deltite Affair," where S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with Life Model Decoy androids. The second series lasted 47 issues, ending in 1993 (some say it went out with a whimper), and the two books made controversial changes to the character of Nick Fury, and resurrecting (again) Baron von Strucker.

In 1994, the ''Fury'' one-shot [[retcon]]ned the events of ''Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and the second ''Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' series into a series of events designed to distract Fury from von Strucker's resurrection plans. Also in 1994, Howard Chaykin wrote a well-received, four-issue ''Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' limited series.

In the 1995 "Over the Edge" crossover, [[the Punisher]] is captured and sent to a maximum-security facility with a S.H.I.E.L.D. escort. During a hypnosis session with [[Doc Samson]], a character named Spook interrupts and has the Punisher conditioned to believe Fury was responsible for murder of the Punisher's family's. An escaped Punisher eventually killed Fury, who was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

However, in the ''Fury/Agent 13'' two-issue limited series, it is revealed/[[retcon]]ned that the Nick Fury the Punisher "killed" was a highly-advanced Life Model Decoy and that Fury was never dead.

Fury has since made a number of appearances in other Marvel books, including ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[Deathlok]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', and books in the "[[Marvel Knights]]" imprint.

==Alternate Versions==
[[Image:PULSE007 COV.png|thumb|right|Art from the cover to ''The Pulse'' #7, by Mike Mayhew. Featured are Nick Fury, along with [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and [[Ben Urich]].]]
Different versions of Nick Fury, not part of the regular [[Marvel Universe]], have appeared from time to time, including:
*In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] is a significant figure. His characteristics are similar, although he ranks General in this continuity.  Notably, he is portrayed as African-American; the character is modelled after [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Based on the liner notes in hardback "Ultimates," this is with Jackson's consent.
*The ''Fury'' miniseries under the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint imagined a world where Fury was a burned-out Cold War vet unable to cope with the modern world.  This version, created by [[Garth Ennis]], continues to appear in Ennis' [[Punisher]].
*In the 1996 Marvel/DC [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam]] comic ''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Nick Fury appeared as a retired army colonel alongside [[Sgt. Rock|General Frank Rock]].
*In the miniseries [[1602 (comic)|1602]] Nick Fury appears as Sir Nicholas Fury, [[Queen Elizabeth I]]'s chief of intelligence. His character was modeled after Elizabeth's real life spymaster [[Francis Walsingham|Sir Francis Walsingham]].
*A throw-away scene in [[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]] #11 shows a character with an eyepatch and a cigar being shot in the head by a villain in a flashback introducing John Stone, Agent of S.T.O.R.M. (himself a pastiche of Nick Fury and James Bond).
*National Lampoon parodied Nick Fury in "Nick Penis and the Brassball Brigade".  Nick and his men are night-dropped (without parachutes- they're tough) into a German P.O.W. camp where the staff consists of lesbian Nazis who force American P.O.W.s to knit sweaters and turn homosexual.  Nick and the Brassball Brigade rape the lesbian Nazis ("give 'em a taste of pink steel, boys!") and free the Allied prisoners before the P.O.W.s can decide "that maybe it's okay to take it up the ass or stick it to little boys."
*In Marvel comics's Earth X continuity, Nick Fury is dead. however several LMDs ([[life model decoy]]) have copied him and are running around the world and fighting "no-good pinko commies"!

==Movies and television==
[[Image:Nickfuryhasselhoff.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hasselhoff]] as Nick Fury.]]
[[David Hasselhoff]] portrayed Fury in a 1998 ''Nick Fury'' [[TV movie]]. Phillip Abbot did Fury's voice in the 1994 ''[[Spider-Man (animated series)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Iron Man (animated series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, [[Jim Byrnes]] did Fury's voice in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated series, and [[Mark Gibbion]] did Fury's voice in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]''. [[Paramount]] is also developing a live-action major motion picture.

Franky Cook, a character played by [[Angelina Jolie]] in the film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', seems to have some elements of Nick Fury, including the uniform and eyepatch, and she commands a flying aircraft carrier which is reminiscent of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]].
