'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thanos|of the same name]]. He is portrayed by [[Damion Poitier]] in his original appearance in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), and by [[Josh Brolin]] in subsequent appearances. In the films, Thanos is an alien warlord from the planet Titan who seeks to bring "balance" to the universe by eliminating half of all living beings in order to stabilize its overpopulation. To achieve this, he aims to collect the six [[Infinity Stones (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Infinity Stones]] and gain god-like powers, which brings him into conflict with both the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], who ultimately join forces to combat Thanos.

The character received universal praise from both critics and fans alike, up to the point where Thanos has been described as "hands down" the best villain of the MCU,<ref name="VillainRank" /> as well as one of the greatest movie villains of the [[21st century]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whatculture.com/film/15-best-movie-villains-of-the-decade|title=15 Best Movie Villains Of The Decade|first=Simon|last=Gallagher|date=October 28, 2019|website=WhatCulture.com|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=January 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128205144/http://whatculture.com/film/15-best-movie-villains-of-the-decade|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-movie-villains-of-the-decade/|title=10 Best Movie Villains From The Past Decade|date=December 11, 2019|website=ScreenRant|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=December 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212152829/https://screenrant.com/best-movie-villains-of-the-decade/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/best-movie-villains-21st-century-indiewire-critics-survey-1202048559/|title=The Best Movie Villains of the 21st Century â€” IndieWire Critics Survey|first1=David|last1=Ehrlich|date=March 4, 2019|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=August 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810223521/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/best-movie-villains-21st-century-indiewire-critics-survey-1202048559/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Creation and development==
[[Jim Starlin]] conceived Thanos during a college [[psychology]] course, and he introduced the character in a 1973 edition of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Starlin originally designed the character as skinny and lanky, but editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested he "beef him up."<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Jim Starlin |url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |website=Adelaide Comics and Books |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the [[Eternals (comics)|Titanian Eternals]]. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, and is able to demonstrate enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and invulnerability among other qualities.

The MCU began building towards Thanos in the first ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Avengers]]'' film, in which [[Damion Poitier]] portrayed the character in an uncredited cameo appearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-thanos-recast-after-avengers-josh-brolin-reason/|title=Why Marvel Recast Thanos After The Avengers|date=January 20, 2020|website=ScreenRant|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=February 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226042418/https://screenrant.com/marvel-thanos-recast-after-avengers-josh-brolin-reason/|url-status=live}}</ref> In May 2014, [[Josh Brolin]] signed a multi-film contract to portray the antagonist, debuting in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014). Thanos was originally going to have a larger role in ''Guardians'', but [[Joss Whedon]] felt that the character needed to be threaded more gently.<ref name="HitFix"/> Screenwriters [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] noted that Thanos' lingering presence in the franchise helped legitimize him as a threat prior to ''Infinity War''. Despite this, little screen time had been devoted to Thanos' history and motivations. Markus stated, "We don't get an element of surprise [with his introduction in ''Infinity War'']... You can count on a lot of scenes where we illuminate a lot about him very early",<ref name="thanoswriters">{{cite web |last1=Sampson |first1=Mike |title=Avengers: Infinity War Writers Tease Thanos' Big Introduction |url=https://screencrush.com/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-writers/ |website=ScreenCrush |language=en |date=April 12, 2016 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=April 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gjGtCMwq?url=http://screencrush.com/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-writers/ |url-status=live }}</ref> with McFeely adding, "It is incumbent upon us to give him a real story, real stakes, real personality, and a real point of view."<ref name="thanoswriters"/>

''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) went through numerous story iterations, and over the course of development Thanos' presence in the film grew. [[VFX]] Supervisor Dan Deleeuw noted "Thanos went from supporting villain to one of the main characters driving the plot."<ref name=hollywoodreporter>{{cite web |last1=Giardina |first1=Carolyn |title=How 'Avengers: Infinity War' VFX Teams Brought Josh Brolin's Thanos to Life |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-vfx-teams-brought-josh-brolins-thanos-life-infinity-war-1178231 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |date=January 25, 2019 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=February 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/7670cgnB0?url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-vfx-teams-brought-josh-brolins-thanos-life-infinity-war-1178231 |url-status=live }}</ref> In one draft, the film was told directly from Thanos' perspective with him serving as narrator.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thanos Originally Narrated Avengers: Infinity War |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462511/thanos-originally-narrated-avengers-infinity-war |website=CinemaBlend |date=November 30, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=December 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208122214/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462511/thanos-originally-narrated-avengers-infinity-war |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite leading the cast in screen time in ''Infinity War''<ref name="ScreenTimeIW" /> and being considered the main character of the film by many, Thanos had a secondary role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). McFeely explained "we had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain [...] You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature."<ref name="26Spoilers" /> Joe Russo stated that after Thanos was successful in ''Avengers: Infinity War'', he is now "done. He did it. He's retired."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Swann |first1=Erik |title=Thanos is retired in Avengers: Endgame |url=https://bamsmackpow.com/2018/12/22/thanos-retired-avengers-endgame/ |website=Bam Smack Pow |date=December 22, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115074427/https://bamsmackpow.com/2018/12/22/thanos-retired-avengers-endgame/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-''Infinity War'', Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act.<ref name="NYMarkusMcFeely" /> Markus explained that the character's early death "reinforced Thanos's agenda. He was done . . . it was like, 'If I've got to die, I can die now.'"<ref name="NYMarkusMcFeely">{{cite web |last1=Itzkoff |first1=Dave |title='Avengers: Endgame': The Screenwriters Answer Every Question You Might Have |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html |website=The New York Times |date=April 29, 2019 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=May 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514173025/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

A major aspect of Thanos' comic book storyline is his attempts to woo the female manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. This plot was omitted from the films, as the filmmakers instead chose to pair the character with [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] and focus on their father-daughter relationship. McFeely explained this choice by noting "[Thanos and Gamora] had a lot of history we wanted to explore" that would add layers to Thanos and would avoid him becoming "the big mustache-twisting bad guy who wants ultimate power just to take over the world and sit on a throne".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Avengers: Infinity War: How They Decided to Split Up the Characters |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |website=Vulture |language=en-us |date=April 30, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=May 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6z65pDbXa?url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Avoiding the Death storyline moved away from the tease Whedon used in ''The Avengers'' with the character, where Thanos felt that by challenging the Avengers, he was courting death. Though the tease was purposely ambiguous, Whedon felt when he featured Thanos he did not know what to do with him and "kind of hung [Thanos] out to dry". Whedon added that "I love Thanos. I love his apocalyptic vision, his love affair with death. I love his power. But, I don't really understand it." Whedon enjoyed the approach the writers and Russos took in ''Infinity War'', giving Thanos "an actual perspective and [making] him feel righteous to himself", since the Death storyline was "not a concept that will necessarily translate".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evangelista |first1=Chris |title=Joss Whedon Admits He Didn't Know What to Do With Thanos |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-thanos/ |website=Slash Film |date=July 24, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115074219/https://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-thanos/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Design and special effects===
Digital Domain worked on creating Thanos for ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', producing over 400 visual effects shots.<ref name="FXGuide" /> The company created a new facial capture [[Application software|application]] called Masquerade, based on the concept of [[machine learning]] through computer algorithms, specifically for the film, beginning work on the system 3â€“4 months before filming began to develop and test it. They presented their results to Brolin, the Russos, and executives from Marvel ahead of filming to demonstrate the subtleties Brolin would be able to bring to the character, which helped inform Brolin how to portray the character.<ref name="FXGuide">{{cite web |last1=Seymour |first1=Mike |title=Making Thanos Face the Avengers |url=https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/making-thanos-face-the-avengers/ |website=fxguide |date=May 7, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=January 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101001325/https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/making-thanos-face-the-avengers/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Before the start of filming, Brolin's facial expressions were captured with ILM's Medusa system, which along with his motion capture data from set, were fed to Masquerade to "create a higher-resolution version of what Brolin did on set" so animators could apply that to the CGI character. Kelly Port, Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor, noted the design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films, but were adjusted more toward's Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.<ref name=hollywoodreporter/>

==Fictional character biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}

===Early life===
Thanos was born around 1,000 years ago on the planet [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]] to A'Lars, a powerful member of the Titans. At some point during his adulthood, Thanos came to realization that the growth of Titan's population would inevitably result into its downfall, proposing to erase half of the planet's population to save Titan. However, his people rejected his solution as pure madness and cast him out. Over time, Thanos witnessed the death of his people until he was the only Titan left.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://screenrant.com/infinity-war-thanos-survived-destruction-titan/|title=How Thanos Survived The Destruction of Titan|website=[[Screen Rant]]|last=Hoffmeyer|first=Corey|date=November 11, 2018|accessdate=December 12, 2020}}</ref>

===Conquest of the Universe===
After seeing what happened to his planet, Thanos concluded that eventually the universe would suffer the same fate, making him believe that his goal was to destroy half of the population of universe setting him on the path to conquest. His conquest leads him to taking control of the [[Chitauri]], Sakaaran, and Outrider armies. He would also rarely take in orphan children from planets including: [[Ebony Maw]], [[Corvus Glaive]], [[Cull Obsidian]], [[Proxima Midnight]], [[Gamora]] and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] who all went under extensive training under Thanos. Eventually, after venturing across the universe, Thanos came across the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]]. Thanos recruits The Other and [[Ronan the Accuser]] to his crusade; The Other hires the Asgardian [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] to retrieve the Space Stone that was being kept on Earth by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], however, Loki was foiled by the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. When Ronan retrieved the Power Stone, he became inspired with its power and attempted to use it on himself while Gamora betrayed Thanos at the same time and further joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], who ultimately defeat Ronan and hide the Power Stone on Xandar. Angered at his recruits' failures, Thanos decides to search for the stones himself.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://screenrant.com/thanos-mcu-marvel-movies-backstory-history-titan-explained/amp/|title= Everything Revealed About Thanos' Backstory In The MCU|website=[[Screen Rant]]|last=Hood|first=Cooper|date=October 6, 2020|accessdate=December 12, 2020}}</ref>

===Search for the Infinity Stones===
{{Main|Avengers: Infinity War}}
At some point, Thanos had reclaimed the Power Stone after destroying Xander. He later intercepts the spaceship carrying the remains of Asgard, following its destruction, to extract the Space Stone that was in Loki's possession, after he had stolen it before Asgard's destruction. In the process, Thanos kills Loki and Heimdall. Thanos sends Maw and Obsidian to Earth after the Time Stone in Dr. [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]]'s possession while Midnight and Glaive go after the Mind Stone in [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]'s possession. Obsidian is defeated while Maw captures Strange who is eventually rescued by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] who kill Maw. Vision and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] are aided by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] in protecting Vision forcing Midnight and Glaive to flee. Meanwhile, Thanos manages to retrieve the Reality Stone from the [[Collector (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Collector]] in Knowhere while encountering the Guardians. Strange, Stark, Peter and the Guardians arrive on Titan where they are attacked by Thanos. There, Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone after having saw possible futures in which only in one they win. Rogers' group take refuge in [[Wakanda]] where they are attacked by Thanos who ultimately retrieves the Mind Stone. Now having all stones in his possession, he uses it to successfully wipe out half the universe. After doing so, Thanos resides on a peaceful planet watching a sunset.

===Endgame===
{{Main|Avengers: Endgame}}
Twenty-three days after Thanos had used the stones, the Avengers reunite on Earth and track Thanos on the planet. There, Thor decapitates Thanos. However, sometime later, a past version of Thanos discovers his future leading him to arrive in the present and confront the Avengers one final time. Prior, the Avengers use the Infinity Stones to bring back the deceased half. During the Avengers final battle against Thanos, Stark acquires the stones and sacrifices himself to erase Thanos.

== Appearances ==
Thanos initially made a non-speaking [[cameo appearance]] in a [[post-credits scene]] of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''The Avengers'' (2012), where he was portrayed by Damion Poitier.<ref name="TheAvengers" /> Josh Brolin portrayed the character in later films, starting with the ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' (2014), although he was uncredited.<ref name="GotG" /> Brolin reprised his role in a post-credits scene at the end of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015),<ref name="AAoU" /> and in ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018) and ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019), where Thanos served as the primary antagonist. Brolin is also set to reprise his role in the upcoming [[Disney+]] animated series, [[What If...?

The MCU's rendition of Thanos has received critical acclaim.

However, this changed in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|phase three]] with well-received villains such as [[Black Panther (film)|Killmonger]] and [[Spider-Man: Homecoming|Vulture]], culminating in Thanos, whose "repudiation of the MCU's narrative worship of its heroes creates a deep uncertainty in our expectation that follows through each encounter toward the inevitable, horrifying conclusion."<ref name="VillainRank" /> George Marston attributed Thanos' success to "the weight behind his character. Like the best villains in media, Thanos sees himself as a hero. It's the power of Brolin's performance that begins to draw viewers into that maniacal goal over and over, almost making Thanos seem likable or perhaps even reasonable, before the utter horror of him actually accomplishing his goal kicks in."<ref>{{cite web |title=Ranking All The Marvel Studios Villains From Worst-To-Best |url=https://www.newsarama.com/38948-ranking-all-23-marvel-studios-villains-from-worst-to-best.html#s29 |website=Newsarama |language=en |date=January 13, 2020 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=September 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921112144/https://www.newsarama.com/38948-ranking-all-23-marvel-studios-villains-from-worst-to-best.html#s29 |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' declared Thanos Marvel's most compelling villain due to his "deep, reflective intelligence" as well as his "profound adherence to his belief system".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cavna |first1=Michael |title=Here's why 'Infinity War's' Thanos is the most compelling Marvel film villain yet |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/05/04/heres-why-infinity-wars-thanos-is-the-most-compelling-marvel-film-villain-yet/ |website=Washington Post |language=en |date=May 4, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115015843/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/05/04/heres-why-infinity-wars-thanos-is-the-most-compelling-marvel-film-villain-yet/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Cultural impact===
Thanos and his snap spawned much audience enthusiasm. The website, ''DidThanosKill.Me'' was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did Thanos Kill You? |url=http://www.didthanoskill.me/ |website=didthanoskill.me |access-date=January 16, 2020 |archive-date=January 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111064346/http://www.didthanoskill.me/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The ending also spawned the creation of the [[Reddit]] subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.<ref name="PolygonRedditBan">{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Julia |title=What happens after Reddit bans more than 350K users because of a joke? |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/11/17552982/thanos-did-nothing-wrong-ban-reddit-mad-snapping |website=Polygon |language=en |date=July 11, 2018 |access-date=January 16, 2020 |archive-date=January 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116015613/https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/11/17552982/thanos-did-nothing-wrong-ban-reddit-mad-snapping |url-status=live }}</ref> Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000, including both of the Russos who subscribed.<ref name="GizmodoRedditBan">{{cite web |last1=Elderkin |first1=Beth |title=Thanos Has Snapped His Fingers and Killed Half of a Subreddit |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/thanos-has-snapped-his-fingers-and-killed-half-a-subred-1827448545 |website=Gizmodo |language=en-us |date=July 9, 2018 |access-date=January 16, 2020 |archive-date=August 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/71tIn63RC?url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/thanos-has-snapped-his-fingers-and-killed-half-a-subred-1827448545 |url-status=live }}</ref> Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying "Here we go, Reddit users," and ending it with a snap.<ref name="BrolinRedditBan" /> Over 60,000 people watched a live [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] stream of the ban occurring, which lasted several hours.<ref name="GizmodoRedditBan" /> The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.<ref name="GizmodoRedditBan" /><ref name="VergeRedditBan">{{cite web |last1=Farokhmanesh |first1=Megan |title=Thanos subreddit successfully bans half its community |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17548768/thanos-subreddit-bans-half-community-marvel |website=The Verge |language=en |date=July 10, 2018 |access-date=January 16, 2020 |archive-date=August 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/71tJI50yc?url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17548768/thanos-subreddit-bans-half-community-marvel |url-status=live }}</ref> Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone.<ref name="PolygonRedditBan" /><ref name="GizmodoRedditBan" /> One Reddit user who participated described the ban as embodying "the spirit of the Internet" with people "banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious".<ref name="VergeRedditBan" /> Andrew Tigani of [[Screen Rant]] said this showed "how impactful the film has already become to pop culture.

A popular tongue-in-cheek fan theory regarding Thanos' defeat in ''Avengers: Endgame'' before the film's release claimed that Thanos would be killed by [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ant-Man]] entering his [[anus]] and then expanding himself, blowing off Thanos' body (jokingly referred to by the portmanteau "Thanus"{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}). Several internet memes were created by this. After the film was released and proved it wrong, Christopher Markus revealed that due to the strong nature of the Titans, Ant-Man would have been unable to expand himself and get simply crushed against the walls of Thanos' rectum.<ref name="26Spoilers" />
