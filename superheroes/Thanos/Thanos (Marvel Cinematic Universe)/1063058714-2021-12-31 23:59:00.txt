'''Thanos''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] [[Thanos|of the same name]]. Portrayed primarily by [[Josh Brolin]], Thanos is depicted as an alien [[warlord]] from the planet [[Titan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Titan]] with a [[Malthusian]] mindset and galactic-spanning [[genocidal]] agenda, seeking to collect the six [[Infinity Stones (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Infinity Stones]] and assemble them in his [[Infinity Gauntlet]] to utilize them to eliminate half of all lifeforms in the universe, believing this will stabilize its [[overpopulation]] and prevent its terminal doom. This brings him into conflict with various teams, including the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], and their allies.

Thanos is a central figure in the "[[Infinity Saga]]", appearing in five films, including ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). Several [[#Alternate versions|versions]] of Thanos from within the MCU [[Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|multiverse]] also appear, notably in ''Endgame'' and the animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'' (2021), with Brolin reprising the role.

The character received acclaim from both critics and fans alike, and has been described as the best MCU villain to date, and one of the greatest film villains of all time.

==Creation and development==
[[Jim Starlin]] conceived Thanos during a college [[psychology]] course. Thanos was first introduced as a villain in a 1973 edition of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Starlin originally designed the character as skinny and lanky, but editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested he "beef him up."<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Jim Starlin |url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |website=Adelaide Comics and Books |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |archive-date=January 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the [[Eternals (comics)|Titanian Eternals]]. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, and is able to demonstrate enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and invulnerability among other qualities.

The MCU began building towards Thanos in the first ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Avengers]]'' film, in which [[Damion Poitier]] portrayed the character in an uncredited cameo appearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-thanos-recast-after-avengers-josh-brolin-reason/|title=Why Marvel Recast Thanos After The Avengers|date=January 20, 2020|website=ScreenRant|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=February 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226042418/https://screenrant.com/marvel-thanos-recast-after-avengers-josh-brolin-reason/|url-status=live}}</ref> In May 2014, [[Josh Brolin]] signed a multi-film contract to portray the antagonist, debuting in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014). Thanos was originally going to have a larger role in ''Guardians'', but [[Joss Whedon]] felt that the character needed to be threaded more gently.<ref name="HitFix"/> Screenwriters [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] noted that Thanos' lingering presence in the franchise helped legitimize him as a threat prior to ''Infinity War''. Despite this, little screen time had been devoted to Thanos' history and motivations. Markus stated, "We don't get an element of surprise [with his introduction in ''Infinity War'']... You can count on a lot of scenes where we illuminate a lot about him very early,"<ref name="thanoswriters">{{cite web |last1=Sampson |first1=Mike |title=Avengers: Infinity War Writers Tease Thanos' Big Introduction |url=https://screencrush.com/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-writers/ |website=ScreenCrush |language=en |date=April 12, 2016 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=April 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gjGtCMwq?url=http://screencrush.com/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-writers/ |url-status=live }}</ref> with McFeely adding, "It is incumbent upon us to give him a real story, real stakes, real personality, and a real point of view."<ref name="thanoswriters"/>

''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) went through numerous story iterations, and over the course of development Thanos' presence in the film grew. [[VFX]] Supervisor Dan Deleeuw noted "Thanos went from supporting villain to one of the main characters driving the plot."<ref name=hollywoodreporter>{{cite web |last1=Giardina |first1=Carolyn |title=How 'Avengers: Infinity War' VFX Teams Brought Josh Brolin's Thanos to Life |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-vfx-teams-brought-josh-brolins-thanos-life-infinity-war-1178231 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |date=January 25, 2019 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=February 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/7670cgnB0?url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-vfx-teams-brought-josh-brolins-thanos-life-infinity-war-1178231 |url-status=live }}</ref> In one draft, the film was told directly from Thanos' perspective with him serving as narrator.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thanos Originally Narrated Avengers: Infinity War |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462511/thanos-originally-narrated-avengers-infinity-war |website=CinemaBlend |date=November 30, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=December 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208122214/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462511/thanos-originally-narrated-avengers-infinity-war |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite leading the cast in screen time in ''Infinity War''<ref name="ScreenTimeIW" /> and being considered the main character of the film by many, Thanos had a secondary role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). McFeely explained "we had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain [...] You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature."<ref name="26Spoilers" /> Joe Russo stated that after Thanos was successful in ''Avengers: Infinity War'', he is now "done. He did it. He's retired."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Swann |first1=Erik |title=Thanos is retired in Avengers: Endgame |url=https://bamsmackpow.com/2018/12/22/thanos-retired-avengers-endgame/ |website=Bam Smack Pow |date=December 22, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115074427/https://bamsmackpow.com/2018/12/22/thanos-retired-avengers-endgame/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-''Infinity War'', Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act.<ref name="NYMarkusMcFeely" /> Markus explained that the character's early death "reinforced Thanos' agenda. He was done . . . it was like, 'If I've got to die, I can die now.'"<ref name="NYMarkusMcFeely">{{cite web |last1=Itzkoff |first1=Dave |title='Avengers: Endgame': The Screenwriters Answer Every Question You Might Have |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html |website=The New York Times |date=April 29, 2019 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=May 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514173025/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

A major aspect of Thanos' comic book storyline is his attempts to woo the female manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. This plot was omitted from the films, as the filmmakers instead chose to pair the character with [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] and focus on their father-daughter relationship. McFeely explained this choice by noting "[Thanos and Gamora] had a lot of history we wanted to explore" that would add layers to Thanos and would avoid him becoming "the big mustache-twisting bad guy who wants ultimate power just to take over the world and sit on a throne."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Avengers: Infinity War: How They Decided to Split Up the Characters |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |website=Vulture |language=en-us |date=April 30, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=May 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6z65pDbXa?url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Avoiding the Death storyline moved away from the tease Whedon used in ''The Avengers'' with the character, where Thanos felt that by challenging the Avengers, he was courting death. Though the tease was purposely ambiguous, Whedon felt when he featured Thanos, he did not know what to do with him and "kind of hung [Thanos] out to dry." Whedon added that "I love Thanos. I love his apocalyptic vision, his love affair with death. I love his power. But, I don't really understand it." Whedon enjoyed the approach the writers and Russos took in ''Infinity War'', giving Thanos "an actual perspective and [making] him feel righteous to himself," since the Death storyline was "not a concept that will necessarily translate."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evangelista |first1=Chris |title=Joss Whedon Admits He Didn't Know What to Do With Thanos |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-thanos/ |website=Slash Film |date=July 24, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115074219/https://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-thanos/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Design and special effects===
Digital Domain worked on creating Thanos for ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', producing over 400 visual effects shots.<ref name="FXGuide" /> The company created a new facial capture [[Application software|application]] called Masquerade, based on the concept of [[machine learning]] through computer algorithms, specifically for the film, beginning work on the system 3â€“4 months before filming began to develop and test it. They presented their results to Brolin, the Russos, and executives from Marvel ahead of filming to demonstrate the subtleties Brolin would be able to bring to the character, which helped inform Brolin how to portray the character.<ref name="FXGuide">{{cite web |last1=Seymour |first1=Mike |title=Making Thanos Face the Avengers |url=https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/making-thanos-face-the-avengers/ |website=fxguide |date=May 7, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2020 |archive-date=January 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101001325/https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/making-thanos-face-the-avengers/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Before the start of filming, Brolin's facial expressions were captured with ILM's Medusa system, which along with his motion capture data from set, were fed to Masquerade to "create a higher-resolution version of what Brolin did on set" so animators could apply that to the CGI character. Kelly Port, Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor, noted the design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films but were adjusted more towards Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.<ref name=hollywoodreporter/>

=== Portrayal ===
Brolin stated that he based his portrayal of Thanos by taking inspiration from [[Marlon Brando]]'s performance as [[Colonel Kurtz]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), saying in an interview in October 2020; "I mentioned Brando in ''Apocalypse Now.'' This guy [Kurtz] who is very elusive and insane but what he is saying makes sense and is poetical". He also added; "I started seeing the parallel which I liked for me. I loved being able to resort to a film like ''Apocalypse Now'' when I was doing something like ''Avengers''."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-04|title=Josh Brolin Had More Freedom Playing Thanos Than Deadpool's Cable|url=https://www.cbr.com/josh-brolin-thanos-deadpool-cable-freedom/|access-date=2021-09-13|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Early life ===
Thanos was born approximately 1,000 years ago on the planet [[Titan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Titan]] to A'Lars, along with his brother [[Eros (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eros]]. At some point, Thanos came to realize that the growth of Titan's population would inevitably result in its downfall due to lack of resources, and so he proposed to kill half of the planet's population at random. However, his people rejected his solution as pure madness and cast him out. Over time, Thanos witnessed the death of his people until he was the only surviving member of the Titan race.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://screenrant.com/infinity-war-thanos-survived-destruction-titan/|title=How Thanos Survived The Destruction of Titan|website=[[Screen Rant]]|last=Hoffmeyer|first=Corey|date=November 11, 2018|access-date=December 12, 2020}}</ref>

=== Balancing the universe ===
{{further|The Avengers (2012 film)|Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}
After witnessing Titan's fate, Thanos concluded that other planets would eventually suffer the same fate, and believed that it was his destiny to eliminate half of the universe's population so that the survivors may thrive. He takes command of a warship, the ''[[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sanctuary II|Sanctuary II]]'', and embarked on a campaign of conquest. Thanos took control of various alien armies, including the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]], the [[Sakaar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sakaaran]], and the [[Outriders (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Outriders]]. He also forged alliances with [[The Other (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the Other]] and [[Ronan the Accuser (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ronan the Accuser]]. Thanos would also occasionally take in orphan children from planets he invaded, including [[Ebony Maw (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ebony Maw]], [[Corvus Glaive (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Corvus Glaive]], [[Cull Obsidian]], [[Proxima Midnight (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Proxima Midnight]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Thanos gave special attention to Gamora, whom he considered his favorite. Eventually, Thanos learned about the six [[Infinity Stones]] and the powers they could grant him. Prior to 2012, he found the Mind Stone and placed it within a [[Loki's scepter|scepter]].

In 2012, Thanos directs the Other to meet [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], providing him with the Mind Stone scepter and sends him to Earth to retrieve the Space Stone kept within the [[Space Stone|Tesseract]] in exchange for a Chitauri army to subjugate the planet. Following Loki's defeat by the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] and the loss of the Mind Stone, the Other reports about the failed attack on Earth to Thanos.

In 2014, Thanos locates the Power Stone and sends Ronan, Gamora, and Nebula to retrieve it. However, all three eventually turn on him: Gamora joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], Ronan decides to keep the Power Stone for himself and renounces his alliance with Thanos, and Nebula sides with Ronan when he vows to kill Thanos after destroying [[Xandar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Xander]]. The Guardians of the Galaxy defeat Ronan and leave the Power Stone with the [[Nova Corps (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nova Corps]]. Thanos, angered at his recruits' failures, decides to search for the stones himself.

In 2015, Thanos goes to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Nidavellir|Nidavellir]] and forces the native Dwarves to forge the [[Infinity Gauntlet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Infinity Gauntlet]] to hold all six Stones, before killing all of them, except for [[Eitri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eitri]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://screenrant.com/thanos-mcu-marvel-movies-backstory-history-titan-explained/amp/|title= Everything Revealed About Thanos' Backstory In The MCU|website=[[Screen Rant]]|last=Hood|first=Cooper|date=October 6, 2020|access-date=December 12, 2020}}</ref>

=== Infinity War ===
{{further|Avengers: Infinity War}}
In 2018, Thanos, accompanied by his [[Children of Thanos|children]], decimate Xandar and retrieve the Power Stone. Shortly after, they intercept the ''[[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Statesman|Statesman]]'', carrying [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]]ian refugees following their [[Thor: Ragnarok|world's destruction]], and kills half of them, while also incapacitating [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. Thanos attempts to barter the Tesseract from Loki in exchange for Thor's life, but he unleashes the [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]], whom Thanos defeats. After [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] saves the Hulk, Thanos kills him. He then smashes the Tesseract, obtaining the Space Stone, and orders his children to retrieve the Time and Mind Stones on Earth. After killing Loki, Thanos destroys the ''Statesman'', leaving an injured Thor to float in space, and teleports himself and his children away.

Thanos then travels to [[Knowhere (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Knowhere]] and obtains the Reality Stone from the [[Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Collector]]. [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]], [[Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mantis]], and Gamora arrive to try and stop him, but Thanos captures Gamora and teleports away with her. Knowing she had learned the location of the Soul Stone, he coerces into revealing it to him in exchange for sparing Nebula, who he captured and has been torturing. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where the [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Red Skull]] informs them that the Soul Stone requires the sacrifice of a loved one, causing Thanos to tearfully throw Gamora off a cliff to her death.

Thanos arrives on Titan expecting to meet Maw and is ambushed by [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Thanos battles them all and Nebula also arrives to fight him. Thanos is briefly incapacitated but before Stark and Parker can remove the Infinity Gauntlet, Nebula realizes that he murdered Gamora, leading Quill to attack him in a fit of rage. Thanos breaks free of their hold and overpowers them. After mortally stabbing Stark, he prepares to finish him off, but is stopped by Strange, who barters the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.

Teleporting to [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]] to retrieve the Mind Stone, Thanos encounters resistance from Banner, [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]], [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]], and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], but overpowers them. [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] is able to hold him off for a few moments as she kills [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] in order to destroy the Mind Stone. However, Thanos uses the Time Stone to bring Vision back, only to tear out the Mind Stone from his head, killing him a second time. Thanos knocks Maximoff out and places the final Stone in his Gauntlet. However, he is pierced in the chest by Thor's axe, [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)#Stormbreaker|Stormbreaker]]. Badly wounded, Thanos is taunted by a vengeful Thor but manages to snap his fingers, successfully decimating half of all life in the universe and teleports away to the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Garden|Garden]], where he rests.

=== Death and legacy===
{{further|Avengers: Endgame|Eternals (film)}}
Twenty-three days after [[the Blip]], Thanos, now living on the Garden, is ambushed by Rogers, Romanoff, Thor, Rhodes, Banner, [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]], [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and Nebula who seek to obtain the Stones to reverse his actions. They manage to subdue him and Thor cuts off his left arm, only to find the Gauntlet empty. Thanos reveals that he destroyed the Stones to avoid temptation and to make sure that his work would never be undone, prompting Thor to decapitate him. Thanos' actions have a universal impact, and the surviving Avengers work to quell the chaos he caused on the Earth and other planets until finally undoing his actions in 2023. The sudden return of the population has a drastic impact as well, such as on Earth, where its governments attempt to reintegrate the Blipped population, causing [[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier|socioeconomic conflicts]]. One year after the Blip, the phrase "Thanos was right" is seen on a coffee mug, and in [[graffiti]] in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/hawkeye-thanos-was-right-mug-investigation/|title=Hawkeye: Was Thanos Right?

Approximately five years after Thanos is killed, [[Ajak (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ajak]], leader of the [[Eternals (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eternals]], informs [[Ikaris (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ikaris]] that when Thanos erased half of all life in the universe, he inadvertently delayed the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Others#Emergence|Emergence]], saving the Earth and many other planets from complete destruction. She further explains that when the Avengers restored the population, it created the necessary conditions for the Emergence, but also convinced her that the Earth deserved saving.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonomolo |first1=Cameron |title=New Marvel's Eternals Clip References Thanos and Avengers: Endgame |url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvels-eternals-new-clip-references-thanos-snap-avengers-endgame/ |website=comicbook.com |access-date=5 November 2021 |date=30 October 2021}}</ref> After the Eternals stop the Emergence and some of them prepare to locate others of their kind spread across the universe, their ship is boarded by [[Eros (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eros]], an Eternal and brother of Thanos.

== Alternate versions ==
=== Battle of Earth ===
{{Further|Avengers: Endgame}}
In an alternate 2014, Thanos, after conquering a planet, dispatches Gamora and Nebula to Ronan's ship to retrieve the Power Stone. However, he becomes aware of the Avengers using [[time travel]] when Nebula alerts him to the arrival of her future self. Thanos extracts the memories of 2023-Nebula via 2014-Nebula's consciousness. He learns that his future self succeeded and that the Avengers killed him and are attempting to undo his work. He then has the 2014-Nebula impersonate her future self and travel to 2023 so that she can use the [[Quantum Realm]] to bring Thanos and his army there.

The Avengers successfully obtain the Stones and revive Thanos' victims in 2023. Immediately afterwards, Thanos' ship ''Sanctuary II'' exits the Quantum Realm and opens fire on the [[Avengers Compound (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Compound]], destroying it. While his army searches for the Stones, Thanos engages in an intense fight with Stark, Rogers, and Thor, during which he declares that the Avengers' mission to undo his deceased future self's work has hardened his resolve, and that for the universe to be truly balanced, all of existence must be destroyed, rebuilt anew, and repopulated with life that only knows gratitude.

Thanos defeats Stark and Thor, leaving only Rogers left standing. He calls forth his entire army but the restored Avengers, Guardians, [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]]n and Asgardian armies, the [[Masters of the Mystic Arts]], and the [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravagers]] arrive and engage Thanos' and his army in a final battle. After an intense struggle, Thanos obtains the Stark Nano Gauntlet, but before he can snap his fingers, Stark manages to steal the Stones from him. Thanos watches in horror as Stark snaps his fingers, and Thanos, along with his army, is erased from existence.

In an alternate reality, Thanos is killed by Gamora, who claims his warlord position, armor, and sword.

==Appearances==
* Thanos (played by [[Damion Poitier]] and credited as "Man #1") first appears in a [[post-credits scene]] of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', where he is revealed as [[The Other (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the Other]]'s master and [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]'s benefactor, who sent the latter to Earth to obtain the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]].<ref name="TheAvengers" />
* He next appears in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', now played by Josh Brolin (who was uncredited for his role).<ref name="GotG" /> The film introduces Thanos as "The Mad Titan", the adoptive father of [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], and the benefactor of [[Ronan the Accuser (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ronan the Accuser]], whom he sends to retrieve the Power Stone in exchange for an army large enough to decimate [[Xandar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Xandar]]. After obtaining the stone, however, Ronan becomes corrupted by its power, and betrays Thanos to keep it for himself, threatening to kill him after he destroys Xandar. Gamora also betrays Thanos and joins the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], who ultimately defeat Ronan.
* Thanos appears in a post-credits scene of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', donning the Infinity Gauntlet and saying "Fine, I'll do it myself."<ref name="AAoU" />
* In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Thanos embarks on his quest to obtain the six Infinity Stones, clashing with the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], and [[Wakanda]]. He is ultimately successful, despite the deaths of most of his soldiers and being forced to sacrifice Gamora for the Soul Stone, and utilizes the completed Infinity Gauntlet to simultaneously vaporize half of the universe's population, believing that doing so will stabilize its overpopulation and allow the survivors to thrive. Although he is injured by [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], Thanos survives his wound and retreats to a remote planet.
* In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', after retiring to a solitary farmer life, Thanos destroys the Stones to ensure his victory is not undone. Shortly after, he is tracked down by the surviving Avengers and decapitated by Thor. An alternate 2014 version of Thanos later learns about the Avengers' plan to use quantum time travel and past versions of the Stones, and travels to the main timeline with his army to obtain their Gauntlet to repeat his future self's mission, only to go beyond his original goal and instead erase the universe in full, before allowing creation to begin anew. During the battle with the Avengers and their restored allies, Thanos gets a hold of the Gauntlet, but [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] takes the Stones and uses them to wipe out Thanos and his army.
* Archival footage of Thanos killing Loki is shown in a scene of the [[Glorious Purpose|first episode]] of the [[Disney+]] TV series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.
* Alternate timeline versions of Thanos appear in the [[Disney+]] animated series ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'', with Josh Brolin vocally reprising his role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=William|title=Marvel just released an extremely intriguing cast list for Disney+'s animated What Ifâ€¦?|url=https://news.avclub.com/marvel-just-released-an-extremely-intriguing-cast-list-1836569935|access-date=July 21, 2019|website=A.V.

**The first version appears in the [[What If... T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?|second episode]], and is shown to have reformed from his genocidal ways, although he is still called the Mad Titan, and still believes that his plan to kill half of life in the universe had "merits". This version of Thanos is a member of the Star-Lord [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]]'s crew of Ravagers, and has a healthier relationship with his adopted daughter Nebula. In the episode, Thanos joins T'Challa's plot to steal life-giving particles from the vault of Tivan, the Collector, in [[Knowhere]], and in the process fights Cull Obsidian and Proxima Midnight.
**Another version of Thanos makes a non-speaking appearance at the end of the [[What If... Zombies?!|fifth episode]], where he is infected by the Quantum Virus and becomes a zombie. He is shown nearby Wakanda wielding a nearly-completed Infinity Gauntlet, missing only the Mind Stone.
**A third version of Thanos makes a brief non-speaking appearance in the [[What If... Ultron Won?|eighth episode]], where he is killed by [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]] upon arriving on Earth to collect the Mind Stone.

However, this changed in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|phase three]] with well-received villains such as [[Killmonger (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Killmonger]] and [[Adrian Toomes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vulture]], culminating in Thanos, whose "repudiation of the MCU's narrative worship of its heroes creates a deep uncertainty in our expectation that follows through each encounter toward the inevitable, horrifying conclusion."<ref name="VillainRank" /> George Marston attributed Thanos' success to "the weight behind his character. Like the best villains in media, Thanos sees himself as a hero.

Thanos and his "snap" spawned much audience enthusiasm.

A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film.

A popular tongue-in-cheek fan theory regarding Thanos' defeat in ''Avengers: Endgame'' before the film's release, jokingly referred to by the portmanteau "Thanus", claimed that Thanos would be killed by [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ant-Man]] entering his [[anus]] and then expanding himself, blowing off Thanos' body.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 19, 2019|title=Paul Rudd Is Still Bummed About Avengers: Endgame's Thanus Theory|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482677/paul-rudd-is-still-bummed-about-avengers-endgames-thanus-theory|access-date=February 1, 2021|website=CinemaBlend}}</ref> After the film was released and proved the theory wrong, Christopher Markus revealed that due to the strong nature of the Titans, Ant-Man would have been unable to expand himself and would simply be crushed against the walls of Thanos' rectum.<ref name="26Spoilers" />
