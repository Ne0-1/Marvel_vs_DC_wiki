'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Jim Starlin]] and published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[Titan (moon)|Titanian]] [[Eternals|Eternal]] and is often referred to as ''The Mad Titan''. His name comes from the [[Greek language]] word ''[[thanatos]]'', who was the personification of death in greek mythology.

==Fictional character biography==
Thanos was born over four-thousand years ago on the [[Saturn (planet)|Saturnian]] moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], with the Deviant gene, a mutation that gave him a deformed appearance, resembling the cousin race of the [[Eternals]], the [[Deviants]].  Although treated fairly by his fellow people, Thanos grew distant and obsessive.  Thanos was born with more than just superhuman strength, and matured to become the most powerful of the Titanian-born Eternals. (Note that the demonic [[Dragon of the Moon]] has claimed to be the influence of Thanos' evil tendencies.) [[Eros]], (his brother), and Thanos celebrate one another's birthdays every Eternal year (1 Eternal Year equals 1000 Human Years) by rendevousing at a neutral location to exchange gifts and pleasantries.

Thanos, since childhood, has been obsessed with the [[occult]] and, more specifically, [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. Mistress Death is an abstract entity and the actual personification of the universal concept of death. Thanos' obsession developed into a twisted love and devotion. As a boy Thanos was obsessed with knowing why he was different. On one occasion he started nuclear fires as a distraction and kidnapped his mother. He then brutally dissected her. <ref>''[[Silver Surfer]]'' (Vol 3) #67. Mentor stated that very few knew the true story of his wife's death, not even Eros.</ref> Thanos took hundreds-of-millions of lives in mass killings throughout the cosmos to appease his love, attempting to become her male companion.  One nuclear strike by Thanos on the Titan Eternals resulted in millions of deaths, leaving Thanos as Titan's absolute dictator, with Eros and Mentor (his father) forming an underground resistance. Later, Thanos arrived on Earth, killing a family that accidentally saw him land.  Thanos sought dominion of Earth as a stepping stone to his plans of conquering the rest of the galaxy. To this end, Thanos stole the power of Earth's [[Cosmic Cube]], eventually absorbing all its energy to become a god on the level of Kronos, but was defeated by [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the Titanian Eternals. Thanos later came to the conclusion that the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] was a menace to his plans and thus raised the female assassin [[Gamora]], after rescuing her from an alternate reality, to destroy him. He joined forces with [[Adam Warlock]] to defeat Magus, but secretly drained some energy from Warlock's Soul Gem in the process.

After this, Thanos gathered energies all of the other [[Infinity Gems]] to power a machine to destroy all the stars in the universe as a gift to Death. Warlock attempted to prevent this but Thanos killed Gamora, [[Pip the Troll]], and mortally wounded Warlock.  The Avengers, Captain Marvel, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Spider-Man]], and Warlock's spirit (rising up from the Soul Gem) killed Thanos aboard the starship Sanctuary II by turning him into stone.

===Infinity Gauntlet===

[[Image:Thanos2a.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Thanos with the Gems as the heroes converge to attack]]Years later, Thanos was revived by Death, who wanted him to reduce the overpopulation of the universe to one half. Lacking the power to do so on his own, Thanos found the true meaning of the Soul Gems by gazing into Death's Infinity Well. Thanos then created the '''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]''' by stealing the Infinity gems from the [[Elders of the Universe]], making him [[omnipotent]]. Once again he carelessly lost it, this time to the space pirate [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], who claimed to be his granddaughter.  Warlock (having raised himself, Pip, and Gamora from the dead) recognized that Thanos was thwarted not only by intervention of [[superhero|superheroes]], but by his own self-doubt as well.

After Thanos accepted this, he helped Warlock take the Gauntlet from Nebula and, when cornered at the conclusion of the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, activated a nuclear self-destruct mechanism in his costume to deny the heroes a chance to imprison him. However, this was yet another ruse on his part; as he had apparently predicted, the gathered heroes flung him from the shrine honoring Death he had created, at which point he teleported away to a distant, uncharted planet and detonated the nuclear device, thereby successfully faking his own death. (Adam Warlock, as "God," was fully aware of the situation but decided to leave Thanos alive and uncaptured as an integral part of the Universe.)  Thanos began to reform his wicked ways, and, as a test of his vow, was given the Reality Infinity Gem to protect.  Thanos' first act with the Reality Gem was the resurrection of Captain Mar-Vell, which Thanos did hoping to seek his forgiveness, however he refused Thanos' gift and asked him to put him back to rest, which Thanos did.  Thanos would make good on his promise and the trust entrusted him by others, though, helping Earth's heroes to save the universe from a new incarnation of the Magus and from the Goddess, which was Warlock's "benevolent" side given physical form.  He also aided Doctor Strange, Silver Surfer and the Infinity Watch in saving Thor from a bout of madness.

Ultimately, the Infinity Watch disbanded and Thanos returned to villainy. He also made a bid to kill the Celestial Madonna Mantis and her son, but was forced to team up with her to save the universe against the Rot, a creation formed as a result of the relationship shared between Death and Thanos.

In the [[Infinity Abyss]] arc, it was revealed that Thanos conducted research on genetics, studying the universe's heroes and villains, eventually cloning many of them and gene-splicing his own DNA into the subjects. The experiment was quickly forgotten, however, and shelved away for years.  Many of the clones died, with the exception of six, who began to spread evil across the universe under Thanos' name.  Many of Thanos' former associates joined the Thanos' clones, who consisted of X, Warrior, Armour, Mystic and Omega, as well as an unnamed clone that resembled Thanos exactly.

===Epiphany===
Thanos, reflecting on recent events where he had to give up great power to save the universe and coming to terms with himself as being a monster sets out to become a benevolent being and make up for his actions.  On New Rigel-3, to the surprise of everybody he began to use his power for good.  When a great evil called [[Hunger (Marvel Comics|Hunger]] arose that threatened to consume all of existence, Thanos along with [[Adam Warlock]] and [[Pip the Troll]] set out to first kill [[Galactus]]. It was believed that if Hunger could control Galactus that all would be lost.  In the final battle Thanos forced two planets to collide and also detonated a large nuclear arsenal at the point of impact. Caught in the resulting explosion were Hunger and Galactus.  Galactus survived and while Hunger is believed to be dead a tiny remnant of Hunger is depicted removing itself from Galactus' person and then flying through space.

===Samaritan===
Thanos enters the [[Kyln]] finding The Beyonder inside and is now in the company of [[Skreet]].  Thanos mind wipes the [[Fallen One]] and employs him as his own herald; Fallen One was the first herald of Galactus.

===Annihilation===
Thanos currently has a role within Marvel's [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] event, specifically within the [[Silver Surfer]] limited series, in which he has allied himself with [[Annihilus]] because he was "curious to see how a radical tilt in the universal balance would play out."  Upon learning Annihilus' true goal, (using the power of Galactus to destroy all life within the primary universe and Negative Zone while somehow remaining the sole survivor) he decided to turn against Annihilus.  Before Thanos could release Galactus, however, he was killed by [[Drax the Destroyer]] (once again), who ripped his heart out in issue #4. Thanos merely commented, "Hm...interesting." as he looked down at his own heart in Drax's hand.

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos possesses nearly incalculable superhuman power. The most powerful of the Titanian Eternals, Thanos is an Eternal mutant whose massive thick-hided body grants him the ability to synthesize cosmic energy for his personal use. Through bionic amplification, Thanos greatly increased his physical strength and resilience to levels surpassing that of even the strongest of the Earth Eternals (Thanos was able to engage both The Thing and Thor in hand-to-hand combat simultaneosly and hold his own, rendering The Thing unconscious, and beating back Thor).   Through meditation and certain mystical techniques Thanos has augmented his power in still other ways - enabling him to tap, transform, and direct vast quantities of cosmic energy for destructive force.  When resurrected, [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] granted Thanos a new body with greatly increased power despite lacking his previous bionic enhancements.  

Thanos possesses the ability to manipulate matter as well as teleport himself vast distances, a trait he shares with many of the Earth's more powerful Eternals ([[Sersi]] and Ikaris). Certain abilities such as force fields and teleportation are either augmented via technology or accomplished through another means due to the strain some actions, such as teleportation, have on Thanos.  Thanos has also demonstrated psionic abilities (e.g. telepathy, astral projection, mind control). Thanos possesses a very high level of invulnerability, allowing him to endure almost any sort of punishment without being harmed and he is even almost completely resistant to reality manipulation and matter transmutation. Perphaps deadliest of all of Thanos's attributes is his mind; his superhuman intellect and legendary cunning are almost obsessively dedicated to the annihilation of life and the mastery of any technology or mysticism that will alow him to achieve this goal.  

[[Image:Tyrantthanos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tyrant vs. Thanos The Mad Titan]]
According to Thanos himself, he is somehow invisible to [[Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]]; he taunted the [[In-Betweener]] with this revelation after wresting one of the Infinity Gems from him in battle within the pages of the [[Thanos Quest]].  Indeed, when both Lord Chaos and Master Order themselves came to the battle site (where they had imprisoned the In-Betweener some time before), they dealt with the In-Betweener as if he had somehow broken out of his dimensional prison on his own; in fact, it was Thanos himself who breached the confines of the In-Betweener's prison with the help of the In-Betweener from within in ''Thanos Quest'' #1.

In this, he seems to share a similar ability to [[Adam Warlock]], about whom the [[Great Powers of the Universe]] themselves said that his future is unknown even to them.  It has been previously suggested that Thanos is, or was, "invisible" to the Great Powers because the Infinity Gems' power places their wielders outside of the influence of the Great Powers; however, Thanos possessed none of them at the time he confronted the In-Betweener.

Aside from his great power, Thanos is a superb tactician and is well-versed in many areas of arcane lore. He possesses technology that allows him to time-travel and travel through alternate dimensions. Thanos is also a highly formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having fought the likes of the [[Galactus]]-spawned [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]] (with the help of one of Tyrant's own power orbs) and [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], Lord of Asgard, to near stand-stills despite both beings possessing vastly superior power.  Thanos also trained his adopted daughter [[Gamora]] to become one of the universe's most adept and feared female assassins.

==Ultimate Thanos==
[[Image:Ultimatethanos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Emergence of Ultimate Thanos]]

The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Thanos debuts in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #35, and has two sons, Gallowglass and Ronan. The "God War" storyline in which Thanos appears draws not only on the space-faring Marvel characters [[Jack Kirby]] created, but also the [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] characters that Kirby created for [[DC Comics]] as well. When asked about readers' making connections betwen his storyline and Kirby's ''[[The Forever People]]'', [[Mike Carey]] said in an interview, "Some of the characters are best viewed in [the context of the original story of the Fantastic Four's meeting with the Kree].Others call on different Kirby precursors."[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8754] In another interviews, Carey said "God War" "harks back to some very different Kirby concepts and situations, so the way it all fits together I think will genuinely surprise people. To name one thing, Ronan is Thanos's son - and the empire he serves is Thanos's empire, not the Kree. And to name another, Thanos has powers that the 616 Thanos doesn't have, including the very scary one of being able, in some circumstances, to transpose one person's soul into another's body." Carey also said Thanos still had a weird creepy flirtation with Death even though Death has yet to appear in this universe

==Thanos in other media==
===Television===
Thanos appeared in various episodes of the [[The Silver Surfer (TV series)|The Silver Surfer Animated Series]] on the [[FOX Network]]."  In this version, Thanos worships the female personification of Chaos, due to Fox's refusal to allow any use of the word "death" in their children's programming.  Mentor appears in a two-part episode "Learning Curve."  Due to a typo, he is Thanos' brother instead of his father.[http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/toon/lbrody.html]

*In the unproduced, but scripted Season Two, The Silver Surfer would restore the universe which was destroyed in the first part of "The End Of Eternity."  As a result, some people, places and things would have been altered, including a peace-seeking Thanos.  Though his evil persona briefly re-emerges, the good Thanos regains control, and he is left as the master of [[Zenn-La]] [http://www.silver-surfer.us/Animation/Scripts/SS14.html] .

===Video games===
{{wikibooks|Fighting Game Moves/Capcom/Thanos}}
Thanos also appeared as the final boss in the [[Capcom]] games [[War of the Gems]] for [[SNES]] and ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'', both stories adapted from the ''Infinity Gauntlet'' mini-series.  He re-appeared in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' without the Infinity Gems (although he inexplicably uses four of the same Gem-related super moves from his last incarnation - Power, Reality, Space, and Soul; losing Time and Mind - albeit greatly reduced in effectiveness and power).  He also makes a small cameo in [[Marvel Ultimate Alliance]].
