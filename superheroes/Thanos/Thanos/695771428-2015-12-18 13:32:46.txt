'''Thanos''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and was created by writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]]. Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], the character has been featured in over four decades of Marvel continuity and a self-titled series.

Thanos appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'s various films; a cameo during the mid-credits of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), [[Josh Brolin]] portrays the character in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014) and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) and will reprise the role in both parts of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018/2019). The character has appeared in other Marvel-endorsed products, including [[Animation|animated]] television series, [[Arcade game|arcade]] and video games. Thanos was ranked number 47 on IGN's top 100 comic book villains of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/47.html |title=Thanos is Number 47 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>

==Origin==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived of Thanos of Titan during college [[psychology]] classes. As Starlin described:

{{quote|I went to college between doing [[U.S. military]] service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos&nbsp;... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just [[anger management]] probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''[[Iron Man]]''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches&nbsp;... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm "Jim Starlin"]. Adelaid Comics and Books. Archived via the [[Wayback Machine]]. Retrieved March 25, 2014.</ref>}}

Starlin has admitted the character is influenced by [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]]:

{{quote|Kirby had done the [[New Gods]], which I thought was terrific. He was over at [[DC Comics|DC]] at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: "Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!"<ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #266 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref>}}

Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].

Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] and her son Quoi, apparently destined to be the Celestial Messiah.

When an ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]] called Akhenaten uses a [[Heart of the Universe|source of cosmic power]] to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him.

Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003)</ref> However, Marvel's Executive Editor [[Tom Brevoort]] has stated on his [[Tumblr]] blog that this story is not in any way a part of official Marvel continuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/94063615333/so-despite-everyone-else-believing-the-end-was|title=New Brevoort Formspring|work=tumblr.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/107750758608/wait-a-second-wait-a-second-i-just-saw-on|title=New Brevoort Formspring|work=tumblr.com}}</ref>

Thanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it.

En route to the [[Kyln]], an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death, who for the first time speaks to the Titan. Death claims it is worth wooing, but that he must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters [[Star-Lord]] and the [[Shi'ar]] warrior [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], who are both prisoners, and the [[Beyonder]], who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a mortal female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder and causes its mind to shut down, leaving its power trapped within a comatose mortal body.

Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the [[Power Cosmic]] to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus.

Thanos then serves as the season two's primary villain, first coming to Earth in pursuit of the Red Skull while searching for the Power Stone before being blasted to the other side of the galaxy by [[Arsenal]]'s self-sacrifice. Thanos later returns in "Widow's Run" and claims the remaining Infinity Stones from the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], preparing to use the Infinity Gauntlet to rule the universe before he is defeated by the Avengers in "Thanos Triumphant" prior to [[Ultron]] to siphoning the Infinite Stones' energies. Though Thanos is taken away by the Guardians of the Galaxy and placed in Nova Corps custody, he is freed by the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] in season two's two-part finale before he is defeated and rendered incorporeal.

* Thanos appears as a recurring villain in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', voiced again by Isaac C. Singleton Jr.
