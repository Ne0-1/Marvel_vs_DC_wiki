'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[comic book]]s and other [[Mass media|media]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and was created by writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]]. Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], the character has been featured in over three decades of Marvel continuity and a self-titled series. Thanos has appeared in other Marvel-endorsed products, including [[Animation|animated]] television series, [[Arcade game|arcade]] and [[video games]], films, toys, and [[trading cards]]. Thanos was ranked number 47 on IGN's top 100 comic book villains of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/47.html |title=Thanos is Number 47 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

==Origin==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived of Thanos of Titan during college psychology classes. As Starlin described:

{{cquote|I went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos ... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I {{sic|ca|me}} up to Marvel and [editor] [[Roy Thomas|Roy]] [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''[[Iron Man]]''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches ... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060617192251/www.http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm]</ref>}}

Starlin has admitted the character is influenced by [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]]:

{{cquote|Kirby had done the [[New Gods]], which I thought was terrific. He was over at DC at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said : "Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!"<ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #266 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref>}}

Wishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7">''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977)</ref> Seeking universal power in the form of the [[Cosmic Cube]], Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car  as a family witnesses his arrival.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #30 (Jan. 1974)</ref> Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]] and is given a new form as [[Drax the Destroyer]] while the daughter is found by Thanos' father Mentor and is raised to become the heroine [[Moondragon]]. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube.
