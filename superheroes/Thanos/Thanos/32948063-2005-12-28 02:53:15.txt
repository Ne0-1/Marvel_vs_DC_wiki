'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Jim Starlin]] and published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[Titan (moon)|Titanian]] [[Eternals|Eternal]] and is often referred to as ''The Mad Titan''.
His name is from the root of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "[[death]]," ''[[thanatos]]''. He was originally an homage of [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]].

==Character history==
Born on [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Thanos is a [[mutant]] with purple-grey, hide-like skin and a massive body. By means of bionic implants and through long hours of  strength and ability-augmenting meditation, Thanos eventually became the most powerful of the Eternals. As his powers grew, however, so too, did his ambition; he was eventually [[exile|exiled]] from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

Thanos, since childhood, had been obsessed with the [[occult]], specifically with [[death]]. His obsession developed into a twisted kind of love and devotion. Thanos would take hundreds-of-millions  of lives throughout the cosmos, offering the mass-killings as gifts to [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. He eventually became the male companion to Death, who appeared to him in [[female]] form. It is thought that [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] is attracted to his [[philosophy|philosophical]] dedication to [[nihilism]] as well as his willingness to commit [[genocide]] on even his own people. An attack by Thanos on The Titan Eternals resulted in many deaths, including the murder of his mother.

However, after obtaining the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], an immensely powerful cosmic artifact, then losing it, Thanos entered into to a period of introspection.  [[Adam Warlock]] recognized that Thanos' efforts to obtain [[omnipotence]] had been thwarted not only by the intervention of [[superhero]]es but also by Thanos' own self-doubt and anxiety.  Believing the Titan to be capable of change -— and wishing to keep Thanos where he could keep an eye on him -— Warlock made Thanos a member of the [[Infinity Watch]], giving him the [[Reality Gem]], one of the [[Infinity Gems]] which Warlock and the Watch guarded.

Ultimately, the Watch was disbanded, and Thanos returned to villainy, albeit half-heartedly.  He later claimed that these subsequent appearances were all half-formed [[cloning|clone]]s.  After destroying and recreating the universe twice, Thanos apparently gave up his quest for power, though just how long he will refrain from acts of evil is unknown.

==Creator Jim Starlin on Thanos==
[[Image:Thanosstarlin.jpg|right|200px|thumb|left|Interior art from '''Thanos #1'''. Art by Jim Starlin.]]

"Well I had him from a psych. class that I took.  I went to college between the service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych. class and I came up with Thanos… and Drax the Destroyer, but I’m not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably.  So I came up to Marvel and Roy (Thomas) asked if I wanted to do a issue of Iron Man.  I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks.  So they got jammed into it.  Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he’s beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches from Iron Man, and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size."

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos possesses incalculable superhuman power. By far the most powerful of the Titanian Eternals, Thanos is a mutant whose massive heavy-hided body was born with the capacity to synthesize cosmic energy for certain personal uses. (This is a trait that Thanos shares with his father Alars and the Earth-born Eternals but not with Titan-born Eternals). Through still further unknown bionic amplification, Thanos increased his physical strength and resilience to levels possibly rivalling or surpassing even the strongest of the Earth Eternals (Gilgamesh, now deceased). This indicates that Thanos' strength is at least into the Class 100 range, being able to routinely lift well in  excess of 900 tons. Through meditation and certain mystical techniques, Thanos augmented his power in still other ways, enabling him to tap, transform, and direct vast quantities of cosmic energy for destructive force. Deadliest of all of Thanos's attributes, perhaps, was his mind, whose superhuman level of intellect was totally dedicated to the annihilation of life. Thanos has also demonstrated psionic abilities, including telepathy, the limits of which remain unknown.

Aside from his great power, Thanos was a superb tactician and was well versed in many areas of arcane lore.  Thanos was also a highly formidable hand to hand combatant.

==Quotations==
* "I am now omnipotent. What should I do with such almighty power? The answer to that is really quite simple: Anything I want. Anything. I am incapable of error. Any result that displeases me I can simply reverse. There is nothing I need to worry on, for I am Thanos. And Thanos is supreme. Supreme."

* "Am I not Thanos?! Did I not butcher the woman who gave me birth, who force-fed me into this hell called life?! Is not the wake of my passing crimson with the blood of my enemies and allies alike?! Death is with me every second of the day! My every moment is spent in either dealing out death or worshipping it! So tell me, who under the stars is better suited than I to be Death's consort?"

* "You address omnipotence.  Tread carefully."

* "Death, thunderer, is like love-making. It gets better each time."

* "Destiny awaits." (from Marvel Super Heroes arcade game)

In 2003, Thanos received his own ongoing series; it was originally written and illustrated by Jim Starlin, but as of #7 [[Keith Giffen]] took over until its ending with #12.

==Other Media==
Thanos appeared in three episodes of the ''Silver Surfer'' animated series on the [[FOX Network]]: "The End of Eternity," "Battlecry," and "Soul Hunter."  In this version, Thanos worships the female personafication of Chaos, due to Fox's refusal to allow any use of the word 'death' in their children's programming.

{{wikibooks|Fighting Game Moves/Capcom/Thanos}}
Thanos also appeared in [[Capcom]] games ''Marvel Superheroes'' as a character adapted from the ''Infinity Gauntlet'' mini-series.  He re-appeared in the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series without the Infinity Gems (although he inexplicably uses four of the same super moves from his last incarnation, albeit greatly reduced in effectiveness and power).
