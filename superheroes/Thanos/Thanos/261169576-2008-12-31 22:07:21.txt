'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character's name is a derivation of [[Thanatos]], the personification of death and mortality in [[Greek mythology]]. Thanos first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and was created by [[Jim Starlin]].

==Publication history==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived Thanos of Titan during college [[psychology]] classes. As Starlin described:
{{cquote|I went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psyche class and I came up with Thanos ... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I’m not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] Roy [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''Iron Man''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches ... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size. <ref>[http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm Adelaide Comics and Books: Jim Starlin interview]</ref>}}

Thanos first appears in ''Iron Man'' #55 (Feb. 1973). Under Starlin's guidance, the character quickly became a master villain and one of the main threats to Marvel Earth in the 1970s. The character made a series of appearances in a variety of titles, including ''[[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' #25 - 33 (bi-monthly: Mar. 1972 - July 1974), with [[cameo]] appearances in ''Daredevil'' #107 (Jan. 1974) and ''Avengers'' #125 (July 1974), and a one-shot story in ''[[Logan's Run]]'' #6 (June 1977), until apparently killed at the conclusion of a storyline in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Annual #7 and ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' Annual #2 (also both 1977).

Starlin resurrected Thanos in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990). He followed this with a two-issue [[limited series|mini-series]], ''[[Thanos Quest]]'' (1990), and then a series of annual company-wide crossovers featuring Thanos, anchored by the [[limited series]] ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (Jul. - Dec. 1991); ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1-6 (Jun. - Nov. 1992); and the ''[[Infinity Crusade]]'' #1-6 (Mar. - Nov. 1993). Thanos also made appearances as a supporting character in issues of the [[ongoing series]] ''[[Adam Warlock|Warlock and the Infinity Watch]]'' (1992-1995).

The following decade, Starlin featured Thanos in another limited series, ''[[Infinity Abyss]]'' #1 -6 (Aug.- Oct. 2002, with issues published biweekly), followed by ''[[Marvel: The End]]'' #1 - 6 (May - Jul. 2003, with most issues published biweekly). That year, Thanos debuted in an ongoing, self-titled series initially written and [[penciller|penciled]] by Starlin, with writer [[Keith Giffen]] and penciller [[Ron Lim]] taking over with issue #7. The series ran for 12 issues (Dec. 2003 - Sep. 2004).

==Fictional character biography==
Thanos is born on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], a moon of the planet [[Saturn]] to [[Mentor (Marvel Comics)#A'lars|Mentor]] and [[Sui-San]]. Due to a genetic quirk, Thanos is born with the Deviant gene and as such resembles the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] — the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]' cousin race — more than his own people. Although treated fairly by his race, Thanos is mindful of his appearance and becomes distant, only keeping company with his brother [[Starfox (comic character)|Eros]] (Starfox). Thanos matures to adulthood, and via the use of bionics and mysticism augments his abilities to become the most powerful of the Titanian-born Eternals, and is often referred to as the '''Mad Titan'''.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #7 (1977)</ref> 

Bitter at being an outsider, Thanos becomes fascinated with [[nihilism]], embarking on his quest to "please" death, and begins by conducting a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race. Thanos' mother is thought to have died during the bombardment, but years later it is discovered that he kidnaps and then dissects her. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #67 (July 1992)</ref> He later travels to Earth, and prior to landing his vessel destroys a nearby car to prevent anyone from becoming aware of his existence. Unknown to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive — the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity [[Kronos (comics)|Chronos]] and is given a new form as [[Drax the Destroyer]] while the daughter is found by Thanos' father Mentor and is raised to become the heroine [[Moondragon]]. <ref name="Iron Man #55 Feb. 1973">''Iron Man'' #55 (Feb. 1973)</ref>

===First Thanos War===
Thanos begins his plan to conquer the galaxy; building a base on Earth and constructing a space vessel that acts as a "universal translator" for his huge army of alien mercenaries, so that they can understand each other's language. It is at this time that Mistress [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] - drawn by the level of Thanos' obsession and his now considerable power - manifests itself before Thanos, being an [[abstract entity]] and the personification of the universal concept of death. Thanos becomes determined to prove his "love" to Death for this sign of affection by destroying all life in the universe, and embarks on a quest to find the artifact the [[Cosmic Cube]]. It is at this time that Thanos finds himself opposed by the superheroes of Earth.

[[Iron Man]] and Drax storm Thanos' base and fight Thanos' minions, the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]], <ref name="Iron Man #55 Feb. 1973"/> while [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] becomes aware of Thanos courtesy of his cosmic awareness and explains the threat to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] and Moondragon while Thanos hunts for the [[Cosmic Cube]]. <ref>''Daredevil'' #107 (Jan. 1974)</ref> The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] later destroy the vessel acting as a translator for Thanos' alien mercenaries. <ref>''Avengers'' #125 (July 1974)</ref>

Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and uses his minions the [[Super-Skrull]] and the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] to try and destroy Captain Marvel, who rallies Eros, Mentor, Drax, Moondragon, and the Avengers against Thanos. Thanos uses the Cube and wills it to allow him to be part of - and therefore in control of - everything. Although Thanos is now omnipotent and easily defeats the heroes, he makes the mistake of discarding what he believes to be a now-drained Cube. Captain Marvel shatters the Cube, which undoes Thanos' wish. Thanos then discovers that Death has abandoned him as result of this defeat, and retreats. <ref>''Captain Marvel'' #25 - 33 (bi-monthly: Mar. 1972 - July 1974)</ref> [[Iron Man]] later investigates Thanos' old base and together with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] battles the Blood Brothers again. <ref>''Marvel Feature'' #12 (Nov. 1973)</ref>

Thanos journeys into deep space and learns of the [[Universal Church of Truth]], led by the being the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], a warped and future version of the hero [[Adam Warlock]]. Deciding that the Magus is a threat to his plans, and after finding the child [[Gamora]]—whose race has been exterminated by the Church—Thanos raises and trains her to assassinate the Magus. Thanos also joins forces with Adam Warlock, who is unaware of the fact that the Magus is actually the Champion of Life and that Thanos is the Champion of Death. The two eventually battle, and Thanos feigns defeat to allow Adam Warlock time to manipulate the timeline and undo the Magus. <ref>''Strange Tales'' #178 - 181 (Feb. - Aug 1975) + Warlock #9 -11 (Oct. 1975 - Jan. 1976)</ref> It is during this alliance Thanos secretly siphons off the energies of the Soul Gem that Warlock possesses for future use.

===Second Thanos War===
Thanos combines the energies from the Soul Gem with the energies of the other [[Infinity Gems]] to power a weapon capable of destroying a star. Thanos then intends to extinguish every star in the universe as a gift to Death. Gamora discovers Thanos' intentions and is killed trying to stop him, while Warlock's unsuspecting ally [[Pip the Troll]] is left in a catatonic state for him to find. Gamora lives long enough to warn a returning Adam Warlock, who travels to Earth and enlists the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and Moondragon. After attacking and disrupting Thanos' mercenary fleet, most of the Avengers and Moondragon storm ''Sanctuary I'', Thanos' vessel. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and Iron Man follow Adam Warlock and Captain Marvel, who confront Thanos directly. Captain Marvel destroys the weapon's launcher, but Thanos then kills an attacking Warlock. Thor holds off Thanos while Iron Man destroys the weapon itself, and an enraged Thanos then defeats the remaining heroes with Sanctuary I's weapons. The cosmic entities Lord Order and Master Chaos intervene, and via a subconscious message summon [[Spider-Man]] and the Thing. Spider-Man frees the fallen heroes, and then finds the Soul Gem, releasing the spirit of Adam Warlock, who subsequently turns Thanos to stone. <ref>''Avengers'' Annual #7 + ''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #2 (1977)</ref>

===Infinity===
The [[Silver Surfer]] witnesses the resurrection of Thanos by Mistress Death, who feels that Death needs a champion once again. A revived Thanos decides to collect the [[Infinity Gems]], which he takes from the [[In-Betweener]] and the [[Elders of the Universe]]. Thanos then combines the gems on his left glove to create the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], which allows him to exceed the power he once possessed with the Cosmic Cube.<ref>''The Thanos Quest'' #1 - 2 (1990)</ref>

Thanos honors Death by erasing half the population of the universe. Earth's superheroes confront and almost defeat an overconfident Thanos, who after defeating them goes on to stop an assembly of the cosmic hierarchy including [[Galactus]], the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], [[Epoch (Marvel Comics)|Epoch]], [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]], two [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], [[Lord Chaos]], [[Master Order]], [[Mistress Love]], [[Sire Hate]], and [[Mephisto]]. Even Death turns against Thanos but is also defeated. The conflict culminates in single combat with [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]. As a victorious Thanos abandons his corporeal self to assume Eternity's position, the space pirate [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], who claims to be his granddaughter, takes the Gauntlet. Nebula then reverts Thanos' changes, but then loses the Gauntlet to Adam Warlock. When confronted by the heroes, Thanos activates a nuclear device in his costume, stating that he prefers death to imprisonment. With no time to deactivate the device, Thor throws his mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] into Thanos, hurling him miles away. Thanos, however, teleports away just as the device detonates. Only Adam Warlock - in possession of the Infinity Gauntlet - is aware of the deception, and notes that Thanos now has a chance to reform. <ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 - 6 (1990)</ref> 

Thanos does reform for a time, and is eventually given the Reality Gem by Adam Warlock to safeguard. <ref>''The Infinity Watch'' #2 (1991)</ref> Thanos uses the gem to resurrect the hero Captain Marvel, who died during the time that Thanos himself was dead. Thanos seeks forgiveness for his past actions and claims he wished to test the power of the gem. Captain Marvel, however, knowing of Thanos' self-doubts, guesses the truth and suspects that he has been resurrected to try and dissuade Thanos from his real goal: using the gem to make Mistress Death love him.

Thanos confesses and at Captain Marvel's request allows him to return to the afterlife. Thanos then assists Adam Warlock and Earth's superheroes against first the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] and later the [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]]- the evil and good personas of Warlock, who expunged them to become omnipotent when possessing the Infinity Gauntlet (Although none of Earth's heroes entirely trust him after his past actions). <ref>''The Infinity War'' #1 - 6 (1992) + ''The Infinity Crusade'' #1 - 6 (June - Nov. 1993)</ref> After fighting Thor, now strengthened by the Power Gem, in single combat, Thanos uses an invention to imprison him, and takes Thor to Asgard, home of the Norse Gods. Once in Asgard Thanos, Drax, and the [[Silver Surfer]] engage Thor's father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] in battle, but are overpowered. It is at this point, however, that Odin discovers he is indirectly responsible for Thor's insanity, and aids Thor in curing himself. <ref>''Thor' #470 & 471 (Jan. - Feb 1994); ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #88 (Jan. 1994); ''Warlock Chronicles'' #8 (Feb. 1994) and ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #25 (Feb. 1994)</ref>

===New Trials===
Thanos later discovers via an oracle a new extraterrestrial threat - [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]], a failed creation of Galactus. Thanos allies himself with Galactus' former [[Herald of Galactus|Herald]] [[Terrax]], the hero [[Jack of Hearts]], a second generation [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Ganymede (comics)|Ganymede]], a warrior-priestess dedicated to destroying Tyrant.  Together they attack Tyrant's base, at which point Thanos abandons the battle and taps into Tyrant's computers to learn of his origin. Thanos then steals one of Tyrant's "power orbs" - containing power drained from Galactus' Herald [[Morg]]. Thanos then confronts the entity and dares Tyrant to stop him. The battle allows Thanos' allies to escape and destroys much of Tyrant's base, at which point Thanos teleports away to safety.<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1 - 6 (1994)</ref> 

Soon after this Thanos recovers his vessel ''Sanctuary II'' from the android [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]], and saves the Silver Surfer and Spider-Man in the process. <ref>''Spider-man Team-Up'' #2 (1996)</ref> 

Thanos is later revealed to be trapped in an alternate dimension. He employs the aid of the brother of [[Ka-Zar#Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]], [[Plunderer|Parnival Plunder]], to attempt escape, planning to control all vegetation and cause universal havoc. <ref>''Ka-Zar'' vol. 2, #4 - 10 + Annual 1997</ref> A year later Thanos is still trapped, and attempts to use the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as a physical anchor back to the [[Earth-616]] universe. He is, however, defeated by the Hulk and the mutant [[Nate Grey|X-Man]]. <ref>''X-Man and Hulk'' Annual 1998</ref> 

Thanos eventually reappears, having escaped the alternate dimension. He now seeks the Chalice of Ruins, Map of All-Ending, and Illumination Stone, which when united will enable the user to destroy the universe. Thanos enlists the aid of the Asgardian monster [[Mangog]] and the traitor Tarakis, and storms [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and ravages entire worlds hunting for the artifacts. After several bloody battles, the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defeats Mangog with the help of [[Orikal]] while his ally [[Firelord]] defeats Tarakis. Just as Thanos unites the items and realizes his goal, Thor dons Asgardian armor which allows him to match Thanos' new power levels and defeats the Titan. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #21 - 25 (Mar. - July) + ''Thor'' Annual 2000</ref>

Thanos later requires the aid of Thor and Genis (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected. Thanos and the heroes are successful, and it is revealed at this time that Thanos' retaking of his vessel and previous encounters with Ka-Zar and Thor were planned and served as useful preparation for the battle against Walker. <ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17 - 19 (Jun - Aug. 2001)</ref> Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new race of Gods created by himself.  Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers, former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], and her son Quoi, apparently destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the '''Rot''', an aberration in deep space that is apparently their offspring. <ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1 - 8 (2001 - 2002)</ref>

Thanos once conducted extensive research on genetics, and after studying many of the universe's heroes and villains cloned them and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of [[Professor X]], Iron Man, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Doctor Strange]], and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed that the incarnations of Thanos that had encountered Thor and Ka-Zar were simply clones impersonating him. The true Thanos - with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange - destroys the remaining clones. <ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' # 1 - 6 (2002)</ref>

===The End===
{{mainarticle|Marvel: The End}}
Sometime later Thanos finds and uses the artifact the [[Heart of the Universe]] to stop an alien [[pharaoh]] called [[Akhenaten (comics)|Akhenaten]] who conquers Earth. The artifact makes Thanos a part of everything, and able to absorb the entire universe - even the other cosmic entities. With his newfound omnipotence, Thanos discovers that the constant resurrection of beings has caused an impurity in the old universe that only he can fix. Thanos then restarts the universe and sacrifices himself to fix the flaw. <ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1 - 6 (2004)</ref>

===Further challenges===
A repentant Thanos apparently survives and is accompanied by Adam Warlock to New Rigel-3, where Thanos uses his power to atone for previous acts committed against the Rigelians. The grateful Rigelians ask Thanos to assist with a problem on Rigel-18, which is revealed to be Galactus. Galactus displays an aching conscience, and attempts to find and unite the Infinity Gems to stop his need to devour inhabited planets. Galactus, however, is being manipulated by an inter-dimensional parasite called Hunger, which devours entire cosmoses. The Hunger tricks Galactus into creating a machine - requiring the power of Infinity Gems - that allows Hunger access into the [[Earth-616]] universe. With assistance from Moondragon and Pip the Troll, Thanos discovers the truth and attempts to stop Galactus directly but is outmatched. As Hunger begins to enter their universe, Galactus momentarily stalls the vastly more powerful entity until it adapts to his power, and Thanos fails to destroy the portal that separates it from the majority of its being. Thanos then distracts Hunger and forces Rigel-18 to collide with another planet while detonating a large nuclear arsenal at the point of impact. Galactus is damaged but survives the explosion, and the Hunger is believed cut off from the majority of its being, although a tiny remnant of the organism that entered the universe apparently survives by attaching itself to Galactus and then fleeing. Thanos states that although Galactus' intent was "the proper thing to do", his continued consumption of inhabited worlds will eventually unite the universal population against him, including Thanos himself. <ref>''Thanos'' #1 - 6 (2003 - 2004)</ref>

Thanos then visits the [[Kyln]], an inter-galactic prison on the edge of the universe. It is here that Thanos meets the chaos mite Skreet, who chooses to accompany him, and the [[Fallen One]], the very first Herald of Galactus. The Fallen One attempts to find and destroy Galactus, but Galactus teleports him back to Thanos as he offers to handle the matter. Thanos defeats the Fallen One by tricking it to ignite a [[gas giant]], and after mind wiping him employs it as his own personal Herald. <ref>''Thanos'' #7 - 12 (2004)</ref>  

Another clone of Thanos appears at the trial of his brother Eros and claims that his brother inspired his obsession with Death when they were children, when attempting to make young Thanos accept the death of an animal he had involuntarily killed. By Titanian law Eros had to then take full responsibility for Thanos' later atrocities. This is revealed to be a false memory implanted by the true Thanos as a personal joke. <ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 4, #6 - 13 (2006)</ref>

===Annihilation===
Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain [[Annihilus]], who is employing the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] to decimate the universe. Thanos does so as he is "curious to see how a radical tilt in the universal balance would play out." Thanos also convinces Tenebrous and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]] - two of Galactus' ancient enemies - to defeat the World Devourer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus, but once Thanos learns of Annihilus' true goal (to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor) he decides to free Galactus. [[Drax the Destroyer]], however, appears and kills Thanos before he can do so. <ref>Annihilation #4 (2006)</ref> During a climactic battle with Annihilus, the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] is near death and sees Thanos - now standing with Mistress Death as her apparent consort - observing him. <ref> ''Annihilation'' #6 (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos possesses a wide range of abilities, some of which are common to the Titanian Eternals, and others that have been acquired through bionic amplification, mysticism, and augmentation by Death itself. In addition to superior levels of superhuman strength, stamina and particularly durability, Thanos has shown himself capable of absorbing and directing enormous quantities of cosmic energy, and using it to shield himself. The Titan is also capable of matter manipulation, telekinesis, and resistance to powerful telepathic assaults. Thanos can also temporarily increase his powers by absorbing energy from an unknown source of quasi-mystical nature. <ref>''Infinity War'' #6 (Nov. 1992)''</ref> 

Thanos possesses a superhuman intellect and was originally dedicated to the annihilation of life and the mastery of any technology or mysticism that would enable him to achieve this goal. He possesses technology that allows for force field projection; time travel; movement through alternate dimensions and teleportation over interstellar distances. Thanos also trained his adopted daughter [[Gamora]] to become one of the universe's most adept female assassins.

==Other versions ==
In addition to his [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation, Thanos has had been depicted in other [[fictional universes]]. Genis-Vell encounters a version of Thanos resembling Adam Warlock in an alternative dimension. <ref>''Captain Marvel'' #11 (Nov. 2000)</ref>

===Earth X===
In this alternate continuity, Thanos dwells in the Realm of the Dead with Death. <ref>''Universe X'' # 1 - 12 (Oct. 2000 - Sep. 2001)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the Earth-2149 universe, Thanos is shown to have been "zombified" and one of those beings that eat many of the sentient beings in the universe. He is killed by the [[Alternate versions of Hulk#Marvel Zombies|Hulk]] after an altercation over food. <ref>''Marvel Zombies'' 2 #1 (Oct. 2007)</ref>

===Ultimate Fantastic Four===
Thanos is the ruler of Acheron, a vast empire consisting of thousands of worlds that exists on another plane of existence. He has two sons: Gallowglass - whose body is composed of star matter - and an alternate version of [[Ronan the Accuser]], who is loyal to Thanos and his empire, as opposed to the [[Kree]] in the [[Earth-616]] universe. He also has a daughter, Atrea, who was punished for her rebellious nature by having her arm "skeletonized". <ref>Thanos first seen in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #47 (Oct. 2007)</ref>
