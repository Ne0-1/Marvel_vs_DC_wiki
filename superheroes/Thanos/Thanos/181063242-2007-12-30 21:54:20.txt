'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[extraterrestrial]] [[supervillain]] and [[anti-hero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character's name is a derivation of [[Thanatos]], the god of death in [[Greek mythology]]. Thanos was created by [[Jim Starlin]] and first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973)

==Publication history==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived Thanos during college [[psychology]] classes. As Starlin described:
{{cquote|I went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psyche class and I came up with Thanos ... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I’m not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] Roy [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do a issue of ''Iron Man''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches ... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm Adelaide Comics and Books: Jim Starlin interview]</ref>}}

Thanos' [[first appearance]] is in ''Iron Man'' #55 (Feb. 1973). Under Starlin's guidance, the character quickly became a master villain and one of the main threats to Marvel Earth in the 1970s. The character appeared in such titles ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' until being apparently killed at the climax of ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]] Annual'' #2 (1977).

Starlin resurrected Thanos in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990). He followed this with a two-issue [[miniseries]], ''[[Thanos Quest]]'' (1990), and then a series of annual company-wide crossovers featuring Thanos, anchored by the miniseries ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991); ''[[Infinity War]]'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1992); and the ''[[Infinity Crusade]]'' #1-6 (March-Nov. 1993). Thanos also made appearances as a supporting character in issues of the ongoing series ''[[Adam Warlock|Warlock and the Infinity Watch]]'' (1992-1995).

The following decade, Starlin featured Thanos in another miniseries, ''[[Infinity Abyss]]'' #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002, with issues published biweekly), followed by ''[[Marvel: The End]]'' #1-6 (May-July 2003, with most issues published biweekly). That year, Thanos debuted in an ongoing, self-titled series initially written and [[penciller|penciled]] by Starlin, with writer [[Keith Giffen]] and penciller [[Ron Lim]] taking over with issue #7. The series ran 12 issues (Dec. 2003 - Sept. 2004).

==Fictional character biography==
===Childhood===
Thanos is born on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], a moon of the planet [[Saturn]] to [[Mentor (Marvel Comics)#A'lars|Mentor]] and [[Sui-San]]. Due to a genetic quirk, Thanos is born with the Deviant gene and as such resembles the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] — the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]' cousin race — more than his own people. Although treated fairly by his race, Thanos is mindful of his appearance and becomes distant, only keeping company with his brother [[Starfox (comic character)|Eros]]. Thanos matures to adulthood, and via the use of bionics and mysticism augments his abilities to easily become the most powerful of the Titanian-born Eternals, and is often referred to as the '''Mad Titan'''.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers Annual]]'' #7</ref> 

Bitter at being an outsider, Thanos is driven insane and becomes fascinated with [[nihilism]], embarking on his quest to "please" death, and begins by conducting a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race. 
Thanos' mother is thought to have died during the bombardment, but years later it is discovered that he kidnaps and then dissects her.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #67</ref> He later travels to Earth, and prior to landing his vessel destroys a nearby car to prevent anyone from becoming aware of his existence. Unknown to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive—the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity [[Kronos (comics)|Chronos]] and is given a new form as [[Drax the Destroyer]] while the daughter is found by Thanos' father Mentor and is raised to become [[Moondragon]]. <ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #55</ref>

===The First Thanos War===
Many years later, Thanos begins his plan to conquer the galaxy; he builds a base on Earth and constructs a space vessel in the solar system that acts as a "universal translator" for his huge army of alien mercenaries, so that they can understand each other's language. It is at this time that Mistress [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] - drawn by the level of Thanos' obsession and his now considerable power - manifests itself before Thanos, being an abstract entity and the personification of the universal concept of death. Thanos becomes determined to prove his "love" to Death for this sign of affection by destroying all life in the universe, and embarks on a quest to find the artifact the [[Cosmic Cube]]. It is at this time that Thanos finds himself opposed by the superheroes of Earth, who initially fight Thanos' forces in a rather disjointed fashion:

* [[Iron Man]] and Drax storm Thanos' base and fight Thanos' minions, the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]].<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #55</ref> 

* [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] becomes aware of Thanos courtesy of his cosmic awareness and explains the threat to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], and Moondragon while Thanos hunts for the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1, #107</ref>

* The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] destroy the vessel acting as a translator for Thanos' mercenaries.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #125</ref>

Thanos eventually locates the Cube,<ref>Thanos is seen hunting for the Cube in ''Daredevil'' vol. 1, #107 and locates it in ''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1, #28</ref> and uses his minions the [[Super-Skrull]] and the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] to try and destroy Captain Marvel, who rallies Eros, Mentor, Drax, Moondragon, and the Avengers against Thanos. Thanos uses the Cube and wills it to allow him to be part of - and therefore in control of - everything. Although Thanos is now omnipotent and easily defeats the heroes, he makes the mistake of discarding what he believes to be a now-drained Cube. Captain Marvel shatters the Cube, which undoes Thanos' wish. Thanos then discovers that Death has abandoned him as result of this defeat, and retreats.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1, #25 - 33</ref> [[Iron Man]] later investigates Thanos' old base and together with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] battles the Blood Brothers again.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #12</ref>

Thanos journeys into deep space and learns of the [[Universal Church of Truth]], led by the being the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], a warped and future version of the hero [[Adam Warlock]]. Deciding that the Magus is a threat to his plans, and after finding the child [[Gamora]]—whose race has been exterminated by the Church—Thanos raises and trains her to assassinate the Magus. Thanos also joins forces with Adam Warlock, who is unaware of the fact that the Magus is actually the Champion of Life and that Thanos is the Champion of Death. The two eventually battle, and Thanos feigns defeat to allow Adam Warlock time to manipulate the timeline and undo the Magus.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1, #178 - 181 + Warlock #9 -11</ref> It is during this alliance Thanos secretly siphons off the energies of the Soul Gem that Warlock possesses, and after leaving Adam Warlock, Thanos embarks on his next quest to appease Death.

===The Second Thanos War===
Thanos combines the energies from the Soul Gem with the energies of the other [[Infinity Gems]] to power a weapon that is capable of destroying a star. Thanos then plans to painstakingly snuff out every star in the universe as a gift to Death. Gamora discovers Thanos' intentions and attempts to kill him, but is mortally wounded herself. Adam Warlock's unsuspecting ally [[Pip the Troll]] is also killed.

Gamora lives long enough to warn a returning Adam Warlock, who travels to Earth and enlists the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and Moondragon. After attacking and dealing with Thanos' mercenary fleet, most of the Avengers and Moondragon storm ''Sanctuary I'', Thanos' vessel. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and Iron Man follow Adam Warlock and Captain Marvel, who confront Thanos directly. Captain Marvel destroys the weapon's launcher, but Thanos then kills an attacking Warlock. Thor holds off Thanos while Iron Man destroys the weapon itself, and an enraged Thanos then defeats the remaining heroes. The cosmic entities Lord Order and Master Chaos intervene, and via a subconscious message draw [[Spider-Man]] and the Thing into the battle. Spider-Man frees the fallen heroes, and then makes contact with the Soul Gem, releasing the spirit of Adam Warlock, who then turns Thanos to stone.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #7 + ''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #2 (1977)</ref>
===Infinity===
Years later, the [[Silver Surfer]] witnesses the resurrection of Thanos by Mistress Death, who feels that Death needs a champion once again. A revived Thanos decides to collect the [[Infinity Gems]], which he takes from the [[In-Betweener]] and the [[Elders of the Universe]]. Thanos then combines the gems on his left glove to create the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], which allows him to exceed the power he once possessed with the Cosmic Cube.<ref>''The Thanos Quest'' #1 - 2 (1990)</ref>
[[Image:Infinity Gauntlet 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thanos wearing the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]. ''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 (July 1991).<br>Art by [[George Pérez]].]]

Thanos honors Death by erasing half the population of the universe, and then goes on to defeat the entire cosmic hierarchy (e.g., [[Galactus]], the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]]) as Death watches. A group of Earth's superheroes almost defeat an overconfident Thanos, who then loses the Gauntlet to the space pirate [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], who claims to be his granddaughter. Nebula then undoes all of Thanos' changes, only to then lose the Gauntlet shortly after to Adam Warlock. Thanos realizes that it was his own self-doubt that allowed for his defeat, and when confronted by the superheroes he activates a nuclear device in his costume, telling them he prefers death to imprisonment. With no time to deactivate the device, Thor throws his hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] into Thanos, hurling him miles away. Thanos, however, teleports away just as the device detonates. Only Adam Warlock - in possession of the Infinity Gauntlet - is aware of the deception, and notes that Thanos now has a chance to reform.<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 - 6 (1990)</ref>

Thanos does reform for a time, and is eventually given the Reality Gem by Adam Warlock to safeguard. <ref>''The Infinity Watch'' #2 (1991)</ref> At one point Thanos uses the gem to resurrect the hero Captain Marvel, who died during the time that Thanos himself was dead. Thanos seeks forgiveness for his past actions and claims he wished to test the power of the gem. Captain Marvel, however, knowing of Thanos' self-doubts, guesses the truth and suspects that he has been resurrected to try and dissuade Thanos from his real goal: using the gem to make Mistress Death love him. 

Thanos confesses and at Captain Marvel's request allows him to return to the afterlife. Thanos then assists Adam Warlock and Earth's superheroes against first the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] and later the [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]] - the evil and good personas of Warlock, who expunged them to become omnipotent when possessing the Infinity Gauntlet.<ref>''The Infinity War'' #1 - 6 (1992) + ''The Infinity Crusade'' #1 - 6</ref> Soon after helping to defeat the Goddess, Thanos battles the Thunder God Thor, who was driven insane during the war. After stalemating Thor - now empowered with the Power Gem - Thanos manages to imprison him and takes Thor to Asgard, home of the Norse Gods. Once in Asgard Thanos battles Thor's father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], who eventually overpowers him. It is at this point, however, that Odin discovers he is indirectly responsible for Thor's insanity, and aids Thor in curing himself.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #470; ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #88; ''Warlock Chronicles'' #8; ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' vol. 1, #25 and ''Thor'' vol. 1, #471</ref>

===New Trials===
Thanos later discovers via an oracle a new extraterrestrial threat - [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]], a failed creation of Galactus. Thanos allies himself with Galactus' former [[Herald of Galactus|Herald]] [[Terrax]], the hero [[Jack of Hearts]], a second generation [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Ganymede (comics)|Ganymede]], a warrior-priestess dedicated to destroying Tyrant.  Together they attack Tyrant's base, at which point Thanos abandons the battle and taps into Tyrant's computers to learn of his origin. Stealing an orb containing power drained from Galactus' Herald [[Morg]] by Tyrant, Thanos confronts the entity and dares Tyrant to stop him. The battle allows Thanos' allies to escape and destroys much of Tyrant's base, at which point Thanos teleports away to safety. Tyrant is then confronted by Galactus, who negotiates the terms of a truce (including the release of other prisoners the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], and [[Beta Ray Bill]]) and later orchestrates Tyrant's destruction.<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1 - 6 (1994)</ref> 

Soon after this Thanos recovers his vessel ''Sanctuary II'' from the android [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]], and saves the Silver Surfer and Spider-Man in the process.<ref>''Spider-man Team-Up'' #2 (1996)</ref> Some years later, Thanos is revealed to be trapped in an alternate dimension. He employs the aid of the brother of [[Ka-Zar#Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]], [[Plunderer|Parnival Plunder]], to try and escape, but finds that nearly unlimited power is in the dimension itself.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' vol. 2, #4 - 10 + Annual 1997</ref> A year later Thanos is still trapped, and attempts to use the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as a physical link back to the [[Earth-616]] universe. However, he is stopped by the Hulk and the mutant [[Nate Grey|X-Man]].<ref>''X-man and Hulk'' Annual 1998</ref> 

Thanos reappears two years later, having apparently escaped the alternate dimension. He now seeks the Chalice of Ruins, Map of All-Ending, and Illumination Stone, which when united will enable the user to destroy the universe. Thanos enlists the aid of the Asgardian monster [[Mangog]] and the traitor Tarakis, and storms [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and ravages entire worlds hunting for the artifacts. After several pursuits and bloody battles, the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defeats Mangog with the help of [[Orikal]] while his ally [[Firelord]] defeats Tarakis. Just as Thanos unites the items and realizes his goal, Thor dons specially-made Asgardian armor which allows him to match Thanos' new power levels and defeats the Titan. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #21 - 25 + ''Thor'' Annual 2000</ref>

Ironically, Thanos later requires the aid of Thor and Genis (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected. Thanos and the heroes are successful, and it is revealed at this time that Thanos' retaking of his vessel and previous encounters with Ka-Zar and Thor were planned and served as useful preparation for the battle against Walker.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17 - 19</ref> Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new race of Gods created by himself.  Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers, former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], and her son Quoi, apparently destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the Rot, an aberration in deep space that is apparently their offspring. <ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1 - 8 (2001 - 2002)</ref>

Soon afterwards it is revealed that many years ago Thanos conducted extensive research on genetics, and after studying many of the universe's heroes and villains cloned them and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Thanos later abandons the project, unaware that five clones survive, being versions of [[Professor X]], Iron Man, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Doctor Strange]], and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed that many of Thanos' recent encounters with Earth's superheroes (e.g., Silver Surfer, Spider-Man, Ka-Zar, and Thor) were simply clones impersonating him. The true Thanos, however, returns and with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange destroy the remaining clones.<ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' # 1 - 6 (2002)</ref>

===Further challenges===
A repentant Thanos apparently survives and is accompanied by Adam Warlock to New Rigel-3, where Thanos uses his power to atone for previous acts committed against the Rigelians.  The grateful Rigelians ask Thanos to assist with a problem on Rigel-18, which is revealed to be Galactus. Galactus is attempting to unite and use the Infinity Gems to stop his need to devour planets.  Galactus, however, is being manipulated by an inter-dimensional parasite called Hunger, who tricks Galactus into creating a machine - requiring the power of Infinity Gems - that allows Hunger access into the [[Earth-616]] universe. With assistance from Moondragon and Pip the Troll, Thanos discovers the truth and attempts to stop Galactus but is easily outmatched. Hunger emerges just as Thanos closes the portal the machine has created, and as Galactus battles the entity, Thanos forces Rigel-18 to collide with another planet and also detonates a large nuclear arsenal at the point of impact. Galactus survives the explosion and Hunger is believed destroyed, although a tiny remnant of Hunger apparently survives by attaching itself to Galactus and then fleeing. Galactus is not grateful - and warns Thanos about the consequences of meddling in his affairs. <ref>''Thanos'' #1 - 6 (2003 - 2004)</ref>

Thanos then visits the [[Kyln]], an inter-galactic prison on the edge of the universe. It is here that Thanos meets the chaos mite Skreet, who chooses to accompany him, and the [[Fallen One]], the very first Herald of Galactus. The Fallen One attempts to find and destroy Galactus, but Galactus simply teleports him back to Thanos. Thanos defeats the Fallen One, and after mind wiping him employs the cosmic entity as his own personal Herald.<ref>''Thanos'' #7 - 12 (2004)</ref>

===Annihilation===
[[Image:Thanosdeath.PNG|right|200px|thumb|Thanos with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]] in ''Annihilation'' #6 (2007). <br>Art by [[Andrea Di Vito]].]]
Thanos recently aligned himself with the villain [[Annihilus]], who is employing the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] to decimate the universe. Thanos does so as he is "curious to see how a radical tilt in the universal balance would play out." Thanos also convinces Tenebrous and Aegis - two of Galactus' ancient enemies - to defeat the World Devourer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus, but once Thanos learns of Annihilus' true goal (to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor) he decides to free Galactus.

[[Drax the Destroyer]], however, appears and kills Thanos before he can do so. <ref>Annihilation #4 (2006)</ref> During a climactic battle with Annihilus, the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] is near death and sees Thanos - now standing with Mistress Death as her apparent consort - observing him. <ref> ''Annihilation'' #6 (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos possesses a wide range of abilities, some of which are common to the Titanian Eternals, and others that have been acquired through bionic amplification, mysticism, and augmentation by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself. In addition to vast levels of superhuman strength, stamina, and durability, Thanos is capable of energy and matter manipulation, teleportation, and telepathy. Even though Thanos typically prefers to avoid physical confrontation, preferring to outwit his enemies, he is a formidable combatant. He is particularly adept in using a combination of his physical and energy-manipulating abilities in these situations. Thanos can also temporarily increase his powers by absorbing energy from an unknown source of quasi-mystical nature.<ref>''Infinity War #6 (1992)'' </ref> <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #470; ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #88; ''Warlock Chronicles'' #8; ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' vol. 1, #25 and ''Thor'' vol. 1, #471</ref> 

Thanos possesses a superhuman intellect that is almost obsessively dedicated to the annihilation of life and the mastery of any technology or mysticism that will enable him to achieve this goal. Thanos is a superb tactician and is well-versed in many areas of arcane lore. He possesses technology that allows him to time-travel and travel through alternate dimensions, and teleport over vast distances. Thanos also trained his adopted daughter [[Gamora]] to become one of the universe's most adept and feared female assassins.

==Other versions ==
===Alternative Dimension===
Genis-Vell encounters a version of Thanos resembling Adam Warlock in an alternative dimension. <ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol.3 #11</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the Earth-2149 universe, as revealed in one of the multiple ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' limited series, Thanos is shown to have been "zombified" and one of those beings that eat many of the sentient beings in the universe. He is killed by the [[Alternate versions of Hulk#Marvel Zombies|Hulk]] shortly after getting into an altercation over food. <ref>''Marvel Zombies'' 2 #1 (2007)''Marvel Zombies'' 2 #1 (2007)</ref>

===The End===
{{mainarticle|Marvel: The End}}
Sometime later Thanos finds and uses the artifact the [[Heart of the Universe]] to stop an alien [[pharaoh]] called [[Akhenaten (comics)|Akhenaten]] who conquers Earth. The artifact makes Thanos a part of everything, and able to absorb the entire universe - even the cosmic entities Eternity, [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]], and the [[Living Tribunal]]. With his newfound omnipotence, Thanos discovers that the constant resurrection of beings has caused an impurity in the old universe that only he can fix. Thanos then restarts the universe and sacrifices himself to fix the flaw.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1 - 6 (2004)</ref>

===Ultimate Thanos===
The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Thanos is the ruler of Acheron, a vast empire consisting of thousands of worlds that exists on another plane of existence. He has two sons: Gallowglass - whose body is composed of star matter - and [[Ronan the Accuser]], a principal figure in the Kree Empire in the Earth-616 universe.
