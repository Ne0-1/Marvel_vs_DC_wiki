'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s and other [[Mass media|media]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and was created by writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]].

Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of comic books]], the character has featured in over three decades of Marvel continuity and a self-titled series.   The character's name is a derivation of [[Thanatos]], the personification of death and mortality in [[Greek mythology]].  {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  One of his more prominent storylines to date - the [[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]] series - portrayed him as a mad [[wikt:Special:Search/cosmic|cosmic]] tyrant bent on slaying half of all [[sentience]]s existing then in Marvel's [[multiverse]] in order to appease the [[Marvel Universe]]'s actual (and more powerful) embodied personification of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] in an attempt to win its [[love]].

Thanos has consistently recurred as a powerful [[villain]], and has been featured across nearly Marvel's entire product line, including [[Animation|animated]] [[television series]]; [[Arcade game|arcade]] and [[video games]]; [[toy]]s and [[trading cards]].

== Character and publication history ==
=== Origin ===
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived Thanos of Titan during college [[psychology]] classes. As Starlin described:

{{cquote|I went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos ... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] Roy [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''Iron Man''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches ... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm Adelaide Comics and Books: Jim Starlin interview]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>}}

Although there are parallels with [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]], Starlin has said this was not quite the case:

{{cquote|Kirby had done the [[New Gods]], which I thought was terrific. He was over at DC at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said : "Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!"<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #266 |work=Comics Should Be Good |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}</ref> }}

The [[origin story]] of Thanos relates that he was born on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], a moon of the planet [[Saturn]], to [[A'lars|Mentor]] and [[Sui-San]]. Due to a genetic quirk, Thanos is born with the Deviant gene and as such resembles the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] — the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]' cousin race — more than his own people. Although treated fairly by his race, Thanos is mindful of his appearance and becomes distant, only keeping company with his brother [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]] (Starfox). Thanos matures to adulthood, and via the use of bionics and mysticism augments his abilities to become the most powerful of the Titanian-born Eternals, and is often referred to as the '''Mad Titan'''.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #7 (1977)</ref> Writer Starlin added another player to convey the gravity of Thanos' threat: Death itself, in the form of "Mistress" [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] is drawn by the level of the character's obsession. Bitter at being an outsider, Thanos becomes fascinated with [[nihilism]] and a worshipper of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], embarking on his quest to "please" death, and begins by conducting a nuclear bombardment of [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]] that kills millions of his race <ref>''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #67 (July 1992)</ref> The character travels to Earth, and prior to landing his vessel destroys a nearby car to prevent anyone from becoming aware of his existence. Unknown to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive — the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity [[Kronos (comics)|Chronos]] and is given a new form as [[Drax the Destroyer]] while the daughter is found by Thanos' father Mentor and is raised to become the heroine [[Moondragon]].

===Development===
The character first appears in ''Iron Man'' #55 (Feb. 1973), and is established as a "cosmic villain". Thanos forms a plan that spans multiple titles, including ''[[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' #25–33 (bi-monthly: Mar. 1972 - July 1974), with [[cameo appearance]]s in ''Daredevil'' #107 (Jan. 1974) and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #125 (July 1974) and a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] story in ''[[Logan's Run (comics)|Logan's Run]]'' #6 (June 1977). Wishing to conquer the [[galaxy]], the character builds a base on Earth, constructs a space vessel that acts as a "universal translator" for his huge army of alien mercenaries, and begins an obsessive quest for an item called the [[Cosmic Cube]], which can make wishes a reality. Thanos eventually locates the Cube and wills it to make him omnipotent, and easily defeats Earth's heroes, but makes the mistake of discarding what he believes to be a now-drained Cube. Captain Marvel shatters the Cube, which undoes Thanos' wish. Thanos then discovers that Death has abandoned him as result of his defeat, and retreats.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #33 (July 1974)</ref>

Thanos reappears to join forces with the hero [[Adam Warlock]] and defeat the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], a warped and future version of the hero [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #178–181 (Feb. - Aug 1975) + Warlock #9 -11 (Oct. 1975 - Jan. 1976)</ref> It is during this alliance Thanos secretly siphons off the energies of the Soul Gem that Warlock possesses for future use.<ref>Mentioned in ''Avengers'' Annual #7 (1977)</ref> Thanos combines the energies from the Soul Gem with the energies of the other [[Infinity Gems]] to power a weapon capable of destroying a star. Thanos battles Earth's superheroes and kills Adam Warlock. The story arc ends with the Soul Gem, releasing the spirit of Adam Warlock, whose spirit subsequently turns Thanos's body to stone.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #7 + ''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #2 (1977)</ref> Thanos's spirit appears to accompany Captain Marvel's soul into the realm of Death.<ref>''Death of Captain Marvel'' Graphic Novel</ref>

Starlin resurrected Thanos in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990). The revived Thanos decides to collect the [[Infinity Gems]], in a two-issue [[limited series|miniseries]], ''[[The Thanos Quest]]'' (1990), which he takes from the [[In-Betweener]] and the [[Elders of the Universe]]. Thanos then combines the gems on his left glove to create the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]], which makes him omnipotent and allows him to exceed the power he once possessed with the Cosmic Cube.<ref>''The Thanos Quest'' #1 - 2 (1990)</ref> It is followed by a series of annual company-wide crossovers featuring Thanos, anchored by the [[limited series]] ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'', in which Thanos erases half the population of the universe, hoping to win the heart of Death. Earth's superheroes and cosmic entities confront him but Thanos easily defeats them. The conflict is resolved when Thanos loses the Gauntlet to Adam Warlock, and the villain escapes by faking his own death.<ref>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 - 6 (Jul. - Dec. 1991)</ref>

[[Image:Infinity Gauntlet 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thanos wearing the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] on the cover of the ''Infinity Gauntlet'' collected edition (Aug, 1992).<br>Art by [[George Pérez]].]]

Warlock eventually divides up the Infinity Gems and creates the Infinity Watch to guard them. Thanos is entrusted by Warlock with the reality gem in secret, with even the other members of the Watch not knowing who their sixth member is. Thanos then assists Adam Warlock and Earth's superheroes against the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] and the [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]] — the evil and good personas of Warlock, who expunged them to become omnipotent when possessing the Infinity Gauntlet.<ref>''The Infinity War'' #1 - 6 (1992) + ''The Infinity Crusade'' #1 - 6 (June - Nov. 1993)</ref>

After fighting Thor, now strengthened by the Power Gem, in single combat, Thanos uses an invention to imprison him, and takes Thor to Asgard, home of the Norse Gods. Once in Asgard Thanos, Drax, and the [[Silver Surfer]] engage Thor's father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] in battle, but are overpowered. Odin discovers he is indirectly responsible for Thor's insanity, and aids Thor in curing himself.<ref>''Thor' #470 & 471 (Jan. - Feb 1994); ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #88 (Jan. 1994); ''Warlock Chronicles'' #8 (Feb. 1994) and ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #25 (Feb. 1994)</ref>

Thanos next recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of Geatar (who usually serves as consort to Thanos's grand-daughter Nebula) in a mission to extract a robot containing the knowledge of a universal library. Thanos afterwards battles a new extraterrestrial threat — [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]], a failed creation of Galactus.,<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (1994)</ref> whom he learns of from the library robot's database.

Thanos is revealed to be trapped in an alternate dimension and employs the aid of the brother of [[Ka-Zar#Kevin Plunder|Ka-Zar]], [[Plunderer|Parnival Plunder]], to attempt escape, planning to control all vegetation and cause universal havoc.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' vol. 2, #4–10 + Annual 1997</ref> A year later Thanos is still trapped, and attempts to use the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as a physical anchor back to the [[Earth-616]] universe but is defeated by the Hulk and the mutant [[Nate Grey|X-Man]].<ref>''X-Man and Hulk'' Annual 1998</ref> Thanos eventually reappears, having escaped the alternate dimension, and seeking the Chalice of Ruins, Map of All-Ending, and Illumination Stone, which when united will enable the user to destroy the universe. Thanos enlists the aid of the Asgardian monster [[Mangog]] and the traitor Tarakis, and storms [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and ravages entire worlds hunting for the artifacts. Just as Thanos unites the items and realizes his goal, Thor dons Asgardian armor which allows him to match Thanos' new power levels and defeats the Titan.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #21–25 (Mar. - July) + ''Thor'' Annual 2000</ref>

Thanos then uses the heroes Thor and [[Genis-Vell]] (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17–19 (Jun - Aug. 2001)</ref> Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new race of Gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers, former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], and her son Quoi, apparently destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the '''Rot''', an aberration in deep space that is apparently their offspring.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1–8 (2001–2002)</ref> Thanos once conducted extensive research on genetics, and after studying many of the universe's heroes and villains cloned them and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of [[Professor X]], Iron Man, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Doctor Strange]], and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered by Thor and Ka-Zar were his clones. The true Thanos — with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange — destroys the remaining clones.<ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' # 1–6 (2002)</ref>

Thanos next decides to atone for some of his deeds in the Thor-Mangog affair, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his universal hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated by a cosmic threat known as Hunger, which feeds on entire universes, into freeing it. Thanos unsuccessfully battles Galactus in an effort to stop him from the entity, but when Hunger emerges the two team up to defeat it.<ref>''Thanos'' 1-6</ref>

Thanos next journeys to the Kyln, an intergalactic prison at the site of the Crunch—described as the place where the Big Bang formed the universe. On his way there he meets Death—this time in the form of a female child, who for the first time in their long history agrees to speak directly with Thanos and tells him she is worth his efforts to woo but that he must offer her something other than death (such as he had the two times he possessed the Infinity Gems) as she has all the death she needs. At the Kyln he meets Star Lord and the Shi'ar warrior Gladiator. He then encounters the Beyonder, now using the alias the Maker, who has been rendered amnesiac by his/her choice to assume a mortal female form. Thanos alludes to an undefined prior history with the Beyonder (all the more odd since Thanos was dead during any of the prior storylines in which the Beyonder was active in the Marvel Universe). Thanos battles the Beyonder and causes her mind to shut down leaving her power trapped within a comatose mortal body, which he instructs the Kyln officers to keep on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the Beyonder from once again being reborn.<ref>''Thanos'' 7-9</ref>

Thanos then departs the Kyln in the company of a chaos-mite named Skreet that he frees from the prison in a quest to seek the Fallen—an entity he learned of from Star Lord—whom was the previously unknown first herald of Galactus and whom was eventually exiled by Galactus after he became genocidal. Thanos resurrects the entity who promptly seeks revenge on Galactus, however Galactus allows Thanos to deal with his ex-herald and Thanos eventually defeats the Fallen and places him under his complete mental control as his own herald.<ref>''Thanos'' 10-12</ref>

Thanos has a pivotal role in the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] storyline, where he allies himself with the genocidal villain [[Annihilus]]. His involvement begins when Death advises him that Annihilus plans "something wonderful" for the universe and bids him to seek him out. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters Tenebrous and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]] — two of [[Galactus]]' ancient enemies who recognize Galactus's mark on the former herald. Thanos then recovers his herald and in the process convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus, but once Thanos learns of Annihilus' true goal (to use the [[Power Cosmic]] to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor) he decides to free Galactus. [[Drax the Destroyer]], however, appears and kills Thanos before he can do so.<ref>''Annihilation'' #4 (2006)</ref> During a climactic battle with Annihilus, the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] is near death and sees Thanos — now standing with Mistress Death as her apparent consort — observing him.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (2007)</ref>

===Return/"The Thanos Imperative"===
{{Main|The Thanos Imperative}}
In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #24, a mysterious cocoon found in the [[Universal Church of Truth]]'s headquarters, is revealed to be hiding Thanos, who has also apparently been chosen by Oblivion to be the new Avatar of Death, apparently killing Martyr upon hatching.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #24</ref> His rage across the Church's homeworld kills all but the fleeing remaining Guardian members, who re-unite with their teammates. Thanos was resurrected before his mind could be fully formed, leaving him a rampaging mindless brute, angry about being separated from his love, Death. The Guardians are only saved when Peter Quill uses a nearly exhausted Cosmic Cube to put Thanos to sleep, stopping his rampage, at least for the time being, saying before losing consciousness "You forced me to live again. For that, everything dies."<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #25</ref> His return also is a prelude to the major "Marvel Cosmic" limited series, "[[The Thanos Imperative]]", beginning in May 2010 and written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Beard |url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.11310.exclusive~colon~_the_thanos_imperative |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Thanos Imperative |publisher=[[Marvel.com]] |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=McGloin, Matt & Brewer, Byron |url=http://cosmicbooknews.com/articles/dnat_int/ |title=DnA Crank Things Up: The Thanos Imperative: Ignition |publisher=Cosmic Book News |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2010 }}</ref> Thanos ends up as the Guardians' only hope, and Star Lord decides to release him and let him help.<ref>''Thanos Imperative'' #1</ref> In the Cancerverse, Thanos discovers that only he can slay the undying creatures that dwell there.<ref>''Thanos Imperative'' #2</ref> He and the Guardians later join with the Robot Resistance on Titan and learn the orgin of the Cancerverse and circumstances of a dying Captain Marvell's metamorphosis.

Thanos engages him in battle and, after gaining the upper hand, unexpectedly surrenders and swears his allegiance to Mar-Vell in return for granting him death.<ref>''Thanos Imperative'' #5</ref>  Lord Mar-Vell begins the Necropsy Rite by impaling Thanos with a ceremonial sword.  Thanos' betrayal is revealed to be a ruse, its purpose being to allow Death to gain entry into the Cancerverse.  Death immediately kills Mar-Vell, which causes the Cancerverse to begin to violently self destruct.  Thanos then becomes infuriated when Death apparently abandons him again.  Knowing what his rage could mean for their universe, Star Lord and Nova decide to sacrifice themselves by engaging Thanos with the purpose of keeping him in the Cancerverse long enough to allow it to collapse and seal Thanos within it.<ref>''Thanos Imperative'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] member of the race of superhumans known as the [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titanian]] Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but in some cases far beyond any other known member of his race; acquired through a combination of his mutant Eternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and the entity Death. He has demonstrated enormous superhuman strength, stamina, and particularly durability; is able to absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy; is virtually ageless and immortal; does not need food, drink, or oxygen; and is capable of certain [[telekinesis]], as well as telepathy and matter manipulation. The advanced technology within his transportation chairs includes [[force field]] projection, [[time travel]], movement through [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s, space flight, and [[teleportation]] over interstellar distances. Thanos is an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.

Thanos is extremely intelligent (he considers his mind his greatest weapon) and possesses knowledge of Celestial and other alien technology. He is also a master strategist and sometimes utilizes a space vessel called ''Sanctuary II'' as a base of operations.

Thanos uses the power to fix any damage done by the pharaoh (which had included the deaths of most of Earth's major hero teams such as the X-Men, Avengers and Fantastic Four) and then once again gives up his physical form to take control of the universe. Adam Warlock convinces Thanos to voluntarily relinquish the power, but as a result of its origins with the dawn and end of time, Thanos emerges having experienced the entire history of the universe and claims he will no longer seek universal conquest.<ref>"Marvel : The End" 1-6</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Thanos features in the [[animated]] [[television series]] ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' voiced by [[Gary Krawford]]. Owing to the [[Fox TV network]]'s broadcast standards,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Thanos is depicted as a worshipper of a female personification of [[chaos]] rather than death.
* Thanos is featured in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in Season One and by [[Jim Cummings]] in Season Two. In "If This Be My Thanos," he appears before [[Doctor Doom]] offering the Infinity Gems if he can help him obtain a specific item from the Baxter Building. He alongside Doctor Doom, [[MODOK]], [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and [[Trapster]] attack the Baxter Building while the Super Hero Squad and the Fantastic Four were busy fighting the [[Skrull]]s. When the Super Hero Squad and the Fantastic Four returned to help [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]], the Skrull ship arrived and started to beam up Thanos. It turned out that the Thanos that Doctor Doom was helping was actually a Skrull Con-Man in disguise. In "This Al Dente Earth," the real Thanos was seen when Iron Man was thrown on the window sill of his spaceship and then wiped off. Thanos has been confirmed to be the primary villain in Season Two as he will seek the six Infinity Gems in order to prove his superiority to Nebula and gain supremacy over the universe. In the two-part episode "Another Order of Evil," he finds the Infinity Gauntlet when Captain Marvel arrives on his way to a peace conference between the Kree and the Skrull. Thanos ends up using the Soul Gem to suck Captain Marvel into it. He then plots to use the Soul Gem to cause the Kree and the Skrull to fight each other. He then tried to do the same to the Super Hero Squad only to be stopped by Scarlet Witch (who also manages to free Captain Marvel from the Soul Gem). In the episode "World War Witch," Thanos obtains the Time Gem and tries to send the Space Helicarrier to another time only for Scarlet Witch to end up sent to the World War II era.

===Video games===
* Thanos appears as the main antagonist in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' and ''[[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems|War of the Gems]]'', but he is playable in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]''.
* Thanos is briefly mentioned in the future part of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. When it comes to freeing Odin from his dark magic machine confinement in Castle Doom, Uatu mentions that Thanos will seek to conquer Earth in the near future. If Odin is freed, his intervention will prevent Thanos from enslaving Earth in the near future. If not, the Earth will pay a heavy price if Odin will refuse to help Thor fight Thanos, as Thanos will end up enslaving Earth, taking centuries for it to be liberated from his tyranny.
* Thanos is the main antagonist in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet]]''.

===Toys===
* [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]]; [[Diamond Select Toys]]; [[Bowen Designs]] and Eaglemoss have also released mini-busts and statues of the character.
