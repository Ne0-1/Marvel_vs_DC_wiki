'''Thanos''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s and other [[Mass media|media]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and was created by writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]].

Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of comic books]], the character has featured in over three decades of Marvel continuity and a self-titled series. The character's name is a derivation of [[Thanatos]], the personification of death and mortality in [[Greek mythology]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} One of his more prominent storylines to date—the [[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]] series—portrayed him as a mad [[wikt:Special:Search/cosmic|cosmic]] tyrant bent on slaying half of all [[sentience]]s existing then in Marvel's [[multiverse]] in order to appease the [[Marvel Universe]]'s actual embodied personification of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] in an attempt to win its love.

Thanos has consistently recurred as a powerful villain, and has been featured across nearly Marvel's entire product line, including [[Animation|animated]] television series, [[Arcade game|arcade]] and [[video games]], toys and [[trading cards]].

== Origin of the character ==
Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] originally conceived Thanos of Titan during college psychology classes. As Starlin described:

{{cquote|I went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos ... and [[Drax the Destroyer]], but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] Roy [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of ''[[Iron Man]]''. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches ... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060617192251/www.http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm]</ref>}}

Although there are parallels with [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Darkseid]], Starlin has said this was not quite the case:

{{cquote|Kirby had done the [[New Gods]], which I thought was terrific. He was over at DC at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said : "Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!"<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/24/comic-book-legends-revealed-266/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #266 |work=Comics Should Be Good |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}</ref> }}

==Fictional character biography==
Thanos was born on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], a moon of [[Saturn]], to [[A'lars|Mentor]] and [[Sui-San]]. Thanos is born with the Deviant gene and as resembles the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]—the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]' cousin race—more than his own people. Although treated fairly by his race, he is mindful of his appearance and becomes distant, only keeping company with his brother [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]] (Starfox). During his childhood, he becomes fascinated with nihilism and death, eventually falling in love with its embodiment, [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]]. As an adult, Thanos uses bionics and mysticism to become the most powerful of the Titan, and is often referred to as the '''Mad Titan'''.<ref name="AvengersAnnual7">''Avengers'' Annual #7 (1977)</ref>

===The First Thanos War===
Wishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]] that kills millions of his race.<ref>''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #67 (July 1992)</ref> He then travels to Earth in search of the [[Cosmic Cube]].

Thanos eventually locates the Cube and wills it to make him omnipotent. Captain Marvel, with the aid of [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] and ISAAC, are able to defeat him by destroying the cube, which Thanos had left unguarded.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #33 (July 1974)</ref>

Thanos joins Warlock in the [[Infinity Watch]] and helps him to defeat his [[Magus (comics)|evil]]<ref>’’The Infinity War’’ #1-6 (1992)</ref> and [[Goddess (comics)|good]]<ref>‘’The Infinity Crusade’’ #1-6 (1993)</ref> sides, as well as to cure [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] of “Warrior Madness.” <ref>''Thor' #470 & 471 (Jan. - Feb 1994); ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #88 (Jan. 1994); ''Warlock Chronicles'' #8 (Feb. 1994) and ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #25 (Feb. 1994)</ref>

Thanos later recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of [[Geatar]] in a mission to extract a robot containing the knowledge of a universal library.<ref>’’Secret Defenders’’ #11-14</ref> Thanos uses information from the robot to battle [[Tyrant (comics)|Tyrant]], a failed creation of Galactus.<ref>''Cosmic Powers'' #1–6 (1994)</ref>

Thanos is somehow trapped in an alternate dimension and employs the aid of the brother of [[Ka-Zar#Kevin Plunder|Ka-Zar]], [[Plunderer|Parnival Plunder]], in an attempted escape, but fails.<ref>''Ka-Zar'' vol. 2, #4–10 + Annual 1997</ref> Thanos attempts to use the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as a physical anchor back to the [[Earth-616]] universe but is again unsuccessful.<ref>''X-Man and Hulk'' Annual 1998</ref> Thanos is somehow freed and quickly comes into conflict with Thor.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #21–25 (Mar. - July)</ref> During their battle, Thanos decimates the planet [[Rigellians (comics)|Rigel-3]].<ref>''Thor'' Annual 2000</ref>

===The Infinity Abyss===
Thanos then uses the heroes Thor and [[Genis-Vell]] (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17–19 (Jun - Aug. 2001)</ref> Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new race of Gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers, former member [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], and her son Quoi, apparently destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the '''Rot''', an aberration in deep space that is apparently their offspring.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1–8 (2001–2002)</ref> Thanos once conducted extensive research on genetics, and after studying many of the universe's heroes and villains cloned them and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of [[Professor X]], Iron Man, [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Doctor Strange]], and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered by Thor and Ka-Zar were his clones. The true Thanos—with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange—destroys the remaining clones.<ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' # 1–6 (2002)</ref>

Thanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his universal hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated by a cosmic threat known as Hunger, which feeds on entire universes, into freeing it. Thanos unsuccessfully battles Galactus in an effort to stop him from freeing the entity, but when Hunger emerges the two team up to defeat it.<ref>''Thanos'' 1-6</ref>

Thanos journeys to the [[Kyln]], an intergalactic prison. On his way there he meets Death, who for the first time in their long history speaks directly with him. She says she is worth his efforts to woo, but that he must offer her something other than death. At the Kyln he meets [[Star-Lord]] and the [[Shi'ar]] warrior [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], who are both prisoners. He encounters the [[Beyonder]], who has been rendered amnesiac by his/her choice to assume a mortal female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder and causes her mind to shut down leaving her power trapped within a comatose mortal body, which he instructs the Kyln officers to keep on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the Beyonder from once again being reborn.<ref>''Thanos'' 7-9</ref>

Thanos then departs the Kyln in the company of Skreet, a chaos-mite he freed from the prison in a quest to seek the Fallen, a former [[Herald of Galactus]]. Thanos resurrects the ex-herald and places him under his complete mental control.<ref>''Thanos'' 10-12</ref>

===Annihilation===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
During the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]] Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain [[Annihilus]]. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters [[Tenebrous (Marvel Comics)|Tenebrous]] and [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]]—two of [[Galactus]]' ancient enemies. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus' true goal is to use the [[Power Cosmic]] to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. [[Drax the Destroyer]] kills Thanos before he can do so.<ref>''Annihilation'' #4 (2006)</ref> During a climactic battle with Annihilus, [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death as her apparent consort.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (2007)</ref>

Thanos is the Guardians' only hope against the [[The Thanos Imperative|invading Cancerverse]], and [[Star-Lord]] releases him to let him help.<ref>''Thanos Imperative'' #1</ref> In the Cancerverse, only Thanos can slay the undying creatures that dwell there. Upon learning that he is unable to die, Thanos  surrenders to Mar-Vell in return for granting him death.<ref>''Thanos Imperative'' #5</ref> When Mar-Vell attempts to kill Thanos, [[Death (comics)|Death]] is able to kill Mar-vell first.

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] member of the race of superhumans known as the [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titanian]] Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but in some cases far beyond any other known member of his race; acquired through a combination of his mutant Eternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and the entity Death. He has demonstrated enormous superhuman strength, stamina, and particularly durability; is able to absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy; is virtually ageless and immortal; does not need food, drink, or oxygen; and is capable of certain [[telekinesis]], as well as telepathy and matter manipulation. The advanced technology within his transportation chairs includes [[force field]] projection, [[time travel]], movement through [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s, space flight, and [[teleportation]] over interstellar distances. Thanos is an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.

Thanos possesses superhuman intellect (he considers his mind his greatest weapon) and has knowledge of Celestial and other alien technology. Thanos is a genius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding contemporary Earth science. He is also a master strategist and sometimes utilizes a space vessel called ''Sanctuary II'' as a base of operations.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Thanos features in the animated television series ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' voiced by [[Gary Krawford]]. Owing to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s broadcast standards, Thanos is depicted as a worshipper of a female personification of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] rather than death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/toon/lbrody.html |title=Interview with Larry Brody |publisher=Marvelite.prohosting.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref>
* Thanos is featured in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in Season One and by [[Jim Cummings]] in Season Two. In "If This Be My Thanos," he appears before [[Doctor Doom]] offering the Infinity Gems if he can help him obtain a specific item from the Baxter Building. He alongside Doctor Doom, [[MODOK]], [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and [[Trapster]] attack the Baxter Building while the Super Hero Squad and the Fantastic Four were busy fighting the [[Skrull]]s. When the Super Hero Squad and the Fantastic Four returned to help [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]], the Skrull ship arrived and started to beam up Thanos. It turned out that the Thanos that Doctor Doom was helping was actually a Skrull Con-Man in disguise. In "This Al Dente Earth," the real Thanos was seen when Iron Man was thrown on the window sill of his spaceship and then wiped off. Thanos has been confirmed to be the primary villain in Season Two as he will seek the six Infinity Gems in order to prove his superiority to Nebula and gain supremacy over the universe. In the two-part episode "Another Order of Evil," he finds the Infinity Gauntlet when Captain Marvel arrives on his way to a peace conference between the Kree and the Skrull. Thanos ends up using the Soul Gem to suck Captain Marvel into it. He then plots to use the Soul Gem to cause the Kree and the Skrull to fight each other. He then tried to do the same to the Super Hero Squad only to be stopped by Scarlet Witch (who also manages to free Captain Marvel from the Soul Gem). In the episode "World War Witch," Thanos obtains the Time Gem and tries to send the Space Helicarrier to another time only for Scarlet Witch to end up sent to the World War II era. In the episode "Fate of Destiny", Thanos finally obtained all of the Infinity Stones, but soon after, he lost the Infinity Gauntlet to the Silver Surfer (who was corrupted by the Infinity Sword) and became trapped in the Soul Stone with [[Adam Warlock]], whom he had imprisoned once before. The two appear in the rest of the season in cameos as a "sitcom duo" laying in a bunk bed with Thanos talking about starting a chicken farm and expressing his love of chickens before finally being freed in the episode "The Final Battle," where they go ahead with the farm idea.
