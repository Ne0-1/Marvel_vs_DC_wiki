'''Jean-Paul DuChamp''', typically referred to as '''"Frenchie"''', is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]].  He is primarily seen as the [[aviator|pilot]] and [[sidekick]] to [[Moon Knight]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in [[Werewolf by Night]] #32, in August 1975, which also featured the first appearance of [[Moon Knight]]. The character would next appear in [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]] issue 49, in July 1977, becoming a recurring character in the 1980 Moon Knight series, and the 1989 series Marc Spector: Moon Knight. The character also played a significant role in the 2006 Moon Knight series and is featured in the current ongoing series Vengeance of the Moon Knight.<ref>http://comicbookdb.com/character_chron.php?ID=10609</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Frenchie was originally romantically involved with a woman named Isabelle Kristel, but she later left him. After this, he became a mercenary, where he encountered [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]] and [[Bushman (comics)|Bushman]]. Once Spector became Moon Knight, Frenchie helped him fight Bushman, who had betrayed them. He would later design and build Moon Knight’s Mooncopter.

Frenchie then went undercover in order to infiltrate the crime organisation the Committee, under the alis “Monsieur LeBlank”, which allowed Moon Knight to bring down the organisation. 

Frenchie was later crippled when Moon Knight’s brother Randall Spector caused an explosion at Moon Knight’s [[mansion]]. His girlfriend Chloe Tran also informed him that he carried the bloodline of the Hellbent, a race of supernatural beings, and that he has the ability to transform into his ancestors. 

After being driven away by Moon Knight, Frenchie began to have an affair with Rob Silverman, and they opened and ran a restaurant called “En Table”. [[Norman Osborn]] learned that Frenchie was an associate of Moon Knight, and sent a gang to kill him and Silverman in order to provoke Moon Knight. The attack left Silverman in critical condition, which caused Frenchie and Moon Knight to again join forces and attack the gang who attacked them.<ref>http://marvel.com/universe/Frenchie_(DuChamp,_Jean-Paul)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Frenchie possesses no superhuman powers or abilities, although he is a skilled pilot.
