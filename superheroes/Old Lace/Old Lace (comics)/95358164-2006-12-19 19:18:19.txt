'''Old Lace''' is a fictional character in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She first appeared in ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' (volume 1) #2, and was created by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and [[Adrian Alphona]].

Old Lace is a genetically engineered ''[[Deinonychus]]'' (though she was originally believed to have been a ''[[Velociraptor]]'') which [[Gertrude Yorkes]] inherited her from her supervillian parents, who sought to have Old Lace used as a weapon to fight superheroes. Old Lace has a [[telepathic]] bond with Gert. This lets her feel each others' thoughts and pain, and lets Old Lace be able to act on Gert's [[emotion]]s.

Old Lace got her name from Gert Yorkes, who had temporarily been using "Arsenic" as her codename (essentially making the pair Arsenic and Old Lace, after [[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)]] and [[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)]]. Though Gertrude later dropped the codename after deciding that some things from her parents (such as her real name) were worth keeping, Old Lace's name stuck.

When Yorkes was fatally wounded by [[Geoffrey Wilder]], she was able to pass her telepathic link with Old Lace to her boyfriend [[Chase Stein]] before dying, since her death would have killed Lace as well via their telepathic link. 

Chase, after his girlfriend's death, has been using Old Lace in a much more angrier or aggressive manner, even going so far as to command Old Lace to rip an enemy's throat out.
