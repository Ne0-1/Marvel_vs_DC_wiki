'''Old Lace''' is a fictional character in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She first appeared in ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' vol. 1 #2, and was created by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and [[Adrian Alphona]].

==Fictional character biography==
Old Lace is a genetically engineered [[deinonychus]] (though she was originally believed to have been a [[velociraptor]]) which [[Gertrude Yorkes]] inherited her from her supervillain parents, who sought to have Old Lace used as a weapon to fight superheroes. Old Lace has a [[telepathic]] bond with Gert. This lets her feel each others' thoughts and pain, and allows Old Lace to act on Gert's [[emotion]]s.

Old Lace got her name from Gert Yorkes, who had temporarily been using "Arsenic" as her codename (essentially making the pair Arsenic and Old Lace, after the [[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|play]] and [[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|film]] of the same name). Though Gertrude later dropped the codename after deciding that some things from her parents (such as her real name) were worth keeping, Old Lace's name stuck.

When Yorkes was fatally wounded by [[Geoffrey Wilder]], she was able to pass her telepathic link with Old Lace to her boyfriend [[Chase Stein]] before dying, since her death would have killed Lace as well via their telepathic link. 

Chase, after his girlfriend's death, has been using Old Lace in a much more angry and aggressive manner, even going so far as to command Old Lace to rip an enemy's throat out though eventually was called off by Chase after being scolded by Nico. The deinonychus later went on to follow Chase but when ordered to hurt Karolina as well as Nico, Old Lace showed her own will by greeting them warmly. 

Old Lace can also be found in the [[Marvel Zombies Vs. The Army of Darkness]] book.  In several panels you see the zombified [[Runaways]] feeding upon Old Lace while a group of zombies chases down [[Blob]].
