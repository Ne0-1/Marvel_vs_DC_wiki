'''Black Tarantula''' is the name of a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The character is the leader of a Brazilian crime syndicate who poses as an immortal. 

==Fictional character biography==
The origin of the Black Tarantula is shrouded in mystery and misinformation. There is a legend that the Black Tarantula was an European explorer, who travelled to Japan several centuries ago and was trained by the [[ninja]]-clan [[hand (comics)|the Hand]]. At the end of the training he was awarded with a special potion that gave him superhuman powers and immortality. In reality, the Black Tarantula's immortality has a more earthly origin: the title is inherited from father to son, all posing as the same person (reminiscent of [[the Phantom]]). Despite not being truly immortal, the Black Tarantula really does have a multitude of superhuman powers as a result of the potion his ancestor drank.

The current Black Tarantula moved his base of operations from [[Brazil]] to New York, claiming that he wanted to expand his operation, but in fact he was looking for his ex-wife Marina, who had fled the country with their son. Marina disliked the changes that Carlos underwent when he took on the mantle of the Black Tarantula and didn't want the same fate for her son. The Black Tarantula came into conflict with the local crimelord [[Richard Fisk|the Rose]] ([[Jacob Conover]]). He defeated the Rose's enforcer, [[Delilah (comics)|Delilah]], and healed her afterwards. Delilah felt humiliated and swore to pay him back. The Black Tarantula hired [[Roughhouse]] and [[Bloodscream]] to his dirty work and he drove back the Rose, establishing control over a large part of New York City. When the Rose went to [[Fortunato (Marvel Comics)|Don Fortunato]], a powerful crime-lord ruling over New York City, for help, the Black Tarantula appeared in person and offered Fortunato an alliance. Fortunato accepted, but the Black Tarantula had to prove his loyalty by defeating [[Spider-Man]] and bringing back his mask. Black Tarantula did as he was asked and defeated Spider-Man, but let him live when he found out that Spider-Man was trying to rescue a [[Normie Osborn|small child]]. 

Spider-Man would take on the identity of [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] during the "[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis|Identity Crisis]]" storyline to infiltrate the Rose's organisation and find out more about Black Tarantula, fighting Bloodscream and Roughhouse with his former enemy Delilah (Although she was taken out by Bloodscream, forcing Spider-Man to use all four of his new identities against his foes). During this time he found a photo of his wife [[Mary Jane Watson]] and two of her friends. Spider-Man found out that Marina, one of her friends, was in fact the Black Tarantula's ex-wife. Furthermore, Marina had a friend, who was Don Fortunato's cousin. They asked Don Fortunato for protection and the Black Tarantula attacked Don Fortunato's mansion. Inside the mansion, Black Tarantula defeated Fortunato's guard and fought Spider-Man. Black Tarantula defeated Spider-Man again, but lost his wife when she confronted him and pointed out that he was scaring his own son. She reminded him what a burden the Black Tarantula title had been on him and Carlos relented. He left, but told her that he would one day come back to take his son.

Recently in [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] #86 (''August, 2006''), Tarantula was seen in jail.  During a riot at [[Ryker's Island]], Tarantula was attacked by the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], who stabbed him in the chest with a playing card.

In Daredevil Annual #1 Black Tarantula is released early from prison due to a record of good behavior and prison overpopulation.  Carlos goes to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] for a job, Matt haves him work with [[Dakota North]], an investigator working for [[Foggy Nelson|Nelson]] & Murdock.  Carlos, who is dissatisfied with the job, longs for a more hands on approach to stop crime.  Matt notices and takes Carlos with him to battle a [[Yakuza]] gang working in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].  The leader of the Yakuza gang flees from the attack; Daredevil chases him but fails to catch him because he has the flu which is retarding with his abilities.  Black Tarantula and Daredevil survey the scene and notice a large pile of money, Black Tarantula says that he would like to take the money but Daredevil stops him.  Later, Black Tarantula takes on a gang whose leader was hired to kill an old woman.  The leader of the gang is former disciple of Black Tarantula who goes by "Little Loco".  After Black Tarantula takes care of the gang, he kills Loco by choking him with the money he was paid for killing the women. Daredevil shows up at the scene, asking what Black Tarantula has done, Black Tarantula then tells him that he plans on taking the rest of the money from the hideout, Daredevil attempts to stop him but is knocked out with a single punch from Black Tarantula.  Black Tarantula collects the money and gets ready to leave, but before he goes he kneels in front of Daredevil and heals the flu heâ€™s been afflicted with.  Black Tarantula leaves the money he took from the gang in a church, with a note saying "Help people with this."

==Powers and abilities==
Black Tarantula has superhuman physical abilities due to the potion passed through the family. The exact levels are unknown but he was far stronger than [[Spider-Man]]. He is superhumanly resistant to injury and can heal himself from most injuries. He can also heal others from injuries such as a broken neck. He can fire powerful beams of energy from his eyes. 

According to legend, the (original) Black Tarantula was trained by [[hand (comics)|the Hand]]. Whether this is true or not, the Black Tarantula is extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, so much so that he (or one of his predecessors) was able to found a Splinter Group from the hand named the True Believers, disbanded since his time in Jail.

In the MC2 universe, it is shown in a flashback that the original Black Tarantula gained his powers through a ritual that looked the same as the one Ezekiel used to gain spider powers in the MC1 universe. This may infer that the black tarantula's powers come from the same totemic source of the Other/Great Weaver, like Spider-Man (and possibly Spider-Girl).

==Other versions==
===[[MC2]]===

In the alternate future [[MC2]], '''Fabian LaMuerto''', the son of the current Black Tarantula has taken up his father's mantle. Fabian wears a variation of his father's suit, removing the sleevs and using futuristic metal gauntlets and boot-soles, and possesses the same superhuman powers as his father, as well is trained in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts. He would made his first appearance in a conflict with the crime lord [[Canis (comics)|Canis]].

Many originally thought he was responsible for the death of Wilson Fisk. It was proven later to be Canis. Fabian later confronted Canis, and was about to do away with him, until Spider-Girl intervened. She talked Fabian out of committing the act, after which he departed. Later, the Black Tarantula started to show an interest in May's crime fighting career. Spider-Girl makes the discovery later though, that her benefactor is working with [[Lady Octopus]] to replace Canis as the Kingpin of Crime. Feeling betrayed, she accused him of using her. Fabian denied it, stating he is fascinated by her and that they are destined to be friends, if not more. [[Kaine]] and his team arrive, buying Lady Octopus time to run, while being pursued by [[Raptor (comics)|Raptor]] and Spider-Girl. Black Tarantula defeats the combined forces of Kaine, Quickwire, and Big Man. He then willing surrenders to Spider-Girl, not wanting to harm her. Fabian later escapes custody.

Though a criminal, this Black Tarantula has a deep sense of honor, and he has helped support [[Spider-Girl]]'s crime-fighting career. He does have a hidden agenda, however--he hopes to win her over as "his mate." Black Tarantula and Spider-Girl face each other often, and their story is ongoing. He attempted to negotiate with the [[Cabal of Scriers]] (the former lackeys of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]) to call off their hit on Spider-Girl, and when this failed, he challenged their leader to mortal combat for leadership of the Cabal.  Victorious, he ordered the hit cancelled. 

In ''Amazing Spider-girl #3'' it is revealed that after the time jump between the series, the Black Tarantula is the current kingpin of crime and it is implied that he is interested in the mysterious item that Mona Carlo is carrying. Mona, a known con artist, stole a disk from her boyfriend and was planning to sell it. The disk supposedly contained information about the organization of [[Wilson Fisk]]. Black Tarantula and the Hobgoblin were about to start a war to obtain it. Fortunately, with the help of Mad Dog, Spider-Girl obtained the disk and left Mona safely with the police. Chesbro reported to Black Tarantula about Spider-Girl's interference. Fabian decided to move on, but sent a threat to the Hobgoblin, warning him to "back off" of Spider-Girl.
