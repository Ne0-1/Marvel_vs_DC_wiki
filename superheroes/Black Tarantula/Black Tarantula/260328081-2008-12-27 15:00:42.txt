'''Black Tarantula''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears as an [[unseen character]] in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #419 (January 1997), and makes his first full appearance in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #432 (March 1998). Black Tarantula was created by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Steve Skroce]].

==Fictional character biography==
The origin of the Black [[Tarantula]] is shrouded in mystery and misinformation. There is a legend that the Black Tarantula was a European explorer, who travelled to Japan several centuries ago and was trained by the [[ninja]]-clan [[hand (comics)|the Hand]]. At the end of the training he was awarded with a special potion that gave him superhuman powers and immortality. In reality, the Black Tarantula's immortality has a more earthly origin: the title is inherited from father to son, all posing as the same person (reminiscent of [[the Phantom]]). Though not truly immortal, the Black Tarantula possesses a multitude of superhuman powers as a result of the potion his ancestor drank.

===Spider-Man===
The current Black Tarantula moves his base of operations from [[Argentina]] to New York, claiming that he wants to expand his operation. He comes into conflict with the local crimelord [[Richard Fisk|The Rose]] (Jacob Conover), and defeats the Rose's enforcer, [[Delilah (comics)|Delilah]], though heals her severe injuries afterwards. The Black Tarantula hires [[Roughhouse]] and [[Bloodscream]] to his dirty work and drives back the Rose, establishing control over a large part of New York City. When the Rose goes to [[Fortunato (Marvel Comics)|Don Fortunato]], a powerful crime-lord ruling over New York City, for help, the Black Tarantula appears in person and offer Fortunato an alliance. Fortunato accepts, but the Black Tarantula has to prove his loyalty by defeating [[Spider-Man]] and bringing back his mask. Black Tarantula did as he was asked and defeated Spider-Man, but lets him live when he learns that Spider-Man was trying to rescue a [[Normie Osborn|small child]]. 

Spider-Man takes on the identity of [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] during the "[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis|Identity Crisis]]" storyline to infiltrate the Rose's organisation and find out more about Black Tarantula, fighting Bloodscream and Roughhouse with his former enemy Delilah (Although she is taken out by Bloodscream, forcing Spider-Man to use all four of his new identities against his foes). During this time, he finds a photo of his wife [[Mary Jane Watson]] and two of her friends. Spider-Man discovers that Marina, one of her friends, was in fact the Black Tarantula's ex-wife, who had fled the country with their son, disliking the changes that Carlos underwent when he took on the mantle of the Black Tarantula and did not want the same fate for her son. Furthermore, Marina had a friend, who was Don Fortunato's cousin. They ask Don Fortunato for protection and the Black Tarantula attacked Don Fortunato's mansion. Inside the mansion, Black Tarantula defeats Fortunato's guards including Spider-Man again, but loses his wife when she confronts him and points out that he is scaring his own son. She reminds him what a burden the Black Tarantula title had been on him and Carlos relented. He leaves, but tells her that he would one day come back to take his son.

===Daredevil===
Black Tarantula is later seen in jail at [[Ryker's Island]] and is taking drugs that suppresses his superhuman powers. During a riot, Tarantula is attacked by the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], who stabs him in the chest with a playing card. <ref> Daredevil #86 (''August, 2006'')</ref> Black Tarantula is released early from prison due to a record of good behavior and prison overpopulation. Carlos goes to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] for a job, Matt has him work with [[Dakota North]], an investigator working for [[Foggy Nelson|Nelson]] & Murdock.  Carlos, who is dissatisfied with the job, longs for a more hands on approach to stop crime. Matt notices and takes Carlos with him to battle a [[Yakuza]] gang working in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].  The leader of the Yakuza gang flees from the attack; Daredevil chases him but fails to catch him because he has the flu which is retarding with his abilities.  Black Tarantula and Daredevil survey the scene and notice a large pile of money, Black Tarantula says that he would like to take the money but Daredevil stops him. Later, Black Tarantula takes on a gang whose leader was hired to kill an old woman; this leader is a vengeful former recruit of Black Tarantula; years before, Carlos had personally invited into his gang, naming him "Little Loco". After Black Tarantula takes care of the gang, he kills Loco by choking him with the money he was paid for killing the women. Daredevil shows up at the scene, asking what Black Tarantula has done, Black Tarantula then tells him that he plans on taking the rest of the money from the hideout, Daredevil attempts to stop him but is knocked out with a single punch from Black Tarantula.  Black Tarantula collects the money and gets ready to leave, but before he goes he kneels in front of Daredevil and heals the flu heâ€™s been afflicted with.  Black Tarantula leaves the money he took from the gang in a church, with a note saying "Help people with this."  <ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1</ref>

Carlos LaMuerto's story will be focused upon again in April 2008, in a one-shot issue entitled '''Daredevil: Blood of the Tarantula''', where he turns in desperation to Matt Murdock to help his new 'mission'. <ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=8634 marvel.com Solicitations, DAREDEVIL: BLOOD OF THE TARANTULA #1]</ref>

===MC2===
[[Image:Sonofblacktarantula.png|175px|thumbnail|left|Fabian as the Black Tarantula.]]

In the alternate future [[MC2]], '''Fabian LaMuerto''', the son of the current Black Tarantula has taken up his father's mantle. Fabian wears a variation of his father's suit, removing the sleeves and using futuristic metal gauntlets and boot-soles, and possesses the same superhuman powers as his father, as well is trained in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts. He would made his first appearance in a conflict with the crime lord [[Canis (comics)|Canis]].

Many originally thought he was responsible for the death of Wilson Fisk. It was proven later to be Canis. Fabian later confronted Canis, and was about to do away with him, until Spider-Girl intervened. She talked Fabian out of committing the act, after which he departed. Later, the Black Tarantula started to show an interest in May's crime fighting career. Spider-Girl makes the discovery later though, that her benefactor is working with [[Lady Octopus]] to replace Canis as the Kingpin of Crime. Feeling betrayed, she accused him of using her. Fabian denied it, stating he is fascinated by her and that they are destined to be friends, if not more. [[Kaine]] and his team arrive, buying Lady Octopus time to run, while being pursued by [[Raptor (comics)|Raptor]] and Spider-Girl. Black Tarantula defeats the combined forces of Kaine, Quickwire, and Big Man. He then willing surrenders to Spider-Girl, not wanting to harm her. Fabian later escapes custody.

Though a criminal, this Black Tarantula has a deep sense of honor, and he has helped support [[Spider-Girl]]'s crime-fighting career. He does have a hidden agenda, however--he hopes to win her over as "his mate." Black Tarantula and Spider-Girl face each other often, and their story is ongoing. He attempted to negotiate with the [[Cabal of Scriers]] (the former lackeys of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]) to call off their hit on Spider-Girl, and when this failed, he challenged their leader to mortal combat for leadership of the Cabal.  Victorious, he ordered the hit cancelled. 

In ''Amazing Spider-girl #3'' it is revealed that after the time jump between the series, the Black Tarantula is the current kingpin of crime and it is implied that he is interested in the mysterious item that Mona Carlo is carrying. Mona, a known con artist, stole a disk from her boyfriend and was planning to sell it. The disk supposedly contained information about the organization of [[Wilson Fisk]]. Black Tarantula and the Hobgoblin were about to start a war to obtain it. Fortunately, with the help of Mad Dog, Spider-Girl obtained the disk and left Mona safely with the police. Chesbro reported to Black Tarantula about Spider-Girl's interference. Fabian decided to move on, but sent a threat to the Hobgoblin, warning him to "back off" of Spider-Girl.

==Powers and Abilities==
Black Tarantula possesses superhuman strength enabling him to lift (press) up to 25 tons. He also possesses superhuman speed, agility and durability of an unquantified degree. He has a powerful [[healing factor]] on par with the likes of [[Wolverine]] or [[Deadpool]] that, combined with his superhuman durability, make him extremely difficult to seriously injure. He is also able to stimulate the healing process in other people's bodies, though he does this rarely. He is able to fire laser-like beams from his eyes, but this drains his physical resources severely so it is only a last resort.

Black Tarantula also is skilled at different forms of martial arts, and has a genius level intellect.
