'''Nighthawk''' (birth name Kyle Richmond) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  

Versions of Nighthawk also exist in the [[alternate universe]]s of the [[Squadron Supreme]] and [[Supreme Power]].

== Mainstream Marvel Universe ==

Nighthawk's main superhuman ability is superhuman strength, with the uncommon limitation that this strength remains only from sundown to sunup; he has the strength of a normal man who exercises regularly in the daytime.  His strength derives from a [[potion]] he discovered in a book on [[alchemy]]; the potion was meant to cure his weak heart, the super strength being only an unintended albeit very welcome side effect.  He flies with the use of a jetpack concealed under artificial wings, and usually used some kind of [[projectile]] weapon under them as well.

As Kyle Richmond, he was an egotistical and wealthy playboy who, unlike comics' [[archetype|archetypical]] playboy [[Batman]], actually drank and womanized too much.  Indeed, his father had to pay hush money to protect Richmond's name after a drunk-driving accident that injured a woman.

Nighthawk began as a [[supervillain]], a member of the [[Squadron Sinister]], who fought [[The Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]].  Later he repented of his villainous ways and joined the super-team [[The Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]].

Despite his unusual powers and his leadership role in that group, Nighthawk never really took off into mass popularity.  He did get his own self-titled series in 1998, but it didn't last very long.

== Squadron Supreme ==

In his Squadron Supreme incarnation, Nighthawk is much the same as his mainstream counterpart, and a closer analogue of his original inspiration, Batman.  He did not, however, lose his parents to crime; they died of natural causes.  Nevertheless, Richmond vows to use his money and skills to fight evil, and becomes friends with his earth's champion, [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].

== Supreme Power ==

In ''Supreme Power'', [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s update and revamp of the old Squadron Supreme characters in Marvel's mature line, MAX, Nighthawk (still Kyle Richmond) is an [[African American]] entrepreneur.  Having lost both his parents in a [[hate crime]] at a young age, he takes revenge on criminals --- at least for the beginning of the series, however, solely on those criminals who prey on black victims.  Like his inspiration, Batman, Nighthawk uses a combination of high-tech weaponry, stealth and fighting prowess to overcome his foes.  Also like Batman (as depicted by most writers since [[Frank Miller]]'s seminal ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''), Nighthawk keeps his distance from and feels some disdain for his version of [[Superman]], Hyperion.
