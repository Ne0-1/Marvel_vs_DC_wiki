'''Nighthawk''' is the name of several [[fictional]] [[comic book]] characters that appear in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Multiverse|multiverse]]:<ref>Number confirmed by the ''[[Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe]]: Alternate Worlds 2005''</ref> A [[supervillain]]-turned-[[superhero]] in the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] (dubbed [[Earth-616]]), who was originally a member of the supervillain team the [[Squadron Sinister]]; and three superheroes from [[alternate universe]]s. The three heroes each belong to a version of the team the Squadron Supreme (the [[Squadron Supreme]] of [[Earth-712]] and the [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]] of [[Earth-31916]] respectively).<!--That's only two. One appears missing-->

==Publication history==
===Original Nighthawk===
The first Nighthawk in Marvel Comics debuted in the final panel of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), part one of a three-issue story by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]]. This story arc introduced the [[supervillain]] team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]]. Nighthawk was based on [[Batman]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72â€“73</ref> Nighthawk appeared again as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #62 (March 1970). He then aids the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] against his former teammates the Squadron Sinister in ''The Defenders'' #12-13 (Feb. & May 1974), reforming and joining the Defenders as an active member through issue #23 (May 1975) and  ''Giant-Size Defenders'' #2-5 (Oct. 1974 - Jan. 1975). He went on to appear in two short solo backup features, one in ''Tales To Astonish'' vol. 2, #13 (Dec. 1980), the other in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #101 (Jan. 1981), in which he also teamed with [[Spider-Man]] in the lead feature. Nearly two decades later, he starred in a miniseries, ''Nighthawk'' #1-3 (Sept.-Nov. 1998) by writer [[Jim Krueger]] and penciller [[Richard Case]].

===Alternate-universe versions===
Thomas and penciller [[John Buscema]] had meanwhile created an [[alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]] in ''The Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971), using characters that shared names with those of the Squadron Sinister. This caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) cover-blurbed appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact the Squadron Supreme appeared in both issues. This Squadron Supreme starred in an eponymous, 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and successive pencillers Bob Hall, Buscema, and Paul Ryan. ''Squadron Supreme'' focused on the exploits of the team in its home reality. Gruenwald, Ryan, and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]] returned to the characters in the [[graphic-novel]] sequel ''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989). The team later featured in a two-part story across ''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'' and the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (both Sept. 1998). Five years, under the mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint, the 18-issue series ''[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]'' (Oct. 2003 - Oct. 2005), set in a different alternate universe, incorporated yet another version of Nighthawk.

==Fictional character biographies==
=== Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)===<!-- This section is linked from [[Institute of Evil]] -->
The Earth-616 version of Nighthawk, Kyle Richmond, was born in [[Mamaroneck, New York]]. He acquires superhuman powers and first appears as a member of the Squadron Sinister, a group of supervillains assembled by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] - the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. It was [[retcon]]ned years later <ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (of 12) (1986)</ref> that the Grandmaster created the Squadron Sinister based on the ''already existing'' Squadron Supreme. The Avengers simply met the "copies" first. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #85 & #141</ref> Nighthawk battles the Avenger [[Captain America]] but is defeated. After being abandoned by the Grandmaster, Nighthawk becomes a solo adventurer and encounters Daredevil, and after being defeated again decides to reform. <ref>''Daredevil''  #62 (March 1970)</ref>  Richmond also becomes President of Richmond Enterprises at some point.

Nighthawk later resists an offer to rejoin the original members of the Squadron Sinister, who together with the alien [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] attempt to flood the Earth. Nighthawk warns the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] of Nebulon's scheme, and Nighthawk and the Defenders defeated Nebulon and the Squadron Sinister. Nighthawk becomes mortally wounded, however, but is revived by [[Doctor Strange]]'s spell and joins the Defenders. <ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1, #13 - 14</ref> Nighthawk then redesigns his costume, and with the Defenders, he met [[Professor X]] and battled [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1, #15 - 16</ref> Nighthawk's earlier romance with Trish Starr was revealed.<ref>''Defenders'' #21</ref> Nighthawk was later injured by a car bomb planted by [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4</ref> With the Defenders, he encountered the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>''Defenders'' #26-29</ref> Nighthawk was captured, and his brain was removed by the [[Headmen]], and [[Chondu the Mystic|Chondu]]'s brain was transferred into his body.<ref>''Defenders'' #31</ref> Nighthawk's brain was soon restored by the second [[Starlight (comics)|Red Guardian]].<ref>''Defenders'' #36</ref> With the Defenders, Nighthawk later foiled Nebulon's Celestial Mind Control scheme.<ref>''Defenders'' #34-38; ''Defenders Annual'' #1</ref> He teamed with Doctor Strange against the [[Death-Stalker]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #29</ref> With the Defenders, Nighthawk later visited Valhalla.<ref>''Defenders'' #67-68</ref> Nighthawk's secret identity was later revealed, and his activities and finances were investigated by the U.S. government.<ref>''Defenders'' #70</ref> Nighthawk eventually becomes leader of the Defenders. <ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1, #75</ref>

In time, the injunction against him becoming Nighthawk was overturned.<ref>''Defenders'' #88</ref> Nighthawk then teamed with [[Spider-Man]], and learned that his former girlfriend Mindy Williams survived the crash and now possessed psionic powers, but he foiled her revenge scheme.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #101</ref> Nighthawk later became paralytic.<ref>''Defenders'' #93</ref> Doctor Strange's earlier spell was severed, leaving Nighthawk a paralytic by day, but retaining his powers and mobility at night. Nighthawk then encountered [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Defenders'' #95</ref> Nighthawk soon discovered that Mindy Williams's psionic powers were responsible for his paralysis, and freed her from a secret project run by August Masters.<ref>''Defenders'' #102</ref> The government charges against Richmond were finally dropped.<ref>''Defenders'' #103</ref> Soon thereafter, with Captain America, Daredevil, and the Defenders, Nighthawk opposed August Masters's plot to launch a psionic attack against the U.S.S.R. The plot was foiled when Masters's telepaths using Richmond as a focus, triggered explosions of Masters's Colorado Rocky Mountains base. Nighthawk is apparently killed in the explosion.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1, #106</ref> He is much later revealed to have simply been in a coma.<ref>''Nighthawk'' #1 - 3 (1998)</ref> When the original Defenders become mind-controlled and form a new team called [[The Order (comics)|Order]] to enforce world peace, Nighthawk forms and leads a temporary team of Defenders to stop them. When the Order are returned to normal, [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]] bestows upon Kyle the ability to gather the four whenever the Earth is threatened.<ref>''The Order'' #1-6 (2002)</ref> 

During the events of [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Nighthawk initially works with Captain America's [[Secret Avengers]], but later defects to the pro-registration faction led by [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]].<ref>''Civil War'' #4 (2006)</ref>

Soon after this the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] reappears and reforms the Squadron Sinister. A new [[Hyperion (Marvel Comics)#Mark Milton (Earth-712)|Hyperion]] and [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]] try to coerce Nighthawk and fellow member [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]] into rejoining, but both are initially reluctant and they are now working with the superhero team the [[New Thunderbolts]]. Ironically, the New Thunderbolts become responsible for Nighthawk rejoining the Squadron Sinister. He quits in protest when former villain [[Baron Zemo]] joins and also learns that he was simply being used to finance team activities. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the Wellspring of Power - an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities - the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they then battle the New Thunderbolts, as Baron Zemo also wishes to have control of the Wellspring. Zemo manages to defeat the Grandmaster, but in the ensuing chaos the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.  <ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15-16 and ''Thunderbolts'' #102-108</ref>

=== Joaquin Pennysworth (Earth-616)===
{{see also|Defenders (comics)#The Last Defenders}}
Nighthawk reappears as a member of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]], acting as an instructor and liaison at [[Camp Hammond]]. Wanting to rebuild the Defenders, he petitions [[Tony Stark]] for his own Initiative team, but the Defenders he is eventually assigned do not live up to his expectations. The team is led by Nighthawk and made up of The [[Blazing Skull]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]; The Last Defenders are based in [[New Jersey]]. After their first mission is deemed a failure, Stark disbands the team, but Nighthawk continues to use Initiative resources independently in a desperate attempt to rescue [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] agent Joaquin Pennysworth, son of his former business associate. Due to his insubordination, Richmond is forced to give up his Nighthawk identity and retire from super-heroics. Originally despondent, an encounter with a future version of the Defenders led by Joaquin as a new Nighthawk encourages Richmond to use his own resources as head of his company to support the Defenders as a civilian rather than a superhero. Kyle Richmond retires, and oversees the formation of a new team with [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Krang (comics)|Krang]] and led by Joaquin as Nighthawk.<ref>As seen in ''The Last Defenders'' #1-6</ref>

This version also had several costume aids, such as a jet-powered artificial wing system, lasers, artificial claw tips and projectile weapons.
*The Earth-712 versions are physically superior, but lack superpowers. Neil Richmond is a genius and uses a variety of advanced weaponry to aid in combat. Kyle Richmond possessed extensive training and experience in various martial arts. He was a superb gymnast and skilled pilot, and used various equipment designed by Tom Thumb, including a grappling hook cable launcher and the Hoverhawk for transportation.
