'''Nighthawk''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] characters that appear in [[publications]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. There have been five versions of the character: a [[supervillain]]-turned-[[superhero]] from the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] continuity, '''Kyle Richmond''', who belonged to the team [[Squadron Sinister]]; and four from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s, who belonged to various permutations of team [[Squadron Supreme]].

==Publication history==
'''Kyle Richmond''', the original Nighthawk, debuted as a [[supervillain]] in the final panel of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), a [[superhero]] team in the mainstream Marvel Comics continuity the company designates [[Earth-616]]. This story is the first chapter of a three-issue arc by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]]. The [[story arc]] introduced the [[supervillain]] team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]], with Nighthawk based on [[Batman]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72–73</ref>

Following this arc, Nighthawk appeared in a solo adventure in the title ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', before reappearing with the Squadron as antagonists in the superhero team title ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #13-14 (May–July 1974). Nighthawk then reformed, and after adopting a new costume joined the team the following issue.

Nighthawk appeared on a regular basis in ''The Defenders'' and a number of other Marvel titles, including ''Giant-Size Defenders'' 2-5 (Oct. 1974 - July 1975); ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #33-34 and 101 (May–June 1975, Jan. 1981); ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]''  #206-207 (Dec. 1976 - Jan. 1977); ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #34 (Dec. 1977); ''The Avengers'' #167 and 182 (Jan. 1978, April 1979); ''[[Doctor Strange]]'' vol. 2, #29 (June 1978); ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #15 (Dec. 1981); ''Captain America'' #268 (April 1982); and with other heroes in the [[graphic novel]] ''The Death of Captain Marvel'' (April 1982) and the humorous ''Fantastic Four Roast'' (April 1982).

Following a solo adventure in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' vol. 2, #13 (Dec. 1980), he apparently sacrifices his life in ''The Defenders'' #106 (April 1982). The supervillain [[Dead Ringer (comics)|Dead Ringer]] briefly [[impersonate]]d him in ''Captain America'' #429 (July 1994), but is captured. In the three-issue [[miniseries]] ''Nighthawk'' (Sept.-Nov. 1998) Richmond was revealed to be alive, but in a [[coma]] and [[brain death|brain dead]]. Through supernatural means, he was revived and resumed his crime-fighting career, and co-starred in the 12-issue run of ''The Defenders'' vol. 2 (March 2001 - Feb. 2002) and the miniseries ''The Order'' #1-6 (April - Sept. 2002). Afterward, he appeared in the team comics ''New Thunderbolts'' #15-18 (Jan.-April 2006) and ''Thunderbolts'' #100-108 (May 2006 - Jan. 2007), and was among the many heroes featured in the miniseries ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1-7 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007). He went onto to appear sporadically in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', beginning with issue #1 (June 2007). Nighthawk formed a short-lived version of the Defenders with the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], the [[Blazing Skull]], and [[She-Hulk]], as part of the Initiative, and depicted in the miniseries ''The Last Defenders'' #1-6 (May - Oct. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
Kyle Richmond was born to two wealthy parents and was brought up by his [[governess]] while his dad is away. When Kyle's mother died in an accident, his father sent him to boarding school. Due to his family's money, Kyle got into Grayburn College where he became involved with Mindy Williams who helped him focus through his education. One night, Kyle was caught in a drunk-driving accident in which Mindy was killed, and he was kicked out of school and was unable to return. Kyle later became anti-social, and learned that Grayburn College was closed down due to a lack of funds. Kyle Richmond attempted to join the army, but was rejected due to a heart murmur. Afterwards, Kyle received word that his father died in a plane crash and that Kyle has inherited Richmond Enterprises. Kyle turned to finding a cure for his heart murmur and physically training himself.<ref>''Defenders'' #32</ref>

While drunk, Kyle Richmond concocted an alchemy serum that he found in an alchemy volume. The alchemy serum enabled Kyle to gain enhanced strength at night. Kyle took on various sports activities to strengthen his natural abilities where he eventually became Nighthawk. Nighthawk and three other [[supervillain]]s are brought together as the [[Squadron Sinister]] by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which has been forced to act as the champions of the time-traveling conqueror [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Nighthawk battles the Avenger [[Captain America]], who outfights the villain. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #69-71 (Oct.-Dec. 1969)</ref> 

Reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]], the villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] with a plan to melt the [[polar ice caps]] and flood the entirety of the Earth's surface. Despite being asked to join the venture, Nighthawk asks for the aid of superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], who prevent the scheme and defeat the villains and Nebulon.<ref>''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #13-14 (May–July 1974)</ref> 

The character suffers several setbacks as a superhero, including being charged with [[tax evasion]] and [[fraud]] by the [[United States]] government,<ref>''The Defenders'' #70 (April 1979)</ref> and arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for operating as a hero while charges were pending.<ref>''The Defenders'' #81 (March 1980)</ref> This stipulation was waived<ref>''The Defenders'' #87 (Sept.1980)</ref> after he was forced to reveal his [[secret identity]].<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #101 (Jan. 1981)</ref> Nighthawk's cumulative wounds from battle eventually leave him [[paralyzed]].<ref>''The Defenders'' #93 (March 1981)</ref> Recovering to the point that he can move at [[night]],<ref>''The Defenders'' #95 (May 1981)</ref> Nighthawk continues to aid the Defenders, until resigning from the team.<ref>''The Defenders'' #98 (Aug. 1981)</ref> He is advised he is to be cleared of all charges if a predetermined amount is repaid to the government.<ref>''The Defenders'' #103 (Jan. 1982)</ref>

After apparently sacrificing his life to stop an organization bent on attacking the [[Soviet Union]], Richmond turns up alive but comatose. He has a [[Hallucination|vision]] of an [[angel]] that facilitates his healing and bestows on him a "second sight", which enables him to see criminal acts before they are committed. In return, he must punish the would-be criminals. Once healed, Richmond becomes Nighthawk once again and fights crime until forced into a confrontation with Daredevil, whom he kills. The "angel" then reveals itself to be the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who transports Nighthawk and Daredevil's corpse to [[Hell]], intending to claim Daredevil's [[soul]]. Nighthawk battles the demons of Hell and manages to revive Daredevil, and together they escape.<ref>''Nighthawk'' #1-3 (miniseries; Sept.-Nov. 1998)</ref> A [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] later purges him of Mephisto's gift.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

After an adventure with [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]<ref>''The Thing'' vol. 2, #1-3 (Jan.-March 2006)</ref> Nighthawk discovers his abilities are increasing, and learns that his former Squadron Sinister teammate [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] has joined the superhero team the [[New Thunderbolts]]. After encountering teammate [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], apparently resurrected after being thought dead, and a new [[Doctor Spectrum]] (Alice Nugent), Nighthawk briefly joins the New Thunderbolts,<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15-16 (Jan.- Feb. 2006)</ref> but upon discovering he is being used for his fortune, leaves and rejoins the Squadron Sinister.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #17-18 (March–April 2006), ''Thunderbolts'' #100-101 (May–June 2006)</ref> That team learns that the Grandmaster, using an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities, the 
Wellspring of Power, has been increasing the team-members' powers. After a battle between the Squadron and the New Thunderbolts, Nighthawk and the other members of the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #102-108 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref>

Nighthawk is initially opposed to the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline. Following the death of superhero [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]] at the hands of the [[Ragnarok (comics)|cyborg clone of Thor]] on the Pro-Registraion Side, Nighthawk joins the Pro-Registration Side,<ref>''Civil War:Front Line'' #6 (Oct. 2006):''Civil War: Front Line'' #1-11 (Aug. 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> but is defeated in a skirmish with Anti-Registration heroes Falcon and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4, #25 (April 2007)</ref>

He later joins the US government's [[Fifty State Initiative]] of registered heroes,<ref>Beginning in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''#1 (June 2007)</ref> and forms a short-lived Initiative version of the Defenders with the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], the [[Blazing Skull]], and [[She-Hulk]]. With She-Hulk and [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]], Nighthawk battles the group the [[Sons of the Serpent]], which culminates in a confrontation with his old Defenders foe [[List of Marvel Comics characters: Y#Yandroth|Yandroth]]. Yandroth manipulates time and forces Nighthawk to battle a twisted version of his old team the Squadron Sinister before being rescued by a future incarnation of the Defenders. Noting that one of the future members is '''Joaquin Pennyworth''', an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the son of the one-time leader of the Sons of the Serpent, Richmond asks him to commence training to become the new Nighthawk.<ref>''The Last Defenders'' #1-6 (May-Oct. 2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nighthawk is a superb [[Sportsperson|athlete]], who courtesy of an alchemical potion possesses mild super-strength and increased agility and durability from dusk till dawn. He has also used several costume aids, such as a jet-powered artificial wing system, artificial claw tips, [[lasers]] and projectile weapons.

==Other versions==
===Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)===
Roy Thomas and penciller [[John Buscema]] created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]], who debut in ''The Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat.<ref>''The Avengers'' #86 (March 1971)</ref> The characters (including Nighthawk) were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) "cover-blurbed" appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues. 

The heroic Nighthawk and the Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually team together and prevent the use of the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141 - 144 (Nov. 1975 - Feb. 1976) & #147 - 149 (May - July 1976)</ref> The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (comics)#Zhib-Ran|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then Thunder God Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref>

Richmond later retires as Nighthawk, feeling that he can better serve the public good as a politician, eventually becoming President of the United States.  However, President Richmond is mentally assaulted by the alien entity known as the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]], who nearly obliterates the real Richmond's mind and then embarks on a campaign of world domination via an artificial duplicate of the President.  The real Richmond is rescued by a psychic entity from Earth-616 with ties to that world's Kyle Richmond, and reconstructs his mind to make him temporarily believe that he is the Nighthawk of Earth-616 (then presumed deceased by his teammates in the Defenders). When the other Squadron members, save for Hyperion, are mind-controlled by the Overmind (who itself is later revealed to be a pawn of another alien menace, [[Null, the Living Darkness|Null the Living Darkness]]), Hyperion and Nighthawk recruit the Defenders to help free the Squadron and defeat the alien threat. When the Richmond working with the Overmind is revealed to be artificial, Nighthawk recalls his true identity and rejoins the Squadron Supreme.<ref>''Defenders'' #112-114 (Oct.-Dec. 1982)</ref>

The Squadron Supreme feature in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1-12 (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986)</ref> The series reveals each character's origin and explains why the Squadrons Sinister and Supreme are similar: the Grandmaster creates the Squadron Sinister modeled on the already-existing Squadron Supreme of the [[Earth-712]] universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (May 1986)</ref>

The Squadron's Earth lies in shambles after the Overmind's attempt to conquer the world. Led by Hyperion, the Squadron believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a [[Utopia]]. Nighthawk resigns in protest, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule; he also ponders assassinating Hyperion to try and halt the Squadron's plans before they begin.  At a joint press conference, Richmond resigns as President of the United States and the Squadron announces its plans to the public; Richmond comes prepared for an assassination attempt, but cannot bring himself to kill his former teammate. The Squadron assumes overall control of the government of the [[United States]] and remake the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implement a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of [[behavior modification]] in prisons; enforcing a strict gun control policy, and developing medical technology to resurrect the dead. Despite the economic and technological advances, there are setbacks.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Predicting a nightmarish outcome to the Squadron's so-called "Utopia Program", Nighthawk attempts in vain to solicit the aid of the Avengers in the title ''[[Captain America]]''<ref>''Captain America'' #314 (Feb. 1986)</ref> and is eventually forced to confront his old teammates with a new team dubbed the Redeemers, recruited from former Squadron foes and newly emerged superhumans. A brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes Nighthawk was in fact right and ends the battle, and the Squadron disband and release control of the United States to the government.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

The Earth-712 Nighthawk lacks powers but possesses extensive training and uses a variety of advanced weaponry.

Earth-712 is now dominated by corporations using the Squadron's own Utopia technologies, with the characters eventually reinstating [[democracy]]. For years prior to the return of the Squadron Supreme to his universe, Neil had organized and supervised his elite Nighthawks who battled the Blue Eagles enlisted by the corporate New World Order. Nighthawk later joins the Squadron, acting as the team's conscience.<ref>''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (1998)</ref> Nighthawk and the Squadron also come into conflict with a new government when [[interdimensional doorway|interdimensional]] team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], traveling from the Earth-616 universe, reveal that the government had rigged the election with a worldwide vote [[fraud]]. The Squadron and the Exiles depose the new government, and attempt to allow society to progress without superhuman involvement.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2, #77-78 (April–May 2006)</ref> The Earth-712 versions lack powers but possess extensive training and use a variety of advanced weaponry.

Agent Kyle Richmond.

The Avengers managed to get out of their traps and help Falcon to fight Nighthawk. While Hulk and Thor work to shut down the citadel, the others fought Nighthawk where they managed to defeat him and remand him to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

This is proven right when Hyperion arrives and frees Nighthawk in front of Nick Fury. Nighthawk and Hyperion then leave to get their group together.
