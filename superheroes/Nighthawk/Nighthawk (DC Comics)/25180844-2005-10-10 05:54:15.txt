'''Nighthawk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  His real name is Hannibal Hawkes, and he first appeared in ''[[Western Comics]]'' #5. In his [[secret identity]], he worked as a travelling repairman. He had a [[sidekick]] named Jim Peyton.

He was shown as dying in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], although this has been [[retcon]]ned twice to fit in with the later revelation that he was a [[reincarnation]] of Prince Khufu (who would later be reincarnated as [[Hawkman]]). Current continuity has it that he was shot by a criminal named Matilda Roderic, who was presumably a reincarnation of the evil preist Hath-Set, who is apparently destined to kill Khufu in every life. Rodric's descendant is the current Hath-Set.

The Hawkman retcon also revealed he was the partner and lover of the Western heroine [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]], who was the reincarnation of Khufu's wife [[Hawkgirl|Chay-Ara]].

A modern-day version of the character appeared in the Western-themed ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' Annual #6, as a mercenary. He worked with Robin and the modern day [[Pow-Wow Smith]] to track down the modern day [[Trigger Twins]].
