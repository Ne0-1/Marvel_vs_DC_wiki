==Fictional character biography==
He was shown as dying during ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'',<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #3 (June 1985).</ref> although this has been [[retcon]]ned twice to fit in with the later revelation that he was a [[reincarnation]] of Prince Khufu{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} — who would later be reincarnated as [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]], the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Hawkman]]. Current continuity has it that he was shot by a criminal named Matilda Roderic,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} who was presumably a reincarnation of the evil priest [[Hath-Set]], who is apparently destined to kill Khufu in every life. Roderic's descendant is the current Hath-Set.

The Hawkman retcon also revealed he was the partner and lover of the Western heroine [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} who was the reincarnation of Khufu's wife [[Hawkgirl#Shiera Sanders|Chay-Ara]].

Nighthawk appears in [[Guy Gardner (comics)|''Guy Gardner'']] #24<ref>''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #24 (Sept. 1994).</ref> during the "[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]" incident. He sported white sideburns at this point in time. His group of allies, which includes El Diablo and [[Bat Lash]], were forming to take on the villain Extant and several men Extant had brainwashed. Nighthawk calls this group the "Rough Bunch" on more than one occasion. The time-lost heroes [[Steel (comics)|Steel]], Supergirl, Guy Gardner and a version of [[Batgirl]] show up to help in the fight.

A modern-day version of the character appears in the Western-themed ''Robin Annual'' #6,<ref>''Robin Annual'' #6 (1997).</ref> as a mercenary. He worked with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and the modern day [[Pow Wow Smith]] to track down the modern day [[Trigger Twins]]. They have a literal Main Street showdown in a Western-themed tourist attraction located near [[Gotham City]].

== Other media ==
He was slated to be a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'', but did not make the final release.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/830/830948p1.html |title=New LEGO Batman Characters Revealed - Wii News at IGN |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>

French-Canadian electro-rock band [[Judge Rock]] has him as a character in their 2012 song ''Westerner'', depicting scenes from ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' where Nighthawk appears: "Then came Nighthawk, the sombre man,
White bird on a dark shirt,
Hand on his gun, boots in the dirt,
He was the gravest of the clan."
