'''Nighthawk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  His real name is '''Hannibal Hawkes''' and he first appeared in ''Western Comics'' # 5. In his [[secret identity]], he worked as a travelling repairman. He had a [[sidekick]] named Jim Peyton.

He was shown as dying during ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', although this has been [[retcon]]ned twice to fit in with the later revelation that he was a [[reincarnation]] of Prince Khufu -- who would later be reincarnated as [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]], the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Hawkman]]. Current continuity has it that he was shot by a criminal named Matilda Roderic, who was presumably a reincarnation of the evil priest [[Hath-Set]], who is apparently destined to kill Khufu in every life. Roderic's descendant is the current Hath-Set.

The Hawkman retcon also revealed he was the partner and lover of the Western heroine [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]], who was the reincarnation of Khufu's wife [[Hawkgirl#Shiera Sanders|Chay-Ara]].

Nighthawk appears in [[Guy_Gardner_(comics)|Guy Gardner]] #24 during the [[Zero Hour]] incident. He sported white sideburns at this point in time. His group of allies, which includes El Diablo and [[Bat-Lash]], were forming to take on the villain Extant and several men Extant had brainwashed. Nighthawk calls this group the 'Rough Bunch' on more than one occasion. The time-lost heroes [[Steel (comics)|Steel]], Supergirl, Guy Gardner and a version of [[Batgirl]] show up to help in the fight.

A modern-day version of the character appears in the Western-themed ''Robin Annual'' # 6, as a mercenary. He worked with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and the modern day [[Pow Wow Smith]] to track down the modern day [[Trigger Twins]]. They have a literal main-street showdown in a western themed tourist attraction located near Gotham City.
