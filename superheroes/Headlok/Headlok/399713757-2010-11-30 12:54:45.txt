==Fictional character biography==
This mysterious menace found the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]] roaming the [[Adirondack Mountains]], and used his mental powers to enslave the Griffin.  Headlok tricked the [[Avengers (comics)|West Coast Avengers]] by claiming to have spotted [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] whom the team was looking for. Headlok ambushed them with the Griffin and attempted to take over their minds one by one. The Avenger [[Tigra]] was able to calm the Griffin's rage. It turns out the Thing had indeed been nearby and he joins the battle. Headlok, not knowing this, had not been using his powers to hide himself from sight or mentally influence Ben Grimm and thus was taken by surprise. With the help of the Avengers, Headlok was swiftly defeated.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Alpha Flight and the [[Fantastic Four]] later contended against Headlok.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #93-96</ref> Headlok mentally manipulated [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], causing her to revert to her original split personality, and she then apparently killed Headlok.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #102-104</ref> However, he later reappeared as a prisoner.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #55-63</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Headlok can psionically control or influence the minds of other beings. He can mentally enslave people or alter their perception, such as making them believe he is standing in an area he is not actually in. 

Sufficient concentration and willpower allows an individual to see through this illusion. If the intended victim knows Headlok plans to use his enslaving ability, his power can be resisted.

Mind Control: Headlok possesses the ability to control minds. He can mentally enslave only one individual at a time, as such domination requires a large amount of concentration on Headlok's part. Headlok can induce hallucinations and cast illusions against an unlimited number of targets as long as he has already gained control of their minds. Victims who are aware of Headlok's power were more likely to break his hold.
