The '''Royal Flush Gang''' or '''RFG''' are [[fictional character]]s in [[DC Comics]]. They first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #43 in March 1966 under the leadership of Professor [[Amos Fortune (comics)|Amos Fortune]].

==History==
They are a group of [[playing card]]-themed [[supervillain]]s who are usually thwarted by the [[superhero]]es they encounter. They have code names based on a royal flush in [[poker]] [[i.e.]] Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten.

===First Gang: Clubs===

[[Image:Firstrfgang.png|left|thumb|120px|The first Royal Flush Gang, [[Mike Sekowsky]]]]

The original Royal Flush Gang was Professor Amos Fortune's childhood gang. With Fortune himself as Ace, they fought the Justice League on two occasions, using Fortune's luck-altering "stellaration" technology to realize the fortune-telling significance of playing cards.  After Fortune abandoned the Gang, they attempted to steal paintings containing clues to a hidden treasure but were thwarted by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker's]] manipulations (''Joker'' #5).  Most of them then abandoned their criminal careers, although Jack briefly joined the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] as "'''Hi-Jack'''".  Fortune's gang wore costumes based on the suit of clubs.
In the pages of ''JLA Classified'', it was revealed the original Royal Flush Gang (sans Amos Fortune) reunited to fight the "[[Justice League Detroit|Detroit Era]]" Justice League and their successors in the second gang. In this battle, the original King, Queen, and Ten were all killed.

===Second Gang: Spades===
The second Royal Flush Gang was set up by [[Green Lantern]] villain [[Hector Hammond]] in ''Justice League of America'' #203. Hammond led the group as "Wildcard". This version wore costumes based on the suit of spades.  The gang split up and went on to have separate criminal careers before re-establishing themselves, without Hammond.  They were twice hired by [[Maxwell Lord]] as part of his manipulation of [[Justice League International]].  Later, they were reorganized and reoutfitted by a successor to the [[Alan Scott|Golden Age Green Lantern]] villain [[Gambler (comics)|the Gambler]], who was masquerading as the Joker.

* '''King''' (Joe Carny) --  The so-called "King of the Hoboes," Carny also suffered from [[lung cancer]].  As Hammond's agent, he wore a costume that technologically enhanced his natural [[charisma]] to the point of [[mind control]].  Following the metagene bomb in ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]'' King became immortal. Although King is the highest ranking member of the gang, in poker the Ace ranks as the highest card in a royal flush.
* '''Queen''' (Mona Taylor) - Taylor was originally a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star whose career was destroyed by her ongoing [[alcoholism]].  As Hammond's agent, she wielded a sceptre that cast realistic illusions.  After the Gambler reoutiftted the team, she began employing a wrist shooter that fires razor sharp spades.
* '''Jack''' (name unknown) - Originally a [[male prostitution|gigolo]], he became a fugitive after inadvertently killing a client while attempting to steal her jewelry.  As Hammond's agent, he wielded an energy-charged sword.  The Gambler replaced his left eye with a cybernetically-activated laser weapon, making him a literal "one-eyed Jack."  The removal of his eye to implant the laser initially impacted his sanity.
* '''Ten''' (Wanda Wayland) - Wayland was a test pilot fired for refusing her employer's sexual advances.  As Hammond's agent, she wore a costume with energy blasters in its gloves. She has enhanced reflexes, and carries explosive playing cards.
* '''Ace''' ("Derek Reston") - The Ace was a superstrong android in the form of an African-American man.  A later Ace, '''Ernie Clay''', was recruited by King and used a strength-enhancing exoskeleton provided by the Gambler.  In more recent appearances in ''Starman'' and ''Infinite Crisis,'' however, the team was once again employing the robot Ace.

King, Queen, and Ten also have blaster-pistols. The Gang fly on hovering playing cards. In the Gang's appearances in ''[[Teen Titans]]'', Ten had organized runaways as "Ten's Little Indians," a gang of thieves dressed as the two through nine of spades and armed with bows and trick arrows.

===Third Gang: All Suits===
''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #121 revealed that the Royal Flush Gang had expanded. The Royal Flush Gang is now an organization that reaches across America, with cells in every major city. Instead of five members, each "cell" has fifty-two, split into four suits run by the "court cards". Each member has a playing card value, and those who rise or fall in the Gang's esteem gain or lose a "pip". Notably, [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]]'s father was a "Two"; upon defeating him, she transitioned from the Star-Spangled Kid identity to Stargirl in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]: All-Stars.''

Recently, in ''[[Infinite Crisis]] #2'', [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] tortures and kills the leadership of a local cell of the Royal Flush Gang from an unspecified city, after being rejected by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]] for his "instability". The King is the last one left alive and he mocks the Joker for being rejected. He kills the King with an electrical blast to the face. The dead gang is left in the ruins of a casino. However, given the fact that King is immortal, to the point that he has recovered from death almost instantly on numerous occasions, it seems improbable that he actually ''permanently'' died.

Another cell of the expanded version, this one stylized as a street gang, appear as members of the Society in ''[[Villains United]]'' and several of its tie-ins in other comics. It is unclear what ties the third gang has or had—if any—to its predecessors and successors.

===Post-Crisis Gang===
A new version of the Royal Flush Gang appears in ''Justice League of America'' (volume 2) #35. This version is working under the authority of Amos Fortune, who is addressed by other members as "Wild Card". In the following issue, Fortune gives a history of the gang. It seems to combine the first and third gangs' histories/characteristics, with Fortune indicating that he was always running the group in some capacity.

Currently, there are multiple active, costumed members, some of whom deriving their outfits and codenames from cards with [[pips|pip values]] lower than ten. Members can raise in the numerical ranks as reward for their successes, or be "dealt out" at the discretion of Wild Card.

It is unclear if there are still 52 cells throughout the country, or 52 members in total. A lower ranked member mentions that there are four Queens, but Fortune states that the group is constantly growing.

A branch of the Royal Flush Gang based in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] recently appeared in ''[[Zatanna]]'' # 4. Rather than using a playing card motif, each member of the Vegas branch is modeled after a member of the [[Rat Pack]] (such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and [[Dean Martin]]).

==Other versions==
===Elseworlds===
In the miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], King is a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s Mankind Liberation Front. He apparently has gone separate from the Gang, but carries a cigarette pack with playing card markings and speaks in metaphors drawn from card games. There is also a man in the Justice League's prison who appears to be a new version of the Ace of Spades. According to the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] novelization, King is also newly immortal, and [[Vandal Savage]]'s protege.

===JLA/Avengers===
In the crossover series ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', the group appears as lackeys of [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] who attack [[Green Arrow]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. King is shown being defeated by [[Jack of Hearts]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* In ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', the Royal Flush Gang is seen in the episode "The Wild Cards". They are a quartet of thieves recruited by the mysterious Ace (here not an android). Ace is revealed to not only be in league with [[Darkseid]], but also to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise, as deduced by Batman upon realizing that the Joker's [[house of cards]] was missing his [[Joker (playing card)|namesake card]]. By the end of the episode, Ten (who feels in over her head) switches sides and the rest of the gang and Joker are captured.

* The Royal Flush gang is prominent in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. They appear as recurring foes in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' series, where the new Batman repeatedly faces a future version of the gang. They use various high-tech weapons with a playing card theme, per their name. The Walker parents are '''King''' (voiced by [[George Lazenby]]) and '''Queen''' (voiced by [[Amanda Donohoe]] and later by [[Sarah Douglas]]). Their two children are their son '''Jack''' (voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]] and later by [[Nicholas Guest]]) and daughter Melanie (voiced by [[Olivia d'Abo]]), who takes the role of '''Ten'''. '''Ace''' is an android. This version of the gang resembles the group created by [[Hector Hammond]], down to their riding hovering playing cards and Ace being an android. It is suggested that crime runs in the family: in the episode "King's Ransom", it is revealed that the former King was the father of the current Queen, with each new generation forming a new version or branch of the gang. In their first appearance, King wanted to come back to Gotham to get revenge on Batman for humiliating and breaking up the previous gang. This causes the beginning of the downfall of this gang. He doesn't know that the Batman isn't the same Batman, but a new Batman. Melanie Walker/Ten was also a romantic interest for [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], creating much the same conflict as existed between the original Batman and [[Catwoman]], so much so that Bruce Wayne mentions the relationship. Melanie leaves the gang after their first appearance. This gang's activities are ended in their third appearance when Ace is destroyed and King is revealed to have been having an affair with Paxton Powers' secretary Sable Thorpe (he claimed he was fed up with living in his predecessor's shadow). The family is arrested, but Jack is bailed out by his sister and takes an honest job at the same restaurant where she works.

* The Royal Flush Gang's DCAU origin is depicted in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and it appears once in the follow-up series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The first incarnation of the gang, which appears in the two-part episode ''Wild Cards'', is a group of government-trained teenagers found and given their theme by the Joker (playing on the fact that the '''Joker''' is also a card in a deck). '''Ace''' (voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]) can create illusions, and drive people insane just by looking at them, even through video broadcasts. '''King''' (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]) is able to create fire blasts. '''Queen''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) can manipulate metal. '''Jack''' (voiced by [[Greg Cipes]]) has a complete body elasticity. '''Ten''' (voiced by [[Khary Payton]]) has invulnerability and super strength (he feels no pain and appears to have strength comparable to that of Superman). The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] uses them to stage a reality show in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], serving as his muscle while the Justice League searches the city for explosives. This is revealed to be a ruse to draw viewership so Ace could drive every viewer insane. The plan fails when Batman pulls a collar from the Joker's jacket which was used to control her as a child and which Joker had kept as an insurance against her. In retaliation, Ace turns her powers on the Joker, driving him into [[catatonia]] for a time, and disappears. King, Ten, and Jack are captured, but as for Queen, she was knocked out during a fight with the [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] and [[Hawkgirl]], and apparently perished when the bomb inside the building they were in detonated. It is interesting to note that this Royal Flush Gang shares all of its voice actors with the title characters of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.

* Another incarnation of the gang, created by Ace, appears in a flashback in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Epilogue", which is itself set 65 years into the future. Ace's powers evolved to the point where she could warp reality, so she granted powers to random people in an attempt to make friends, only to have them ditch her and use their powers for crime. [[Amanda Waller]] stated that this was the second or third generation of the gang; she can't remember which (this is a reference to this being the third Royal Flush Gang in production terms, but the second in chronological order of the DCAU). All of the new members of the gang were various puns, based partially on their names; '''King''' appeared to be a massive head with small limbs that flew on a throne and fired beams from his eyes (an homage to the [[Marvel Comics]] villain [[MODOK]] who has been called the "The King of Comic Book Characters"). '''Queen''' is a large transvestite (in reference to the phrase "[[drag queen]]") with enhanced strength, whose design was based on a cross between the famous drag queen [[Divine (actor)|Divine]] and the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] from [[Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. '''Jack''' is an African-American [[Samurai]]-styled warrior (a reference to the Cartoon Network series, "[[Samurai Jack]]"). '''Ten''' is a beautiful woman with long, extensible [[cornrows]] she could use like a whip (modelled on [[Bo Derek]]'s appearance in the movie ''[[10 (film)|10]]''). As the League battled the empowered criminals, Waller revealed that Ace was dying, and a possible psychic backlash caused by her death could kill millions. Batman volunteered to use a device to kill her before that could happen, but instead comforted Ace in her last moments, allowing her to die peacefully without harming anyone. Ace's warped reality, and the criminals empowered by it, returned to normal upon her death. It is implied that Bruce named the ''Batman Beyond'' version of [[Ace the Bat-Hound]] after this Ace.

* The Royal Flush Gang appear in the teaser of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Return of the Fearsome Fangs" with Ace voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]] and Jack voiced by [[Edoardo Ballerini]]. '''King''' and '''Queen''' are also present but there is no evidence of '''Ten'''. '''Jack''' speaks [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and '''Ace''' is the leader. This version of the gang is reimagined as a gang of bandits in the Old West and fight [[Jonah Hex]] and had the diamond insignia on their outfits. The opening scene has Jonah Hex caught and the Royal Flush Gang planning to tear him apart with scattering horses. Batman frees him and the two apprehend the Royal Flush Gang. In "The Siege of Starro" Pt. 1, the Royal Flush Gang are featured in the opening narration, attempting to rob a bank. However, they are stopped by Jonah Hex and [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]].

* The Royal Flush Gang appears in the episode "Legacies" of ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. Here the gang is a family of bank robbers who wear [[Goaltender mask|hockey masks]] with their respective playing card. It's later revealed that the leader Derek Reston worked for Queen Industries before Robert Queen outsourced 1500 jobs to China and the Reston family lost their home as a result. Feeling guilty, Oliver tries to persuade Derek to right his own wrongs, but when he learns that the family are going to rob another bank he chooses to stop them. During Oliver's confrontation, Derek is shot and killed, and the rest of the family is arrested. '''King''' is portrayed by [[Currie Graham]], '''Ace''' is portrayed by [[Kyle Schmid]], '''Jack''' is portrayed by [[Tom Stevens]] and '''Queen''' is portrayed by [[Sarah-Jane Redmond]], There is no evidence of '''Ten''' in this version.<ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/GraphicCity/news/?a=67296</ref>

===Film===
* The Royal Flush Gang appears in ''[[Justice League: Doom]]''<ref>http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=1135</ref> with '''King''' voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]], '''Queen''' voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], '''Jack''' voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]], '''Ace''' voiced by [[Bruce Timm]], and '''Ten''' voiced by [[Juliet Landau]]. They are mainly used as a plot device rather than main antagonists and appear to have no direct connection to [[Vandal Savage]]'s [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]]. They attempt to rob a bank using technology that allows them to walk through walls, but are halted by the arrival of Batman, who was tipped off by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] about their robberies. Alone and outnumbered, the Gang manage to overcome the Dark Knight, but after the remainder of the Justice League arrive they quickly begin to fall; Queen is overpowered by [[Wonder Woman]], Ten is taken out by [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], Jack is captured by Batman and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], Ace is destroyed by [[Superman]], and King is defeated by Cyborg. The tech they used is revealed to have been supplied by Vandal Savage to test it for his own plans, and the battle itself may have been simply a diversion for [[Mirror Master]] to infiltrate the [[Batcave]].

===Miscellaneous===
* The Old West version of the Royal Flush Gang appears in issue 6 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comics.
