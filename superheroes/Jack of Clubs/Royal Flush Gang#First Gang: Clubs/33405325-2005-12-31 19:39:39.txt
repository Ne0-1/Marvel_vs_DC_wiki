'''The Royal Flush Gang''' are [[fictional characters]] in [[DC comics]]. First appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #43 in March [[1966]] as the gang of Professor [[Amos Fortune]].  They are a group of [[playing card]] themed villains who are usually thwarted by whatever [[superhero]]es they encounter. They have code names based on a [[royal flush]] in [[poker (game)|poker]] i.e. Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten.

The original Royal Flush Gang was Professor Fortune's childhood gang. With Fortune himself as Ace, they fought the Justice League on two occasions. Most of them then abandoned their criminal careers, although Jack joined the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] as "Hi-Jack". Fortune's gang wore costumes based on the suit of clubs.

The second Royal Flush Gang was set up by [[Green Lantern]] villain [[Hector Hammond]] in ''Justice League of America'' #203. Hammond led the group as "Wildcard". This version wore costumes based on the suit of spades. The gang split up and went on to have separate criminal careers before re-establishing themselves, without Hammond. They were twice hired by [[Maxwell Lord]] as part of his manipulation of Justice League International.

*King - Real name Joe Carny. Following the metagene bomb in ''[[Invasion (comics)|Invasion!]]'' King became immortal.
*Queen - Has a wrist shooter that fires razor sharp spades. 
*Jack - Can fire energy blasts from a device that replaces his left eye (a one-eyed Jack).
*Ten - Has enhanced reflexes, and carries explosive playing cards
*Ace - A superstrong android.

King, Queen and Ten also have blaster-pistols. The Gang fly on hovering playing cards.

''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #121 revealed that the Royal Flush Gang had expanded. The Royal Flush Gang is now an organisation that reaches across America. Instead of five members, each "cell" has fifty-two, split into four suits run by the "court cards". Each members has a playing card value, and those who rise or fall in the Gang's esteem gain or lose a "pip".

In [[Mark Waid]]'s epic miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'', King is a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s Mankind Liberation Front. He apparently has gone separate from the Gang, but carries a cigarette pack with playing card markings.

Recently, in ''[[Infinite Crisis]] #2'', [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] tortured the Royal Flush Gang after being rejected by the [[Secret Society of Supervillains|Society]] for his "instability." He seemingly killed the Gang without a laugh. 

==Other Media==
The Royal Flush Gang have also appeared in other media including the ''[[Superfriends]]'', ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', and ''[[Justice League]]''.  According to the ''Justice League'' episode, "Wild Cards," the original Royal Flush Gang were orphans born with superpowers in a government project to use them as human weapons. The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] freed them and they pledged their allegiance to him.

*Ace - Can create illusions, and drive people insane just by looking at them.  Later, her powers developed into the ability to actually alter reality.  
*King - Can shoot fire.
*Queen - Can control metal.
*Jack - Can stretch his limbs.
*Ten - Can't feel pain and has super strength.

Two other versions of this gang were seen in the animated continuity.  In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]", Ace creates a new version of the gang to have friends to play with.  

*King -- Appeared to be a massive head with small limbs (similar to the [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain, [[M.O.D.O.K.]], created by Jack "The King" Kirby).  Flew on a throne and fired beams from his eyes.
*Queen -- A large woman with enhanced strength.  Turned out to actually be a man (a play on [[Drag queen]]).  
*Jack -- A [[Samurai]]-styled warrior.  A play on the series [[Samurai Jack]].  
*Ten -- A beautiful woman with long, extendable cornrows she could use like a whip.  A reference to [[Bo Derek]] in the movie [[10 (film)|"10"]].

Unfortunately, the people Ace empowered decided to go out and commit crimes instead.  As the League battled the Gang (minus Ace), [[Amanda Waller]] revealed that Ace was dying, and a possible psychic backlash caused by her death could kill millions.  Batman volunteered to use a device to kill her before that could happen.  Instead, he destroyed the device and stayed with Ace, comforting her until she passed away quietly.  With Ace gone, the remaining members of the gang lost their powers.  

In the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' series, the new Batman repeatedly faces a future version of the gang, who appear to be a family.  They all mostly used various high-tech weapons.  It should be noted that this version of the gang resembles the group created by Hector Hammond, down to the riding hovering playing cards and Ace being an android.  The family suggests that crime runs in the family, with each new generation forming a new version or branch of the gang.  The daughter, Ten, was also a romantic love interest for [[Terry McGinnis]], creating much the same conflict as existed between the original Batman and [[Catwoman]], so much so that Bruce Wayne mentions the relationship.
