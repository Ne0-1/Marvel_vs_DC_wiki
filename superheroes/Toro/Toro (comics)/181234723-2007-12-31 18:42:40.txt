'''Toro''' ('''Thomas Raymond''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] from the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]].  His first appearance was in ''Human Torch Comics'' #2 (premiering fall 1940 with no cover date and as issue #2, having taken over the numbering from the single-issue ''Red Raven''). <!--see entry for Carl Burgos-->

==Fictional character biography==
Thomas Raymond was born in [[New York City]].  He was a protégé and partner of the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] and a co-founder of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]].  

Years later, Toro was killed in battle with the [[Mad Thinker]]<ref>''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]]'' #14 (1969)</ref> destroying the Thinker's laboratory in the process.

==Powers and abilities==
Toro is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose superhuman abilities are similar to that of the Human Torch (the ability to fly and burst into flames, as well as flame resistance), except that Toro's are thought to be caused by a possible [[mutation]] as a result of his parents' exposure to radiation prior to his conception, making him a genetic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]].

One additional power exhibited by Toro was that of rapid healing, which he demonstrated only once when he fully healed from heart surgery within minutes.  On many other occasions, Toro has been injured (less grievously) and shown no enhanced healing ability.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

==Other versions==
===Counter-Earth===
A second Marvel character, Benito Serrano, is also called Toro. He is a member of the [[Young Allies]] of [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], who can transform into a super-strong [[Minotaur]]-like humanoid ("toro" means "bull in Spanish).{{Fact|date=November 2007}}
