Thomas "'''Toro'''" Raymond is a [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] from the [[1940's]] and [[1950's]].  He was a protege of the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Original Human Torch]] and a co-founder of [[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]].  

Toro's superhuman abilities are similar to that of the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]] (the ability to fly and burst into flames, as well as flame resistance), except that Toro's are caused by a possible mutation either as a result of his parents' exposure to radiation prior to his conception or because he was a genetic [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]].  His first appearance was in ''Human Torch Comics'' #2 (premiering fall 1940 with no cover date and as issue #2, having taken over the numbering from the single-issue ''Red Raven''). <!--see entry for Carl Burgos-->
