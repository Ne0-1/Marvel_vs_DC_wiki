Thomas "'''Toro'''" Raymond is a [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] from the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]].  He was a protege of the original [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]] and a co-founder of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]].  

Toro's superhuman abilities are similar to that of the Human Torch (the ability to fly and burst into flames, as well as flame resistance), except that Toro's are caused by a possible mutation either as a result of his parents' exposure to radiation prior to his conception or because he was a genetic [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]].  His first appearance was in ''Human Torch Comics'' #2 (premiering fall 1940 with no cover date and as issue #2, having taken over the numbering from the single-issue ''Red Raven''). <!--see entry for Carl Burgos-->

==Note==
A second Marvel character, Benito Serrano, is also called Toro. He is a member of the [[Young Allies]] of [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], who can transform into a super-strong [[Minotaur]]-like humanoid.
