"'''For the Man Who Has Everything'''" is a [[comic book]] story by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], first published in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985) and later adapted into a [[For the Man Who Has Everything (Justice League Unlimited episode)|''Justice League Unlimited'' episode]] in 2004.

==Plot==
[[Batman]], [[Jason Todd|Robin]], and [[Wonder Woman]] visit the [[Fortress of Solitude]] on [[Superman]]'s birthday, only to find him in a vegetative state, a large alien plant stuck to his chest, its tendrils wrapped around his body. As they analyze the situation, the alien [[Mongul]] steps into the scene, revealing the name of the plant (the "Black Mercy") and how it has put Superman into a coma, feeding him an extremely realistic and plausible dream based on his "heart's desire". As he explains, Mongul touches the Mercy while wearing a pair of protective, oversized gauntlets. Interspersed with the scenes in the Fortress are pages of Superman's dream of living a normal life on his long-destroyed home planet of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], happily married with two children.

While Wonder Woman battles Mongul, whose power is shown to exceed hers, Batman and Robin try to free Superman. Superman's fantasy, meantime, takes a dark turn. His father [[Jor-El]]'s prediction of Krypton's doom was unfulfilled in the fantasy, leading to Jor-El being discredited and embittered. The Kryptonian society within the dream is undergoing political upheaval, with Jor-El becoming chairman of an extremist reactionary movement called the "Sword of Rao" which calls for a return to Krypton's "noble and unspoiled" past. A major point of contention in the political struggle is the use of the [[Phantom Zone]], Krypton's other-dimensional prison system, developed by Jor-El and thus making the House of El unpopular with the public. Kal-El's cousin, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], is brutally assaulted by anti-Zone protesters, who use the criminal [[Jax-Ur]] as martyr and symbol.

Superman gradually begins to wake up from the increasingly disturbing dream, with it finally dissolving with a scene of his "son", Van-El, slipping away from him. In combination, Batman has resorted to trying to pry the Mercy off Superman's chest. Without protective clothing, the plant immediately attacks him, submerging Batman into his own "heart's desire" dream, in which the murder of his parents is foiled and he instead grows into a contented adulthood with a wife ([[Kathy Kane]]) and daughter. Superman, infuriated by both the Mercy's attack and the loss of the fantasy (as Mongul later describes, "''escaping it must have been like tearing off your own arm''"), savagely attacks Mongul, who was about to finish off the defeated Wonder Woman. The two adversaries battle across the Fortress, causing massive damage to it.

Robin, anxiously seeking a solution, puts on Mongul's discarded gauntlets and pries the Mercy off of Batman. Thinking quickly, he stuffs the Mercy into one of the gauntlets, allowing him to safely carry it to the battle. Superman, on the verge of delivering a crushing blow to Mongul, becomes distracted by the sight of the statues of his parents, allowing Mongul to deliver a stunning counterattack. Mongul is on the verge of killing Superman when Robin drops the Mercy on him. Mongul is instantly seized by the plant and submerged into his own deepest fantasy, in which he swats the Mercy aside, kills Robin and then Superman, and then conquers the universe.

==Outside references==
As in such other Moore/Gibbons projects as ''[[Watchmen]]'', "For the Man Who Has Everything" is rich in detail, showcasing many of the minor elements drawn from Kryptonian history. The final page, detailing Mongul's universal conquest fantasy, includes appearances by numerous extraterrestrial DC characters including [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] and [[Hawkwoman]]; Brainiac; [[Adam Strange]]; [[Hyathis]] (empress of [[Thanagar]]); Bolphunga the Unrelenting (from a story in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #188, May 1985, also by Moore and Gibbons); an Oan [[Guardians of the Universe|Guardian]]; J'onn J'onnz ([[the Martian Manhunter]]); and a bearded long-haired human representing Alan Moore himself bowing, among others. The fantasy also incorporates "a resurrected [[Warworld]]", a copy of the planet-sized battle station used by Mongul but destroyed by Superman and Supergirl in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #28 (Dec 1980).

The 2005 comic ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' featured two references to "For The Man Who Has Everything". In ''Infinite Crisis'' #1, a panel showing Mongul Jr. confronting Batman and Wonder Woman at the remains of the Watchtower uses the same composition as Mongul's entrance in the earlier story. Later, in a tie-in story in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 4) #7 and 8, Mongul Jr. uses a Black Mercy to capture [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] (Hal Jordan) and [[Green Arrow]] (Oliver Queen). Queen is able to break free because Jordan's greater willpower allows his desires to override his fantasy and describe what he thinks Queen's perfect life would be, rather than what Queen himself would wish for.

Since then, the Black Mercy has been given an origin tale in the ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'' title{{issue|date=November 2008}} and [[List_of_Green_Lanterns#Mother_Mercy|Mother Mercy]] (which birthed the Black Mercy) is now a Green Lantern of Sector 2261.

In the ''[[JLA: Destiny]]'' Elseworlds mini-series, a mysterious figure named Khouriga Edjem has turned a fictional Middle Eastern country Kamburu into a modern day Eden. It is revealed through the course of the miniseries that Edjem is in fact Mongul who has come to Earth to conquer it. He used a Black Mercy on Green Lantern Guy Gardner to incapacitate him and use him as a power source for the entire country of Kamburu.

==Animated episode==
The story was adapted for the second episode of the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In this version, Robin does not appear and most of his lines are given to Wonder Woman. The Lyla character is renamed "Loana" and is an amalgam of both [[Lois Lane]] and [[Lana Lang]], the two main loves of Clark Kent's life. Loana is voiced by [[Dana Delany]], who provided the voice of Lois Lane in the earlier series, ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', as well as throughout ''Justice League Unlimited''. Also, Superman's 'dream' does not turn negative, instead a series of discrepancies (including Jor'el speaking in Pa Kent's voice) causes Kal-el to realize what is happening and break free on his own. Also, Batman's fantasy consists only of his father disarming and beating Joe Chill during his mugging, which becomes progresively more violent and barbaric as Batman realizes its false nature. In the end, Mongul's fantasy of conquest is not shown, and instead represented with a soundtrack of screams and explosions as the camera zooms in on his face.

[[J. M. DeMatteis]] adapted the script from the Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons story; they are given credit at the beginning of the episode. DeMatteis: "''I don't think he'd be happier on Krypton. It's just that Superman never really knew Krypton and had a profound longing to experience that part of his history. Krypton is part of him but Earth, I think, is a bigger part.''"{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
