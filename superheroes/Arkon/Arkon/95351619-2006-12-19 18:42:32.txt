'''Arkon''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. He is the warlord and ruler of the extradimensional world of Polemachus.

== Biography ==
Arkon was born of noble lineage on the extradimensional world Polemachus. The people of Polemachus developed a culture that glorifies [[war]]fare, and Arkon succeeded in becoming the greatest warrior of his people. Appointed Imperion of the largest country on Polemachus, Arkon mounted [[military campaign]]s against neighboring countries in an effort to conquer the world. His dreams were forgotten when Polemachus was faced with a world-wide catastrophe in that the light-and heat-providing planetary rings were disintegrating. Arkon's [[scientist]]s determined that atomic explosions occurring on Earth somehow were extradimensionally translated to rekindle the energy rings for about a year. Although Polemachus had not developed [[nuclear weaponry]], the scientists predicted that if they were to atomically annihilate the Earth, their world's energy-rings would be restored to power.

Toward this goal, Arkon manipulated the hero known as the [[Scarlet Witch]] into reciting a [[Magic (paranormal)|magical spell]] found in a Polemachian book to enable Arkon to transport himself to Earth. Attracted to the Scarlet Witch, Arkon kidnapped her as well as a group of atomic scientists. The scientists used to construct an atomic device. Before Arkon could detonate it on Earth, however, Scarlet Witch's super team, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], managed to rekindle Polemachus' energy-rings. Arkon then ceased hostilities with Earth.

The Avengers had cause to revisit Arkon's world when their comrade, the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], was taken captive by Arkon while searching for the Well at the Center of Time. Arkon ceased hostiliites with the Avengers when he learned that he was being duped by the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora the Enchantress]].

Although his world now possessed the capacity for [[atomic power]], Arkon was dissatisfied with the length of time it took to build a [[nuclear arsenal]]. Thus, he devised a plan to pit three extradimensional worlds, one of which was Earth, against one another, in hopes that the energy from the resultant nuclear conflagration could be absorbed by his world. His elaborate machinations failed, due to the efforts of the [[Fantastic Four]].

Arkon was forced to return to Earth yet again when the machine that [[Iron Man]] had once built to rekindle Polemachus' rings failed due to Arkon's tinkering with it. Arkon traveled to Earth to recruit [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to recharge the machine, but he settled for the [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[X-Men|X-Man]] known as [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], who also had the ability to summon lightning, forcing her teammates to go after them. After a monumental struggle, the misunderstanding was settled, Storm agreed to help, and Arkon returned Storm and her allies to Earth. Another time, the X-Men and the [[Fantastic Four]] helped Arkon drive off an extradimensional invasion of Polemachus by the alien race of [[Badoon]].

Some time later, Arkon traveled to Earth to employ the Avengers and Fantastic Four as pawns in his war with rival otherworldly monarch [[Thundra]], until he made peace with Thundra after realizing they shared a strong mutual attraction. Later, with consort Thundra, Arkon sought Avengers' aid in repairing Polemachus's energy ring and protecting the maiden Astra from becoming a human sacrifice to Polemachus' religious zealots led by the high priest Anskar.

Arkon also had a rival in his Grand Vizier, who, over time, convinced Arkon to return Polemachus to a more barbaric lifestyle rather than rely on its science. The Grand Vizier then abducted the superhero and Avenger [[Monica Rambeau|Photon (Monica Rambeau)]] along with the supervillains battling her at the time, the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]. The Grand Vizier used the Wrecking Crew to depose of Arkon and Thundra, until the Avengers arrived to rescue their teammate and restore Arkon to the throne. Polemachus returned to its hybrid barbaric/scientific lifestyles.

Arkon, Thundra, and all of Polemachus were last seen being wiped out by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] during the ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' crossover miniseries. However, since this took place in an inter-company crossover
story, Arkon, Thundra, and Polemachus itself may have all been restored to normal when the miniseries ended
