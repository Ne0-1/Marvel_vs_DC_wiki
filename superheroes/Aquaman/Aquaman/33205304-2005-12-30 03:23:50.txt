'''Aquaman''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Paul Norris]] and [[Mort Weisinger]], he first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #73 (1941). 

Like [[Marvel Comics]]&#8217; [[Sub-Mariner]], Aquaman is an undersea hero originating from the [[myth|mythical]] kingdom of [[Atlantis]]. In the traditional version of his origin, he was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a human [[lighthouse]] keeper, and Atlanna, an outcast from [[Atlantis]].  Recent comics, however, depict Aquaman as an [[orphan]] of purely underwater heritage who was raised for a brief period of time by a lighthouse keeper named Arthur Curry. In either case, Arthur eventually learned about his origins and powers, and vowed to defend the Earth's oceans and its inhabitants.

Aquaman's most noteworthy powers are his ability to breathe underwater, communicate (via [[telepathy]]) with and issue commands to all forms of sea life , and swim at fast speeds. In some depictions, Aquaman also possesses limited degrees of superstrength and invulnerability, sometimes said to derive from his ability to withstand the high pressures found in the depths of the ocean, and his telepathy has occasionally been depicted as working on land creatures including humans, albeit to a greatly reduced degree.

Aquaman was a minor but durable hero during the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Ages]] of [[comic books]], appearing in short adventures featuring other superheroes or in a supporting role to them.  He eventually became a founding member of the all-star [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

Aquaman's personality was traditionally that of a fairly amiable and friendly person. However, recent comics have usually portrayed Aquaman as a surly and hot-headed anti-hero.

A noteworthy aspect of the 1950s and 1960s Aquaman comics was that the primary artist for his adventures was [[Ramona Fradon]], one of the few women superhero comic artists of the period.

Aquaman is often criticized by some in comics [[fandom]] for having limited superhuman abilities (more emphasis has been placed on his super strength and stamina in recent years over his telepathy with aquatic life). However, he also has his fair share of vehement fans.

==History==
===Golden Age Aquaman===
In his [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] appearances, as seen in his first appearance in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #73 (November 1941), Aquaman was presented as the son of a human scientist who gave him the ability to survive and breathe underwater, but had no other powers whatsoever.

This version of Aquaman was, in later years (after the establishment of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]]) described as being the Aquaman of [[Earth-Two]], an alternate [[Earth]]. The only appearances of the Golden Age/Earth-Two version of Aquaman after the Golden Age were in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #59 and #60, just before he was [[retroactive|retroactively]] eliminated from existence due to the changes wrought to DC's history by 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

In 1946, Aquaman's adventures moved from ''More Fun Comics'' to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'', where he remained through the rest of the 1940s, the 1950s and early 1960s as a backup feature to the book's star, [[Superboy]].

Most of Aquaman's adventures in the 1940s and 1950s consisted of Aquaman dealing with various criminals, [[pirate]]s, and so forth, as well as threats to aquatic life and sailors. The first recurring supporting character Aquaman gained was Topo, his pet [[octopus]], in ''Adventure Comics'' #229 in October 1956.

===Silver Age Aquaman===
[[Image:Aquamanfamily.jpg|thumb|right|Aquaman, Aqualad and Mera, as they were depicted circa the 1970s. Art by [[Jim Aparo]].]]
Starting in 1959, Aquaman saw his first major revisions to his mythos since the Golden Age, with various new supporting characters and adjustments made to to the character.

In ''Adventure Comics'' #260 and subsequent Silver Age comics, it was revealed that Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of a human [[lighthouse]] keeper named Tom Curry and his mother Atlanna, an outcast from the lost continent of [[Atlantis]]. Due to this heritage, Aquaman soon discovered as a youth that he possessed various aquatic abilities, including the ability to survive underwater, communicate with sea life, and tremendous swimming abilities. Eventually, Arthur decided to use his talents to become the defender of the Earth's oceans and its inhabitants, starting a career as "Aquaboy." As Aquaboy, he eventually met [[Superboy]] (Earth's only other superpowered superhero at the time) on one occasion (''Superboy'' (volume 1) #171). Eventually, Arthur grew up and changed his name to "Aquaman."

In 1960, Aquaman became included in the ''[[Justice League of America]]'' comic, appearing with the team in its very first appearance in ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #28, and later revealed to be a founding member (as shown in [[flashback]] in ''Justice League of America'' #9). Aquaman took part in most of the 1960s adventures of the superhero team.

Around this time, Aquaman also began gaining his familiar cast of allies and enemies, starting in ''Adventure Comics'' #269 (February 1960), which introduced [[Aqualad]], an outcast [[orphan]] youth from Atlantis whom Aquaman takes in.

Aquaman gained his own comic for the first time in 1962, which saw further additions to Aquaman's mythos, including the introduction of [[Mera]] (in ''Aquaman'' (volume 1) #11, September-October 1963), the queen of an aquatic world in another dimension; eventually, Mera and Aquaman became wed (in ''Aquaman'' (volume 1) #18, November-December 1964), with the two having a child together (named Arthur Jr. or "Aquababy").

The 1960s also saw the introduction of enemies such as [[Ocean Master]] and [[Black Manta]], would-be conquerors of the sea.

A noteworthy story of this era is ''Adventure Comics'' #452 (July-August 1977), in which Black Manta (as part of a trap) killed Aquaman's infant son.

In the early 1980s, Aquaman disbanded the Justice League, and reformed the team with a group of younger members, as well as relocating the team to headquarters in [[Detroit, Michigan]]; this new version of the team, however, proved short-lived, and was disbanded during the events of the 1986 miniseries ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]''.

===Modern Age Aquaman===
In 1986, following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', a four-issue Aquaman miniseries was published, featuring Aquaman in a new costume. The series failed to stir much interest, however, and was soon forgotten. In 1989, Aquaman received notice again with that year's ''[[The Legend of Aquaman]]'' special, which was soon followed by a five-issue miniseries. The following year saw the publication of ''[[The Atlantis Chronicles]]'', which revived interest in the character. In 1991, a 13-issue Aquaman comic was published.

In 1993, Aquaman received another miniseries, ''[[Aquaman: Time and Tide]]''; the four-issue miniseries delved into further details about Aquaman's origins.

In August 1994, Aquaman finally received his own comic again, initially scripted by [[Peter David]], who also penned ''Time and Tide''. This series ran for 75 issues; David left the series after nearly four years as ''Aquaman'' writer, and was replaced by [[Erik Larsen]] (with a brief stint by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]] bridging the two). Larsen's work did not prove popular, though, and he was soon replaced by [[Dan Jurgens]] as scripter, who saw the series through to its cancellation with #75.

In 2002, a new Aquaman series began publication, and is currently still being published by DC. Writers who have contibuted to the series thus far include [[Rick Veitch]], [[John Ostrander]], [[Will Pfeifer]] and [[John Arcudi]].

====Modern origin and background====
[[Image:Aquaman v3-69.jpg|thumb|right|The 1990s version of Aquaman, as rendered by [[Mike Kaluta]].]]
After the 1985 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', several miniseries in the late 1980s and early 1990s attempted to rewrite the Sea King's mythos and origin, though keeping most of his Silver Age history intact; the current version of Aquaman's origin and history is as follows:

Aquaman, born as Orin to Atlantis Queen Atlanna and the mysterious [[wizard]] Atlan, was abandoned on Mercy Reef as a baby because of his blonde hair, which was seen by the [[superstitious]] Atlanteans as a curse they called "the Mark of Kordax." The only one who spoke up on Orin's behalf was Vulko, a scientist who had no time for myth or superstition, and while his pleas had no effect, Vulko would later become a close friend and advisor of Orin's. Orin was found on the reef by [[dolphin]]s; one of the dolphins, named Porm, took Orin in and became his adopted mother. As a child, Orin was found and taken in by a [[lighthouse]] keeper who gave him his own name, Arthur Curry. One day Orin returned to the lighthouse and found Arthur gone, so he set off on his own. In his early teens, Orin ventured to the far north, where he met and fell in love with an [[Inupiat]] named Kako. He also first earned the hatred of Orm, the future [[Ocean Master]], who would prove to be his half-brother. He was driven away before he knew Kako had become pregnant with his son, [[Koryak]].

Orin returned to the seas; he crossed paths with humans from time to time but for the most part he stayed well out of the reach of humanity, until a fateful day when Orin happened on the city of his birth, Atlantis. He was captured by the then-dictatorial government of the city and placed in a prison camp. He was helped by Vulko, at the time also a prisoner of the state, who taught Orin the language and ways of the Atlanteans. While Orin was there he realized that his mother was also being held captive, but once she was killed he broke out and fled. Eventually, Orin made his way to the surface world, and became a hero named "Aquaman." From this point on, Aquaman's history mostly follows his Silver Age history outlined above, though with a few differences.

When Aquaman eventually returned to Atlantis, he found that the citizens had been inspired to free themselves by his daring escape and that Atlantis was now a free city. Aquaman was recognized as the son of Queen Atlanna and so he became the King of Atlantis. Aquaman began a policy of slowly reintroducing Atlantis to the surface world, though after being ousted by a villain named Shark, he decided to become a more traditional superhero, even though with Shark's defeat he could have ascended the throne again. Around this time, Arthur met and married Mera, a queen from another dimension, and they had a son, Arthur Jr.

Eventually, Aquaman's foe [[Black Manta]] kidnapped and ultimately murdered Arthur Jr., causing a rift between Aquaman and his wife. Mera had been driven insane by grief and was soon committed to an [[asylum]] in Poseidonis. Shortly afterwards, an alien force conquered Atlantis. Arthur was forced to save the day, and in the process was hampered by an escaped Mera who personally blamed Arthur for the death of their son. In a fit of rage, Mera left Aquaman's dimension. After Atlantis was freed, Arthur knew he had to remain in Atlantis, and thus he resigned from the Justice League. For a time, he served as Atlantis's representative to the [[United Nations]], but always found himself thrust back into the superhero role. Becoming more and more of a [[workaholic]] and solitary figure, Aquaman eventually returned to the oceans. He soon became tangled up in Black Manta's latest attempt at destroying Atlantis by dragging it into a war with a surface nation. In the aftermath of the war, Arthur received the Atlantis Chronicles, thus learning all about the history of his people and discovering that Ocean Master was really his half-brother, Orm. With all the chaos in his life, Arthur fell into a bout of severe [[clinical depression|depression]].

Around the time of the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' storyline, Arthur was forced to return to action, compelled by his longtime partner Aqualad. Shortly into his new adventures, Aquaman lost his hand when the madman Charybdis stole his ability to communicate with sea life and stuck Arthur's hand in a pool of water teeming with [[piranhas]]. This caused him to become somewhat unhinged, and Aquaman soon began having prophetic dreams. Aquaman soon after fitted a [[harpoon]] for his missing hand, which led to an entirely new look, discarding his classic orange shirt for a silvery piece of armor that only covered the upper right half of his chest and part of his right arm, while growing long hair and a scraggly beard. At first, it was just a crude hook, but after the hook's destruction, Aquaman had it replaced with a cybernetic replacement from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. This new harpoon had a retractable reel that he could fully control.

====Recent stories====
[[Image:AquamanCVR15.jpg|thumb|right|The cover to ''Aquaman'' (volume 4) #15, which displays his current costume. Art by [[Alan Davis]].]]
Recently, Atlantis and its denizens were taken into the ancient past by a powerful [[sorceress]], who trapped Aquaman as a water-creature in a pool of water for the fifteen year period (dubbed "the Obsidian Age", as the storyline was also called) Atlantis spent in the past. Eventually, the Justice League freed Aquaman, and they returned Atlantis and its people to the present, though not before Aquaman was forced to sink ancient Atlantis. This caused displeasure among Atlantis' denizens, and they drove Aquaman out of Atlantis; Aquaman afterwards spent some time in Ireland, including meeting the [[Lady of the Lake]], who gives him a new prosthetic hand composed of magical water. From there he returned to his more classic look: orange shirt, clean shaven, and short hair.

Even more recently, Aquaman went to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] when the city suffered a massive [[earthquake]] that plunged half of it into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Aquaman soon discovered that the survivors of the catastrophe were able to breathe underwater, and started to help the survivors rebuild their submerged portion of the city (now called "Sub Diego"). During this time, Aquaman picked up a new sidekick named ''Lorena'', who makes herself into the new Aquagirl. There have been indications that Aquaman may reconcile with Mera.

===Crime Syndicate of America version===
In the alternate universe of ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' and its followups, the alternate Aquaman is called Barracuda. He was last seen attempting to lead the armies of Atlantis in an attack on the surface world.

==Supporting characters==
Aquaman's companions over the years have included:
* ''[[Mera]]'': Aquaman's ex-wife. Mera possessed the power to form structures made of hard water.
* ''[[Aqualad]]'': an outcast orphan from Atlantis whom Aquaman took in, and became for a time Aquaman's sidekick. Aqualad currently goes by the name ''Tempest''.
* ''Topo'': an [[octopus]] who was Aquaman's pet in various Silver Age stories.
* ''Vulko'': the chief scientific advisor of Atlantis.  Also spelled ''Vulco'' in his first appearance.
* ''Tula'': Also known as [[Aquagirl]] III; for a time, was Aqualad's girlfriend. Died in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.
* ''Lorena'': Also known as Aquagirl IV, Lorena was a regular human from San Diego who was changed into a water-breather in the disaster that befell the city.
* ''Koryak'': Aquaman's [[illegitimate]] son by Kako, an [[Inupiat]] woman. Koryak, who also possessed powers similar to Aquaman's, plotted with Vulko to take over Atlantis and was exiled, but was pardoned after the events of "The Obsidian Age" storyline.

==Aquaman villians==
Enemies of Aquaman include:

* ''[[Black Manta]]'': A would-be conqueror of Atlantis from the surface world; Black Manta is also noteworthy as the murderer of Aquaman's infant son.
* ''[[Ocean Master]]'': Another long-time foe of Aquaman. Ocean Master was revealed in the 1990s to be Aquaman's half-brother, as well as his real name being Orm.
* ''[[Charybdis (comics)|Charybdis]]'': A villain who was responsible for the loss of Aquaman's left hand.
* ''[[Shark (comics)|The Shark]]'': Originally one of [[Green Lantern]]'s enemies, Aquaman fought this mutated [[tiger shark]] on different occasions.
* ''[[Fisherman (comics)|The Fisherman]]'': A villain who uses [[fishing]] gimmicks to commit crimes.
* ''[[Awesome Threesome]]'': A trio of villains named Magneto, Torpedo Man, and Claw.
* ''[[Electric Man]]'': A villain who is immune to electric shocks.

==Adaptations in other media==
* Aquaman's first media appearance was as the star of his own cartoon series from 1967 until 1968; the series failed to find a large audience. The series featured Mera, Aqualad, a pet [[walrus]] named Tusky, and Aquaman and Aqualad's large [[sea horse]]s, Storm and Imp.

* Aquaman was also a major character in the long-running [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]'' (1972-1985). During the Super Friends tenure, he was often paired with [[Wonder Woman]], leading some fans to speculate on a possible romance between the Atlantean King and the Amazon Princess. 

[[Image:AquamanJL.jpg|Aquaman, as seen in the 2000s series ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]''.|thumb|150px]]
* Aquaman made an appearance in one episode of the 1990s cartoon ''[[Superman:_The_Animated_Series|Superman:The Animated Series]]''; he was voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]]. He was drawn in the "classic" Aquaman appearance as having an orange shirt, green gloves, green pants with green boots, a gold belt with gold "A" insignia belt buckle, short hair and a clean shaven face, but had a fairly intense personality. 

* Aquaman has guest starred in several episodes of the 2000s cartoons ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', where he is voiced by [[Scott Rummell]]. This version was based very closely on his hot headed anti-hero persona, especially with the "Viking" appearance and hook. Though a founding member of the Justice League in the comic books, he was left out of the main line up for the animated series in favor of the tomboyish Hawkgirl/Shayera Hol so that the team could have another female character opposite Wonder Woman. While the Justice League series remains popular, a number of fans were genuinely disappointed that Aquaman was not included as a regular character. 

* Aquaman also appeared in the ''[[Justice League Task Force]]'' [[Super Nintendo]] [[video game]].

[[Image:Aquaman_smallville.jpg|[[Alan Ritchson]] played Arthur Curry in the 2000s television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.|thumb|150px]]

* Arthur Curry made a guest appearance on an episode (entitled "Aqua") of the 2000s live-action series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', which aired on [[October 20]], [[2005]]. The episode features Arthur investigating the marine life-devastating effects of a project [[Lex Luthor]] has been developing for the [[United States]] military. In this series, Arthur is revealed to have the power to gather water-based energy balls and shoot them underwater, along with the ability to swim faster than [[Superman|Clark Kent]]. It is also revealed that Arthur wears his orange and green costume because he attends the [[University of Miami]]. Arthur is played by [[Alan Ritchson]].

* The WB television network has announced they have plans for an Aquaman spinoff series, but that it will not star [[Alan Ritchson]].

==Awards==
Aquaman was nominated for the [[Comics Buyers Guide]] Award for "Favorite Character" in 2001.

==Cultural references==
* In [[MTV]]'s [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[The State (TV series)|The State]]'', Aquaman is belittled by the other members of the [[Super Friends]] for his comparably uninteresting powers.  [[Superman]] assigns all of the other members difficult tasks, and then flippantly tells Aquaman to "go...talk to some fish."

* In [[HBO]]'s series ''[[Entourage (television series)|Entourage]]'', the main character Vince Chase is given an offer to do a [[superhero]] movie about Aquaman, directed by [[James Cameron]].

* [[Thomas Farr]] and [[Jeff Klein]] also made a fan film entitled "Aquaman - Cast Of The Angler" in 1984.  Running for 21 minutes, it was never released commercially.

* The song ''Arthur Curry'' by the band [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]] on their album ''less than art'' talks about the grimmer and grittier portrayal of Aquaman in the comics.

* In the 1990s [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "The Deal", George and Jerry debate Aquaman over lunch.  "What's the deal with Aquaman?" asks George.  "Can he only in survive in water, or what?"  Jerry replies, "No, I think I've seen him on land a couple times."

* In the animated series ''[[South Park]]'', the episode "[[Super Best Friends]]" includes a character named "Sea-Man" (pronounced "[[semen]]" by the other Super Best Friends), who is a spoof of Aquaman.

* In an episode of [[Dr. Katz%2C Professional Therapist]] called "Electric Bike" (summarized [http://www.ericdsnider.com/view.php?katzid=402 here]), [[Dave Chappelle]] discusses Aquaman with Dr. Katz, asking why anyone would want to be Aquaman. "What the hell would you want to say to a fish?"

* Aquaman has been referenced on two occasions in the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In one episode, when [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is drowning at the beach, he shouts out to his infant daughter, "[[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], help! Call Aquaman!" In a ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' [[Halloween]] special, the [[Comic Book Guy]] is shown reading an Aquaman comic.

* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "The Father, the Son and the Holy Fonz", the opening scene shows the Griffin family watching Aquaman (on TV) abusing his powers to communicate with the fish.

* In the animated series ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', [[Timmy Turner]] wishes for "the best friends ever," and receives spoofs of several superheroes, including an analog of Aquaman named "Wet Willy," who summons whales to crush things.
