==Powers and abilities==
Hermes possesses the typical powers of an Olympian; superhuman strength, durability, stamina, agility, and reflexes. He is immortal as well as resistant to all terrestrial diseases. Hermes can run and fly at speeds excelling those of any other Olympian god or goddess.

Hermes is an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, especially at wrestling. He is also an expert thief, skilled musician, and is adept at any pursuit requiring swiftness and dexterity.

Hermes is usually armed with a short sword, forged by [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]. His half-brother [[Apollo (Marvel Comics)|Apollo]] also created a caduceus for him, a magical device capable of controlling lesser beings, conducting ghosts, and turning objects into gold.

==Other versions==
In one alternate future, depicted in ''Hercules'' Vol. 2 #1-4, Hermes and the other Olympians leave Olympus in the 23rd century, leaving Hercules there to father a new race of gods.
