'''Callisto''' is an [[X-Men]] character. She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #169 and was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]]. Though she started out as a [[villain]] she has joined forces with the X-Men on several occasions and is currently an ally.  

When Callisto first appeared she was leader of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], a group of mutants who lived in the sewers (named after [[H.G. Wells]]'s characters in ''[[The Time Machine]]''), though she soon lost her role as leader to [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] in a duel. Callisto kidnapped [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] and stripped him of most of his clothing. She intended to marry him but he was knocked out at the time. More recently, she was transformed by the mutant [[Masque (comics)|Masque]], having her arms reformed into tentacles.  

Last seen, she was one of the main characters in the new volume of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], where she was helping [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] rebuild [[Genosha]].

Callisto also has a [[maternal]] relationship with [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], acting as a mother-figure towards the young mutant, though the two are not biologically related.

In the recent [[House of M]] aftermath Callisto is among the many to have lost her powers.

==Appearances in other media==

Callisto also appears in [[X-Men: Evolution]] animated series as [[Spyke]]'s love interest.
