==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=November 2013}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], she first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #169 ([[1983 in comics#May|May 1983]]).

==Fictional character biography==
Callisto's origins are unknown, although she claims that the scars she bears are proof of "how dumb a mistake" it was for her to try to live among normal humans; in one of her earlier appearances, her greatest psychological fear is the image of the beautiful woman that she once was.

===Morlocks===
Callisto takes up residence in an abandoned [[Cold War]]-era bomb shelter hidden within the sewers. Under untold circumstances, she meets [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a mutant whose power is to sense the presence of other mutants. She decides to make the bomb shelter a sanctuary for mutants like herself, using Caliban's power to track down such mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #170</ref> She calls this newly-formed society the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], after the group of futuristic subterraneans in "the Time Machine" by H.G. Wells.{{issue|date=November 2013}} Callisto kidnaps [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], intending to make him her mate. [[Kitty Pryde]] is struck with a deadly illness in an attempt to rescue him, and Callisto refuses to allow her companions to take her to the surface for medical treatment. To rescue Kitty, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] challenges and beats Callisto in a duel for the leadership of the Morlocks.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #169-170</ref> As the new leader of the Morlocks, Storm decrees that they would no longer kidnap and terrorize surface-dwellers, and in return they would have peace. The confrontation between Callisto and Storm leaves both parties consumed with hatred for each other.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #171</ref>

Callisto attempts to take revenge on Storm by manipulating Kitty Pryde into wedding Caliban, but is foiled when Caliban releases Kitty from their betrothal.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #179</ref> When the wizard [[Kulan Gath]] enslaves and [[wikt:ensorcell|ensorcell]]s the city of [[New York]] and transforms it into a [[Hyborian Age]] city, Callisto becomes his warrior servant.

Callisto helps defeat Kulan Gath, and as a result Callisto and her allies find themselves on a new timeline where Kulan Gath never transformed New York.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #190-191</ref>

Thereafter, Callisto becomes more of an ally to the X-Men. She rescues [[Professor X]] after he was nearly killed by an anti-mutant mob.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193</ref> She saves [[Power Pack]] from the Morlocks [[Annalee (comics)|Annalee]] and Masque.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #195</ref> Callisto is wounded during the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]' [[Mutant Massacre|massacre of the Morlocks]], and takes refuge with the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211</ref> She convinces Storm not to give up leadership of the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #212</ref>

After a while, Callisto moves to [[Muir Island]] to become the bodyguard for [[Moira MacTaggert]]. With Moira, she is transported to an alternate Earth where Britain is dominated by Nazis.<ref>''Excalibur'' #4</ref> Meanwhile, the Nazi counterparts of Callisto and Moira appear on the [[Earth-616|mainstream Earth]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #6</ref> These counterparts capture Brigadier [[Alistaire Stuart]] at the Tower of London,<ref>''Excalibur'' #9</ref> but fail in their attempt to escape the Tower of London.<ref>''Excalibur'' #10</ref> Both Callisto and Moira and their counterparts then return to their native Earths.<ref>''Excalibur'' #11</ref>

===Being beautiful===
Callisto later encounters an [[amnesia]]c [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who has assumed the identity of artist Peter Nicholas. Peter remembers nothing of his former life after his journey through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. The two become attracted to each other after [[Masque (comics)|Masque]], who had taken control of the Morlocks in Callisto's absence, restores Callisto's beauty to greater than it was, only to take it away later as a means of tormenting her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #259-260</ref> The process is repeated several times before Callisto and Colossus are rescued by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and [[Jean Grey]]. Callisto begins a career as a fashion model and moves above ground, embarking on a new life with Peter Nicholas as her lover. They are attacked by [[Genosha]]n magistrates but defeat them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #262-264</ref>

===Genoshan Excalibur===
She was one of the main characters in the 2004 ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' title, where she was helping [[Professor X]]avier and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] rebuild [[Genosha]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #12â€“13</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Callisto possesses enhanced senses of sight (including night vision), hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Her mutant power grants her tactical brilliance that allows her to see the best way to engage in any given conflict.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #38</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Callisto is neither a follower of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] nor an enemy of his regime. She's the leader of a band of [[pirate]]s that attack the few vessels that venture through the Infernal Gallop to [[Savage Land|Avalon]].<ref>''X-Calibre'' #2 (1995)</ref> She captures the submarine Excalibur and kills all of its passengers, except for [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and ends up being killed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref>''X-Calibre'' #2-3 (1995)</ref>

===Ultimate Callisto===
The Ultimate version of Callisto is introduced in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #82 as a member of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' # 82</ref> Her look has remained virtually unchanged, and she has the mutant ability to sprout a mass of tentacles from her eye which is covered by an eye-patch. It is also apparent that she has no control over herself when the tentacles come out, as Caliban had to knock her out to keep her from killing [[Jean Grey]] during a fight with the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' # 83</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Callisto appeared in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Susan Roman]]. She and the other Morlocks captured Cyclops and Jean Grey rather than Angel.
* Callisto also appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' voiced by [[Saffron Henderson]]. She is depicted as a less-violent, more even-tempered leader of the Morlocks. She first appeared to sabotage a beverage company when its beverage Pow-R-8 (Power Eight) leaks into the sewers and is revealed to be poisonous to the mutants. She later returned when anti-mutant thugs were using laser technology to attack the X-Men, [[Spyke]], and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]].

===Film===

She was the leader of The Omegas and then joins forces with Magneto's [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In place of an [[eyepatch]] and scars, this version of Callisto is heavily tattooed and has many piercings, and she seems to harbor a dislike towards Storm. She was electrocuted by Storm after their climactic battle on [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]].

===Novelization===
* According to the book adaptation of ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', she was the leader of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], an all-mutant gang before joining Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants.
