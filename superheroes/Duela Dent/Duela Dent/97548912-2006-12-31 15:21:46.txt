'''Duela Dent''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]]. She is a former member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and current member of [[Titans East]].  She has used the aliases Joker's Daughter, Catgirl, Scarecrone, Riddler's Daughter, Penguin's Daughter, [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]] and Card Queen.

==Character History==
===Pre-Crisis===
In Pre-Crisis history, '''Duela Dent''' first appeared as '''Joker's Daughter''' in the ''Batman Family'' series of comic books. She then gained the attention of [[Dick_Grayson|Robin]] as she later claimed to be the daughter of [[Catwoman]], [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Riddler]], and [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]. She found out Robin's identity and he revealed her identity as that of Duela Dent, [[Two-Face]]'s daughter.

Duela claimed she wanted to join the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] to make up for her father's crimes. Not everyone was for this idea. In ''Teen Titans #48'' she changed her identity to '''[[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]]'''.  As Harlequin, Duela utilized gimmicks such as smoke-cloud inducing powder puffs and bullet-firing lipstick.

After the Teen Titans comic books were canceled, she popped up in the Batman comic books. During two issues, she called herself '''Card Queen''' while infiltrating a criminal organization called MAZE. 

Her last Pre-Crisis appearance was in ''Tales Of The Teen Titans #50'', as a guest at [[Donna Troy]]'s wedding. It is retconned that she is too old to ever have been the daughter of Two-Face here. Before the identity of her actual father can be found out, she disappears.

===Post-Crisis===
[[Delusional]] and [[schizophrenic]], the mysterious Harlequin has been in and out mental institutions for several years. An acrobat who possesses numerous "clown-motif" gadgets, she has been called Duela Dent, but her true identity remains unknown.

Her first significant Post-Crisis appearance was in the ''[[Titans (comics)|Team Titans]]'' comic book, as a patient in a mental hospital. The writers of the title originally planned to reveal that Harlequin was a time traveling member of the Team Titans who had gone insane from the shock of time travel and her separation from her fellow Team Titan cell members. 

Due to the cancellation of the series, plans for her to return to the team in a storyline where she steals a reality-altering device and warp New York City back to a replica of the late 1970s version of itself were aborted. However, the final issue of Team Titans jokingly solicited the story as occurring in Team Titans #25, as a final joke towards its cancellation. 

Harlequin next aided the Titans during the Technis Imperative, when [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s automated system sought out all Titans allies, past and present. Although she was still in a mental institution at the time, Duela was rescued by Cyborg and helped battle the [[Justice League]] for Cyborg's soul. Following this she made a brief appearance in a bar in ''Titans Secret Files'' #1, insisting to anyone who would listen that the Titans would soon be contacting her about membership. She also claimed she was the daughter of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].

Duela's next appearance would be in the ''Titans Secret Files #2'', in a backup story in which [[Beast Boy|Gar]]'s obnoxious cousin Matt decided to hold a membership drive for the new version of [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans West]], "Titans L.A." Harlequin crashed the official meeting-turned-party with a small group of villains, including Beast Boy's enemies Fear and Loathing, simply because she hadn't been invited. [[Bette Kane|Flamebird]] and [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] defeated her and returned her to The Helping House Mental Institution in Industry, California. No explanation was given as to where she found the dangerous villains that aided her party-crashing.

In the same comic, a feature on former Titans stated that all her claims as to who her father was had been disproved, except one. No further information was given.

In a short story contained in the ''Teen Titans/Outsiders Secret Files #2'', Duela is inexplicably socializing with several villains on their secret satellite headquarters. In this short back-up tale, Duela makes a handful of wild claims as to her parentage, all of which are dismissed by the non-plussed villains. The only new wrinkle added to her tale in this story was a claim that she had been resucitated by the [[Lazarus Pit]] and, most interestingly, that her mother may actually be the villainous parent she has always claimed.

Duela returned to action alongside almost every former Titans member against [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] in Teen Titans (vol. 3) and again in ''Infinite Crisis'' #4 and ''Teen Titans'' #32 against [[Superboy-Prime]].

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later]], it was mentioned that both the Joker's Daughter and the [[Riddler's Daughter]] were members during the lost year gap. Currently, she is a member of the splinter group [[Titans East]], with writer [[Geoff Johns]] stating "Yeah. We're going to really get into her. Tony [Daniel] did an amazing redesign on the Joker's daughter for Titans East." [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=79802]

===Titans Tomorrow===
[[Image:TitansTomorrowDuela.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Duela appears in the alternate future storyline "[[Titans Tomorrow]]".]]
In the "[[Titans Tomorrow]]" storyline (which took place in a possible future), Duela destroyed [[Arkham Asylum]] and tried to reconcile with her father, who ignored her. In a fit of rage she killed [[Batgirl]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]], and [[Bette Kane]]. She was also responsible for doing something to members of the GCPD, specifically [[Crispus Allen]]. She again called herself Joker's Daughter, and traded chattering teeth and riddles for more deadly accesories. She was shot to death by [[Batman]] II, [[Tim Drake]] of the future. Before she was killed she hinted that she knew more about him when he was younger.

==Villainous genes==
Over the years, Duela has claimed, whether seriously or in jest, to be the offspring of the following DC Universe villains:

*[[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]
*[[Two-Face]]
*[[Catwoman]]
*[[Riddler]]
*[[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]]
*[[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest]]
*[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]
*[[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]]
*[[Punch and Jewelee]]

In ''Titans Secret Files'' #2, it is stated that her father has been identified, however nothing was ever revealed. However, she has recently hinted that her villainous parent is actually her mother, and not her father. The mystery of Duela Dent's true identity continues today.

When creator Bob Rozakis was asked "What do you think of the current insane version of Duela Dent, who claims to be the daughter of multiple supervillains?", he replied "I got a laugh out of it when I first saw it, but I thought they wasted the character. I realize that Marv and company didn't want her around any more and felt they had to explain her away because of continuity, but they could have just as easily ignored her. Actually, I consider [[Harley Quinn]] to be a reincarnation of Duela." [http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/duela.html]

==Other Versions==
[[Harlequin_%28comics%29#Kingdom_Come_-_Joker.27s_Daughter_II|A new Joker's Daughter]] appeared in the ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' mini-series and ''The Kingdom: [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]]'' # 1.  She is described as a riot girl, who is "one of many to follow the Joker's chaotic style."  She is not related to either Duela Dent or the Joker.

[[Joker_%28comics%29#Tangent_Comics|A female version of the Joker]] appeared as part of DC's [[Tangent Comics]] line in her own one-shot (''Tangent Comics: The Joker'') in [[1997]]. This Joker bore little resemblance to the traditional interpretation of the character, and instead was modeled on Duela Dent.
