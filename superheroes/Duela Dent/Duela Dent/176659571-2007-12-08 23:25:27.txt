'''Duela Dent''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]]. She is a former member of both the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and [[Titans East]]. Introduced under the alias of '''Joker's Daughter''', she has also used the aliases "Catgirl", "Scarecrone",  "[[Enigma (comics)|Riddler's Daughter]]", "Penguin's Daughter", "Card Queen", and "[[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]]".

==Fictional character history==
===Pre-''Crisis''===
'''Duela Dent''' first appeared as '''Joker's Daughter''' in the ''Batman Family'' series of comic books. She gained the attention of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], as she later claimed to be the daughter of [[Catwoman]], [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Riddler]], and [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]. She deduced Robin's identity and he revealed that she was Duela Dent, [[Two-Face]]'s daughter.

[[Image:TitansDuela.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Duela joins the Teen Titans.]]
Duela claimed she wanted to join the [[Teen Titans (comics)#1970s revival|Teen Titans]] to atone for her father's crimes. Not everyone was in favor of this idea. In ''Teen Titans'' #48 she changed her identity to '''[[Harlequin (comics)#Duela Dent|Harlequin]]'''.  As Harlequin, Duela utilized gimmicks such as smoke-inducing powder puffs and bullet-firing lipstick.

After the ''Teen Titans'' comic books were canceled, she popped up in the Batman titles, calling herself '''Card Queen''' while infiltrating a criminal organization called MAZE. 

Duela's last pre-''Crisis'' appearance is in ''Tales Of The Teen Titans'' #50, as a guest at [[Donna Troy]]'s wedding. She is described as being too old to be Two-Face's daughter, and disappears before her true identity can be revealed.

===Post-''Crisis''===
[[Delusion]]al and [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]], the mysterious Harlequin has been in and out mental institutions for several years. An acrobat who possesses numerous "clown-motif" gadgets, she calls herself Duela Dent (while her true identity remains unknown).

[[Image:HarlequinDuela.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Duela in her Harlequin persona]]
Her first significant Post-''Crisis'' appearance was in the ''[[Teen Titans (comics)#Team Titans|Team Titans]]'' comic book, as a patient in a mental hospital. The writers of the title originally planned to reveal that Harlequin was a time-traveling member of the Teen Titans driven insane by her time-warping experience. [http://www.titanstower.com/source/libindex/teamerindex.html]

However, due to the cancellation of the series, plans for her to return were aborted.  The final issue of ''Team Titans'' solicited a non-existent story for ''Team Titans'' #25, and provided a commentary on the title's cancellation.  In the solicitation, Duela steals a reality-altering device and shifts New York City into the late 1970s.[http://members.aol.com/Drumore/Articles/Phil.html] [http://www.titanstower.com/source/libhunt/teamerphil.html]

Harlequin aided the Titans during the "Technis Imperative," in which [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s automated system seeks out all Titans allies, past and present. Although she is in a mental institution, Duela is rescued by Cyborg and helps battle the [[Justice League]] for Cyborg's soul. 

Duela makes a brief appearance in ''Titans Secret Files'' #1, insisting to anyone who would listen that the Titans would soon contact her about membership. She also claims that she is the daughter of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DuelaTitansLA.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Duela in ''Titans Secret Files'' #2]] -->
Duela's next appearance is in ''Titans Secret Files'' #2, in a backup story in which [[Beast Boy|Gar]]'s obnoxious cousin Matt holds a membership drive for the [[Teen Titans (comics)#The Titans (1999â€“2002)|Teen Titans West]], "Titans L.A." Harlequin crashes the meeting-turned-party with a small group of villains, including Beast Boy's enemies Fear and Loathing, simply because she hasn't been invited. [[Bette Kane|Flamebird]] and [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] defeat her and return her to The Helping House Mental Institution in Industry, California.  How she met up with the dangerous villains with whom she crashed the party is unexplained.

In the same comic, a feature states that her claims regarding her paternity have been disproved, save one; no further information is provided.

In a short story contained in the ''Teen Titans/Outsiders Secret Files'' #2, Duela socializes with several villains at their secret satellite headquarters and makes a series of wild claims regarding her parentage, all of which are dismissed by the nonplussed villains (she claims that she has been resuscitated by a [[Lazarus Pit]] and that her mother may actually be the villainous parent).

Duela returned to action alongside the assembled Titans who faced [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3), and [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]] in ''Infinite Crisis'' #4 and ''Teen Titans'' #32.

===One Year Later===
The Joker's Daughter and [[Enigma (comics)|Enigma]] both served on the Teen Titans during the lost year.  Duela is a member of the splinter group [[Titans East]], with writer [[Geoff Johns]] stating: "Yeah. We're going to really get into her. [[Tony Daniel]] did an amazing redesign on the Joker's daughter for Titans East." <ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=79802 CATCHING UP WITH GEOFF JOHNS - Newsarama]</ref>

In ''Teen Titans'' #43, [[Miss Martian]] and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] arrive at [[Belle Reve]] prison to question their former team mate [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]], who has betrayed the team. [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] and [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]] arrive, and Batgirl murders Bombshell by slitting her throat with a razor sharp [[batarang]].  Duela and [[Enigma (comics)|Enigma]] cut the prison's power supply, allowing the inmates to escape and attack Miss Martian and Cyborg.

During the attack, Enigma comments to Duela: "Wait'll dear old daddy gets a load of us!"

The two are the captors and tormentors of [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], whom they torture psychologically. Duela reveals that she joined Titans East simply because they asked.  Raven points out that Duela has always been an ally of the Titans, and offers her membership on the team. Duela accepts the invitation by punching Enigma, and fights alongside the Titans against Titans East. When the battle ends, Duela and Batgirl disappear.

===''Countdown''===
Duela appears in the first issue of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]''. She abducts a teen celebrity from a nightclub, only to be stopped by [[Jason Todd]]. She claims that she comes from an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|alternate Earth]]. After escaping, Duela is killed by a [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]], who states, "This world is not yours. Your presence in it is not tolerated. The penalty is death."<ref>''Countdown'' #51 (2007)</ref> When informed of Duela's death, the Joker says he never had a daughter.<ref>''Countdown'' #50</ref> The Monitor of New Earth suggests that Duela's father is actually an alternate version of the Joker, indicating "She didn't belong [...] making others think she was the Joker's daughter. Which on that world, she most certainly was ''not''."<ref>''Countdown'' #40</ref> Dan DiDio, editor-in-chief of DC, has stated that Duela's murder will have a ripple effect throughout the series.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=112180/ "Dishing with Dan: Countdown #51"]</ref>  Nightwing, Robin, Donna Troy, Wonder Girl, and Ravager set out to investigate Duela's death, but their inquiries are cut short by one of the Monitors, who diverts their attention elsewhere.<ref>Teen Titans (Vol. 3) #47</ref>

In ''Countdown Presents The Search for Ray Palmer: Crime Society'' it is revealed that [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]]'s heroic version of the Joker, the Jokester, is the father of Duela Dent, and that her mother was Evelyn Dent, Three-Face (the Earth-3 version of Two-Face).  She was raised by Three-Face and her stepfather, the Earth-3 Riddler, and together the three formed the Riddler Family. When she was finally introduced to her birth father, she dropped cryptic hints implying that she or her consciousness shifts unknowingly from Earth to Earth - the source of her parental confusion.  When the Jokester joined the Riddler Family, Duela revealed that she had been in a relationship with [[Talon (DC Comics)|Talon]], [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman's]] teenaged sidekick. The Jokester renounced her as his daughter and Duela left with Talon moments before the Crime Society stormed their apartment. The Riddler was killed by [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] and Three-Face's arm was torn off by [[Superwoman]]; the Jokester managed to flee until he is later tracked down and killed by Solomon, the Monitor who killed Duela.

==Villainous parentage==

Duela has claimed to be the offspring of the following villains:
*[[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]<ref>''Batman Family'' #6 (1977)</ref>
*[[Catwoman]]<ref>''Batman Family'' #8</ref>
*[[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]]<ref>''Batman Family #9</ref>
*[[Riddler]]<ref>''Batman Family #9</ref>
*[[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]]<ref>''Batman Family #9</ref>
*[[Two-Face]]<ref>''Batman Family #9</ref>
*[[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest]]
*[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]
*[[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]]
*[[Punch and Jewelee]]

Duela Dent is originally depicted as the daughter of Two-Face.  Creator Bob Rozakis stated, "It didn't take too long to decide whose daughter she would turn out to be.  After all, the only married villain was Two-Face.  I convinced Julie (and associate editor E. Nelson Bridwell, the acknowledged keeper of DC's historical consistency) that Harvey and Gilda Dent had a daughter, that Harvey had been disappointed because she wasn't a twin, and that they'd named her Duela." <ref>http://titanstower.com/source/whoswho/duela.html</ref>

Rozakis, upon being asked: "What do you think of the current insane version of Duela Dent, who claims to be the daughter of multiple supervillains?" replied: "I got a laugh out of it when I first saw it, but I thought they wasted the character. I realize that Marv and company didn't want her around anymore and felt they had to explain her away because of continuity, but they could have just as easily ignored her. Actually, I consider [[Harley Quinn]] to be a reincarnation of Duela."<ref>[http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/duela.html Titans Tower: Duela Dent]</ref>

==Other versions==
===Infinite Crisis===
In ''Infinite Crisis'' #6, Alexander Luthor creates multiple Earths.  On Earth-154, Superman and Batman, along with their sons Superman Jr. and Batman Jr. (the [[Super-Sons]]), round up two young, female versions of the Joker and Riddler, along with the daughter of Lex Luthor.

===Kingdom Come===
[[Image:KCJD.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Joker's Daughter II in Kingdom Come.]]
In ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', there is [[Harlequin (comics)#Kingdom Come|a new Joker's Daughter]], identified as both '''Joker's Daughter II''' and '''Harlequin IV''' in annotations for the series and according to [[Alex Ross]].

The ''Kingdom Come Revelations'' supplement<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/kc1.html Kingdom Come #1 Annotations]</ref> adds the following:

''"Along with Batman's apparent influence on others to follow his style, so has the Joker inspired a few to take after his chaotic clown style. The original Joker's Daughter (who actually turned out to be Two-Face's Daughter) was a former member of the Teen Titans and has no direct relation to this new "riot girl" version, nor is there a true familial relation to the Joker."''

Joker's Daughter II is modeled on [[Jill Thompson]], a writer/artist; Thompson is Chicago-based, as is Alex Ross. Austin Loomis adds that Thompson has occasionally drawn herself into stories that she was illustrating for Vertigo.

It is noted throughout this series Joker's Daughter II is always quite dour and serious, quite the change from her namesake, and another example of the generational-clash theme of Kingdom Come.

Following the death of Von Bach, Ex1Machina points out that Joker's Daughter II has undergone a drastic makeup change, with a tear tattooed beneath her eye.

She is one of the few characters to survive the final battle in #4.  She later reappeared in ''The Kingdom: [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]]'' # 1.

===Tangent Comics===
[[Joker (comics)#DC Universe|A female version of the Joker]] appeared as part of DC's [[Tangent Comics]] line in her own one-shot (''Tangent Comics: The Joker'') in [[1997]]. This Joker bore little resemblance to the traditional interpretation of the character, and instead was modeled on Duela Dent.

===Teen Titans Go!===
In ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', the comic book based on the animated series, [[Kitten (Teen Titans)|Kitten]], the daughter of [[Killer Moth]], took revenge against him for not taking her on vacation in issue #41. She committed crimes disguised as '''Mad Maud''', the daughter of [[Mad Mod]]; '''Joystick''', the daughter of [[Control Freak (villain)|Control Freak]]; '''Marionette''', the daughter of the [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Puppet King|Puppet King]]; '''Pink X''' the daughter of [[Red X]]; '''[[Gemini (DC Comics)|Gemini]]''', the daughter of [[Madame Rouge]]; '''Mademoiselle Mallah''', the daughter of [[Monsieur Mallah]]; '''[[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]]''', the daughter of [[Deathstroke|Slade]]; and '''Daughter Blood''', the daughter of [[Brother Blood]]. Robin, exasperated after trying to figure out the connection between the criminals, mutters that it's probably just Joker's Daughter playing a prank.

''Teen Titans Go!'' writer [[J. Torres]] confirmed that this character's motives were inspired by Duela Dent. Torres said, "Yeah, I like Duela Dent. Did you see the short story I did starring her in ''Teen Titans/Outsiders Secret Files 2005''? After I did that, I came up with an idea for a story where a mystery girl runs around Jump City claiming to be the daughter of different Titans' villains."

===Titans Tomorrow===
[[Image:TitansTomorrowDuela.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Duela appears in the alternate future storyline "[[Titans Tomorrow]]".]]
In the "[[Titans Tomorrow]]" storyline (which took place in a possible future), Duela destroyed [[Arkham Asylum]] and tried to reconcile with her father, who ignored her. In a fit of rage she killed [[Batgirl]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]], and [[Bette Kane]]. She was also responsible for doing something to members of the GCPD, specifically [[Crispus Allen]]. She again called herself Joker's Daughter, and traded chattering teeth and riddles for more deadly accessories. She was shot to death by [[Batman]] IV, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] of the future. Before she was killed, she hinted that she knew more about him when he was younger.
