'''Hindsight''' (Carlton Lafroyge) is a [[Marvel Comics]] character appearing in the [[New Warriors]] series. Soon after Robbie Baldwin (the superhero [[Speedball (comics)|Speedball]]) moved into his building,Lafroyge discovered Baldwin's secret identity (New Warriors Annual 3) and blackmailed him by threatening to reveal his secret identity (issue 35). Baldwin refused. Soon, the New Warriors were captured by a street gang called [[The Poison Memories]], who had earlier kidnapped various team members' relatives. Lafroyge, calling himself Hindsight Lad and dressing in pajamas and a bicycle helmet, called on [[Night Thrasher]] to help free them. Through this, he weaseled his way onto the team as a non-official member (issue 38).

Soon, Night Thrasher recognized his use to the team, and offered him full membership (issue 51). He changed costumes to a red/yellow suit and dropped the 'Lad' part of his name (issue 60). Through him, another person gained membership, [[Timeslip]]. He remained with the team until sometime after issue 75.

Hindsight possesses no special abilities, though [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] (Mickey Musashi) offered to share her costume with him after her previous partner died. This was never explored.

Hindsight was supposed to appear in [[Jay Faerber]]'s New Warriors Vol. 2 as the newest [[Box]], a member of Canadian team [[Alpha Flight]]. This was unexplored, as the series was cancelled before this story could be developed.
