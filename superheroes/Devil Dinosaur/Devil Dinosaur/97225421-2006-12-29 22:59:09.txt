[[Devil Dinosaur]] is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who resembles a [[tyrannosaurus rex]]. He first appeared in ''Devil Dinosaur'' #1 ([[1978#April|April 1978]]). Devil Dinosaur is from Dinosaur World, a planet where [[dinosaurs]] still exist and human life is primitive.

==Fictional Character Biography==

Devil Dinosaur was nearly burned to death by a tribe of [[Killer-Folk]], hostile beings native to his planet, but was rescued by [[Moon Boy]], a young member of a rival tribe, the [[Small-Folk]]. Exposure to the fire activated a mutation in the dinosaur which gave him powers greater than others of his species and turned his skin from olive green to flame red. Devil Dinosaur is fiercely loyal to his constant companion Moon Boy and seems more intelligent than the average dinosaur (as they are portrayed in the comic). In the first issue of ''Devil Dinosaur'', creater [[Jack Kirby]] in the "Dinosaur Dispatches" letters column (see image) states that the original intent was for Moon Boy and Devil to be an early [[human]] and dinosaur from Earth's past. Kirby writes: "After all, just where the Dinosaur met his end, and when Man first stood reasonably erect, is still shrouded in mystery." Later, it was [[retconned]] that the characters were a humanoid and a dinosaur-like creature from an alternate universe ("Earth-7841" in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Multiverse]]).
