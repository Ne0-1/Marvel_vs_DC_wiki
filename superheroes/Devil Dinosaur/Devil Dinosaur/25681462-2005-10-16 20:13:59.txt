The series lasted nine issues in total and was created during [[Jack Kirby]]'s third time at Marvel. The first time he was at Marvel was in the 1940's when he worked for [[Timely Comics]] which would one day become Marvel. The second one was during the late early [[1960's]] until the early [[1970's]]. The third time was from [[1976]] until the early [[1980's]].

[[Devil Dinosaur]] was an alien being that resembled a [[tyrannosaurus rex]] He was from Dinosaur World, an extra-dimensional world where dinosaurs didn't become extinct and human life was slowly evolving. He was nearly burned to death by the Killer-Folk, hostile humanoids on his native planet. Devil Dinosaur was rescued by an ape like human called [[Moonboy]] who became his companion. The fire activated a mutation in the [[dinosaur]] in that gave him powers greater than others of his species and turned his skin from olive green to flame red. Devil Dinosaur was fiercely loyal to Moonboy and seemed more intelligent than the average [[dinosaur]] (as they were portrayed in the comic). Devil Dinosaur also appeared in a publication of the Marvel [[Godzilla Comics|Godzilla series]].

The series was written with the hopes of it being picked up as an [[animated]] series.

After Devil Dinosaur ceased publication the two main characters  appeared in the [[1987]] [[Fallen Angels]] mini-series.

Another known fact is that Devil Dinosaur and Moonboy encountered [[Ghost Rider]], became mesmerized by the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], freed by [[Spider-Man]], and relocated to the [[Savage Land]].

In 2005 Marvel announced the October publication of four "Marvel Monsters" one-shot comic books; Devil Dinosaur was included in the group. The issue is drawn and co-written by Eric Powell, who writes and illustrates [[The Goon]] for [[Dark Horse Comics]].
