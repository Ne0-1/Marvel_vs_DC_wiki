'''Trance''' ('''Hope Abbott''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Hope attends the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] and retained her powers post-[[House of M]].

==Fictional character biography==
Hope was raised in [[Bloomfield Hills]], [[Michigan]]. When Hope's powers manifested, it appeared as if a ghost had come out of her body, giving her father a [[heart attack]]. She was then sent to the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] by her parents believing that she would be "cured."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=774&disp=table Comic Book Resources Wolverine: Killing Made Simple Preview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

While at the Institute, Hope was put in the [[Paragons (comics)|Paragons Squad]] under the watch of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Hope then took on the codename Trance. When it was outted that Wolfsbane and a student ([[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]) had been in a relationship, Wolfsbane decided to leave. [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] then took over as the squad's advisor.

When the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] transpired, she was one of only 27 students to keep her powers. Greatly weakened by the losses, [[Emma Frost]] placed all of the remaining students into an all-out brawl to determine who would become the team of [[New X-Men|X-Men]] in-training.  Hope did not make the team yet, like all of the other students who retained their powers, still resides as the Institute.  

In response to M-Day, the government began gathering all information they had on the remaining mutants. Additionally, the [[Sentinel (comics)#Sentinel Squad O*N*E|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]], a team of human-piloted Sentinels, was sent to "watch over" the X-Men and the handful of [[refugee]]s symbolically known as [[X-Men: The 198|The 198]].  According to said files, Hope was willing to work with other mutants in training sessions but had not yet received any [[combat]] experience.

===Quest for Magik===
Trance is among the students who were captured by [[Belasco]] and transported to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. As per [[X-23]]'s request, Trance uses her astral projection to warn the students who weren't captured of Belasco's return. Thanks to Trance, the students were successfully saved and brought back by the X-Men.

===Messiah Complex===
Trance was present at the Institute when [[Predator X]] attacked the school. Trance barely got out of the way in time. Unfortunately the school was shut down and all the students were sent home.

===Killing Made Simple===
Blindfold had a vision and informed the X-Men that Trance was going to be in trouble. While having dinner with her family, Trance's home was attacked by [[Orphan-Maker]] on [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]]'s orders, but Trance wasn't his target, her parents were. Luckily [[Wolverine]] had been sent by the X-Men to watch over her. Springing to action, Wolverine tries to fight off Orphan Maker but is overpowered. With a change of plans, Trance and Wolverine are kidnapped. Trance is later seen tied to a chair with Wolverine chained to the ground. Trance, believing that Wolverine will save them, refuses to use her powers. After realizing that Wolverine cannot help her, she astral projects outside her body and begins blasting Nanny and Orphan Maker. Nanny and Orphan Maker eventually eject in an escape pod, leaving the ship to crash. Using her energy blasts, Trance disables the self-destruct timer. The ship crashes in a lake, but Trance and Wolverine are safe.

===Manifest Destiny===
Trance is briefly seen in X-Men: Manifest Destiny #2, having relocated to San Francisco along with all the other X-Men.

==Powers and abilities==
Hope has an [[astral projection]] power, the scope of which has not yet been <!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Tranceastral.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hope in her astral form, art by [[Mark Brooks]]]] -->fully displayed. Her [[code name]] suggests that she goes into some kind of [[altered state of consciousness]] or somehow otherwise nullifies her body in order to release her astral self. Her astral form is capable of flight and can pass through magic barriers. This observation was further affirmed when she asked Emma Frost if she could leave her body outside the danger room during an exercise. It is unusual in that whilst most fiction depicts astral projection as harmless, Hope's power somehow causes energy damage, though the extent is not known.

==Trivia==
* Hope's interests include old [[film|films]] and classic music, and it appears she is rather culturally sophisticated. Her classmates voted her 'best-dressed' in the yearbook.
