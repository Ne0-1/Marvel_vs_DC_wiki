Looker is a female [[superhero]] in the [[DC Universe]] of [[comics]].  The character's first appearance was in ''Batman & the Outsiders #25''.


==History==
Emily Briggs was a mousy librarian who lived a quiet life with her husband in [[Gotham City]]. That all changed when she was kidnapped by people from the underground civilization known as Abyssia.

[[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]] set out to rescue Emily. After a battle with the people of Abyssia, Emily's heritage was revealed to her and as [[Halley's Comet]] passed by the Earth, Emily underwent a metahuman transformation.

After leaving Abyssia to it's people, Emily returned with the Outsiders and an astonished husband. She soon took on the name 'Lia' as well as a more confident, yet self-centered, personality.

Emily's first outing as Looker occurred after the Outsiders had been captured by the Masters of Disaster. After defeating the Masters of Disaster,she freed the Outsiders and was welcomed into their ranks.

Some time later, Looker received a call for help from Abyssia. Traveling to the underground city, Looker discovered that Abyssia had been taken over. Lia invoked a challenged the despot and, in the course of the battle, she was stripped of her beauty and much of her power. Shortly afterwards, Geo-Force disbanded the Outsiders and Lia returned to her previous life in Gotham City.

When [[Geo-Force]]'s homeland was over-run with [[vampires]], Emily's powers returned and Looker was back in action alongside the Outsiders for a night.  During battle with the vampires, Looker became a victim of their leader, Roderick. Having become a vampire, Looker's existing powers were joined by some new abilities.  Once the vampires were defeated, the Outsiders were 'un-officially' disbanded, working nearly solely out of Markovia, Geo-Force's homeland which he now reigned over.  Served with divorce papers and now living under the vampiric curse, Lia has apparently broken all ties with her past life.

Lia Briggs was last seen as one of the hosts of a television program similar to "The View."  The other hosts included [[Vicki Vale]] and [[Tawny Young]]. This was revealed in an issue of ''[[Wonder Woman]]''.

==Powers & Abilities==
Telepathy, Telekinesis, Psychometry, Enhanced Metabolism, Superhuman Strength, Enhanced Healing. Due to her vampiric nature, Looker can turn into vapor, but only at night.  She also has the vampiric ability to mentally command vermin such as bugs. Due to possessing psychic powers, Looker does not share the vampire weakness to sunlight.

==Comparisons==
Except for the black and pink [[Arlecchino|Harlequin-type]] outfit she wore, many readers felt Looker was too similiar to the [[Marvel Comics]] character, [[Jean Grey]].  Both women had telepathy and telekinesis as their powers (though Looker would mesmerize people more often than Jean would).  Both were tall and had red hair.  Both worked as models.  Both had brooding husbands.  Both gained their powers/power enhancements through an external cosmic source. 

*''Quite a few readers felt cheated upon discovering Looker's status as a vampire and felt this was the downfall for a potentially interesting character.''
