==Fictional character biography==
Part of the [[thuggee]] cult, Ravan tries to stop the coming of Kali and thereby the [[Kali Yuga]], the Age of Chaos. By killing, he delays the coming of Kali another thousand years.

Ravan joins the Suicide Squad, so he can continue these efforts while actually being sponsored by the American Government.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #18</ref> He proceeds to develop a strange bond with Bronze Tiger, whom he swears to kill for his earlier defeats, but the two also form an effective team. During the [[Janus Directive]], when Waller must make it seem she is being controlled by Kobra she sends the squad after the [[Force of July]]. Ravan kills [[Mayflower (comics)|Mayflower]], a respected superhero.

Ravan becomes instrumental to Amanda Waller's plan to finish of the LOA, a drug-dealing organization. The villain's plan to expose the Squad succeeds. It is revealed that a Mr. Kale, who was seemingly the new boss, was just a front for Amanda Waller, who had never left power. who expose that the Suicide Squad is still being run by Amanda Waller (the general public had been led to believe a Mr. Kale had taken over, but he was only an actor, used as a front so that Waller could still run the Squad).<ref name="Suicide Squad vol. 1 #37-39">''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #37-39</ref>

With the Suicide Squad on the verge of disbanding by her superiors, Amanda Waller gathers Ravan, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Deadshot]] in an assassination mission of the LOA, a group that is planning to create a zombie army. The deal for the villains is simple: The three will help Waller in killing the LOA, and afterward they are set free.<ref name="Suicide Squad vol. 1 #37-39"/>

The mission succeeds, and Amanda Waller goes to jail on charges of murder, while Ravan leaves for London, where he sets up a '[[cyberchurch]]' as a front for his assassination organization. A year later, Batman kidnaps Ravan from this 'church' (blowing it up in the process) for the new Suicide Squad run again by Amanda Waller.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #41-43</ref>

With this Squad Ravan goes to Israel in order to capture Kobra. But Kobra, had already been captured by the Israeli government's superteam the [[Hayoth]]. Ravan easily manipulates one of their agents, and thereby giving him access to their highly advanced [[Artificial Intelligence|A.I.]] computer [[Dybbuk (comics)|Dybbuk]]. While Kobra's plans are being thwarted by the rest of the Suicide Squad, Ravan faces Kobra in combat, but Kobra has the upper hand and is close to killing Ravan.

At the last moment, [[Atom (comics)#Adam Cray|the third Atom]] appears on the scenes, striking down Kobra. Ravan's last wish is for either him or the Atom to kill Kobra, but Atom denies him that final wish, and as Ravan himself says, he dies unfulfilled. Ravan dies in ''Suicide Squad'' #47.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #45-47</ref> According to ''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 2) #11 however, Ravan is  incapacitated, rather than deceased, as is shown on a computer screen being viewed by the second Rustam.

During the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Ravan's corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #67 (January 2010)</ref> Ravan is apparently destroyed by the [[Manhunters|Manhunter]]'s self-destruct mechanism to unleashing an explosion of [[Green Lantern]] energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #18 (February 2010)</ref>
