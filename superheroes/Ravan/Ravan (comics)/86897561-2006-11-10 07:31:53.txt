'''Ravan''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[villain]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' (vol. 1) #1 (1987), as a member of the villainous mercenary team [[Jihad (comics)|Jihad]]. In an encounter with the [[Bronze Tiger]] his back was broken <ref>''[[Suicide Squad]]'' (vol. 1) #1</ref>. He re-appears alongside the Jihad in ''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #17, and is recruited for the Suicide Squad in his   second encounter with the Bronze Tiger <ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #18</ref>.

Part of the [[thuggee]] cult, Ravan tries to stop the coming of Kali and thereby the Kali-Yuga, the Age of Chaos. By killing, he delays the coming of Kali another thousand years. It is through this practice that he both prevents and worships [[Kali]]. In this, his primary enemy is the villain [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] who wishes to bring forth that same Age <ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #1, 33</ref>.

Ravan joins the Suicide Squad, so he can continue these efforts while actually being sponsored by the American Government <ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #18</ref>. He proceeds to develop a strange bond with Bronze Tiger, whom he swears to kill for his earlier defeats, but the two also form an effective team. He becomes instrumental to Amanda Waller's plan to finish of the LOA, a drugdealing organisation, who expose that the Suicide Squad is still being run by Amanda Waller (the general public had been led to believe a Mr. Kale had taken over, but he was only an actor, used as a front so that Waller could still run the Squad) <ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #37-39</ref>.

With the Suicide Squad on the verge of disbanding by her superiors, Amanda Waller gathers Ravan, [[Poison Ivy]] and [[Deadshot]] in an assassination mission of the LOA, a group that is planning to create a zombie army. The deal for the villains is simple: The three will help Waller in killing the LOA, and afterwards they are set free <ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #37-39</ref>.

The mission succeeds, and Amanda Waller goes to jail on charges of murder, while Ravan leaves for London, where he sets up a 'cyberchurch' as a front for his assassination organisation. A year later, Batman kidnaps Ravan from this 'church' (blowing it up in the process) for the new Suicide Squad run again by Amanda Waller <ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #41-43</ref>.

With this Squad Ravan goes to Israel in order to capture Kobra. But Kobra, had already been captured by the Israeli government's superteam the [[Hayoth]]. Ravan easily manipulates one of their agents, and thereby giving him access to their highly advanced [[Artificial Intelligence|A.I.]] computer Dybbuk. While Kobra's plans are being thwarted by the rest of the Suicide Squad, Ravan faces Kobra in combat, but Kobra has the upper hand and is close to killing Ravan.

At the last moment, [[Atom (comics)#Adam Cray|the third Atom]] appears on the scenes, striking down Kobra. Ravan's last wish is for either him or the Atom to kill Kobra, but Atom denies him that final wish, and as Ravan himself says, he dies unfulfilled. Ravan dies in ''Suicide Squad'' #47 <ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #45-47</ref>.
