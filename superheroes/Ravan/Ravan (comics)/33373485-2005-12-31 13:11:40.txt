==Character History==
'''Ravan''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[villain]]. First appearing in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #1 (1987), Ravan was a member of the villainous mercenary team [[Jihad (comics)|Jihad]], where an encounter with the [[Bronze Tiger]] left his back broken. In their second encounter with the [[Bronze Tiger]], Ravan was recruited for the [[Suicide Squad]].

Part of the [[thuggee]] cult, Ravan tried to stop the coming of Kali and thereby the Kali-Yuga, the Age of Chaos. By killing, he delays the coming of Kali another thousand years. It is through this practice that he both prevents and worships [[Kali]]. In this, his primary enemy was the villain [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] who wishes to bring forth that same Age. 

Ravan joined the Suicide Squad to continue these efforts while actually being sponsored by the American Government. He developed a strange bond with Bronze Tiger, who swore to kill, but in the meantime, the two formed an effective team. He was also instrumental to Amanda Waller's plan to finish of the LOA, who had exposed that the Suicide Squad was still being run by Amanda Waller (the general public had been led to believe a Mr. Kale had taken over, but he was only an actor, used as a front so that Waller could still run the Squad).

With the Suicide Squad on the verge of disbanding by her superiors, Amanda Waller gathered Ravan, [[Poison Ivy]] and [[Deadshot]] in an assassination mission of the LOA, who were now planning to create a zombie army. The deal was simple: The three would help Waller in killing the LOA, and afterwards they were set free.

The mission succeeded, and as Amanda Waller went to jail on charges of murder, Ravan left for London, where he set up a 'cyberchurch' as a front for his assassination organisation. A year later, Batman kidnapped Ravan from this 'church' (blowing it up in the process) for the new Suicide Squad run by Amanda Waller.

It was with that Squad that Ravan went to Israel in order to capture Kobra. Kobra had already been captured by that time by the Israeli's own superhumans, but they played right into Kobra's hands, giving him access to their highly advanced [[Artificial Intelligence|A.I.]] computer Dybbuk. While Kobra's plans were being thwarted by the rest of the Suicide Squad, Ravan faced Kobra in combat, but Kobra had the upper hand and was close to killing Ravan.

At the last moment the third Atom appeared on the scenes, striking down Kobra. Ravan's last wish was for either him or the Atom to kill Kobra, but Atom denied him that final wish, and as Ravan himself said, he died unfulfilled.

==Appearances==
Ravan was created in the Suicide Squad title and appeared exclusively alongside them, racking up a total of 22 appearances, of only 2 were outside of the Suicide Squad title ([[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm, the Nuclear Man]]) who were both involved in a Suicide Squad storyline.
