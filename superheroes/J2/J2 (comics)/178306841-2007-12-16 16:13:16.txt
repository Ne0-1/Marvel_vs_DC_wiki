'''J2''' ('''Zane Yama''') is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He exists in '''[[MC2]]''', an alternate future timeline of the main Marvel continuity and is the son of the former [[supervillain]] [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. J2 is a member of the future incarnation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[A-Next]]. J2 once had his own series, which lasted for twelve issues. He has made a few appearances in ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' (also set in the MC2 universe, starring the daughter of [[Spider-Man]]).

==Publication history==
After his initial appearance, '''J2''' ended up with his own self-titled ongoing series, however the series was cancelled after only 12 issues.
He also made appearances as a supporting character in the first series of ''A-Next'' as well as the limited series ''Last Hero Standing'' and ''Last Planet Standing''.

==Fictional character biography==
Zane Yama is the son of Cain Marko and Sachi Yama. When he was bullied by school bully Miller Hallendale, he discovered that he had inherited the powers of his father. J2 lived most of his younger life without the guidance of his father, Juggernaut, who had gone missing on a mission with the X-Men.

His father's powers, received from the mystical Ruby of Cyttorak, transform their wielder into a large behemoth with enchanted armor, granting amongst other things, super-strength and enhanced endurance. It is through an act of will that Zane can transform himself into a similar appearance, with armor which he had to fashion himself, also granting him super-strength and heightened endurance. A constant trademark of his costume is his father's [[flannel]] shirt tied around his waist.

Calling himself J2, Zane was offered membership to the group called A-Next, themselves also children of heroes, notably the Avengers. Although J2 was also offered membership with a group known as the Uncanny [[X-People]], led by an older Jubilee, he turned them down, albeit remaining friends with the team and assisting them on a few occasions. Similarly, Magneta, the self-styled mistress of magnetism, offered J2 a spot amongst the new villainous group she was forming, but she was also turned down.

J2 later learned of the reason behind his father's disappearance from [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], leader of the X-Men. Juggernaut, was being held prisoner by a villain called Nemesus in an alternate dimension. Thanks to the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] [[Doc Magus]], J2 was able to locate his father and then rescue him, reuniting his parents. Later announcing his retirement, Juggernaut was content to let J2 carry on his legacy, having proven himself worthy of the powers he wielded.

In the recent [[A-Next|Avengers Next]] series, J2 has professed an attraction to [[Thena (MC2)| Thena]], the daughter of [[Thor]], much to fellow A-Next member [[Bluestreak (comics)|Bluestreak]]'s chagrin.

==Powers and abilities==
J2 has the power to change from his normal teenaged form into a massively muscled form with nearly all of the powers of his father, the Juggernaut. He is superhumanly strong and durable, and once he starts moving, he is almost impossible to stop. In battle, he wears his father's helmet which protects his mind from [[telepathy|psychic]] assaults. His only limitation is that if he uses his powers for too long, he will uncontrollably revert to his normal human form.
