'''Cerebra''', whose real name is Shakti Haddad, is a founding member of the [[X-Men]] of [[Marvel 2099|2099]] and founder of X-Nation. She is a mutant from [[India]] whose powers are a form of [[telepathy]] that allows her to 'sense' mutants in a similar manner to [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s [[Cerebro]]. She also has the ability to manipulate a person's [[nervous system]] and paralyze them as well as stun and render them unconscious.

Shakti was first seen in the first issue of ''X-Men 2099''. In that issue, she recruited a mutant named Timothy Fitzgerald aka Skullfire. She played an important part in the X-Men of 2099 and founded the X-Nation in Halo City.  X-Nation was a team of teenage mutants that included December and Wulff. In ''2099 World of Tomorrow'', Shakti lost her mutant powers and the use of her legs by Franklin, a robot who also destroyed her nervous system. Shakti's father is Indian scientist Zail Haddad who is a biochemist. Although Zail repaired her nervous sytem, Cerebra did not regain her mutant powers or the use of her legs. Towards the end of the series, it was revealed Shakti was pregnant but this was never explained as the series was cancelled soon after.

'''Cerebra''' is also the name of an improved version of Cerebro introduced in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''New X-Men''.
