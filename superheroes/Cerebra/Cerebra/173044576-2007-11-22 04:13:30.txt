'''Cerebra''' ('''Shakti Haddad''') is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[comic book]] character in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]]. She is a founding member of the [[X-Men 2099]] of [[Marvel 2099|2099]] and founder of [[X-Nation 2099]]. Her creators were [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] and [[Ron Lim]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Shakti Haddad''' was the daughter of Zail Haddad, a powerful and ruthless businessman, whose company did many twisted [[Genetics|genetic]] experiments on innocents for their own profit. Shakti was a brilliant young woman and became an expert in genetics, but her compassionate nature made her oppose her father's company. She fled her native land of [[India]] and Zail sent various bounty hunters after his daughter. One of these bounty hunters fell in love with Shakti, and together the two escaped, but he was suffering a lethal disease and left her before the disease would kill him. Years later, she would meet him again, when he called himself the ''Architect''.

Cerebra became a founding member of the futuristic version of the [[X-Men]] gathered together by [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an Chi Xan]] and a mainstay throughout the series. However, most of her support was not in combat but was behind the scenes. When she is first introduced, she recruited a mutant named Timothy Fitzgerald aka [[Skullfire]] into the fold.

Shakti's codename, Cerebra, was coined by [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] as a joke, referring to her ability to locate mutants being similar to the original X-Men's [[Cerebro]]. 

Later Cerebra showed up during the battle with '''Master Zhao''' and his group of Chosen X-Men. Zhao had used unstable technology to further mutate his chosen group in order for them to more closely resemble the group of original X-Men ([[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey| Marvel Girl]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Archangel (comics)| Angel]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]) but this process had left the unwilling guinea pigs in a condition where their cellular structure was deteriorating. After the battle when this fact was discovered, Cerebra went about trying to find a way to cure their condition by placing them in [[cryogenics| cryogenic suspension]]. It became a pet project for her and almost cost her her life. When Xi'an finally turned on the team, the [[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]] came to collect the three surviving mutants, just after Shakti had discovered a way to save the three. Shakti tried to stop them, but was knocked out by Xi'an. He set explosives in Master Zhao's old base, but Shakti woke up in time to wake the other X-Men and escape the base before it exploded.

Soon afterwards the X-Men attacked the Theatre of Pain and Xi'an was restored to his old self and the X-Men were made the protectors of '''Halo City'''. Shakti's father, Zail, sought refuge in Halo City from the Graverobber, a former employee who had been turned into a corpse-like [[zombie]] due to Zail's negligence. The Graverobber and his Undead took Halo City hostage and the Halo City administrator, '''Morphine Somers''', used Zail as bait to capture the Graverobber. Due to Morphine's plan, Zail was seriously wounded, but survived and Shakti and Zail made peace.

[[Doom 2099| President Doom]] came to Shakti with a rumor of a soon-to-come mutant [[Messiah]]. He or she was supposed to come in the body of a young child, so Doom wanted to ensure that the young savior would be in his hands. He gave Shakti the task of collecting and training these children in Halo City and thus [[X-Nation 2099|X-Nation]] was born. Shakti taught some classes and gave [[anger management]] [[counseling]]. Unfortunately the team was torn apart by a combination of the revived [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and the invading [[Atlantis| Atlantean]] army. The water-breathers, incurring heavy fatallities, kill the staff of the X-Nation orphanage, the Sisterhood of the Howling Commandos. The kids are left homeless.
 
Around this time, Shakti learns she is pregnant but the fate of her child is not made clear.

In the follow-up limited series [[2099: World of Tomorrow]], Shakti's nervous system is attacked by Franklin, a robot who was created by [[Reed Richards]] to store the world's knowledge. Shakti loses her mutant power and the use of her legs. Shakti's father was able to repair the damage done to her nervous system, but could not restore her mutant powers or the use of her legs. She became one of the members of the new colony in the [[Savage Land]] which finally seemed to bring humans and mutants together peacefully.

==Powers and abilities==
Shakti possesses a specific form of [[telepathy]] that allows her to 'sense' mutants in a similar manner to [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s [[Cerebro]]. She also has the ability to manipulate a person's [[nervous system]] and paralyze them as well as stun and render them unconscious or access any [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic functions]], like [[Skullfire]]'s powers before he learned to control them.
Shakti has a small implant below her left ear that allows her to directly connect to computers and the Cybernet, the 2099 version of the internet.
Shakti also is brilliant scientist and a skilled martial artist.
