'''Mr. Fish''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is an enemy of [[Luke Cage]]. He appeared in ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #29. He died in ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #29.
==Character biography==
Mr. Fish was once an ordinary human being and a petty lacky of organized crime. For some reason he thought it would be a good idea to steal radio-active material from the Maggia. The same excellent judgement lead him to examine the radioactive material up-close with no protection from its dangerous effects. Why he did this when he had neither expertise in science nor a means to productively use the material is a mystery that died with him.

Shortly after acquiring the material he got dizzy and fell with it into the East River where he mutated into a Fish Man. This mutagenic process endowed him with an amphibious physiology and enhanced strength. Mr. Fish then decided to use his powers to advance his status in the criminal underworld. Somehow he acquired a sophisticated ray-gun, which was able to completely disintegrate a person's clothing. He next wisely decided to choose a midget, "Shrike", as his second in command knowing the fear and respect this would instill in his criminal lackeys. He also chose a costume strongly reminiscent of DC comics Aquaman.

Mr. Fish was aware that some people would mock his looks, leading to him often say: ''"No one laughs at Mr. Fish!"'' In his one and only battle with Luke Cage, Mr. Fish apparently fell to his death (an incident resulting from his accidentally charging off of a sky-scraper).

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of the mutagenic process his body went through, Mr. Fish was amphibious; able to breathe on land and in water. As he was able to fight Powerman he presumably had enhanced strength. 

Mr. Fish carried a sophisticated ray-gun. Based on his origin and his death, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Fish was [[Mental_retardation|mentally challenged]] and possessed a marked deficit for tactical judgement.
