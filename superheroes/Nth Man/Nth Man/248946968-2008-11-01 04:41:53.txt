==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Thomas Lightner was a scientist who rebuilt his father's Sky Cannon after his father Raymond disappeared during a mishap with the device.  A similar mishap with the rebuilt device caused the energies from Raymond to merge with Thomas, giving Thomas the powers of a black hole.  Thomas' body could not contain these vast energies for long, and he collapsed and returned to his normal form.

Lightner was later contacted by the Nth Command to infilatrate and sabotage [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]].  Lightner hoped to use the project's Nth Projector to regain his previous powers.  Lightner released [[Nuklo]] and allowed [[Thundra]] and the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]] in to cause destruction and distract the facility's staff.  Lightner was supposed to use the Nth Projector to send the Project: Pegasus facility into another dimension, but instead used it on himself.  Lightner was transformed into the '''Nth Man''', a "living interdimensional vortex."  Like a black hole, the Nth Man absorbs all nearby matter and energy into himself.  All of the heroes at the facility were absorbed into him, and [[Wundarr the Aquarian]] was able to use his null field to shut off the Nth Man's powers.<ref>Marvel Two-in-One #58</ref>

Instead of being destroyed, the Nth Man entered the alternate Earth of [[Earth-712|Earth-S]].  There, he threatened to consume the sun, but the [[Squadron Supreme]] defeated him at great cost and were banished to [[Earth-616]] for a time.
