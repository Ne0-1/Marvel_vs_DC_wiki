'''Ravage''' is a fictional villain at the [[Marvel Comics]].  He is also one of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk's]] enemies.  Ravage's real name is '''Professor Crawford'''.

==Character Bio==
Dr. Geoffrey Crawford was a physics professor at Desert State University who took undergraduate Bruce Banner under his wing and became his mentor. Years later Banner went to his teacher for aid in finding a cure for the Hulk. At this point in time Crawford was an sick man, but nevertheless was still able to create a machine that could be used to filter the Gamma radiation from Bruce's body. Crawford also saw this as a way to cure himself. By obtaining some of the Hulk's DNA, he knew he would be able to use the Hulk's recuperative powers on himself. First Crawford reconfigured his own DNA so that it was a match with Bruce's. This turned him into a stronger beast than the Hulk. The monster called Ravage.

Ravage is stronger than the Hulk and is even slightly larger. The key element which makes Ravage such a dangerous enemy is the fact that he still has Dr. Crawford's mind and also a lust for power. Ravage attacked Hulk just after his first transformation, but soon turned back into Crawford at sunrise. Crawford turned Banner over to General Ross for fear of being stopped from becoming Ravage again. 

Crawford adjusted the machine so that it would change him into Ravage permanently. When this was done Ravage attacked the University and terrorized all who had pitied him as Dr. Crawford. Ravage was only stopped when the Hulk and General Ross formed an unlikely alliance that allowed the army to trap the villain in a state of suspended animation.

Ravage was set to reappear in future issues and become a more monsterous creature, but due to the cancellation of the Rampaging Hulk title, this story never materialized.       

==Powers and Abilities==
Like Bruce Banner, Crawford also got exposed to gamma radiation.  Like the Hulk, Crawford has superhuman strength which he uses to battle the Hulk. It also seems that he has strong leg muscles like the Hulk which allows him to leap great distances.

==Other Media==
In the [[Hulk (video game)|2003 video game]], Crawford appears as Bruce Banner's mentor. In the game, he found a cure for the Hulk by using the gamma orb, which weakens the Hulk. Then, the military plans to use it to defeat the Hulk. Crawford tells Banner to get to his lab before the military does. This version of Crawford is that he is confined on a wheelchair and attempts to regain his health to walk again. When getting to the lab, it was revealed that Crawford is just using Banner to get gamma radiation for him. As Ravage, Crawford can walk and run. He also has many of the Hulk's abilities, including superhuman strength and a healing ability. In his boss fight, Ravage can regain his health during a fight. When defeated by the Hulk during his last boss fight, he reverts back to his human form. At the end of the game, Crawford is seen apparently trying to get more gamma radiation but his search fails.

In the game Dr. Crawford/Ravage is voiced by Dion Luther.
