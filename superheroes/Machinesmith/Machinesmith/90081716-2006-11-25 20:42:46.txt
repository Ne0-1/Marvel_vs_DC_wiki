'''Machinesmith''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He specializes in [[robot]]ics, and is able to make convincing [[Doppelg√§nger|doubles]] of other superhumans. His own [[mind]] was later transferred to a robotic body.

==History==
Starr Saxon's original efforts saw to his use of his robotics and enginnering abilities to construct a variety of androids to be used as assassins for hire/personal gain. At some point during this period, he constructed a facsimile of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and a variety of robotic "mutant" drones called [[The Demi Men]] who went on to battle the [[X-Men]]. The Magneto-Robot would appear several times over the years, believing itself to be the true Magneto, until it was destroyed by a [[Sentinel]]. As of this writing, the individual(s) who commissioned Saxon for the creation of the robot is unrevealed, but fan speculation has suggested Magneto himself.

Saxon's next noteworthy campaigns saw to the use of a powerful android in a series of crimes in New York. He was opposed by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].  Saxon decided to confront Daredevil directly. He murdered the original [[Mr. Fear]] and stole his costume and weaponry. As Mr. Fear, Saxon battled Daredevil and lost, falling to his death from a flying platform.

Saxon's robots found his dying body and transferred his consciousness into a computer, from which he could control into a variety of android bodies. Now calling himself the Machinesmith, Saxon or his robots would come into conflict with a variety of superheroes.

Machinesmith would come to the exclusive employ of [[Red Skull|The Red Skull]], for whom he served as his primary scientist/machinist. On several occasions, Machinesmith would undertake various field missions for the Skull, usually confronting [[Captain America]].

A portion of the Machinesmith consciousness was eventually captured, (assumed to be Saxon's entire consciousness), and enslaved by Tony Stark when he was under the thrall of [[Kang the Conquerer]]. Machinesmith later claimed to have easily recovered the lost fragment and reassimilated it.

When the Skull was blasted apart by the destruction of the Kubekult's [[Cosmic Cube]], Machinesmith enacted a series of protocols dictated by the Skull to kill Captain America and plunge the world into nuclear holocaust. Machinesmith was defeated.

Later, Machinesmith came under the employ of the Crimson Cowl's [[Masters of Evil]]. After the defeat of the team by the [[Thunderbolts]], Machinesmith has since lain low. His current activities are unknown.
