'''Machinesmith''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He specializes in [[robot]]ics, and is able to make convincing [[Doppelg√§nger|doubles]] of other superhumans. His own [[mind]] was later transferred to a robotic body.

==Fictional character biography==
Starr Saxon was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  His original efforts saw to his use of his robotics and engineering abilities to construct a variety of androids to be used as assassins for hire/personal gain. At some point during this period, he constructed a facsimile of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and a variety of robotic "mutant" drones called [[The Demi Men]] who went on to battle the [[X-Men]]. The Magneto-Robot would appear several times over the years, believing itself to be the true Magneto, until it was destroyed by a [[Sentinel]]. As of this writing, the individual(s) who commissioned Saxon for the creation of the robot is unrevealed, but fan speculation has suggested Magneto himself.

Saxon's next noteworthy campaigns saw to the use of a powerful android in a series of crimes in New York. He was opposed by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].  Saxon decided to confront Daredevil directly. He murdered the original [[Mister Fear]] and stole his costume and weaponry. As Mister Fear, Saxon battled Daredevil and lost, falling to his death from a flying hovercraft platform.

Saxon's robots found his dying body and transferred his brain patterns and consciousness into a computer, from which he could control into a variety of android bodies. Now calling himself the Machinesmith, Saxon or his robots would come into conflict with a variety of superheroes.

He came to despise his artificial "life", but since his programming prevents him from committing suicide, he attempted for a while to have others bring about his destruction.

Machinesmith would come to the exclusive employ of the [[Red Skull]], for whom he served as his primary scientist/machinist and member of the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]]. On several occasions, Machinesmith would undertake various field missions for the Skull, usually confronting [[Captain America]].

A portion of the Machinesmith consciousness was eventually captured, (assumed to be Saxon's entire consciousness), and enslaved by Tony Stark when he was under the thrall of [[Kang the Conquerer]]. Machinesmith later claimed to have easily recovered the lost fragment and re-assimilated it.

When the Skull was blasted apart by the destruction of the Kubekult's [[Cosmic Cube]], Machinesmith enacted a series of protocols dictated by the Skull to kill Captain America and plunge the world into nuclear holocaust. Machinesmith was defeated.

Later, Machinesmith came under the employ of the Crimson Cowl's [[Masters of Evil]]. After the defeat of the team by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Machinesmith has since lain low. His current activities are unknown.

[[Barry Windsor-Smith]] has stated that back in ''Daredevil'' #50, Saxon was supposed to be presented as gay; however, he admits that his art wasn't good enough to get the point across. <ref name="fivehundred">{{Citation | last = Conroy | first = Mike | date = 2004 | title = 500 Comic Book Villains | publisher = Barron's | isbn = 0764129082 }}</ref>  Other issues have since revealed his sexuality more directly, such as ''Captain America'' #368 and ''Iron Man'' #320.

==Powers and equipment==
Machinesmith's previous robotic body possesses superhuman strength enabling it to lift (press) approximately 1 ton. Presumably Machinesmith could build a body with a greater capacity for strength.

Machinesmith exists as a living, cybernetic-system program, which is equipped to transmit its program along an infrared laser beam from one robotic body to another within .25 seconds. Machinesmith can even place his personal program (personality) into multiple bodies at the same time. His physical properties vary in accordance with the robot form he is inside. He has yet to inhabit a robot body greatly superior to a standard human-mimicking robot's capacity. Machinesmith is a genius at creating complex behavioral programs and bionic systems.

Machinesmith has also created a vast arsenal of weaponry, defense systems, and surveillance devices, whose specifications are constantly upgraded.
