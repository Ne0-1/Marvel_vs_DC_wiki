June Covington started out as a post-grad student who was bored with her life working at a University and had been watching boxed DVD sets. She later met a biologist named Edward Wynne who had a birth defect on his left arm. June then decided to take up an interest in getting rid of genetic imperfections and became a scientist. After a few genetic failures and finally testing on herself, June was able to perfect her own genetics. A year later, she met Edward Wynne again and presented him with a gift. Edward rejected her gift and methods and handed her over to the police. June's lab was shut down and was thrown out of the university. Sometime later, June encountered Edward again, claiming that she had changed in order to prove herself. She lured Edward to a lab where she injected a genetic plug into him, which paralyzed his body. After inducing cranial explosive failure on 18 people during a prayer meeting for special needs children, Dr. June Covington was apprehended by the authorities.
