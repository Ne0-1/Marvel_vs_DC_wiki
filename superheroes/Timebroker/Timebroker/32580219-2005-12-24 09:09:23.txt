The Timebroker is a fictional character created by [[Judd Winick]] for the comic book [[Exiles]]. "He" is a psychic construct created by a race of alien bug-people who accidentally damaged a large number of alternate universes. The Timebroker first appeared in [[Exiles#1]], when he invited the [[Age of Apocalypse]] version of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] to join a group of dimension-lost superheroes whom he named, "The Exiles," whose mission would be to repair the damaged realities, and hopefully, to return home safely.   

To repair each damaged reality, the Exiles must complete a mission given to them by the Timebroker through a communications device called, "The [[Tallus]]," worn by the leader of the group, be it [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]], or [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. These missions are usually humanitarian or super-heroic in nature, but sometimes involve assassination. The Timebroker also created a separate team of lost heroes, called [[Weapon X]], whose job is mainly wetwork.  

A team member whose home reality is repaired is immediately sent home, and replaced with someone new.

Recently, the Exiles received a warning: "Beware the [[Timebreakers]]." They learned later the true nature of "The Timebroker," namely that "he" is an illusion created by bug-men. He has not been mentioned since the bugs were introduced, and they are still known as "The Timebreakers."
