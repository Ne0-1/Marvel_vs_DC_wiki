The '''Timebroker''' is a fictional character created by [[Judd Winick]] for the comic book [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]; a psychic construct created by the [[Timebreaker]]s, a race of alien bug-people who accidentally damaged a large number of alternate universes. 

The Timebroker first appeared in Exiles #1, when he invited the [[Age of Apocalypse]] version of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] to join a group of dimension-lost superheroes whom he named "The Exiles", whose mission would be to repair the damaged realities, and hopefully, to return home safely. A team member whose home reality is repaired is immediately sent home, and replaced with someone new.

To repair each damaged reality, the Exiles must complete a mission given to them by the Timebroker through a communications device called, "The [[Tallus]]," worn by the leader of the group, be it [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]], or [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]]. These missions are usually humanitarian or super-heroic in nature, but sometimes involve assassination. 

The Timebroker also created a separate team of lost heroes, called [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]], whose job is mainly wetwork. When they grew out of control, the Timebroker ordered the Exiles and Weapon X to battle each other until only 6 remained alive. 

Recently, the Exiles received a warning: "Beware the Timebreakers." Almost immediately after, the Timebroker acted irrational, giving orders to murder the [[Age of Apocalypse]] X-Men as well as the Exiles' [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]]. He also did not pop in when Tanaraq and Holocaust attempted to rebel and get their old lives back. The Exiles learned later the true nature of the Timebroker during a raid on Panoptichron, namely that "he" is an illusion created by bug-men. Mimic used him to convince Blink and the others to cast the infiltrating Hyperion back to his original Earth during a raid on Panoptichron. Heather Hudson used the Tallus in #78 to tell the Exiles and Squadron Supreme about each other to save the Exiles from life in prison. The Timebroker was last seen in #84 firing the Exiles.
