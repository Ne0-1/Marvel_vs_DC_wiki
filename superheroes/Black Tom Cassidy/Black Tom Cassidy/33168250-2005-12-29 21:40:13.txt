'''Black Tom Cassidy''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  His first appearance was a cameo in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #99 (in shadow) and he was fully introduced in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #101. He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Character biography==
Black Tom is the cousin of Sean Cassidy, the [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], a member of the [[X-Men]].  He was also once the only friend of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].  His original principal power was that he could generate blasts of heat through a [[wood]]en medium, such as the [[shillelagh]] that he is often found carrying.  He has a rivalry with Sean, mainly because Sean won both Cassidy Keep, their estate, and the family fortune from Tom in a game of dice.  They were also rivals for a woman named Maeve Rourke, whom Sean married.

While Sean was away, working for [[INTERPOL]], Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa. Not much later, Maeve died in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean, Tom took care of Theresa. When Sean returned to learn of his wifeâ€™s death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve. While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

Later Tom became a criminal and came into conflict with the law and was apprehended. While serving time in prison, Tom met and befriended [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. The two became close friends and allies, and worked together on missions. On a mission in [[San Francisco]] with Juggernaut and Theresa (now under the codename [[Siryn]]), Tom encountered and fought the original [[Spider-Woman]], along with several of the X-Men. This conflict ended in Black Tom's temporary capture. While in custody, Black Tom exonerated Theresa of responsibility for her crimes and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was. The X-Men brought Theresa back to their headquarters, where she was joyfully reunited with her father. 

After being shot by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Tom was taken to [[France]], where doctors grafted a wood-like substance onto his wounds, healing him and allowing him to channel his bio-blasts directly through his fists. Unfortunately, due to a genetic virus the substance spread over Tom's body, and only the mutated cells of the mercenary [[Deadpool]] (due to his healing factor) were able to help Tom stop the spread of the plant growth.

The effect of Deadpool's cells did not last for long. The spreading began again, to the point where Tom is now completely composed of plant matter. As a result, his powers now include control and manipulation of all manner of plant life, to the point where he can make plant dopplegangers of himself, or anyone else. He is completely insane as a result. 

Recently, Black Tom resurfaced as a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Earlier, Juggernaut had inflitrated the X-Men for him as part of the Brotherhood's plan, though Juggernaut slowly changed during his time with the X-Men, mostly due to the positive influence of the young boy Sammy Pare.

Juggernaut rejoined the Brotherhood, secretly planning on turning them when the time was right. Sammy stumbled upon the group, and assuming that Juggernaut was betraying the X-Men ,started lashing out. In retaliation Tom brutally murdered the boy, causing Juggernaut to attack Cassidy, dismembering him. Due to Tom's new connection with plants, this did not hurt him.

Juggernaut managed to escape and warn the X-Men, while Black Tom led an attack on the X-Mansion. Besides killing the school's cook, their mission was a failure. In the end [[Xorn]] sucked Black Tom and the rest of the Brotherhood into a [[black hole]]. His fate remains uncertain.

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, his principal power was that he could generate concussive blasts of destructive force through any wooden medium. He typically carried a wooden shillelagh, a traditional Irish fighting stick.

At present his bodily chemistry, physiology, and morphology have radically changed. He does not demonstrate his original abilities. He is now a humanoid plant life form capable of living in several different bodies and infesting folliage and trees to make them a part of his body. 

He is very difficult to restrain or destroy because it is nearly impossible to destroy every part of his body as much of it remains underground and he can invade other plants with his life force.
