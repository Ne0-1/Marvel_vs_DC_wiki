'''Black Tom Cassidy''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is the cousin of Sean Cassidy, the [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], a member of the [[X-Men]].  He is also the only friend of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].  He can generate blasts of heat through a [[wood]]en medium, such as the [[shillelagh]] that he is often found carrying.  He has a rivalry with Sean, mainly because Sean won both Cassidy Keep, their estate, and the family fortune from Tom in a game of dice.  They were also rivals for a woman named Maeve Rourke, whom Sean married, although the [[IRA]] later killed Rourke while Sean was away, working for [[INTERPOL]].  Tom rescued and raised her daughter, Theresa, who later became the [[superhero]]ine called [[Siryn]].  After being maimed by the mutant called [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Tom had wood grafted onto his body so that he could generate energy blasts without having to carry wood on his person, and he has since transformed his entire body into plant matter.  Tom was recently a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] alongside the Juggernaut.
