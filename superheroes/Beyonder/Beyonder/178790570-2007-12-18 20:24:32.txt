The '''Beyonder''' is a [[character (fiction)|fictional character]] in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].  He first appeared in ''[[Secret Wars]]'' vol. 1 #1 (May 1984), and was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Mike Zeck]]. He reappears in ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #1 (July 1985), which was created by Jim Shooter and [[Al Milgrom]]. 

==Publication history==
The Beyonder was a controversial character among creators.  Creators felt that [[Jim Shooter]] had abused his role as editor-in-chief, and forced the use of the omnipotent character upon other writers and editors.  Some critics felt the crossovers didn't always mesh well with the main book.  One of the most vocal critics was [[John Byrne]].

Apparently, [[Steve Englehart]] wanted to tie in the Beyonder to older characters known as the Beyonders (first mentioned in the team-up comic ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #63, beings powerful enough to collect planets) for his "Secret Wars III' story in ''Fantastic Four'' #318-319. According to Englehart, an editor hated the character and ordered the Beyonder "removed" from the Marvel Universe. Englehart did as asked but has stated that he tried to exile the character with dignity. The character was subjected to a [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] making him less potent than originally determined, and explanations of his omnipotence have been written off as the more powerful beings "playing along" to ease the Beyonder's transition into self-awareness. It was explained in Secret Wars III that the Beyonder was in fact a [[Cosmic Cube]]. During the first Secret War, the Beyonder claimed to be the embodiment of an entire universe.  As he became self-aware, he recognized himself as the only person in his universe. Secret Wars III revealed that the Beyonder is in fact a wayward Cosmic Cube, at one time inhabiting his own "dimension" because there was no matrix to hold his energy. The Beyonder took his name from the powerful Beyonders who were manipulating his destiny.

==Fictional character biography==
===Secret Wars===
The Beyonder is the sum total of a pocket dimension called the Beyond-Realm or simply "Beyond", hence the name "Beyonder".  This dimension is accidentally accessed by nebbish lab technician Owen Reece.  Part of the energy from the dimension escaped and imbued Reece with near-infinite powers, which he wielded as the villainous [[Molecule Man]] - potentially one of the most powerful villains in the [[Marvel Universe]].  The remaining energy of the pocket dimension apparently gains sentience and curiosity.  Using its vast powers, the Beyonder creates a planet called "Battleworld" out of pieces of various planets (one such piece being a suburb of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]) and abducts a number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s from [[Earth]] so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil that rages within humanity at large.

In initially explaining the nature of the experiment to the involuntary participants, the entity identifies itself only as "I am from beyond."  The name "Beyonder" is quickly applied by [[Galactus]] and adopted by all others present.  Galactus, sensing that the Beyonder could alleviate his perpetual hunger, immediately and aggressively charges into the Beyond-Realm through a dimensional rift, followed by [[Doctor Doom]], who seeks power for his own purposes.  Both are repelled, but the information gathered by Doom later enables him to use the body of the sound-based villain [[Klaw]] as a medium to steal the energies of Galactus' Worldship and then the power of the Beyonder itself.  With the Beyonder's power, Doom constructs a 200-mile high tower of golden stone as temporary quarters, and then stated that he has given up his ambitions for conquest, instead simply being content with freeing his mother's soul from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. The Beyonder's consciousness then possesses Klaw's damaged mind and manipulates Doom into unconsciously squandering his power against the superheroes, distracting him enough for the Beyonder to steal his power back.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12</ref>

This formed the basis of the first ''Secret Wars'' twelve-issue limited series.  The series sold incredibly well with circulation reaching up to 750,000 copies per issue, numbers reminiscent of the height of comic book sales during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] of the 1940s.

===Secret Wars II===
Due to the high sales of the first series, a second ''Secret Wars'' series, the nine-issue ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' miniseries, was published.  This series [[fictional crossover|crossed over]] into almost every comic that Marvel was publishing at the time.  

Intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars, the Beyonder comes to Earth to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand.  He creates a human body for himself; originally this body resembles an amalgam of parts of various super-beings.  He then changes it to be a duplicate of [[Captain America]]. He also transformed a human into [[Thundersword]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #1</ref> The Beyonder later patterns his hairstyle and wardrobe after [[Michael Jackson]]'s look as [[Captain EO]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

He has a complete lack of understanding of human biology and society, which leads to numerous difficult situations, some serious and some humorous. For instance, he needs to learn by example the difference between edible objects and non-edible ones, and needs to be toilet-trained by [[Spider-Man]].  When he learns about the monetary system from a homeless woman and [[Luke Cage]], the Hero for Hire, he transformed the Manhattan Heroes for Hire office building into gold as thanks for their assistance.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #2</ref>  He later comes under the influence of a criminal named Vinnie and becomes the head of a criminal cartel; he then used [[mind control]] to assume control over the entire Earth, only to relinquish control when he grew restless and frustrated with the lack of free will that the world now displayed.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #3</ref>  He then transforms the elf Algrim into [[Kurse]]. The Beyonder has a brief love affair with the musician [[Dazzler]], and, when pondering his place and needs in the universe, accidentally inspires a cult of meditation.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #4</ref>  His body is destroyed, or nearly destroyed, several times over, although each time he would repair it with his powers.

On a train to New York, Beyonder meets the mutant Tabitha Smith, also known as [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]]. Thinking he is a mutant, Boom Boom accompanies him. The Beyonder abandons her but returns and takes her to Xavier's school. At the school, Tabitha is terrified when the teams of the X-Men and the New Mutants fight the Beyonder. The Beyonder takes her to a planet where the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] are located. There, threatening to destroy the universe, the Beyonder fights and seemingly defeats a number of Celestials. (However, that planet was not truly the Celestials' headquarters, and the Celestials allowed the Beyonder to "defeat" them, presumably in order to observe him in action.  This, however, is part of the retcon.) Fearful of the battle taking place between the Beyonder and the Celestials, Tabitha demands to be returned to Earth. Back on Earth, Boom Boom alerts the Avengers about the Beyonder. Summoning the Beyonder, Boom Boom thereby leads him into an ambush by the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and other costumed champions. The Beyonder, who had regarded Boom Boom as his only friend, allows the Avengers to defeat him, but then leaves. Boom Boom leaves during the battle.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #5</ref>

He then acted in an attempt to "preserve life" throughout the universe by seemingly eliminating and then resurrecting the manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6</ref> Throughout the course of the series, the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] seeks to steal his powers or to destroy him to win the favor of Death.  Mephisto sends an army of supervillains to attack the Beyonder, who is saved by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #7</ref> The Beyonder then fought the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #273; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #111</ref>

The Beyonder then feels the futility of all his efforts and decides to destroy the entire multiverse.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #8</ref> He starts by killing the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #37</ref> He then battles [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #203</ref>

The Beyonder reconsiders destroying the multiverse, and resurrects the New Mutants.  The Beyonder tried to create for himself a mortal human infant body that could retain his omnipotence; although he was on the verge of succeeding, he is killed in the process by the [[Molecule Man]].  The Beyonder's near-limitless power is returned to the now-empty "Beyond-Realm", where it forms a [[Big Bang]] and created a new pocket universe<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #9</ref>.

===Deadpool Team-up===
Long after the Secret Wars two crossover had ended, a [[Deadpool]] special featured the "Secret Wars II continues in this issue" corner tag that was used during that original storyline.  In this issue, a younger less experience Deadpool is hired by the [[Kingpin]] to kill the Beyonder.  The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying "to be continued in Secret Wars III." This storyline is yet to be followed up on.

===Kosmos & Maker===
The tale of the Beyonder continued several years later when it is revealed that the energy which comprised the Beyonder and the energy that gave the [[Molecule Man]] his powers needed to be combined in order to create the basis for a mentally stable, mature high-omnipotent being to be born. The Beyonder then merged with the Molecule Man.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #319, in a story called "Secret Wars 3"</ref>  This being, called [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]], expelled the Molecule Man from its form, and returned him to Earth. Kosmos took on a female form and tutored under [[Kubik]], touring the universe together.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23</ref>  When the Molecule Man's lover, Volcana, left him, Owen Reece got angry, extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos, and proceeded to attack him until Kubik intervened.

At some unknown point, Kosmos went mad and assumed a mortal form, now calling itself the Maker.  After the Maker destroyed a [[Shi'ar]] colony, the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] managed to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the [[Kyln]].  The Maker's madness took control of several inmates, but was finally subdued by the nihilist [[Thanos]] and several of his allies among the prisoners.  Thanos confronted the Maker and psychically shut down its mind, instructing the Shi'ar that the body should be kept alive, brain-dead, or the Beyonder essence would go free again.

Apparently, Thanos had encountered the Beyonder in the past, but this was never explained, as Thanos was dead at the time of Secret Wars II (of course, one of the Beyonder's many powers included [[time travel]] as well, so a past meeting with a younger Thanos of Titan would have been entirely possible). Thanos' flashback showed Thanos as a youngster.  This may have been a plot writer [[Keith Giffen]] would have elaborated on in the future.

===Beyond! and Annihilation===
The Beyonder apparently returned in the series named after him, [[Beyond!]][http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=64644]. This being was called The Beyonder in the second issue.  This "Beyonder" was once again in command of the patchwork Battleworld, where it would be revealed that he had been collecting various superhumans and pitting them in combat with one another.  Eventually, the pool of heroes and villains featured in the mini-series discover that this Beyonder is actually the [[Stranger (comics)| Stranger]], who has been conducting studies of super-humanity through re-creations of the original Secret War.

In the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" crossover, the former Herald of Galactus, the [[Fallen One]], now under the control of Thanos, is sent to investigate the aftermath of the Kyln's destruction by the Annihilation Wave and ascertain the Beyonder's fate; the Fallen One soon finds her lifeless form in the rubble.
However, given the strange nature of her existence as a Cosmic Cube, as well as the fact that she was killed once before in [[Secret Wars II]] without apparent ill effect (the Cosmic Cube energy that was the original Beyonder simply filling up an empty pocket dimension where it was shunted to and starting life anew), it is uncertain at this time if she truly died, or if instead she has been set free as Thanos predicted.

===New Avengers: The Illuminati===
[[Image:Beyonder.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The Beyonder in his human form.<br>Art by [[Jim Cheung|Jimmy Cheung]].]]
In ''New Avengers: The Illuminati'' #3, featuring a re-telling of past events, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] reveals that in the original Secret War, he had initially planned to use his powers to make everyone fall asleep and thus buy him and Reed Richards time to formulate an escape plan, but feared the Beyonder's wrath. However, he immediately sensed a strange mental presence and attempted to mind-scan the Beyonder, revealing him as one of the [[Inhumans]] previously ruled over by fellow Illuminati member [[Black Bolt]]. The apparent secret behind the Beyonder's seemingly godlike abilities was also deduced by Xavier, who recognized that the Beyonder had been a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Inhuman, like Xavier and his own team of X-Men, and the exposure of his mutant genes to [[Terrigen Mist]]s had created an unprecedented reaction, bestowing upon him more amazing power and knowledge than all other Inhumans of his time.<ref>[http://www.popcultureshock.com/new-avengers-illuminati-3/41826/ New Avengers: Illuminati #3 Preview]</ref>

This revelation leads to a confrontation with the Beyonder during the events of the second Secret War, wherein Black Bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the Beyonder's activities.  When encountered, the Beyonder is dwelling in a simulacrum of Manhattan Island on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[asteroid belt]].  The scene playing out is one from the Secret Wars II series (the destruction of Power Man and Iron Fist's headquarters).  At the 2007 Philadelphia Comic-Con, writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] admitted the asteroid scene was deliberately vague, allowing readers to draw their own connections to Secret Wars II.  He also claimed he did not receive enough credit for maintaining the character's 1987 jeri-curl.

Solicitations for the Illuminati miniseries suggest that the Beyonder will return by the series' end in a current day storyline.

The story itself is deliberately ambiguous; Black Bolt, for example, does not remember the mutant Inhuman who vanished, making it possible the Beyonder arranged all this as a mind game.  The story's connection to modern continuity is unclear: the scene depicted on the asteroid is one which remains in continuity, as does the revelation of the Beyonder as a Cosmic Cube in Secret Wars III.

==Powers and abilities==
Although not native to this dimension, the Beyonder was one of the most powerful beings ever to exist in the Marvel Universe. In the original Secret Wars storyline he was the be-all and end-all of his universe that took corporeal form to better understand the nature of human beings. After his creator, [[Jim Shooter]], left Marvel, writer-editor Tom DeFalco, displeased with Shooter's tenure at Marvel, re-tooled the Beyonder and altered his origin. He was no longer [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] as many initially believed, being an incomplete [[Cosmic Cube]], with less raw power and the same limitations of a complete cube. Nonetheless, he possessed vast psionic abilities allowing him to manipulate matter and energy at a cosmic level beyond all but only the most powerful of [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]]. He once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first Secret Wars, although [[Molecule Man]] later recreated the stars in it, while transporting the city of Denver and the Super-Villains back to Earth. When the latter extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos their battle took place in more than three dimensions, and threatened vast portions of reality. In Kosmos' 'Maker' incarnation she was stated as capable of reversing [[Anti-matter#Antiuniverse|The Crunch]] itself, essentially collapsing the entire universe. The Beyonder could endow himself with a corporeal form of practically limitless strength and endurance. He had the potential to reach near [[omniscience]] as well, but he died before his mind could reach maturity.

==In other media==
[[Image:Beyonderspider.png‎|thumb|The Beyonder in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
The Beyonder makes an appearance in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon during the early 90's. However, his appearance in the cartoon greatly differs from his normal comics, as wear the brief "super hero" costume the Beyonder wore in Secret Wars II along with a new haircut and a goatee as opposed to having a clean-shaven face with a disco outfit.  He is also more of a neutral force than a villain.

The Beyonder first appeared in the episode "[[Secret Wars (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|Arrival]]" of Season 5, the first chapter of that Secret Wars in the series.  The Beyonder worked with [[Madame Web]] to prepare Spider-Man for the Secret Wars, supposedly to see whether good was more powerful than evil.  During this time, [[Doctor Doom]] actually managed to steal the Beyonder's powers in "Doom" (the third and last chapter to the Secret Wars), but he was defeated, and it was implied that he had planned the whole ordeal out before it began.  The Beyonder had all the heroes Spider-Man had summoned to assist him forget their actions, and sent them home. Spider-Man, however, was needed for something bigger, so he was the only one whose memory was untouched.  It was revealed that the evil [[Spider-Carnage]] had destroyed the entire multiverse with a giant bomb.  However, when the destruction reached the Beyonder's own reality, he used all of his powers to roll back time.  Though it tested him to the extreme, he sent his servant, Madame Web, into the past to train Spider-Men from many different realities to find out which one would be worthy enough to lead the others against Spider-Carnage.

==Other versions==
===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In the [[Earth-691]] timeline, the Beyonder provides [[Vance Astro]] of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] with a costume resembling a [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]].

===[[Mutant X]]===
In this alternate Earth, the Beyonder allies with Dracula, to wage war on Earth's forces and to confront the entity known as the 'Goblyn Queen'. This battle ends up threatening all realities.

== Parodies ==
In the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' universe, "The Bee-Yonder" briefly appears to give Spider-Ham a version of the black uniform, stating that the familiar red-and-blue uniform was out of style.

[[Mister Mxyzptlk]] parodied the Beyonder in his first appearance in current continuity by assuming a form and identity that was similar in clothing and appearance to the Beyonder. He called himself "Ben Deroy", an anagram of "Beyonder." When asked by Lois Lane where he came from, he answers by saying, "Oh...here and there. Yonder, let's say. Yes. Yonder."
