The '''Beyonder''' is a fictional comic book [[fictional character|character]] appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Jim Shooter]]<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|title=Go big or go home: Why Marvel's new 'Secret Wars' could be too much|first=Joshua|last=Rivera|date=October 10, 2014|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/10/10/go-big-or-go-home-why-marvels-new-secret-wars-could-be-too-much/}}</ref> and artist [[Mike Zeck]], the Beyonder first appeared in ''[[Secret Wars]]'' #1 (May 1984) as an unseen, apparently omnipotent being who kidnapped the heroes and villains of the [[Marvel Universe]] and had them do battle another planet called Battleworld. He later appeared in a more antagonistic role in the 1985 sequel ''[[Secret Wars II]]'', in which he took human form, and threatened to destroy the Marvel multiverse. Although he first took on a physical, humanoid form in ''Secret Wars II'' #1, it was in ''Secret Wars II'' #3 that he took on the permanent form in which he remained for the rest of his existence, that of a Caucasian human male with curly black hair. Although the character met his demise at the end of ''Secret Wars II'', he has subsequently appeared in stories well into the 2000s.

==Fictional character biography==
===''Secret Wars''===
The Beyonder is the sum total of a parallel reality called the Beyond-Realm or simply "Beyond", hence the name "Beyonder".  This dimension is accidentally accessed by lab technician Owen Reece.  Part of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues Reece with near-infinite powers, which he wields as the villainous [[Molecule Man]] - potentially one of the most powerful villains in the [[Marvel Universe]].  The remaining energy of the pocket dimension apparently gains sentience and curiosity. The Beyonder creates a planet called "Battleworld" out of pieces of various planets (one such piece being a suburb of Denver) and abducts a number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s from Earth so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil.{{issue|date=November 2014}}

===''Secret Wars II''===
Intrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars, the Beyonder comes to Earth to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand. He creates a human body for himself; originally, this body resembles Molecule Man. He also transforms a television writer named Steward Cadwell into Thundersword. Finally, the Beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of [[Captain America]].{{issue|date=November 2014}}

===''Deadpool Team-Up''===
Long after the ''Secret Wars II'' crossover had ended, a [[Deadpool]] special featured the "Secret Wars II continues in this issue" corner tag that was used during that original storyline.  In this issue, a younger, less-experienced Deadpool is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to kill the Beyonder.  The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying "to be continued in Secret Wars III."<ref>''Deadpool Team-up'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Kosmos and Maker===
The tale of the Beyonder continues several years later when it is revealed that the energy which comprises the Beyonder and the energy that gives the [[Molecule Man]] his powers needs to be combined in order to create the basis for a mentally stable, mature cosmic entity to be born. The Beyonder then merges with the Molecule Man.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #319, in a story called "Secret Wars 3"</ref>  This being, called [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]], expels the Molecule Man from its form, and returns him to Earth. Kosmos takes on a female form and is tutored by [[Kubik]], touring the universe with him.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23</ref>  When the Molecule Man's lover, [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]], leaves him, Owen Reece gets angry, extracts the Beyonder from Kosmos, and proceeds to attack him until Kubik intervenes.{{issue|date=November 2013}}

At some unknown point, Kosmos goes mad and assumes a mortal form, now calling itself the Maker. After the now amnesiac Maker destroys a [[Shi'ar]] colony, the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] manage to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the [[Kyln]]. The Maker's madness takes control of several inmates, but is finally subdued by [[Thanos]] and several of his allies among the prisoners. Thanos confronts the Maker, and, by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture, manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind. Thanos instructs the Shi'ar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead, or the Beyonder essence would go free again.<ref>''Thanos'' #10 (2003). Marvel Comics</ref>

==="Annihilation"===
In the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" crossover storyline, the former Herald of Galactus, the [[Fallen One]], now under the control of Thanos,<ref>''Thanos'' #12 (2004)</ref> is sent to investigate the aftermath of the [[Kyln]]'s destruction by the [[Annihilation Wave]] and ascertain the Beyonder's fate. The Fallen One soon finds the lifeless form of Kosmos in the rubble.<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1 (April 2006). Marvel Comics</ref>

===The Illuminati===
[[File:Beyonder.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The Beyonder in his human form. Art by [[Jim Cheung]].]]
In a [[retcon]] of past events, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] reveals to his fellow [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] members that in the original Secret War, he had attempted to mind-scan the Beyonder, revealing him as one of the [[Inhumans]] previously ruled over by fellow Illuminati member [[Black Bolt]]. Xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the Beyonder's seemingly godlike abilities, which was that the Beyonder was not only an Inhuman but also a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and the exposure of his mutant genes to [[Terrigen Mist]]s had created an unprecedented power.<ref>[http://www.popcultureshock.com/new-avengers-illuminati-3/41826/ "New Avengers: Illuminati #3 Preview"]. Pop Culture Shock. {{deadlink|date=December 2014}}</ref>
	
This revelation leads to a confrontation with the Beyonder during the events of the second Secret War, wherein Black Bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the Beyonder's activities. When encountered, the Beyonder is dwelling in a simulacrum of Manhattan Island on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[asteroid belt]].<ref>''New Avengers: The Illuminati'' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Beyonder was originally one of the absolute strongest and most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe. In the original Secret Wars storyline, he was the be-all and end-all of the "Beyond Realm"<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #8 (1985). Marvel Comics</ref> that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings. 

Narration stated that he possessed power millions of times greater than a [[Brane cosmology|multiversal]] scale,<ref name="SWII9">''Secret Wars II'' vol.1 #9 (March 1986). Marvel Comics</ref> and it was similarly claimed that a regular universe was as a drop of water in the ocean compared to the Beyond Realm.<ref name="SWII4">[http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140812053848/powerlisting/images/1/15/Stan_Lee_called_beyonder_omnipotent_.jpg ''Secret Wars II'' vol.1 #4 (Oct. 1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref>

The Beyonder proved capable of destroying, and recreating, the abstract multiversal entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself, although it extremely exerted and weakened him to do so. However, even in this state, he was capable of easily sending a horde of demons back to hell with a wave of his hand.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (1985). Marvel Comics</ref>

He also displayed certain limitations when being overloaded by [[Rachel Summers]] as host to the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], to the point that he collapsed on the ground,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #203. Marvel Comics</ref> or when exerting himself in battle against the Molecule Man,<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #9 (1985). Marvel Comics</ref> and he lost all or part of his power on various occasions.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #10 (Feb. 1985). Marvel Comics</ref><ref name="SWII4"/><ref name="SWII9"/> He also stated that the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] when in perfect harmony with the Universe was capable of killing him.<ref>''Peter Parker the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #111. Marvel Comics</ref> However, on another occasion, after fighting a superpowered biker gang, the Beyonder stated that he tried to limit his powers to keep them more in line with the world around him.<ref>[http://marvel.wikia.com/Dazzler_Vol_1_40 ''Dazzler'' Vol.1 #40 (Nov. 1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref>

After his creator, [[Jim Shooter]], left Marvel, writer-editor [[Tom DeFalco]] re-tooled the Beyonder: He was no longer omnipotent, as certain other cosmic entities were retroactively vastly upgraded to transcend the scale of infinity that the character worked on. For example, the [[Living Tribunal]] went from simply being able to detonate stars during the time of [[Secret Wars II]] into being an at least [[Projective geometry|16-dimensional]] entity transcending multiversal scale by at least 11 degrees of infinity. <ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol.2 #7 (June 1986). Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #319 (1988). Marvel Comics</ref><ref name="FF23"/><ref name="FF27"/> 

Nonetheless, The Beyonder retained his similar high infinite psionic abilities, allowing him to control and manipulate matter and energy at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]].

He repelled [[Galactus]] "like a bug",<ref name="SW1">''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> and exceeded the collected energy of the latter's World-Ship.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #10. Marvel Comics</ref> He once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first Secret Wars,<ref name="SW1"/> and later created a universe out of his own being.<ref name="FF319">''Fantastic Four'' #319. Marvel Comics</ref> When the [[Molecule Man]] extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos, their battle took place in more than 3 spatial dimensions, and threatened to cause a trans-multiversal scale of destruction.<ref name="FF27">''Fantastic Four Annual'' #27 (1994). Marvel Comics</ref> In Kosmos' 'Maker' incarnation, she was stated as capable of reversing [[Antimatter#Antiuniverse|The Crunch]] itself, essentially collapsing the entire universe.<ref>''Thanos'' #10-12. Marvel Comics</ref> The Beyonder could endow himself with a corporeal form of limitless strength and endurance. However, his scale of power was stated to be significantly below that of the [[Living Tribunal]] and [[Eternity (Marvel Comics)|Eternity]],<ref name="FF319"/> the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]],<ref name="FF23">''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23 (1990)</ref> or the Molecule Man (when unfettered from his emotional weaknesses).<ref name="FF27"/>

==Other versions==
In the Earth-691 timeline seen in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', the Beyonder provides Guardian [[Vance Astro]] with a black undergarment resembling a [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #38 (1993). Marvel Comics</ref>

In the alternate Earth of ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'', the Beyonder allies with Dracula, to wage war on Earth's forces and to confront the entity known as the '[[Madelyne Pryor#Mutant X|Goblyn Queen]]'. Many of the Mutant X heroes are killed in this confrontation. The battle ends up threatening all realities.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

The creator [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] once parodied the character by letting [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] assume a form and identity that was similar in clothing and appearance to the Beyonder in his first appearance in the post-Crisis continuity. He called himself "Ben Deroy", an anagram of the name "Beyonder." When he was asked by [[Lois Lane]] where he came from, he answers by saying, ''"Oh...here and there. Yonder, let's say. Yes. Yonder."''<ref>''Superman'' #28. [[DC Comics]].</ref>

In the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' universe, "The Bee-Yonder" briefly appears to give Spider-Ham a version of the black uniform, stating that the familiar red-and-blue uniform was out of style.<ref>''Spider-Ham'' #17. Marvel Comics</ref>

The Behinder was another satirical version of the Beyonder, that appeared in Marvel's ''[[What The--?!]]'' humor magazine. He was stated to be omnipotent by the publication.{{issue|date=December 2014}}
