==Fictional character biography==
Thirteen years ago during a demonstration on the use of radioactive rays at a science exhibit, a [[spider]] was accidentally exposed to the radiation and absorbed large amounts of it. In its dying moments, the arachnid bit the nearest living thing to it, Peter Parker. As a result, the young teenager would gain amazing powers and become [[Spider-Man]]. However, this was not the end. As mere moments after biting Parker, the spider bites another young student by the name of Cindy Moon.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #1 (April 2014)</ref> Soon after, Cindy’s abilities manifested but she was unable to control them. Some time later, [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]] would approach the Moon family to offer his help and guide Cindy in controlling her newfound abilities. After six years since getting bit and training to use her powers, Cindy is locked up inside a facility by Ezekiel to protect her and the other “spiders” from [[Morlun]] and his family called the Inheritors.<ref name="ASM4">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #4 (July 2014)</ref>

===Original Sin===
Seven years later during the "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]" storyline, Spider-Man would be exposed to the energies of the Watcher’s eye alongside his fellow heroes. As secrets began to flow into his head, Spider-Man saw that the radioactive spider that bit him managed to bite another before it died—a girl named Cindy, and learned what happened to her afterwards. Spider-Man immediately goes on to search for Cindy to break her out of the facility Ezekiel had kept her in. After unlocking the door to Cindy’s room, Cindy attacks Spider-Man in a fit of rage saying that he’s doomed them all. After a quick tussle, Spider-Man calms Cindy down by telling her that Morlun is dead and as such, is no longer a threat to them. Ecstatic about her freedom, Cindy quickly makes her way out of the facility to finally see the city of New York after hiding in her bunker for so long. Spider-Man quickly stops her as she’s about to go outside while wearing her civilian clothes, which prompts her to quickly spin an outfit made out of her webbing and tells Spider-Man to refer to her as Silk.<ref name="ASM4"/> Silk swings around the city and goes to her old home, hoping to find her family there. Her heart breaks as she finds another family living in what once was her home, with her family nowhere to be found. Realizing just how much she’s lost, she asks Spider-Man when exactly Morlun died. Spider-Man lets slip the fact that the Ancient had died twice—revealing to Silk the fact that Morlun could come back to life. Furious, Silk attacks Spider-Man once again as she realizes that her 7 years in the bunker were wasted knowing that Morlun could still kill them. During their fight, however, both Silk and Spider-Man feel the powerful connection from their Spider-Senses and end up sharing a passionate kiss. Continuing their moment of passion, both Peter and Cindy are unable to let go of each other due to the strong, primal connection they feel for each other. Peter stops as soon as Cindy begins to further remove his mask, after which they move back to Peter and Anna Maria’s apartment. Afterwards, Peter and Cindy go to the Fact Channel’s news station where they are attacked by [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. While Silk is easily able to dodge Electro’s lightning bolts thanks to her “hyper-spider-speed and senses,” Spider-Man isn’t as lucky. Black Cat then goes after the paralyzed superhero and begins to unmask him in front of live TV.<ref name="ASM5">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #5 (Aug. 2014)</ref> Thankfully, [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hogged up too much space in front of the camera, preventing the camera (and anyone else) from seeing Peter’s face. Silk quickly spins a temporary mask for Peter and escapes with him back into Peter and Anna Maria’s apartment. At the waterfront where Parker Industries will be holding the demonstration for their new device meant to cure Electro, Cindy spins Peter some Electro-insulated webbing to prevent what happened during their last fight with Electro from happening again. When the fight begins, Black Cat sabotages the machine which causes Electro to go out of control and hit a helicopter. Silk hurries and begins spinning porous webs to catch the crashing helicopter. She then creates an insulated web-pod to contain the inevitable explosion of energy coming from Electro. The entire incident ends with a depowered Electro and a missing Black Cat. Afterwards, Cindy gets accepted for a job at the Fact Channel where she intends to use the information center in order to find her family.<ref name="ASM5"/>

===Spider-Verse===
During the "[[Spider-Verse]]" storyline, Spider-Man and Silk discuss their problem in which whenever they get close, they feel the need to mate as well as possible solutions to this. They end up fighting [[Looter (comics)|Looter]] and his henchmen where they are stealing equipment and Spiderling costumes from Spider-Island II. Spider-Man and Silk managed to defeat them with the help of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and [[Spider-Man 2099]] as the final henchman is defeated by [[Spider-Girl]] of Earth-982, Spider-UK, and [[Spider-Ham]]. Silk accompanies the other spider-themed heroes through the portal to Earth-13.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #9 (Nov. 2014)</ref> When Spider-Man wants Silk to be among those to accompany him to gather the other spider-themed heroes, Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4 advises that Silk should stay behind. Silk ends up following anyway which later angers Old Man Spider-Man when they arrive on Earth-928. He mentioned that Silk shouldn't have left her bunker. After [[Daemos]] was slain, [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) blames Silk for Daemos' attack and suggests that they kill her. When Brix, Bora, and a Daemos clone arrive and kill Old Man Spider-Man Silk steals Spider-Man's portal device, intending to set right the deaths she caused and opens a portal while attracting the Inheritors' attention. Spider-Woman volunteers to follow Silk while Superior Spider-Man sends Spider-Man Noir to accompany them.<ref name="ASM10">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #10 (Nov. 2014)</ref> After Spider-Man of Earth-90214 was badly injured, Silk and Spider-Woman take him back to Earth-90214 so that he can die there. Superior Spider-Man expresses concern since the Inheritors have already been there, but Spider-Man says Silk should be safe as long as she keeps moving and takes one of Superior Spider-Man's cloaking devices.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #11 (Dec. 2014)</ref>

===''Silk'' solo series===
After arriving back in New York, Silk begins a career of crime-fighting while searching for her family after ten years, as well as continuing her job as a Fact Channel intern. Wanting to move focus on the search for them, Cindy moves out of her friend's apartment and moves back into her old bunker, which she uses as a base of operations. Discovering that her family has no official records of being around, save for some old files, she goes to her old neighborhood. Here she runs into her high school boyfriend, who is now engaged. Unbeknownst to Silk during all this, two mysterious figures are watching her whenever she is in the bunker.<ref>''Silk'' #1-2 (February and March 2015)</ref>

As seen in the first issue of the Silk comic book title, she engages in battle against a costumed villain called Dragonclaw (whose name she says sounds like a [[Pokémon]]),<ref>http://www.superheroreviews.com/comic-book-review-of-silk-1/</ref><ref>''Silk'' #1</ref> and also engages in antagonism with Black Cat.

Spider-Man thinks she is not well and asks the [[Fantastic Four]] to check her. Silk consents to the check up but becomes annoyed when she finds out Peter revealed the history about her bunker and Ezekiel to them.

She and [[Human Torch]] also go on a date of crime fighting despite Peter's protests.<ref>''Silk'' #4 (May 2015)</ref>

During the "Last Days" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Cindy Moon begins her run as Silk and comes across Dragonclaw and defeats him and references Pokémon while defeating him. Later, she finds out Dragonclaw did this because he was in the debt of Black Cat. This was the reason for his misdeeds and the tries to help him out by enlisting the help of Spider-Man to fin Black Cat's gang causing a show down between Silk and Black Cat which leads to Silk cutting her hair to escape. While this was going on, it is show that Silk is still very confused as to what has happened to her family and ex-boyfriend which leads her to take a job under J. Jonah Jameson at the Fact Channel who takes an immediate liking to her as she suggests that they start taking photos of silk. One day, J. Jonah Jameson looks at Cindy Moon's screen to find out that she was trying to leads as to where her family is which also leads her to tell him everything about her. A couple of days pass and it is show to be the final incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610 as time is running out. J. Jonah Jameson gives Silk a cade file of a young boy who seems to be Silk's brother as he tells her this. She runs straight out going to that location where she meets her brother now with a 'X' shape scar on the left side of his forehead embraces him. As the world is ending, Silk tells her brother "I'm Sorry."<ref>''Silk'' #7</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Silk is on a stakeout at a skating rink. Silk's Spider-Sense goes off as a group of Goblin Nation grunts rob a bank. Monologuing to herself, Silk reveals she'd been tailing the Goblin Nation for two weeks in order to avenge her brother who was infused with Goblin Formula and now has no memory of what happened to their parents. Extending claws, Silk slashes the Goblin Nation grunts' getaway car and webs them up, taking their loot, a safety deposit box containing Parker Industries tech. Thinking to herself that she has no idea what's in the safety deposit box just that her boss wants it, Silk returns to her now-employer Black Cat, who she is working with despite their earlier antagonism, who scolds her for showing mercy and tells her that being good is bad for business.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #1</ref>
