==In other media==
Spencer Smythe (voiced by [[Edward Mulhare]]) appears in [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]].  In the series, he is hired by [[Norman Osborn]] to create the original Spider-Slayer called the Black Widow, so that Osborn can create a hoverchair for his paralyzed son, Alistair, only if Spider-Man is captured.  At OsCorp, the robot captures the wrong person. Then, Spider-Man comes to stop it, before Osborn activates one of the seekers, making Spider-Man hitting to start a fire. When Osborn doesn't allow Alistair to get a hoverchair due from saying "no spider splat, no hoverchair", Spencer decided to stay behind OsCorp to finish Spider-Man off while Osborn puts Alistair to safety.  After the Black Widow is destroyed by Spider-Man by acid, OsCorp explodes, and Alistair thinks that he died.

Later, it is revealed that, after the explosion, Spencer can't find an exit to OsCorp. Then, [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] freezes Smythe, so his son can work for him. But Alistair figures out about after Dr. Herbert Landon, the Kingpin's replacement partner, turned Alistair into a cyborg, and having Alistair run off with his cryogenically-frozen father, desperate to work for anyone, except for the Kingpin, to revive his father, most notably the crime lord, Silvermaine, who is ironically the Kingpin's enemy.
