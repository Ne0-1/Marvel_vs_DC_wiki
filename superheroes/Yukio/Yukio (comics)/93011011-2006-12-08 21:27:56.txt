'''Yukio''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel universe]]. She is of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] origin. Yukio is a supporting character of the [[X-Men]].

==Roles and professions==

Yukio is an occasional thief by profession, as well as a [[ronin]], a masterless [[samurai]]. Yukio has been portrayed as a free spirit with an almost careless disregard for personal danger.

While she is highly skilled in the martial arts, Yukio is not a mutant and possesses no super powers. Her speciality weapons are scalpel-like [[shuriken]], of which she can hurl several at a time with deadly accuracy.

==Association with X-Men==

The X-Men's first encounter with Yukio occurred when [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] had his struggle with [[Shingen Harada]], father of Wolverine's girlfriend [[Mariko Yashida]]. At that time Yukio worked for Shingen, and one of her tasks was to kill Wolverine. Instead she developed a crush on him and subsequently aided him in bringing about Shingen's downfall. This story is recorded in the Wolverine mini-series of September, 1982.

In ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #172, Wolverine invited his team to Japan for his wedding to Mariko. [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] poisoned the X-Men during a dinner that Logan hosted for them; Viper, disguised as one of the housemaids, served them poisoned tea. Logan, tasting the poison, warned Ororo and knocked the cup from her hand before she could drink it. While the others were recuperating from the attack, Storm, Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] (who had been unaffected by the poison) and Yukio went after Viper and the Silver Samurai to stop the Samurai's plot to assassinate Mariko, who was his half-sister. Yukio posed as a decoy, disguising herself as Mariko to lead them away from her. 

During their altercation with Viper and [[Silver Samurai]], Storm blasted the Silver Samurai with her lightning, finding to her horror that her powers were out of control. Storm drew the lightning back into herself, nearly electrocuting herself in the process. Yukio knocked Storm out of the path of her lightning bolts and dove with her into the nearby bay, enabling them to escape from the Silver Samurai. (Actually, these events had been brought about and influenced by the mutant villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who was conducting a revenge campaign against the X-Men at the time. He was also responsible for the subsequent halting of Wolverine's and Mariko's wedding.)

==Impact and future appearances==

Storm, inspired by what she called Yukio's "madness" and lust for life, changed her image dramatically and adopted a new look: a mohawk haircut, studded collar, and black leather clothing.

Yukio later met up, once again, with Wolverine to help him fight the ninja master [[Ogun]] in the comic "Kitty Pryde & Wolverine." 

Yukio has a rivalry with the X-man [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. Both being thieves, they often tried to steal the same object. Yukio framed Gambit for a crime she committed in the "Wolverine and Gambit" comic. 

Yukio is also part of [[Professor X]]'s secret information network of humans and mutant known as the Mutant Underground (not to be confused with Cable's [[Underground (comics)|Underground]]).

==Yukio and Amiko==

After the death of Mariko Yashida, Wolverine sent his adopted daughter, [[Amiko Kobayashi]], to a foster family. He later discovered that her new foster parents were abusive and only interested in the money. Wolverine took Amiko away from them and asked Yukio to raise her. This unofficial adoption was under the protection of the Silver Samurai, now an ally of Wolverine. Yukio trained Amiko in the martial arts and to her own surprise she enjoyed her new role as a mother. When [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] targeted Wolverine's friends and family, he hired [[Omega Red]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] to kidnap Amiko. Yukio fought the two, but was overpowered and seriously injured. She asked Wolverine to kill her, but Wolverine refused. He saved Amiko shortly afterwards, but it is unclear if he returned her to Yukio.

Yukio reappeared in the pages of ''X-treme X-Men'' and seemed fully recovered. She teamed up with Storm again to enter the Arena, a fight club for mutants. In the end Yukio, Storm and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] took over the Arena.

During the [[Wolverine: Soultaker]] miniseries, it has been hinted upon by Wolverine that Yukio's real first name could be "Yukiko". It's a common habit that Japanese girls drop the extra "k" in their name to sound more mature. However, since Logan joked about it and the fact has since then never again been touched upon, its unclear if Yukiko is Yukio's actual real name or not.
