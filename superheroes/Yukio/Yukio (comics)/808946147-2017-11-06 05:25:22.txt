{{nihongo|'''Yukio'''|雪緒}} is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is a [[kunoichi|female ninja]] of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] origin and is a supporting character of the [[X-Men]].

[[Rila Fukushima]] portrays a mutant version of the character in the 2013 film, ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''.

==Publication history==
Yukio first appeared in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #1 (September 1982) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].

==Fictional character biography==
Yukio is an occasional thief by profession, as well as a [[rōnin]], a masterless [[samurai]]. Yukio has been portrayed as a free spirit with an almost careless disregard for personal danger. According to her own philosophy of life, living in danger is the ultimate adventure, while the peace of death is the final prize that awaits for every person who has truly lived.<ref name="Wolv-3">''Wolverine'' #3</ref>

While Yukio is highly skilled in the martial arts, her specialty weapons are scalpel-like [[shuriken]], of which she can hurl up to three at a time with deadly accuracy.<ref name="Wolv-3"></ref> It has been hinted upon by Wolverine that Yukio's real first name could be "Yukiko". However, since Logan joked about it and the fact has since then never again been touched upon, its unclear if Yukiko is Yukio's actual real name or not.<ref>''Wolverine: Soultaker'' miniseries</ref>

The X-Men's first encounter with Yukio occurred when [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] had his struggle with [[Shingen Yashida]], father of Wolverine's girlfriend [[Mariko Yashida]]. At that time Yukio worked for Shingen, and one of her tasks was to kill Wolverine. Instead she developed a crush on him and subsequently aided him in bringing about Shingen's downfall.<ref>''Wolverine'' #1-4 (1982)</ref>

Later, Wolverine invited his team to Japan for his wedding to Mariko, which Yukio joined subsequently. [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] poisoned the X-Men during a dinner that Logan hosted for them. Logan, tasting the poison, warned Ororo and knocked the cup from her hand before she could drink it. While the others were recuperating from the attack, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] (who had been largely unaffected), and Yukio went after Viper and the Silver Samurai to stop his plot to assassinate Mariko, who was his half-sister. Yukio posed as a decoy, disguising herself as Mariko to lead them away from her. During their altercation with Viper and Silver Samurai, Storm found her powers inexplicably going out of control, endangering her life. Yukio knocked Storm into the nearby bay, enabling them to escape from the Silver Samurai. (These events had actually been brought about and influenced by the mutant villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who was conducting a revenge campaign against the X-Men at the time. He was also responsible for the subsequent halting of Wolverine's and Mariko's wedding). Storm, inspired by what she called Yukio's "madness" and lust for life, changed her image dramatically and adopted a new look: a mohawk haircut, studded collar, and black leather clothing.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172-173</ref>

Yukio later met up, once again, with Wolverine to help him fight the ninja master [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]].<ref>"Kitty Pryde & Wolverine."</ref> She developed a rivalry with the X-Man [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]: Both being thieves, they often tried to steal the same object. Yukio once framed Gambit for a crime she committed.<ref>"Wolverine and Gambit"</ref> Yukio is also part of [[Professor X]]'s secret information network of humans and mutants, known as the Mutant Underground (not to be confused with Cable's [[Underground (comics)|Underground]]).

After the death of Mariko Yashida, Wolverine sent his adopted daughter, [[Amiko Kobayashi]], to a foster family. He later discovered that her new foster parents were abusive and only interested in the money. Wolverine took Amiko away from them and asked Yukio to raise her. This unofficial adoption was under the protection of the Silver Samurai, now an ally of Wolverine. Yukio trained Amiko in the martial arts and to her own surprise she enjoyed her new role as a mother. When [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] targeted Wolverine's friends and family, he hired [[Omega Red]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] to kidnap Amiko. Yukio fought the two, but was overpowered and seriously injured, and left her in a wheelchair. She asked Wolverine to kill her, but Wolverine refused and saved Amiko shortly afterwards. Yukio reappeared and was fully recovered from her previous injuries.<ref>''X-treme X-Men'' Arena storyline</ref> She teamed up with Storm again to enter the Arena, a fight club for mutants. In the end, Yukio, Storm, and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] took over the Arena.

Later, Yukio and Amiko were attacked by Hellverine (a demonic being who had taken over Wolverine's body in order to kill his loved ones) on the behest of Marduk Kurios. Her confusion over the fake Wolverine's behavior earned Yukio serious injuries, but Amiko returned from school just in time to save them both from Hellverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.4 #2</ref> When Wolverine goes back to Japan to stop a war between the Hand and the Yakuza, Yukio is shown to be once again in a wheelchair due to Hellverine's attack.<ref>''Wolveine'' vol. 4 #300</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Yukio is shown running an illegal nighclub in Osaka, Japan when it is visited by [[War Machine]] where he asks her about the tech-based ninjas. Yukio states that she can't say anything if she wants her business to stay afloat. After being threatened with the prospect of having the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] storming the place, Yukio points War Machine to a rather big and muscular man in a tuxedo who leaves the nightclub with two ladies entering the car with him.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #6</ref>

==Other versions==
===X-Men: The End===
In the ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' series, a [[Skrull]] version of Yukio exists. The Skrull masquerades as Yukio on a mission to eliminate [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and Wolverine by orders of the [[Shi'ar]]. It is killed by Storm's icing powers.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #5</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Yukio appears in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Wolverine]]'', voiced by [[Romi Park]] in the Japanese version and by [[Kate Higgins]] in the English dub. In this series instead of using throwing knives and shurikens, she uses retractable circular throwing blades. After rescuing Wolverine from some Yakuza thugs working for Mariko's father [[Shingen Yashida]], Yukio assists Wolverine in his quest to free [[Mariko Yashida]] from her engagement to Hideki Kurohagi (the current leader of Madripoor). This was part of her quest to seek revenge against Shingen Yashida for killing her parents (who formerly worked for him). She dies in battle against Shingen after confessing to killing Logan's friend Tesshin Asano.

===Film===
* [[Rila Fukushima]] played Yukio in the 2013 film, ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''. In the film, she is a mutant who possesses superior fighting skills like in her comic counterpart but can also [[precognition|foresee the deaths of people]]. She was adopted by the Yashida family as a companion for Mariko Yashida when she was a little girl. Mariko had always considered her a sister; however, her father thought Yukio was nothing more than a playmate to her. She helps Wolverine save Mariko from her insane grandfather and [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Green]]. By the end of the film, she becomes Logan's self-appointed "bodyguard."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/wolverine-cast/178330/ |title=WOLVERINE Adds Japanese Actors &#124; Collider &#124; Page 178330 |publisher=Collider |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/46309/the-wolverines-rila-fukushima-on-the-bad-ass-yukio/ |title=The Wolverine’s Rila Fukushima on the "bad-ass" Yukio &#124; SciFiNow - The World's Best Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Magazine |publisher=SciFiNow |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>

===Video games===
* Yukio appears in the video game ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]''. She is looking for the Muramasa Blade (which has been shattered). It's up to the player to find the missing pieces and return it to her.

==Reception==
In 2011, [[UGO Networks]] featured her on their list of 25 Hot Ninja Girls, commenting: "While her short, black haircut and skin-tight leather outfit make her come off as a nefarious addition to the X-Men world, Yukio has proven to be quite a helpful non-mutant to Wolverine and his friends."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=4 |title=25 Hot Ninja Girls - Hot Women Ninjas |publisher=UGO.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>
