'''Yukio''' ('''雪緒''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is a [[kunoichi|female ninja]] of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] origin and is a supporting character of the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''Wolverine'' #1 (September 1982) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]. Yukio also appears in the Wolverine [[anime]] series from the ''[[Marvel Anime]]'' line.

==Fictional character biography==
Yukio is an occasional thief by profession, as well as a [[rōnin]], a masterless [[samurai]]. Yukio has been portrayed as a free spirit with an almost careless disregard for personal danger. While she is highly skilled in the martial arts, Yukio is not a mutant and possesses no super powers. Her specialty weapons are scalpel-like [[shuriken]], of which she can hurl several at a time with deadly accuracy.

It has been hinted upon by Wolverine that Yukio's real first name could be "Yukiko". However, since Logan joked about it and the fact has since then never again been touched upon, its unclear if Yukiko is Yukio's actual real name or not.<ref>''Wolverine: Soultaker'' miniseries</ref>

The X-Men's first encounter with Yukio occurred when [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] had his struggle with [[Shingen Yashida]], father of Wolverine's girlfriend [[Mariko Yashida]]. At that time Yukio worked for Shingen, and one of her tasks was to kill Wolverine. Instead she developed a crush on him and subsequently aided him in bringing about Shingen's downfall.<ref>''Wolverine'' #1-4 (1982)</ref>

Later, Wolverine invited his team to Japan for his wedding to Mariko, which Yukio joined subsequently. [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] poisoned the X-Men during a dinner that Logan hosted for them. Logan, tasting the poison, warned Ororo and knocked the cup from her hand before she could drink it. While the others were recuperating from the attack, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] (who had been largely unaffected), and Yukio went after Viper and the Silver Samurai to stop the Samurai's plot to assassinate Mariko, who was his half-sister. Yukio posed as a decoy, disguising herself as Mariko to lead them away from her.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #172</ref> During their altercation with Viper and Silver Samurai, Storm blasted the Silver Samurai with her lightning, finding to her horror that her powers were out of control. Storm drew the lightning back into herself, nearly electrocuting herself in the process. Yukio knocked Storm out of the path of her lightning bolts and dove with her into the nearby bay, enabling them to escape from the Silver Samurai. (Actually, these events had been brought about and influenced by the mutant villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who was conducting a revenge campaign against the X-Men at the time. He was also responsible for the subsequent halting of Wolverine's and Mariko's wedding.)

Storm, inspired by what she called Yukio's "madness" and lust for life, changed her image dramatically and adopted a new look: a mohawk haircut, studded collar, and black leather clothing. Yukio later met up, once again, with Wolverine to help him fight the ninja master [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]].<ref>"Kitty Pryde & Wolverine."</ref> She has a rivalry with the X-Man [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. Both being thieves, they often tried to steal the same object. Yukio framed Gambit for a crime she committed.<ref>"Wolverine and Gambit"</ref> Yukio is also part of [[Professor X]]'s secret information network of humans and mutants, known as the Mutant Underground (not to be confused with Cable's [[Underground (comics)|Underground]]).

After the death of Mariko Yashida, Wolverine sent his adopted daughter, [[Amiko Kobayashi]], to a foster family. He later discovered that her new foster parents were abusive and only interested in the money. Wolverine took Amiko away from them and asked Yukio to raise her. This unofficial adoption was under the protection of the Silver Samurai, now an ally of Wolverine. Yukio trained Amiko in the martial arts and to her own surprise she enjoyed her new role as a mother. When [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] targeted Wolverine's friends and family, he hired [[Omega Red]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] to kidnap Amiko. Yukio fought the two, but was overpowered and seriously injured. She asked Wolverine to kill her, but Wolverine refused and saved Amiko shortly afterwards. Yukio reappeared and seemed fully recovered from her previous injuries.<ref>''X-treme X-Men'' Arena storyline</ref> She teamed up with Storm again to enter the Arena, a fight club for mutants. In the end Yukio, Storm, and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] took over the Arena.

Later, Yukio and Amiko were attacked by Hellverine (a demonic being who had taken over Wolverine's body in order to kill his loved ones) on the behest of [[Satan]]. Her confusion over the fake Wolverine's behavior earned Yukio serious injuries, but Amiko returned from school just in time to save them both from Hellverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.4 #2</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Yukio appears in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Wolverine]]'' voiced by [[Romi Park]] in the Japanese version and by [[Kate Higgins]] in the English dub. In the series, instead of using throwing knives and shurikens, she uses retractable circular throwing blades. After rescuing Wolverine from some Yakuza thugs, Yukio assists Wolverine in his quest to free [[Mariko Yashida]] from her engagement to Hideki Kurohagi (the current leader of Madripoor). This was part of her quest to seek revenge against Mariko's father Shingen for killing her parents, who formerly worked for him. She dies in battle against Shingen the final episode after confessing to killing Logan's friend Tesshin Asano.

===Film===
* [[Rila Fukushima]] is cast as Yukio for the upcoming film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''. <ref>http://collider.com/wolverine-cast/178330/</ref>

==Reception==
In 2011, [[UGO Networks]] featured her on their list of 25 Hot Ninja Girls, commenting: "While her short, black haircut and skin-tight leather outfit make her come off as a nefarious addition to the X-Men world, Yukio has proven to be quite a helpful non-mutant to Wolverine and his friends."<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/girls/hot-ninja-girls?page=4 25 Hot Ninja Girls - Hot Women Ninjas - UGO.com]</ref>
