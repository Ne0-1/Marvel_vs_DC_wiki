'''Selene''', the '''Black Queen''' of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], is a [[fictional character]], [[supervillain]]ess of [[Marvel Comics]]. Her first appearance was in ''[[New Mutants]]'' (v1) #9.

==Character biography==
Selene is a [[psychic vampire]], with vast magical and psionic powers. She is associated with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] [[inner circle]]. She is several centuries old and an enemy of the [[X-Men]].

Her long life is attributed to the fact that she is a [[psychic vampire]], able to drain the life from others to extend her own. Her name derives from the ancient [[lunar deity]] [[Selene]], daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]:[[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Theia]].

She is an [[Immortality|immortal]] of uncertain age. She has claimed to have already been old when [[Human|mankind]] was just emerging. Assuming her definition of mankind only includes Homo Sapiens, the only actually surviving species of the [[Homo (genus)|genus Homo]], this would place her birth in the early [[Upper Paleolithic]].

However ''Uncanny X-Men'' #191-192 (March - April, 1985) revealed her to have been an old enemy of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] [[Kulan Gath]]. Kulan Gath was active during the [[Hyborian Age]] and is known to have faced both [[Conan the Barbarian]] and [[Red Sonja]]. In fact Sonja reportedly managed to kill him and his spirit would not manifest again until ''Marvel Team-Up'' #79. Which would mean that Selene herself was active during the Hyborian age. She has been suggested as the oldest [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]]. The earliest other mutant known is [[Apocalypse (comics) |Apocalypse]], born in the [[30th century BC]].

Selene is assumed to have been wandering the world for millennia. She was more recently trapped
for centuries in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] in the [[Romanesque]] town of Nova Roma ([[New Rome]]).  She was worshipped as a [[goddess]] and worked to maintain the isolation of the town so she maintained in control. She was able to marry several times and have descendants. Notably including [[Magma (comics)|Amara Juliana Olivia Aquilla]]. Her most recent known husband was [[Marcus]] [[Domitius]] Gallio, a Senator.

Selene directed her worshippers to undertake tasks that eventually allowed her to leave Nova Roma.  After she left the town, the citizens regained their memories and sought to return to their previous lives.  Later stories attempted to suggest Nova Roma had been an illusion, sustained by Selene, and later the mutant known as [[Empath (comics)|Empath]].  This was ultimately disproved by [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], who discovered that the revelation of Nova Roma being an illusion was a ploy to steal her away from her home and torment those who love her. It his highly likely that Selene was the one who made Magma think Nova Roma was not real.

Of all the X-Men and their related teams, she possesses particular hatred for Magma and [[Rachel Summers]]. In particular, Rachel almost killed her once, before being stopped by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].

==Powers and abilities==
Selene has vast psionic and magical abilities. She can shape and control fire and inanimate objects, such as stone...even going as far as reducing them to dust. These powers are partially derived from magical arcane arts she has learned throughout the millenia and also in part by her innate psychic gifts. Another feature of her psionic powers is the ability to hypnotize people in her vicinity and she has limited mind control powers. Selene also has telepathic powers as evidence with her psionic battles with Professor X, and using her telepathic abilities to single out victims she can life-drained from.

Selene has enhanced physical strength; entailing that she can lift somewhere between 900 pounds and 2 tons. The amount of energy she has retained from her victims does correlate somewhat with her physical strength and resilience. She can move inhumanly fast for short bursts. This accompanied by her ability to [[hypnotize]] her enemies can allow her to "appear" to teleport, when in reality she is simply moving faster than the human eye and mind can follow while those around her are momentarily distracted. She also appears to be immune to conventional injuries: [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] once plunged a knife into her heart to no effect.

She is considered a [[psychic vampire]], entailing that she can drain the lifeforce of others to sustain her own. This has enabled her to live for thousands of years. Her victims normally die; their bodies reduced to dried gray husks. It also seems that the better the disposition of the victim, the better he or she "tastes" to Selene. By unknown means, it is also hinted that she can turn someone into a psychic vampire like herself as she tried to with the New Mutants member Psyche (later known as Mirage). Also, whenever Selene over-exerts herself when using her powers, she ages significantly. Again, by draining the life-force of another being she is rejuvenated.
