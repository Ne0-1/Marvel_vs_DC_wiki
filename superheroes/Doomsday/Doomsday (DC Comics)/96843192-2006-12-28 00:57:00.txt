'''Doomsday''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] in the {{DC Universe}}, a [[supervillain]] best known for fighting and killing [[Superman]] in the ''[[Death of Superman]]'' storyline in 1993.

==Fictional character history==
===The Ultimate===
Doomsday was artificially created in the distant past on [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], long before the humanoid Kryptonian race had gained dominance over the planet; in this time period, Krypton was a violent, hellish world where only the absolute strongest of creatures could survive (at the time, the world's dominant lifeforms were said to be the most dangerous creatures in the universe).  Doomsday's creator was a mysterious alien named [[Bertron]], who wished to create the ultimate lifeform.  To do so, Bertron and his team sent a baby onto the surface of the planet, where it would be instantly killed by the harsh environment or the vicious creatures inhabiting it.  Each time, whatever of the lifeform's remains that survived were harvested and used again, to create a better, stronger version than the previous.  In short, the mad scientist was using the method of [[cloning]] to accelerate the [[evolution]] of the being he was creating.  Through decades of this process, the being who would eventually become Doomsday was forced to endure the agony of death, thousands upon thousands of times; the memory of these countless deaths was [[Racial memory|recorded in his genes]] and drove it to hate all life.  Eventually, Doomsday gained the ability to evolve against what killed him in his prior life without the need of Bertron's technology.  At this point he proceeded to hunt down and kill all of the lethal creatures that inhabited Krypton.  Bertron himself met his death at the hands of his own creation.  Doomsday escaped Krypton and went on a killing spree across several planets, eventually coming to Calaton, where he was defeated by the energy being, [[The Radiant]].  In common Calatonian burial procedures, Doomsday's body was shackled and masked, and due to his status as a murderer, was shot into space.  Eventually, he would land on Earth, the force of the impact of his landing driving the casket deep underground.  Doomsday, however, was not dead, as any time he would be "killed", he would return evolved past whatever defeated him.

==The Death of Superman==
===Doomsday!===
In his first encounter with the [[Justice League]], Doomsday defeated the entire team of superheroes in a matter of minutes, laying waste to the entire surrounding area, and finally attracting the attention of Superman (due to his [[rudimentary]] speech, he never called himself "Doomsday.")  The name "Doomsday" was coined by [[Booster Gold]], one of the members of the Justice League, who said that the monster's rampage resembled "the arrival of [[Doomsday]]," (meaning the [[end of the world]]).  During his violent rampages, Doomsday took interest in billboards and television spots advertising violent wrestling competitions held in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], inspiring the seemingly mindless creature to head towards the city.  Superman quickly found that Doomsday's awesome power was somewhat a match for his own and he realized that if Doomsday actually reached Metropolis, the resulting battle could conceivably destroy the city and kill millions of innocent people.  Simultaneously, Doomsday developed a strong desire to murder Superman in particular; this was later explained by Doomsday sensing that Superman was Kryptonian, and, due to the agony of his continuous deaths during his creation, Doomsday regarded anything Kryptonian as an automatic threat.

====Death in Metropolis====
In the space of only a few issues of the Superman comic book series, Superman and Doomsday engaged in a titanic battle that made Superman realize that Doomsday would continue to attack relentlessly, endlessly, with no defeat or surrender in sight.  It culminated in ''Superman'' #75, where in a heroic act of self-sacrifice, Superman fought Doomsday to the bitter end, until the two combatants struck a simultaneous, fatal blow that left both of them lifeless in front of the Daily Planet building in Metropolis.

In the aftermath of Superman's apparent death, no fewer than four super-beings appeared in his wake, two of them declaring themselves to be the "real" Superman.  One of these four, a half-man/half-machine [[cyborg]] (who would later become a dangerous villain called simply "[[Hank Henshaw|The Cyborg]]") took the apparently lifeless body of Doomsday and, after strapping it to an asteroid, flung it into deep space, on a trajectory that would supposedly ensure that it would never land on any planet.  The issue closes with an image of an awakened and laughing Doomsday, still strapped to the asteroid, but otherwise in good condition.

==Round two: Hunter/Prey==
Eventually, after passing through a wormhole, Doomsday's body was found by a deep-space scavenger ship that happened to be en route to [[Apokolips]], the home of the evil [[Darkseid]].  Doomsday fully revived and, after slaughtering the crew of the salvage ship, found himself on the harsh world.  This was to be the setup for a final showdown between Doomsday and Superman (similarly resurrected, in the meantime), who had been uneasy about the possibility of Doomsday's resurrection.  With the help of his JLA contacts, Superman procured a [[Mother Box]], a thinking computer, after Darkseid's servant [[Desaad]] contacted Earth about a problem on Apokolips.  Unknown to Superman, Doomsday had faced and beaten Darkseid himself in single combat and was laying waste to Apokolips.  Unfortunately, before Superman could deal with Doomsday, Desaad opened a boom tube to Calaton -- the first world where Doomsday was successfully defeated -- and sent Doomsday through to what he believed was his defeat at the hands of The Radiant.  However, Doomsday is essentially able to adapt and overcome any opponent because of the process by which he was created (he was always stronger than he had been prior to his last death); so, although The Radiant had defeated him once, he would not be able to defeat him again.  Likewise, even though Superman had killed Doomsday once before, he would be unable to do so again.  Superman, while knowing this, was obsessed with stopping Doomsday and traveled to Calaton.  He fought Doomsday again with the help of the Mother Box, but, despite it providing him with extra weapons such as an ultrasonic gun and an energy sword, Superman met with defeat.  He was forced to use one of [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]]'s time travel devices to bring Doomsday to the one place where nothing can survive: the end of time.

==Duplicate==
During the [[Wonder Woman]] ''Lifeline'' storyline, an imperfect duplicate of Doomsday was created by an artificial intelligence based on the son of the programmer, who didn't realise that he was creating an actual monster; he thought he was simply playing a computer game. Despite the duplicate possessing all of Doomsday's raw strength, with the aid of the new [[Cassandra Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]], and the disguised [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] (Currently posing as new hero Champion in a plot against the Amazons), Wonder Woman was able to shatter the false Doomsday when he was given access to so much power that his bone spurs covered his body, leaving him unable to move and reduced to a simple statue.

==The Doomsday Wars==
Doomsday returned yet again in the miniseries ''The Doomsday Wars.''  In this series, [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] uses his technology to travel to the End of Time to retrieve Doomsday in order to combine the beast's massive power with Brainiac's formidable intellect (this was later revealed to have taken place due to the timeline's reconstruction following the events of '[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]', when the former (at that time) [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]], presently known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] broke down creation and the heroes were forced to trigger their own Big Bang to stop him; the reconstruction of time meant that Brainiac was able to change the outcome of Doomsday's defeat).  Doomsday's will proved too strong to override completely with psionics, and he reacted too quickly for any chemical process to eliminate his simple mind, so Brainiac attempted to use a human host to genetically engineer a Doomsday body without the mind while temporarily lodging in Doomsday's head. He chose to use [[Pete Ross]] and [[Lana Lang]]'s newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and being transported by Superman to the best Natal Intensive Care Unit in the country; Brainiac intercepted Superman during the attempt and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe.  In the end, Superman thwarted Brainiac's plot by driving him out of Doomsday's body via the use of a telepathy-blocking 'psi-blocker'.  He then lured Doomsday to the moon, where he placed Doomsday in a kind of stasis with four [[JLA]] teleporters; perpetually transporting between those four booths, Doomsday would never be more than 25% integrated, and thus unable to 'think' of a plan to escape.

==Our Worlds at War==
Following these events, Doomsday was released by [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Suicide Squad]] to battle [[Imperiex]], a threat that was judged to be even greater than Doomsday himself.  Once freed, Doomsday slaughtered the Squad, and then went on to battle Imperiex's numerous probes (his mind having been altered to regard them as the threat he normally perceived Superman to be), which had thus far managed to seriously injure or kill most of Earth's heroes.  Doomsday tore through numerous probes with seemingly little effort before finally confronting Imperiex himself.  Imperiex proved too much for Doomsday, who blasted him, reducing Doomsday to a skeleton. 

Just a little while later, ''Superman'' #175 commemorated the 100th issue since the death of Superman in battle with Doomsday by staging a rematch.  We learn that Doomsday's body was retrieved and his flesh regrown by Lex Luthor, who handed Doomsday over to Darkseid (who had helped in the retrieving and repairing of Doomsday) to repay Earth's war debt to Apokolips.  By this time, Doomsday had evolved intelligence and sentience.  Lex Luthor arranged for the Joker to set Doomsday loose in Washington D.C. to demonstrate that he was "in good working condition."  It also happened to be the anniversary of the day that Superman had died while stopping Doomsday.  Superman defeated Doomsday by using his newfound sentience and intelligence against him.  While Superman proceeds to take everything Doomsday throws at him and then knock him out for good, he explains how he has done so: 

<blockquote>
You're different now.  You can think for yourself.  So think about this.  Before, you were a mindless thing.  Nothing could hurt you.  You couldn't feel pain, much less understand it.  But once you have felt it -- it changes you -- forever.  And you'll begin to understand something new.  Fear.  I've lived with it all my life.  You don't want to die again, do you?  The agony of what's happened to you affects your speed -- your strength ... and that little bit of doubt -- that you cannot win today -- grows.  You understand now, don't you?  You will never hurt me again.  You will never kill me again.  Never again!
</blockquote>

Darkseid attempted to replicate Doomsday, producing an army of Doomsday "clones."  Fortunately, Darkseid was not able to duplicate perfectly the creature in all its raw power, possibly as a result of the creature's complex [[DNA]], and they were defeated by a combination of heat vision and [[Batman]]'s explosive [[batarang]]s.

When Superman travelled to Apokolips to reclaim the life of John Henry Irons, the man known as [[Steel (comics)|Steel]], Darkseid's wife [[Mortalla]] ordered his troops to release Doomsday in an attempt to help Darkseid.  Doomsday's short freedom was quickly halted by [[John Henry Irons]] in the [[Entropy Aegis]], an armor with incredible power.  Doomsday disappeared and was seen wandering the harsh lands of Apokolips.

==Sentience==
With his newfound intelligence, Doomsday managed to escape Apokolips and return to Earth.  Upon his arrival, Doomsday encountered a series of emotions previously alien to him - love, compassion and kindness.  Exploring the full abilities of these new emotions, Doomsday made his way to Metropolis once more, though not in the destructive manner he had before.  Upon his arrival in Metropolis, Doomsday found Superman at the brink of death at the hands of one of his enemies.  Using his new emotions, Doomsday shocked both Superman and his opponent, [[Gog (comics)|Gog]] by ''helping'' Superman fight against Gog's army (this, however, was not the first time that they worked together; that was in the Imperiex War when they joined to fight Imperiex.  It is however, the first time Doomsday willingly worked with Superman, as previously his mind had been manipulated by [[Manchester Black]] so that his anger at Superman was transferred to the Imperiex drones). This unfortunately was not enough to save Superman, who died at the hands of Gog and caused the future to diverge.  In this new future, Doomsday was remembered as one of Earth's greatest heroes, who continued Superman's legacy by leading an army under his name against the army of Gog.  This timeline ended when an old and weary Gog offered Doomsday the chance to return to the past and save Superman - albeit at the cost of becoming a monster again.  Back in the present, an unconscious Doomsday was transported away by a younger version of Gog to an unknown location for an unknown purpose.

==Battle of Metropolis==
{{main|Battle of Metropolis}}
During ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Doomsday was freed from captivity in a cavern near the center of the Earth by [[Doctor Psycho]] and [[Warp (comics)|Warp]].  He was then mind-controlled by Doctor Psycho and used as the "spear-carrier" of a [[Battle of Metropolis|supervillain assault on Metropolis]].  He was stopped by [[Kal-El]] and [[Kal-L]], the two Supermen, who made quick work of the villain as, for the first time, the two Superman acted as a team.

==All-Star Superman==
{{Spoiler}}
In the non-continuity book [[All-Star Superman]], [[Grant Morrison]]'s modern take on the [[Silver Age]] includes the [[Project Cadmus|D.N.A. P.R.O.J.E.C.T.]] which was resurrected by a scientist named Leo Quintum.  Under Quintum, the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. is dedicated to "the engineering of new human forms" including Bizarro worker drones, giants who can travel through space under their own power, and microscopic "nanonauts" unlocking the mysteries of the sub-atomic world.  The P.R.O.J.E.C.T.'s ultimate goal is to create a replacement Superman, in case something happens to the original.

In All-Star Superman #4, it is revealed that the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. created a formula to bestow Superman-level strength and durability on a normal person, but all of their test subjects ultimately burned out.  Marked with "Do Not Open Until Doomsday", [[Jimmy Olsen]] shoots himself with a syringe gun containing a formula and transforms into a hulking, gray skinned figure with bony protrusions - the equivalent of Doomsday.  Jimmy succeeds in stopping a black [[kryptonite]]-afflicted Superman and transforms back to normal before the formula kills him.

It's not discussed as to whether Superman fought Doomsday in this universe, or the familiar Doomsday even exists.

==Powers and abilities==
Doomsday was created and evolved through cloning an infant and having it killed over and over again by one of the most dangerous species of the universe and in one of the harshest habitats in existence, prehistoric Krypton.  As such, he returns to life every time he dies and becomes resistant or immune to what killed him before.  An example of this was how Doomsday was immune to the Radiant's energy after being killed by the Radiant the first time they fought.  Also, Doomsday was shown to be extremely resilient to energy based attacks when facing Darkseid, even going so far as to brutally attack the Lord of Apokolips who had unleashed the force of his omega beams on Doomsday at point blank range.  The amount of damage dealt to Doomsday determines the length of time it would take to fully recover.  If Doomsday was barely killed with minimal damage, his recovery could be as little as a few months; if he was extensively damaged (like when [[Imperiex]] reduced him to a skeleton), it could take even thousands of years without assistance.

Doomsday can also develop/evolve resistances to whatever injures or harms him, which was demonstrated in the ''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'' series.  His shield is among the strongest in the universe.  Superman used a sound gun to paralyze Doomsday, but Doomsday's auditory canals simply closed up making him impervious to Superman's weapon.  Waverider paralyzed Doomsday once with chronal energy, but the second attempt backlashed on Waverider.  In essence, Doomsday can become as invulnerable as he needs to be. 

Doomsday can also develop weapons/evolutions to counter an opponent such as the case when he cancelled out a being of pure energy (i.e. Radiant) by generating an aura of energy and slamming into him, extending his claws to strike while Superman was in flight and reel him in while slowly poisoning him in the aforementioned ''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'' or breathe flames against the Martian Manhunter in ''Superman'' #175.

As a result of these evolutions, Doomsday is covered by bony protrusions all through out his body that serves as added protection for what few vital organs he has (brain, eyes, heart, nervous system) and as weapons (in the form of claws, fangs, and elbow/knee spurs).

Doomsday also has a highly accelerated [[healing factor]] that allows him to heal and regenerate from most damage almost instantly.  Similar to Superman's Kryptonian DNA, Doomsday absorbs and processes solar radiation and can store it for thousands of years.  As a result of his engineering, Doomsday does not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep and his body is almost solid mass.

Doomsday possesses super strength; even more than Superman.  In the Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey mini series, he was able to break Superman's left arm even though Superman was at that time experiencing a massive energy surge which was making him stronger and pushing him closer to invulnerability.  His other abilities include extreme resistance to heat, cold, and injury allowing him to survive on the most inhospitable worlds as well as survive in the vacuum of space.  Doomsday possesses almost inexhaustible endurance and stamina.  Superman once remarked on Doomsday, "We've been fighting all day and Doomsday doesn't seem to have slowed down".  Most surprising are his reflexes and speed for his size.  In a matter of seconds, Doomsday managed to render most of the Justice League incapable of fighting.  He cannot fly, but rather travels by leaping miles at a time, similar to [[the Hulk]].  Superman took advantage of this in their first battle by trying to keep him airborne.  He also used it to his advantage when he deposited Doomsday in a lake to slow him down, whilst Superman saved a mother and her child from a burning house.

==Doomsday in other media==
===Animation===
[[Image:DoomsdayCartoon.jpg|thumb|Doomsday as depicted in the series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'']]
In the animated series ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', the [[Justice Lords]] (a tyrannical version of the Justice League from a parallel universe) fought a more intelligent version of Doomsday (voiced by [[Michael Jai White]]).  The situation was resolved by that version of Superman carefully firing his [[heat vision]] through the villain's head, effectively [[lobotomy|lobotomizing]] him.  On the sequel series [[Justice League Unlimited]], it is revealed that [[Project Cadmus]] had created this Doomsday as an imperfect clone of Superman, programmed to hate the Man of Steel.  His brain eventually regenerated, and he resumed his quest to kill Superman after killing his releaser, [[Dr. Achilles Milo]], offscreen.  As in the comics, this version of Doomsday seems to have a biology that adapts to any opponent given time, so any attack used to defeat him works only once: when he re-appeared after his laser-lobotomy, he had grown a heavy bone plate in his skull, making it impossible to lobotomize him again.  Now more powerful than ever Doomsday attacked Superman and was barely defeated and imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]].

At [[Comic-Con]] 2006, it was revealed that Doomsday would be featured in a direct-to-video animated film named ''Superman: Doomsday''.

===Video Games===
* Doomsday was also a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] in the "Death and Return of Superman" video game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]].
* A clone of Doomsday is a boss featured in the video game, [[Justice League Heroes]].
