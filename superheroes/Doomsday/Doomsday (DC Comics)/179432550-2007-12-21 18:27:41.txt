'''Doomsday''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the {{DC Universe}}, best known for fighting and killing [[Superman]] in the ''[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]'' storyline published in 1993.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Ultimate===
It should be noted that the following origin tale was not created until several years after Doomsday's first appearance.  Initially, he simply erupted from the ground on Earth without explanation, or even a name (due to having only a [[rudimentary]] grasp of speech and self-identity; see the next section, ''The Death of Superman''), and immediately started the rampage which culminated in the [[Death of Superman]]. 

The nameless being later to be called Doomsday was artificially created in the distant past on [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], long before the humanoid Kryptonian race had gained dominance over the planet.  During this time period, Krypton was a violent, hellish world where only the absolute strongest of creatures could survive (at the time, the world's dominant lifeforms were said to be the most dangerous creatures in the universe).  Doomsday's creator was a mysterious alien named Bertron, who wished to create the ultimate lifeform.  To do so, Bertron and his team sent a baby onto the surface of the planet, where it would be instantly killed by the harsh environment or the vicious creatures inhabiting it.  Each time, whatever of the lifeform's remains that survived were harvested and used again, to create a better, stronger version than the previous.  In short, the mad scientist was using the method of [[cloning]] to accelerate the [[evolution]] of the being he was creating.  Through decades of this process, the being who would eventually become Doomsday was forced to endure the agony of death, thousands upon thousands of times; the memory of these countless deaths was [[Racial memory|recorded in his genes]] and drove it to hate all life.  Eventually, Doomsday gained the ability to evolve against what killed him in his prior life without the need of Bertron's technology.  At this point he proceeded to hunt down and kill all of the lethal creatures that inhabited Krypton.  Bertron himself met his death at the hands of his own creation.  

Doomsday escaped Krypton and went on a killing spree across several planets.  He began with crashlanding on Bylan 5 (245,000 years ago), a planet where [[Darkseid]] was about to wed a princess (in order to obtain that planet's chemical deposits for [[Apokolips]]' weapons factories).  Just as Doomsday and Darkseid were to meet in combat, Darkseid was forced to flee as the battle had caused the planet's atmosphere to become toxic and therefore worthless to [[Apokolips]].  Doomsday managed to hitch a ride on an escaping shuttle.

This shuttle eventually crashed on Khundia.  The warring Khundian clans united in order to build protective armor for a warrior named Kobald.  His goal was to survive long enough to force Doomsday onto a rocket.  Once the rocket was in space, Doomsday killed Kobald and the resulting explosion sent him hurling through space.

He would next come across the path of a [[Green Lantern]] named [[Zharan Pel]].  Doomsday took his power ring and sensing the power of the [[Guardians of the Universe]], made his way to them.  Hundreds of Green Lanterns were sent to stop him and were killed.  He continued to [[Oa]] where a single Guardian sacrificed himself in battle to defeat him.  With Doomsday dead, the Guardians turned their attention to rebuilding the Corps.  

In reality, the release of massive energies by the Guardian had caused a tear in space through which an injured and unconscious Doomsday fell.  Eventually coming to Calaton, he tore that world apart for three years.  With only the capital city left, all the members of the royal family combined their life forces into a single energy being, [[Radiant (comics)|The Radiant]].  The Radiant killed Doomsday with a huge blast of energy (laying waste to over a fifth of his world in the process).  In common Calatonian burial procedures, Doomsday's body was shackled and masked, and due to his status as a murderer, was shot into space.  Eventually, he would land on Earth, the force of the impact of his landing driving the casket deep underground.  Doomsday, however, was not dead, as any time he would be "killed", he would return, having evolved past whatever defeated him.

===The Death of Superman===
{{main article|Death of Superman}}
[[Image:Doomsdaysupermanbattle.png|left|thumb|270px|Doomsday battling Superman. Art by [[Dan Jurgens]].]]
In his first encounter with the [[Justice League]], shortly after breaking free from underground, Doomsday defeated the entire team of superheroes in a matter of minutes, which in turn attracted the attention of Superman.  Notable is the fact that the creature fought the entire time with literally one hand tied behind his back, yet still was able to lay waste to all opposition and much of the surrounding area.  The only Justice Leaguer who could even defend herself against Doomsday was [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]].  Also at that time, his naming occurred when League member [[Booster Gold]] stated how the rampage resembled "the arrival of Doomsday" (meaning, the [[end of planet Earth|end of the world]]).  The comment subsequently reached the broadcast media and thereafter led to the creature's accepted name.  

During his rampage, Doomsday took interest in billboards and television spots advertising violent wrestling competitions held in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], which appealed to his bloodlust and thus enticed the otherwise mindless creature to head towards the city.  By counterattacking, Superman quickly found that his opponent's awesome power was a match for his own, and so he realized that if Doomsday actually reached Metropolis, the resulting battle could conceivably destroy the city and kill millions of innocent people.  Simultaneously, Doomsday developed a strong desire to murder Superman in particular.  That desire was later explained in the Hunter/Prey miniseries: from the agony of continually dying during his creation process, Doomsday developed in his genes the ability to sense anyone Kryptonian, plus an overriding instinct to treat any such beings as an automatic threat.  (However, it remains unexplained why Doomsday did not also react with this specific type of malice towards the Cyborg Superman, who clearly possessed Kryptonian DNA).

====Death in Metropolis====
In the space of only a few issues of the Superman comic book series, Doomsday battled Superman in a titanic struggle, leading the hero to conclude that the creature would only continue to attack relentlessly and endlessly, with no urge for surrender.  It all culminated in ''Superman'' #75, where in an act of self-sacrifice, Superman refused to give up despite taking serious wounds and running low on stamina.  The fight raged to the bitter end, where the two combatants each struck a simultaneous, fatal blow, leaving both of them lifeless in front of the Daily Planet building in Metropolis.

In the aftermath of Superman's apparent death, no fewer than four super-beings appeared in his wake, two of them declaring themselves to be the "real" Superman.  One of these four, a half-man/half-machine who greatly resembled Superman (and who would later become a dangerous villain called simply "[[Hank Henshaw|The Cyborg]]"), took custody of Doomsday's apparently lifeless body.  After strapping the creature to an asteroid with an electronic device attached (a device later revealed, in the Hunter/Prey books, to be a backup of the cyborg's essence), the Cyborg flung Doomsday into deep space, on a trajectory supposedly certain to never intersect any other planet.  The issue closed with an image of an awakened and laughing Doomsday, still strapped to the asteroid but otherwise in good condition.

===Round two: Hunter/Prey===
Eventually, after passing through a wormhole, Doomsday's asteroid was accidentally found by a deep-space scavenger ship.  Upon closer examination of the peculiar-looking drifting rock, the ship's crew retrieved the object hoping to find something of value.  The scavenger vessel happened to be on a route to [[Apokolips]], the home of the awesomely-powerful tyrant [[Darkseid]].  Doomsday was fully rested and, after slaughtering the crew of the salvage ship, found himself landing on the harsh world.  This was to be the setup for a final showdown between Doomsday and Superman (similarly resurrected, in the meantime), who had been uneasy about the possibility of Doomsday's resurrection.  With the help of his JLA contacts, Superman procured a [[Mother Box]], a thinking computer, after Darkseid's servant [[Desaad]] contacted Earth about a problem on Apokolips.  Unknown to Superman, Doomsday had faced and beaten Darkseid himself in single combat (even surviving Darkseid's fabled Omega Beams) and was laying waste to Apokolips.  Unfortunately, before Superman could deal with Doomsday, Desaad opened a boom tube to Calaton -- the first world where Doomsday was successfully defeated -- and sent Doomsday through to what he believed was his defeat at the hands of [[The Radiant]].  However, Doomsday is essentially able to adapt and overcome any opponent because of the process by which he was created (he was always stronger than he had been prior to his last death); so, although the Radiant had defeated him once, he would not be able to defeat him again.  Likewise, even though Superman had killed Doomsday once before, he would be unable to do so again.  Superman, while knowing this, was obsessed with stopping Doomsday and traveled to Calaton.  He fought Doomsday again with the help of the Mother Box, but, despite it providing him with extra weapons such as an ultrasonic gun and an energy sword, Superman met with defeat.  He was forced to use one of [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]]'s time travel devices to leave Doomsday stranded at the End of Time, where Doomsday met the one force he could not overcome: [[Heat death of the universe|entropy]].

===Duplicates===
During the [[Wonder Woman]] ''Lifeline'' storyline, an imperfect duplicate of Doomsday was created by an artificial intelligence based on the son of scientist Doctor Julian Lazarus, who was attempting to bring his son back after being responsible for the accident that killed him.  The AI based on the child had already created short-lived copies of [[Barry Allen]] and [[Sinestro]], but he simply didn't realize that he was creating an actual monster; he thought he was simply playing a computer game.  Despite the duplicate possessing all of Doomsday's raw strength, with the aid of the new [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], and the disguised [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]] (Currently posing as new hero [[Harold Champion (DC Comics)|Champion]] in a plot against the Amazons), Wonder Woman was able to shatter the false Doomsday when he was given access to so much power that his bone spurs covered his body, leaving him unable to move and reduced to a simple statue that Wonder Woman was able to shatter.

In an attempt to understand death, [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] created a temporary copy of Doomsday -- which he called "Bada-Bing-Bada-Boomsday" -- in ''Man of Steel'' #75, who subsequently killed Mxyzptlk in the fight.  However, Mxyzptlk was resurrected that same issue following a meeting with the 'Supreme Being' (who bore a great resemblance to DC Comics editor [[Mike Carlin]]), and removed the Doomsday duplicate from the fight once again.

===The Doomsday Wars===
Doomsday returned yet again in the mini-series ''The Doomsday Wars.''  In this series, Prin Vnok, an underling of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] uses his technology to travel to the End of Time to retrieve Doomsday in order to combine the beast's massive power with Brainiac's formidable intellect (this was later revealed to have taken place due to the timeline's reconstruction following the events of '[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]', when the former (at that time) [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]], presently known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] broke down creation and the heroes were forced to trigger their own Big Bang to stop him; the reconstruction of time meant that Brainiac was able to change the outcome of Doomsday's defeat).

Doomsday's will proved too strong to override completely with psionics, and he reacted too quickly for any chemical process to eliminate his simple mind, so Brainiac attempted to use a human host to genetically engineer a Doomsday body without the mind while temporarily lodging in Doomsday's head.  He chose to use [[Pete Ross]] and [[Lana Lang]]'s newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and being transported by Superman to the best Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit in the country; Brainiac intercepted Superman during the attempt and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe, correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to Superman.  In the end, Superman thwarted Brainiac's plot by driving him out of Doomsday's body via the use of a telepathy-blocking 'psi-blocker'.  He then lured Doomsday to the moon, where he placed Doomsday in a kind of stasis with four [[JLA]] teleporters; perpetually transporting between those four booths, Doomsday would never be more than 25% integrated, and thus unable to 'think' of a plan to escape.

===Our Worlds at War===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Supermanbatman10.png|thumb|270px|right|Cover to ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #10. Art by [[Jim Lee]].]] -->
Following these events, Doomsday was released by [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Suicide Squad]] to battle [[Imperiex]], a threat that was judged to be even greater than Doomsday himself.  Once freed, Doomsday slaughtered the Squad, and then went on to battle Imperiex's numerous probes (his mind having been altered to regard them as the threat he normally perceived Superman to be), which had thus far managed to seriously injure or kill most of Earth's heroes.  Doomsday tore through numerous probes with seemingly little effort, while aided by Superman — the only time the two enemies would come close to teaming up — before finally confronting Imperiex himself.  Imperiex proved too much for Doomsday; he blasted him, reducing the creature to a glowing skeleton. 

Just a little while later, ''Superman'' #175 commemorated the 100th issue since the death of Superman in battle with Doomsday by staging a re-match.  It is shown that Doomsday's skeleton was retrieved and his flesh regrown by Lex Luthor (by using Superman's Kryptonian DNA), who handed Doomsday over to Darkseid (Luthor's aide in the retrieval, repair, and improvement of Doomsday) to repay Earth's war debt to Apokolips.  By this time, Doomsday had evolved intelligence and sentience.  Luthor arranged for the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to set Doomsday loose in Washington D.C. to demonstrate that he was "in good working condition."  It also happened to be the anniversary of the day that Superman had died while stopping Doomsday.  Despite being weakened by [[kryptonite]] exposure when Luthor attempted to exploit Doomsday's Kryptonian origins, Superman's heart was restarted by [[Black Lightning]] and he reached Doomsday just as the monster was struggling with the [[Martian Manhunter]].  Learning from J'onn that Doomsday wanted to kill Luthor because he blamed Luthor for his 'death' in the Imperiex War, Superman managed to defeat the creature by using his newfound sentience and intelligence against him.  While Superman proceeds to take everything Doomsday throws at him and then knock him out for good, he explains how he has done so: 

<blockquote>
You're different now.  You can think for yourself.  So think about this.  Before, you were a mindless thing.  Nothing could hurt you.  You couldn't feel pain, much less understand it.  But once you have felt it- it changes you- forever.  And you'll begin to understand something new.  Fear.  I've lived with it all my life.  You don't want to die again, do you?  The agony of what's happened to you affects your speed- your strength ... and that little bit of doubt- that you cannot win today- grows.  You understand now, don't you?  You will never hurt me again.  You will never kill me again.  Never again!
</blockquote>

Darkseid attempted to replicate Doomsday, producing an army of Doomsday "clones."  Fortunately, Darkseid was not able to duplicate perfectly the creature in all its raw power, possibly as a result of the creature's complex [[DNA]], and they were defeated by a combination of heat vision and [[Batman]]'s explosive [[batarang]]s during an attack on Paradise Island while Darkseid kidnapped the newly-arrived [[Kara Zor-El|Supergirl]].

When Superman travelled to Apokolips to reclaim the life of John Henry Irons, the man known as [[Steel (comics)|Steel]], Darkseid's wife [[Mortalla]] ordered his troops to release Doomsday in an attempt to help Darkseid.  Doomsday's short freedom was quickly halted by [[John Henry Irons]] in the [[Entropy Aegis]], an armor with incredible power that had been built out of the remains of an Imperiex probe.  Doomsday disappeared and was seen wandering the harsh lands of Apokolips.

===Sentience===
With his newfound intelligence, Doomsday managed to escape Apokolips and return to Earth.  Upon his arrival, Doomsday encountered a series of emotions previously alien to him - love, compassion and kindness.  Exploring the full abilities of these new emotions, Doomsday made his way to Metropolis once more, though not in the destructive manner he had before.  Upon his arrival in Metropolis, Doomsday found Superman at the brink of death at the hands of one of his enemies.  Using his new emotions, Doomsday shocked both Superman and his opponent [[Gog (comics)|Gog]] by ''helping'' Superman fight against Gog's army.  This unfortunately was not enough and Gog stood triumphant over Superman.  In a new future, Doomsday was remembered as one of Earth's greatest heroes, who continued Superman's legacy by leading an army under his name against the army of Gog.  This new timeline ended when it was revealed that Superman was still alive.  Superman had been trapped for two centuries and tortured by Gog.  Superman was bound and surrounded by kryptonite, not enough to kill him but enough to prevent his escape.  Gog constantly asked Superman why he didn't save his family. Superman tells Gog that he could not trade their lives for others.  Gog began offering Superman a chance to go back in time and kill him; Superman refused.  Eventually Superman shows Gog the error of his ways.  Suddenly Doomsday bursts in and picks up Superman.  Gog offered Doomsday the chance to return to the past telling Doomsday that he can correct all of this albeit at the cost of becoming a monster again.  Back in the present, an unconscious Doomsday was transported away by a younger version of Gog to an unknown location for an unknown purpose.

===Battle of Metropolis===
{{main|Battle of Metropolis}}
During ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Doomsday was freed from captivity in a cavern near the center of the Earth by [[Doctor Psycho]] and [[Warp (comics)|Warp]].  He was then mind-controlled by Doctor Psycho and used as the "spear-carrier" of a [[Battle of Metropolis|supervillain assault on Metropolis]]. Just as he came into full view in front of [[Green Arrow]], he was stopped by [[Kal-El]] and [[Kal-L]], the two Supermen, who made quick work of the villain as, for the first time, the two Supermen acted as a team. What became of him afterwards has not been revealed as of yet.

==Powers and abilities==
Doomsday was created and evolved through cloning an infant and having it killed over and over again by one of the most dangerous species of the universe and in one of the harshest habitats in existence, prehistoric Krypton. As such, he returns to life and becomes resistant or immune to what killed him before. After the Radiant killed him the first time they fought Doomsday grew immune to the latter's energy-projection, and even managed to withstand [[Darkseid|Darkseid's]] full Omega-Effect. The amount of damage dealt to Doomsday determines the length of time it would take to fully recover. During his outwardly undamaged death at Superman's hands he only needed some months to recover, but when [[Imperiex]] reduced him to a skeleton, it could take a hundred years without assistance.

Doomsday can also develop/evolve resistance from ordinary injuries. In the ''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'' series Superman used a sound gun to greatly discomfort him, but Doomsday's auditory canals closed up, making him impervious to Superman's weapon. Waverider once paralyzed Doomsday with chronal energy, but the second attempt backlashed. In essence, Doomsday gradually turns more invulnerable if not injured beyond his ability to recover, which is so far undefined. Doomsday has also developed weapons and abilities that counters the powers of an opponent. He managed to cancel out the pure-energy Radiant by slamming into him, and greatly extend his claws and develop a poison to strike Superman in flight and reel him in (Also in ''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'') or breathe flames against the fire-sensitive [[Martian Manhunter]] (''Superman'' #175). As a result Doomsday is covered by bony protrusions that serve as added protection for his few vital organs (brain, eyes, nervous system) and as weapons (in the form of claws, fangs, and elbow/knee spurs). 

Doomsday possesses extreme physical strength that even surpasses that of Superman, at one point enabling him to effortlessly stand his ground against the entire Justice League, including Superman and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] (''The Doomsday Wars''). He was able to break Superman's left arm with limited effort, as well as outmatch and beat Darkseid unconscious in physical combat. (''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'') He is immensely resistant to heat, cold, and conventional damage, allowing him to survive on the most inhospitable worlds, or in the vacuum of space. Doomsday possesses seemingly inexhaustible stamina, and was not noticeably slowed down from fighting Superman for an entire day. His reflexes and speed are vastly beyond what's expected for his bulky size, and has been able to match Superman in this regard. He cannot fly, but rather travels by leaping miles at a time. Superman took advantage of this in their first battle by trying to keep him airborne, as the sky was his element.

Doomsday has a highly accelerated [[healing factor]] that allows him to quickly regenerate from most damage. When his side was cut by Superman's heat-vision it closed within moments. As a result of his engineering, Doomsday does not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep and his body is almost solid mass.

Doomsday is now genetically Kryptonian due to his genes having been spliced with Kal-El's, however with the exception of his flame-breath he has displayed no additional abilities. In fact he was shown weaker than previously when he was singlehandedly beaten by Superman, which should not have been possible given previous accounts.

Due to his Kryptonian DNA, he is susceptible to [[Kryptonite]]. Unlike Superman, it causes him pain but cannot kill him. This was done to render him controllable.

===Weaknesses=== 
Despite his ability to adapt to any attack, Doomsday is not invincible. In ''Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey'', Superman and Waverider sent Doomsday to the End of Time, where Waverider stated that even he could not survive, and Doomsday was shown to disintegrate and cease to exist. However, at a later point Brainiac's associate Prin Vnok traveled to the end of time and rescued Doomsday just before this moment had the chance to occur. (''The Doomsday Wars'') A blast from Imperiex reduced him to a skeleton during the ''[[Our Worlds At War]]'' storyline, but he eventually recovered. After this death, Doomsday's body was recovered in a joint venture between Lex Luthor and Darkseid, and was spliced with Kal-El's DNA. Giving him greatly improved intelligence, being able to communicate and analyze in regular manner, and displaying a form of flame-breath. The drawback being that he no longer was free of fear, due to coming so close to truly dying, with almost nothing left to regenerate from, and displayed no signs of his former evolving ability, enabling Superman to defeat him for the first time. Doomsday's durability has been great enough to withstand the full force from Darkseid's Omega Beams, but he can nonetheless be injured. Superman has, in order of occurrence, been able to snap one of his knee protrusions, temporarily kill him with a blow to the head, cut through his body with his heat vision, and knock him out. However he previously (as of the Hunter/Prey series) grew more invulnerable for every attack, although this trait has not been shown after being killed by Imperiex.

==Other versions==

*In the non-continuity book [[All-Star Superman]], [[Grant Morrison]]'s modern take on the [[Silver Age]] includes the [[Project Cadmus|D.N.A. P.R.O.J.E.C.T.]] which was resurrected by a scientist named Leo Quintum.  Under Quintum, the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. is dedicated to "the engineering of new human forms" including Bizarro worker drones, giants who can travel through space under their own power, and microscopic "nanonauts" unlocking the mysteries of the sub-atomic world.  The P.R.O.J.E.C.T.'s ultimate goal is to create a replacement Superman, in case something happens to the original.  In All-Star Superman #4, it is revealed that the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. created a formula to bestow Superman-level strength and durability on a normal person, but all of their test subjects ultimately burned out.  Marked with "Do Not Open Until Doomsday", [[Jimmy Olsen]] shoots himself with a syringe gun containing a formula and transforms into a hulking, gray skinned figure with bony protrusions - the equivalent of Doomsday.  Jimmy succeeds in stopping a black [[kryptonite]]-afflicted Superman and transforms back to normal before the formula kills him.  It's not discussed as to whether Superman fought Doomsday in this universe, or if the familiar Doomsday even exists.

*In the [[Young Justice]] crossover story "World Without Young Justice", the past of all of the team members are changed. [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] is now one of two clone attempts after Superman's death. His nemesis is a teenage version of Doomsday known as [[Doomsboy]].

*In ''[[Action Comics]]'' #856, a [[Bizarro]] Doomsday is featured.

*In ''[[Superman: The Dark Side]]'' Darkseid's son Kalibak had a very similar appearance to Doomsday.

==Other media==
===Television===
[[Image:DoomsdayCartoon.jpg|thumb|200px|Doomsday as depicted in the series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'']]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Titanic Battle.JPG|thumb|200px|Doomsday appears in the animated ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'']] -->
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Deathandreturnofsuperman3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Superman versus Doomsday in '''The Death and Return of Superman'''.]] -->
In the animated series ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', the [[Justice Lords]] (a tyrannical version of the Justice League from a parallel universe) fought an intelligent version of Doomsday.  Unable to defeat Doomsday in combat, the alternate-universe "no holds barred" Superman used his [[heat vision]] to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] the villain.

On the sequel series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Doomsday's brain has regenerated, and a recently demoted and vindictive [[Professor Milo|Dr. Achilles Milo]] attempts to convince Doomsday by revealing to him his true origins: that [[Project Cadmus]] created him as an imperfect clone of Superman (like [[Bizarro]]), genetically engineered him to be even more powerful than Superman (although like his comics counterpart he possesses almost none of the super abilities that most Kryptonians have apart from great strength and durability), and inculcated within him his hatred of the Man of Steel (by constantly showing Superman's image to Doomsday at the same time that he was forced to undergo extreme pain).  Milo then releases Doomsday to take revenge on Cadmus, but instead, Doomsday kills Milo and then goes looking for Superman.  As in the comics, this version of Doomsday can adapt to any opponent, and cannot be defeated the same way twice, as he informs Superman who desperately attempts to lobotomize him as his Justice Lord counterpart had previously done.  Doomsday has, however, grown a heavy bone plate in his skull, making it impossible. Superman was barely able to defeat Doomsday during their conflict, and only managed to throw him into an active volcano to immobilize him.  Doomsday was then sentenced, without trial, to life imprisonment in the [[Phantom Zone]] by the Justice League.  Doomsday was voiced by [[Michael Jai White]].
Unlike his comic counterpart, this Doomsday does not seem to have an insane hatred of all life; only towards Superman is his rage a blinding one, causing him to disregard any evidence presented to him that shows Superman not being his tormentor. 

In one episode of ''Legion of Super Heroes'', a character very much resembling Doomsday is seen in the Phantom Zone.

In ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' the character of Phantom Zone criminal Titan may be loosely based upon Doomsday, as he is shown to be obsessed with combat, has monumental super-strength, bony protrusions coming out of his body, seems to instinctively know Clark Kent is of Kryptonian origin, and even wears green-colored clothes similar to Doomsday.  Coincidentally, [[Glen Jacobs|Glen "Kane" Jacobs]], who portrays Titan, even went by the name Doomsday at one point in his wrestling career.

===Film===
Doomsday appears in the direct-to-video ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'' animated film that was released on [[September 18]], [[2007]]. His origin is simplified, with Kryptonian records reporting him as an improperly programmed [[biomechanical]] [[supersoldier]], unable to distinguish friend from foe, imprisoned by his non-human creators and left on Earth some point in the past; the miners who find him describe the strata as "before Christ", but they're obviously stories underground, which would place his entombment in prehistoric times. He and Superman clash in a brutal battle over Metropolis, ending with Superman catapulting him into the depths of space, and propelling him back down to Earth in a blazing fireball caused by reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. The resulting explosion creates a devastating shockwave, and a vast crater in the heart of Metropolis. Doomsday's body lies motionless, his jaw twisted and askew, and his ferociously scarlet eyes fading to black, signifying both his defeat and death. No more is seen of Doomsday after this, so it's unknown if he is salvaged or if he returns.

===Videogames===
Doomsday was also a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] in the ''Death and Return of Superman'' video game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]].

A clone of Doomsday is a boss featured in the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Charles Gideon Davis]].
