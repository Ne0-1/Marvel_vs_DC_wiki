'''Ultra Boy''' is a [[fictional character]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the thirtieth century of the [[DC Universe]]. He is Jo Nah of the planet Rimbor. He has the powers of ultra-strength, flight, penetra-vision (similar to [[Superboy]]'s X-ray vision, except penetra-vision can see through lead), flash vision (his version of heat vision), invulnerability, and ultra-speed. This last power does not include the ability to break the "time barrier" as those with super-speed can. However, he can only use one power at a time. With his Legion flight ring or earlier flight belt, though, he can use another power while flying. 

He gained these powers when the space-speedster he was flying was swallowed by an ultra-energy beast (a "space whale"), exposing him to radiation while inside. His real name is derived from the story of the Biblical [[Jonah]] who was the original literary character to survive being swallowed by a whale. 

His costume features an emblem standing for this beast on his chest. It has no cape, yet originally was the busiest of all the Legionnaires' costumes, with a red top, striped cuffs, tan weight belt with three slots, dark shorts, green leggings, and red-topped boots with a crenelated fringe. 

Ultra Boy first appeared in Superboy #98 (1962), in which he was sent back in time to [[Superboy]]'s home town of [[Smallville]] to prove himself worthy of joining the Legion by learning Superboy's secret identity. He was romantically linked for many years with fellow Legionnaire [[Phantom Girl]]. The names of his parents are Crav and Mytra Nah. His girlfriend on Rimbor before he joined the Legion was [[An Ryd]]. She was later murdered and [[Brainiac 5]] was framed for the crime. An early extension of his backstory made him the equivalent of a "hot-rodder," that is, of lower social class than many of the other Legionnaires. 

In post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity he was also linked with Phantom Girl's counterpart in that reality, [[Apparition (comics)|Apparition]]. They eventually married and had a son together named Cub just before the Legion's reality was rebooted for the third time.
