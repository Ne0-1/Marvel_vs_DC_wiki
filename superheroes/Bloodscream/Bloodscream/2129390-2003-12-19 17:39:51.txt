'''Bloodscream''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and was once an enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. The character's first appearance was in ''Wolverine'' #4 ([[1989]]).

Bloodscream was a [[vampire]] who worked in [[Madripoor]] as a criminal enforcer with his partner, [[Roughhouse]]. He often came into conflict with Wolverine's alter-ego, Patch. 

As a vampire, Bloodscream had physical abilities enhanced slightly beyond the realm attainable by humans and could shape-shift. He was apparently an unusually resilient vampire.  Unlike most vampires Bloodscream could apparently only be killed by metal forged from another planet other than [[Earth]]. 

Unlike his partner, Roughhouse, Bloodscream persisted in bothering Wolverine long after Wolverine abondoned the Patch alter-ego and left Madripoor.  Eventually Wolverine tired of this harassment and lopped his head off with a mystical sword that was forged from an other-worldly metal.
