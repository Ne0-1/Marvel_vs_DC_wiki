'''Bloodscream''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and an enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. The character's first appearance was in ''Wolverine'' (volume 2) #4 ([[1989]]).

==History==

Bloodscream is a [[vampire]] who worked in [[Madripoor]] as a criminal enforcer with his partner, [[Roughhouse]]. He often came into conflict with Wolverine (who was at the time in his alter-ego as "Patch").  After Roughhouse retired, Bloodscream partnered with Cylla of the [[Reavers]].  He killed her for sustenance, then tracked down Wolverine, who hacked him nearly in half with the Clan Yashida Honor Sword, which was, according to legend, forged from a meteorite by a god.  However, Bloodscream later reappeared, apparently having turned over a new leaf; this reform was short-lived, though, and Bloodscream reverted to villainy, eventually teaming again with Roughhouse.

==Powers==

As a vampire, Bloodscream had physical abilities enhanced beyond the realm attainable by humans.  As he was created by a specifc [[voodoo]] [[curse]], his abilities differed somewhat from typical vampires.  He could drain blood from skin-to-skin contact, often leaving a hand-shaped welt on the victims where he had touched them, although this ability was apparently ineffective against mutants.  On one occasion he drained blood from another without actually touching the victim.  He could extend his lower jaw by well over two feet in length and extend his teeth into foot-long fangs in the process.  He was weakened by sunlight but did not suffer greatly under its effects.  He showed no ill effects from exposure to holy icons, such as the [[Star of David]].  Bloodscream could only be killed by metal not of [[Earth]]ly origin.  The curse that created him could only be undone (either to restore his humaity or let him die) if he made a potion that contained the heart's blood of an immortal; Bloodscream assumed that Wolverine's blood would be suitable for such a potion.
