'''Bloodscream''' ('''Zachariah Ravenscraft''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and an enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. The character's first appearance was in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #4 (February, 1989).

==Fictional character biography==
Bloodscream is a [[Pseudo-Vampire]], a creature with vampiric powers but not an actual [[vampire]]. He was born in the [[Kingdom of England]] during the 16th century. He was a typical [[sailor]] of the [[Tudor period]]. He served under [[Francis Drake]] from 1577 till 1580.

However this sailor was mortally wounded in combat and taken for treatment by a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Shamanism|shaman]]. The shaman was secretly a [[Necromancy|necromancer]] and offered him life for a chance to experiment on him. The Englishman was desperate and agreed, only to awake as a creature living on the lifeforces of others.

Despite his vast powers, Bloodscream longs for his humanity to be returned to him.  He killed the shaman who initially transformed him, after making him reveal a cure to his condition.  It seems his version of vampirism can be cured by the blood of an [[Immortality|immortal]]. 

His activities for the following four centuries are unknown. He resurfaced in the 20th century as a [[soldier]] of [[Wehrmacht]], the armed forces of [[Nazi Germany]] from 1935 to 1945. He served during [[World War II]] and first encountered Wolverine during the [[Battle of Normandy]] ([[June 6]] - [[August 25]], [[1944]]). Wolverine was serving as a [[corporal]] of the [[Canadian Forces]].

Bloodscream met Wolverine decades later in [[Madripoor]]. The Canadian seemed to have not aged a bit. He surmised that Wolverine himself must be immortal, and therefore a candidate for curing his pseudo-vampirism.  This is why Bloodscream repeatedly hounds Wolverine.

He properly introduced himself to Wolverine while working in [[Madripoor]] as a criminal enforcer with his partner, [[Roughhouse]]. He often came into conflict with Wolverine (who was at the time in his alter-ego as "Patch").  After Roughhouse retired, Bloodscream partnered with [[Cylla Markham]] of the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]].  He killed her for sustenance, then tracked down Wolverine, who hacked him nearly in half with the Clan Yashida Honor Sword, which was, according to legend, forged from a [[meteorite]] by a [[Deity|god]].  However, Bloodscream later reappeared, apparently having turned over a new leaf; he worked with [[Albert (comics)|Albert]] and [[Elsie-Dee]] for a while. This reform was short-lived, though, and Bloodscream reverted to [[villain]]y, eventually teaming again with Roughhouse.

When Bloodscream first appeared in Madripoor, he was using the name Bloodsport.

==Powers and abilities==
Bloodscream possesses a variety of superhuman abilities that are reminiscent of those possessed by supernatural vampires, even though he himself is not a true vampire. He possesses none of the supernatural or mystical vulnerabilities common to true vampires in the Marvel Universe. He hasn't been inconvienienced by sunlight, silver or any other traditional weakness from folklore. He also isn't capable of conjuring a tempest like a traditional vampire.

Like true vampires, however, Bloodscream possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reaction time. The full limits of Bloodscream's physical capabilities aren't known. 

Bloodscream must regularly feed from the blood or the lifeforce of other human beings in order to maintain his physical vitality. There are times in which he merely ingests blood and there are others when he drains an individual of his or her life energy. He is able to accomplish either by touching  a victim's bare skin. If a victim survives, the victim is left with a red scar in the shape of Bloodscream's hand at the exact point where he touches a victim. It also can result, if Bloodscream chooses to absorb a victim's entire lifeforce, in the victim's body quickly withering into rapidly aged husk. Bloodscream is able to transform a dead victim into a mindless, zombie-like being that is forced to do his bidding. 

Bloodscream is functionally immortal in the sense that he is immune to the effects of aging and to all known diseases. He has also shown the ability to rapidly heal from physical injury and to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissues, similar to Wolverine's mutant healing factor. Bloodscream has, in the past, reattached his own head after being decapitated by Wolverine. Bloodscream himself has stated that he cannot be slain by any weapon created by a mortal being, though it is unclear if this is true or not.

Bloodscream also possesses limited shape-shifting into a monsterous visage.  While in this form, Bloodscream possesses rows of bone spines down his back and a sleek tail that can impale as well as constrict. His mouth is filled with rows of razor sharp teeth as well. Bloodscream's fingers also become tipped with razor sharp claws tipped with toxins capable of affecting Wolverine to some degree, despite his healing factor. In this state, Bloodscream is little more than a ferocious animal and his craving for blood reaches frenzied levels.  

===Special skills===
Bloodscream is a good hand to hand combatant and has many connections throughout the criminal underworld, adding to his reputation as a mercenary for hire. His extended life-span has granted him great experience in matters of naval warfare and piracy. Bloodscream has achieved at least some understanding of [[necromancy]] during his lifetime. He demonstrated his knowledge in this by raising the 'Flying Dutchman' and its crew to distract the X-Men in an issue of Wolverine.
