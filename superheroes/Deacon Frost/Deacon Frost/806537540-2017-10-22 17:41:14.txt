==Fictional character biography==
Deacon Frost was allegedly a scientist looking for the key to immortality. For one of his experiments, he kidnapped a young woman in order to inject her with the blood of a recently killed [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]. The girl's fiancé broke into the lab, and in the resulting scuffle Frost was accidentally injected with the blood himself. The result was that Frost became a vampire but due to the unusual method of his becoming a vampire, he was endowed with a unique characteristic. Anyone he turned into a vampire would generate a [[doppelgänger]]. He could create an infinite number of doppelgängers by biting each doppelgänger, and they would all be under his mental control. Frost intended to use this ability to contend for the position of Lord of Vampires, a position that was presently held by [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].

Frost is the vampire responsible for the death of [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'s mother; Blade's initial mission is to exact revenge against his mother's killer. It was also Frost who turned [[Hannibal King]] into a vampire. Blade and King, while initially distrusting each other, eventually teamed up to fight Frost's army of Blade and King doppelgangers. The two of them managed to defeat and apparently destroy Frost in his underground hideout, stabbing him twice and leaving his body to be consumed as his hideout exploded.

Many years later, Blade encountered a vampire that called itself Deacon Frost. This vampire had a different appearance and personality to the original, and was later identified as being a doppelgänger. The doppelgänger attempted to summon a powerful demon, only to be devoured by it. In a later one-shot story set in [[New Orleans]], Frost was encountered yet again, but he appeared as he did in ''The Tomb of Dracula''. He also confirmed that the previous encounter was indeed an imposter, as Blade suspected, who was created using science and magic. Blade and King, with the help of [[Brother Voodoo]], foiled Frost's attempt to gain control of Garwood Industries through Donna Garth (daughter of [[Simon Garth]], the Living [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]]). Frost escaped this encounter vowing revenge. More recently, Frost appeared at the summons of Dracula to defend the Lord of Vampires as he underwent a magical ritual, only to be staked by Blade.

Frost is known as the four-fanged vampire and famed as powerful even for vampire standards, with his organization greatly spreading in Asia, this putting him in conflict with the pure-blood vampires who have reigned Europe from many years. While responsible for many tragedies surrounding Blade and others, Frost suffered his own tragic event while human. Having witnessed his son Edgar killed by a vampire, further infuriated by corrupt police that were not looking into the case, Frost decided to research vampires with help of many vampire hunters he hired prior to eventually turning into a vampire himself. Thus ultimately motivates Frost's goal to wipe out the old vampire race and rule the world with a race of new genetically altered vampires he created from Blade's DNA. Deacon Frost has done experiments on the [[Mandurugo]], the [[Manananggal]], and the [[Sundel bolong]]. By the end of the series, Deacon Frost uses Blade's DNA to assume a stronger form and is slain after a fierce fight with Blade.

===Film===
[[Image:Sd lamagra.gif|thumb|right|230px|[[Stephen Dorff]] as Deacon Frost/La Magra in the 1998 film ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]''.]]
* Deacon Frost appeared as the main antagonist of the 1998 film ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', portrayed by [[Stephen Dorff]]. Although the movie retains the character's upstart ambitions, he was a younger and more updated version for the 1990s. Deacon Frost's main objective was to become La Magra, the vampire Blood god, and rid the world of humans, believing it belongs to the vampire race. After killing the House of Erebus leaders as part of the ritual, Blade and Karen Jenson spoiled Frost's plans. Despite their efforts however, Frost managed to complete the ritual and become one with La Magra, and engaged Blade in a sword battle. During the fight, Blade managed to gain the upper hand, cutting off Frost's right arm and then proceeded to cut him in half, only for Frost's top half to re-connect and regrow his right arm. Finally, after a stand-off, Frost was killed by Blade's use of [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] darts, which caused him to explode.
* Deacon Frost was mentioned in ''[[Blade II]]'' as not being well liked in the vampire community. Vampire warlord Eli Damaskinos and lawyer/"familiar" Karl Kounen said that Blade "actually did [them] a favor" by killing Frost.
* Stephen Dorff told Wordpass.com in 2009 that there was a Deacon Frost prequel trilogy in development and that [[Stephen Norrington]] would be involved in the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dietrichthrall.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/blade-spinoff-in-development-will-feature-stephen-dorff-reprising-deacon-frost-role/ |title=‘BLADE’ Spinoff In Development: Will Feature STEPHEN DORFF Reprising DEACON FROST Role |publisher=Dietrichthrall.wordpress.com |date=2009-07-08 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> However, in 2012 the rights for Blade returned to [[Marvel Studios]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Borys |last=Kit |title=Fox's Daredevil Rights on Verge of Reverting to Marvel as Ticking Clock Looms (Video) |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/daredevil-marvel-fox-comic-adaptation-sequel-361982 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69we1jNvv?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/daredevil-marvel-fox-comic-adaptation-sequel-361982 |archivedate=August 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>
