'''Deacon Frost''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the Marvel Universe. He appears in [[Tomb of Dracula]] and in the [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] limited series.

Frost was allegedly a scientist looking for the key to immortality. For one of his experiments, he kidnapped a young woman so that he may inject her with the blood of a recently killed [[vampire]]. The girl's fiance broke into the lab and in the resulting scuffle, Frost accidentally was injected with the blood himself. The result was that Frost became a vampire but due to the unusual method of his becoming a vampire, he was endowed with a unique characteristic. Anyone he turned into a vampire would generate a doppleganger. He could create an infinite number of dopplegangers by biting each doppleganger and they would all be under his mental control. Frost intended to use this ability to contend for the position of Lord of Vampires, a position that was presently owned by [[Dracula]].
Deacon Frost is the vampire responsible for the death of Blade's mother and Blade's initial mission is to exact revenge. It is also Frost who turned [[Hannibal King]] into a vampire. Blade and King, while initially distrusting each other eventually team up to fight Frost's army of Blade and King dopplegangers and destroy Frost in his underground hideout.

Many years later, Blade encounters a vampire that calls itself Deacon Frost. This vampire had a different appearance and personality to the original Frost and may have either been an impostor or doppleganger. In a later one-shot story set in New Orleans, Deacon Frost is encountered yet again, but he appears as he did in Tomb of Dracula. He also confirmed that the previous encounter was indeed an impostor as Blade suspected. Blade and King with the help of Brother Voodoo foil Frost's attempt to gain control of Garwood Industries through Donna Garth (daughter of Simon Garth, the so-called Living Zombie). Frost escaped this encounter vowing revenge.

In the comics, Deacon Frost was depicted as a tall white haired late middle age gentleman with red eyes and possibly being from circa 1860s Germany as judged by his period clothing. The inexplicable impostor of him sported an accent and attire that suggested a [[Southern]] preacher.
