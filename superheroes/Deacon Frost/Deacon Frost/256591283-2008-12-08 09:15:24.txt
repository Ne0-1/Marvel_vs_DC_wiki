== Publication history ==
Deacon Frost first appeared in ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' #13 (October 1973), and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Gene Colan]].

The character subsequently appears in ''The Tomb of Dracula'' #25 (October 1974), #33-34 (June-July 1975), #42 (March 1976), #44-51 (May-December 1976), #53 (February 1977), ''Blade: Vampire Hunter'' #6-8 (December 1994-February 1995), ''Blade: Crescent City Blues'' (March 1998), ''Blade: Sins of the Father'' (October 1998), ''Blade: Vampire Hunter'' #1/2 (1999), #3-4 (February-March 2000), #6 (May 2000), ''The Tomb of Dracula'' #4 (March 2005), and ''Blade'' #1 (November 2006).

==Fictional character biography==
Frost was allegedly a scientist looking for the key to immortality. For one of his experiments, he kidnapped a young woman in order to inject her with the blood of a recently killed [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]. The girl's fiancé broke into the lab, and in the resulting scuffle Frost was accidentally injected with the blood himself. The result was that Frost became a vampire but due to the unusual method of his becoming a vampire, he was endowed with a unique characteristic. Anyone he turned into a vampire would generate a [[doppelgänger]]. He could create an infinite number of doppelgängers by biting each doppelgänger, and they would all be under his mental control. Frost intended to use this ability to contend for the position of Lord of Vampires, a position that was presently owned by [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].

Deacon Frost is the vampire responsible for the death of [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'s mother; Blade's initial mission is to exact revenge against his mother's killer. It was also Frost who turned [[Hannibal King]] into a vampire. Blade and King, while initially distrusting each other, eventually teamed up to fight Frost's army of Blade and King dopplegangers. The two of them managed to defeat and apparently destroy Frost in his underground hideout, stabbing him twice and leaving his body to be consumed as his hideout exploded. 

Many years later, Blade encountered a vampire that called itself Deacon Frost. This vampire had a different appearance and personality to the original Frost, and was later identified as being a [[doppelgänger]]. The doppelgänger attempted to summon a powerful demon, only to be devoured by it. In a later one-shot story set in [[New Orleans]], Deacon Frost was encountered yet again, but he appeared as he did in ''The Tomb of Dracula''. He also confirmed that the previous encounter was indeed an imposter, as Blade suspected, who was created using science and magic. Blade and King, with the help of [[Brother Voodoo]], foiled Frost's attempt to gain control of Garwood Industries through Donna Garth (daughter of [[Simon Garth]], the so-called Living [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]]). Frost escaped this encounter vowing revenge. More recently, Frost appeared at the summons of Dracula to defend the Lord of Vampires as he underwent a magical ritual, only to be staked by Blade.

In the comics, Deacon Frost was depicted as a tall white haired late middle age gentleman with red eyes and possibly being from circa 1860s Germany as judged by his period clothing. His doppelgänger sported an accent and attire that suggested a [[Southern United States|Southern]] preacher.

{{mainarticle|Blade (film)}}

Deacon Frost appeared in the 1998 [[Film|movie]] ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', starring [[Wesley Snipes]] as the title character. Although the movie retains Frost's upstart ambitions, he was a great deal younger and more updated for the 1990s. He was played by actor [[Stephen Dorff]].

In the film, Frost's main objective was to become La Magra, the vampire Blood god, and rid the world of humans, believing it belongs to the vampire race. After killing the [[House of Erebus]] leaders as part of the ritual, Blade, with the help of '''Karen Jenson''' (played by [[N'Bushe Wright]]), spoiled Frost's plans. Despite their efforts, however, Frost managed to complete the ritual and become one with La Magra, and engaged Blade in a sword battle. During the fight, Blade managed to gain the upper hand, cutting off Frost's right arm and then proceeded to cut him in half, only for Frost's top half to re-connect and regrow his right arm. Finally, after a stand-off, Frost was destroyed by Blade's use of [[EDTA]] darts (which he had believed to be Blade's serum). 

Frost was not well-liked in the vampire community; [[Eli Damaskinos]], in ''[[Blade II]]'', thanked Blade for killing Deacon Frost, and it was said that Blade "actually did [them] a favor."
