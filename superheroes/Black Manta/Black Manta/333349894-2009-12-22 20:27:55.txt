==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
His first origin was given in #6 of the 1993 ''Aquaman'' series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta grew up in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], and loved to play by the sea. As a youth he was kidnapped and sexually abused on a ship for an unspecified amount of time. At one point he apparently saw [[Aquaman]] with his [[dolphin]] friends and tried to signal him for help but was not seen. Finally, he was forced to defend himself, killing one of his tormentors on the ship with a knife. Hating the emotionless sea (and Aquaman, whom he saw as its representative), the boy was determined to become its master.<ref name="aquaman6">''Aquaman vol. 4, #6'', 1993, DC Comics, writer  Shaun McLaughlin</ref>

A second origin was given in #8 of the 2003 ''Aquaman'' series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta was an orphan who has [[autism]] and was placed in [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]]. He felt comfortable in freezing cold water, while cotton sheets were excruciatingly painful. Because the attendants at Arkham didn't know how to deal with autism, they would end up restraining him to the bed as he struggled and screamed whenever they tried putting him there.  The boy was also fascinated when he saw Aquaman on television.

The boy would end up being subjected to experimental treatments. One treatment seemed to clear the boy's head, but left him violent as a result; he killed the scientist who had administered the treatment and escaped from Arkham.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name="aquaman8">''Aquaman vol. 6, #8'', 2003, DC Comics, writer Rick Veitch</ref>

===Nemesis===

As an adult, the man who would become Black Manta designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with bug-eyed helmet that was able to shoot blasting rays from its eyes) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by [[manta ray]]s. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a force to be reckoned with, engaging in at least one unrecorded clash with Aquaman prior to his first appearance as a rival to the [[Ocean Master]] (and before joining the short-lived [[Injustice League]] in the [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] ''Silver Age'' third week event).

The fearsome Black Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years. During one of these clashes,<ref name="Adventure Comics #452, 1977">''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #452, 1977 </ref> it was revealed that Black Manta was actually an African American, whose stated objective at one point was for black people to be dominant in the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land (though this goal was revealed to be a ruse he used to trick [[Cal Durham]] into following him, and this objective was not at all evident in either his earlier or later appearances). During most of his appearances, his main goals were defeating Aquaman and gaining power for himself through the conquest of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. Finally, Manta kills Arthur Curry, Jr., Aquaman's son, which left Aquaman obsessed with revenge.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name="Adventure Comics #452, 1977"/>

Black Manta was later transformed into a Manta/Man hybrid. After a while he went back to wearing his original outfit, which covered his new appearance. At one point he took to drug smuggling from his new base in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], where he was opposed by a returning [[Green Arrow]] and Aquaman.

In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the [[Lady of the Lake]]'s Healing Hand, reverses the alterations to Black Manta, and rewired Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life. Unfortunately, Manta remained a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process.

In later events, Black Manta was used as a test subject to make water breathers, using genetic manipulation. This succeeded and since then Black Manta has returned to the oceans to face Aquaman once again.

After Black Manta caused a disturbance in [[Sub Diego]] in which Captain Marley was severely injured (''Aquaman v4'' #39). Aquaman summoned various predatory sea-life to attack Black Manta and left him for dead. It was later revealed that he was able to survive by generating an electric charge with his suit.

One year later, he took over Sub Diego but was forced to flee when [[King Shark]] bit off his face (''Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #52-53).

He can be seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

==Powers and abilities==
Black Manta's suit is specifically designed to [[adaptation|adapt]] him to an oceanic environment. It allows him complete resistance to the cold and pressure of deep sea conditions and thus grants him a level of [[superhuman]] durability, and strength (allowing Black Manta to lift/strike with the force of 5 [[ton]]s), the ability to breathe normally underwater (whether this is due to a hidden oxygen supply or its ability to extract oxygen from the water like the [[gill]]s of a fish is unknown), jet boots which function in or out of water, a [[telepathy|telepathic]] scrambler (used to temporarily strip [[Aquaman]] of his aquatic telepathy), and an array of weapons. Such weapons include blades, electric blasts from wrist gauntlets, miniaturized [[torpedo]]es, and energy beams from his helmet. He also has a limited degree of expertise in mechanical engineering (as he was able to manufacture his suit, weaponry, and vehicles) and some amount of hand-to-hand combat training.

Black Manta oftentimes utilizes unique vehicles such as a modified, manta ray shaped, [[submarine]].

At some point Black Manta was transformed by the demon [[Neron]] into a Manta hybrid. In this form he was completely at one with the water and could dive to extreme depths and survive. He had natural weaponry, a tail that he could use as a weapon. The process has since been reversed by Aquaman.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions and notable appearances==
[[Image:Jlunlimited26.jpg|thumb|Black Manta vs. the [[Justice League]].]]
*Black Manta appeared in animated style in ''[[DC Animated Universe Comics#Justice League Adventures/Justice League Unlimited|Justice League Unlimited]]'' #26. He is aided by [[Felix Faust]] in an attempt to conquer Atlantis. Because of Felix Faust's appearance, the issue is out of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]].
*Black Manta appeared as one of the major villains in the 2005-2006 ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' miniseries by [[Alex Ross]] and [[Jim Krueger]].

==In other media==
===1960's and 70's Cartoons===
* Black Manta appeared as a regular villain on the ''Aquaman'' cartoon in the ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', where he was voiced by [[Ted Knight]].
* Manta also appeared on ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', where he was referred to simply as "Manta" and his suit color was now olive brown.
* Black Manta also became a part of the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', where he was voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]]. 
===Justice League/Justice League Unlimited===
* Black Manta was originally supposed to make an appearance in an early ''Justice League'' episode "The Enemy Below, Part 1." He was intended to be the one that [[Ocean Master|Orm]] hired to assassinate Aquaman. They changed it to [[Deadshot]], however, since it wouldn't have been suitable for Manta's character.<ref>[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode3/episode3.htm "The Enemy Below"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' a character named '''[[Devil Ray (Justice League Unlimited)|Devil Ray]]''', voiced by [[Michael Beach]], debuted as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] (based on the Legion of Doom). Devil Ray is closely based on Black Manta, right down to helmet and a suit that allowed him to breathe underwater and withstand deep-sea pressures. It was also equipped with rocket boosters that enabled him to fly and navigate underwater, and two wrist-mounted guns. The guns in his gauntlets allow him to shoot poisonous or explosive stingers or laser bolts at his targets, and also an array of venomous or explosive trident-shaped stingers. The suit itself heavily resembles the suit Black Manta wore in the Filmation ''Aquaman'' cartoons. Devil Ray appeared in major roles in "To Another Shore" and "Dead Reckoning" (the latter of which saw him accidentally killed by a [[Deadman]]-possessed Batman). Devil Ray may very well be the "[[DC animated universe]]" version of Black Manta. According to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], the reason behind the name change is because the rights to Aquaman characters were not available at the time, as they were being used for the [[Aquaman (TV program)|''Aquaman'' TV pilot]].<ref>[http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?showtopic=2615400&view=findpost&p=3660878 Justice League - TWoP Forums<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Within mainstream comics, in Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #52, the new Aquaman (Arthur Joseph Curry) inquires if Black Manta is the name of a cartoon character, and is corrected "...wasn't he called Devil Ray?", a reference to the character in ''Justice League Unlimited''. 
===Batman the Brave and the Bold===
[[Image:manta batman.gif|right|thumb|Black Manta as he appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''.]]
* Black Manta appears in the third episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. This interpretation of him shows him as a sociopathic assassin, hired by [[Ocean Master|Orm]] in order to kill Aquaman. When Orm succeeds in capturing Aquaman and becomes "Ocean Master", Black Manta betrays him and imprisons him. He plans to use a machine to destroy and plunder Atlantis, but was stopped by Aquaman, Ocean Master, and [[Batman]]. He was arrested and locked in [[Iron Heights]]. He appears again in the episode "Enter the Outsiders!" where he is robbing an armored car only to be defeated by Batman and [[B'wana Beast]].  Black Manta appears again in "Game Over for Owlman" where he teams with [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] and a group of villains to kill their respective enemies, but is stopped by Batman and his many parallel universe counterparts.  Black Manta makes a brief cameo appearance in "Night of the Huntress", where he is seen amongst other inmates in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]].  In "Deep Cover for Batman", it's revealed that Black Manta has a heroic conterpart in a parallel universe, who somewhat resembles Aquaman. In "Mayhem of the Music Miester" Black Manta along with [[Gorilla Grodd]] and [[Clock King]] are mindcontrolled by the Music Miester. It was also revealed, when in [[Iron Heights]], he is put in a giant fish bowl.

===Film===
* Black Manta has a cameo appearance in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. He is seen during the famous speech by [[John F. Kennedy]].
* Black Manta appears in the animated movie ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' where he is one of the many supervillains trying to collect the bounty on Superman.

===Video games===
* Black Manta appears as the main villain in the [[video game]] ''[[Aquaman: Battle for Atlantis]]'' for [[Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]. He is also an unlockable character in the game.
* Black Manta is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

===Spoofs and parodies===
* A parody of Black Manta called Black Eel appeared in the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' episode "Till Doom Do Us Part" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He was one of the villains assembled by Agent Roboto to form the Legion of Duck Doom in order to defeat Duck Dodgers (despite the fact he was the only villain in the episode who had never met him before and had no idea who he was). He's also the enemy of Seaman.
* Popular ''[[The Venture Bros.|Venture Bros.]]'' antagonist [[Monarch (The Venture Bros.)|The Monarch]] is said to have been partially based on the Manta (the creators developed his voice by imagining a skit in which Manta and Aquaman were college roommates, only to discover later that the voice used in ''Super Friends'' was radically different than they'd remembered).{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The Manta was also mentioned in one episode where [[Order of the Triad#Members|Jefferson Twilight]] believed him to be [[Aquaman]]'s sole villain, a suggestion proved wrong by [[Doctor Byron Orpheus|Dr. Orpheus]].
* Black Manta appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "But Not In That Way" voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. In a segment that parodies Arkham Asylum in the style of ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', Black Manta narrates about the [[Joker (comics)|Joker's]] life in Arkham and how he became friends with him. His voice and role parody is that of [[Morgan Freeman]]'s character from that film.
* ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' features a spoof villain called "Man Ray", who's directly inspired by Black Manta, including a similar appearance and many of the same powers. In the spoof, he's even named the most dangerous of the villains the Aquaman spoof ("Mermaid Man") has ever faced. In his later appearances, however, he's portrayed as only being evil when he feels like he's being mistreated.
