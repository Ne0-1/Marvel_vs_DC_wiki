'''Black Manta''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[DC Comics]], primarily as an [[archenemy]] of [[Aquaman]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
The boy who would become Black Manta was an [[autistic]] youth who grew up in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and loved to play by the sea. As a youth he was kidnapped, raped and forced to work on a ship for an unspecified amount of time. At one point he apparently saw [[Aquaman]] with his dolphin friends and tried to signal him for help but was not seen. Finally, he was forced to defend himself, killing one of his tormentors on the ship with a knife. Hating the emotionless sea (and Aquaman, who he saw as its representative), the boy was determined to become its master.<ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 4, #6</ref>

As an adult, he designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with bug-eyed helmet that was able to shoot blasting rays from its eyes) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by [[Manta ray|black manta rays]]. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a force to be reckoned with, engaging in at least one unrecorded clash with Aquaman previous to his first appearance as a rival to [[Ocean Master|the Ocean Master]] (and before joining the short-lived [[Injustice League]] in the [[retcon]] ''Silver Age'' third week event).

===Nemesis===

The fearsome, 6'4" Black Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years. During one of these clashes, it was revealed that Black Manta was actually an [[African-American]] man (which is why he called himself ''Black'' Manta), whose stated objective at one point was for black people to be dominant in the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land (though this goal was revealed to be a ruse he used to trick [[Cal Durham]] into following him, and this objective was not at all evident in either his earlier or later appearances). During most of his appearances his main goals were defeating Aquaman and gaining power for himself through the conquest of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. Finally, Manta killed Arthur Curry, Jr., Aquaman's son, which left Aquaman in a depression but also obessessed with getting revenge against Black Manta.<ref>''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #452, [[1977]] </ref>

Black Manta later sold his soul to the demon [[Neron]] in exchange for more power, and transformed into a Manta/Man hybrid. He took to wearing a new costume that completely covered his appearance, and inexplicably stopped tormenting Aquaman and instead indulged in drug smuggling from his new base in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. Here, he was opposed by [[Green Arrow]] and Aquaman.

In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the [[Lady of the Lake]]'s Healing Hand, reversed Neron's alterations to Black Manta, and rewired Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life. Unfortunately, Manta remained a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process.

In later events, Black Manta was used as a test subject to make water breathers, using genetic manipulation. This succeeded and since then Black Manta has returned to the oceans to face Aquaman once again.

He was apparently killed by Aquaman in anger, after causing a disturbance in [[Sub Diego]] in which Captain Marley was severely injured (''Aquaman v4'' #39). Aquaman summoned various predatory sea-life to attack Black Manta and left him for dead. He appears, however, in ''[[Villains United]]'' #1 and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, even gracing the cover. Vice President—Executive Editor [[Dan DiDio]] later confirmed that he is not dead.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/WWLA06/DC/DCU_OYL.html]</ref>, as later he robs his former henchman [[Cal Durham]] of his authority on Sub Diego <ref>''Aquaman v4'' #52</ref>

Black Manta appeared as one of the major villains in the 2005-2006 ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' mini-series by [[Alex Ross]] and [[Jim Krueger]].

==Other versions==
[[Image:Jlunlimited26.jpg|thumb|Black Manta vs. the [[Justice League]].]]
Black Manta appeared in animated style in ''Justice League Unlimited'' #26.  He is aided by [[Felix Faust]] in attempt to conquer Atlantis.  Because of Felix Faust's appearance, the issue is out of continuity.

==In other media==
* Black Manta appeared as a regular villain on the ''Aquaman'' cartoon in the ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', were he was voiced by [[Ted Knight]]. Manta also appeared on ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', where he was referred to simply as "Manta" and his suit color was now olive brown. Manta also became a part of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', where he was voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].
* Black Manta was originally supposed to make an appearance in an early ''Justice League'' episode "The Enemy Below, Part 1." He was intended to be the one that [[Ocean Master|Orm]] hired to assassinate Aquaman. They changed it to [[Deadshot]], however, since it wouldn't have been suitable for his character.<ref>[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode3/episode3.htm]</ref>
* [[Devil Ray (Justice League Unlimited)|Devil Ray]], a character that is closely based off of Black Manta (right down to the almost-identical character design), debuted as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains|Secret Society]]/[[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. According to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], the reason behind this is because the rights to Aquaman characters were no longer available.<ref>[http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?showtopic=2615400&view=findpost&p=3660878]</ref> He was accidentally killed by [[Deadman]] in the Justice League Unlimited episode "Dead Reckoning." 
* Black Manta appears as the main villain in the [[video game]] ''[[Aquaman: Battle for Atlantis]]'' for [[Xbox]] and [[Gamecube]]. He is also an unlockable character in the game.
* A parody of Black Manta called Black Eel appeared in the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' episode "[[Till Doom Do Us Part]]" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He was one of the villains assembled by Agent Roboto to form the Legion of Duck Doom. He's also the enemy of Seaman.
* Popular ''[[Venture Bros.]]'' antagonist [[The Monarch]] is said to have been partially based on the Manta (the creators developed his voice by imagining a skit in which Manta and Aquaman were college roommates, only to discover later that the voice used in ''Super Friends'' was radically different than they'd remembered).{{Fact|date=November 2007}} The Manta was also mentioned in one episode where [[Jefferson Twilight]] believed him to be [[Aquaman]]'s sole villain, a suggestion proved wrong by [[Dr. Orpheus]].
* Black Manta appeared in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Krazy Kripples]]" as part of [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Legion of Doom.

==Devil Ray==

'''Devil Ray''' is a [[supervillain]] on the [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. He was voiced by [[Michael Beach]]. 

===Fictional character biography===
Unlike most of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]], Devil Ray was not a pre-existing [[DC Comics]] character. This is particularly notable since DC comics and [[Challenge of the SuperFriends]] did include an Aquatic based supervillain with a diving suit, [[Black Manta]]. However, Black Manta could not be used in the show  since, according to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], the rights to [[Aquaman]] characters were no longer available.<ref>[http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?showtopic=2615400&view=findpost&p=3660878]</ref> Devil Ray, a resilient fighter and ruthless killer, was asked by [[Gorilla Grodd]] to join his expanding [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] (a.k.a. Legion of Doom). An obvious choice because Devil Ray takes great pleasure and pride in his heinous work. Devil Ray’s armour was greatly advanced by [[Lex Luthor]], and Grodd put the [[souped up|souped-up]] Devil Ray to the test when he sent Devil Ray out on a mission to retrieve the corpse of the Viking Prince, an ancient warrior that Grodd believed held the key to invulnerability, from a melting glacier. When [[Wonder Woman]] confronted him and a few other members, Devil Ray shot her with a poison dart, and if not for [[King Faraday]], he would have killed her. When the Viking ship was thawed out, Devil Ray towed it with a submarine, and was followed by Wonder Woman.  He engaged the Amazon to fight in an underwater battle, after nearly poisoning Wonder Woman on the surface, and even though Devil Ray was in his "natural" environment, Wonder Woman defeated him by catching him off-guard and cracking his helmet with her legs from behind, leaving him adrift. After having his armor destroyed Devil Ray was handed over to authorities to be put away, but he soon escaped to rejoin the Society.

Not long after, Devil Ray was sent on another mission. This time he was sent steal the Heart of Nanda Parbat. Devil Ray wouldn't allow anyone to stop him on this mission, so he disposed of the monastery's Master, [[Deadman]]'s mentor. This allowed Luthor and [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] to steal the power force needed to enact Grodd's scheme. Later on, when the Legion assailed Gorilla City, Deadman possessed Wonder Woman's body to take revenge against Devil Ray, and beat him to a pulp. After the Legion was defeated, Devil Ray attempted to kill Wonder Woman. Attempting to save Diana, Deadman lunged into [[Batman]]'s body. The possessed Batman shot Devil Ray with a found gun, causing him to fly backwards into a console panel which electrocuted him.

===Powers and abilities===
Devil Ray wore a suit that allowed him to breathe underwater and withstand deep-sea pressures. It was also equipped with rocket boosters that enabled him to fly and navigate underwater, and two wrist-mounted guns. Lex Luthor augmented his abilities and in this form, Devil Ray acquired super strength and stamina. He had enough strength, speed and invulnerability to challenge Wonder Woman and live. The guns in his gauntlets allow him to shoot poisonous or explosive stingers or laser bolts at his targets, and also an array of venomous or explosive trident-shaped stingers.
