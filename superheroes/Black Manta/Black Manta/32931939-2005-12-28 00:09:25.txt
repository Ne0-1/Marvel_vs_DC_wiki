'''Black Manta''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[DC Comics]], primarily as an opponent of [[Aquaman]].

==Background==
The boy who would become Black Manta screamed uncontrollably in his orphanage whenever he was put to bed. No one knew the feel of the cotton sheets was agonizing to him, nor that icy cold [[water]] had the opposite effect.  The boy was severely [[autistic]], and as a result was subjected to various experimental treatments.  One of these treatments seemed to bring the boy to a normal level of cognizance, but also brought out a streak of rage and violence.

The boy saw images of Aquaman on television, and was drawn to the sight of a man completely submerged in his beloved water.  As an adult, the orphan designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with bug-eyed helmet) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by [[Manta ray|black manta fish]].  Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a force to be reckoned with, engaging in several as-yet-unrecorded clashes with Aquaman before joining the short-lived [[Injustice League]] and later [[Ocean Master|Orm the Ocean Master]]. 

Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years, until the day Manta killed Arthur III, Aquaman's son. Prior to Arthur III's death, which drove Aquaman to becoming obessessed with getting revenge against Black Manta, it was revealed that Black Manta was actually an [[African-American]] man (and that this is why he called himself ''Black'' Manta), whose objective was for the Black people to be dominant in the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land.  Most of Black Manta's henchmen were also black.

Black Manta later sold his soul to the demon [[Neron]] in exchange for more power, and transformed into a Manta/Man hybrid.  He took to wearing a new costume that completely covered his appearance, and inexplicably stopped tormenting Aquaman and instead indulged in drug smuggling from his new base in Star City.  Here, he was opposed by [[Green Arrow]] and Aquaman.

In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the [[Lady of the Lake]]'s Healing Hand, reversed Neron's alterations to Black Manta, and rewired Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life.  Unfortunately, Manta remained a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process.

In recent events, Black Manta was used as a test subject to make water breathers, using genetic manipulation. This succeeded and Black Manta has now returned to the oceans to face Aquaman once again.

==Other media==
* Black Manta appeared as a regular villain on the ''Aquaman'' cartoon series of the late 1960s; he was also part of the [[Legion of Doom]] in the popular ''[[Super Friends]]'' cartoon where he had three different incarnations. For instance, his name was changed to simply "Manta" and his suit color to olive brown in a later season (apparently due to his politically harsh secret).
* Black Manta debuted as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] shown in the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the show, the character was renamed '''Devil Ray''' since, according to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], the rights to Aquaman were no longer available.

He was voiced by [[Michael Beach]].
