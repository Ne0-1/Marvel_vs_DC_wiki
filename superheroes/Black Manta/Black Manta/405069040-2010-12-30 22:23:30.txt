'''Black Manta''' is a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[DC Comics]], primarily as the [[archenemy]] of [[Aquaman]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link =|contribution = Black Manta|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 52|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> The character debuted in ''Aquaman'' #35 (September 1967).

==Fictional character biography==
For most of his publishing history, Black Manta had no definitive origin story. The first was given in #6 of the 1993 ''Aquaman'' series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta grew up in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], and loved to play by the sea. As a youth he was kidnapped and sexually abused on a ship for an unspecified amount of time. At one point he apparently saw [[Aquaman]] with his [[dolphin]] friends and tried to signal him for help but was not seen. Finally, he was forced to defend himself, killing one of his tormentors on the ship with a knife. Hating the emotionless sea (and Aquaman, whom he saw as its representative), the boy was determined to become its master.<ref name="aquaman6">''Aquaman vol. 4, #6'', 1993, DC Comics, writer  Shaun McLaughlin</ref>

A second origin was given in #8 of the 2003 ''Aquaman'' series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta was an orphan who has [[autism]] and was placed in [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]]. He felt comfortable in freezing cold water, while cotton sheets were excruciatingly painful. Because the attendants at Arkham didn't know how to deal with autism, they would end up restraining him to the bed as he struggled and screamed whenever they tried putting him there. The boy was also fascinated when he saw Aquaman on television.

The boy would end up being subjected to experimental treatments. One treatment seemed to clear the boy's head, but left him violent as a result; he killed the scientist who had administered the treatment and escaped from Arkham.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name="aquaman8">''Aquaman vol. 6, #8'', 2003, DC Comics, writer Rick Veitch</ref>

As an adult, the man who would become Black Manta designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with bug-eyed helmet, that was able to shoot blasting rays from its eyes) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by [[manta ray]]s. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a force to be reckoned with, engaging in at least one unrecorded clash with Aquaman prior to his first appearance as a rival to the [[Ocean Master]] (and before joining the short-lived [[Injustice League]] in the [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] ''Silver Age'' third week event).

The fearsome Black Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years. During one of these clashes,<ref name="Adventure Comics #452, 1977">''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #452, 1977 </ref> it was revealed that Black Manta was actually an [[African American]], whose stated objective at one point was for [[black people]] to be dominant in the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land (though this goal was revealed to be a ruse he used to trick [[Cal Durham]] into following him, and this objective was not at all evident in either his earlier or later appearances). During most of his appearances, his main goals were defeating Aquaman and gaining power for himself through the conquest of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. Finally, Manta kills Arthur Curry, Jr., Aquaman's son, which left Aquaman obsessed with revenge.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name="Adventure Comics #452, 1977"/>

Black Manta was later transformed into a manta/man hybrid. After a while he went back to wearing his original outfit, which covered his new appearance. At one point he took to drug smuggling from his new base in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], where he was opposed by a returning [[Green Arrow]] and Aquaman.

In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the [[Lady of the Lake]]'s Healing Hand, reverses the alterations to Black Manta, and rewired Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life. Unfortunately, Manta remained a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process.

In later events, Black Manta was used as a test subject to make water breathers, using genetic manipulation. This succeeded and since then Black Manta has returned to the oceans to face Aquaman once again.

Black Manta caused a disturbance in [[Sub Diego]] in which Captain Marley was severely injured. <ref>''Aquaman'' vol. 4 #39</ref> Aquaman summoned various predatory sea-life to attack Black Manta and left him for dead. It was later revealed that he was able to survive by generating an electric charge with his suit.

One year later, he took over Sub Diego but was forced to flee when [[King Shark]] bit off his face.<ref>''Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis'' #52–53</ref>

He can be seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

During the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' storyline, Black Manta is next seen working in a fish market. When the local news and his customers revel in the return of Aquaman, Manta leaps over the counter and kills them with his knife. Black Manta is later seen burning a shorefront house to the ground and walking into the ocean. He immediately leaps out wearing his Black Manta costume and yelling "Aquaman."<ref>''Brightest Day'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>

Black Manta is seen later at Thomas Curry, Aquaman's father's tombstone, where he is approached by Siren and her Death Squad after demolishing the tombstone. The Death Squad began fighting Black Manta but before the fight can get too far along, Siren stops them. She tells Black Manta that they need to work together to find his son, as she makes a hard water image of [[Aqualad|Jackson Hyde]].<ref name="bd9"/> Black Manta and Siren track down Jackson and attempts to kill his foster father. Jackson (using his ability to create hard water constructs) defends his foster father, but cannot stop Black Manta from shooting a trident-shaped dart at his foster father. Aquaman then arrives on the scene blocking and crushing the dart.Black Manta prepares to face his old nemesis again.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #10 (September 2010)</ref> During the battle, Aquaman pulls Jackson and his foster father to safety from Black Manta and Siren.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #11 (October 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Black Manta's suit is specifically designed to [[adaptation|adapt]] him to an oceanic environment. It allows him complete resistance to the cold and pressure of deep sea conditions and thus grants him a level of [[superhuman]] durability, and strength (allowing Black Manta to lift/strike with the force of 5 [[ton]]s), the ability to breathe normally underwater (whether this is due to a hidden oxygen supply or its ability to extract oxygen from the water like the [[gill]]s of a fish is unknown), jet boots which function in or out of water, a [[telepathy|telepathic]] scrambler (used to temporarily strip [[Aquaman]] of his aquatic telepathy), and an array of weapons. Such weapons include blades, electric blasts from wrist gauntlets, miniaturized [[torpedo]]es, and energy beams from his helmet. He also has a limited degree of expertise in mechanical engineering (as he was able to manufacture his suit, weaponry, and vehicles) and some amount of hand-to-hand combat training.

Black Manta oftentimes utilizes unique vehicles such as a modified, manta ray shaped, [[submarine]].

At some point Black Manta was transformed by the demon [[Neron]] into a Manta hybrid. In this form he was completely at one with the water and could dive to extreme depths and survive. He had natural weaponry, a tail that he could use as a weapon. The process has since been reversed by Aquaman.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
* Black Manta appeared as one of the major villains in the 2005-2006 ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' miniseries by [[Alex Ross]] and [[Jim Krueger]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* Black Manta appeared as a regular villain on the ''Aquaman'' cartoon in ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' voiced by [[Ted Knight]].

* Manta also appeared on ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', where he was referred to simply as "Manta" and his suit color was now olive brown.

* Black Manta also became a part of the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].

* Black Manta was originally supposed to make an appearance in an early ''Justice League'' episode "The Enemy Below, Part 1." He was intended to be the one that [[Ocean Master|Orm]] hired to assassinate Aquaman. They changed it to [[Deadshot]] however since it wouldn't have been suitable for Manta's character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode3/episode3.htm |title="The Enemy Below" |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref>

[[File:Devil Ray.jpg|thumb|180px|"Devil Ray" from ''Justice League Unlimited'']]
* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' a character named '''Devil Ray''' (voiced by [[Michael Beach]]) debuted as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] (based on the Legion of Doom). Devil Ray is closely based on Black Manta, right down to helmet and a suit that allowed him to breathe underwater and withstand deep-sea pressures. It was also equipped with rocket boosters that enabled him to fly and navigate underwater, and two wrist-mounted guns. The guns in his gauntlets allow him to shoot laser bolts at his targets, and also an array of venomous or explosive trident-shaped stingers. The suit itself heavily resembles the suit Black Manta wore in the Filmation ''Aquaman'' cartoons. Devil Ray appeared in major roles in "To Another Shore" and "Dead Reckoning" (the latter of which saw him accidentally killed by a [[Deadman]]-possessed Batman). According to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], the reason behind the name change is because the rights to Aquaman characters were not available at the time, as they were being used for the [[Aquaman (TV program)|''Aquaman'' TV pilot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?showtopic=2615400&view=findpost&p=3660878 |title=Justice League - TWoP Forums |publisher=Forums.televisionwithoutpity.com |date=2005-09-24 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref> Within mainstream comics, in Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #52, the new Aquaman (Arthur Joseph Curry) inquires if Black Manta is the name of a cartoon character, and is corrected "...wasn't he called Devil Ray?" , a presumed reference to the character in ''Justice League Unlimited''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

In "Mayhem of the Music Meister" Black Manta along with [[Gorilla Grodd]] and [[Clock King]] are mindcontrolled by the [[Music Meister]]. It was also revealed that, when in [[Iron Heights]], he is put in a giant fish bowl.

* It has been confirmed by producers Brandon Vietti and [[Greg Weisman]] that the new [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]] in the upcoming ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series will be Black Manta's son.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Kevin |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/comic-con-2010-young-justice |title=Comic-Con 2010: Young Justice |publisher=UGO.com |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref> It is unknown if he will actually appear in the series.

===Spoofs and parodies===
* A parody of Black Manta called Black Eel appeared in the ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' episode "Till Doom Do Us Part" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He was one of the villains assembled by Agent Roboto to form the Legion of Duck Doom in order to defeat Duck Dodgers (despite the fact he was the only villain in the episode who had never met him before and had no idea who he was). He's also the enemy of Seaman.
* Popular ''[[The Venture Bros.|Venture Bros.]]'' antagonist [[Monarch (The Venture Bros.)|The Monarch]] is said to have been partially based on the Manta (the creators developed his voice by imagining a skit in which Manta and Aquaman were college roommates, only to discover later that the voice used in ''Super Friends'' was radically different than they'd remembered).{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The Manta was also mentioned in the episode "What Goes Down, must Come Up" where [[Order of the Triad#Members|Jefferson Twilight]] talks with [[Doctor Byron Orpheus]] about what it is that [[Aquaman]] actually does, wherein Doctor Orpheus states, "I thought he fought Black Manta."
* Black Manta appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "But Not In That Way" voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. In a segment that parodies [[Arkham Asylum]] in the style of ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', Black Manta narrates about the [[Joker (comics)|Joker's]] life in Arkham and how he became friends with him. His voice and role parody is that of [[Morgan Freeman]]'s character from that film.
* ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' features a spoof villain called "Man Ray", who appears to be inspired by Black Manta, including a similar appearance and many of the same powers. In the episode "Mermaidman and Barnacleboy III", he's even named (next to the "Dirty Bubble") as the all-time greatest archnemesis of the Aquaman spoof ("Mermaid Man"). In his later appearances{{Episode|date=January 2010}}, however, he's portrayed as only being evil when he feels like he's being mistreated.
* In one episode of the Super Friends, an undersea villain named "The Sculpin" wears an outfit identical to Black Manta with the exception that it was colored green.

* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, "[[It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One]]" Lois convinced the town in a press conference that the Legion of Doom is conspiring with [[Adolf Hitler]] to assassinate [[Jesus]]. The scene then jumps to the Hall of Doom where Lex Luthor shouts "How did she discover our plan?!". Solomon Grundy admits he "kind of dropped the ball on that one." Almost all of the original Legion is portrayed, except for the Riddler. Black Manta was attending the meeting although he didn't have any speaking lines.

* In the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode "Peanut Puberty," the headquarters for the Legion of Doom was used for a club called the "Legion of Dance." Black Manta makes an appearance as a background character.

* The Legion of Doom was referenced in the animated series ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Krazy Kripples]]" featured [[Christopher Reeve]] (who portrayed [[Superman]] in the movies) forming his own version of the Legion of Doom, complete with the Hall of Doom as their headquarters; its main goal, according to Reeve, was to kill [[Gene Hackman]] (aka [[Lex Luthor]] in the movies: as a news reporter said "if irony were made out of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now"). It included both parodies of actual LoD villains ([[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], and [[Black Manta]]), at least two Marvel villain parodies ([[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Doctor Doom]]) and villains from the South Park universe (such as [[Butters Stotch#Professor Chaos|Professor Chaos]], [[General Disarray]], [[David Blaine]] and [[Saddam Hussein]], as well as [[Osama Bin Laden]] and [[Kim Jong Il]]).
* A Cartoon Network bumper featured [[The Powerpuff Girls]] saving Aquaman and Wonder Woman from the Legion of Doom's clutches. It can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91KK09FAux4 here on YouTube] Black Manta attends their meeting and attempts to fight the Power Puff Girs, but he is soundly beaten along with the rest of he Legion of Doom. At the end they all share a hearty laugh villains and heroes alike, when Bubbles sais that she wants to become as "developed" as Wonder Woman.

* In 2003, [[Cartoon Network Latin America]] aired the spoof series ''[[Aquaman in popular media#The Aquaman & Friends Action Hour|The Aquaman & Friends Action Hour]]'' that starred Aquaman as a children's television show host and the Legion of Doom as his bankrupt villains. Black Manta i als present a member of the Legion of Doom.
