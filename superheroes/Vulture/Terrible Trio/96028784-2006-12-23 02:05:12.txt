The '''Terrible Trio''' is the name of a [[DC Comics]] group of three supervillains. The Trioâ€™s first appearance was [[Detective Comics]] # 253, published in March of 1958. The real names of Fox, Shark and Vulture were originally Warren Kawford, Armand Lydecker & Gunther Hardwick - though these have changed over the decades. 

==History==
The Terrible Trio were originally three famous inventors in [[Gotham City]], who sought new challenges by starting a criminal career. As a gimmick, they dressed up in business suits while wearing cartoon masks of animals. From then on, they were known as the Fox, the Shark and the Vulture. Tapping into their respective areas of expertise, they based their technology on their respective animal themes. The Trio were recurrent foes of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] for years, but they have also battled [[G'nort]], and, more recently, the new [[Doctor Mid-Nite]].

In the Doctor Mid-Nite mini series, the three have moved their operations to Portsmouth instead of Gotham, and have become the industrial leaders Fisk, Shackley, and Volper, heads of the investment firm Preada Industries (Praeda meaning "spoils" or "booty", and sharing a root with the word "predator").  In this story, the Trio adopt their guises as part of vaguely [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] rituals they perform to bring good fortune to their endevaours, calling upon the spirits of earth, air, and water.  The trio attempted to cause simultaneous disasters to much of the city and its coast, leaving only the property in the worst sections of the city - which they owned and could then resell to enormous profit.  As part of thier plan, the Trio also operated as drug lords, selling the [[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]]-based steroid A39 to create an army of superstrong zombie-like soldiers.  When Doctor Cross began investigating their affairs they attempted to kill him, but succeeded only in apparently blinding him (unbeknownst to them he gained the abilities that would make him Doctor Mid-Nite).  Mid-Nite foiled their plans for the city, and the Trio were caught and sentenced to a total of 800 years in prison.

== Revamping the Shark ==
In more recent ''Batman'' titles, and within miniseries such as ''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell'' (2003), a new Shark has emerged as his own villain independent of the Trio[ see: [[Great White (comics)]] ]

In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the Terrible Trio were bored, rich men with influence and power who turned to crime. They assumed the identities of Vulture, Shark and Fox, representing Air, Water, and Land respectively. They struck Gotham hard but were sent to jail by Batman. Fox was played by [[Bill Mumy]], Shark was played by [[Peter Scolari]], and Vulture was played by [[David Jolliffe]].
