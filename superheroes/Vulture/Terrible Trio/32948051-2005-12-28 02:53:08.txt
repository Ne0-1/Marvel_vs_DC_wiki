The Terrible Trio is the name of a [[DC Comics]] supervillain group made up of only 3 members.

==History==
The Terrible Trio were originally three famous inventors in [[Gotham City]], who sought new challenges by starting a criminal career. As a gimmick, they dressed up in business suits while wearing cartoon masks of animals. From now on, they would be known as the Fox, the Shark and the Vulture. Tapping into their respective areas of expertise, they base their technology on their respective animal themes. The Trio were recurrent foes of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] for years, but they have also battled [[G'nort]], and, more recently, the new [[Doctor Mid-Nite]]. Now based in Portsmouth instead of Gotham, the Trio have started a new criminal career as industrial leaders Fisk, Shackley, and Volper.

In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', The Terrible Trio were bored, rich men with influence and power. Know what happens when these three men become bored and ache for something more exciting and deadly? They turn to crime. These three criminals, representing Air, Water, and Land, struck Gotham hard but were brought down mighty quickly by Batman. In the end, all their money and influence couldn't stop them from going to jail, where criminals like them belong. Fox is played by [[Bill Mumy]], Shark is played by [[Peter Scolari]], and Vulture is played by [[David Jolliffe]].
