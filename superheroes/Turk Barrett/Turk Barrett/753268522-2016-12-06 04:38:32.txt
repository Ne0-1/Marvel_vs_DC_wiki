** Turk first appears in the first season of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', where he is an enforcer engaged in human trafficking, and is also an arms dealer who has a love of semi-automatic pistols and takes personal pleasure in criminal activities. In the episode "World on Fire," [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] pays Turk Barrett to reveal to Vladimir Ranskahov that his brother Anatoly was killed by Fisk. In the season 1 finale, Turk is among those who are arrested by the FBI for his association with Fisk's empire. Prior to the start of season 2 of ''Daredevil'', Turk is paroled from prison and quickly returns to arms dealing. He is briefly seen selling shotguns to a gang. However, Daredevil intercepts the deal and interrogates him on weapons stolen from Fisk, suspecting them to have been used in the recent massacre of a faction of Kitchen Irish mobsters. Turk provides information that leads him to the Mexican Cartel and is knocked unconscious. In the episode "A Cold Day In Hell's Kitchen", Turk Barrett is among the victims saved by Daredevil that are abducted by the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] to lure Daredevil into a trap after stealing the files about it from the New York City Police Department's 15th Precinct. It turned out that Turk was on house arrest at the time where he is quietly advised by Karen Page to reactivate his [[ankle monitor]]. At the warehouse, the police arrive as the Hand Ninjas suspect Turk for his ankle montior being reactivated. Before the Hand Ninjas can cut off Turk's foot, Daredevil arrives and fights the Hand Ninjas as Karen helps to get an injured Turk and the other hostages away from the Hand and towards the present police officers.

He had a run-in with Misty Knight who noticed that Turk is outside of his usual turf. Turk then tips off Cottonmouth's henchman Tone to Chico's location which leads to Pop's death. Tone and [[Shades (comics)|Shades]] don't bother to give him the payment for the tip-off. Turk later arrives at the rooftop meeting between Cottonmouth, Tone, Shades, and [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]] where he wants the money that was promised to him for the tip-off even after Cottonmouth learned that Pops was killed in the crossfire. After witnessing Cottonmouth killing Tone by throwing him off the roof and onto the car below, Turk is told by Cottonmouth that he can pick up Tone's payment "downstairs." Turk states that he is returning to Hell's Kitchen where "it is safe" as he considers [[Harlem]]'s criminal underworld to be "too crazy".

Cage leaves him in a partially crushed trash bin, awaiting trash pickup in the morning.
