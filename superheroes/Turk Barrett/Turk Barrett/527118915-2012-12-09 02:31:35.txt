Turk Barrett was a small-time crook associated with Eric Slaughter and The Kingpin and before that with the Thunderbolts. Barrett once stole the Mauler armor to unsuccessfully confronted Daredevil, Barrett, however, is defeated in seconds.<ref>''Daredevil'' #176 (Nov. 1981)</ref>  Turk later stole the [[Stilt Man|Stilt-Man armor]].

The original creator of the Stilt-Man armor, Wilbur Day, contacted Daredevil with knowledge of how to defeat Barrett.<ref>'''Daredevil''' #179</ref> 

Turk has spent quite a bit of time at Josie's Bar in New York City. His primary associate is "Grotto" who often reluctantly participates in Turk's schemes.
