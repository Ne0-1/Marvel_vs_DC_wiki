* At the start of Season 3 of ''Daredevil'', Tower is incensed when the FBI let [[Wilson Fisk]] out of prison as part of an informant deal. When Foggy tries to get him to pursue charges against Fisk, Tower refuses, which Foggy takes as a sign that Tower refuses to do anything against Fisk lest he compromise his chances of getting reelected. At Marci's suggestion, Foggy runs against Tower as a write-in candidate, and asks Brett Mahoney to introduce him to address a congregation of NYPD at a Police Union function. Foggy gains the endorsement of the NYPD for his write in campaign. Later, upon learning that Fisk is planning to make himself the sole source of government protection from prosecution for criminals in the city, Foggy decides to call Tower out on these allegations while Tower is speaking in a public forum. When Matt, Karen and Foggy are able to get Agent Ray Nadeem to speak out against Fisk, they arrange for him to make a plea bargain with Tower, though the attempt to use a grand jury deposition to stop Fisk ends up failing when Fisk threatens the grand jurors' lives. In the season 3 finale, he is among those who attend Father Lantom's funeral, and after the funeral, Foggy officially drops out of the race and endorses Tower's reelection campaign as he had promised earlier.
