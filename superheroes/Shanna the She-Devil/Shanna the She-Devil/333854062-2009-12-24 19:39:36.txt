'''Shanna the She-Devil''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] jungle adventuress in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by writers [[Carole Seuling]] and [[Steve Gerber]] and  [[penciler]] [[George Tuska]], she made her [[first appearance]] in ''Shanna the She-Devil'' #1 (Dec. 1972).

==Publication history==
''Shanna the She-Devil'' was introduced in one of a trio of Marvel Comics aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]]'' and ''[[Tigra|Claws of the Cat]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]]
{{cquote|had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for ways to expand our franchise. My idea ... was to try to get women to write them. ... I thought of my friend [[Carole Seuling]], who had done a bit of writing for her ex-husband Phil in conjunction with [[Comic Art Convention|his comic cons]]. I approached her to do the ''Shanna'' book because I knew she liked jungle comics and adventure comics.   ... I put [[Ross Andru]] on as the ''Shanna'' artist [beginning with issue #2], with [[Vince Colletta|Vinnie Colletta]] inking to make Ross' Shanna look attractive.<ref>''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 1970): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50</ref>}}

This initial series ran five issues (Dec. 1972 - Aug. 1973), with [[Jim Steranko]] drawing the covers of #1-2.

Shanna then starred in a solo feature in the black-and-white adventure-comics magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #9-10 (March & May 1975), in stories by writers [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Carla Conway]], with art by the collective [[pseudonym]] The Tribe for the first story, and by the former series' team of Andru & Colletta for the second.  She also appeared in a backup story in ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'' by Steve Gerber that introduced her psychologist.  It was the lead-in to a story that went unpublished and partially uncompleted until the penultimate four issues of ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' in the early 1990s.

Marvel has also published [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] versions of Shanna, unrelated except for the name.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Shanna2.jpg|left|thumb|''Shanna the She-Devil'' #2 (Feb. 1973). Cover art by [[Jim Steranko]]<!--per Grand Comics Database-->]]'''Shanna O'Hara Plunder''' is the daughter of a diamond miner named Gerald O'Hara. Born in [[Africa]], she spent the majority of her childhood growing up in the [[jungle]]s of [[Zaire]]. At the age of six, her father went to kill a rogue [[leopard]] that belonged to her mother, Patricia O'Hara. While hunting for the leopard, Shanna's father accidentally killed her mother. This traumatic incident led to Shanna's lifelong crusade against the use of [[firearms]]. After the incident, Shanna moved back to the [[United States]] to live with relatives. Shanna grows up to become an accomplished Olympic athlete, specializing in [[competitive swimming]] and [[track and field]]. She then became a licensed [[veterinarian]].

After completing college, Shanna began to work for the [[Central Park Zoo|Central Park Municipal Zoo]] in [[New York City]] as a [[zoology|zoologist]]. While working at the [[zoo]], Shanna raised many [[animal]]s, including a female leopard named Julani. During this period another shock to her system came when Julani was shot and killed by a zoo guard. This terrible incident led Shanna to quit the zoo and to take Julani's cubs, '''Ina''' and '''Biri''', to the Dahomey Reserve in Africa. 

While in Africa, Shanna becomes more attuned to nature, patrolling the jungle and living freely in the wild lands. She begins to wear nothing else but Julani's fur [[pelage|pelt]], as a [[bikini]], to help with the raising of the cubs. In the jungle, Shanna becomes more and more at home with herself and her new native element, all the while protecting the [[Nature reserve|reserve]] from [[poaching|poachers]] as Shanna the She-Devil.

During her stay in Africa, her father is [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]]. Shanna searches for him until the wizard [[Malgato]] [[kidnapping|kidnaps]] her to [[Antarctica]]'s [[Savage Land]], a [[Prehistoric life|prehistoric]] jungle. She escapes with the help of Lord Kevin Plunder, a.k.a. the jungle lord [[Ka-Zar]]. Shanna returns to Africa to look for her father, and learns he was killed by the Mandrill. Seeking revenge, she goes to America to aid [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] in stopping the Mandrill and [[Nekra]]'s plan to overthrow the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]]. 

After this, Shanna travels between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and the Savage Land, finally returning to Africa.  Only to find Ina and Biri have been killed by a religious cult leader, Raga-Shah. After a short grieving period in America, Shanna tracks and kills Raga-Shah. Around this time, she begins therapy with [[psychologist]] Dr. Dorothy Betz.

Later she moves to the Savage Land, where she and Ka-Zar fall in love, marry, and have a son, Matthew. Shanna and her husband fight to protect the quality of life of all natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitats]] from the encroachments of the modern world.

Some time later, she and Ka-Zar found what appeared to be [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents forcing Savage Landers into slavery-like conditions, under [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]]'s orders to mine the land's supply of vibranium. Here is where Ka-Zar ascertained the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull infiltration]] after Shanna accidentally killed one of the agents, though she refused to believe in the existence of Skrulls at first (having not known them due to the isolation of Savage Land from the foreign world and its communication means). Having infiltrated the operation for a few minutes, Shanna could not find out much about their motivations aside from discovering that the Skrulls had already infiltrated the [[New Avengers]] (in the form of [[Veranke|their own queen]], who was disguised as [[Jessica Drew|Spider-Woman]]), who would shut down the fake S.H.I.E.L.D. operations days later (still before the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]).

Later, Shanna and Ka-Zar ran into Spider-Man, who had just been flung from the massive battle between the modern-day heroes and the old-time heroes who emerged from the downed Skrull spaceship, and pictured that the invasion had taken major proportions, with Spider-Man accusing them (and possibly Zabu as well) of being Skrulls. Shanna, too, has suspicions about Spider-Man because he insists that her name is "Sheena", but Ka-Zar is convinced that that is the real Spider-Man before them. Shortly after, they are attacked by the ship's Captain America, who is eventually hit with a dart which makes him revert to his true Skrull form: that of a sleeper agent called Pitt'o Nili who, like all other heroes from the ship, had been brainwashed into thinking he was the real Captain America, keeping up this ruse even after being uncovered.<ref>''New Avengers'' #41 (July 2008) and #43 (Sept. 2008).</ref> Later, as Ka-Zar joins the Avengers headed to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion, Shanna stays in the Savage Land with Zabu to rid it from any remaining Skrulls.

==Powers and abilities==
Shanna is gifted with Olympic-class [[sportsperson|athleticism]] along with extraordinary agility. She is a well-trained [[veterinarian]], with the capability of being close to wild animals. Shanna is adept at [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]], healing and [[tracking]]. She is an experienced fighter, familiar with knives, spears, bows and arrows and other primitive forms of weapons. She has Olympic athlete-level Superhuman strength: naturally excelling at swimming, diving, climbing, leaping, and running with great speed and determination.

==Other versions==
A blond, [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] version of the character starred in the seven-issue [[miniseries]] ''Shanna, the She-Devil'' vol. 2 (April-Oct. 2005), written and drawn by [[Frank Cho]]. This Shanna is the result of a [[cloning|genetic experiment]] and she also has [[superhuman]] strength and agility. One member of a scientific expedition that encountered her named her Shanna after the "comic book character".

The series was originally scheduled for release under Marvel's "mature readers" [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint,{{Fact|date=November 2007}} but was reworked, with Cho eliminating the [[nudity]]  before publication. It ran with a "PSR+" rating through issue #4, and a "Parental Advisory" rating afterward. 

A four-issue sequel miniseries, ''Shanna The She-Devil: Survival of the Fittest'' (Oct. 2007 - Jan. 2008) by writers [[Justin Gray]] and [[James Palmiotti]] and penciler [[Khari Evans]], featured this same alternate version of Shanna. In [[Secret Invasion]], Earth-616 Shanna was rendered by Leinil Francis Yu very similar to Marvel MAX counterpart.

===Ultimate Shanna===
Shanna appears in Ultimate Marvel form in issue #3 with Ultimate Ka-Zar on the last page of Ultimates 3. They assist the Ultimates in driving out Magneto's forces from their home. Flashbacks reveal she, Ka-Zar and Zabu have been friends since childhood. At the conclusion of the storyline, she expresses the desire to see New York City or specifically 'any city'.
