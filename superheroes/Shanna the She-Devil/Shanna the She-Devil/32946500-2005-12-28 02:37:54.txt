==Character Biography==
'''Shanna O'Hara Plunder''' was the daughter of a diamond miner, named Gerald O'Hara. Being born in [[Africa]], she spent the majority of her childhood growing up in the [[Jungle|jungles]] of [[Zaire]]. At the age of six, her father went to kill a rogue [[leopard]], which belonged to her mother, Patricia O'Hara. While hunting for the leopard, Shanna's father accidentally shot her mother. The traumatizing incident began a lifelong crusade against the use of [[firearms]]. After the incident, Shanna moved back to the [[United States]] to live with relatives. With time, Shanna grew up to become a licenced [[veterinarian]].

After completing college, Shanna began to work for the [[Central Park Zoo|Central Park Municipal Zoo]], in [[New York City]], as a [[zoology|zoologist]]. While working at the [[zoo]], Shanna raised many [[Animal|animals]], including a female leopard named '''Julani'''. During this period in her life, an another shock to her system came, when Julani was shot and killed by a zoo guard. This terrible incident, gave Shanna reason to quit the zoo, and to take Julani's cubs, '''Ina''' and '''Biri''', to the Dahomey Reserve in Africa. 

While away in Africa, Shanna became more attuned to nature. She originally began wearing the fur of Julani, to help with the raising of the cubs. In the jungle, Shanna became more and more at home, with herself and her new native element, all the while protecting the [[Nature reserve|reserve]] from [[poacher|poachers]], as '''Shanna the She-Devil'''.

During her stay in Africa, her father was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by [[Mandrill(comics)|Mandrill]]. Shanna proceeded to search for him, until she, herself, was kidnapped, to the [[Savage Land]], by the wizard Malgato. She received help against Malgato, from '''Lord Kevin Plunder''' a.k.a. Ka-Zar. Shanna returned to Africa, to look for her father, until she learned that he was killed by Mandrill. Looking for revenge, she went to America, to aid [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] (Natasha), in stopping Mandrill's and [[Nekra]]'s plan to overthrow the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]]. 

After that, Shanna saw herself leaping all over the globe, from spending time in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], to the Savage Land, and back to Africa again. Yet her return to Africa, wasn't a pleasant one. Her leopards, Ina and Biri, were killed by a religious cult leader, Raga-Shah. After a short grieving period in America, Shanna tracked and gained vengeance upon Raga-Shah.

She later moved to the Savage Land, a [[Prehistoric life|prehistoric]] [[wildlife]] reserve in [[Antarctica]], where she and Ka-Zar fell in love, became married, and had a son, whom they named '''Matthew'''. Along with her husband, Shanna fights to keep safe the quality of life of all natural [[Habitat (ecology)|
habitats]], from the evils of the modern world.

==Abilities==
Shanna is gifted with an Olympic-class athleticism along with extraordinary agility. She is a well-trained veterinarian, with the capability to be close with wild animals. Shanna is well adapt at [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]], healing, and [[tracking]]. She is an experienced fighter, with familiarity with knives, spears, bows and arrows, and other primitive forms of weapons.

==Re-Imagined Shanna, the She-Devil==
The latest series starring a revamped version of the character, a seven-issue mini series called ''Shanna the She-Devil'', was released in 2005 and written and drawn by [[Frank Cho]].  The new Shanna, who has no ties to the original character, is the result of a genetic experiment, and has super-human strength and agility.  The series was originally scheduled for release under Marvel's "mature readers" [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint, but was rescheduled as a general title, with the nudity drawn out by Cho, though the violence remains fairly intact.
