'''Shanna the She-Devil''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Originally created as a derivative of [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]] (who was herself a female derivative of [[Tarzan]]), she later became the partner and wife of [[Ka-Zar]], Marvel's own derivative version of Tarzan. Created by [[Carole Seuling]], [[Steve Gerber]] and [[George Tuska]]. Her first appearance was in ''Shanna the She-Devil'' #1 (1972).

==Biography==
'''Shanna O'Hara Plunder''' was the daughter of a diamond miner named Gerald O'Hara. Born in [[Africa]], she spent the majority of her childhood growing up in the [[Jungle|jungles]] of [[Zaire]]. At the age of six, her father went to kill a rogue [[leopard]] which belonged to her mother, Patricia O'Hara. While hunting for the leopard, Shanna's father accidentally shot her mother. The traumatic incident led to Shanna's lifelong crusade against the use of [[firearms]]. After the incident, Shanna moved back to the [[United States]] to live with relatives. Shanna grew up to become a licensed [[veterinarian]].

After completing college, Shanna began to work for the [[Central Park Zoo|Central Park Municipal Zoo]] in [[New York City]] as a [[zoology|zoologist]]. While working at the [[zoo]], Shanna raised many [[Animal|animals]], including a female leopard named '''Julani'''. During this period another shock to her system came when Julani was shot and killed by a zoo guard. This terrible incident led Shanna to quit the zoo and to take Julani's cubs, '''Ina''' and '''Biri''', to the Dahomey Reserve in Africa. 

While in Africa, Shanna became more attuned to nature. She began wearing  Julani's fur to help with the raising of the cubs. In the jungle, Shanna became more and more at home with herself and her new native element, all the while protecting the [[Nature reserve|reserve]] from [[poaching|poachers]] as '''Shanna the She-Devil'''.

During her stay in Africa, her father was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]]. Shanna searched for him until she herself was kidnapped to the [[Savage Land]] by the wizard Malgato. She received help against Malgato from '''Lord Kevin Plunder''' a.k.a. Ka-Zar. Shanna returned to Africa to look for her father, until she learned that he was killed by Mandrill. Looking for revenge, she went to America to aid [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] in stopping Mandrill and [[Nekra]]'s plan to overthrow the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]]. 

After that, Shanna traveled between [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and the Savage Land, finally returning to Africa. Yet her return to Africa wasn't a pleasant one. Her leopards, Ina and Biri, were killed by a religious cult leader, Raga-Shah. After a short grieving period in America, Shanna tracked and gained vengeance upon Raga-Shah.  Around this time she began seeing a [[psychologist]], Dr. Dorothy Betz.

She later moved to the Savage Land, a [[Prehistoric life|prehistoric]] [[wildlife]] reserve in [[Antarctica]], where she and Ka-Zar fell in love, married, and had a son whom they named '''Matthew'''. Along with her husband, Shanna fights to protect the quality of life of all natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitats]] from the encroachments of the modern world.

==Abilities==
Shanna is gifted with Olympic-class [[athlete|athleticism]] along with extraordinary agility. She is a well-trained [[veterinarian]], with the capability to be close with wild animals. Shanna is adept at [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]], healing and [[tracking]]. She is an experienced fighter, with familiarity with knives, spears, bows and arrows and other primitive forms of weapons.

==Re-imagined Shanna, the She-Devil==
The latest series starring a revamped version of the character, a seven-issue mini series called ''Shanna the She-Devil'', was released in 2005 and written and drawn by [[Frank Cho]].  The new Shanna - who has no ties to the original character - is the result of a genetic experiment and has [[superhuman]] strength and agility. The series was originally scheduled for release under Marvel's "mature readers" [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint, but was rescheduled as a general title, with the nudity drawn out by Cho though the violence remains fairly intact. In early 2006 Marvel stated that there are plans to release the original MAX version as a collected edition.
