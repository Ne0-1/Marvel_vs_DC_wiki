'''Captain Atom''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]].  He was created by [[Steve Ditko]] for [[Charlton Comics]], and was later acquired and revised by [[DC Comics]].

==Publishing history==
===Charlton Comics===
The Charlton Comics version of Captain Atom, created by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] in 1960, focused upon the adventures of Captain Allen Adam.  The character's origin posited Adam working in a special experimental rocket when it accidentally launched with him trapped inside.  Entering the upper atmosphere, the rocket exploded and Adam was atomized.  However, he somehow gained superpowers that included the ability to reform his body safely on the ground.  Learning of his other powers, such as flight and the ability to fire powerful blasts, Adam decided to fight the forces of evil as Captain Atom.

He would be outfitted in a red and yellow costume that apparently acted to shield people from his nuclear powers.  When he "powered up", his hair changed to silver-white.  Later, in his own title, he replaced this costume with a liquid-metal outfit that was under his skin, and transformed when he powered up.  Captain Atom's powers were similar to such other nuclear-powered superheroes as [[Gold Key]]'s [[Doctor Solar]] and [[Dell Comics]]' [[Nukla]].

Captain Atom was first published in a series of short stories in the [[anthology]] series ''Space Adventures'' #33 - #40 and #42 (March 1960 - June 1961 and Oct. 1961).  Charlton began reprinting his short adventures in the anthology ''Strange Suspense Stories'' beginning with #75 (June 1965), renaming tht title ''Captain Atom'' with #78 (Dec. 1965) and giving the hero full-length stories and [[supervillain]] antagonists. (Previous stories involved [[Cold War]] anti-Communist missions or dealing with aliens.)  Captain Atom later teamed with the superhero [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]].  The superhero [[Blue Beetle]] starred in the initial backup feature, later replaced by a Nightshade backup series.  

''Captain Atom'' was cancelled with issue #89 (Dec. 1967). In 1975, the unfinished Ditko art for issue #90 was inked by [[John Byrne]] and published in the first two issues of the official Charlton fanzine, ''[[Charlton Bullseye]]'', as the 10-page "Showdown In Sunuria" (writer:  Jon G. Michels) and the 11-page "Two Against Sunuria" (writer: [[Roger Stern]]). Captain Atom next appeared in issue #7 (May 1982) of the new-talent showcase comic also called ''Charlton Bullseye'', in a story by writer Benjamin Smith and artist/co-writer Dan Reed, which for some reason returned him to  his original red-yellow outfit. The character's last pre-DC appearance was in [[AC Comics]]'  one-shot ''Americomics Special'' #1 (Aug. 1983), in a story teaming the Charlton "Action Heroes" Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, Nightshade and [[Question (comics)|The Question]] as the Sentinels of Justice.  This last story had originally been done for Charlton before the company went under.

DC issued a ''Action Heroes Archive Volume 1'' (ISBN 1401203027), reprinting the Captain Atom stories from ''Space Adventures'' and ''Captain Atom'' #78-82.

===DC Comics===
The rights to Captain Atom and most other Charlton characters were purchased by DC Comics in the early 1980s. Originally, these Charlton characters were to be reintroduced in writer [[Alan Moore]]'s [[miniseries]] ''[[Watchmen]]''; however, this was deemed to render the characters unusuable for future stories, and characters inspired by the Charlton originals were used instead. For Captain Atom, the stand-in was [[Doctor Manhattan]].

The actual Charlton characters finally made their re-appearance in the pages of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', which introduced [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-4]] as the native reality of Captain Atom on which he had had all his Charlton era adventures... only to blow it up and erase this "pre-crisis" continuity by series end. 

A new, "post-crisis" version of the character was introduced with the launch in 1986 of a monthly comic written by [[Cary Bates]] (a long-time writer of ''[[The Flash]]'' and ''[[Superman]]'') and drawn by [[Pat Broderick]].  This modern captain's name was established as Nathaniel Christopher Adam, a [[United States Air Force]] soldier in the [[Vietnam War]] framed for a crime he didn't commit and sentenced to death under the watch of Col. Wade Eiling in 1968.  As an alternative to execution, he was invited to participate in a military experiment with little chance of survival.  The experiment involved testing the hull of a crashed alien ship's durability by exploding a [[nuclear bomb]] under it.  Adam survived as the metal melted into his body and the excess energy threw him forward in time nearly twenty years. Not incidentally, this coating with alien metal gave the revised character a full-body silvered metal look distinctly different from his previous incarnations.

Upon arrival and regaining coherence from his experience, Adam found himself a man out of his time, in the hands of Eiling, now a general and the second husband of Adam's now-deceased wife.  After an attempt to kill Adam failed, Eiling settled for assigning Adam as a spy in the superhero community under the code-name "Captain Atom".  The events of the Charlton stories were established as simply the cover story for Adam, who also was assigned the alias of Air Force intelligence operative Cameron Scott.  Atom/Adam served under Eiling reluctantly, while succeeding in clearing his name.  Eventually, Atom rebelled against Eiling completely, resigned from the Air Force and found some fulfillment as an actual superhero.

Becoming a superhero, Captain Atom joined the [[Justice League]] at the request of the U.S. government, serving as leader of [[Justice League Europe]].  In 1991, Atom was slated to become the hero-turned-villain [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] in DC's ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover event; however, when word of this leaked out, DC changed the ending at the last minute, choosing to leave him lost in time and cancelling his ongoing series.

He was briefly shown in flashbacks in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s comic [[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]] as a member of Magog's Justice Battalion, along with the rest of the Charlton "Action Heroes".  His death/detonation at the hands of the villain Parasite, and the irradiation of Kansas this caused, was what made [[Superman]] return to action.  His outfit in this comic was a combination of his original Charlton uniform and his later DC costume.

Back in current continuity, he returned to the League, founding an offshoot team, [[Extreme Justice]].  Later, he was a member of the poorly-received all-Charlton-character group [[The L.A.W.]].  In 2003, he again teamed up with several former members of the JL as the "[[Super Buddies]]" in the humorous [[miniseries]] ''Formerly Known as the Justice League''.

Also in 2003, writer [[Jeph Loeb]] returned Captain Atom to his roots as he went back to work for the government, this time for President [[Lex Luthor]] in the first story arc of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series.  Atom seemingly sacrificed his life to save Superman and Earth, but as readers expected (since it had previously been established that this type of accident could not kill him), he soon returned to life and to the background of the DC Universe.

In 2004, DC launched a miniseries called "[[Breach]]".  Reportedly the series was originally planned as a revamp of the Captain Atom concept, but subsequently was reconceived as a completely new character.

In a 2005 issue of [[Superman/Batman]] it was made clear that Captain Atom survived the collision with the Kryptonite meteor, but after absorbing massive amounts of radiation and becoming a super villain described as a "[[Kryptonite]] Man", the radiation was siphoned out of Captain Atom by a device made by Hiro Okamura (the new [[Toyman]]) which returned Captain Atom to his usual self (if somewhat confused).

===WildStorm Comics===
Captain Atom will now appear in a nine part mini-series ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' under the DC imprint [[WildStorm]]. According to sources, Captain Atom's sacrifice in Superman/Batman sent him to the WildStorm universe for a certain amount of time in which this mini-series will take place.  In this title, he his wearing the yellow/red outfit from the ''Kingdom Come'' series.

*Penciller- [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]]

At the moment of his "death" Captain Atom briefly experiences a time-shift coinciding with his 2005 appearance in Superman/Batman, then makes landfall in the [[WildStorm]] Universe. He quickly gets into a fight with an overzealous [[Mr. Majestic]] and wins. Seeing the fearful reactions of spectators, and puzzling over his own altered appearance, he quickly realizes this is not his Earth.

==Powers==
Captain Atom wields energy powers of all ranges from nuclear to x-ray to heat/light.  He is able to absorb all forms of energy and either boost his own strength and powers or redirect to his enemy.  If Atom absorbs too much energy at once, he is sent hurling through time.  Depending on the type of energy absorbed, he either goes forward or backward in time.

==Other media==
[[Image:Capatom.JPG|Captain Atom (DC version) as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.|thumb]]
The character appears in the [[animated television series]], ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.  In that series, his premise is actually closer to the [[Legion of Super Heroes|Legionnare]] [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]], in that Atom is a disembodied mass of sentient energy that is contained in a special suit.  He serves as a mild antagonistic foil for [[Green Arrow]], in much the same way the [[silver age]] [[Hawkman]] did in the comics; that is, they persue bickering conflict between the military officer and the peace activist, although this type of conflict has not been developed since the pair made peace in their first mission together.  However in later episodes Captain Atom is seen fulfilling the role of an all-around powerhouse with severely conflicted loyalties; examples of this role include controlling a nuclear reactor in (''Task Force X'') then later coerced into fighting [[Superman]] by his superiors in the Air Force who at the time were acting on instructions from [[Project Cadmus]] in (''Question Authority'').  His first appearance (''Initiation'') was voiced by CSI's [[George Eads]] while his later appearances were voiced by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]].
