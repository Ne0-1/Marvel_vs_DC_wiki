'''Captain Atom''' is a fictional [[comic book]] [[superhero]].  Created by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist/co-writer [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''Space Adventures'' #33 ([[1960#March|March 1960]]). Captain Atom was created for [[Charlton Comics]] but was later acquired by [[DC Comics]] and revised for DC’s [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-Crisis]] [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

In both incarnations, the character was a [[United States armed forces|military]] official (scientist '''Allen Adam''' in the Charlton version, [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilot '''Nathaniel Adam''' in the DC version), who was caught in a scientific experiment and “atomized”. He was able to reform his body, and found that he had acquired superhuman strength and endurance, as well as the abilities to fly and to project [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#energy blasts|energy blast]]s.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Captain Atom | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 67  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Throughout the years, the character has been featured in several moderate-to-short lived eponymous series, and has been a member of several different versions of DC’s flagship superhero team [[Justice League]].

==Fictional history and biography==
===Charlton Comics (Silver Age)===
[[Image:StrangeSuspenseStories75.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Reprint issue of first Captain Atom appearance]]

The Charlton Comics version of Captain Atom was '''Allen Adam'''. The character's origin had Adam working in a special experimental rocket when it accidentally launched with him trapped inside. Entering the upper atmosphere, the rocket exploded and Adam was atomized. However, he somehow gained superpowers that included the ability to reform his body safely on the ground. He was outfitted in a red and yellow costume that apparently acted to shield people from his nuclear powers. When he "powered up", his hair changed to silver-white. Later, in his own title, he replaced this costume with a liquid-metal outfit that was under his skin, and transformed when he powered up. Captain Atom's powers were similar to such other nuclear-powered superheroes as [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]]'s [[Solar (comics)|Doctor Solar]] and [[Dell Comics]]' [[Nukla]]. Captain Atom was first published in a series of short stories in the [[anthology]] series ''Space Adventures'' # 33-40 (March 1960-June 1961) and # 42 (October 1961). Charlton began reprinting his short adventures in the anthology ''Strange Suspense Stories'' beginning with #75 (June 1965), renaming the title ''Captain Atom'' with #78 (Dec. 1965) and giving the hero full-length stories and [[supervillain]] antagonists (previous stories involved [[Cold War]] anti-Communist missions or dealing with aliens). Captain Atom later teamed with the superhero [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]].  The superhero [[Blue Beetle]] starred in the initial backup feature, later replaced by a Nightshade backup series.

''Captain Atom'' was canceled with issue #89 (Dec. 1967).  In 1975, the unfinished Ditko art for issue #90 was inked by [[John Byrne]] and published in the first two issues of the official Charlton fanzine, ''[[Charlton Bullseye (fanzine)|Charlton Bullseye]]'', as the 10-page "''Showdown In Sunuria''" (writer:  Jon G. Michels) and the 11-page "Two Against Sunuria" (writer: [[Roger Stern]]). Captain Atom next appeared in issue #7 (May 1982) of the new-talent showcase comic also called ''Charlton Bullseye'', in a story by writer Benjamin Smith and artist/co-writer Dan Reed, which for some reason returned him to his original red-yellow outfit. The character's last pre-DC appearance was in [[AC Comics]]' one-shot ''Americomics Special'' #1 (Aug. 1983), in a story teaming the Charlton "Action Heroes" Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, Nightshade, and [[Question (comics)|The Question]] as the [[Sentinels of Justice]].  This last story had originally been done for Charlton before the company folded.

The actual Charlton characters made their reappearance in the DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', which introduced [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Four]] as the native reality of Captain Atom on which he had had all his Charlton era adventures. By the series end, Earth-Four (and the Charlton characters) was incorporated into the Post-Crisis DC Universe. The last appearance of this Charlton-era Captain Atom was in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #90 (February 1986).

===DC Comics (Post-Crisis)===

A new, post-Crisis version of the character was introduced in 1986 with the launch of a monthly comic written by [[Cary Bates]] (long-time writer of ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' and ''[[Superman]]''), co-written by [[Greg Weisman]] and drawn by [[Pat Broderick]].

This modern captain's name is established as '''Nathaniel Christopher Adam''', a [[United States Air Force]] officer of the [[Vietnam War]] era. Adam has been framed for a crime he didn't commit and sentenced to death under the watch of [[General Wade Eiling|Col. Wade Eiling]] in 1968. As an alternative to execution, he is invited to participate in a military experiment with little chance of survival, in exchange for a presidential pardon. The experiment involves testing the hull of a crashed alien ship's durability by exploding a super [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] under it. Adam survives as the metal melts into his body and the excess energy throws him forward in time 18 years (not incidentally, this coating with alien metal gave the revised character a full-body silvered metal look distinctly different from his previous incarnations).<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]] | Penciller = [[Pat Broderick|Broderick, Pat]] | Inker = Smith, Bob | Story = A Matter of Choice! | Title = Captain Atom | Volume =  | Issue = 11 | Date = January 1988 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

Regaining coherence in 1986, Adam finds himself a man out of his time and in the hands of Eiling, now a general and the second husband of Adam's now-deceased wife. Everyone had assumed that Nathaniel Adam had died on the day of the experiment, so his presidential pardon was never issued and the current government refuses to acknowledge the previous administration's promised pardon. Seizing the opportunity at hand, the government uses the outstanding murder/treason charges against Adam to blackmail him into acting as a government-controlled superhero codenamed Captain Atom. The events of the Charlton stories are established as simply the cover story for Adam, who also is assigned the alias of Cameron Scott, an Air Force intelligence operative. It was during this time he meets the superpowered terrorist, [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]], who becomes a recurring part of Nathaniel's life. Early conflicts involve him coming to terms with his lost time with his children (who are now close to his current age as a result of the time jump), the death of his wife (who, prior to her death, had married his nemesis Eiling), and the overall ramifications of his newly acquired powers.

Atom/Adam serves under Eiling reluctantly, while succeeding in clearing his name. Eventually, Atom rebells against Eiling, resigns from the Air Force, and finds some fulfillment as an actual superhero. Captain Atom joins the [[Justice League]] at the request of the U.S. government, eventually serving as leader of [[Justice League Europe]]. During his career he has a brief romance with  [[Catherine Cobert]], develops a friendly "rivalry" with [[Firestorm (Ronald Raymond)|Firestorm]], becomes involved with and eventually marries Plastique (ironically, a one-time Firestorm foe), battles [[Major Force]] (his would-be successor), learns basic heroics from [[Batman]] when he briefly loses access to the Quantum Field, and commands the metahuman forces during the ''Invasion'' storyline.

In 1991, ''Captain Atom'' was canceled as of #57, as Atom was slated to become the hero-turned-villain [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] in DC's ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover event; however, when word of this leaked out, DC changed the ending at the last minute.  Atom and the Monarch character continue battling through time in ''[[Armageddon: The Alien Agenda]]'' [[limited series]], until he is returned to his own time at the conclusion. Captain Atom then returns to the League, founding an offshoot team, [[Extreme Justice]] in 1995.<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 117  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>  While leading Extreme Justice, Captain Atom comes across another version of Monarch, this one claiming to be the real Nathaniel Adam. Later in 1999, he is a member of the poorly-received all-Charlton-character group [[L.A.W. (comics)|L.A.W.]] In 2003, he again teams up with several former members of the Justice League as the "[[Super Buddies]]" in the humorous [[limited series]] ''Formerly Known as the Justice League''. Around this time, various stories reintroduce Atom's conflict between his role in the superhero community and his responsibilities as a government agent. 

At some point, Atom's marriage to Plastique ends in divorce. Apart from a brief mention of her at the beginning of L.A.W., the marriage appears to be forgotten. Plastique has reappeared in 2006 as a villainess again, undoing her reformation into a heroine. A later confirmation is brought in by the ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' miniseries in which, after falling in love with [[Engineer (comics)|Angela Spica]] of [[The Authority]], Captain Atom reminisces about his short marriage with Plastique, and attributes their divorce to their irreconcilable views about world and politics, since Nathaniel, even in his spousal life, couldn't stop being a loyal soldier of the U.S.A., and Plastique couldn't simply put aside her life as a terrorist.

Later in 2003, writer [[Jeph Loeb]] returns Captain Atom to his roots as he went back to work for the government, this time for President [[Lex Luthor]] in the first story arc of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series. Atom seemingly sacrifices his life to save Superman and Earth by piloting a starship to destroy a kryptonite meteor, but as it had previously been established that this type of accident could not kill him, he soon returnes to life and to the background of the DC Universe. In a 2005 issue of ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' it is made clear that Captain Atom survived the collision with the kryptonite meteor, but has absorbed massive amounts of radiation and become a super villain described as a "[[Kryptonite Man]]."  The radiation is siphoned out of Captain Atom using a device made by [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Hiro Okamura]], the new [[Toyman]], which returns Captain Atom to his usual self (if somewhat confused).

==="Armageddon" and WorldStorm===
In 2005/2006, Captain Atom appears in a nine-part [[limited series]] entitled ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' under DC's [[Wildstorm]] imprint. Captain Atom's sacrifice in ''Superman/Batman'' sends him to the WildStorm universe for the duration of the series. In this title, he wears the yellow/red outfit seen in the ''Kingdom Come'' limited series. 

At the moment of his apparent death, Captain Atom experiences a time-shift coinciding with his 2005 appearance in ''Superman/Batman'', resulting in his arrival in the [[Wildstorm Universe]]. He quickly gets into a fight with an overzealous [[Mister Majestic]] and the fight ends with Majestic soundly defeated. Seeing the frightened reactions of onlookers, and puzzling over his own altered appearance, he realizes that he has somehow become trapped on an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|alternate Earth]], one where superheroes are feared by the general populace. Mistaken by the local superheroes as the force destined to destroy their universe, he is in fact an instrument used ultimately by Nikola Hanssen, new host for half the essence of the [[Void (comics)|Void]], to reclaim her whole power (partially lodged in his own body, and cause of his altered appearance) and use it to trigger the reboot of the WildStorm universe, in the [[Wildstorm Universe#WorldStorm|WorldStorm]] event.
===Monarch===
[[Image:Caultimatum.png|thumb|150px|right|Captain Atom's ultimatum,<br/>art by [[Dan Jurgens]].]]
Captain Atom returns to the DC Universe in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 when [[Superboy-Prime]] punctured his Earth-Eight counterpart [[Breach (comics)|Breach]]. Confusingly, the end of Armageddon has him reappear in the devastated [[Blüdhaven]]. [[One Year Later|A year later]], Captain Atom is revealed to be contained inside [[Blüdhaven]] and used to administer radiation treatments to [[metahuman]]s. Apparently Void, able to finally let him go home, is unable to ensure his safety, and multiple damages to his radiation-shielding skin had left him comatose and unable to keep down his body radiation to safe levels; this forces the [[Atomic Knight#"One Year Later"|Atomic Knights]] to keep him constantly contained. In 2008's ''Countdown'' #8, it is learned that these ruptures were caused as part of a greater plan by Solomon the Monitor, in his plans to "recreate the Monarch" as part of a larger scheme to force the assimilation of the other Monitors.

After being fitted with an updated version of the [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] armor (''[[Armageddon 2001]]'') to contain his radiation, the Captain awakens. Seeming to be mentally unstable, he breaks free, apparently kills the rampaging [[Major Force]], and then releases a vast amount of energy, obliterating what was left of Blüdhaven. He remains missing until [[Kyle Rayner]], then known as [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]], discovers him in [[Bleed (comics)|The Bleed]], a place between dimensions. The Captain indicates that he is traveling through The Bleed in order to operate outside the gaze of the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitors]]. He discusses his time in the Wildstorm Universe, and his desire to visit other alternate worlds.<ref>''Ion'' #10</ref>

====Countdown====
{{main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}
Monarch appears in the last panel of ''Countdown'' #45. He appears to be observing [[Forerunner (comics)|Forerunner]]. ''Countdown'' #44 bears a cover by Ed Benes with the Monarch armor.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=117857 Counting Down with Mike Marts: ''Countdown'' #45]</ref> In the same issue Monarch manages to sway Forerunner to his side, turning her against the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitors]]. Monarch argues that the Monitors are genocidal overlords who must be defeated; however, the Monitors assert that Monarch is a supervillain whose plan is to cause a Multiversal war which will leave him the ruler of the unified Earth remaining in its wake. Monarch creates an army of foot soldiers, including [[Extremists (comics)|the Extremists]] of Earth-8, the JL-Axis of Earth-10, and the [[Crime Syndicate|Crime Society]] of Earth-3, and disposes of Forerunner when he reveals his plans for a multiversal arena tournament. 

The 4-issue miniseries ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' features Monarch battling alternate versions of characters throughout the Multiverse to compile the strike team for his new Multiverse army,<ref name="dc-ency"/> specifically one [[Superman]], one [[Batman]], a [[Wonder Woman]], a [[Green Lantern]], a [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], a [[Blue Beetle]], a [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], a [[Starman (comics)|Starman]], and a [[Ray (comics)|Ray]].[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768]  Monarch's behavior becomes increasingly violent, notably in the form of his killing all residents of the Eve of Shadows' country for attempting to violate the Monarch's rule of "no escaping."<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #1</ref> Monarch is now paranoid, and unwilling to share details of his past to his "subordinates", the ''[[Superman: Red Son|Red Son]]'' Superman and ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files|Liberty Files]]'' Batman are able to discern that under the Monarch armor lies another Captain Atom, so they employ his other counterparts: [[Breach (comics)|Breach (Tim Zanetti)]] and [[Firestorm (comics)#Other versions|Quantum-Storm (Ronnie Raymond)]] to assemble an army of Captain Atoms from the different dimensions to fight back. In the ''Arena'' storyline's conclusion, Monarch reveals that Breach is his brainwashed accomplice and that he has lured his 51 counterparts into his presence in order to murder them and absorb their power. With his team of Eve of Shadows (Earth-13), Vampire Batman ([[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain|Earth-43]]), [[Atom (Ray Palmer)#Other versions|Ray "the Ray" Palmer]] (Earth-6), the monstrous Scarab ([[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!|Earth-26]]), Hal Jordan Jr. ([[Batman Beyond|Earth-12]]), [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Starwoman]] (Earth-7), [[Johnny Quick#52 version|Johnny Quick]] (Earth-3), Wonder Woman ([[Wonder Woman: Amazonia|Earth-34]]), Red Son Superman ([[Superman: Red Son|Earth-30]]), and himself - the sum power of 52 Captain Atoms - Monarch believes he is ready to confront the Monitors,<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #4</ref> and does so, finally launching his war on Earth-51 against the exposed Monitors.<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #17</ref>

In a protracted fight against [[Superboy-Prime|Superman-Prime]], his suit is damaged, releasing a chain reaction that apparently destroys the entire universe of Earth-51 aside from its Monitor.<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #13 (January 2008)</ref> It was later revealed that the Monitor Solomon had attacked Captain Atom in Blüdhaven, rupturing his skin and setting into motion his transformation into Monarch.<ref>''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #8 (March 2008)</ref>

===Project 7734===
Captain Atom returns in co-feature ''Action Comics'' #879 and appears in his normal costume instead of the Monarch armor he was last seen wearing. He is shown at some point in the medieval past or on an alternate Earth that resembles it, attacking a highly fortified castle for unknown reasons other than, as he states, "his mission". After obliterating the castle's defenses, he has a brief flashback to a moment with the Justice League, then falls to the ground disoriented, with a barbarian about to drive a sword into him. No explanation is given for his return to his original appearance, his whereabouts since ''Countdown to Final Crisis'', or why he has reverted back to his heroic persona rather than that of the conquest-seeking Monarch. In ''Action Comics'' #880 it is revealed that Captain Atom has little or no memory of who he is other than his name.

During [[Jimmy Olsen]]'s investigation about ''Project 7734'', the secret black-op commanded by [[Sam Lane]] to fight extraterrestrial menaces on Earth (including [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]ians), it is discovered that an amnesiac and brainwashed Captain Atom is now one of the prized possession of Sam Lane, ''Project Breach'' is his capture and brainwashing into a weapon (with Sam Lane wanting to stress the similarities between Adams and [[Breach (comics)|Tim Zanetti]]) or ''Planet Breaker''. Captain Atom refers to his name and rank as "Codename: Captain Atom". How Captain Atom escaped the facilities of ''Project 7734'' is still unknown.<ref>''Superman's Pal: Jimmy Olsen Special'' #2 (2009)</ref>
Later Captain Atom is attacked by Major Force, an enemy believed to have been destroyed by Atom himself when he first became Monarch.<ref>''Action Comics'' #883</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*Captain Atom's '''Dilustel''' skin is tied into the Quantum Field, which enables him to absorb and manipulate theoretically infinite amounts of energy. The amount he can use is limited by his willpower.  This energy can be used for flight (which is generally faster than the speed of sound in Earth's atmosphere and up to half-light speed in the vacuum of space), super strength (shown at times to be on par with [[Martian Manhunter]]), self sustenance and life support (allowing him to live and even speak in space), and controlling other energy of any form. He commonly manipulates his energy into force field bubbles, or explosive 'bombs', but the most common form is a simple energy blast.   If Atom absorbs too much energy at once, the energy transports him uncontrollably through time. Depending on the type of energy absorbed, he either goes forward or backward in time. 
*Over the years, Captain Atom has become an expert at energy manipulation and he can fire energy blasts from any point on his body, although he usually uses his hands for better aim. He can fire in multiple directions at once or from every point of his body at once. Several times he has "detonated", releasing a massive amount of energy at once, destroying objects within a certain radius. On more than one occasion, he has used his ability to manipulate all forms of energy to prevent a foe using their own powers, such as the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] and [[Firestorm (Ronald Raymond)|Firestorm]]. 
*Captain Atom can also convert energy to matter in the same manner he manipulates energy. Originally, he needed a pair of gloves invented by [[Blue Beetle]] to do so, but he has since learned to do so without them. In the same way, he learned to access [[weak interaction|weak force]] energy. With focus and effort, Captain Atom can increase any of his abilities to match his current willpower.
*As of ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' #4, Captain Atom has demonstrated minor atomic transmutation powers, as he was able to turn both [[Maul (Wildstorm)|Maul]] and [[Engineer (comics)|Engineer]] back to their human forms. This power can be used instinctively or through concentration. He has also shown the ability to telepathically interface with computer networks in addition to those listed above.
*In ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' #7, Captain Atom has shown time-traveling capabilities without quantum jumping. Captain Atom states that through concentration, he can briefly travel ahead in time ("about a week or so"). The process is exhausting and the period he can interact in the future appears to be limited to a few minutes before he returns to the present.
*Recently, writers and editors have introduced a radioactive aspect of Captain Atom's physical makeup. This seems to contradict the quantum nature of Atom's powers as originally introduced, as he previously didn't emit radiation when his skin was cut open. 
*Towards the end of his series' run, it was speculated that Captain Atom is an Elemental (Quantum Elemental) along with [[Swamp Thing]] (Earth), [[Red Tornado]] (Air), [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] (Fire), and [[Naiad (comics)|Naiad]] (Water).
*In addition to his superhuman abilities, Nathaniel Adam is also an experienced [[United States Air Force]] pilot. It is notable that he is one of the few superheroes with a "[[Captain (land)|Captain]]" appellation that corresponds to a military rank he has actually held. He is especially skilled in combat piloting and is also trained in military weaponry, strategy, and hand-to-hand combat. Adam also has strong survival instincts derived from his experiences during the Vietnam War. 
===Dilustel===
Captain Atom's metallic shell, or "skin", is composed of a portion of the alien being known as Silver Shield, and is called Dilustel. Pieces of the alien's metal body were used in [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project Atom|Project Atom]], and on later subjects like [[Major Force]] and [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]]. Nathaniel is able to coat himself with the metal, either partially or totally. Atom's symbiosis with the metal is such that even partially armored he is able to access the Quantum Field. The metal is almost totally indestructible, resistant to various degrees of damage from energy, heat, lasers, etc. Only '''X-Ionizer''' technology can cut the metal, as established when the Captain Atom Project uses it to remove the Silver Shield's skin. The [[katana]] wielded by the "Cambodian" that once sliced through Atom's side was also X-Ionized. The magical guns of the [[Crimson Avenger]] were able to crack his skin. Breaking through it causes Captain Atom to Quantum Jump as if he has absorbed too much energy.

===X-Ionizer===
The X-Ionizer is a molecular hardening technology invented by Doctor Heinrich Megala of [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project Atom|Project Atom]], introduced in the [[Cary Bates]] run of the [[DC Comics]] published ''Captain Atom''. Because of the nearly invulnerable nature of the alien metal discovered, the scientists needed some way to cut it in order to perform experiments. Doctor Heinrich Megala of Project Atom developed a device that would make the molecular lattices of an object knit together in such a way that it became superdense and compact, in effect, making the object nearly indestructible. Also, any edge on an X-Ionized object would attain the sharpness of a [[Monomolecular wire|monofilament edge]], enabling the object to cut finer and cleaner than the most advanced blade or laser. Once transformed, the object would then be able to cut through virtually any material, including the '''Dilustel''' (quantum metal) skin of the ''Silver Shield'' which was used to empower Captain Atom, [[Major Force]], and [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]].<ref>[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=silvershield The Unofficial Silver Shield I Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A mercenary known as the Cambodian wore a suit of X-Ionized armor, and uses an X-ionized [[katana]] to cut through Captain Atom's skin in ''Captain Atom'' #7.<ref>[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=cambodian The Unofficial Cambodian, The Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Other versions ==
===Armageddon 2001===
{{main|Armageddon 2001}}
An alternate future Captain Atom is featured prominently in the 1991 series ''Armageddon 2001''. A tragedy drives him insane and he uses his powers in vengeance. Unfortunately, it also triggers a chain of events which brings [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] to the present 'time'.

===Kingdom Come===
{{main|Kingdom Come (comics)}}
Captain Atom appears briefly in flashback sequences of [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s 1996 graphic novel ''Kingdom Come'', printed under DC Comics' "[[Elseworlds]]" imprint. His death at the hands of the villain [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], and the irradiation of Kansas this caused, results in [[Superman]]'s return to action and sets the events of the story into motion. His outfit in this comic is a combination of his original Charlton uniform and his later DC costume. The ''Kingdom Come'' universe established and created by Waid and Ross would later be introduced to DC canon in the form of Earth-22. The Silver Age Captain Atom appears in the sequel ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom: Planet Krypton]]'' #1 as one of the "ghosts" in the empty "Planet Krypton" restaurant.

===''Dr. Manhattan''===
{{see also|Watchmen}}
The rights to Captain Atom and most other Charlton characters were purchased by DC Comics in the early 1980s.  Originally, these Charlton characters were to be reintroduced in writer [[Alan Moore]]'s [[limited series]] ''Watchmen''; however, this was deemed to render the characters unusable for future stories, and characters inspired by the Charlton originals were used instead.<ref name="Characters2">[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/09moore.html "Alan Moore Interview - Comic Book Artist #9"]  —  An interview with Alan Moore (retrieved 14 April 2006)</ref><ref name="Characters">[http://surbrook.devermore.net/adaptionscomic/watchmen/watchmenintro.html "Watchmen - Introduction"]  —  An overview of the plot and characters in ''Watchmen'' (retrieved 12 March 2006)</ref>  [[Doctor Manhattan]] from ''Watchmen'' resembles Captain Atom in that Dr. Manhattan has similar powers, and like Captain Atom, gained those powers through a similar scientific mishap.<ref name="ISBN">{{cite book | title=Watchmen | publisher=Titan | isbn=1-85286-024-3 | last=Moore | first=Alan | year=2006}}</ref>

===''Breach''===
{{main|Breach (comics)}}
In 2004, DC launched an ongoing series called ''Breach''. The series was originally planned as a revamp of the Captain Atom concept, but Breach was subsequently re-conceived as a completely new character. The 2005 mini-series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' revealed that Breach would have been a native of Earth-Eight if the Multiverse had continued to exist after ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' as his world's counterpart to Captain Atom.<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #5 (Apr 2006) [[DC Comics]]</ref> The 2007 series  ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' at first suggests that a new Breach was created on the Earth-8 of the [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#The 52|new Multiverse]], although whether this indeed happened is called into question when the Breach featured in the miniseries is revealed to be the same mainstream Breach featured in the eponymous limited series. Breach is killed when absorbed into Monarch in the last issue of ''Countdown: Arena.''

===52 Multiverse===
{{main|52 (comics)}}
In the final issue of ''52'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-4". As a result of [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-4, including Captain Atom and the other Charlton characters. The names of the characters are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Captain Atom is visually similar to Charlton's original version of the character.<ref>

2007's ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' features Captain Atoms from alternate universes. The combatants of the series are introduced as a new [[Breach (comics)|Breach]] of Earth-8, a [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]]/Nathaniel Adam fusion called "Quantum-Storm" from Earth-37, and another from Earth-38 who rules over his Atomic Knights. Additionally, issue #1 introduces a "Brigadier Atom" from Earth-13 married to [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], and in ''Countdown: Arena'' #3, Breach gathers together a group of alternate Captain Atoms, including Earth-13's Brigadier, the Captain Atom as depicted in the graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' (Earth-22), and a Captain in a red/silver variant of the Monarch's costume, the classic Charlton Comics Atom (Earth-4), and a [[Hulk (comics)|Hulked out]] variant from an unknown Earth. Several more variants are shown in ''Countdown: Arena'' #4, including a President Atom, a robot called Quantum Mechanix, [[Kid Quantum]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], Captain Adamma, Quantum Boy, an anthropomorphic wolf version, a [[Superman: Red Son|Soviet Atom]] from Earth-30 , a [[Doctor Manhattan]]-lookalike, an energy based-Atom who makes calculations during his attacks, and a giant-sized actual Atom. ''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond 3D'' depicts a Captain Allen Adam from Earth-4, a cross between the original Charlton version and [[Doctor Manhattan]].

Captain Atom appears in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', played by [[George Eads]] in his first appearance and by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]] in all subsequent ones. The JLU version of the character speaks with a slight [[Texas]] accent, and his true identity is "'''Captain Nathaniel Adams'''", a former member of the U.S. Air Force.<br>In this series, Captain Atom is a disembodied mass of energy contained within a special suit, similar to [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Like his comic counterpart, he can manipulate all forms of radiation, but his containment suit can only store a set amount of energy, which, if exceeded, causes him to explode like a nuclear bomb. He serves as a mildly antagonistic political foil for [[Green Arrow]] (who says to Captain Atom, "I think you're what I marched against back in college.") in much the same way the [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)#Silver Age version|Silver Age Hawkman]] did in the comics; that is, the military officer and the former peace activist maintain their political differences through bickering during downtime, although this type of conflict has not been developed since the pair made peace in their first mission together.<br>When "Task Force X" (the series version of the [[Suicide Squad]]) infiltrates the Watchtower, it is when the Captain is one of the few on duty.  Ironically, he is unable to save Plastique from the explosion the Task Force uses to cover their escape. During the Cadmus arc, Captain Atom is briefly turned against the Justice League by his superiors in the U.S. Air Force, who at the time are acting on instructions from [[Project Cadmus]] ("Question Authority"). He challenges Superman in an effort to uphold his orders to keep the [[Question (comics)|Question]] in Cadmus custody, only to be beaten after an extended battle. He returns to the League following this.<br>His appearances throughout the rest of the series are fairly minor. His last appearance is in the finale, where he is seen in the "curtain call" with fellow Ditko creations the Question, the Creeper, Hawk and Dove.

===''Superman/Batman: Public Enemies''===
Captain Atom appears in the animated movie ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]],'' where he is played by [[Xander Berkeley]]. He and the [[Justice League]]&mdash;[[Power Girl]] ([[Allison Mack]]), [[Major Force]] ([[Ricardo Chavira]]), [[Black Lightning]] ([[LeVar Burton]]), [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] ([[Corey Burton]]), [[Hawkman]] ([[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]]), [[Starfire]] ([[Jennifer Hale]]), and [[Katana]]&mdash;are working for President [[Lex Luthor]] ([[Clancy Brown]]). He and The Justice League try to convince Superman ([[Tim Daly]]) to join them, but he refuses to get involved with anyone working for Luthor. Later, Captain Atom and The Justice League defeat the [[Legion of Doom]] and try to arrest Superman and Batman ([[Kevin Conroy]]), for the murder of [[Metallo]] ([[John C. McGinley]]). During the battle, Captain Atom and Major Force defeat Superman. Just as Major Force is about to kill Superman, Captain Atom stops him. Superman defeated Captain Atom and Major Force as well as the entire Justice League. After knocking out the Justice League, he escapes with Power girl and Batman. Later, Luthor berates Captain Atom for failing and orders him to finish the job. The Justice League find Batman, Superman and Power Girl and fight them again. Just as Superman defeats Captain Atom, Captain Atom sneaks away and overhears an argument between Batman and Major Force. While listening to the argument, he learns from Batman that Luthor had Major Force kill Metallo to frame Superman. Realizing the truth, he changes sides and destroys Major Force after Power Girl and the Justice League weaken him; however in the process, Captain Atom is struck with sufficient force to send him into a coma. After Batman destroys the Kryptonite meteor that was heading for Earth, Superman defeats Luthor, who is then taken into custody by Captain Atom and the Justice League.<ref>[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=502 The World's Finest]</ref>
