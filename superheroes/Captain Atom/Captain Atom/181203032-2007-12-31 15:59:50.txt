'''Captain Atom''' is a fictional [[comic book]] [[superhero]].  Created by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist/co-writer [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''Space Adventures'' #33 ([[1960#March|March 1960]]). Captain Atom was created for [[Charlton Comics]] but was later acquired by [[DC Comics]] and revised for DC’s [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-Crisis]] [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

In both incarnations, the character was a [[Military of the United States|military]] official&mdash;scientist '''Allen Adam''' in the Charlton version, [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilot '''Nathaniel Adam''' in the DC version&mdash;who was caught in a scientific experiment and “atomized.” He was able to reform his body, and found that he had acquired superhuman strength and endurance, the ability to fly, and to project [[energy blast]]s. 

Throughout the years, the character has been featured in several moderate-to-short lived eponymous series, and has been a member of DC’s all-star [[Justice League]].

==Fictional history and biography==
===Charlton Comics (Silver Age)===
[[Image:StrangeSuspenseStories75.jpg|180px|left|thumb|First Captain Atom appearance]]

The Charlton Comics version of Captain Atom was Allen Adam. The character's origin had Adam working in a special experimental rocket when it accidentally launched with him trapped inside. Entering the upper atmosphere, the rocket exploded and Adam was atomized. However, he somehow gained superpowers that included the ability to reform his body safely on the ground. He was outfitted in a red and yellow costume that apparently acted to shield people from his nuclear powers. When he "powered up", his hair changed to silver-white. Later, in his own title, he replaced this costume with a liquid-metal outfit that was under his skin, and transformed when he powered up. Captain Atom's powers were similar to such other nuclear-powered superheroes as [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]]'s [[Doctor Solar]] and [[Dell Comics]]' [[Nukla]].{{or|date=December 2007}} Captain Atom was first published in a series of short stories in the [[anthology]] series ''[[Space Adventures (comics)|Space Adventures]]'' # 33-40 (March 1960-June 1961) and # 42 (October 1961). Charlton began reprinting his short adventures in the anthology ''[[Strange Suspense Stories]]'' beginning with #75 (June 1965), renaming the title ''Captain Atom'' with #78 (Dec. 1965) and giving the hero full-length stories and [[supervillain]] antagonists (previous stories involved [[Cold War]] anti-Communist missions or dealing with aliens.) Captain Atom later teamed with the superhero [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]].  The superhero [[Blue Beetle]] starred in the initial backup feature, later replaced by a Nightshade backup series.

''Captain Atom'' was cancelled with issue #89 (Dec. 1967).  In 1975, the unfinished Ditko art for issue #90 was inked by [[John Byrne]] and published in the first two issues of the official Charlton fanzine, ''[[Charlton Bullseye (fanzine)|Charlton Bullseye]]'', as the 10-page "Showdown In Sunuria" (writer:  Jon G. Michels) and the 11-page "Two Against Sunuria" (writer: [[Roger Stern]]). Captain Atom next appeared in issue #7 (May 1982) of the new-talent showcase comic also called ''Charlton Bullseye'', in a story by writer Benjamin Smith and artist/co-writer Dan Reed, which for some reason returned him to his original red-yellow outfit. The character's last pre-DC appearance was in [[AC Comics]]' one-shot ''Americomics Special'' #1 (Aug. 1983), in a story teaming the Charlton "Action Heroes" Blue Beetle, Captain Atom, Nightshade and [[Question (comics)|The Question]] as the [[Sentinels of Justice]].  This last story had originally been done for Charlton before the company folded.

The actual Charlton characters made their re-appearance in the DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', which introduced [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Four]] as the native reality of Captain Atom on which he had had all his Charlton era adventures. By the series end, Earth-Four (and the Charlton characters) was incorporated into the Post-Crisis DC Universe. The last appearance of this Charlton-era Captain Atom was in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #90 (February 1986).

===DC Comics (Post-Crisis)===
[[Image:Captain Atom 01.jpg|thumb|180px|Cover to Captain Atom #1, written by [[Cary Bates]] & art by [[Pat Broderick]].]]

A new, post-Crisis version of the character was introduced in 1986 with the launch of a monthly comic written by [[Cary Bates]] (long-time writer of ''[[The Flash]]'' and ''[[Superman]]''), co-written by [[Greg Weisman]] and drawn by [[Pat Broderick]].

This modern captain's name was established as Nathaniel Christopher Adam, a [[United States Air Force]] officer of the [[Vietnam War]] era. Adam had been framed for a crime he didn't commit and sentenced to death under the watch of [[General Wade Eiling|Col. Wade Eiling]] in 1968. As an alternative to execution, he was invited to participate in a military experiment with little chance of survival, in exchange for a presidential pardon. The experiment involved testing the hull of a crashed alien ship's durability by exploding a super [[nuclear bomb]] under it. Adam survived as the metal melted into his body and the excess energy threw him forward in time nearly twenty years (not incidentally, this coating with alien metal gave the revised character a full-body silvered metal look distinctly different from his previous incarnations.)

Regaining coherence in 1986, Adam found himself a man out of his time and in the hands of Eiling, now a general and the second husband of Adam's now-deceased wife. Everyone had assumed that Nathaniel Adam had died on the day of the experiment, so his presidential pardon was never issued and the current government refused to acknowledge the previous administration's promised pardon. Seizing the opportunity at hand, the government used the outstanding murder/treason charges against Adam to blackmail him into being a government-controlled superhero codenamed Captain Atom. The events of the Charlton stories were established as simply the cover story for Adam, who also was assigned the alias of Cameron Scott, an Air Force intelligence operative. It was during this time he met the superpowered terrorist, [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]], who would become a recurring part of Nathaniel's life.

Upon his initial return from the Quantum Field, Nathaniel Adam was portrayed as the classic "man out of his time". Early conflicts involved him coming to terms with his lost time with his children (who were now close to his current age as a result of the time jump), the death of his wife (who had married his nemesis Eiling prior to dying), and the overall ramifications of his newly acquired powers.

Atom/Adam served under Eiling reluctantly, while succeeding in clearing his name. Eventually, Atom rebelled against Eiling, resigned from the Air Force and found some fulfillment as an actual superhero. Captain Atom joined the [[Justice League]] at the request of the U.S. government, eventually serving as leader of [[Justice League Europe]]. During his career he had a brief romance with  [[Catherine Cobert]], developed a friendly "rivalry" with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], become involved with and eventually married to Plastique (ironically, a one-time Firestorm foe), battled [[Major Force]] (his would-be successor), learned basic heroics from [[Batman]] when he briefly lost access to the Quantum Field, and commanded the metahuman forces during the ''Invasion'' storyline.

In 1991, ''Captain Atom'' was cancelled with #57, as Atom was slated to become the hero-turned-villain [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] in DC's ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover event; however, when word of this leaked out, DC changed the ending at the last minute.  Atom and the Monarch character continued battling through time in ''[[Armageddon The Alien Agenda|Armageddon: The Alien Agenda]]'' [[limited series]], until he was returned to his own time at the conclusion. Captain Atom then returned to the League, founding an offshoot team, [[Extreme Justice]] in 1995. Whilst leading Extreme Justice, Captain Atom came across another version of Monarch, this one claiming to be the real Nathaniel Adam. Later in 1999, he was a member of the poorly-received all-Charlton-character group [[L.A.W. (comics)|L.A.W.]]. In 2003, he again teamed up with several former members of the Justice League as the "[[Super Buddies]]" in the humorous [[limited series]] ''Formerly Known as the Justice League''. Around this time various stories reintroduced Atom's conflict between his role in the superhero community and his responsibilities as a government agent. 

At some point, Atom's marriage to Plastique appears to have ended in separation or divorce. Apart from a brief mention of her at the beginning of L.A.W., the marriage appears to be forgotten. Plastique has reappeared in 2006 as a villainess again, undoing her reformation into a heroine.

Later in 2003, writer [[Jeph Loeb]] returned Captain Atom to his roots as he went back to work for the government, this time for President [[Lex Luthor]] in the first story arc of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series. Atom seemingly sacrificed his life to save Superman and Earth by piloting a starship to destroy a kryptonite meteor, but as it had previously been established that this type of accident could not kill him, he soon returned to life and to the background of the DC Universe. In a 2005 issue of ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' it was made clear that Captain Atom survived the collision with the kryptonite meteor, but after absorbing massive amounts of radiation and becoming a super villain described as a "[[Kryptonite Man]]", the radiation was siphoned out of Captain Atom by a device made by Hiro Okamura (the new [[Toyman]]) which returned Captain Atom to his usual self (if somewhat confused).

==="Armageddon" and WorldStorm===
In 2005/2006, Captain Atom appeared in a nine-part [[limited series]] entitled ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' under DC's [[Wildstorm]] imprint. Captain Atom's sacrifice in ''Superman/Batman'' sent him to the WildStorm universe for a certain amount of time in which this series took place. In this title, he wore the yellow/red outfit seen in the ''Kingdom Come'' limited series. 

At the moment of his apparent death, Captain Atom experienced a time-shift coinciding with his 2005 appearance in ''Superman/Batman'', resulting in his arrival in the [[Wildstorm Universe]]. He quickly gets into a fight with an overzealous [[Mr. Majestic]] and the fight ended with Majestic soundly defeated. Seeing the frightened reactions of onlookers, and puzzling over his own altered appearance, he realizes that he has somehow become trapped on an [[DC Comics Multiverse|alternate Earth]], one where superheroes are feared by the general populace. Mistaken by the local super-heroes as the force destined to destroy their universe, he was in fact an instrument used ultimately by Nikola Hanssen, new host for half the essence of the [[Void (comics)|Void]], to reclaim her whole power (partially lodged in his own body, and cause of his altered appearance) and use it to trigger the reboot of the WildStorm universe, in the [[WorldStorm]] event.

[[Image:Caultimatum.png|thumb|150px|right|Captain Atom's ultimatum,<br/>art by [[Dan Jurgens]].]]
Captain Atom was returned to the DC Universe in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 when [[Superboy-Prime]] punctured his Earth-Eight counterpart [[Breach (comics)|Breach]]. [[One Year Later]], Captain Atom is revealed to be contained inside [[Blüdhaven]] and used to administer radiation treatments to metahumans. Apparently Void, able to finally let him go home, was unable to ensure his safety, and multiple damages on his radiation-shielding skin had left him comatose and unable to keep down his body radiations to safe levels, forcing the [[Atomic Knight#One Year Later|Atomic Knights]] to keep him constantly contained.

After being fitted with an updated version of the [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] armor (''[[Armageddon 2001]]'') to contain his radiation, the Captain awakens. Seeming to be mentally unstable, he breaks free, apparently kills the rampaging [[Major Force]], and then releases a vast amount of energy, obliterating what was left of Blüdhaven. He remains missing until [[Kyle Rayner]], then known as [[Ion (comics)]], discovers him in The Bleed, a place between dimensions. The Captain indicates that he is travelling through The Bleed in order to operate outside the gaze of the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitors]]. He discusses his time in the Wildstorm Universe, and his desire to visit other alternate worlds.<ref>''Ion'' #10</ref>

===Countdown===
{{main|Countdown (DC Comics)}}
Monarch appears in the last panel of Countdown #45. He appears to be observing [[Forerunner (comics)|Forerunner]]. In his weekly interview on ''Newsarama.com'', Mike Marts revealed that ''Countdown'' #44 bears a cover by Ed Benes with the Monarch armor. <ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=117857 Counting Down with Mike Marts: Countdown #45]</ref>, as in the same issue Monarch manages to sway Forerunner to his side, turning her against the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitors]]. Monarch argues that the Monitors are genocidal overlords who must be defeated, however the Monitors suppose that Monarch is a supervillain whose plan is to cause a Multiversal war which will leave him the ruler of the unified Earth remaining in its wake. Monarch creates an army of footsoldiers, including [[Extremists (comics)|the Extremists]] of Earth-8 and the [[Crime Syndicate|Crime Society]] of Earth-3, and disposes of Forerunner when he reveals his plans for a Multiversal arena tournament. 

The 4-issue miniseries ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' features Monarch battling alternate versions of characters throughout the Multiverse to compile the strike team for his new Multiverse army, specifically one [[Superman]], one [[Batman]], a [[Wonder Woman]], a [[Green Lantern]], a [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], a [[Blue Beetle]], a [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], a [[Starman]], and a [[Ray (comics)|Ray]].[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124768] Even if Monarch is now paranoid, and unwilling to share details of his past to his "subordinates", the ''[[Superman: Red Son|Red Son]]'' Superman and ''[[JSA: The Liberty Files|Liberty Files]]'' Batman are able to discern that under the Monarch armor lies another Capitan Atom, so employs his other counterparts: [[Breach (comics)|Breach (Tim Zanetti)]] and [[Firestorm (comics)#Other versions|Quantum-Storm (Ronnie Raymond)]] to assembly an army of Capitan Atom from the different dimensions to fight back. In the ''Arena'' storyline's conclusion, Monarch reveals that Breach is in his brainwashed accomplice and he has lured his 51 counterparts into his presence in order to murder them and asborb their power. With his team of Eve of Shadows (Earth-13), Vampire Batman ([[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain|Earth-43]]), [[Atom (Ray Palmer)#Other versions|Ray "the Ray" Palmer]] (Earth-6), the monstrous Scarab ([[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!|Earth-26]]), Hal Jordan Jr. ([[Batman Beyond|Earth-12]]), [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Starwoman]] (Earth-7), [[Johnny Quick#52 version|Johnny Quick]] (Earth-3), Wonder Woman ([[Wonder Woman: Amazonia|Earth-34]]) Red Son Superman (Earth-30) and himself - the sum power of 52 Captain Atoms - Monarch believes he is ready to confront the Monitors.

==Powers and abilities==
{{Articleissues|OR=December 2007|long=December 2007|refimprove=December 2007}}
*Captain Atom's metallic shell, or "skin", is composed of a portion of the alien being known as [[Silver Shield]], and is called [[Dilustel]]. Pieces of the alien's metal body were used in [[List of government agencies in comics#Project Atom|Project Atom]], and on later subjects like [[Major Force]] and [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]]. Nathaniel is able to coat himself with the metal, either partially or totally.  Atom's symbiosis with the metal is such that even partially armored he is able to access the Quantum Field. The metal is almost totally indestructible, resistant to various degrees of damage from energy, physical, heat, lasers, etc. Only [[X-Ionizer]] technology can cut the metal because that is what the Captain Atom Project used to remove the ''Silver Shield's'' skin. The [[katana]] wielded by the "Cambodian" that once sliced through Atom's side was also X-Ionized. The magical guns of the [[Crimson Avenger]] were able to crack his skin. Breaking through it causes Captain Atom to Quantum Jump as if he had absorbed too much energy.
*Captain Atom's Dilustel skin is tied into the Quantum Field, which enables him to absorb and manipulate theoretically infinite amounts of energy, the amount of which he can use is, of course, limited by his will power.  If Atom absorbs too much energy at once, he is sent hurling through time.  Depending on the type of energy absorbed, he either goes forward or backward in time.  This energy can be used for flight (which is generally faster than the speed of sound in Earth's atmosphere and up to half-light speed in the vacuum of space), super strength (shown at times to be on par with [[Superman]] or [[Martian Manhunter]]), self sustenance and life support allowing him to live and even speak in space, fire and control energy of any form.  He commonly manipulates his energy into force field bubbles, or explosive 'bombs', but the most common form is a simple blast.
*Over the years, Captain Atom has become an expert at his energy manipulation and he can fire from any point on his body, although he usually uses his hands for ease of aiming. He can fire in multiple directions at once or from every point of his body at once.  Several times he has "detonated", releasing a massive amount of energy at once, destroying objects within a certain radius. Most recently, he used this ability to destroy the city of [[Blüdhaven]].  On more than one occasion, he has used his ability to manipulate all forms of energy to prevent a foe using their own powers, such as the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. 
*Captain Atom can also create matter in the same manner he creates energy.  Originally, he needed a pair of gloves invented by [[Blue Beetle]] to do so, but he later learned to do so without them.  In the same way, he learned to access [[weak force]] energy.  With focus and effort, Captain Atom can increase any of his abilities to the match the amount of will power he uses to gain it.
*As of ''Captain Atom: Armageddon'' #4, Captain Atom has demonstrated minor atomic transmutation powers, as he was able to turn both [[Maul (Wildstorm)|Maul]] and [[Engineer (comics)|Engineer]] back to their human forms.  This power can be used instinctively or through concentration.  He has also shown the ability to telepathically interface with computer networks in addition to those listed above.
*In ''Captain Atom: Armageddon #7'', Captain Atom has shown time-travelling capabilities without quantum jumping.  Captain Atom states that through concentration, he can briefly travel ahead in time ("about a week or so").  The process is exhausting and the period he can interact in the future appears to be limited to a few minutes before he returns to the present.
*Recently, writers and editors have introduced a radioactive aspect of Captain Atom's physical makeup. This seems to contradict the quantum nature of Atom's powers as originally introduced as he didn't emit radiation when his skin was cut open. 
*Towards the end of his series' run, Captain Atom was speculated as being an Elemental (Quantum Elemental) along with [[Swamp Thing]] (Earth), [[Red Tornado]] (Air), [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] (Fire), and [[Naiad (comics)|Naiad]] (Water).
*In addition to his superhuman abilities, Nathaniel Adam is also an experienced [[United States Air Force]] pilot. It is notable that he is one of the few superheroes with a "[[Captain (army/air force)|Captain]]" appellation that corresponds to a military rank he has actually held. He is especially skilled in combat piloting and is also trained in military weaponry, strategy, and hand-to-hand combat. Adam also has strong survival instincts derived from his experiences during the Vietnam War.  
*'''X-Ionizer''' is a molecular hardening technology invented by Doctor Heinrich Megala of [[List of government agencies in comics#Project Atom|Project Atom]], introduced in the [[Cary Bates]] run of the [[DC Comics]] published ''[[Captain Atom]]''. 

Because of the highly invulnerable nature of the alien metal discovered, the scientists needed some way to cut it in order to perform experiments. Doctor Heinrich Megala of Project Atom developed a device that would make the molecular lattices of an object knit together in such a way that it became superdense and compact, in effect, making the object nearly indestructible. Also, any edge on an X-Ionized object would attain the sharpness of a [[Monofilament (science fiction)|monofilament edge]], enabling the object to cut finer and cleaner that the most advanced blade or laser. Once transformed, the object would then be able to cut through virtually any material, including the '''Dilustel''' (quantum metal) skin of the ''Silver Shield'' which was used to empower [[Captain Atom]], [[Major Force]] and [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]].<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=silvershield</ref> 

A mercenary known as the Cambodian wore a suit of X-Ionized armor, and uses an X-ionized [[katana]] to cut through Captain Atom's skin in ''Captain Atom'' #7.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=cambodian</ref>

== Alternate versions ==
===''Watchmen''===
The rights to Captain Atom and most other Charlton characters were purchased by DC Comics in the early 1980s.  Originally, these Charlton characters were to be reintroduced in writer [[Alan Moore]]'s [[limited series]] ''[[Watchmen]]''; however, this was deemed to render the characters unusable for future stories, and characters inspired by the Charlton originals were used instead. For Captain Atom, the stand-in was [[Doctor Manhattan]].

===''Breach''===
In 2004, DC launched an ongoing series called ''[[Breach (comics)|Breach]]''. The series was originally planned as a revamp of the Captain Atom concept, but was subsequently reconceived as a completely new character. The 2005 series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' would indicate that Breach would have been a native of Earth-Eight if the Multiverse continued to exist after ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' as his world's counterpart to Captain Atom.<ref>''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #5 (Apr 2006) [[DC Comics]]</ref> Following the creation of a new "[[List of DC Multiverse worlds#The 52|52 Multiverse]]", a new Breach is shown to exist on a new Earth-8 in the 2007 series ''[[Countdown: Arena]]''

===52 Multiverse===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-4". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-4, including Captain Atom and the other Charlton characters. The names of the characters are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, the Captain Atom is visually similar to Charlton's original version of the character.<ref>

2007's ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' would later heavily feature the Captain Atom of the 51 other alternate universes. The combatants of the series are introduced as a new [[Breach (comics)|Breach]] of Earth-8, a [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]]/Nathaniel Adam fusion called "Quantum-Storm" from Earth-37, and another from Earth-38 who rules over his Atomic Knights. Additionally, issue #1 introduces a "Brigadier Atom" from Earth-13 married to [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], and in ''Countdown: Arena'' #3, Breach gathers together a group of alternate Captain Atoms, including Earth-13's Brigadier, the Captain Atom as depicted in the graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' (Earth-22), and a Captain in a red/silver variant of the Monarch's costume, the classic Charlton Comics Atom (Earth-4), and a [[Hulk (comics)|Hulked out]] variant from an unknown Earth. Several more variants are shown in ''Countdown: Arena'' #4, including a President Atom, a robot called Quantum Mechanix, Captain Adamma, Quantum Boy, an anthropomorphised wolf version, a [[Superman: Red Son|Soviet Atom]], a [[Doctor Manhattan]]-lookalike, an energy based-Atom who makes calculations during his attacks, and a giant-sized actual Atom.

===Other storylines and Elseworlds===
An alternate future [[Captain Atom]] is featured prominently in the 1991 series ''[[Armageddon 2001]]''. A tragedy drives him insane and he uses his powers in venegeance. Unfortunately it also triggers a chain of events which brings [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] to the present 'time'.

Captain Atom appears briefly in flashback sequences of [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s 1996 graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', printed under DC Comics' "[[Elseworlds]]" imprint. His death at the hands of the villain [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], and the irradiation of Kansas this caused, was what made [[Superman]] return to action and sets the events of the story into motion. His outfit in this comic was a combination of his original Charlton uniform and his later DC costume. The ''Kingdom Come'' universe established created Waid and Ross would later be introduced to DC canon in the form of Earth-22 of the 52 Multiverse.

February 1988 would introduce the character of [[Major Force]], a villainous parallel and foil of Captain Atom who receives a similar treatment to the one which gives Nathaniel Adam his abilities. The character would go on to become an ongoing antagonist for Captain Atom. The 2006 ''[[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' One Year Later storyline would introduce a new character called [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]], a teenage girl whose patterned on Captain Atom and given a similar origin story and abilities. The character would eventually turn out to be a villain and an eventual member of the supervillain team "[[Titans East]]". The character's appearances were short-lived, being murdered by [[Batgirl (Cassandra Cain)|Batgirl]] several issues later.

==Other media==
[[Image:Capatom.JPG|thumb|right|Captain Atom (DC version) as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]

The character appeared in the [[animated television series]], ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.  In that series, his premise is closer to that of [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]] of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]], in that Atom is a disembodied mass of sentient energy contained in a special suit. He serves as a mild antagonistic political foil for [[Green Arrow]] in much the same way the [[Silver Age]] [[Hawkman]] did in the comics; that is, they pursue bickering conflict between the military officer and the former peace activist, although this type of conflict has not been developed since the pair made peace in their first mission together. 

In later episodes, Captain Atom is seen fulfilling the role of an all-around powerhouse with severely conflicted loyalties; examples of this role include controlling a nuclear reactor ("Task Force X"), then later being coerced into fighting [[Superman]] by his superiors in the U.S. Air Force, who at the time were acting on instructions from [[Project Cadmus]] ("Question Authority").  In his first appearance ("[[Initiation (Justice League Unlimited)|Initiation]]") he was voiced by ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'''s [[George Eads]] while his later appearances were voiced by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]].  The JLU version of the character speaks with a slight [[Texas]] accent, and whose true identity is "Captain Nathaniel Adam".
