'''Styx and Stone''' are a crinimal duo that have crossed [[Spider-Man]]'s path on a number of occasions.

Hired by Johathon Caesar (issue 309 [[Amazing Spider-Man]]) and reappering in issues 332 - 333 and again in 376 -377.

Styx is the older of the due and has the ability to cause anything organic he touches to decay (he touched Venom once and almost killed the symboite). Stone on the other hand is a high tech mercinary and a beef cake to boot.
