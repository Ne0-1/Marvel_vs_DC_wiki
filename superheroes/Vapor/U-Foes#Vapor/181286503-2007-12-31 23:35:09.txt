'''U-Foes''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] supervillain team. The group first appeared in ''Incredible Hulk'' (1st series) #254 (December 1980). As noted on the first page of that issue, the group's name was inspired by the 1979 [[Graham Parker]] song "Waiting for the UFOs".{{verify source|date=August 2007}}

==Fictional team biography==
They gained their superpowers by taking a cue from the [[Fantastic Four]] and going up into outer space, and getting hit by cosmic rays.  They were a frequent threat to the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] due to Bruce Banner having brought their ship down while it was exposed to the rays, as they believe they could have gained more power without Banner's interference. (Ironically, in their first battle, they are defeated when they lose control of their own newly-gained powers.)  After several defeats at the hands of the Hulk and his allies, each of the U-Foes was banished to a different dimension.  They managed to reunite and find their way back to Earth when the mutant [[Portal (comics)|Portal]]'s powers began manifesting.  The U-Foes attempted to murder Portal to keep him from opening another portal to banish them, until they were defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  They would later attempt to kidnap Portal to exploit his mutant powers, and were defeated once again by [[Captain America]], [[Darkhawk]], and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].

Throughout the [[1980s]] - [[1990s]] the team generally worked alone, but occasionally were hired hands for other villains such as the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. They attacked the independent group, the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], injuring dozens of civilians.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397</ref> They were under the command of the Leader who wanted to get at the commander of the Pantheon itself. Despite the handicap of an orphan girl who had gotten mixed up in the battle, the Hulk and the Pantheon soldiers manage to subdue some of the U-Foes. The villains were tricked into hurting each other. Vapor, particularly, was defeated when she bragged ahead of time what form of gas she was taking and the Hulk and a Pantheon member used this against her. During the Acts of Vengeance, the U-Foes faced the West Coast Avengers with the help of the Mole Man, but they are defeated.

They would later again encounter the Hulk in the Arctic ice fields outside the Leader's devastated sanctuary for cancer victims. The Hulk, having seemingly just lost a friend, scared them off with his anger.

Both of these fights with the Hulk were part of manipulations by the Pantheon's ancient leader, [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]]. Neither side realized the old man was secretly a power-crazed murderous psychotic who enjoys manipulation.

Later, the U-Foes are responsible for the destruction of the supervillain prison called the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. This takes place during a massive breakout.

===Civil War===

The [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], which was part of the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] incident, brings the U-Foes to the attention of the United States government. The U.S. sends the B-Squad version of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], which included the villain [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]] and the U-Foes were arrested. They were given the choice of joining up with the team or facing jail time.

The U-Foes are among the villains recruited to join [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate. <ref>''New Avengers'' #32 - 37 (2007)</ref>
