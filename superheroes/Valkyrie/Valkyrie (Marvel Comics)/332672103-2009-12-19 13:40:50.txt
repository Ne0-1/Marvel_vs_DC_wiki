'''Valkyrie''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. An [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] demi-goddess by birth, her real name is Brunnhilde. Among her other aliases are Barbara Denton-Norriss, Samantha Parrington and Sian Bowen who all were host bodies to the spirit of Brunnhilde. Her first appearance was in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 1 #83. For much of her history she was a mainstay of superhero team known as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Samantha Parrington, a previous host to Brunnhilde, later received the Valkyrie powers herself and became a member of the Defenders as Valkyrie.

===Fictional character biography===
Valkyrie is the strongest of all Valkyrior. Like all her people, her tissue and bone are several times as dense as the mortal equivalent. Though she is not immortal, she ages far more slowly than humans. Valkyrie is immune to all terrestrial diseases and is resistant to most forms of injury. Her Asgardian physiology grants her superhuman levels of stamina. Valkyrie can perceive the approach of death, in the form of a "deathglow" surrounding a person's body. She doesn't know how death will come but she can tell that it is imminent. Valkyrie can transport herself and a dying or dead body to and from the realm of the dead by willing it. Valkyrie has had extensive training in sword fighting as well as unarmed combat and horseback riding. Her natural fighting ability is among the best of all Asgardian females, matched only by [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]].

Brunnhilde was selected by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], King of the Gods of the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], to lead the [[Valkyrior (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrior]] (the Choosers of the Slain), a group of warrior goddesses who would appear over the battlefields of mortal worshippers of the Asgardian gods and choose which of the fallen were worthy to be taken to [[Asgard (comics)#Valhalla|Valhalla]], the land of the honored dead. Brunnhilde served capably in this capacity for centuries.

According to a sentient, disembodied eye that claimed to have once belonged to Odin, the Asgardian monarch once gave his son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] the mortal identity of the warrior [[Siegmund (comics)|Siegmund]]. Circumstances forced Odin to decree that Siegmund must be slain. Brunnhilde, recognizing that Odin was acting against his true wishes, sought to protect Siegmund, but [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] himself then caused Siegmund's death. Brunnhilde helped Siegmund's pregnant lover, [[Sieglinde (comics)|Sieglinde]] get to safety. As punishment for her defiance, Odin removed Brunnhilde's Asgardian powers and immortality and cast her into a trance. She was eventually awakened by [[Siegfried (comics)|Siegfried]], the son of Siegmund and Sieglinde and another mortal incarnation of Thor. 

Brunnhilde and Siegfried became lovers.  However, Siegfried fell under the influence of magic and betrayed her. He was later murdered, and Brunnhilde, still in love with him, leapt into his blazing funeral [[pyre]]. (This part of her background was based on the [[Volsunga saga]].) Odin restored both of them to life, restoring their Asgardian roles and powers, but removing their memories of their earthly lives. (It is unclear how much truth, if any, there is to this account by the eye.)

Brunnhilde and her fellow Valkyries continued to gather heroic mortal warriors for Valhalla until roughly a millennium ago, when Odin was forced to cease virtually all intercourse with the Earth in accordance with a pact that he and the leaders of Earth's other pantheons of gods made with extraterrestrial [[Celestials]]. From then onward, the Valkyries could only choose slain heroes from among fallen Asgardian warriors. Brunnhilde was bitter over being barred from choosing warriors on Earth and roamed Asgard in pursuit of something meaningful to do.

In a tavern on the outskirts of [[Marmoragard]], Brunnhilde encountered [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora the Enchantress]], who offered her a life of adventure. For several weeks Brunnhilde accompanied the Enchantress on her conquests. Brunnhilde soon discovered Amora's immoral nature and tried to end their partnership. In response the Enchantress trapped Brunnhilde within a mystic crystal of souls. While Brunnhilde's body remained in suspended animation, her immortal soul became Amora's plaything. Over the centuries the Enchantress used Brunnhilde's spiritual essence to give the Valkyrie’s powers to herself or to her pawns. The Enchantress usually used her magic to alter the recipient's appearance to resemble Brunnhilde herself.

Specific instances of Amora's exploitation of the Valkyrie before recent years are not yet known. The first time the Enchantress assumed the Valkyrie's physical aspect in recent years was in a plot to lead a handful of female superhumans against the male [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as the [[Lady Liberators (comics)|Lady Liberators]]. Her true identity was discovered, however, and her plan thwarted. Months later, the Enchantress bestowed the Valkyrie's power upon a socialite named Samantha Parrington in an attempt to get revenge on [[the Hulk]].

Finally, a woman driven mad by being trapped in another mystical dimension, Barbara Norriss, was given the Valkyrie's power and consciousness by the Enchantress to help her then-allies, the group of superhumans called the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], escape from the clutches of the sorceress [[Casiolena]]. Amora did not undo her spell on Norriss after Casiolena's defeat. As a result, Norriss's body now possessed Brunnhilda's consciousness, appearance, and powers, while Norriss' own mental essence was trapped in Brunnhilde's real body in Asgard. However, thanks to partial amnesia induced by the Enchantress, Brunnhilde was unaware that she was not in possession of her real body and full memory. Indeed, while trapped in Norriss' body, Brunnhilde's personality lacked much of its usual strength of will.

It was not until a minor Asgardian warrior named [[Ollerus]] attempted to take over Valhalla that the Valkyrie’s two mixed aspects met for the first time. Brunnhilde’s mental essence trapped in Norriss’s transformed body, fought Norriss’ mental essence trapped in Brunnhilde’s real body. At the end of that encounter, the Valkyrie’s body, still possessed by Norriss’ mind, was consigned to Niffleheim, the realm inhabited by the spirits of the non-heroic Asgardian dead, while Brunnhilde’s mind in Norriss’ transformed body accompanied the Defenders, who had made the other dimensional journey with her, back to Earth.

For reasons yet unknown, Brunnhilde was not concerned at this time about reuniting her mind with her true body. It was not until Barbara Norriss’ body was murdered that the Valkyrie's spirit and mind were inadvertently freed from their mortal host. With the help of [[Doctor Strange]]'s magic, Brunnhilde regained her true body, which was rescued from [[Asgard (comics)|Niffleheim]] by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]]. Back in her real body, Brunnhilde regained her full memory and normal warrior personality as well. Brunnhilde then battled Amora and banished her to the crystal of souls.  Feeling estranged from Asgard in general and Odin in particular for their neglect of her centuries-long plight, Brunnhilde chose to return to Earth with the Defenders. She remained with them for several years.

Odin placed the dangerously powerful self-styled goddess [[Moondragon]] into Brunnhilde's charge. Brunnhilde was to teach Moondragon humility, and Moondragon served alongside Brunnhilde in the Defenders. Brunnhilde was to take action against Moondragon should she again become a menace. Eventually Moondragon reformed, but later she fell once again under the malevolent influence of the alien entity called the [[Dragon of the Moon]]. Moondragon attacked the Defenders, but Brunnhilde, given temporary additional powers by Odin for this occasion, including the power to grow to gigantic stature, opposed her. Brunnhilde summoned other Valkyries to her aid and together with two other Defenders, the [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] and [[Cloud (comics)|Cloud]], they defeated Moondragon but failed to capture her, however.

Months later Moondragon returned to attack the Defenders.  During this encounter, her power was vastly augmented by the alien Beyonder. In order to defeat the Dragon, Brunnhilde and the Eternal called [[Interloper]] projected their immortal life forces against it. They were joined by Defenders member [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]' former foe [[Manslaughter (comics)|Manslaughter]], for it was necessary that Brunnhilde's and Interloper's life forces pass through "mortal instruments" in order that [[Moondragon]] be defeated as well. Joining hands, the four allies hurled the tremendous power of their combined life forces at the Dragon, Moondragon, and the Gargoyle, whose body was now under the Dragon's control. Three other Defenders went to rescue endangered innocents, and when they returned, Brunnhilde, Interloper, Andromeda, Manslaughter, Moondragon and Gargoyle had all seemingly been transformed into statues of ashes and dust, and the Dragon of the Moon was apparently gone.<ref>''Defenders'' #152</ref>

When Doctor Strange was on the brink of death, he was drawn (in his astral form) toward a realm of the afterlife. There he saw Brunnhilda, who had come to escort him into the hereafter. Strange, however, refused, and after considerable effort, returned to life in the mortal world. It’s unclear whether Brunnhilde herself was dead and appeared to Strange in her astral form, or whether she still lives in physical form. It’s clear, however, that she once more serves to escort the spirits of dead heroes into the hereafter. [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/v/valkyrie.htm From Marvel Directory.com]

Brunnhilde was restored to life by Doctor Strange, now in the host body of a woman known as '''Sian Bowen'''. The other Defenders, Interloper, Andromeda and Manslaughter were restored to life as well and they formed the [[Defenders (comics)|Dragon Circle]] to battle the Dragon of the Moon. After the Dragon of the Moon was defeated, Brunnhilde returned to Asgard.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #3-4</ref>

===Fictional character biography===
Brunnhilde was killed in battle just before Loki's destruction of Asgard<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #82</ref>, but Samantha Parrington still lives.

On Earth, [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] and [[Lorelei (Marvel Comics)|Lorelei]] restored the Valkyrie's powers within Samantha Parrington. Pluto tricked Lorelei though, erasing her memory, draining her powers and turning her into a duplicate of Valkyrie. While Samantha was used by Pluto to turn Earth into a realm of the dead, Lorelei was found by the Defender [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], who believed she was the real Valkyrie and made her a Defender, though she never spoke. When the Defenders tried to stop Pluto, Lorelei battled Samantha and was restored to her former self. Samantha was freed from Pluto's control and she became part of the Defenders again as Valkyrie. Much to Parrington's chagrin, her parents are proud of her and turned their mansion into the Defenders base.

After ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Parrington is recruited as part of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] and training at the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]] facility amongst the other trainees.

===Powers and abilities===
[[Image:ValkyrieDefenders4.jpg|Cover of ''Defenders'' #4. by [[John Buscema]] & [[Frank Giacoia]].|thumb|left]]

Samantha Parrington can change from her mortal form into a copy of Brunnhilde's with all the latter's powers and skills.

====Weapons and equipment====
Valkyrie carries two weapons of choice.

* An enchanted sword named [[Dragonfang]]. An Oriental wizard named Kahji-Da was said to have carved the sword from a tooth of an extra-dimensional dragon.  The sword eventually passed into the possession of the [[Ancient One]], who in turn gave it to his disciple [[Doctor Strange]].  Strange awarded it to the Valkyrie after she had returned the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]'s [[Ebony Blade]], which she had been using, to its rightful owner.  The sword is virtually indestructible.
* An unnamed iron spear (presumably magical).

Valkyrie rides a winged horse by the name of [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]]. Aragorn was given to her by the current [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>''Defenders'' #11</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Valkyrie===
Ultimate Valkyrie is a 19-year-old girl named Barbara who aspires to play the public role of super hero, despite, at first, having no actual powers or skills (she describes herself as a female [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], only without the hammer, strength or weather-powers).  When [[Hank Pym]] was dismissed from the Ultimates, he decided to join the [[Defenders (comics)#Ultimate Defenders|Defenders]], a group of good hearted, but delusional, somewhat farcical individuals (basically hero wannabes with no real powers or sufficient fighting skills), which is where he met Barbara, who called herself "Thor-Girl", telling Pym during introductions that while she doesn't have any powers, she is extensively proficient in Martial Arts (Which turned out to be a lie to impress Pym. She later confesses to him that she barely made it to an Orange Belt in Karate and it took her several tries to pass the test). Almost obsessive in her own hero worship and aspirations, she and Hank had a brief affair mainly because he was a super-hero, but their attractions was more based on lust than love.  She also, at least in one instance, appeared to have a superhero [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], asking Pym to dress up as [[Captain America]] (see Ultimate Version). It is not explained how or when they broke up, but they weren't seen together again after the invasion of America at the end of the [[Ultimates 2]] series.

In ''Ultimate Saga'', when Tony Stark is looking through S.H.I.E.L.D files he sees a picture of the Defenders and Valkyrie. He says that he has to keep an eye on her for more than one reason. 
[[Image:ULTMTSV2006 COV.jpg|Cover to ''Ultimates'' (v2) #6. Art by Bryan Hitch.|thumb]] 

Valkyrie next appears in ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' #1, now apparently super-powered, riding a black [[winged horse|Pegasus]] and wielding a large, supposedly mystical sword that she uses to cleave [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] nearly in two, but seems to have no idea where these powers or weapons came from. At that point, she has been in a romantic live-in relationship with Thor for weeks and despite cultural differences, they are very close and allude to being in love. Since her last appearance, she appears to have been granted super strength and limited invulnerability; other superhuman attributes and abilities remain unknown. She speaks with a distinct [[valspeak|valley girl accent]], and while she seems not to be the most intelligent of her teammates, but makes up for it with her loyalty, especially to Thor, and her big heart, along with being very powerful. At several points, she makes references to having lived a quiet normal human life before becoming super-human. However, she suggests she is more akin to Thor than it may seem, possibly meaning they may have some sort of shared Asgardian heritage. Her deepest fear is returning to the powerless, poor and somewhat comically ordinary existence she had before.  When confronted with this fear by the illusion-casting [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)#Ultimate Mastermind|Mastermind]], she is broken free of the illusion (just before her two captors decide to assault her sexually) by a shadowy figure who claims to be the source of her new powers; she then retaliates by killing Mastermind and [[dismemberment|dismembering]] his partner [[Pyro (comics)#Ultimate Pyro|Pyro]], taking both hands off at the wrists with her sword.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #5</ref>

Later, in [[Ultimatum]], it is revealed that Valkyrie was killed and transported to Valhalla, the Asgardian afterlife for fallen warriors run by  [[Hela]], an Asgardian goddess, who is presented as above most other Asgardian gods in power and station. Thor learns of this and transports himself to Hela's dimension, demanding he let Valkyrie live again. Hela, then states that if he is able to overcome the challenge presented to him, he may bring Valkyrie back to the land of the living. In the middle of the ensuing battle, Thor finds that [[Captain America]]'s soul is also there, having been killed in the real world as well. Thor and Capt. America win the challenge and Hela grants Thor's request, but with the catch that once a soul has entered Hela's realm, it cannot leave without being substituted, so Thor gives up his soul so that Valkyrie may live and Hela returns her to Earth, whole and unharmed (Capt. America is also given a reprieve on his soul and is returned to the land of the living, but how this worked with the "Soul Quota" stipulation is not addressed), while Thors soul remains in the afterlife. Valkyrie, enraged and heart broken at the loss and sacrifice of her love, joins the battle once more and attacks [[Magneto]], severing his arm, trying to receive Thor's hammer and he uses his powers to slit her throat. She is briefly shown, still alive, until Magneto collapses the ceiling on her <ref>''Ultimatium'' #4</ref>. It is not known if she survived or not.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Valkyrie appears in the ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Mental Organism Designed Only for Kissing" voiced by [[Michelle Trachtenberg]].<ref>http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0903/07/index.htm</ref> Thor falls in love with her when she helps [[Ms. Marvel]], Thor, and [[Iron Man]] fight [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Fin Fang Foom]], and [[MODOK]]. When Iron Man tries to invite Valkyrie out to a "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]" performance, Valkyrie declines stating to Iron Man that his failure to gather the Infinity Sword Fractals.

===Film===
* The Brunnhilde version of Valkyrie appears in the "Hulk Vs. Thor" segment of the ''[[Hulk Vs.]]'' DVD. She and her Valkyrior troops defend Asgard from an attack by the Hulk, who had separated from Bruce Banner by Loki.

===Video games===
* Valkyrie appears as an NPC in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. She has a special dialogue with [[Deadpool]] and expresses an attraction to him due to his connection with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and his sense of humor. Deadpool does not share her feelings though due to a policy against dating people who could "strike him dead", but she just thought it was funny. She seems disgusted by [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]], Deadpool's friend who won't stop staring at her. Deadpool informs her that Weasel always reacts to attractive women that way, which is why he hasn't had a date since his cousin took him to the [[prom]]. In the game, there is an optional mission to find Valkyrie's sword Dragonfang somewhere in the god's graveyard near Bifrost Bridge. If the player finds her sword, Asgard will be easily freed with her aid, Loki will be imprisoned in chains, and Ragnarok never comes to pass. If the player doesn't find her sword, Valkyrie will die in the battle to prevent Ragnarok, Balder will die trying to save her, and the people of Asgard will be forbidden to contact Earth for a century. On a side note, she will recall Odin to Asgard to recover if he's freed from his dark magic confinement in Castle Doom.

==Notes==
* As stated above, Brunnhilde, the Valkyrie is based on the character of the same name in the [[Nibelungenlied]]. The story however had many incarnations; [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera version of it (''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'') shows a Brunnhilde the character's creators most likely have used for the conception of the Marvel persona (and, in fact, Marvel's free adaptation of Wagner's opera in ''Thor'' #296 features Marvel's Brunnhilde in that role, with Marvel's Thor as Siegmund).
* When [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] went insane with warrior madness, his insanity manifested as a woman, also called the Valkyrie. This Valkyrie had no relation to the regular Valkyries and had a different appearance.
