==Character Biography==

Brunnhilde was selected by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], monarch of the gods of the realm of [[Asgard]], to lead the [[Valkyrior]], the Choosers of the Slain, a group of warrior goddesses who would appear over the battlefields of mortal worshippers of the Asgardian gods and choose which of the fallen were worthy to be taken to [[Valhalla]], the land of the honored dead in the dimension of Asgard. Brunnhilde served [[Asgard]] capably in this capacity for centuries.

According to a sentient, disembodied eye that one belonged to [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], the Asgardian monarch once gave his son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] the mortal identity of the warrior [[Siegmund]]. Circumstances reluctantly forced [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] to decree that [[Siegmund]] must be slain. Brunnhilde, recognizing that [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] was acting against his true wishes, sought to protect [[Siegmund]], but [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] himself then caused [[Siegmund]]'s death. Brunnhilde helped [[Siegmund]]'s pregnant lover, [[Sieglinde]], get to safety. As punishment for her defiance, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] removed Brunnhildes godly powers and immortality and cast her into a trance. She was eventually awakened by [[Siegfried]], who was the son of [[Siegmund]] and [[Sieglinde]] and was a mortal reincarnation of [[Thor (Marvel Comics|Thor]]. 

Brunnhilde and [[Siegfried]] became lovers, but [[Siegfried]] fell under the influence of magic and betrayed her. [[Siegfried]] was later murdered, and Brunnhilde, still in love with him, leapt into his blazing funeral [[pyre]]. [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] restored both [[Siegfried]] and Brunnhilde to life, giving them back their godly roles, powers, and near-immortality as [[Thor (Marvel Comics|Thor]] and the Valkyrie, but removing their memories of their recent lives on Earth. It is unclear how much truth, if any, there is to this account by the eye.

Brunnhilde and her fellow Valkyries continued to gather heroic mortal warriors for [[Valhalla]] until roughly a millennium ago, when [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] was forced to cease virtually all intercourse with the Earth in accordance with a pact that he and the leaders of Earth's other pantheons of gods made with extraterrestrial [[Celestials]]. From then onward, the Valkyries could only choose slain heroes from among fallen Asgardian warriors. Brunnhilde was bitter over being barred from choosing warriors on Earth and roamed [[Asgard]] in pursuit of something meaningful to do.

In a tavern on the outskirts of [[Marmoragard]], Brunnhilde encountered [[Amora the Enchantress]], who offered her a life of adventure. For several weeks Brunnhilde accompanied [[the Enchantress]] on her conquests. Brunnhilde soon discovered [[Amore]]'s inclinations towards immorality and tried to end their partnership. In response [[Amore]] entrapped Brunnhilde within a mystic crystal of souls. With Brunnhildes body remained in suspended animation, her immortal soul became [[Amora]]'s plaything. Over the centuries [[the Enchantress]] used Brunnhilde's spiritual essence to give the Valkyrie’s powers to herself or to her pawns. [[The Enchantress]] usually used her magic to alter the recipient's appearance to resemble Brunnhilde herself.

Specific instances of [[Amore]]'s exploitation of the Valkyrie before recent years are not yet known. The first time [[Amore]] assumed the Valkyrie's physical aspect in recent years was in a plot to lead a handful of female superhumans against the male [[Avengers]]. Her true identity was discovered, however, and her plan thwarted. Months later, [[the Enchantress]] bestowed the Valkyries power upon a socialite named Samantha Parrington in an attempt to get revenge on [[the Hulk]].

Finally, a woman driven mad by being trapped in another mystical dimension, Barbara Norriss, was given the Valkyrie's power and consciousness by [[Amora]] in order to help [[the Enchantress]] and her erstwhile allies, the group of superhumans called [[the Defenders]], escape from the clutches of the sorceress [[Casiolena]]. [[Amora]] did not undo her spell on Norriss after [[Casiolena]]'s defeat. As a result, Norrisss body now possessed Brunnhilda's consciousness, appearance, and powers, while Norriss’s own mental essence was trapped in Brunnhildes real body in [[Asgard]]. However, thanks to partial amnesia induced by [[the Enchantress]], Brunnhilde was unaware that she was not in possession of her real body and full memory. Indeed, while trapped in Norriss’s body Brunnhilde personality lacked much of its usual strength of will.

It was not until a minor Asgardian warrior named [[Ollerus]] attempted to take over [[Valhalla]] that the Valkyrie’s two mixed aspects met for the first time. Brunnhilde’s mental essence trapped Norriss’s transformed body, fought Norriss’s mental essence trapped in Brunnhilde’s real body. At the end of that encounter, the Valkyrie’s body, still possessed by Norriss’s mind was consigned to [[Niffiehelm]], the realm inhabited by the spirits at the non-heroic Asgardian dead, while Brunnhilde’s mind in Norriss’s transformed body accompanied [[the Defenders]], who had made the other dimensional journey with her, back to Earth.

For reasons yet unknown, Brunnhilde was not concerned at this time about reuniting her mind with her true body. It was not until Barbara Norriss’s body was murdered that the Valkyries spirit and mind were inadvertently freed from their mortal host. With the help of [[Doctor Strange]]s magic, Brunnhilde regained her true body, which was rescued from [[Niffleheim]] by [[the Enchantress]]. Back in her real body, Brunnhilde regained her full memory and normal warriors personality as well. Brunnhilde then battled [[Amore]] and banished her into the crystal of souls in which she had been trapped.

Feeling estranged from [[Asgard]] in general and [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] in particular for their neglect of her centuries-long plight, Brunnhilde chose to return to Earth with her mortal friends, [[the Defenders]], rather than to remain in [[Asgard]]. She had joined [[the Defenders]] after their battle with [[Casiolena]] and remained with them continuously until the group finally came to one of its end.

[[Odin (comics)|Odin]] placed the dangerously powerful self-styled goddess [[Moondragon]] into Brunnhilde's charge. Brunnhilde was to teach [[Moodragon]] humility, and [[Moondragon]] served alongside Brunnhilde in [[the Defenders]]. Brunnhilde was to take action against [[Moondragon]] should she again become a menace. Eventually [[Moondragon]] reformed, but later she fell once again under the malevolent influence of the alien entity called [[the Dragon of the Moon]]. [[Moondragon]] attacked [[the Defenders]], but Brunnhilde, given temporary additional powers by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] for this occasion, including the power to grow to gigantic stature, opposed her. Brunnhilde summoned other Valkyries to her aid and together with two other [[Defenders]], [[the Angel]] and [[Cloud]], they battled and, thanks to [[Cloud]] especially, defeated [[Moondragon]]. [[Moondragon]] escaped, however

Months later [[Moondragon]] returned to attack [[the Defenders]], and during the encounter her power was vastly augmented by the alien Beyonder. In order to defeat the Dragon, Brunnhilde and the Eternal called [[Interloper]] projected their immortal life forces against it. They were joined by [[the Defender]] [[Andromeda]] and [[the Defenders]]’ former foe [[Manslaughter]], for it was necessary that Brunnhilde’s and [[Interloper]]’s life forces pass through “mortal instruments” in order that [[Moondragon]] be defeated as well. Joining hands, the four allies hurled the tremendous power of their combined life forces at the Dragon, [[Moondragon]], and [[Grey Gargoyle|The Gargoyle]], whose body was now under the Dragons control. Three other [[Defenders]] went to rescue endangered innocents, and when they returned, Brunnhilde, [[Interloper]], [[Andromeda]], [[Manslaughter]], [[Moondragon]] and [[Grey Gargoyle|The Gargoyle]] had all seemingly been transformed into statues of ashes and dust, and the [[Dragon of the Moon]] was apparently gone.

Recently when [[Doctor Strange]] was on the brink of death, his astral form found itself being drawn towards a realm of the afterlife. His astral form saw Brunnhilda, who had come to escort him into the hereafter. Strange, however, refused, and after considerable effort, returned to life in the mortal world. It’s unclear whether Brunnhilde herself was dead and appeared to Strange in her astral form, or whether she still lives in physical form. It’s clear, however, that she once more serves to escort the spirits of dead heroes into the hereafter. http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/v/valkyrie.htm From Marvel Directory.com


==Powers & Abilities==

Valkyrie is the strongest of any female [[Asgardian]].  She can lift up to 45 tons.  Like any other [[Asgardian]], her tissue/bone is about 3 times as dense as a human tissue/bone.  She is not immortal but she will live longer than any human being.  Valkyrie can not be stricken with disease and she is resistant to conventional injury.  Her endurance will peak after one hour of exerting energy hence fatigue begins and ability level drops.

Valkyrie is enabled with the advantage of seeing death before it comes.  She see's a "deathglow" which surrounds a persons body and signals to Valkyrie that death is near for that person.  She doesn't know how death will come but she can tell that it is eminant.

Valkyrie can transport herself and a dying or dead body to and from the realm of the dead only by willing herself to do so.

Valkyrie has had extensive sword training as well as unarmed combat and horseback riding.  Her natural fighting ability is one of the best among Asgardian females, and is only matched by [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]]. 

==Weapons & Equipment==

Valkyrie carries two weapons of choice.

1. An enchanted sword named [[Dragonfang]]. The blade was fashioned from a tooth of an extra-dimensional dragon.  
2. An unamed iron spear.

Valkyrie rides a winged horse by the name of Aragorn.  Aragorn was given to her by the current [[Black Knight (Marvel Comics)|Black Knight]].
