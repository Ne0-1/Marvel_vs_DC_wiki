'''Lifeguard''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]]ine in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #6.

Her real name is Heather Cameron and she and her brother Davis (see [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]]) lived perfectly normal lives at Surfer's Paradise in [[Australia]]. Unfortunately they did not know that their father was an underworld crime lord, and upon his death they were attacked.  Together with [[Storm]] and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird (Neal Shaara)]], they managed to defeat their attackers. Heather's mutant power proved to be whatever she needed it to be to save lives, including her own. Some fans of the comic regard this as the ultimate [[deus ex machina]].

Later, when infiltrating the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather's appearance changed and it was suspected she had [[Shi'ar]] heritage.  Her brother was unable to see past her new, alien appearance and ran away. Lifeguard and Thunderbird went in search of him. After they reconciled, both siblings left the X-Men.
