Heather and [[Slipstream (comics)|Davis Cameron]] were a lifeguard and a surfer, respectively, living in [[Surfers Paradise]] in [[Australia]]. Unbeknownst to them, their father is an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]], and upon his death they were attacked.  Together with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Neal Shaara]] (the new Thunderbird), they managed to defeat their attackers. Heather discovered she was a mutant with the power to manifest whatever was necessary to save the life of someone in danger around her, including her own.  Her power enabled her to manifest wings, golden armor, the ability to breathe underwater, and many other less noticeable adaptations. Heather soon joined the splinter team of X-Men, and formed a romance with Thunderbird.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #9 March 2002">''X-Treme X-Men'' #9 (March 2002)</ref>

During a mission to infiltrate the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather's appearance changes to resemble the alien [[Shi'ar]] race, and it was theorized that she and Davis had some [[Shi'ar]] heritage. [[Jean Grey]] notes that the cranial markings on her head and the crest of feathers she had manifested indicated Heather is of Shi'ar royal ancestry.  Also, an entry from [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diary seems to imply that Heather and Davis were "Mothered by War," or [[Deathbird]].  The entry shows a picture of Deathbird and some of the X-Treme team.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #10 April 2002">''X-Treme X-Men'' #10 (April 2002)</ref>  Her brother, unable to see past her new, alien appearance, leaves the team.  Lifeguard and Thunderbird travel in search of him.<ref name="X-Treme X-Men #19 December 2002">''X-Treme X-Men'' #19 (December 2002)</ref>

===The Xavier Institute===
Months later, Lifeguard and Thunderbird returned to the X-Men, apparently not locating Slipstream. Together with Thunderbird, she joined the [[X-Corporation]]. However this only lasted weeks, as there was a synchronized attack on several of the X-Corporation offices after the catastrophic events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], leading [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] to call for the disbanding of all offices.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Heather is one of a handful of mutants to have retained her powers in the wake of [[House of M]]. Still involved with Thunderbird III she wasn't active in any X-Men roster, though the ''198 Files'' verified her location as residing at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]].

===Utopia===
Heather later resurfaces after the events of Schism as a member of Cyclops' street team with Boom Boom and Dazzler in San Francisco and [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Heather's mutant power allows her body to react to any threat by transforming or manifesting a power to deal with the situation (similar to that of the X-Men's [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]]).  In all of her appearances, she has only been shown to use this ability while defending herself and others.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #9</ref>It is as yet unknown if she's able to use this ability for her own protection. She has a moderate level of control over this power and has sometimes been able to trigger it at will, although she has not displayed any control over the transformations or powers she manifests. So far, Heather has only manifested physical changes such as extra arms, armored skin, wings, and a mermaid tail.

In her most recent appearance, she appeared to be locked into her final transformation of gold skin, wings, and claws; still unable to control her powers and possibly unable to transform any further or reverse the change.

==Other versions==
===''X-Men: The End''===
Lifeguard appears in ''X-Men: The End'' as a protector of [[Aliyah Bishop]] in the [[Shi'ar]] Imperium.  She is ultimately killed sacrificing herself for Aliyah.
