'''Lifeguard''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  She first appeared in X-treme X-men #6.

Her real name is Heather Cameron and she and her brother Davis lived perfectly normal lives at Surfer's Paradise in Australia.  Unfortunately they did not know that there father was an underworld crime lord, and on his death they were attacked.  Together with [[Storm]] and [[Thunderbird II]], they managed to defeat their attackers.  Heather's mutant power proved to be whatever she needed it to be to save lives.

Later, when infiltrating the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan]], Heather's appearance changed and it was suspected she has [[Shi-ar]] heritage.  Her brother was unable to see past her new, alien appearance and ran away.  Lifeguard and [[Thunderbird II]] went in search of him.
