Heather and [[Slipstream (comics)|Davis Cameron]] were a lifeguard and a surfer, respecitvely, living in [[Surfer's Paradise]] in [[Australia]]. Unbeknownst to them, their father was an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]], and upon his death they were attacked.  Together with [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Neal Shaara]] (the new Thunderbird), they managed to defeat their attackers. Heather discovered she was a mutant with the power to manifest whatever was necessary to save the life of someone in danger around her, including her own.  Her power enabled her to manifest wings, golden armor, the ability to breathe underwater, and many other less noticeable adaptations.  Some comic fans have seen this ability as the ultimate [[deus ex machina]], which led to a somewhat negative reception of Claremont's new character.  Heather soon joined the splinter team of X-Men, and formed a romance with Thunderbird. 

During a mission to infiltrate the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather's appearance changed to resemble the alien [[Shi'ar]] race, and it was theorized that she and Davis had some [[Shi'ar]] heritage.  Her brother, unable to see past her new, alien appearance, left the team.  Lifeguard and Thunderbird went in search of him. 

Lifeguard and Thunderbird recently turned up on [[Genosha]], helping out with the local X-Corporation.
