'''''Justice''''' is a character from the [[New Universe]] imprint of [[Marvel Comics]], the protagonist of a 32-issue [[comic book]] series of the same name published from [[1986]] to [[1989]]. The title was notable for featuring the early work of [[Peter David]] and [[Lee Weeks]] as well as rare [[1980s]] Marvel work from [[Keith Giffen]].  Despite uneven writing and a drastic change in concept in mid-run, ''Justice'' was arguably the most successful title of the failed New Universe imprint, being the only one to maintain a monthly release schedule until the end of the New Universe.

Note that this is a different character than the identically named [[Justice (comics)|Justice]] of Marvel's standard, "[[Marvel 616 |616]]" continuity.

==Origin & Outline==
Justice (his given name initially only "Tensen") first appeared in contemporary New York City in the year 1986, claiming to be a law-enforcing knight from another dimension, the "Far Place," although his recollections were vague. Compelled to use his preternatural abilities to fight criminals, he acted as a vigilante against street hoods, drug dealers and gangsters while trying to recall more of where he came from and how he ended up on Earth.

The character was distinctive for his self-assured but merciless, literally black-and-white, sense of right and wrong: he frequently executed the criminals he caught, even if they surrendered.  In this manner Justice recalled the old [[Charlton Comics]] character [[The Question]] created by [[Steve Ditko]]. He was also visually striking, wearing a decidedly [[New Wave]] costume: a grey trenchcoat, silver-white shirt and slacks featureless except for a rainbow-thunderbolt insignia crossing the front torso, grey boots with thick rings encircling the ankles, a pair of narrow visor sunglasses (though these glasses disappeared after the first few issues) and grey-white hair cut into a flattop-mullet. Physically, Justice was lean rather than muscular and middle-aged rather than youthful. An early story described him as "talking like a preacher, but dressed like a rockstar."

==Powers & Abilities==
Justice was able to create a personal force-field with his left hand (which he referred to as his "shield"), and fire a deadly blast of energy with his right hand (his "sword").  Furthermore, he was able to see people's auras and thereby judge instantly whether they were inherently good or evil (this being the primary reason for his draconian morality, though later it was said he could mainly read paranormals). In addition, he was a master of hand-to-hand combat and could apparently heal severe injuries by concentrating.  (At one point, he apparently regenerated his right hand over a period of one month after it had been lost in a fight with one of Darquill's creatures; however, for a time his "sword" no longer functioned reliably.  Since Justice never performed such a feat after his illusions were dispelled [see below], and since these events happened during the period Justice had trouble differentiating fantasy from reality, it is unknown whether this power, too, was an illusion.)

Later, when Justice surfaced in the Marvel Universe of 2099, his powers changed drastically (see below).

==The Series (1986-1989)==
Justice began as an alien warrior (called a "Justice Warrior") in the employ of King Therion and Queen Endolana of the Land of Spring in the Far Place.  After having an illicit affair with the queen, he was exiled to Earth by the king's wizard, Webstral.  On Earth, he took on the mission to stop the series' central villain, Daedalus Darquill, and his son, Damon Conquest, evil wizards from the Land of Winter, the royals' opposition. Arriving around the same time as the "White Event" that gave humans paranormal abilities, he learned Earth's ways while befriending DEA agent Rebecca Chambers, a black woman with a "golden aura" denoting utmost purity, and Arnie, a cab driver. He battled Hounds, soulless creatures created by Darquill, and hordes of drug addicts and common criminals. Eventually, Becky was brainwashed by the Wizards of Winter against Justice, who was framed for her murder (a body faked by the Wizards). Corrupted from the brief loss of his arm in battle, Justice briefly resorted to using a gun to kill criminals, but abandoned the idea shortly after implementation. Justice subsequently battled and savagely killed Black Justice, a "Justice Warrior" like Tensen who had succumbed to his darker natures. His dire emotional state fed a machine constructed by the Wizards that helped them to destroy Spring. Webstral escaped to Earth and, as he told of Spring's fall and the king's death, healed Justice of the impurity caused by his earlier injuries before perishing.

After a few more adventures that had no or little alien elements, Justice's origin was significantly [[retcon]]ned with the ostensible goal of making it more compliant with the originally stated premise of the New Universe line - a "realistic" setting devoid of the cliched aliens and alternate dimensions of traditional [[superhero]] stories. The series was handed off to writer [[Peter David]] who along with one issue's co-plotter, [[Mark Gruenwald]], transformed the character into an obsessive, [[sociopathic]] vigilante with a quasi-religious fixation. All of Tensen's memories and activities in his "home" dimension were revealed to have been a delusion induced by Darquill. He was a DEA agent named John Tensen, a family man whose wife had been killed by vengeful members of organized crime. He was undercover at the time of the "White Event," investigating Darquill and Conquest, who were running drugs out of their front company, Conquest Dynamics.  Soon after, he began experiencing headaches as his psionic powers manifested.  Eventually his cover was blown, and Darquill used his own newfound parability to convince himself, Tensen, and the others around him that they were all alien players in a fantasy scenario.  Justice went to his fellow hero Keith Remsen, a.k.a. [[Nightmask (comics)|Nightmask]], and the two of them defeated Darquill, after which Keith spent months honing Tensen's mental defenses so that he could never again be enthralled as Darquill had done.  Still, whenever Tensen was excessively drugged, he once again retreated into his "Justice Warrior" persona, suffering severe audiovisual hallucinations.

Following the status-quo-changing issue #15, Tensen re-evaluated his existence in the wake of Darquill's death.  He changed his costume, keeping the trenchcoat he often wore, now accompanied by a purple-and-white outfit with a modified lightning-bolt insignia on the chest.  He decided to continue punishing the guilty, only now he turned his sights squarely on paranormals who abused their abilities.  Using his aura-reading abilities to detect paranormals, he immolated those he deemed unfit, leaving only his victims' heads and hands intact and drawing the scales of justice in their ashes.  In this way he became known as "The Justice Killer" by newspapers.  During this time, he befriended Miriam Morse, a.k.a. Playback, a psychic who could replay images of crime scenes.  Strangely, when she replayed the scenes, Tensen could detect her presence there, even though no time-travel was involved.  Also, his behavior encouraged a gang of vigilantes to emulate him (leading to a humorous sequence in which the gang, trying to name themselves after their inspiration, considered such titles as the [[Justice League]], the [[Justice Society]] and other allusions to [[DC Comics]] groups), culminating in a disturbing finale where, after Justice told them to cease their activities, they committed group suicide in an explosion.

The authorities, including the [[National Security Agency]], pursued and caught Justice at Pitt-Aid, a concert to benefit the victims of the Black Event (the destruction of [[Pittsburgh]] due to a paranormal catastrophe).  Remembering his roots as an agent for the Department of Justice, Tensen agreed to serve as a special operative of the NSA. Around this time, he also was reintroduced to his estranged daughter, Angela, who had the paranormal ability to reanimate the dead (such as she did with her cat, Figaro).  In addition, he fought criminals including the assassin Quill; Judge Mental, leader of the Forsaken, a group of freakish paranormals hiding at Coney Island; and Mental's right-hand man, Seraph.  He also encountered the group [[Psi-Force]], both during the battle in Washington where the Psi-Hawk was killed, and afterward, in Russia.

By the series' end, Justice had shed his government ties, and, along with his daughter and her boyfriend, Victor "Kleenex" Pasko (so named because he was allergic to paranormals), left to preside over the Forsaken after he killed Judge Mental and Seraph.

==Appearances in Other Media==
A version of Justice's story completed itself in the 1992 novel, ''Psi-Man, Book 6: Haven'', published by Diamond Books.  Original ''Justice'' series writer Peter David wrote the novel under the pseudonym of David Peters.  The novel's protagonist, Chuck Simon, possessed superhuman mental powers; as such, he was constantly chased by government operatives.  In the finale of the six-book series, Simon arrived at Coney Island for a final showdown.  Due to legal reasons, David could not use the name or likeness of Tensen, so instead he tweaked the character's name and role, inventing the character of Tom Jensen, a.k.a. The Magistrate, who presided over freakish superhuman beings at the former Coney Island amusement park circa 2021.  With some deviances, Jensen shared most of the abilities and some history with his Marvel Comics counterpart.  Jensen allied himself with Simon and saved his life, dying in the process.

The entire ''Psi-Man'' novel series was rereleased in 2000 by Ace Books in new editions under the author's correct name.

==Justice in the 1990s==
Despite the collapse of the New Universe, Peter David retained a fondness for the character, and in late 1993 re-introduced Justice in the [[Marvel 2099]] line's ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' comic-book as the "Net Prophet," a.k.a. the Prophet of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He appeared from a portal into a dimension 2099 scientist Jordan Boone dubbed "Virtual Unreality," from whence also came Thanatos, an alternate-timeline version of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] in search of powerful relics from other worlds. Although Tensen claimed to remember Thanatos, the events surrounding any such encounter are unclear. Tensen began his life in 2099 as an amnesiac, and with altered powers. (Gone were his trademark psionic "sword" and "shield," replaced by laser eyebeams, and teleportation powers that required his hands be freed.) He and Spider-Man defeated Thanatos, then Tensen had adventures of his own, confronting similar themes of hero worship as on his Earth. Keeping near the Church of St. Patrick in New York's Downtown area, he befriended and later romanced Jennifer D'Angelo, a priest at the church and sister to Spider-Man's fiancee, Dana. When last seen in 2099, Tensen had remembered his real name and met Spider-Man's former girlfriend, Xina Kwan, who was then leaving New York City for parts unknown. He joined her, and in that particular timeline, neither was seen again.

Additionally, in early 1994, Justice, in his original costume (perhaps an editorial snafu, or an allusion to another lapse in the character's mental state), appeared in the ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' and [[Starblast]] comic book series, whose storyline centered around the attempts of a cyborg named Skeletron and his band of "Starblasters" to procure the nearly unlimited power of the [[Star Brand (comics)|Star Brand]].  Several Marvel Universe characters banded together with a handful of representatives from the New Universe Earth, including Justice, to defeat the Starblasters.  Through a twist of fate, the planet was thrust through a dimensional breach and arrived in the [[Marvel 616]] Universe.  It currently orbits [[Stranger's Labworld|the Stranger's laboratory world]], its inhabitants quarantined behind a force shield devised by the [[Living Tribunal]].  It is unlikely the events of this storyline have any direct impact on Justice's 2099 appearances, as the appearances of Justice as the Net Prophet predate his appearances here.

==Recent Appearances==
More recently, Justice, along with many other characters from the New Universe, has appeared in the pages of ''[[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]]'' as part of their "World Tour" story arc. The Justice depicted in this storyline is as the character originally appeared, ignoring the later changes by David, indicating a previous divergent point in continuity (perhaps as early as ''Justice'' #1 or 2). So far, the story has featured Justice battling the mutant called [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] (possessing the body of Mimic) in order to thwart his attempts to possess the Star Brand. Justice lost the battle, and Proteus possessed him. It is possible from this series of events, and from the fact that the next mini-arc in the "World Tour" storyline (#75-76) centers on 2099, that Proteus' journeys are the method by which Tensen arrives there, loses his memories, and becomes the Net Prophet, as above, but those events have yet to be seen.

==Future Appearances==

As per Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]], ''Justice'' is one of five New Universe titles that will experience a revival in a one-shot special during a fifth-week event shipping in March 2006.  The one-shot will feature an "untold tale" of Justice from the pre-Pitt period, by the creative team of former series writer David and artist Carmine Di Giandomenico, with a cover by Eric Canete.  He also will be featured in [[Warren Ellis]]' [[Ultimate Marvel]]-style rejuvenation of the New Universe concepts in an ongoing Marvel title tentatively called ''[[newuniversal]]'' and shipping after the aforementioned fifth-week event.
