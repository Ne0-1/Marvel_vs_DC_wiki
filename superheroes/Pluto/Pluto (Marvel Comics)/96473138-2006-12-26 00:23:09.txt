'''Hades''' is a [[fiction|fictional]] [[deity]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]] based on the [[Hades|Greek God of the same name]]. Hades first appeared in the pages of ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #127, written by [[Stan Lee]] and drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]. He usually prefers to use his [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name, '''Pluto''' these days. 

==Character history==

Hades is the god of Tartarus. Much of his past is like how he was related in the [[Hades#Hades, the lord of the Underworld|Greek Myth]].  He was similar to the other Marvel Greek Gods like [[Zeus]]. After defeating their father [[Cronus]], Hades and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon as well as his sisters Hera, Hestia and Demeter drew lots to divide Cronus' empire among them. Hades soon ruled the [[Hades#Hades the abode of the dead|Underworld]] as the judge of the dead. But in the [[Marvel Universe]], Hades is a scheming god that plans to overthrow Zeus which no Greek Myth supports.

His most infamous act was when he took Zeus' and  [[Demeter]]'s daughter, his niece [[Persephone]] (also known as Kore) as his wife against her will.  This event would cause him some dismal failures in the future; for instance the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] once defeated Hades when Persephone issued an edict. He also became a major enemy of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], when the young Hercules captured Hades' dog [[Cerberus]] as one of his [[The Twelve Labours|Twelve Labours]]. 

When worship of the Greek Gods died out, Zeus forbid Hades of taking anymore souls into his underworld. Hades became bitter and started to plot against Zeus. Zeus noticed this and told Hades that he had to remain ruler of the underworld until he found a willing replacement. Hades went to Earth and disguised himself as Mr. Hellman, a movie producer and invited Hercules to make a movie about him. While Hercules signed the contract into ruling the underworld, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] fought and defeated Hades. Hercules was released from the contract, but Thor had earned Hades' enmity.  

Hades attempted several times to invade both [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], home of the Greek Gods and [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], home of Thor and his fellow [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]]. His plans failed again. Hades decides to seek out allies. He allied himself to Queen [[Hippolyta|Hippolyte]] and [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], his nephew, who also thought that Zeus refusal to force the humans to worship them was a mistake. However Hippolyte only wanted Hercules' love. Hades tried to sponsor the divorce of Hercules and [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] to marry Hercules to Hippolyte as well as Ares to marry [[Venus (comics)|Aphrodite]].  

According to Olympian law, Hecrules and Aphrodite would not be allowed to fight their partners when Hippolyte and Ares assisted Hades in conquering Olympus.  However this plan failed again as Zeus after some hesitation at first, finally forbade the marriages. 

To circumvent Zeus' decree, Hades tried to conquer Earth with the help of [[Lorelei (Marvel Comics)|Lorelei]]. Hades turned Lorelei into a copy of the [[Valkyrie (comics)|Valkyrie]] and drained her of her power and memories. He then used the absorbed power to take control of the real Valkyrie to turn Earth into a realm of the dead itself. The Valkyrie's presence would mask his own influence and Zeus' decree still allowed Hades to annex other realms of the dead. Hades was stopped by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] who brought Lorelei along, thinking her to be their teammate. The clash of the two Valkyrie's released Lorelei from the spell and together they turned on Hades and ended his plan.

With the disappearance of the Asgardians after [[Ragnar√∂k]], Zeus feared for the continued existence of the Olympians as well and decided that they should mingle among humanity to hide from any force threatening them. Hades became a crimelord, joking that he was still a lord of the underworld. The plan was shortlived though and the Olympians returned to Mount Olympos, where they came under siege by the Japanese god [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].

===Powers and abilities===
Hades has superhuman strength and endurance like all Marvel Olympians, but he is stronger than most of them. He is also immortal; he doesn't age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases and poisons and while he can be wounded, most wounds he will receive will heal quickly. Only extreme force would be able to kill him and even then his divine essence may be untouched, allowing him to be resurrected. 
Hades has vast magical powers which he can use for various effects like teleportation, energy blasts and protective shields.  
As a Death God, Hades has a pact with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], allowing him to claim the souls of any worshipper of the Greek Gods and take them to his Underworld as his servants. He can drain the energy from any opponent he touches. The various Death Gods have their own alliance, though there is some internal competition as well, as seen when both [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] and Hades tried to claim the soul of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] after his death. 

Hades owns a helmet which makes him invisible and undetectable, even to his fellow gods. He also owns several [[adamantine#In mythology and fiction|adamantine]] axes. These axes are nearly indestructible and can channel and focus his energy blasts.
