'''Nite-Wing''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]''. 

==History==
'''Tad Ryerstad''' is a [[sociopath]] and possesses a great deal of rage while being prone to loud outbursts, as well as frequently referring to himself in the third person. The similarities between his name and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing's]] has gotten him in trouble in the past, and has nearly led to him being murdered on two different occasions. 

Having grown up an [[orphan]], the man who would become Nite-Wing never gained a legal name. Instead, he goes by the first name Tad - originally [[Tadpole]], the nickname he was given whilst in the orphanage because of his diminutive size. He later adopts the last name of Ryerstad, which is the name of a local [[beer]] brand. Tad ran away from the orphanage at age 12, and was "forgotten"- further proof that [[Blüdhaven]] is seeped in corruption and decay. He educated himself devouring [[popular culture]] by stealing paperbacks and comic books and sneaking into countless movies. This inadequate and twisted education, combined with an unstable and loveless childhood, produced a sociopath who believes himself to be a hero.
 
Tad exercised, kept himself in good shape, and patrolled his neighborhood, doing “good.” He beat people for minor offences, and performed acts of [[Vigilante|vigilantism]] at its worst. One day, he met [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|John Law]], the retired hero "Tarantula", and after hearing his stories, decided to become a [[superhero]]. He had difficulty coming up with a name until he looked across the street from his [[apartment]] at an all-night [[deli]] specializing in [[chicken wings]]. Thus, Nite-Wing was born.

Unfortunately, on his first night out, he ran into a gang that shot him repeatedly. Rushed off to an emergency room, Nightwing spent the whole night defending him from [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster's]] men, who thought it was Nightwing who was in the hospital. Tad was released from the hospital, and went back to take revenge on the gang who put him there, killing them. 

Tad’s rampage continued, killing men who worked for Blockbuster, eventually even Ricky Noone, one of his major capos. One night, he was cornered by Dudley Soames, the former police inspector turned psychopath, who now called himself [[Torque_%28comics%29|Torque]]. Here he finally met Nightwing. The two escaped Torque, and Nightwing agreed to help train Tad, not realizing how violent he could be.

Tad cornered Bludhaven’s corrupt Police Chief Redhorn, and got all the files he had pertaining to Blockbuster. Presenting them to Nightwing, the two began to attack Blockbuster’s powerbase. They were captured and separated. When Cisco Blaine, an undercover FBI agent, came to free Tad, Tad beat him to death. Upon discovering that he wasn’t a bad guy, but really a cop, Tad fled. Nightwing eventually tracked him down, and he was imprisoned in Lockhaven Penitentiary.

When Torque was captured by Nightwing, he was made Tad’s cellmate. Torque had a plan to escape, and he made Tad part of it. They drugged the food of Aaron Hellzinger, the prison guard who was the reformed villain [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]], and when he went berserk, the two escaped. Tad killed Soames after his escape, and was implicated in the murder of Chief Redhorn. However, Tad was innocent of that crime, set up by Blockbuster and the new [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Tarantula II|Tarantula]], and he contacted Nightwing to help clear himself. Tad was arrested again, along with Tarantula, and resides again in Lockhaven, serving his time for the murders of Cisco Blaine and Torque.

==True origins==

In ''Nightwing'' #51, "Tad's Story" reveals the detailed history of Tad, but contradicts the previous claim of him being abandoned. Instead, the story shows both of his parents alive; his father Randy as an abusive alcoholic and his mother perpetually using the phone and smoking. Due to his lack of parental involvement, Tad begins to read comic books as a means of escapist fantasy. 

Soon, he begins to resent his father, who earns money through the sale of stolen goods. Believing firmly in the world of comic books, Tad performs an act he believes to be heroic: the framing of his father. Tad contacts his father's crack-dealer of an employer and accuses his father of being a [[Informant|snitch]]. As a result, his father is murdered and his mother sent to jail.

After being sent to live with foster parents, he runs away and begins to live on his own. Due to his lack of a job, he is usually a [[vagrant]], and can afford to feed himself only through stealing from criminals.

Following his capture at the hands of Nightwing and subsequent arrest for the murder of Cisco Blaine, he is revealed to have been left on a [[Blüdhaven]] bus on [[Christmas Eve]].

==Modus operandi==
Nite-Wing sees himself as a hero, and he seeks to bring justice to the world, but his methods are very flawed; he has killed a number of people, including an undercover [[FBI]] agent. Tad does not appear to understand the consequences of his actions, merely shrugging off any regret or responsibility by stating that he is a "good guy".

==Powers and abilities==
Tad has no superpowers, however he is a capable and ruthless [[Street fighting|street fighter]]. Often he carries many [[billiard]] balls taped to his back and uses a modified three-foot pool stick as a weapon.
