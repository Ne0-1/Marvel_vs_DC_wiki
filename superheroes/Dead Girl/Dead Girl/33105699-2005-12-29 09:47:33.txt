A [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[X-Statix]] series, '''Dead Girl''' was also a mixture of [[ghost]] and [[zombie]]. Her civilian name was never revealed, but it is known that her mutant gene allowed her to return to semi-life after dying. She also had the power to become intangible and communicate with other dead people. Dead Girl was also the girlfriend of [[Anarchist (comics)|Anarchist]].

==Origin==
Dead Girl had few memories of when she was still alive; she believes she was a young actress who was murdered by her co-star/lover, who then sealed her body inside a [[mausoleum]]. The dead heard her cries and lured the killer back to the crypt in which he had buried her. Dead Girl awoke and took her revenge on him. Eventually, X-Force (soon to be renamed X-Statix) hired her and invited her to join them. 

Along with the other members of X-Statix, she was killed in the series-ending issue #26. 

{{spoiler}}
Dead Girl will be getting a limited series titled '''''X-Statix: Dead Girl Special'''''. The series will run for five issues. This series will focus on a vengeful dead villain intent on gathering other dead villains, with only Dead Girl and her dead friends to stop them.  Guest stars include Dr. Strange and the (dead) Orphan.  Peter Milligan, Mike Allred and Nick Dragotta will be providing script, covers, and interior art respectively.[http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=477ee74b4b4f2931147c2adbab56db2e&threadid=39976]
