A [[mutant]] [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[X-Statix]] series, '''Dead Girl''' was also a mixture of [[ghost]] and [[zombie]]. Her civilian name was never revealed, but it is known that her mutant gene allowed her to return to semi-life after dying. She also had the power to become intangible and communicate with other dead people. 
{{spoiler}}
Along with the other members of X-Statix, she was killed in the series-ending issue #26. She would seem to have a better-than-average chance of coming back. Dead Girl was also the girlfriend of [[the Anarchist]].
