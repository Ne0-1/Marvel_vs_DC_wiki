'''Dead Girl (Moonbeam)''' is a [[fictional character]], a  [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[X-Statix]] series. She is a mixture of [[ghost]] and [[zombie]]. Her civilian name has never been fully revealed, but she admitted after some cajoling that her first name is/was "Moonbeam." Dead Girl's mutant gene allows her to return to semi-life after dying; she is also able to become intangible and communicate with other dead people. 

==Publication history==
Dead Girl starred in the [[mini-series]] ''[[X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl]]''. The series ran for five issues and focuses on a vengeful dead villain, [[The Pitiful One]], intent on gathering other residents of Hell - such as [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], [[Kraven (comics)|Kraven]], [[Mysterio]], The [[Ancient One]] and Dead Girl's previous teammate [[Anarchist (comics)|The Anarchist]] - to bring himself to life once more.

Dead Girl spoke of throughout the previous series.[http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=477ee74b4b4f2931147c2adbab56db2e&threadid=39976]

There has been some question as to whether the series is connected to the rest of Marvel continuity, and yet several intriguing things occur; among them is Dead Girl's pseudo-romantic involvement with Stephen Strange. She revealed in the fifth issue that her first name is Moonbeam. Eventually, she and her assembled team of heroes stop the Pitiful One.

==Fictional character history==
Dead Girl has few memories of when she was still alive; she believes she was a young actress who was murdered by her co-star/lover, who then sealed her body inside a [[mausoleum]]. The dead heard her cries and lured the killer back to the crypt in which he had buried her. Dead Girl awoke and took her revenge on him. Eventually, X-Force (soon to be renamed X-Statix) hired her and invited her to join them. 

Along with the other members of X-Statix, she was killed properly<ref>X-Statix #26</ref>. 

While in the afterlife,, she went up against a being called the Pitiful One who was intent on resurrecting him using the denizens of the afterlife to achieve this.  Only [[Doctor Strange]] and Dead Girl, with the aid of her dead friends, were able to stop them. In order to combat the Pitiful One's plans, Dead Girl and Strange enlist help from dead heroes sent to [[Heaven]], including [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man II]], the Phantom Rider and someone known as the Piano-Player; they also call on [[Mister Sensitive]] and [[U-Go Girl]], two of Dead Girl's former teammates. [[Peter Milligan]] writes, with [[Mike Allred]] on inks and cover art while [[Nick Dragotta]] provides the interior pencilling. Allred also pencils and inks the interior art for all the former X-Statix members that make appearances in the miniseries. A number of deceased Marvel characters make appearances, including [[Gwen Stacy]], [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Moira MacTaggart]] revealed as the "sisters" 

==Powers and abilities==
Physically deceased, her mutation triggered by death, Dead Girl can command any body part severed from her and rebuild her molecular structure from virtually any physical attack, regardless of how much damage or destruction she sustains, even if reduced to a skeleton. She can safely survive toxic conditions deadly to anyone else. She can also become intangible and walk on air, transform her hands into claws, and otherwise alter her body to an unclear extent. She can communicate telepathically with dead spirits either using their physical remains or on the astral plane and communicate with the cells, bacteria, and disintegrating tissue of corpses, temporarily resurrect the recently deceased as zombies or ghosts, and briefly summon images of deceased people from the minds of others. She has above-average strength and agility.
