'''Jessica Campbell Jones''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Marvel Universe]].  She originally debuted in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', as an embittered former [[superhero]] who used the pseudonym '''Jewel''' (among others), and then became the owner of Alias Private Investigations.  She was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]].  It is confirmed that she was created as a stand-in for the Jessica Drew [[Spider-Woman]] character, whom Bendis was not allowed to use for ''Alias''. Bendis has since developed her into a distinct character with a unique voice in the Marvel Universe.

Jessica Campbell was riding in a car with her family when they collided with a truck carrying radioactive chemicals.  Her family was killed and, after spending several months in a [[coma]], she was placed in foster care and adopted by the Jones family.  Some time later she discovered she had superpowers as a result of the accident, mainly super strength and flight.

Recently [[retcon]]ned into the Marvel Universe, "Jewel" was a new heroine (and possibly an associate member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]) until she was mind-controlled by the villainous Zebediah Killgrave, the [[Purple Man]].  Jessica was enslaved by the Purple Man for several months until a temper tantrum of his sent her out to fight [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] at the [[Avengers Mansion]].  As Daredevil is not an Avenger, she punched the first hero in a red costume she saw - the [[Scarlet Witch]].  The mind-control began to wear off and Jessica fled, but she received a severe beating at the hand of several Avengers, namely the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the latter nearly decapitating her with his hammer.  She remained in a coma for months, placed under the care of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and undergoing psychic therapy with [[Jean Grey]] of the [[X-Men]].  Jean placed a special mental command inside Jessica's subconscious that would protect her from ever being mind-controlled like that again.

Because of the intensely violating nature of her experience with Killgrave, combined with the fact that no one noticed she was missing for eight months, Jessica quit the hero business and opened a detective agency.  She specialized in cases involving people with superpowers, because of her experience and her connections in the superhero community.  

For a period of time Jessica dated Scott Lang (the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]], and a member of the Avengers).  She also had an off-and-on affair with [[Luke Cage]], which led to her becoming pregnant.  Following that, she retired from the detective business and joined the staff of the [[Daily Bugle]] as a superhero correspondent and consultant.  She and Luke are living together. Jessica is currently unaware that Luke's [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] teammate [[Spider-Man]] is Peter Parker, once her high school classmate and teenage crush.

Following the end of ''Alias'', Jessica is the main character of ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''.
