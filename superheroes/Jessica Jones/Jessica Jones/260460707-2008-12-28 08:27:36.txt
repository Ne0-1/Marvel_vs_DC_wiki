'''Jessica Campbell Jones''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]].  Jones debuted in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' as an embittered former [[superhero]] who had used the aliases '''Jewel''' and '''Knightress'''.  After hanging up her costume, she became the owner and sole employee of Alias Private Investigations.

==Publication history==
Jessica Jones debuted in the  [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]]-[[imprint]] series ''Alias'', (which bears no relation to the [[Alias (TV show)|TV program]] of the same name). The character and series were created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]]. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues from  2002 to 2004, with most covers drawn by [[David Mack]]. Jones and other characters from the series moved to Bendis' subsequent series, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''.

In a 2005 interview,<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5711 ''Comics Book Resources'' (August 5, 2005): "Spider-Love: Bendis on 'Spider-Woman: Origin' and New Ongoing Series", by Jonah Weiland]</ref> Bendis claimed that "[o]riginally, ''Alias'' was going to star Jessica Drew ([[Spider-Woman]]), but it became something else entirely. Which is good, because had we used Jessica it would have been off continuity and bad storytelling". Previously, Bendis commented, "I was at one time toying with doing Jessica Drew [in ''Alias''] because she has the best hair of any superhero in comics, but this book is entirely different than what that idea was to be."<ref>''Powers'' #11, letters pages</ref> Although both statements make clear that Drew was a part of Bendis' earliest conception of ''Alias,'' by the time he was actively developing the title, Jones was his central character, one with a distinct background and voice from Drew.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-61/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #61 (column of July 27, 2006), by Brian Cronin]</ref>

In a Marvel Comics [[podcast]] Bendis expressed his desire to incorporate Jones into the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel-universe]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/rss/podcasts/Ult_SM_100_Bendis.mp3 Marvel Comics podcast (date n.a.)]</ref> In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #106 she appears as a senior at [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Introduced in the Marvel Universe as a [[retcon]] character, Midtown High student Jessica Campbell was present when [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] was bitten by the irradiated [[spider]] that gave him his powers. She had a crush on him, and had just plucked up the courage to speak to him when he was distracted by the bite. She also had a celebrity crush on teen heart-throb [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]. 

Soon thereafter, Jessica was riding in a car with her family when they collided with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals.  Her family was killed and, after spending several months in a [[coma]], she was placed in foster care and adopted by the Jones family.  Months later she awoke, stirred by the first coming of Galactus outside her hospital room. 

Jessica later discovered that the radioactive materials she was exposed to in the accident had granted her super-strength, limited invulnerability, and flight (which she never fully mastered). The Joneses re-enrolled Jessica at Midtown High, where she was ostracized by her classmates, especially [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter Parker (who had since become Spider-Man) sensed in Jessica a kindred spirit &mdash; someone who had also lost family due to a tragic circumstance.  Jessica mistook his kind attention and lashed out at him, believing he was merely pitying her. At that time she found out she had super-powers.

===Heroic career===
[[Image:Aliasomnibus.PNG|200px|thumb|left|Promotional art for cover of ''Alias'' #28. Art by [[David Mack]] and [[Mark Bagley]].]]
As Jewel, Jones was an upstart heroine with a fairly uneventful career until she intervened in a disturbance at a restaurant involving longtime Daredevil foe Zebediah Killgrave, the [[Purple Man]].  Killgrave effortlessly placed Jones under his mental control, a situation that would continue for several months.  Though she wasn't sexually assaulted herself, Killgrave enslaved and humiliated Jones, forcing her to watch as he [[raped]] a succession of college coeds whom he had abducted and mind-controlled for his amusement. Killgrave also forced Jones to beg him to have sex with her, often until she broke down in tears, only to deny her, as a form of psychological abuse. After eight months under his control, Jones began to lose the distinction between his will and her own, developing a kind of [[Stockholm syndrome|Stockholm Syndrome]].

In the midst of a temper tantrum, the Purple Man sent Jones to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], erroneously directing her to the [[Avengers Mansion]].  Since Daredevil is not an Avenger, Jones attacked the first hero she saw there in a red costume &mdash; the [[Scarlet Witch]]. The mind-control began to wear off and Jones attempted to flee, but she was caught and received a severe beating at the hands of the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] (the Scarlet Witch's then-husband), and [[Iron Man|Iron Man]]. She escaped death due to the intervention of the only Avenger who actually knew her, [[Carol Danvers]], who took her to safety. 

Jones remained in a coma for months, under the care of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while also undergoing psychic therapy with [[Jean Grey]] of the [[X-Men]]. In addition to assisting her emergence from the coma, Grey placed a special mental command in Jones' subconscious that would protect her from further mind control. During this time Jones developed a doomed romantic relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Clay Quartermain]], who would prove to be a valuable friend and contact for her later in life.

The intensely violating nature of her experience with Killgrave, combined with the fact that no one noticed she had been missing for eight months, forced a demoralized Jones to give up being a costumed superhero.  

Jones tried being a superhero one final time before giving up, adopting a darker identity as the Knightress. Intercepting a crime meeting between the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]] and a [[mafioso]], she met up with fellow superhero [[Luke Cage]]. After defeating the Owl and his goons, she discovered that one of the thugs had brought his children with him. Jones took off her mask and revealed her identity to the cops so that they would allow her to look after the children for the night. Luke Cage went to her home later that night and the two had a long talk, the first step towards a lasting friendship.

===Private Eye===
{{main|Alias (comics)}}
Jones, now no longer a superhero, opens a private detective agency, and, given her background, was sought out by clients with superhero connections.  Despite her wishes to leave the superhero life, she finds herself repeatedly drawn back into it.  Longtime friend Carol Danvers set Jones up with Scott Lang (the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]), and the two date for several months. She also had an off-and-on affair with [[Luke Cage]].

Having escaped from high-security incarceration, Killgrave, obsessed with Jones, attempts to break her spirit by making her experience her worst nightmares &mdash; that she had walked in on both Lang and Cage in bed with her friend, Danvers. This time, however, the mental defenses Grey had given her allow Jones to free herself from his control. She knocks him out and he is recaptured.

Cage admits his strong feelings for Jones, and she reveals to Luke that she is pregnant with their child; he is elated and the two enter into a committed relationship.

===The Pulse===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cagehoenswed.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The wedding of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. Art by [[Olivier Coipel]].]] -->
{{main|The Pulse (comics)}}
Jones takes a leave from the detective business and joins the staff of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' as a superhero correspondent and consultant, becoming a main character of the comic book ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', and a contributor to the same-name fictional newspaper supplement within.  A pregnant Jones is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] after the ''Bugle'' reports that he is secretly industrialist Norman Osborn.  In response, Cage retaliates and Osborn is irrevocably exposed as the Goblin upon his defeat and incarceration.  Jones quits her job with the ''Bugle'' after publisher J. Jonah Jameson uses the paper to smear the New Avengers. Jones extracts payback by refusing the ''Bugle'' exclusive rights to cover her daughter's birth.

Jones and Cage are living together when she gives birth to their child, Danielle, whom they name after Luke's best friend, 
Danny Rand (a.k.a. [[Iron Fist]]). Cage proposes marriage, and Jones accepts.<ref>''The Pulse'' #14</ref>. The two are married by a priest with an uncanny resemblance to Marvel Comics publisher emeritus [[Stan Lee]] (a not uncommon occurrence in Marvel comics).<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #1</ref> Jones retained her [[Maiden name#Use maiden name|maiden name]].

===Civil War===
In Marvel's cross-over [[Civil War (comics)|''Civil War'']], Jones and Cage are confronted by [[Iron Man]] and [[Ms. Marvel]], who urge them to register with the authorities under the provisions of the Superhuman Registration Act.  When asked if they intend to sign up, neither actually says "no," though they make their intentions to defy the law very clear, with Luke going so far as to compare the Act to [[slavery]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow segregration]].  In order to keep their child safe, Jones travels with her to [[Canada]], while Luke stays in their home in Harlem.  Having eluded the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents dispatched to apprehend him, Cage joins [[Captain America]]'s "Secret Avengers."  Despite the surrender of Captain America at the conclusion of the ''Civil War'' crossover, Cage remains underground as leader of the New Avengers.

===Post-Civil War===
At the end of ''New Avengers'' #31, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] is killed and is revealed to have been a [[Skrull]]. In the next scene, unbeknownst to Jones, her baby's eyes flash yellow-green. Later, following an attack on Doctor Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] by the forces of the demonic villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], Jones, shaken by the experience and desperate to protect her child, leaves the New Avengers and goes with her baby to Stark Tower, to register under the Superhuman Registration Act, effectively ending her relationship with Luke Cage for the time being.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (Feb. 2008)</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #2, Jones is among the heroes who emerged from the crashed Skrull ship wearing her Jewel costume. The group of emerging heroes believe themselves to be the real ones, however it was shown that some of the group were Skrulls. This Jones, dressed as Jewel, is later revealed to be a Skrull.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5 (August. 2008)</ref> The Real Jessica Jones however, appeared in ''Secret Invasion'' #7, where she joined in the heroes fight against the Skrulls and was able to be reunited with her husband. After the Skrull surrender the Skrull impersonating Jarvis disappears with their daughter leaving Jessica desperate.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8 (December 2008)</ref>

===Dark Reign=== 
After Luke, Jessica and Carol arrive at Buckys home, the New Avengers, Fantastic Four and Iron Fist begin searching for Danielle. They attack various villains such as A.I.M., HYDRA, Electro and Red Skull for any information reguarding the Skrull Jarvis, thinking he might have contacted them for a way to escape New York City, possibly the earth. Eventually they find a Skrull pretending to be an ex-SHIELD agent at a bar. After a brief confrontation, the Skrull is about to reveal where Danielle is when another agent shoots the Skrull in the head, leaving Jessica convinced they are going to kill Danielle and unaware Luke asking Norman Osborn for help in their search.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48</ref>

==Powers and Abilities==
As a result of the chemical spill, Jessica Jones possesses superhuman strength and resistance to injury and the ability to fly at sub-sonic speeds. The exact limits of her strength and durability have not been defined, but she was able to lift a two-ton police car with apparent ease. She was not able to withstand a Venom Blast from [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], nor a severe beating by [[Iron Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Recently it seems that she finally was able to master her ability to fly. <ref>''New Avengers'' #48</ref>

Jessica was vulnerable to telepathic attack which led to her ordeal at the hands of the [[Purple Man]] until mental barriers were put in place by [[Jean Grey]] to grant her better resistance.

In addition to her superhuman powers, Jessica is a skilled detective and investigative journalist. <ref>''Alias'' #1-28</ref>

==Other versions==
[[Image:Ultjessicajones.PNG|thumb|Ultimate Jessica Jones.]]
===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]], Jessica is married to a man named Scott (Presumably Scott Lang, the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]).

===What If===
In [[What If (comics)#2005 series|''What If Jessica Jones Had Joined the Avengers?'']] Jones accepts Captain America's offer that she work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and, perceiving that something is amiss with Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch), she alerts the other Avengers, ensuring that the catastrophic events depicted in ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' and the ''[[House of M]]'' never occur.  Jessica marries [[Captain America]].

===Ultimate Jessica Jones===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #106, Jones appears as a senior student in the school [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] attends. She's the executive producer of the school's television network. She later becomes jealous of [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s better film skills. It's also stated that she may be at least suspicious of Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man, based off of Mary Jane's observations in ''Ultimate Spider-Man Annual'' #3.
