'''Jessica Campbell Jones Cage'''<ref>In ''New Avengers'' #50, she is called "Jessica Jones Cage" (no hyphen)</ref> is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]].  Jones debuted in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' as an embittered former [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]] who had used the aliases '''Jewel''' and '''Knightress'''. As she did not exist in the Marvel Universe prior to being created for the ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' series, she is a [[retcon]] character. After hanging up her costume, she became the owner and sole employee of Alias Private Investigations.

==Publication history==
Jessica Jones debuted in the  [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]]-[[imprint]] series ''Alias'', which bears no relation to the [[Alias (TV series)|TV program]] of the same name. The character and series were created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]]. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues from  2001 to 2004, with most covers drawn by [[David W. Mack]]. Jones and other characters from the series moved to Bendis' subsequent series, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''.

In a 2005 interview,<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5475 ''Comics Book Resources'' (August 5, 2005): "Spider-Love: Bendis on 'Spider-Woman: Origin' and New Ongoing Series", by Jonah Weiland]</ref> Bendis claimed that "[o]riginally, ''Alias'' was going to star Jessica Drew ([[Spider-Woman]]), but it became something else entirely. Which is good, because had we used Jessica it would have been off continuity and bad storytelling." Previously, Bendis commented, "I was at one time toying with doing Jessica Drew [in ''Alias''] because she has the best hair of any superhero in comics, but this book is entirely different than what that idea was to be."<ref>''Powers'' #11, letters pages</ref> Although both statements make clear that Drew was a part of Bendis' earliest conception of ''Alias,'' by the time he was actively developing the title, Jones was his central character, one with a distinct background and voice from Drew.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-61/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #61 (column of July 27, 2006), by Brian Cronin]</ref> Despite this, the character draws much from Drew, in terms of character history and experiences, and also has some similarities with the character of [[Carol Danvers]]; in some respects, she is something of a [[pastiche]] of the two women.

In a Marvel Comics [[podcast]] Bendis expressed his desire to incorporate Jones into the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/rss/podcasts/Ult_SM_100_Bendis.mp3 Marvel Comics podcast (date n.a.)]</ref> In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #106 she appears as a senior at [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Introduced in the Marvel Universe as a [[retcon]] character{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}, Midtown High student Jessica Campbell was present when [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] was bitten by the irradiated [[spider]] that gave him his powers. She had a crush on him, and had just plucked up the courage to speak to him when he was distracted by the bite. She also had a celebrity crush on teen heart-throb [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]. 

Soon thereafter, Jessica was riding in a car with her family when they collided with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals.  Her family was killed and, after spending several months in a [[coma]], she was placed in foster care and adopted by the Jones family.  Months later she awoke, stirred by the first coming of [[Galactus]] outside her hospital room. 

Jessica later discovered that the radioactive materials she was exposed to in the accident had granted her super strength, limited invulnerability, and flight (which she never fully mastered during her superhero career). The Joneses re-enrolled Jessica at Midtown High, where she was ostracized by her classmates, especially [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter Parker (who had since become Spider-Man) sensed in Jessica a kindred spirit &mdash; someone who had also lost family due to a tragic circumstance.  Jessica mistook his kind attention and lashed out at him, believing he was merely pitying her. At that time she found out she had superpowers.

===Heroic career===
[[Image:Aliasomnibus.PNG|200px|thumb|left|Promotional art for cover of ''Alias'' #28. Art by [[David W. Mack]] and [[Mark Bagley]].]]
As Jewel, Jones was an upstart heroine with a fairly uneventful career until she intervened in a disturbance at a restaurant involving longtime Daredevil foe Zebediah Killgrave, the [[Purple Man]].  Killgrave effortlessly placed Jones under his mental control, a situation that would continue for several months.  Though she wasn't sexually assaulted herself, Killgrave enslaved and humiliated Jones, forcing her to watch as he [[rape]]d a succession of college coeds whom he had abducted and mind-controlled for his amusement. Killgrave also forced Jones to beg him to have sex with her, often until she broke down in tears, only to deny her, as a form of psychological abuse. After eight months under his control, Jones began to lose the distinction between his will and her own, developing a kind of [[Stockholm syndrome|Stockholm Syndrome]].

In the midst of a temper tantrum, the Purple Man sent Jones to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], erroneously directing her to the [[Avengers Mansion]].  Since Daredevil is not an Avenger, Jones attacked the first hero she saw there in a red costume &mdash; the [[Scarlet Witch]]. The mind-control began to wear off and Jones attempted to flee, but she was caught and received a severe beating at the hands of the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] (the Scarlet Witch's then-husband), and [[Iron Man]]. She escaped death due to the intervention of the only Avenger who actually knew her, [[Carol Danvers]], who took her to safety. 

Jones remained in a coma for months, under the care of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while also undergoing psychic therapy with [[Jean Grey]] of the [[X-Men]]. In addition to assisting her emergence from the coma, Grey placed a special mental command in Jones' subconscious that would protect her from further mind control. During this time Jones developed a doomed romantic relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Clay Quartermain]], who would prove to be a valuable friend and contact for her later in life.

The intensely violating nature of her experience with Killgrave, combined with the fact that no one noticed she had been missing for eight months, forced a demoralized Jones to give up being a costumed superhero.  

Jones tried being a superhero one final time before giving up, adopting a darker identity as the Knightress. Intercepting a crime meeting between the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and a [[mafia|mafioso]], she met up with fellow superhero [[Luke Cage]]. After defeating the Owl and his goons, she discovered that one of the thugs had brought his children with him. Jones took off her mask and revealed her identity to the cops so that they would allow her to look after the children for the night. Luke Cage went to her home later that night and the two had a long talk, the first step towards a lasting friendship.

===Private Eye===
{{main|Alias (comics)}}
Jones, now no longer a superhero, opens a private detective agency, and, given her background, was sought out by clients with superhero connections.  Despite her wishes to leave the superhero life, she finds herself repeatedly drawn back into it.  Longtime friend Carol Danvers set Jones up with Scott Lang (the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]), and the two date for several months. She also had an off-and-on affair with [[Luke Cage]].

Having escaped from high-security incarceration, Killgrave, obsessed with Jones, attempts to break her spirit by making her experience her worst nightmares &mdash; that she had walked in on both Lang and Cage in bed with her friend, Danvers. This time, however, the mental defenses Grey had given her allow Jones to free herself from his control. She knocks him out and he is recaptured.

Cage admits his strong feelings for Jones, and she reveals to Luke that she is pregnant with their child; he is elated and the two enter into a committed relationship.

===The Pulse===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cagehoenswed.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The wedding of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. Art by [[Olivier Coipel]].]] -->
{{main|The Pulse (comics)}}
Jones takes a leave from the detective business and joins the staff of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' as a superhero correspondent and consultant, becoming a main character of the comic book ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', and a contributor to the same-name fictional newspaper supplement within.  A pregnant Jones is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] after the ''Bugle'' reports that he is secretly industrialist Norman Osborn.  In response, Cage retaliates and Osborn is irrevocably exposed as the Goblin upon his defeat and incarceration.  Jones quits her job with the ''Bugle'' after publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] uses the paper to smear the New Avengers. Jones extracts payback by refusing the ''Bugle'' exclusive rights to cover her daughter's birth.

Jones and Cage are living together when she gives birth to their child, Danielle, whom they name after Luke's best friend, 
Danny Rand (a.k.a. [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]). Cage proposes marriage, and Jones accepts.<ref>''The Pulse'' #14</ref> The two are married in ''New Avengers'' Annual #1.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #1</ref> Jones retained her [[Maiden name#Use maiden name|maiden name]].

===Civil War===
In Marvel's cross-over [[Civil War (comics)|''Civil War'']], Jones and Cage are confronted by [[Iron Man]] and [[Ms. Marvel]], who urge them to register with the authorities under the provisions of the Superhuman Registration Act.  When asked if they intend to sign up, neither actually says "no," though they make their intentions to defy the law very clear, with Luke going so far as to compare the Act to [[slavery]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow segregation]].  In order to keep their child safe, Jones travels with her to [[Canada]], while Luke stays in their home in Harlem.  Having eluded the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents dispatched to apprehend him, Cage joins [[Captain America]]'s "Secret Avengers."  Despite the surrender of Captain America at the conclusion of the ''Civil War'' crossover, Cage remains underground as leader of the New Avengers.

===Post-Civil War===
At the end of ''New Avengers'' #31, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] is killed and is revealed to have been a [[Skrull]]. In the next scene, unbeknownst to Jones, her baby's eyes flash yellow-green. Later, following an attack on Doctor Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] by the forces of the demonic villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], Jones, shaken by the experience and desperate to protect her child, leaves the New Avengers and goes with her baby to Stark Tower, to register under the Superhuman Registration Act, effectively ending her relationship with Luke Cage for the time being.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (Feb. 2008)</ref>

===Dark Reign===
Jessica, Luke, and Carol arrive at [[Bucky]]'s home.

Peter then tries to convince Jones to return to the life of a superhero.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #601 (October 2009)</ref><ref>The battle between Spider-Man and the Sandman occurred during the villain's first published appearance in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #4 (September 1963).</ref> She later takes his advice and assists the Avengers in rescuing Clint after being captured by Norman Osborn.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #3</ref>

===Heroic Age===

She and Luke begin searching for a nanny. Possible applicants were [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]], [[Echo (comics)|Echo]], [[Molly Hayes]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[She-Hulk]] and multiple others. Ultimately, [[Squirrel Girl]] is chosen as Danielle's nanny.<ref>''New Avengers'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of the chemical spill, Jessica Jones possesses superhuman strength and resistance to injury and the ability to fly at sub-sonic speeds. The exact limits of her strength and durability have not been defined, but she was able to lift a two-ton police car with apparent ease. She was not able to fully withstand a Venom Blast from [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]] nor a severe beating by [[Iron Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].

Jessica was vulnerable to telepathic attack which led to her ordeal at the hands of the [[Purple Man]] until mental barriers were put in place by [[Jean Grey]] to grant her better resistance.

In addition to her superhuman powers, Jessica is a skilled detective and investigative journalist.<ref>''Alias'' #1-28</ref>
