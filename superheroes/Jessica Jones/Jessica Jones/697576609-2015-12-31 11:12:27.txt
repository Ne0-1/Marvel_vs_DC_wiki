'''Jessica Campbell Jones Cage'''<ref>In ''New Avengers'' #50, she is called "Jessica Jones Cage" (no hyphen).</ref> is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]], the character first appeared in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #1 (November 2001) as a former superhero who became the owner and sole employee of Alias Private Investigations. Jones has since starred in two [[ongoing series]] (''Alias'' and ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''). Alongside her husband [[Luke Cage]], she became a member of the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] during Marvel's 2010 [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]] campaign. At various points in her history, Jones has used the aliases '''Jewel''', '''Knightress''', and '''Power Woman'''. [[Krysten Ritter]] portrays the character in the [[Netflix]] original series, ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]''.

== Publication history ==
Jessica Jones debuted in the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] series ''Alias'', which bears no relation to the [[Alias (TV series)|television series]] of the same name. The character and series were created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]]. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues from 2001 to 2004, with most covers drawn by [[David W. Mack]]. Jones and other characters from the series moved to Bendis's subsequent series, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''.

In a 2005 interview,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5475 | title=Spider-Love: Bendis on 'Spider-Woman: Origin' and New Ongoing Series | first=Jonah | last=Weiland |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=August 5, 2005 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Bendis claimed that "[o]riginally, ''Alias'' was going to star [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], but it became something else entirely. Which is good, because had we used Jessica, it would have been off continuity and bad storytelling." Previously, Bendis commented "I was at one time toying with doing Jessica Drew [in ''Alias''] because she has the best hair of any superhero in comics, but this book is entirely different than what that idea was to be."<ref>''Powers'' #11, letters pages</ref> By the time Bendis was actively developing the title, Jones was his central character, one with a distinct background and voice from Drew.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-61/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #61 | first=Brian | last=Cronin |publisher=Comic Book Resources| date=July 27, 2006 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>

Jessica Jones appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).

In a Marvel Comics [[podcast]], Bendis expressed his desire to incorporate Jones into the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marvel.com/rss/podcasts/Ult_SM_100_Bendis.mp3 | title=Marvel Comics podcast | date= | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #106, she appears as a senior at [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Origin ===
Midtown High student Jessica Campbell was present when [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] was bitten by the irradiated [[spider]] which gave him his powers. She had a crush on him, and had just plucked up the courage to speak to him when he was distracted by the bite. She also had a celebrity crush on teen heart-throb [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]].<ref name="auto">[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''Alias'' #22. Marvel Comics</ref>

Jessica's father received tickets for [[Disney World]] from his boss [[Tony Stark]]. On the way home, their car collided with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals. Her family was killed, and, after spending several months in a [[coma]], she awoke, stirred by the first coming of [[Galactus]] outside her hospital room. She was placed in an orphanage and adopted by the Jones family.<ref name="auto" />

Jessica later discovered that her radiation exposure granted her super strength, limited invulnerability, and flight (which she never fully mastered during her superhero career). Jessica's adoptive parents re-enrolled her at Midtown High, where she was ostracized by her classmates, especially [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter Parker (who had since become Spider-Man) sensed in Jessica a kindred spirit—someone who had also lost family due to a tragic circumstance. Jessica mistook his kind attention and lashed out at him, believing he was merely pitying her.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''Alias'' #23. Marvel Comics</ref>

She later witnessed a fight between Spider-Man and the villain [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] in her own class. This inspired her to use her abilities in a positive light.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #600 (2009). Marvel Comics</ref>

=== Heroic career ===
As Jewel, Jones was an upstart heroine with a fairly uneventful career until she intervened in a disturbance at a restaurant involving longtime [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] foe Zebediah Killgrave, the [[Purple Man]]. Killgrave used his power of [[mind control]] to place Jones under his command, psychologically torturing her and forcing her to aid his criminal schemes. After eight months, Jones began to lose the distinction between his will and her own.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''Alias'' #25. Marvel Comics</ref>

In the midst of a temper tantrum, the Purple Man sent Jones to kill Daredevil, erroneously directing her to the [[Avengers Mansion]]. Jones attacked the first hero she saw there in a red costume, the [[Scarlet Witch]]. The mind control began to wear off and Jones attempted to flee, but she was caught and severely injured by the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Iron Man]]. She escaped due to the intervention of [[Carol Danvers]], the only Avenger who actually knew her, who took her to safety.<ref name=A26>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #26. Marvel Comics</ref>

Jones remained in a coma for months, under the care of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while also undergoing psychic therapy with [[Jean Grey]] of the [[X-Men]]. In addition to assisting her emergence from the coma, Grey placed a special mental command in Jones's subconscious that would protect her from further mind control.<ref name=A28>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #28. Marvel Comics</ref> During this time, Jones developed a doomed romantic relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Clay Quartermain]], who would prove to be a valuable friend and contact for her later in life.<ref name=A26 />

The intensely violating nature of her experience with Killgrave, and the fact that she was barely noticed missing for eight months, prompted a demoralized Jones to give up her costumed superhero life.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #25–26</ref> In the final issue of ''The Pulse'', Jones tried being a superhero one final time, adopting a darker identity as the Knightress, before giving up. Intercepting a crime meeting between the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and a [[mafia|mafioso]], she met up with fellow superhero [[Luke Cage]]. After defeating the Owl and his goons, she discovered that one of the thugs had brought his children with him. Jones took off her mask and revealed her identity to the police so that they would allow her to look after the children for the night. Luke Cage went to her home later that night and the two had a long talk, the first step toward a lasting friendship.<ref name=Pulse14>''Pulse'' #14. Marvel Comics</ref>

=== Private eye ===
{{Main|Alias (comics)}}
Jones, no longer a superhero, opened a private detective agency. Given her background, she was sought out by clients with superhero connections. Despite her wish to leave the superhero life, she found herself repeatedly drawn back into it. Longtime friend Carol Danvers set Jones up with Scott Lang (the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]), and the two dated for several months. She also had an off-and-on affair with [[Luke Cage]].<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]''. Marvel Comics</ref>

Killgrave, still obsessed with Jones, escaped from high-security incarceration. He attempted to break her spirit by making her experience her worst nightmare: discovering Lang and Cage in a tryst with her friend, Danvers. This time, the mental defenses Grey had given her allowed Jones to free herself from his control. She knocked him out and he was recaptured.<ref name=A28 />

Later, Cage and Jones admitted their feelings for each other. After becoming pregnant with his child, Jones began a committed relationship with Cage.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''Alias'' #28. Marvel Comics</ref>

=== ''The Pulse'' ===
{{Main|The Pulse (comics)}}
Jones took a leave from the detective business and joined the staff of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' as a superhero correspondent and consultant, becoming a main character of the comic book ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', and a contributor to the same-name fictional newspaper supplement within. A pregnant Jones is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] after the ''Bugle'' reports that he is secretly industrialist Norman Osborn. In response, Cage retaliates and Osborn is irrevocably exposed as the Goblin upon his defeat and incarceration. Jones quits her job with the ''Bugle'' after publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] uses the paper to smear the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. Jones exacts payback by refusing the ''Bugle'' exclusive rights to cover her daughter's birth.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Jones and Cage are living together when she gives birth to their child, whom they name Danielle after Luke's best friend,
Danny Rand ([[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]).{{issue|date=December 2012}} Cage proposed marriage, and Jones accepted.<ref name=Pulse14 /> The two were married in ''New Avengers Annual'' #1.

Jonah Jameson]] regarding the emergence of a teen superhero team that seem to be mimicking the Avengers. Jones leaves the ''Bugle'' and is picked up by Iron Man and Captain America who explain more about the Young Avengers. Jones, Iron Man, Captain America and the Young Avengers are attacked by [[Kang the Conqueror]] who threatens [[Iron Lad]] by telling him that if he does not return to the future to become Kang, it will change history. Jessica realizes that she is in her Jewel costume and is not pregnant. Iron Lad leaves and this is reversed.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

Jessica, Captain America and Iron Man decide to tell the Young Avengers' parents about their children being superheroes. Jessica visits Peggy Lang, [[Stature (comics)|Cassie Lang's]] mother. Kat Farrell wishes to get an exclusive on the Young Avengers for the ''Daily Bugle'' and asks Jessica to locate and ask them if they will comply. Jessica visits all of the Young Avengers and learns about their lives before becoming superheroes and particularly connects with [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)]] who (it is implied) was raped. The team agrees to an interview and Jones continues to remain a supporting character until the series ends. She returns in ''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #6 in which she, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] attempt to defuse the situation between the Avengers and X-Men who are fighting over who gets to punish the [[Scarlet Witch]]. She helps fight [[Doctor Doom]] and is present when Stature and the [[Vision II]] are killed.

While moving in, Jessica spoke to the [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]] about what it's like to raise a child of superheroes and expressed both her support and annoyance at her husband's choice to start another team of Avengers.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

== Powers and abilities ==
After coming into contact with experimental chemicals and spending some time in a coma, Jessica emerged with superhuman abilities. She possesses superhuman strength, as well as flight, and is known to block mind control because of her strength. She shows the capability of lifting a two-ton police car with little apparent effort. Her strength allowed her to lift up a giant-sized Goliath by the nostrils and toss him a short distance, break Atlas's nose, and render her fellow superheroine Jessica Drew unconscious with a single punch to the face. She later withstood being punched by a human on Mutant Growth Hormone and suffered only mild bruising and a bloody nose, and was able to recover in moments after being shocked by Jessica Drew's venom blasts. Despite this resistance to harm, Jessica suffered severe injuries, including a damaged spine and neck, a detached retina, and a broken nose after being attacked by both the Vision and Iron Man.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #26. Marvel Comics</ref>

Jessica is also able to fly, and while she was able to fly quite well during her early years as a heroine, she has admitted that her flying ability degenerated while she was no longer an active hero. She has since displayed improved flying ability after joining the New Avengers.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

After her ordeal at the hands of the Purple Man, Jessica was given a degree of psionic protection by [[Jean Grey]] of the X-Men. This psionic protection was sufficient to protect Jessica against a second attack by the Purple Man, though she had to "trigger" this resistance on her own.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #28. Marvel Comics</ref>

In addition to her superhuman powers, Jessica is a skilled detective and investigative journalist.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #1–28. Marvel Comics</ref>

In the 2005 "[[House of M]]" [[fictional crossover|storyline]], Jessica is apparently dating Scott Lang.<ref>''House of M'' #6. Marvel Comics</ref>

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #106, Jones appears as a senior student in the school [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] attends. She is the executive producer of the school's television network. She later became jealous of [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s superior film skills. She attempted to deduce Spider-Man's secret identity for the school newspaper and may have been suspicious about Peter Parker. Later on after the events of ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'', she claimed to have abandoned her attempts on figuring out who Spider-Man was and instead wanted to focus on his heroics.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

In [[What If (comics)#Volume 3|''What If Jessica Jones Had Joined the Avengers?'' (Vol. 3, #1 [February, 2005])]], Jones accepts Captain America's offer to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Perceiving that something is amiss with Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch), she alerts the other Avengers, ensuring that the catastrophic events depicted in "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" and "[[House of M]]" never occur. Jessica marries [[Captain America]].
