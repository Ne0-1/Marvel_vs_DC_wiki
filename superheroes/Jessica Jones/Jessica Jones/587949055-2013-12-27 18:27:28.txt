'''Jessica Campbell Jones Cage'''<ref>In ''New Avengers'' #50, she is called "Jessica Jones Cage" (no hyphen).</ref> is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]], Jones debuted in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' as an embittered former [[superheroine]] who had used the aliases '''Jewel''', '''Knightress''', and '''Power Woman'''. After hanging up her costume, she became the owner and sole employee of Alias Private Investigations.

==Publication history==
Jessica Jones debuted in the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] [[imprint]] series ''Alias'', which bears no relation to the [[Alias (TV series)|television series]] of the same name. The character and series were created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]]. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues from 2001 to 2004, with most covers drawn by [[David W. Mack]]. Jones and other characters from the series moved to Bendis' subsequent series, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''.

In a 2005 interview,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5475 | title=Spider-Love: Bendis on 'Spider-Woman: Origin' and New Ongoing Series | first=Jonah | last=Weiland | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=August 5, 2005 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Bendis claimed that "[o]riginally, ''Alias'' was going to star [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], but it became something else entirely. Which is good, because had we used Jessica, it would have been off continuity and bad storytelling." Previously, Bendis commented, "I was at one time toying with doing Jessica Drew [in ''Alias''] because she has the best hair of any superhero in comics, but this book is entirely different than what that idea was to be."<ref>''Powers'' #11, letters pages</ref> Although both statements make clear that Drew was a part of Bendis' earliest conception of ''Alias'', by the time he was actively developing the title, Jones was his central character, one with a distinct background and voice from Drew.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-61/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #61 | first=Brian | last=Cronin | work=Comic Book Resources | date=July 27, 2006 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Despite this, the character draws much from Drew, in terms of character history and experiences, and also has some similarities with the character of [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]]; in some respects, she is something of a [[pastiche]] of the two women.{{Fact|date=December 2013}}

Jessica Jones appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013).

In a Marvel Comics [[podcast]], Bendis expressed his desire to incorporate Jones into the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.marvel.com/rss/podcasts/Ult_SM_100_Bendis.mp3 | title=Marvel Comics podcast | date= | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #106, she appears as a senior at [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school.

==Fictional character biography==
{{cleanup|section|reason=incompatible verb tenses, confused and confusing run-on sentences, unsourced claims|date=July 2013}}
===Origin===
Midtown High student Jessica Campbell was present when [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] was bitten by the irradiated [[spider]] that gave him his powers. She had a crush on him, and had just plucked up the courage to speak to him when he was distracted by the bite. She also had a celebrity crush on teen heart-throb [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]].

Soon thereafter, Jessica was riding in a car with her family when they collided with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals. Her family was killed and, after spending several months in a [[coma]], she was placed in foster care and adopted by the Jones family. Months later she awoke, stirred by the first coming of [[Galactus]] outside her hospital room.

Jessica later discovered that her radiation exposure granted her super strength, limited invulnerability, and flight (which she never fully mastered during her superhero career). The Joneses re-enrolled Jessica at Midtown High, where she was ostracized by her classmates, especially [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter Parker (who had since become Spider-Man) sensed in Jessica a kindred spirit — someone who had also lost family due to a tragic circumstance. Jessica mistook his kind attention and lashed out at him, believing he was merely pitying her.

She later witnessed a fight between Spider-Man and the villain [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] in her own class. This inspired her, in a way she cannot put into words, to use her abilities in a positive light.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #600 (2009)</ref>

===Heroic career===
As Jewel, Jones was an upstart heroine with a fairly uneventful career until she intervened in a disturbance at a restaurant involving longtime [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] foe Zebediah Killgrave, the [[Purple Man]]. Killgrave effortlessly placed Jones under his mental control, a situation that would continue for several months. Though she was not sexually assaulted herself, Killgrave enslaved and humiliated Jones, forcing her to watch as he [[rape]]d a succession of college coeds whom he had abducted and mind-controlled for his amusement. Killgrave also forced Jones to beg him to have sex with her, often until she broke down in tears, only to deny her, as a form of psychological abuse. After eight months under his control, Jones began to lose the distinction between his will and her own, developing a kind of [[Stockholm syndrome|Stockholm Syndrome]].<ref>''Alias'' #25</ref>

In the midst of a temper tantrum, the Purple Man sent Jones to kill Daredevil, erroneously directing her to the [[Avengers Mansion]]. Since Daredevil is not an Avenger, Jones attacked the first hero she saw there in a red costume — the [[Scarlet Witch]]. The mind-control began to wear off and Jones attempted to flee, but she was caught and received a severe beating at the hands of the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] (the Scarlet Witch's then-husband), and [[Iron Man]]. She escaped death due to the intervention of the only Avenger who actually knew her, [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]], who took her to safety.<ref>''Alias'' #26</ref>

Jones remained in a coma for months, under the care of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while also undergoing psychic therapy with [[Jean Grey]] of the [[X-Men]]. In addition to assisting her emergence from the coma, Grey placed a special mental command in Jones' subconscious that would protect her from further mind control.<ref>''Alias'' #28</ref> During this time Jones developed a doomed romantic relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Clay Quartermain]], who would prove to be a valuable friend and contact for her later in life.<ref>''Alias'' #26</ref>

The intensely violating nature of her experience with Killgrave, combined with the fact that no one noticed she had been missing for eight months, forced a demoralized Jones to give up being a costumed superhero.<ref>''Alias'' #25-26</ref>

In the final issue of ''The Pulse'', Jones tried being a superhero one final time before giving up, adopting a darker identity as the Knightress. Intercepting a crime meeting between the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and a [[mafia|mafioso]], she met up with fellow superhero [[Luke Cage]]. After defeating the Owl and his goons, she discovered that one of the thugs had brought his children with him. Jones took off her mask and revealed her identity to the cops so that they would allow her to look after the children for the night. Luke Cage went to her home later that night and the two had a long talk, the first step towards a lasting friendship.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Private eye===
{{Main|Alias (comics)}}
Jones, no longer a superhero, opened a private detective agency. Given her background, she was sought out by clients with superhero connections. Despite her wishes to leave the superhero life, she finds herself repeatedly drawn back into it. Longtime friend Carol Danvers set Jones up with Scott Lang (the second [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]), and the two dated for several months. She also had an off-and-on affair with [[Luke Cage]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Killgrave, still obsessed with Jones, escaped from high-security incarceration.  He attempted to break her spirit by making her experience her worst nightmare: discovering Lang and Cage in a tryst with her friend, Danvers. This time, the mental defenses Grey had given her allowed Jones to free herself from his control. She knocked him out and he was recaptured.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Cage and Jones admitted their feelings for each other.  After becoming pregnant with his child, Jones and Cage began a committed relationship.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Jones takes a leave from the detective business and joins the staff of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' as a superhero correspondent and consultant, becoming a main character of the comic book ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', and a contributor to the same-name fictional newspaper supplement within. A pregnant Jones is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] after the ''Bugle'' reports that he is secretly industrialist Norman Osborn. In response, Cage retaliates and Osborn is irrevocably exposed as the Goblin upon his defeat and incarceration. Jones quits her job with the ''Bugle'' after publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] uses the paper to smear the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. Jones extracts payback by refusing the ''Bugle'' exclusive rights to cover her daughter's birth.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Jones and Cage are living together when she gives birth to their child, Danielle, whom they name after Luke's best friend,
Danny Rand ([[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]).{{issue|date=December 2012}} Cage proposes marriage, and Jones accepts.<ref>''The Pulse'' #14</ref> The two are married in ''New Avengers Annual'' #1. Jones retained her [[Maiden name#Use maiden name|maiden name]].<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>

Jones, Iron Man, Cap and the Young Avengers are attacked by [[Kang the Conqueror]] who threatens [[Iron Lad]]  by telling him that if he does not return to the future to become Kang, it will change history and Jessica finds that she is in her Jewel costume and is not pregnant. Iron Lad leaves and this is reversed. Jessica, Cap and Iron Man decide to tell the Young Avenger`s parents about their children being superheroes and Jessica visits Peggy Lang, [[Stature (comics)|Cassie Lang`s]] mother. Kat Farrell wishes to get an exclusive on the Young Avengers for the Bugle and asks Jessica to locate and ask them if they will comply. Jessica visits all of the Young Avengers and finds out about their lives before becoming superheroes and particularly connects with [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Hawkeye]] who, it is implied, was raped. The team agrees to an interview and Jones continues to remain a supporting character until the series ends. She returns in Young Avengers the Children`s Crusade #6 where she, along with [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] attempt to diffuse the situation between the Avengers and X Men who are fighting over who gets to punish the [[Scarlet Witch]].

In the next scene, unbeknownst to Jones, her baby's eyes flash yellow-green.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Later, following an attack on Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum by the forces of the demonic villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], Jones, shaken by the experience and desperate to protect her child, leaves the New Avengers and goes with her baby to Stark Tower to register under the Superhuman Registration Act, effectively ending her relationship with Luke Cage for the time being.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (2008)</ref>
