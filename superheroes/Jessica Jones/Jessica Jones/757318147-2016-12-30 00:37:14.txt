'''Jessica Campbell Jones Cage'''<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1, #50 (April 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]], and she first appeared in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #1 (November 2001), a [[MAX (comics)|Max]] [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]. Within the context of Marvel's [[Marvel Universe|shared universe]], Jones is a former superhero who becomes the owner and sole employee of Alias Private Investigations. Bendis originally envisioned the series centered on [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], and only decided to create Jones once he noticed that the main character had a distinct voice and background that differentiated her from Drew.

Jones has since starred in three [[ongoing series]], ''Alias'', ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'' and ''[[Jessica Jones (comic book)|Jessica Jones]]''. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues before ending in 2004, while ''The Pulse'' ran for 14 issues from  April 2004 to May 2006. ''Jessica Jones'' debuted in October 2016. She became a member of the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], alongside her husband [[Luke Cage]], during Marvel's 2010 [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]] campaign. At various points in her history, she has used various aliases, including '''Jewel''', '''Knightress''', and '''Power Woman'''. The character has been adapted into various forms of media outside of comic books; in 2015, she made her live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] with the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', portrayed by [[Krysten Ritter]], and Ritter is set to reprise her role in ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''.

== Creation ==
Jessica Jones debuted in the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] series ''Alias'', in November 2001. The character and series were created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Michael Gaydos]]. ''Alias'' ran for 28 issues from 2001 to 2004, with most covers drawn by [[David W. Mack]]. After the end of the series, Jones and other characters from the series moved to Bendis' subsequent series, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''. In a 2005 interview,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5475 | title=Spider-Love: Bendis on 'Spider-Woman: Origin' and New Ongoing Series | first=Jonah | last=Weiland |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=August 5, 2005 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Bendis claimed:

<blockquote>
"Originally, ''Alias'' was going to star [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], but it became something else entirely. Which is good, because had we used Jessica, it would have been off continuity and bad storytelling." Previously, Bendis commented, "I was at one time toying with doing Jessica Drew [in ''Alias''] because she has the best hair of any superhero in comics, but this book is entirely different than what that idea was to be."<ref>''Powers'' #11, letters pages</ref>
</blockquote>
By the time Bendis was actively developing the title, Jones was his central character, one with a distinct background and voice from Drew's.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-61/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #61 | first=Brian | last=Cronin |publisher=Comic Book Resources| date=July 27, 2006 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>

Jessica Jones appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). In a [[Marvel Comics]] [[podcast]], Bendis expressed his desire to incorporate Jones into the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marvel.com/rss/podcasts/Ult_SM_100_Bendis.mp3 | title=Marvel Comics podcast | date= | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #106, she appears as a senior at [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Origin ===
Midtown High student Jessica Campbell goes to school with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and is present when he is bitten by the irradiated [[spider]] which gives her radioactive powers.<ref name="auto">[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w). ''Alias'' #22. Marvel Comics</ref> Jessica's father receives tickets for [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]] from his boss [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. On the way home, their car collides with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals. Her family is killed, and she spends several months in a coma. Upon waking, she is placed in an orphanage and adopted by the Jones family.<ref name="auto"/> Jessica later discovers that her radiation exposure granted her super strength, limited invulnerability, and flight (which she never fully mastered during her superhero career). Jessica's adoptive parents re-enroll her at Midtown High, where she is ostracized by her classmates, especially [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter Parker (who has since become [[Spider-Man]]) senses in Jessica a kindred spirit—someone who has also lost her family due to a tragic circumstance. Jessica mistakes his kind attention for pity and lashes out at him.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #23. Marvel Comics</ref> She later witnesses a fight between Spider-Man and the villain [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] in her school. This inspires her to use her abilities for positive ends.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600 (2009). Marvel Comics</ref>

In response, Cage retaliates and Osborn is irrevocably exposed as the Goblin upon his defeat and incarceration. Jones quits her job with the ''Bugle'' after publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] uses the paper to smear the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].

=== Recent years ===

During the storylines of Marvel's 2010 "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" branding campaign, Jessica, returned to her costumed identity of Jewel, became a member of the New Avengers when the title relaunched in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25081 | title=Jessica Jones is a New Avenger |publisher=Comic Book Resources| date=March 4, 2010}}</ref> She and Luke began searching for a nanny, interviewing characters featured from other comics set in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Ultimately, [[Squirrel Girl]] was chosen as Danielle's nanny.<ref>''New Avengers'' #7. Marvel Comics</ref> In ''New Avengers'' #8, Jessica took the name '''Power Woman''' to both honor her husband, Power Man (Luke Cage), and to be a role model for their daughter.<ref>''New Avengers'' #8. Marvel Comics</ref> However following several incidents revolving around Thule Society attacking Avengers Mansion,<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #15–16</ref> and Norman Osborn's threat,<ref>''New Avengers'' #24</ref> Jessica quit the team and went into hiding, realizing that it was too dangerous for Danielle to remain in Avengers Mansion due to the numerous potential threats.<ref>''New Avengers'' #24. Marvel Comics</ref>

Jessica later appeared as an ally to the Mighty Avengers team formed by Luke Cage. Jessica and Danielle lived in the apartment of the Gem Theater, which was serving as the Mighty Avenger's base of operations. She and Luke would later be confronted by the Superior Spider-Man and his Spider Robots, who offered her a place on a different type of Avengers team that was to be run by him. Jessica swiftly found a baby sitter for her child and refused before delivering a powerful punch to Spider-Man's face for his threat. The group was later backed up by She-Hulk and she and Jessica decided to go out for coffee. Jessica and Luke would later switch apartments with an old friend of Luke's named David Griffiths. While moving in, Jessica spoke to the [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]] about what it's like to raise a child of superheroes and expressed both her support and annoyance at her husband's choice to start another team of Avengers.

In October 2016, a new ongoing series featuring the character, titled ''[[Jessica Jones (comic book)|Jessica Jones]]'', began.

== Powers and abilities ==
After coming into contact with experimental chemicals and spending some time in a coma, Jessica emerged with superhuman abilities. She possesses superhuman strength, as well as flight, and is known to block mind control because of her strength. She shows the capacity to lift a two-ton police car with little apparent effort. Her strength allowed her to lift up a giant-sized Goliath by the nostrils and toss him a short distance, break Atlas's nose, and render her fellow superheroine Jessica Drew unconscious with a single punch to the face. She later withstood being punched by a human on Mutant Growth Hormone and suffered only mild bruising and a bloody nose, and was able to recover in moments after being shocked by Jessica Drew's venom blasts. Despite this resistance to harm, Jessica suffered severe injuries, including a damaged spine and neck, a detached retina, and a broken nose after being attacked by both the Vision and Iron Man.<ref name="A26"/>

Jessica is also able to fly, and while she was able to fly quite well during her early years as a heroine, she has admitted that her flying ability degenerated while she was no longer an active hero. She has since displayed improved flying ability after joining the New Avengers.{{issue|date=November 2015}}

After her ordeal at the hands of the Purple Man, Jessica was given a degree of psionic protection by [[Jean Grey]] of the X-Men. This psionic protection was sufficient to protect Jessica against a second attack by the Purple Man, though she had to "trigger" this resistance on her own.<ref name="A28"/>

In addition to her superhuman powers, Jessica is a skilled detective and investigative journalist.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Alias'' #1–28. Marvel Comics</ref>

== Other versions ==
[[File:Jessica Jones (Earth-1610).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ultimate Jessica Jones. Art by [[David Lafuente]].]]
Multiple versions of Jessica Jones have appeared in [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel's multiverse]]. In the 2005 "[[House of M]]" [[fictional crossover|storyline]], Jessica was apparently dating Scott Lang.<ref>''House of M'' #6. Marvel Comics</ref> 

In [[What If (comics)|What If]],<ref>''What If Jessica Jones Had Joined the Avengers?'' Vol. 3, #1, February, 2005</ref> Jones accepted Captain America's offer to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Perceiving that something was amiss with Wanda Maximoff (the Scarlet Witch), she alerted the other Avengers, ensuring that the catastrophic events depicted in "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" and "[[House of M]]" would never occur. Jessica married [[Captain America]]. 

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'',<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #106, Marvel Comics</ref> Jones appeared as a senior student in the school [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] attended. She was the executive producer of the school's television network. She later became jealous of [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s superior film skills. She attempted to deduce Spider-Man's secret identity for the school newspaper and may have been suspicious about Peter Parker. Later on after the events of ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]'', she claimed to have abandoned her attempts to figure out who Spider-Man was and instead wanted to focus on his heroics.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
