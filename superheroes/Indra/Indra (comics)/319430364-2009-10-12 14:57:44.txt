==Character Biography==
===Alpha Squadron===
[[Image:Indra1.jpg|left|frame|Indra using his powers.]]

'''Paras Gavaskar''' is an [[Demographics of India|Indian]] mutant teenager. After enrolling at the Xavier Institute, Gavaskar was assigned to [[Alpha Squadron (comics)|Alpha Squadron]], a training squad mentored by [[Northstar]]; he was a top achiever in his classes. Indra and his fellow team members [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], [[Rubbermaid (comics)|Rubbermaid]], [[Network (comics)|Network]] and [[Kidogo]] suffered a great loss when they were told that Northstar had been killed in the line of duty.  The Alpha Squadron was unaware of Northstar's resurrection. Following the assumed death of Northstar, [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] was their advisor.

===M-Day===
Following the events of [[House of M]], almost all of the Institute's students were [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]], which led to the dissolution of the school's training squads. Indra was one of only twenty-seven students not to have lost his mutant abilities.

He participated in Emma Frost's Battle Royale which determined who will train to be an X-Man. Later, forty-two of Indra's former classmates died when their bus was attacked by [[William Stryker]], an anti-mutant crusader.<ref>''New X-Men'' #23-24</ref>

===Quest for Magik===
Indra was captured by [[Belasco]] and was held in Limbo with most of the other students. When [[X-23]] orchestrated an attempt at escaping, Indra was beaten badly by the demon S'ym when the attack failed.<ref>''New X-Men (second series)'' #37</ref>

After returning home, Indra discovers that he is the youngest mutant on the planet, and may become the last mutant on the planet, excluding [[Franklin Richards]], [[Molly Hayes]], [[Tito Bohusk]] and (technically) the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], and the most likely to be targeted.

===Messiah Complex and Utopia===
When [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]] attacks the Institute, Surge leaps to the defense of Indra, Trance and Wolf Cub, protecting them from the beast.<ref>''New X-Men'' #46</ref>

Paras later relocates to San Francisco along with all the other X-Men.<ref>''X_Men: Manifest Destiny'' #2</ref> When the city goes into a state of chaos due to the anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements. Cyclops sends [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Danger Room#Sentience revealed|Danger]] to find any missing students, Paras being among them. Rogue finds some beaten H.A.M.M.E.R. agents and after absorbing their memories to see if they know where Paras is, it is revealed they attacked him when he was trying to go home to check on his friends. In self defense, he attacks them and knocks them out.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy #226</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Indra possesses retractable sectional armored plates that afford him with the ability to cover himself in armor.  His skin is indigo and his hair is red; he has a red [[Bindi (decoration)|bindi]]-like marking on his forehead, though this marking may be cosmetic and not part of his mutation.
