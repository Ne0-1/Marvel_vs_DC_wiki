'''Thog the Nether-Spawn, Overmaster of Sominus''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] from the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional world]] of Sominus who has clashed with the [[Man-Thing]].  He first appeared in [[Adventure into Fear]] #11, [[Steve Gerber]]'s first work for Marvel, illustrated by [[Val Mayerik]].  Gerber himself, along with Man-Thing, were integral in defeating Thog on [[Therea]] in his first attempt to take over the universe.  [[Chris Claremont]], in the form of [[Man-Thing]], defeated him in his second.

Some commentators have noted that Thog is modest enough to wear shorts.  This is only the case in his subsequent appearances.  In his first appearance, he was initially batlike, and when harmed by Man-Thing, he took on a more human form, and only shadows and angle choices protected his modesty.

Contrary to some accounts, Thog is neither Satan nor Mephisto.
