==Fictional character biography==
Thog the Nether-Spawn is a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] from the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional world]] of Sominus who has clashed with the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Fear'' #11, 13; ''The Man-Thing'' #1, 21, 22, (vol. 2) #11</ref>

Gerber himself, along with Man-Thing, were integral in defeating Thog on [[Therea]] in his first attempt to take over the universe.<ref>''The Man-Thing'' #22</ref> [[Chris Claremont]], in the form of [[Man-Thing]], defeated him in his second.<ref>''The Man-Thing'' (vol. 2) #11</ref>

Some commentators have noted that Thog is modest enough to wear shorts.  This is only the case in his subsequent appearances.  In his first appearance, he was initially batlike, and when harmed by Man-Thing, he took on a more human form, and only shadows and angle choices protected his modesty.<ref>''Fear'' #11</ref>

Thog, along with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]], were alleged to be  manifestations of Satan's evil and power, however he is autonomous from said beings with a unique appearance, personality and traits.<ref>''Defenders'' V1 #100</ref>
