'''Professor Pyg''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]] and an enemy of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].  He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and first appeared in [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] #666. He is a regular character in the [[Batman and Robin (comic book)|''Batman and Robin'']] series. His real name is revealed in ''Batman and Robin'' #3 to be '''Lazlo Valentin''' a low rent "extreme" circus boss.

==Character overview==
Pyg has an obsession with making people "perfect", which he accomplishes by transforming them into Dollotrons, a process that bonds false "doll" faces to their own, presumably permanently. Professor Pyg uses cordless drills, hammers and icepicks along with the "doll" faces in the process of converting his victims into Dollotrons. It appears the operations he performs involve brain surgery or a form of lobotomization and possible gender realignment. Behind his mask he is a middle-aged Caucasian male. He wears a simple pig mask and is often depicted wearing a makeshift surgical outfit.

Morrison describes the character as "one of the weirdest, most insane characters that's ever been in Batman. We hear a lot about Batman facing crazy villains but we tried to make this guy seem genuinely disturbed and disconnected."<ref>http://au.comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p2.html</ref>
The character name is a shortened form of [[Pygmalion]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Fictional character biography==
In ''Batman and Robin'' issue 2 he proclaims the "Year of the Pig" at the end of the issue as his minions capture [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] ([[Damian Wayne]]).

It is revealed in issue 3 of ''Batman and Robin'' that Pyg was attempting to release an addictive identity destroying drug in the form of a virus into Gotham through infected Dollotrons. He initially sold the drug/virus to gangs who were using it to control prostitutes. Finally realising its potential he intended to hold the city to ransom. His plan is foiled when Batman having extracted his whereabouts from Phosphorous Rex confronts him at his hideout. Batman arrives at Pyg's disused [[fun fair]] hideout to discover Robin, who has previously run off after an argument, there too. Robin having just escaped from Pyg's efforts to convert him into another Dollotron works with Batman in subduing Pyg. Pyg is arrested and taken to Arkham Asylum where he currently resides.  

He allies himself with the [[Circus of the Strange]], including Mr. Toad, Phosphorous Rex, Big Top and Siam.

Several years later he is found by the police without his mask and crucified.
