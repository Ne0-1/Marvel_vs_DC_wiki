'''''Professor Pyg''''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]] and an enemy of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].  He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and first appeared in a cameo in [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] #666 (July 2007). He is a regular character in the [[Batman and Robin (comic book)|''Batman and Robin'']] series. His real name is revealed in ''Batman and Robin'' #3 to be '''Lazlo Valentin''', a low rent "extreme" circus boss.

==Character overview==
Lazlo Valentin, also known as Professor Pyg, is an obese, [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] man who has an obsession with making people "perfect", which he accomplishes by transforming his victims into ''Dollotrons'', a process that bonds "doll" faces to their own. Professor Pyg is depicted using cordless drills, hammers and icepicks to perform some sort of surgery on his victims. It appears the operations involve brain surgery or a form of vasectomy and possible gender reassignment, seemingly only male to female as Dollotrons resemble dolls of young girls. All the Dollotrons wear doll-like dresses. Attempts to reverse the Dollotron procedure have so far been unsuccessful appearing to result in death, or at least severe and permanent psychological and physical disfigurement of the patient.

Professor Pyg wears a simple pig mask and is often depicted wearing a makeshift surgical outfit. He is frequently shown with a "mother" figure made largely of barbed wire, a reference to psychologist [[Harry Harlow]]'s research with false monkey mothers. Pyg is very dependent on his "mother", which probably has ties to his past and maybe his desire to create the Dollotrons - grotesque versions of idealised young girls. Professor Pyg uses an unidentified mind-control drug, which could be spread like an infection across Gotham City, driving people mad. It is revealed that this drug infection is a part of a plan of Pyg to convert more people into Dollotrons.

Beside his growing army of zombie-like Dollotrons, Professor Pyg is also the leader of a low rent "extreme" circus known as the [[Circus of the Strange]], turned into a freakish criminal gang with members like Mr. Toad, Phosphorous Rex, Big Top and Siam. Professor Pyg is a partner-in-crime with Dr. [[Simon Hurt]], and is seen aiding him and his allies, the Black Glove and 99 Fiends, in their campaign against Batman. However, Pyg is more concerned in his own plans of making people perfect. It is evident that the number of Pyg's victims is well over a few hundred. 

Professor Pyg is claimed to redefine the word "wrong". He is a mad scientist and schizophrenic artist, also possessing the characteristics of sadist, narcissist, masochist, drug addict and sexual deviant. Pyg likes performing in public, usually dancing and stripping his clothes off. Morrison describes the character as "one of the weirdest, most insane characters that's ever been in Batman. We hear a lot about Batman facing crazy villains but we tried to make this guy seem genuinely disturbed and disconnected".<ref>http://au.comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p2.html</ref> The character name appears to be a shortened form of [[Pygmalion]] which could be a reference to his desire to transform people into an idealised state. Despite his non-canon cameo in Batman #666, Professor Pyg's face without his mask is never completely seen, probably due to his own claim that his mask is his true face.

Professor Pyg has a catch phrase: "You need a bad operation.", which he uses in response to his victims efforts to stop, insult or resist him.

==Fictional character biography==
===Circus of the Strange===
Pyg proclaims the "Year of the Pig", as he and his Circus of the Strange appear in Gotham City as part of the plan by Dr. Hurt. Pyg starts the campaign of making people "perfect", while his minions capture [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] ([[Damian Wayne]]).<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #2 (September 2009)</ref>

Pyg attempts to release an addictive identity destroying drug in the form of a virus into Gotham through infected Dollotrons. He initially sold the drug/virus to gangs who were using it to control prostitutes. His plan is foiled when Batman, having extracted his whereabouts from Phosphorous Rex, is heading to stop him and save Robin. Batman arrives at Pyg's disused [[fun fair]] hideout (previously used by the Joker), where Robin had just escaped from Pyg's efforts to convert him into another Dollotron. Together with Batman, they succeed in subduing Pyg and his Circus of the Strange, with all the Dollotrons seemingly captured.

===Black Glove===
He is arrested and taken to Blackgate Penitentiary. However, he is later freed by Simon Hurt's enforcers, the 99 Fiends gang, and is given a new mask in place of the one he lost. Being a major part of the plan created by Hurt and the Black Glove, Pyg is to wreak madness and havoc across Gotham with his currently spreading viral infection. At the same time, both Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] are captured when 99 Fiends attacks them, and a giant army of Dollotrons appears out of nowhere. Batman breaks free, while Pyg is aiming to perform his surgery on Gordon as a part of his performance to the Black Glove, at a "party" held at Crime Alley. This "party" is foiled by both Batman and the Joker (who has Robin captured), who is revealed to be Dr. Hurt's opponent. With the Black Glove terminated by Joker's laughing gas, Pyg and Hurt are nearly captured by Batman, only to subdue him with the help of a drugged Gordon.

Later, Robin (Damian Wayne), is freed by the Joker as a part of a plan to stop Dr. Hurt. Robin assaults Pyg's personal van and liberates Gordon, only to be caught by 99 Fiends. At this point, Pyg leaves Hurt and his 99 Fiends, and is heading to complete his own agenda in the city. Batman and Robin's fight against Simon Hurt, who impersonates Thomas Wayne, is nearly lost, but everything changes with the arrival of the original Batman, Bruce Wayne. While Bruce Wayne is dealing with Simon Hurt, he sends both Damian and Dick Grayson (the current Batman) to stop Pyg.

Professor Pyg is seen in the center of the drug infection, surrounded by his Dollotrons and the numerous addicts. He is performing on the makeshift, bizarre mobile "scene" (which is reminiscent of the one the Joker (played by [[Jack Nicholson]]) used in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Batman (1989 film)]]). Behind the scene is a "box" which he promotes, claiming to the maddened crowd that he has the salvation, the drugs which will take away the pain, and the masks which take away everything else. The "box" appears to be mobile Dollotron converter, as numerous people are seen entering it from the one side, only emerging as Dollotrons from the other. Dick and Damian succeeds in defeating Pyg, luring him out of the crowd by tricking him with his "mother". He is captured and is taken to Arkham Asylum.

===Possible Future===
In the future depicted in non-canon Batman #666, Professor Pyg and some members of the Circus of the Strange have become prominent criminal bosses in Gotham City. He is found dead by the police, without his mask and crucified upside down in a church. A very special Dollotron is also seen, much improved from what is seen in his other appearances.

==The Dollotrons==
The '''''Dollotrons''''' are Professor Pyg's personal army of zombie-like, brain-damaged people. They all wear doll-like dresses and have bag-like doll faces permanently attached to them (which couldn't be removed surgically). The process of creating them is not fully revealed, but it is implied it might be involving some kind of brain surgery, genital mutilation, and probably the mind-altering drugs Pyg uses. The doll mask is grafted using some kind of boiling liquid or drug.

The number of Dollotrons are unknown. While initially believed to be all defeated with Professor Pyg's first capture, even more of them later comes out of nowhere to confront Batman. It appears that there are literally hundreds of them already created. Pyg's overall goal is to make all people "perfect", and the infection he spreads around the city is only a part of this plan.

Two notable Dollotrons appear in the series. The first one is '''''Scarlet''''', a Russian girl that has a doll face attached to her, but as Pyg is stopped before other surgeries are performed, she remains sane and later joins the Red Hood as his side-kick. She later leaves Gotham City, being scared and tired of all that happened, with her mask slowly wearing off. The second one is a non-canon Dollotron appearing in the future, in Batman #666. It is much improved compared to other ones, and actually resembles a living moving doll. It is also more powerful and agile.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Professor Pyg makes a quick one-shot cameo appearance along with Flamingo in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Knights of Tomorrow!". He is shown being defeated by the future [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]].
