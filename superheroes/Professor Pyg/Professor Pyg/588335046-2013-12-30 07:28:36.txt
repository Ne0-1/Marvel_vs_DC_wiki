'''''Professor Pyg''''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]] and an enemy of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].  He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and first appeared in a cameo in [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] #666 (July 2007). He is a regular character in the [[Batman and Robin (comic book)|''Batman and Robin'']] series. His real name is revealed in ''Batman and Robin'' #3 to be '''Lazlo Valentin''', a low-rent "extreme" circus boss.

==Character overview==
===Inspirations===
Morrison describes the character as "one of the weirdest, most insane characters that's ever been in Batman. We hear a lot about Batman facing crazy villains but we tried to make this guy seem genuinely disturbed and disconnected".<ref>http://au.comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p2.html</ref> 

Grant Morrison's main inspirations for the character came from the song "Pygmalism", written by [[Momus (artist)|Momus]] for [[Kahimi Karie]].  Both the song and character are references to the play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', reflected in the character's desire to transform people into an idealized state.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/060904-Grant-Batman.html</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
[[Batman]] ([[Bruce Wayne]]) first learned about Professor Pyg when he captured his minion [[Mister Toad (comics)|Mister Toad]].<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #1</ref> Pyg proclaims the "Year of the Pig", and he and his [[Circus of Strange]] appear in Gotham City as part of the plan by [[Dr. Hurt]]. Pyg starts a campaign to make people "perfect", and his minions capture [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] ([[Damian Wayne]]).<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #2 (September 2009)</ref>

Pyg attempts to release an addictive identity-destroying drug in the form of a virus, using his Dollotrons â€” genderless lobotomized humans with special masks fused into their faces. He previously sold the drug to gangs, who used it to control prostitutes.  Pyg also plans to convert Robin into another Dollotron. He is foiled by Batman, who obtained Pyg's location from Pyg's captured henchman, Phosphorus Rex. Batman arrives at Pyg's disused [[fun fair]] hideout (previously used by the Joker in ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'') after Robin escapes from Pyg's clutches. Together, they succeed in subduing Pyg and his Circus of Strange, and they capture most of the Dollotrons.

Pyg is arrested and taken to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]. He is later freed by Simon Hurt's enforcers, the 99 Fiends Gang. A major part of the plan by Hurt and the [[Black Glove]], Pyg is to wreak madness and havoc across Gotham with his viral infection. Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] are captured by the 99 Fiends Gang, and a giant army of Dollotrons appears. Batman breaks free, but Pyg plans to convert Gordon at a "party" held in Crime Alley. The plan is foiled by Batman and [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] (who has captured Robin); Joker is revealed to be Dr. Hurt's adversary. The Black Glove is terminated with Joker's laughing gas. Pyg and Hurt are nearly captured by Batman, but they subdue him using the drugged Gordon.

Robin is freed by the Joker as a part of a plan to stop Dr. Hurt. Robin assaults Pyg's van and liberates Gordon, but he is captured by the 99 Fiends Gang. Pyg leaves Hurt and his 99 Fiends to pursue his own agenda in the city. Simon Hurt impersonates Thomas Wayne, and he nearly defeats Batman and Robin until [[Bruce Wayne]] arrives as the original Batman. Wayne remains to fight Simon Hurt, and he sends Robin and Grayson after Pyg.

Professor Pyg is at the center of the virus infection zone, surrounded by Dollotrons and numerous addicts. He is using a device that he claims will bring the addicts "salvation"; the device is a mobile Dollotron converter. Grayson and Robin defeat Pyg, luring him out of the crowd by tricking him with his "mother".{{clarify|date=October 2013}} He is taken to [[Arkham Asylum]].

A new villain named Son of Pyg briefly appears as an agent of the Leviathan organization. He is defeated by [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl]] during a plot to turn a group of teen mercenaries-in-training into agents of Leviathan.<ref>''Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes'' #1</ref> His real name is revealed to be Janosz Valentin aka "Johnny Valentine". <ref>Batman, Incorporated #4 </ref>

In ''[[The New 52]]'', Professor Pyg appears as part of a group of Arkham Asylum inmates who attempt to escape from the facility during a riot, but are stopped by Batman and Nightwing.<ref>''Batman'' vol. 2 #1</ref>

Batman discovers that Pyg's "Mother of Nails" is [[Talia al Ghul]].<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' vol. 2 #2-3</ref>

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] approaches Professor Pyg at Gotham Memorial Hospital to see if he will give his supplies and Doll-O-Trons to Scarecrow's followers. Bane later approaches Professor Pyg and forces him to join his cause.<ref>''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Professor Pyg is a gifted scientist and noted chemist.

==Other versions==
===Batman in Bethlehem===
In a possible future depicted in ''Batman'' #666, Professor Pyg and some members of the Circus of Strange have become prominent criminal bosses in Gotham City. He is found dead by the police without his mask, crucified upside down in a church. A special Dollotron is also seen, an improvement on the older models.

==The Dollotrons==
The Dollotrons are Professor Pyg's army of robotic mind-controlled people. They wear doll-like dresses and have doll masks permanently attached to their original faces.  The masks cannot be removed surgically. The process of creating them is not described in detail, but it is implied it involves brain surgery, genital mutilation, and mind-altering drugs.

They number in the hundreds, and can appear suddenly when Pyg is around.

The most notable Dollotron is Scarlet, the daughter of one of Pyg's Russian victims. Pyg was prevented from completing her transformation, and she remains sane.  She later joins the [[Red Hood]] as his side-kick. She becomes disgusted with Red Hood and leaves [[Gotham City]]. Her mask eventually wears off by itself, but there may be lasting damage.
