'''George Washington "G.W." Bridge''' is the name of a [[fiction|fictional]] character, appearing in [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a former mercenary and a high-ranking agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Currently he's leader of the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]]. He first appeared as an antagonist in ''[[X-Force]]'' #1, created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Rob Liefeld]]. 

==History==
Little is known about George Washington Bridge's early youth. He prefers to call himself "G.W." to avoid any jokes about the [[George Washington Bridge]]. Years ago, G.W. was a highly skilled mercenary, part of the [[Six Pack (comics)|Wild Pack]], a group of mercenaries gathered by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Other members included [[Grizzly (comics)|Theodore Winchester (Grizzly)]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Garrison Kane]] and Eugene Eisenhower "Ike" Canty (Hammer). After several successful missions, the Wild Pack was hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]], an arms dealer, under the condition that they changed their name; agents from [[Silver Sable]] had let them know that the name "Wild Pack" was taken. The team renamed itself [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] and went on the mission. The mission turned out to be disastrous: They encountered [[Stryfe]], Cable's archenemy. Cable left the team to pursue his own vendetta, shooting Hammer and sacrificing Kane. Bridge, Domino and Grizzly managed to escape. Kane and Hammer survived, but were heavily injured. Hammer would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, while Kane would receive cybernetic replacements for the arms he lost.

Bridge joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and worked his way up to [[Commander]]. When Cable joined the [[New Mutants]] and turned them into [[X-Force]], S.H.I.E.L.D. asked Bridge to investigate the team. Despite the grudge Bridge carried against Cable, he still felt that he owed Cable a warning, but it was ignored. Working with the Canadian '''Department K''', Bridge formed Weapon P.R.I.M.E., a group of superbeings who all carried a grudge against Cable. Weapon P.R.I.M.E. included Garrison Kane, now known as [[Weapon X]], Grizzly, [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]], Yeti (originally identified as [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo)]] and Tygerstryke. They attacked X-Force, but found out that Cable had just left the team. Unwilling to fight his former teammates, Rictor joined X-Force. Also, Tygerstryke was wounded during the fight and the team fell apart. 

G.W. Bridge returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. duty. He met with Cable shortly afterwards and after a short fight, the two made peace. Over the next few years, Bridge would inform Cable and his allies in X-Force and the [[X-Men]] on any [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]]-related problems S.H.I.E.L.D. encountered. Bridge warned Cable about [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]. When Cable's mutant powers began to dramatically increase, Bridge started to distrust Cable again and formed a new Six Pack, this time funded by S.H.I.E.L.D. to investigate Cable. Cable defeated the Six Pack and convinced several members to take his side, but not Bridge. Shortly afterwards, Cable was defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]].

{{spoilers}}
Bridge and Domino reappear as they are hired again as mercenaries. Apparently Bridge has left S.H.I.E.L.D<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #27</ref>.

Most recently, Bridge returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. action at the request of Jasper Sitwell, looking drastically different physically. He was contracted to take down Frank Castle, the [[Punisher]]. However, G.W. was unsuccessful in apprehending the Punisher, despite cornering him in close quarters. In light of these events, Bridge has resigned from active S.H.I.E.L.D. status because he believes that he will never have the freedom under S.H.I.E.L.D. command to use necessary force to take Frank Castle into custody. He has been immediately re-hired by Sitwell as an independent contractor, feeling this move will give him the proper ability to use whatever means necessary<ref> Punisher War Journal #1</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
G.W. Bridge has no superhuman powers, but is trained in hand-to-hand combat, the use of firearms and is a great strategist. As a high-ranking member of S.H.I.E.L.D. he has contacts all over the world and has access to advanced technology and classified information.

==Alternate versions==
As recently revealed in the MC2 miniseries [[Last Planet Standing]], G.W. Bridge has become the first black President of the United States of that universe. He holds a close relationship to the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] as a link with A-Next, a future generation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

==In other media==
G.W. Bridge appears with War Machine in [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' Animated series]] in a cameo.  They're shown watching a conference dealing with a virus that mutants are supposedly responsible for, in the episode ''Time Fugitive Part 1''.
