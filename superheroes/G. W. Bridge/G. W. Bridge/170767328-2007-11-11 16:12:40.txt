'''George Washington "G.W." Bridge''' is a [[fiction]]al character, appearing in [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a former mercenary and a high-ranking agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Currently he is the leader of the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]]. He first appeared as an antagonist in ''[[X-Force]]'' vol. 1 #1, created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Rob Liefeld]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about George Washington Bridge's early youth. He prefers to call himself "G.W." to avoid any jokes about the [[George Washington Bridge]]. Years ago, G.W. was a highly skilled mercenary, part of the [[Six Pack (comics)|Wild Pack]], a group of mercenaries gathered by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. Other members included [[Grizzly (comics)|Theodore Winchester (Grizzly)]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Garrison Kane]] and Eugene Eisenhower "Ike" Canty (Hammer). In one mission, Bridge and the others experienced Cable's teleportion technology, a beneficial but shocking surprise. After several successful missions, the Wild Pack was hired by [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]], an arms dealer, under the condition that they changed their name; agents from [[Silver Sable]] had let them know that the name "Wild Pack" was taken. The team renamed itself [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] and went on the mission. The mission turned out to be disastrous; they encountered [[Stryfe]], Cable's archenemy. Cable shot Hammer in order to prevent Hammer from surrendering vital intelligence. Cable left via futuristic technology that was unable to carry the other members of the team. This act convinced Six Pack that Cable purposely abandoned them.  In the ensuing destruction, Kane lost both of his arms. Bridge, Domino and Grizzly managed to escape. Kane and Hammer survived, but were heavily injured. Hammer would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, while Kane would receive cybernetic replacements for the arms he lost.

===Joining SHIELD===

Bridge joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and worked his way up to [[Commander]]. When Cable joined the [[New Mutants]] and turned them into [[X-Force]], S.H.I.E.L.D. asked Bridge to investigate the team. Despite the grudge Bridge carries against Cable, he still felt that he owed Cable a warning, but it was ignored. Working with the Canadian '''Department K''', Bridge formed Weapon P.R.I.M.E., a group of superbeings who all carried a grudge against Cable. Weapon P.R.I.M.E. included Garrison Kane, now known as [[Weapon X]], Grizzly, [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]], Yeti (originally identified as [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]) and Tygerstryke. They attacked X-Force, but found out that Cable had just left the team. Unwilling to fight his former teammates, Rictor joined X-Force. Also, Tygerstryke was wounded during the fight and the team falls apart. 

While still recovering from the Weapon P.R.I.M.E. battle, Bridge traveled to Department K in Canada. He met with its leader, Jeremey Clarke, who would ironically turn out to be a villainous madman himself. At the time, Clarke was supervising [[Garrison Kane]], who was training with his new arms. Bridge gave Kane vital information for a mission to bring Cable down. Kane believed Cable '''was''' Stryfe, but was unaware that Stryfe was Cable's clone at the time. This mission would end with Kane making peace with Cable.

G.W. Bridge returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. duty. He met with Cable shortly afterwards and after a short fight, the two made peace. Over the next few years, Bridge would inform Cable and his allies in X-Force and the [[X-Men]] on any [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]]-related problems S.H.I.E.L.D. encountered. 

Bridge warned Cable about [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]. Bridge  unofficially hired Domino to check in on [[Danielle Moonstar]], a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who had gone undercover inside a mutant terrorist group. Her position was threatened by a Zero Tolerance operation.

===Versus Cable Again===
When Cable's mutant powers begin to increase dramatically, Bridge starts to distrust Cable again and forms a new Six Pack, this time funded by S.H.I.E.L.D. to investigate Cable. Cable defeats the Six Pack and convinced several members to take his side, but not Bridge. Shortly afterwards, Cable is defeated by the [[Silver Surfer]].

Bridge and Domino reappeared when they were hired again as mercenaries. Apparently Bridge had left S.H.I.E.L.D<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #27</ref>.

Most recently, Bridge returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. action at the request of [[Jasper Sitwell]], looking drastically different physically. He also has converted to [[Islam]]. He is contracted to take down Frank Castle, the [[Punisher]]. However, G.W. was unsuccessful in apprehending the Punisher, despite cornering him in close quarters. In light of these events, Bridge  resigned from active S.H.I.E.L.D. status because he believed that he will never have the freedom under S.H.I.E.L.D. command to use necessary force to take Frank Castle into custody. He was immediately re-hired by Sitwell as an independent contractor, feeling this move will give him the proper ability to use whatever means necessary<ref> Punisher War Journal #1</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
G.W. Bridge has no superhuman powers, but is trained in hand-to-hand combat, the use of firearms and is a great strategist. As a high-ranking member of S.H.I.E.L.D. he has contacts all over the world and has access to advanced technology and classified information.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] continuity, G.W. Bridge has become the first black President of the United States of that universe. He holds a close relationship to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] as a link with A-Next, a future generation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

==In other media==
G.W. Bridge appears with War Machine in [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' Animated series]] in a cameo.  They're shown watching a conference dealing with a virus that mutants are supposedly responsible for, in the episode ''Time Fugitive Part 1''.
