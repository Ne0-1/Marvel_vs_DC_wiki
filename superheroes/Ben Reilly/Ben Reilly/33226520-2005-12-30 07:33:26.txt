'''Ben Reilly''', also known as the '''Scarlet Spider''' and the second '''Spider-Man''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics']] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. He was a [[Human cloning|clone]] of Peter Parker, the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], and was a prominent character in the [[Clone Saga]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #149 ([[October]] [[1975]]). 

==Biography==
[[image:webofspiderman118.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover to ''[[Web of Spider-Man #118]]''. Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider.]]
Ben Reilly was "born" in a tank of green goo, the [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]]'s second wholly successful clone, after the cloning of [[Gwen Stacy]]. Through a process of arcane science, he was then imbued with the memories of Peter Parker. After the latter was captured, the two found themselves, both in Spider-Man costume, in [[Shea Stadium]], and fought briefly before teaming-up in an attempt to save the Gwen clone. In the process, he appeared to be killed and the surviving Spider-Man, fearful of the questions the finding of a deceased Peter Parker might raise, dropped his body in a smokestack.

In actuality, he survived and crawled from the smokestack. Naming himself "Ben Reilly", after "his" aunt and uncle (and foster parents) [[May Reilly Parker|Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]], and taking some old clothes Parker had intended to donate to charity, he left New York, deeply depressed. Soon afterward, stricken with [[influenza]], he met Seward Trainer, a scientist secretly blackmailed by agents of the [[Green Goblin]] into keeping track of him. Trainer helped Reilly, first by giving the sick and depressed man help to get back on his feet, then, when Reilly returned to his life of wandering, by supplying references to allow him to get work, and becoming genuinely fatherly towards him. Following him was a failed earlier clone of Parker calling himself [[Kaine]] (after the biblical [[Cain]]), who believed Reilly to be the real Peter Parker and hated his "brother" for it (while admiring the "clone" Parker living Parker's life).

Three years after his "birth", he got a job in [[Salt Lake City]] as a research assistant on the back of Trainer's references. There, he became involved with a woman calling herself Janine Godbe, while Kaine became involved with a crooked detective called Louise Kennedy. "Janine" then began to push Ben away, but after he was bloodily beaten by Kaine and had nowhere else to go, he went to her apartment and she revealed that she was really a [[child abuse]] victim called Elizabeth Tyne, who had killed her abusive father and run away. Expecting him to push her away, she was shocked when he didn't and instead revealed his spider-powers and the fact that he was a clone to her.

After Kaine, who possessed the same fingerprints as Ben (and Peter) killed Kennedy, with the police believing Reilly was the culprit, they went on the run together for a year until Kaine forced her to leave Reilly, dropping a dead clone of her off a bridge to make Reilly think she'd died.

Five years after he left New York, he discovered that [[Aunt May|May Parker]] was dying from a stroke, he returned to New York, and encountered an embittered Spider-Man, shellshocked after several consecutive tragedies. Soon after, he donned a makeshift costume, and was dubbed the "Scarlet Spider" by the press - a moniker it took him some time to hear without wincing.

He later became the replacement Spider-Man for a time at the original's request, when Parker retired to raise his unborn child.  This was at a time when both men had been led to believe that Ben was the original and Peter was the clone.

Ultimately, he died saving the original Spider-Man from the [[Green Goblin]] in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #75 ([[December]] [[1996]]).  This sacrifice, coupled with the concurrent stillbirth of his child, led Parker to reclaim the Spider-Man identity.

For a brief time, Scarlet Spider was a member of the [[New Warriors]], though neither the members of the team nor the fans of either book really accepted this thoroughly.

==Alternate future==

In the alternate future known as [[MC2]], Reilly had a son by Elizabeth Tyne, named Reilly Tyne, who became the superhero known as [[Darkdevil]].  

Also in the [[MC2]] future, the identity of Scarlet Spider was briefly assumed by Felicity Hardy, the daughter of the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], in an attempt to become partners with [[Spider-Girl]] (who wears Ben's Spider-Man costume and refers to him as 'Uncle Ben').  Spider-Girl opposed this, and Spider-Man was angry at what he saw as an inappropriate use of the identity. Hardy attempted to join a couple of fights with Spider-Girl, but was unable to stay in the fight more than a few seconds in each case.  Hardy has since assisted Spider-Girl with behind-the-scenes work not requiring a costume, and has not resumed the identity since, though the solicitation for ''Spider-Girl'' #96 has said that she will return to help Spider-Girl in a fight against a [[Scrier]].

==Ultimate Ben Reilly==
In the [[Ultimate Universe]], Ben Reilly appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as an African-American lab assistant at Empire State University, working with [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Conners]]. He was involved in the creation of [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]]. 

Bendis has stated that "''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #101 is the beginning of the Clone Saga." [http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=40021]. What connection, if any, this has to the Ultimate Ben Reilly remains to be seen.
