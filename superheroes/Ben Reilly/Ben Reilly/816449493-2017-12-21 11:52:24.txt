'''Benjamin''' "'''Ben'''" '''Reilly''', also known as '''[[Scarlet Spider]]''', '''[[Spider-Man]]''', '''Spider-Carnage''', and '''[[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]''', is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[Human cloning|clone]] and ally of the original [[Spider-Man|Spider-Man (Peter Parker)]] and is prominent in the 1994 - 96 "[[Clone Saga]]" storyline, which led to his murder by the [[Green Goblin]] ([[Norman Osborn]]).

Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]], the character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #149 (October 1975). During the "Clone Saga" storyline, he came to wear a makeshift costume similar to Spider-Man's consisting of a blue sleeveless [[hoodie]] sweatshirt adorned with black motifs of a spider on its front and back, over a red spandex bodysuit and mask, with utility belts and wrist-worn sizable web-shooters that was designed by artist [[Tom Lyle]],<ref>Lewis, Devin (Editor). "Scarlet Letters", ''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'' #1 (2017). Marvel Comics. p. 22</ref> before donning a variation of Spider-Man's costume designed by artist [[Mark Bagley]] as his successor for some time before his death.

In 2017's "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" story arc, the character was resurrected. In the 2017 series ''Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider'', he reclaims his Scarlet Spider identity and reimagined by Marvel Comics' creative teams as an [[antihero]], starting a spiritual quest to redeem himself as a true hero once more.

==Publication history==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
Ben Reilly was first featured as Spider-Man in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149. The issue was later revisited in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #30. Asked why he created the character, writer [[Gerry Conway]] explained: {{quote|One of the things I was trying to do at that time was take ideas to their logical, yet absurd conclusion, ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. The idea was that if we have [[Gwen Stacy]] brought back as a clone, how can I up the stakes when I get rid of her? When I write her out of the book, what can I do to make that really effective and to punctuate it, to bring it to the next level? And I thought, if we can clone Gwen, we can certainly clone Peter. I was also at that time enamored with titles that played off of old, melodramatic [[Stan Lee]] titles of the past. ... I came up with the title, "If I Kill Me, Will I Die?"{{efn|The actual published title is "Even if I Live, I Die!". The source gives no indication whether the title was changed prior to publication or Conway simply misremembered it.}} It was basically a parody of an old overdramatic Stan Lee title, but I also thought it was a good title in general. So that's really what the impetus was - to raise the stakes, give us a good finish to the Gwen Stacy saga, and to allow me to have a little fun with the storytelling conventions of the time.<ref name="back44">{{cite journal|last=Veronese|first=Keith|date=October 2010|title=Spider-Man: The Beginnings of the Clone Saga|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=44| pages=69–77|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}}

Though Conway had no intention of using the character beyond this initial appearance, in which he dies,<ref name="back44"/> Reilly returned to the comics during the "Clone Saga", which ran from October 1994 to December 1996 through all five of the concurrent Spider-Man titles — ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. Editor [[Danny Fingeroth]] directed the Spider-Man artists to design a costume for the character which would stand out from conventional superhero costumes by emphasizing simple functionality rather than flash.<ref name="back44"/> The artists worked on costume ideas independently, and according to [[Mark Bagley]], [[Tom Lyle]]'s "[[hoodie]]" design won unanimous approval among them.<ref name="back44"/> The original costume was later replaced by an updated Spider-Man costume designed by Bagley with minor alterations by [[Bob Budiansky]].<ref name="back44"/>

Between November and December 1995, Scarlet Spider replaced Spider-Man in all five of the comics' titles, which became ''[[The Amazing Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Web of Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Scarlet Spider (comic book)|Scarlet Spider]]'', ''Scarlet-Spider Unlimited'', and ''[[The Spectacular Scarlet Spider]]''. Reilly was also featured prominently in the supplemental material provided for the storyline, including ''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' and ''Spider-Man: Clone Journals''. The storyline was later revisited in ''What If'' vol. 2 #86. Reilly was passed the mantle of Spider-Man and was featured throughout the Spider-Man titles ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man Unlimited'', and ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'', which replaced ''Web of Spider-Man'' as an ongoing monthly title. Reilly remained as the featured Spider-Man between January and December 1996. During this period, the character was also featured in two intercompany crossovers ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' with [[DC Comics]] and ''Backlash/Spider-Man'' with [[Image Comics]].

Though the character has not been used in mainstream continuity since his death in ''Spider-Man'' #75, the character is often alluded to and provided the foundation to the backstory in the [[Spider-Girl]] mythology. In January 2009, Reilly returned to comics as Spider-Man in the third part of Marvel's ''[[X-Men]]/[[Spider-Man]]'' miniseries. Written by [[Christos Gage]], the series explores episodes in the histories of both the X-Men and Spider-Man, sticking thoroughly to the source material of the timeframes the stories take place in. Issue #3 marked the first new adventure featuring Reilly in more than twelve years. Starting in [[2009 in comics|2009]], and continuing into [[2010 in comics|2010]], Marvel published a six-issue [[mini-series]] titled ''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'' that was a retelling of the story as it had originally been envisioned.<ref name="back44"/> In 2010 Marvel began collecting the story in trade paperback and hardcover forms ({{ISBN|978-0785148050}}). The epic spans five books and covers Reilly's time on the road, through his encounters with Peter and Mary Jane, up to his role as the Scarlet Spider, as the lone spider hero in New York.

===Mooted return===

On July 25, 2010, at the San Diego Comic-con, fans expressed their desire to see a return of Ben Reilly. To this, assistant editor Tom Brennan replied, "It's being worked on."<ref>{{Cite web|author=Wigler, Josh | url=http://www.cbr.com/cci-the-marvel-spider-man-panel/ | title=CCI: The Marvel: Spider-Man Panel | work=[[CBR.com]] | date=July 25, 2010}}</ref> During San Diego Comic Con 2011, a teaser image was posted on Marvel.com of Reilly's shirt in flames, entitled "The return of The Scarlet Spider?"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16304/sdcc_2011_the_scarlet_spider | title=SDCC 2011: The Scarlet Spider? | work=Marvel.com | date=July 22, 2011}}</ref> It is revealed in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #673 and the Marvel ''Point One'' [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] that Kaine will be the new Scarlet Spider in his own ongoing series, which was confirmed by editor Steve Wacker in the "Letters to the Editor" page of #673. Later, Ben Reilly in his Scarlet Spider uniform appears to be fighting Kaine on the cover of Scarlet Spider issue #21. At the climax of the issue it is revealed that this is Kraven the Hunter impersonating Reilly.

===Resurrection===
Ben Reilly is resurrected in the storyline "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]", where it was revealed that his remains had been retrieved by the Jackal after his death, the Jackal spending several months 'killing' Ben and bringing him back to life to try and perfect a new cloning process. Ben eventually managed to escape the Jackal's control, but was so broken by the experience of multiple deaths that he took control of the Jackal's scheme, even adopting the Jackal name for himself, and set out to bring several of Peter's deceased allies and enemies back to life, using a flawed cloning process that required the resurrected to ingest a pill on a daily basis to stay alive. After a final confrontation with Peter forced him to face how far he had fallen when he tried to 'kill' all of humanity and bring them back as 'immortal' clones, Ben fakes his death and relocates to Las Vegas to try and re-learn how to be a hero, returned to the Scarlet Spider identity.

==Fictional character biography==
===Creation===
Ben Reilly was created by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] (Professor Miles Warren), and was the first successful clone of [[Peter Parker]]; a [[Kaine Parker|previous clone]] suffered from clone degeneration and was considered unstable. Through arcane science, Reilly is imprinted with a copy of Parker's memories and in their first encounter believed himself to be Parker. After Parker was captured by Jackal, both Parker and Reilly found themselves in Spider-Man costumes at [[Shea Stadium]], and initially fought each other believing the other was the impostor. When realizing the stakes, they decided to team up in an attempt to save the [[Gwen Stacy]] clone and a captured [[Ned Leeds]]. In the process, Reilly appeared to be killed in an explosion,<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | penciller=[[Ross Andru|Andru, Ross]] | inker=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] | story=Even If I Live, I Die! | title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] | volume=1 | issue=149 | date=October 1975 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and Parker, fearful of the consequences of a corpse of a second Peter Parker being found, dropped Reilly's body into a smokestack. Reilly survived and escaped from the smokestack. When he witnessed Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]] in an embrace, Ben, despite acknowledging that he is a clone, also accepted Parker’s strong sense of morality as his own, refusing to succumb to the temptation of murdering his doppelgänger, and decided to embark on a nomadic life. He dubbed himself "Ben Reilly", using his uncle's first name and his aunt's maiden name ([[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] and [[Aunt May|May Reilly]] respectively).<ref name="back44"/> He took some old clothes Parker had intended to donate to charity, and he left New York deeply depressed but also inspired by his own advice to build a life of his own.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #223 (April 1995)</ref>

===Exile===
Stricken with [[influenza]], Ben Reilly meets Seward Trainer, a scientist who was secretly blackmailed by agents of [[Norman Osborn]] into keeping track of him. Trainer helps Reilly re-establish his life, and Reilly sees Trainer as a father figure. Reilly trusts Trainer completely because he helps Reilly survive his aimless wanderings, provides Reilly with forged credentials allowing him to find work for a few months at a time. Ben subsequently moves on just before people can examine the references closely enough to learn that they are faked, using the money earned to fund himself until he next needs work. During this time, Reilly is hunted by Kaine, a failed clone of Peter Parker. Kaine believed Reilly to be the original Peter Parker and hates him for being flawless, although initially Kaine is unsure why he is stalking Reilly other than wanting to see him suffer. Reilly finds love with college student/waitress Janine Godbe, but she later reveals that her true identity is Elizabeth Tyne, a fugitive who killed her father after enduring his repeating [[Child sexual abuse#Incest|incestuous abuse]]. Although he spends some time living with Janine, she apparently commits suicide out of guilt at her past crimes, leaving Reilly to be constantly followed by Kaine vowing to deny Reilly happiness for as long as he can.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' #1–3</ref>

Besides fighting Kaine, Reilly sporadically engages in heroics; although he dislikes playing the hero as it reminds him of life as Peter Parker, he finds himself unable to ignore his spider-sense when it goes off with sufficient intensity, also acting as a short-term vigilante to dismantle a major drugs cartel in [[Salt Lake City]] during his third year. During a particularly bleak period, Reilly works in dead-end jobs and allows himself to be regarded as mentally handicapped rather than interact with others. After his spider-sense prompts him to save a family from being killed during a robbery, he accepts that he cannot give in to despair and must try to make a difference when he can. Following this, he lives for a short time in Italy and works as an English teacher, but is forced to leave after a Mafia boss investigates Reilly's past when his daughter expresses an interest in Reilly. The Mafioso learns about the gaps in Reilly's work record and forced him to leave the city. While traveling, Reilly fights the mystical villain [[D'Spayre]] and a psychopathic showman named Wild-Whip.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Scarlet Spider===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Five years later, when working at a resort, Ben Reilly discovers that May Parker is dying from a stroke, so he returns to New York City. There, Reilly encounters Peter Parker, bitter and angry following several tragedies. While they initially come to blows, they begin working together. Reilly genuinely cares for the Parker family's well-being, but Parker is initially suspicious of his clone's motives. Eventually, however, Parker grows to trust Reilly. Soon after, despite doubting of himself as a hero, [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]'s ([[Eddie Brock]]) rampage, a recent encounter with Venom's offspring [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], and the past reports of Spider-Man repeatedly failed to stop him, spurs Reilly to don a makeshift costume, improved arsenal of Spider-Man's, and is dubbed the "[[Scarlet Spider]]" by the press.  Though Reilly initially intimidated by Venom's ferocity, he ultimately defeats him; he is even able to resist the bonding with the Venom symbiote with his strong will during the fight, a feat that even the original Spider-Man had failed to achieve. This victory over one of Spider-Man's major adversaries helps him gain the confidence he needs. However, Reilly and Venom also become enemies after their encounter; because he was cloned from Parker and left New York City prior to the ''[[Secret Wars]]'',  Reilly does not share Spider-Man's guilt over Venom's presence on Earth, and is determined to put an end to his threats. In addition, unlike Spider-Man, Reilly can detect the Venom symbiote and its offspring with his spider-sense. He would later encounter more enemies from Spider-Man's rogues gallery and as well as accumulating his own. The city welcomes the Scarlet Spider because of his tireless dedication to heroics, and [[J. Jonah Jameson]], despite his distrust, is unable to launch a smear campaign against him due to his popularity.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

For a brief time, Scarlet Spider joins the [[New Warriors]] after assisting them in dealing with the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] virus,<ref>''New Warriors'' #61</ref> though none of the team members fully accepts him because he refuses to reveal his identity out of his obligations to protect Spider-Man's secrets. When Peter is framed and arrested for Kaine's murders, Reilly switches places with him so Peter can remain free and uncover the truth, and allows Parker to use the Scarlet Spider costume for a brief time; Reilly gains Parker's respect and admiration in the process. He and Parker eventually discover that the Jackal is alive, and encounter more Spider-Man clones including the homicidal [[Spidercide]]. After defeating Jackal with Parker, Reilly seeks to continue on as Scarlet Spider, but is ultimately forced to drop the identity when, during gang warfare between the second [[Lady Octopus|Doctor Octopus]] and [[Alistair Smythe]], a holographic version of Scarlet Spider ruins Reilly's reputation in a vicious rampage. Reilly concludes that Doctor Octopus' deception has worked because he is still too new on the scene. He decides to take on the Spider-Man mantle and abandon his role in the New Warriors despite his attraction to [[Firestar]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Spider-Man===
[[File:Spider-Man (Ben Reilly).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ben Reilly as Spider-Man, wearing the costume designed by [[Mark Bagley]]. Art by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Klaus Janson]].]]
Ben Reilly later becomes the replacement version of Spider-Man for a time when Peter Parker retires to raise his unborn child. Reilly wears his own costume style rather than Parker's. Meanwhile, both men are misled by the Jackal and Seward Trainer, working under orders from Norman Osborn, into believing that Reilly is the original and Parker is the clone. Osborn hopes that the revelation that his life was a lie would make Parker give up; instead both Parker and Reilly see this as a chance to start again. Reilly starts working at a diner called the Daily Grind. He also dyes his hair blond to differentiate himself from Parker. Reilly works there for a year, battling villains. The change in costume initially prompts the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' to claim there is a new Spider-Man, but Reilly and Mary Jane Watson throw them off the scent and the story is dropped. Only the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], Venom, [[Silver Sable]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], the [[Human Torch]], and his former teammate [[Firestar]] ever learn that they are dealing with a different Spider-Man, although Reilly also tells [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] the truth, and [[Mysterio]] concludes that there had been a substitution when studying newspapers after being released from prison. The [[X-Men]] — specifically [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] — also know the truth because Reilly told them why he was unaware of an earlier team-up involving Peter helping the X-Men trace [[Mister Sinister]]'s activities.<ref>''Spider-Man/X-Men'' #3</ref>

Reilly later dates college students from Centennial University, Jessica Carradine and Desiree Winthrop. Still mourning Janine Godbe's apparent death, his relationship with Jessica ends because they discover each other's secrets; Jessica's late father was the burglar who killed Ben Parker, and Jessica witnesses that Ben and Spider-Man are the same man. Jessica realizes she would never have a proper relationship with Ben because of their pasts. Ben tutors Desiree before his break up with Jessica, and eventually dates her.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

====DC vs. Marvel====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
During the ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' intercompany crossover storyline, Ben Reilly inadvertently travels to a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel reality]] after being exposed to the dimensional rift. While stranded in this alternate reality, he encountered its heroes and villains while trying to find a way back. Temporarily using his 'original' name of Peter Parker, Reilly finds a job at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' as its staff photographer, working with the newspaper's top reporters [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]]. He saves Lane from being captured by a [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]]/[[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] team-up although he is subsequently embarrassed when he learns of her engagement to Kent after asking her out. Eventually, two cosmic entities force the heroes of both realities to fight a series of duels for the survival of their respective universes. Reilly is chosen to fight [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], the hybrid-clone of [[Superman]] and [[Lex Luthor]], and wins thanks to his spider-sense and use of impact webbing overwhelming Superboy's raw power. Reilly later teams up with Superboy to rescue the ''Daily Planet'''s staff from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], and Lane develops a slight attraction with Reilly's alter ego, before the realities are separated again.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

====Spider-Carnage====
[[File:Spider-Carnage.png|upright|thumb|Ben Reilly as Spider-Carnage, from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #410.<br>Cover art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
During the "Web of Carnage" arc, Ben Reilly is bonded with the Carnage symbiote when it escapes from Ravencroft Institute, where its psychopathic host Cletus Kasady is being held. Unlike his experience with the Venom symbiote, Reilly struggles for control of himself, and he attempts to trap it inside of him. He has [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] take him to a cell designed to hold Carnage and subjects himself to a potentially fatal dose of microwave radiation to try to kill the symbiote, which returns to Kasady via the pipes. Seward Trainer disappears while Ben fights with the Carnage symbiote. Reilly's bank account is frozen and his possessions stolen while the Grind is burned down and Reilly is framed for arson.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #3</ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #410</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #67</ref><ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233</ref>

====Blood Brothers====
The [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] is found to be perpetrating many of these events on the orders of [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]] and the company Multivex. Reilly's former lover Janine Godbe is taken to New York by Kaine informing the police about her crimes and whereabouts, and the two lovers go on the run. However, after a final confrontation between Reilly and Kaine in a diner, Kaine accepts that he should turn himself in to atone for his crimes. Reilly's words and Kaine's decision inspire Godbe to do the same.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

====Death====
Around the same time, Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson return to New York. He and Ben begin to contemplate the possibilities of Peter returning to the role full-time, providing the city with two Spider-Men to compensate for the recent loss of the [[Fantastic Four]] and crucial members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the war against Onslaught.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Parker helps Reilly fend off Gaunt's latest attack after his real identity was uncovered. Reilly is attacked by Norman Osborn while his spider-sense is disabled by a gas Gaunt used. Osborn reveals Reilly is the clone, beats him unconscious, and takes him and Parker to his base opposite the ''Daily Bugle'' offices. Osborn intends to blow up the building, with most of Parker and Reilly's friends inside it after they were sent false invitations. While Parker battles Osborn, Reilly attempts to evacuate the ''Daily Bugle'', but injures himself further while protecting [[Flash Thompson]] from a bomb. While helping Parker to remove the remaining bombs, Reilly intercepts a Goblin Glider before it can impale Parker. Reilly falls several stories and crashes onto a taxi underneath. As he lies dying, Reilly tells Parker that he will have to resume the role of Spider-Man. Reilly dies and his body decomposes rapidly, confirming that he was actually a clone. This sacrifice, and concurrent still-birth of his child, leads Parker to reclaim the Spider-Man identity.<ref>''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #75 (December 1996)</ref>

===Post-mortem===
During the 1998 "[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis]]" storyline, when Spider-Man adopts four new identities to continue to act as a hero after Norman Osborn put a bounty on him, his weapons as the [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]] include an adaptation of Ben's old sedative stingers,<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #27.

Ben Reilly appears as part of the 2015 [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, in the form of the mysterious man in a brilliant red suit with an [[Anubis]] mask, that everybody believes to be Miles Warren. After his death at the hands of the Green Goblin, Jackal collects Ben's dissolved remains and clones him. However, Jackal finds problems with the cellular degradation. He has Ben killed 26 more times, all of which have Ben's life (and most of Peter's) flash before his eyes. In the process, Ben's benevolent nature are repressed, becomes morally ambiguous, and mentally unbalanced resulted by his deathly ordeals. Ben eventually breaks free and knocks out Jackal. After he improves Warren's formula, he makes clones of Miles Warren and brainwashes Jackal that he is a clone, making it nearly impossible to tell who is the real one. Now free with a number of Miles Warren clones with the original as his servants, Ben becomes the new Jackal and is determined to repay the people who have influenced his and Peter's lives with Jackal's technology to make sure no one has to suffer again and those who have can become whole.<ref name="ASM4.22">''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #22.

Jackal has New U Technologies obtain the bodies of Doctor Octopus, Alistaire Smythe, and other villains for his "Reanimations." When the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot orchestrated the reanimation of Doctor Octopus' body, Doctor Octopus disposed of the Peter Parker conscious and took control of the body while emerging from the vat. Jackal gives Doctor Octopus his tentacle pack and some New U Pills that would help prevent any clone degeneration.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Spider-Man infiltrates New U Technologies and chases after Jackal. Following Jackal into a room, Spider-Man is caught by surprise by Gwen Stacy and then ensnared by Doctor Octopus.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #1</ref> After the Jackal breaks up the fight between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, he shows Spider-Man around the New U Technologies. After Spider-Man is rescued by Kaine and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman of Earth-65]], he is told that they visited unidentified alternate Earths where the collaboration of Parker Industries and New U Technologies resulted in humanity suffering a zombie apocalypse at the hands of the Carrion Virus.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2.

Ben starts driving Spider-Man to the New U Technologies facility with Uncle Ben's corpse and explains to Peter that he made his company and vision come to life through emotionally blackmailing the higher-ups of society. He shows Peter the "Haven," a section of the facility set up like a normal neighborhood where Peter sees all of his resurrected friends and enemies. He tells Ben that the reason he hasn't brought Uncle Ben back yet is because Uncle Ben would tell him that he's wrong and that he's using this power without responsibility. Jackal orders Spider-Man's enemies to kill him. Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and Jackal offers her the "Proto Clone" body in exchange for the formula. Doctor Octopus takes offense to Jackal's comments on Maria's dwarfism and attacks his boss. When Doctor Octopus activates the Carrion Virus, it starts spreading which causes Anna to also be affected. Jackal takes over J. Jonah's broadcast to tell the world that they will all die and be reborn.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the fight, Ben knocks Kaine out of the facility. Doctor Octopus fights Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency. When Spider-Man sends out a signal that prevents the clones from decaying, the clones of Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy are seemingly reduced to dust.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is revealed during the fight that Doctor Octopus implanted his mind into the Proto Clone and Ben Reilly saved himself using New U Pills and Webware Technology. He returns to his safehouse (designed after Peter's childhood home) only to find the true Miles Warren back as the Jackal. Jackal burns down Ben's safehouse before Ben defeats Jackal in a fight, leaving the mad scientist to supposedly die in the fire in the process. Ben swings off pondering what he's going to do with his life.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and equipment==
{{further|Spider-Man's powers and equipment}}
As Spider-Man's clone, Ben Reilly possesses spider-like powers identical to Peter Parker's, including superhuman strength, speed and agility, and the ability to cling to almost any surface. He also has a precognitive "spider-sense" that warns him of danger. Reilly's reflexes operate up to 40 times faster than those of a normal person, while his strength allows him to lift 150 times his own weight, although he has lifted much more. Because Reilly was not in the role of Spider-Man for five years while traveling, his fighting style is less polished than that of Parker's. However, Kaine noted that Reilly is a calculating and cunning combatant, able to strategically defeat powerful opponents such as Venom. He possesses Peter Parker's genius-level scientific intellect, and occasionally surpasses Parker in ingenuity of their shared expertise in the fields of [[applied science]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], and [[mechanics]]. Like Parker, Reilly is committed to better himself intellectually; he [[Autodidacticism|taught himself]] further in these disciplines and is a skilled scientist and inventor on par with Parker's scientific trainings despite do not receive a formal education as him and thus an autodidact. After enduring years of hardships, he develops a strong will powerful enough to overwhelmed both Venom and Carnage symbiotes' possession. However, this and lacking years of experience as a superhero than Parker also made Ben occasionally to act impulsively than Spider-Man.

Due to being stalked by Kaine during the five years of his worldwide travels, Ben Reilly makes his own improvements over Peter Parker's original web-shooters for defenses against Kaine's attacks. Reilly's web-shooters still have triggers on the inside palm to fire a web-line from a turbine-driven spinneret. Though Reilly's web-shooters can still fire them with a variety of options of web patterns, it was done by a piezoelectric valving instead of a nozzle adjustment ring as Parker's. Three new weapons are designed within the modified shooters. When twisting a shooter's wrist cuff, impact webbing is fired out as miniature web-pellets that explode on contact, encasing a target within a web cocoon and rendering him or her virtually immobile. Stingers are small, diamond-shaped darts coated with a paralyzing chemical agent to incapacitate opponents. Mini-dot tracers are miniaturized versions of Parker's spider-tracers (at 1/4" of their size), smaller and lighter and shaped like red diminutive Frisbees, which are even more difficult to detect and much faster when fired from Reilly's web-shooters. After Reilly assumes the role of Spider-Man, he then added legs to his tracers' casing to each shaped like a spider and thus resemble the standards’ in appearance along with for aerodynamic flight. Each of these projectiles are fired from a cassette-style launching pod built within the shooters. Because of Reilly's web-shooters are bulkier than Peter Parker's as the result of the modifications, he wears them on the outside of his costume. Like Parker, Reilly also wears a belt that contains spare web cartridges.{{issue|date=April 2017}}

While acting as the Jackal, Ben wears a scarlet business suit and an Egyptian-style [[Anubis]] mask.{{issue|date=April 2017}} Like Kaine, that being a clone of Spider-Man, Reilly is immune to the [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Psychic blindspot|worldwide mind purging]] of Spider-Man's identity and retains this knowledge.

After relocating to Las Vegas, Ben steals a Spider-Man-themed costume similar to another clone Spidercide's from a cosplayer, consisting of mostly red with a dark blue triangle on the chest and a red spider-emblem, along with a blue hood over a red mask. In his civilian identity, he initually wears a hoodie and large sunglasses to conceal the scarring caused by the flawed cloning process,<ref name="BRSS-1"/> before [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] restores his health and appearance. He would later forcefully take a replica of his Scarlet Spider costume from a would-be "[[real-life superhero]]" after getting criticized over the first costume he stole,<ref name="BRSS-3"/> and also recreated his web-shooters.

As a result of his resurrection by Death, Ben was cured of the scars left by the cloning process that brought him back to life, but has learned that these scars will return to varying degrees if he compromises his heroic status, such as an assault on a civilian who had committed robberies leaving Ben with new scarring around his right eye.

* ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #30, "What If Spider-Man's Clone Had Lived?", depicts a world where, after the Jackal's bomb explodes at Shea Stadium, both Spider-Men are knocked unconscious and the clone awakens before the original. The clone, believing that he is the original Peter Parker, puts Parker into stasis in one of the Jackal's clone-growing devices and attempts to continue with life as normal. However, the clone has no memories from the time before the cell samples he had been grown from were taken, and is confused and lost in the world of the real Peter Parker. This memory gap and the discovery of the Jackal's notes on his cloning process, leads the clone to realize what he truly is, and he frees the real Parker just in time for both of them to confront a threat from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Afterwards, the clone prepares to leave to seek his own fortune, but accepts an offer from Parker to co-operate in "shifts", switching between being Parker and Spider-Man. In this story, the clone never establishes a separate name for himself, and is referred to as "Spider-Clone", "brother", or "bro" by the original Parker.<ref>''What If?'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Mary Jane thanks Reilly and tells him to find his own identity.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #86. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga''===
In September 2009, a six issue miniseries based on the clone saga comics of the 1990s, titled ''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'', was issued. The purpose of the miniseries was to tell the story as it was initially conceived. It is a condensed version of the Clone Saga without the plot points involving Traveler, [[Cabal of Scrier|Scrier]], and covers several months of a fictional time period. The first issue introduces readers to the characters Ben Reilly and Kaine, and addresses Mary Jane's pregnancy and Aunt May's hospitalization. Reilly and Parker bond after Kaine attacks them, and Reilly decides to stay in New York, pretending to be Peter's blond haired cousin so he can build his own life. Reilly adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider and begins working at the Daily Grind.{{issue|date=April 2017}}

Reilly and Parker later work with Kaine to reach the lair of the shadowy figure responsible for infecting Mary Jane and Aunt May with a deadly genetic virus. The mysterious villain is revealed to be the Jackal, who captures all three and reveals his plans to make an army of Spider-Man clones to take over the world. Since Reilly is the only stable clone, Jackal takes a sample of his blood to perfect his cloning technique. When Jackal reveals another stage of his plan, to clone Gwen Stacy and another unknown figure, Kaine goes berserk, breaks himself, Parker and Reilly, free. During the subsequent fight, the clones dissolve and Jackal plants the first seed of doubt over who is the original Peter Parker. After Kaine kills Jackal, Reilly and Parker escape with the cure for Aunt May's and Mary Jane's virus. Parker retires and hands the Spider-Man identity to Reilly. Reilly spends several months in the role, while Parker gets ready to become a father. Reilly is shown as a less-polished Spider-Man and is somewhat insecure due to his relative inexperience because of his exile. Eventually, Mary Jane gives birth, Allison Mongrain kidnaps the baby, and later gives it to Kaine.{{issue|date=April 2017}}

When Reilly goes searching for the baby, he is attacked by the Green Goblin, who is revealed to be Harry Osborn and working with Kaine. Though Reilly appears to gain the upper hand in the ensuing fight, the Goblin impales him in the back with his glider. Miraculously, Reilly survives the attack. Osborn had been plotting his revenge against Parker since his apparent heart attack. Osborn creates a clone of his father, Norman, to help him defeat Parker and Reilly; however, Norman jumps in front of Harry's Goblin Glider as it is about to hit Parker and is impaled in the back. Afterwards, Kaine returns baby May to Parker and Mary Jane, Aunt May survives and wants to help raise the child, and Ben Reilly leaves once again to travel the world and find a life for himself.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'' #1–6.
