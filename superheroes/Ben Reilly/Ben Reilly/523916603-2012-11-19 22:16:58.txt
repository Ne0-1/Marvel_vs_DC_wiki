He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' issue 149 (October 1975).

==Powers and equipment==
{{unreferencedsection|date=July 2012}}
As Peter Parker's clone, Ben Reilly possesses powers identical to Parker's, including superhuman strength, speed and agility, and the ability to cling to almost any surface. At the time of his death, he also has a precognitive "spider-sense" that warns him of danger. Reilly's reflexes operate up to 40 times faster than those of a normal person, while his strength allows him to lift 150 times his own weight, although he has lifted much more. Because Reilly was not in the role of Spider-Man for five years while traveling, his fighting style is less polished than that of Parker's. However, as per the "Spider-Man Encyclopedia", Reilly seems to enjoy fighting more than Parker.

In the five years that Ben Reilly traveled the United States, he made improvements over Parker's original web-shooters. Reilly's web-shooters still had triggers on the inside palm to fire a web-line. However, three new weapons were designed. When using a twist of the wrist on the shooters, impact webbing is fired out as miniature web-pellets that explode on contact, encasing a target within a web cocoon and rendering him or her virtually immobile. Stingers are small, diamond-shaped darts coated with a paralyzing chemical agent to incapacitate opponents. Mini-dot tracers are smaller and lighter than Parker's spider-tracers, which are much faster when fired from his web-shooters.  Reilly wears his web-shooters on the outside of his costume. Like Parker, Reilly also wears a belt that contains spare web cartridges should he need replacements.

==Character biography==
===Creation===
{{unreferencedsection|date=July 2012}}
Ben Reilly was created by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], and was the first successful clone of Peter Parker; the first clone, [[Kaine]], suffered from clone degeneration which made him unstable. Through arcane science, Reilly is imprinted with Parker's memories and in their first encounter believed himself to be Parker. After Parker was captured by the Jackal, both Parker and Reilly found themselves in Spider-Man costumes at [[Shea Stadium]], and initially fought each other believing the other was the impostor. When realizing the stakes, they decided to team up in an attempt to save the Gwen Stacy clone and a captured [[Ned Leeds]]. In the process, Reilly appeared to be killed in an explosion,<ref name="asm148">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | penciller=[[Ross Andru|Andru, Ross]] | inker=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] | story=Even If I Live, I Die! | title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] | volume=1 | issue=149 | date=October 1975 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and Parker, fearful of the consequences of a corpse of a second Peter Parker being found, dropped Reilly's body into a smokestack.Reilly survived and escaped from the smokestack. When he witnessed Parker and Mary Jane Watson in an embrace, Ben decided to embark on a nomadic life. He dubbed himself "Ben Reilly", using his Uncle Ben's first name and his Aunt May's maiden name, [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] and [[Aunt May|May Reilly]] respectively. He took some old clothes Parker had intended to donate to charity, and he left New York deeply depressed.

===Exile===
Stricken with [[influenza]], Reilly meets Seward Trainer, a scientist who was secretly blackmailed by agents of the [[Green Goblin]] into keeping track of him.  Trainer helps Reilly re-establish his life, and Reilly sees Trainer as a father figure. Reilly trusts Trainer completely because he helps Reilly survive his aimless wanderings, provides Reilly with forged credentials allowing him to find work for a few months at a time. Ben subsequently moves on just before people can examine the references closely enough to learn that they are faked. During this time, Reilly is hunted by a failed clone of Peter Parker named Kaine, who believed Reilly to be the original Peter Parker and hates him for being flawless, although initially Kaine in unsure why he is stalking Reilly other than wanting to see him suffer. Reilly finds love with a college student named Janine Godbe, who later reveals that her true identity is Elizabeth Tyne, a fugitive who killed her father after enduring his sexual abuse since childhood. Although he spends some time living with Janine, she apparently commits suicide out of guilt at her past crimes, leaving Reilly to be constantly followed by Kaine, who vows to deny Reilly happiness for as long as he can.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' #1-3</ref>

Besides fighting Kaine, Reilly sporadically engages in heroics; although he dislikes playing the hero as it reminds him of life as Peter Parker, he finds himself unable to ignore his spider-sense. During a particularly bleak period, Reilly works in dead-end jobs and allows himself to be regarded as mentally handicapped rather than interact with others. After his spider-sense prompts him to save a family from being killed during a robbery, he accepts that he cannot give in to despair and must try to make a difference when he can. Following this, he lives for a short time in Italy and works as an English teacher, but is forced to leave after a Mafia boss investigates Reilly's past when his daughter expresses an interest in Reilly. The Mafioso learns about the gaps in Reilly's work record and forced him to leave the city. While traveling, Reilly fights the mystical villain [[D'Spayre]] and a psychopathic showman named Wild-Whip.

===Scarlet Spider===
{{unreferencedsection|date=July 2012}}
Five years later, Reilly discovers that [[Aunt May|May Parker]] is dying from a stroke, so he returns to New York. There, Reilly encounters Peter Parker, who has become bitter and angry following several tragedies. While they initially come to blows, they begin working together. Soon after, Reilly dons a makeshift costume, and is dubbed the 'Scarlet Spider' by the press after he defeats [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. This victory over one of Spider-Man's major adversaries helps Reilly gain the confidence he needs to believe that he can, perhaps, be a hero in his own right.

For a brief time, the Scarlet Spider joins the [[New Warriors]], though none of the team members fully accepts Reilly because he refuses to reveal his identity. When Peter Parker is framed and arrested for Kaine's murders, Reilly switches places with him so Peter can remain free and uncover the truth, and allows Parker to use the Scarlet Spider costume for a brief time. Reilly is finally forced to drop the Scarlet Spider identity when, after getting involved in gang warfare between [[Lady Octopus|the second Doctor Octopus]] and [[Alistair Smythe]], a holographic version of the Scarlet Spider is created, which ruins Reilly's reputation in a vicious rampage. Reilly concludes that the deception has worked because he is too new on the scene for people to trust him.

====Spider-Man====
[[File:Spider-Man (Ben Reilly).jpg|thumb|left|230px|Ben Reilly as Spider-Man. Art by [[Dan Jurgens]], and the costume designed by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
Reilly later becomes the replacement Spider-Man for a time at Parker's request, when Parker retires to raise his unborn child. Reilly wears his own costume style rather than using Parker's. Meanwhile, both men are misled by the Jackal and Seward Trainer, who are working under orders from Norman Osborn, the [[Green Goblin]], into believing that Reilly was the original and Parker was the clone. Osborn hopes that the revelation that his life was a lie would make Parker give up, instead both Parker and Reilly see this as a chance to start again. Reilly starts working at a diner called the Daily Grind; the owner offers him a job after he paid her back a quarter that she had loaned him, recognizing his honest nature. He also dyes his hair blond to differentiate himself from Parker. Reilly works there for a year, battling villains. The change in costume initially prompts the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' to claim there is a new Spider-Man, but Reilly and Mary Jane, throw them off the scent and the story is dropped. Only the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], Venom, [[Silver Sable]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], the [[Human Torch]], and his former teammate [[Firestar]] ever learn that they are dealing with a different Spider-Man, although Reilly also tells [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] the truth, and [[Mysterio]] concludes that there had been a substitution when studying newspapers after he is released from prison. This prompts the villain, who is dying, to target Daredevil as [[Guardian Devil|his last great scheme]]. A recently-published storyline revealed that the [[X-Men]] — specifically [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] — also know the truth because Reilly told them why he was unaware of an earlier team-up involving Parker, who helped the X-Men trace [[Mister Sinister]]'s activities.<ref>''Spider-Man/X-Men'' #3</ref>

Reilly later dates college students from Centennial University, Jessica Carradine and Desiree Winthrop.  Aside still mourning Janine Godbe's apparent death, his relationship with Jessica ends because they discover each other's secrets;  Jessica's late father was the burglar who killed Ben Parker, and Jessica witnesses that Ben and Spider-Man are apparently the same man.  Though Jessica saw Spider-Man as a hero after seeing him selflessly rescuing people from a burning skyscraper, she realizes she would never have a proper relationship with Ben because of their pasts. She decides not to reveal Ben’s secrets and leaves. Ben tutors Desiree before his break up with Jessica, and eventually dates her.

====DC vs. Marvel====
{{unreferencedsection|date=July 2012}}
During the ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' intercompany crossover storyline, Reilly inadvertently travels to a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel reality]] before the rest his native universe's inhabitants after passing by an alley during a patrol and being exposed to the dimensional rift within it. While stranded in this alternate reality, he encountered its heroes and villains, while trying to find a way back. Temporarily using his 'original' name of Peter Parker, Reilly finds a job at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' as its staff photographer, working with the newspaper's top reporters [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]]; he even saves Lane from being captured by a [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]]/[[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] team-up although he is subsequently embarrassed when he learns of her engagement to Kent after asking her out.  Eventually, two cosmic entities force the heroes of both realities to fight a series of duels for the survival of their respective universes.  Reilly is chosen to fight [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], the hybrid-clone of [[Superman]] and [[Lex Luthor]], and wins thank to his spider-sense and use of impact webbing overwhelming Superboy's raw power. Reilly later teams up with Superboy to rescue the ''Daily Planet'''s staff from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], and Lane develops a slight attraction with Reilly's alter ego, before the realities are separated again by the actions of [[Batman]], [[Captain America]], and [[Access (comics)|Access]].

====Spider-Carnage====
[[Image:Spider-carnage-1-.png|200px|right|thumb|Ben Reilly as Spider-Carnage, from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #410.<br>Cover art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
During the "Web of Carnage" arc,<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #3</ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #410</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #67</ref><ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233</ref> Ben Reilly is bonded with the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiote when it escapes from Ravencroft Institute, where its psychopathic host, Cletus Kasady, is being held, through the asylum's water pipes. Reilly struggles for control of himself, and tries to prevent the symbiote from taking over, the subsequent inner battle with the creature ends when he has John Jameson take him to a cell designed to hold Carnage, willingly subjects himself to a potentially fatal dose of microwave radiation to try to kill the symbiote, which returns to Kasady via the pipes. Seward Trainer disappears while Ben fights with the Carnage symbiote. Reilly's bank account is frozen and his possessions stolen while the Grind is burned down and Reilly is framed for arson.

====Blood Brothers====

It is revealed that the mastermind of these occurrences is the Green Goblin; Norman Osborn. Reilly's former lover Janine Godbe is taken to New York by Kaine, who informs the police about her crimes and whereabouts, and the two lovers to go on the run. However, after a final confrontation between Reilly and Kaine in a diner, Kaine accepts that he should turn himself in to atone for his crimes. Reilly's words and Kaine's decision inspire Godbe to do the same.

====Two Spider-Men====
Around the same time, Peter Parker and Mary Jane return to New York after a brief time in Portland. Parker's  powers had been lost during his time away, and had erratically returned after a near-death experience in which his body apparently reset itself. Although Parker's powers only partially returned at first- this weakness proving near-fatal when he briefly lost them while trying to escape a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] during the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught crisis]]-, as time went on, he and Ben began to contemplate the possibilities of Peter returning to the role full-time, providing the city with two Spider-Men to compensate for the recent loss of the Fantastic Four and crucial members of the Avengers during the war against Onslaught. Parker's powers return for good while he helps Reilly fend off the latest attack of Gaunt after his real identity was uncovered.

====Reilly's death====
Ultimately, the battle with Gaunt proves to be Reilly's undoing; Reilly is attacked by the original Green Goblin (Norman Osborn), who has survived his last fight with Spider-Man while his spider-sense was still disabled by a gas Gaunt had used. Osborn reveals Reilly's real identity as the clone, beats him unconscious then arranges for his minions to abduct Parker, dressed Parker in the original Spider-Man costume and takes him to Osborn's base opposite the ''Daily Bugle'' offices. Osborn intends to blow up the building, with most of Parker and Reilly's' friends inside it after they were sent false invitations. While Parker battles Osborn, Reilly attempts to evacuate the ''Daily Bugle'', but injures himself further after protecting [[Flash Thompson]] from a bomb. While helping Parker to remove the remaining bombs, Reilly intercepts a Goblin Glider before it can impale Parker, but the glider damages Reilly's spine. Reilly falls several stories and crashes onto a taxi underneath. As he lies dying, Reilly tells Parker that Parker is now Spider-Man and will have to resume the role for Reilly. Reilly dies and his body decomposed rapidly. Parker removes the body from public view and reveals Trainer's deceptions and proves that Reilly was actually a clone. This sacrifice, and concurrent still-birth of his child, leads Parker to reclaim the Spider-Man identity.<ref>''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #75 (December 1996)</ref>

As Ryder announces his plans to burn Parker's friends and family to death right in front of him after he admits his "true identity" as Ben Reilly, Kaine arrives and reveals that he has been working with Ryder. Kaine exposes both Parker's identity and Kaine's status as a "clone" of Reilly to Ryder, encouraging him to kill him, since if Reilly is a murderer, then Parker can be driven to kill as well. Refusing to accept this, Parker beats Ryder unconscious, affirms his and Reilly's innocence. Kaine and Ryder escape as police arrive.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #608-609</ref>

Reilly's last words before his death are about her: "Take care of my niece, Peter... tell her about... her Uncle Ben."<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #75</ref> May Parker keeps Reilly's in storage since his death, and uses them herself. When May asks her father about Reilly, however, Parker does not tell her that Reilly was a clone, but tells her that he was a cousin.

* Ben Reilly had a son by Janine Godbe (Elizabeth Tyne), named Reilly Tyne, who becomes a superhero called [[Darkdevil]].

===Ultimate Ben Reilly===
In the [[Ultimate Universe]], Ben Reilly appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as an African-American lab assistant at Empire State University, working with [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Connors]]. He is not a clone or connected to Peter Parker in this continuity. He is involved in the creation of [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]] by combining DNA from Curt Connors with that of Spider-Man, blended with ingredients from "The Suit" ([[Venom (comics)|Venom]]), making Ultimate Carnage a clone of Spider-Man.

===''What If?''===
{{unreferencedsection|date=July 2012}}

The clone, believing that he is the original Peter Parker, puts Parker into stasis in one of the Jackal's clone-growing devices and attempts to continue with life as normal. However, the clone has no memories from the time before the cell samples he had been grown from were taken, and is confused and lost in the world of the real Peter Parker. This memory gap. and the discovery of the Jackal's notes on his cloning process, leads the clone to realize what he truly is, and he frees the real Parker just in time for both of them to confront a threat from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Afterwards, the clone prepares to leave to seek his own fortune, but accepts an offer from Parker to co-operate in "shifts", switching between being Parker and Spider-Man. In this story, the clone never establishes a separate name for himself, and is referred to as "Spider-Clone", "brother", or "bro" by the original Parker.

''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' vol. 2, #86, "What If Scarlet Spider Killed Spider-Man?", gives an alternate ending of the "Clone Saga". During the time Spider-Man is under the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal's]] control, the Scarlet Spider and Spider-Man fight until there is an explosion.

The following year, Reilly and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] discover that their baby, May, is dying of blood poisoning. One night, Reilly wakes to find that May has been kidnapped. Ben searches for her and meets the Green Goblin, who reveals that he is behind the "Clone Saga" and needs May's blood for a serum. The two fight atop the [[George Washington Bridge]], where [[Gwen Stacy]] was killed. During the struggle, they both fall into the river below. Reilly resurfaces with the Goblin's mask and the serum and is met by Mary Jane. Reilly discovers that she knows that his true identity is Ben Reilly. Mary Jane thanks Reilly and tells him to find his own identity.

===''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga''===
{{unreferencedsection|date=July 2012}}
In September 2009, a six issue miniseries based on the clone saga comics of the 1990s, titled ''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'', was issued. The purpose of the miniseries was to tell the story as it was initially conceived. It is a condensed version of the Clone Saga without the plot points involving Traveler, [[Cabal of Scrier|Scrier]], and covers several months of a fictional time period.  The first issue introduces readers to the characters Ben Reilly and Kaine, and addresses Mary Jane's pregnancy and Aunt May's hospitalization. Reilly and Parker bond after Kaine attacks them, and Reilly decides to stay in New York, pretending to be Peter's blond haired cousin so he can build his own life. Reilly adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider and begins working at the Daily Grind.

Reilly and Parker later work with Kaine to reach the lair of the shadowy figure responsible for infecting Mary Jane and Aunt May with a deadly genetic virus. The mysterious villain is revealed to be the Jackal, who captures all three and reveals his plans to make an army of Spider-Man clones to take over the world. Since Reilly is the only stable clone, Jackal takes a sample of his blood to perfect his cloning technique. When Jackal reveals another stage of his plan, to clone Gwen Stacy and another unknown figure, Kaine goes berserk, breaks himself, Parker and Reilly, free. During the subsequent fight, the clones dissolve and Jackal plants the first seed of doubt over who is the original Peter Parker. After Kaine kills Jackal, Reilly and Parker escape with the cure for Aunt May's and Mary Jane's virus. Parker retires and hands the Spider-Man identity to Reilly. Reilly spends several months in the role, while Parker gets ready to become a father. Reilly is shown as a less-polished Spider-Man and is somewhat insecure due to his relative inexperience because of his exile. Eventually, Mary Jane gives birth, Allison Mongrain kidnaps the baby, and later gives it to Kaine. 

When Reilly goes searching for the baby, he is attacked by the Green Goblin, who is revealed to be Harry Osborn and working with Kaine. Though Reilly appears to gain the upper hand in the ensuing fight, the Goblin impales him in the back with his glider. Miraculously, Reilly survives the attack. Osborn had been plotting his revenge against Parker since his apparent heart attack. Osborn creates a clone of his father, Norman, to help him defeat Parker and Reilly; however, Norman jumps in front of Harry's Goblin Glider as it is about to hit Parker and is impaled in the back. Afterwards, Kaine returns baby May to Parker and Mary Jane, Aunt May survives and wants to help raise the child, and Ben Reilly leaves once again to travel the world and find a life for himself.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'' #1-6</ref>

==Publication history==
{{refimprovesection|date=July 2012}}
Ben Reilly was first featured as Spider-Man in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149. The issue was later revisited in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #30. The character returned to the comics during the "Clone Saga", which ran from October 1994 to December 1996 through all five of the concurrent Spider-Man titles — ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. Between November and December 1995, Scarlet Spider replaced Spider-Man in four of the comics' titles, which became ''[[The Amazing Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Web of Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Scarlet Spider (comics)|Scarlet Spider]]'', ''Scarlet-Spider Unlimited'', and ''[[The Spectacular Scarlet Spider]]''. Reilly was also featured prominently in the supplemental material provided for the storyline, including ''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' and ''Spider-Man: Clone Journals''. The storyline was later revisited in ''What If'' vol. 2, #86. Reilly was passed the mantle of Spider-Man and was featured throughout the Spider-Man titles ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man Unlimited'', and ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'', which replaced ''Web of Spider-Man'' as an ongoing monthly title. Reilly remained as the featured Spider-Man between January and December 1996. During this period, the character was also featured in two intercompany crossovers ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' with [[DC Comics]] and ''Backlash/Spider-Man'' with [[Image Comics]].

Though the character has not been used in mainstream continuity since Peter Parker  resumed the role of Spider-Man, the character is often alluded to and provided the foundation to the backstory in the [[Spider-Girl]] mythology. In January 2009, Reilly returned to comics as Spider-Man in the third part of Marvel's ''[[X-Men]]/[[Spider-Man]]'' miniseries. Written by [[Christos Gage]], the series explores episodes in the histories of both the X-Men and Spider-Man, sticking thoroughly to the source material of the timeframes the stories take place in. Issue #3 marked the first new adventure featuring Reilly in more than twelve years. After years of refusing to acknowledge the Clone Saga, in 2010 Marvel began collecting the story in trade paperback form. The epic spans five books and covers Reilly's time on the road, through his encounters with Peter and Mary Jane, up to his role as the Scarlet Spider, as the lone spider hero in New York.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Scarlet Spider made his first animated appearance on the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]''. In the episode "Nightmare In Green", where [[Doctor Doom]] fools [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into believing that the Fantastic Four are his enemies then Hulk's friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] is hanging out with [[Human Torch]], the shadowed figure of the Scarlet Spider can be seen hanging underneath a building ledge.

* Scarlet Spider appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series. In Season 4 episode "One Man's Worth (Part 1)", he is briefly featured in one of the scenes depicting a large battle.

* Ben Reilly's alternate universe counterpart, voiced by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]], appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. In the series finale "[[Spider Wars]]", numerous versions of Spider-Man from different realities team up, including Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider.
