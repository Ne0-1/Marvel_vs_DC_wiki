'''Ben Reilly''', also known as the '''Scarlet Spider''' and the second '''Spider-Man''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics']] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].  He is a [[Human cloning|clone]] of Peter Parker, the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], and is a prominent character in the [[Clone Saga]].  He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #149 (October [[1975]]). 

==Fictional character biography==
===Creation===
The being who would come to call himself Ben Reilly is the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]'s second wholly successful clone (the first successful clone is a clone of [[Gwen Stacy]], and the first clone of Spider-Man, [[Kaine]], is flawed).  Through a process of arcane science, the clone was imbued with Peter Parker's memories and actually believed himself to be the original.  After Parker was captured by the Jackal, the two found themselves, both in Spider-Man costume, in [[Shea Stadium]], and fought briefly before teaming up in an attempt to save the Gwen clone and [[Ned Leeds]].  In the process, the clone appeared to be killed and Spider-Man, fearful of the questions the finding of a deceased Peter Parker might raise, dropped the "body" into a smokestack.

===On the road===
However, the clone survived and escaped from the smokestack.  Naming himself "Ben Reilly" after "his" aunt and uncle (and foster parents) [[Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben]] (Reilly being May's [[maiden name]]), and taking some old clothes Parker had intended to donate to charity, he left New York, deeply depressed.  Soon afterward, stricken with [[influenza]], he met Seward Trainer, a scientist secretly blackmailed by agents of the [[Green Goblin]] into keeping track of him.  Trainer helped Reilly in two ways.  First, Trainer helped the sick and depressed clone to get back on his feet.  Second, when Reilly returned to his life of wandering, Trainer supplied references to allow Reilly to obtain jobs; the references were never effective enough for a long-term life, but they allowed Reilly to make some kind of life for himself during his travels.  Reilly came to see Trainer as a father figure, and he trusted Trainer completely.  During this time, Reilly was hunted by a failed clone of Peter Parker named Kaine (after the biblical [[Cain]]).  Kaine believed Reilly to be the real Peter Parker and hates his "brother" for it (while admiring the "clone" Parker living Parker's life).

Three years after his creation, Reilly got a job in [[Salt Lake City]] as a research and teaching assistant, thanks largely to Trainer's references.  There, he met a woman who called herself Janine Godbe.  "Janine" initially resisted involvement with Reilly, but she revealed that she was really a [[child abuse]] victim named Elizabeth Tyne, who had killed her abusive father, changed her name (she regarded 'Elizabeth' as being a victim, and wanted to escape that) and ran away to escape her crime.  Expecting to be rejected, Tyne was shocked when Reilly instead trusted her enough to reveal his spider-powers and the fact that he was a clone to her.  Expecting rejection, Reilly was relieved when she accepted him for who he was, even teasingly calling him 'Spider-Man'. 

While in Salt Lake City, Ben Reilly (and later Kaine) became involved in fighting against the Tannen criminal gang, wearing a makeshift costume out of green, mummy-like bandages, but when Janine's identity was revealed, the two were forced to flee.  After Kaine, who possessed the same fingerprints as Reilly and Parker, killed corrupt policewoman Louise Kennedy (a woman he had come to love before the truth about her was revealed to Kaine), the police believed Reilly was the culprit and Detective Raven pursued them both, despite Reilly having saved him and his son from mobsters.  Reilly and Tyne were on the run together for a year until Kaine forced her to leave Reilly, dropping a dead clone of her off a bridge to make Reilly think she'd died.  Meanwhile, Kaine killed more people, attempting to frame Reilly for the murders. 

===Return to New York===
[[image:webofspiderman118.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover to ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' vol. 2, #118.  Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider.]]Two years later, Reilly discovered that [[Aunt May|May Parker]] was dying from a stroke, so he returned to New York.  There, Reilly encountered Parker, who has become bitter and angry following several consecutive tragedies, and while they initially come to blows, they quickly begin working together.  Soon after, Reilly donned a makeshift costume, and was dubbed the "Scarlet Spider" by the press - a moniker it took him some time to hear without wincing.  As the Scarlet Spider, Reilly decided to take down [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].  Although a clone of Spider-Man, Ben was able to use his spider-sense to anticipate the attacks of Venom.  Venom did sense that Ben was not the Spider-Man responsible for their creation, but vowed to kill Reilly anyway.  Reilly defeated Venom by using his impact webbing to break the physical bond between the symbiote and Eddie Brock.

For a brief time, the Scarlet Spider was a member of the [[New Warriors]], though none of the members of the team really accepted this thoroughly.  When Peter Parker was arrested for Kaine's murders, Ben switched places with him so Peter can remain free and uncover the truth, allowing him to use the Scarlet Spider costume for a brief time.  Ben is finally forced to drop the Scarlet Spider identity when, after getting involved in a technological gang war between [[Lady Octopus|the second Doctor Octopus]] and [[Alistair Smythe]], a hologramatic evil version of the Scarlet Spider was created and ruined his reputation in a vicious rampage.

===Spider-Man===
[[Image:BenR_SpiderMan.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Cover to ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #0.  Ben Reilly as Spider-Man.]]
He later became the replacement Spider-Man for a time at the original's request, when Parker retired to raise his unborn child.  This is at a time when both men have been misled by Seward Trainer (who was still working under orders from Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin) into believing that Ben was the original and Peter was the clone, Osborn hoping that this will make his nemesis give up with the revelation that his life was a lie.  Reilly started working at a restaurant called the Daily Grind and spends a year in the role, battling villains new and old, and briefly being possessed by the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]].

During this time, Ben became involved with Jessica Carradine, the daughter of the [[Spider-Man villains|burglar]] who killed Peter's Uncle Ben.  She quickly discovered that he was Spider-Man, a significant problem, given that she believed that ''Uncle Ben'' had been the one with the gun in the robbery (the gun having accidentally shot Ben during the struggle when the burglar tried to disarm him) and Spider-Man had subsequently lied to the police and, later on, killed her father to prevent the 'truth' about the incident coming out.  Jessica nearly mailed a photo of Ben in his Spider-Man costume without the mask to the ''Daily Bugle'', but after seeing Ben save a number of people trapped in a burning building, she realizes that Spider-Man is a good man and gave him the photo before departing New York. 

It soon became clear a conspiracy was at work - the skeleton of a Spider-Man clone was found in the same smokestack he once occupied, Seward Trainer disappeared, and Ben has his bank account frozen and his apartment's possessions stolen before finally the Grind was burnt down and Ben was framed for arson.  In the six-part ''Blood Brothers'' storyline, it is revealed the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] was behind many of these events, on the orders of the mysterious Gaunt and the company Multiplex.  It will later be revealed the true mastermind behind all this was the original [[Green Goblin]].

Janine Godbe and Kaine return to Ben's life, but it was not destined to be a happy ending; Kaine has deliberately brought her back in order to traumatize Ben by taking her away, tipping off the police to her crimes and whereabouts and forcing the two lovers to go on the run (Ben appeared to be ready to abandon New York, saying that his life as Peter Parker was over and the people he loved back then are irrelevant).  Although Kaine was convinced by his 'brother' to give himself up to the police after saving Ben and Janine from a burning diner (despite the fact that Kaine caused the fire himself), Janine also decided to stop running.  Following Kaine's example, she was prepared to accept Ben's previous advice that she should entrust herself to the law and hope that the truth about her father's murder would be enough to keep her alive.

Ultimately, Reilly died saving the original Spider-Man from the Green Goblin in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #75 (December [[1996]]), intercepting the Goblin Glider as it flew towards Peter.  The glider struck his spine shortly before Ben fell to the ground, crashing into a taxi below him, leaving him in poor condition.  As he died, Ben tells Peter that, clone or not, Peter is now Spider-Man and would have to carry on for Ben, shortly before he passed away.  After dying, Reilly's body decomposes rapidly, revealing Trainer's deceptions and proving once and for all that Ben had actually been the clone.  This sacrifice, coupled with the concurrent stillbirth of his child, leads Parker to reclaim the Spider-Man identity, his last words to Ben's remains being "Rest easy... brother".

==Civil War==
In the 2006 ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' crossover, Peter Parker uses the psedonym Ben Reilly (as well as a holographic disguise device given to him by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]) in order to continue teaching at Midtown High School despite the trouble that arose following his public unmasking (''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #14).

==Alternate continuities==
[[Image:Spg46.jpg|130px|Cover to ''Spider-Girl'' #46, featuring Scarlet Spider II ([[Felicity Hardy]]).  Art by Pat Olliffe.|thumb|left]]
===MC2===
In the alternate future known as [[MC2]], Ben Reilly's 'niece', May Parker [[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|aka]] [[Spider-Girl]], wears Ben's version of the Spider-Man costume and webshooters, having been raised on tales of her heroic 'Uncle Ben'.

Ben Reilly had a son by Elizabeth Tyne, named Reilly Tyne, who became the superhero known as [[Darkdevil]] after Kaine tried to save his 'nephew' from cellular degeneration.  Hints about Darkdevil's true identity in early issues of ''Spider-Girl'' led many fans, as evidenced by the book's letter page, to theorize that Darkdevil was in fact Ben Reilly himself.  Later in the series, Kaine reformed.

[[Felicity Hardy]], the daughter of Felicia Hardy ([[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]), assumes the Scarlet Spider identity in an attempt to become partners with Spider-Girl.  May's father [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] is angry at what he sees as an inappropriate use of the identity.

===Ultimate Ben Reilly===
In the [[Ultimate Universe]], Ben Reilly appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as an African-American lab assistant at Empire State University, working with [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Conners]].  As such, he is not a clone or connected to Peter Parker in this continuity.  He was involved in the creation of [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]] by combining DNA from Curt Connors with that of [[Spider-Man]], blended with ingredients from "The Suit" (better known as [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]), making Ultimate Carnage something of a clone of Spider-Man.  Incidentally, he refers to Carnage (before its escape) as "Little Ben".  At the end of the arc, he stole a second Spider-Man blood sample from the lab.

In issue #102, it is revealed that after Ben took the blood sample, he managed to create the four Spider-Man clones while under the employ of the CIA.  However, Carnage attacked the lab and the four clones escaped, and nothing more was seen afterwards of Ben.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===

*Scarlet Spider made his first animated appearance on the [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)]] episode "Nightmare In Green," in which [[Dr. Doom]] fools [[Hulk]] into beleiving that the [[Fantastic Four]] are his enemies. While Hulk's friend [[Rick Jones]] is hanging out with [[Human Torch]], they run into the Scarlet Spider. Hulk becomes jealous of Human Torch, and Dr. Doom's influence only makes matters worse. Eventually Hulk and Thing have a showdown, and although Thing is defeated, Hulk decides to back down when Dr. Doom's true colors are revealed.

*Ben Reilly's alternate universe counterpart also appeared in the final season of [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]].  In the storyline "[[Spider Wars]]", numerous versions of Spider-Man from different realities teamed up, including Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider.  As he explains his origins, he and Spider-Carnage, the main villain of this series finale, have a relationship - Reilly is his clone or maybe Spider-Carnage is his clone.  None of them are sure because the Miles Warren in their reality had robbed them of their past.  Apparently, it hints that maybe Reilly is the real person and Spider-Carnage is the clone.
