'''Benjamin "Ben" Reilly''' (also known as the '''Scarlet Spider''', the second '''Spider-Man''' and '''Spider-Carnage''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. He is a [[Human cloning|clone]] of Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]), and is prominent in the [[Clone Saga]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #149 (October 1975).

==Publication history==
Reilly was first featured as Spider-Man in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #149. The issue was later revisited in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (vol. 1) #30.

The character returns to the comics during the [[Clone Saga]], which ran from October 1994 to December 1996 through all five of the then running Spider-Man titles, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', and ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]].''  Between November 1995 and December 1995, Scarlet Spider replaced Spider-Man in the four featured Spider-titles, becoming ''[[The Amazing Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Web of Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Scarlet Spider (comic book)|Scarlet Spider]]'', ''Scarlet-Spider Unlimited'', and ''[[The Spectacular Scarlet Spider]].'' Reilly was also featured prominently in the supplemental material provided for the storyline including: ''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' and ''Spider-Man: Clone Journals''.  The storyline would later be revisited in ''What If'' (vol. 2) #86.

Reilly was passed the mantle of Spider-Man and was featured through the Spider-Man titles ''Amazing Spider-Man'', ''Spectacular Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man Unlimited'', and ''[[Sensational Spider-Man]]'' which replaced ''Web of Spider-Man'' as an ongoing monthly title. Reilly remained as the featured Spider-Man between January 1996 until December 1996. During this period, the character also was featured in ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]''.

Though the character has not been utilized in mainstream continuity since Peter Parker has resumed as Spider-Man, the character is often alluded to and provided the foundation to the backstory in [[Spider-Girl]] mythology. In January 2009, Reilly returned to comics as Spider-Man in the third part of Marvel's ''[[X-Men]]/[[Spider-Man]]'' miniseries. Written by [[Christos Gage]], the series explores various times in the histories of both the [[X-Men]] and Spider-Man, sticking thoroughly to the source material of the timeframes the stories take place in. Issue #3 marked the first new starring adventure of Reilly in more than twelve years.

==Fictional character biography==
{{plot | date = June 2010}}
===Creation===
Ben Reilly is the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]'s second wholly successful cloneâ€”the first is the clone of [[Gwen Stacy]], and the first Spider-Man clone, [[Kaine]], is flawed. Through arcane science, the clone was imprinted with Peter Parker's memories and actually believed himself the original. After Parker was captured by the Jackal, both Parker and Reilly found themselves in Spider-Man costumes at [[Shea Stadium]], and fought briefly before teaming up in an attempt to save the Gwen clone and [[Ned Leeds]]. In the process, the clone appeared to be killed,<ref name="asm148">{{Comic book reference

 }}</ref> and Spider-Man, fearful of the consequences of "Peter Parker's" body turning up while he was still alive, dropped the "body" in a smokestack after confirming that he was the original (based on the fact that he instinctively thought of [[Mary Jane Watson]] when facing death while the clone should still have loved [[Gwen Stacy]]). The clone survived and escaped from the smokestack. Naming himself "Ben Reilly" after his uncle and aunt, [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] and [[Aunt May|May Reilly]] respectively, and taking some old clothes Parker had intended to donate to charity, he left New York deeply depressed.

===Five years on the road===
[[Image:Lostyears2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ben Reilly vs. [[Kaine]].<br>''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' #2.<br>Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]]

Stricken with [[influenza]], Ben met Seward Trainer, a scientist secretly blackmailed by agents of the [[Green Goblin]] into keeping track of him.  Trainer helped Reilly in two ways. First, Trainer helped the sick and depressed clone to get back on his feet. Second, when Reilly returned to his life of wandering, Trainer supplied references to allow Reilly to obtain jobs; the references were never effective enough for a long-term life, but they allowed Reilly to make some kind of life for himself during his travels. Reilly came to see Trainer as a father figure, and he trusted Trainer completely. During this time, Reilly was hunted by a failed clone of Peter Parker named [[Kaine]] (after the biblical [[Cain]]). Kaine believed Reilly to be the real Peter Parker and hated his "brother" for being real (while admiring the "clone" Parker living Parker's life).<ref>''Spider-Man: The Lost Years''</ref>

Three years after his creation, Reilly got a job in [[Salt Lake City]] as a research and teaching assistant, thanks largely to Trainer's references. There, he met a woman who called herself Janine Godbe, a waitress in a diner that Ben was eating in. Janine initially resisted involvement with Reilly, and then revealed she was really a [[child abuse]] victim named Elizabeth Tyne who had killed her abusive father, changed her name (she regarded 'Elizabeth' as being a victim, and wanted to escape that) and ran away to escape her crime. Expecting to be rejected, Tyne was shocked when Reilly instead trusted her enough to reveal his spider-powers and the fact that he was a clone to her. Equally prepared for rejection, Reilly was relieved when she accepted him for who he was, even teasingly calling him 'Spider-Man'.

While in Salt Lake City, Ben Reilly (and later Kaine) became involved in fighting against the Tannen criminal gang, wearing a makeshift costume of green, mummy-like bandages. When Janine's identity was revealed, the two were forced to flee. After Kaine, who possessed the same fingerprints as Reilly and Parker, killed corrupt policewoman Louise Kennedy (a woman he had come to love before the truth about her was revealed to Kaine), the police believed Reilly was the culprit and Detective Raven pursued them both, despite Reilly having saved him and his son from mobsters. Reilly and Tyne were on the run together for a year until Kaine forced her to leave Reilly, dropping a dead clone of her off a bridge to make Reilly think she had died. Meanwhile, Kaine continued killing, attempting to frame Reilly for the murders.

At some point, Reilly got a job as a lab assistant to a scientist named Damon Ryder.  The two became close friends during their work searching for proof of dinosaurs being human ancestors, with Ben meeting Ryder's wife and children. However, he soon discovered that Ryder had experimented on himself with velociraptor genes in an attempt to further their research. When he confronted him, Ryder grew angry and the two argued.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #608">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #608</ref> As Ryder began to mutate, Reilly met him at his home, not knowing that Kaine was tracking him and was waiting outside.  Kaine jumped in and attacked.  During the ensuing fight, Damon's house was set ablaze.  Having gone mad, Damon murdered his own family, though he did not realize it and blamed Ben.  Furious with what he has done, Reilly beat him unconscious, with Kaine commenting that the events that unfolded would no doubt cause problems in the future.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #609-610</ref>

As well as fighting Kaine, Reilly would sporadically and rarely engage in heroics; although he disliked playing the hero as it reminded him of the life he'd never lived as Peter Parker, he found himself unable to ignore his spider-sense when it went off with sufficient force. It would be revealed later that he had fought the mystical villain D'Spayre and a psychopathic showman named Wild-Whip during his time on the road.

===Return to New York===
Two years later, Reilly discovered that [[Aunt May|May Parker]] was dying from a stroke, so he returned to New York. There, Reilly encountered Peter Parker, who has become bitter and angry following several consecutive tragedies. While they initially came to blows, they quickly began working together. Soon after, Reilly donned a makeshift costume, and was dubbed the "Scarlet Spider" by the press - a name that took him some time to hear without wincing. As the Scarlet Spider, Reilly decided to take down [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. Although a clone of Spider-Man, Ben was able to use his spider-sense to anticipate the attacks of Venom, as Reilly was never bonded to the symbiote. Venom did sense that Ben was not the Spider-Man responsible for their creation, but vowed to kill Reilly anyway. Reilly ended up separating Eddie Brock and the symbiote, by physically tearing the symbiote away from its host.

For a brief time, the Scarlet Spider was a member of the [[New Warriors]], though none of the members of the team really fully accepted this.  When Peter Parker was arrested for Kaine's murders, Ben switched places with him so Peter could remain free and uncover the truth, allowing him to use the Scarlet Spider costume for a brief time. Ben was finally forced to drop the Scarlet Spider identity when, after getting involved in a technological gang war between [[Lady Octopus|the second Doctor Octopus]] and [[Alistair Smythe]], a holographic evil version of the Scarlet Spider was created and ruined his reputation in a vicious rampage.

====Spider-Man====
He later became the replacement Spider-Man for a time at the original's request, when Parker retired to raise his unborn child. This was at a time when both men had been misled by Seward Trainer (who was still working under orders from Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin) into believing that Ben was the original and Peter was the clone. Osborn hoped that this revelation that his life was a lie would make his nemesis give up.  Reilly started working at a restaurant called the Daily Grind and spent a year in the role, battling villains new and old. The change in costume initially prompted the [[Daily Bugle]] to claim there was a new Spider-Man, but Ben, with the help of Mary Jane, threw them off the scent and the story was dropped. Only [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and [[Silver Sable]]â€” and through Sable's deductions, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and the [[Human Torch]]â€” ever seemed to realize that they were dealing with a different Spider-Man to the one with which he was familiar, although Ben also told [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the Torch the truth. A recently-published storyline revealed that the [[X-Men]]- specifically [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]- were also aware of the 'substitution' when Ben proved ignorant of the X-Men's discovery that a past attack on the original X-Men by [[Kraven the Hunter]] and the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]]<ref>''Spider-Man/X-Men'' #1</ref> had been done at the bidding of [[Mister Sinister]]<ref>''Spider-Man/X-Men'' #2</ref> when he aided the X-Men in fighting Mister Sinister as he attempted to acquire a sample of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].<ref>''Spider-Man/X-Men'' #3</ref>

====Spider-Carnage====
[[Image:Spider-carnage-1-.png|200px|right|thumb|Ben Reilly as Spider-Carnage.<br>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #410.<br>Cover art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

During the '''Web of Carnage'''<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #3</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #410</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #67</ref><ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233</ref> arc, Ben Reilly was bonded with the symbiote [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. While incarcerated at [[Ravencroft]], the symbiote left Cletus Kassidy and bonded with [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]].  While trying to stop a rampaging Jameson, the symbiote changes host to bond with Reilly to form '''Spider-Carnage'''. Throughout this period, Ben struggled for control of himself, trying to prevent it from taking over.

Ben Reilly decides the only person able to help him rid himself of the Carnage symbiote is Peter Parker. After arriving at Ben Reilly's apartment, Peter, unaware that Ben is bonded with Carnage, turns the conversation toward resolving the mystery of the skeleton found in the smoke stack, which testing showed also was a clone of Peter Parker. Ben's internal thought struggle to kill Peter Parker then becomes more and more intense until Ben tells Peter to leave.

After Peter's departure, Ben continues to struggle with thoughts of killing Peter Parker. The symbiote convinces Ben that he has to protect Seward Trainer from Parker, who was on his way to visit Seward in the hospital to find out what he knew about the cloned skeleton. As Ben continues to struggle with thoughts of killing Peter Parker, he finds himself on the roof of the hospital fighting for control of himself. The symbiote nearly dominates Ben Reilly as hospital security guards attempt in vain to engage him. The rooftop fight causes Peter Parker to investigate and he is surprised to find a "Spider-Carnage". Spider-Carnage immediately attacks Parker and nearly knocks him off the roof of the hospital. Peter reaches out to Ben Reilly and pleads with him to fight the symbiote that is nearly in complete control of him. Ben barely regains control of himself and warns Peter to stay away from Seward or he would not be responsible for his actions against Peter.

Reilly was eventually able to free himself of the symbiote, after a long inner battle with the creature, overcoming it with the strength of his character. Shortly after separating from Ben, the symbiote rejoined with Kassidy. Seward Trainer disappeared while Ben fought his battle with the Carnage symbiote. Ben had his bank account frozen and his possessions stolen before, finally, the [[Grind]] was burned down and Ben was framed for [[arson]].

====Blood Brothers====
It is revealed that the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] was behind many of these events, on the orders of the mysterious [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]] and the company Multivex.  It was later revealed that the true mastermind behind all this was the original [[Green Goblin]]: Norman Osborn.

Janine Godbe and Kaine returned to Ben's life but it was not destined to be a happy reunion; Kaine had deliberately brought her back in order to traumatize Ben by taking her away again, tipping off the police to her crimes and whereabouts and forcing the two lovers to go on the run (Ben appeared to be ready to abandon New York, saying that his life as Peter Parker was over and the people he loved back then were irrelevant). Although Kaine was convinced by his 'brother' to give himself up to the police after saving Ben and Janine from a burning diner (despite the fact that Kaine caused the fire himself), Janine also decided to stop running. Following Kaine's example, she was prepared to accept Ben's previous advice that she should entrust herself to the law and hope that the truth about her father's murder would be enough to keep her alive.

===Revelations and death===
Ultimately, Reilly died saving the original Spider-Man from the original Green Goblin, revealed to have survived his last fight with Spider-Man,<ref>''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #75 (December 1996)</ref> intercepting the Goblin Glider as it flew towards Peter.  The glider struck his spine and sent Ben falling to the ground, crashing into a taxi below him, leaving him in poor condition. As he lay dying, Ben told Peter that, clone or not, Peter was now Spider-Man and would have to carry on for Ben, and for Peter to tell his unborn child of her "Uncle Ben". After dying, Reilly's body decomposed rapidly, Spider-Man barely managing to get Ben's body out of public sight before it collapsed, revealing Trainer's deceptions and proving once and for all that Ben had actually been the clone. This sacrifice, coupled with the concurrent "stillbirth" of his child, led Parker to reclaim the Spider-Man identity, his last words to Ben's remains being "Rest easy... brother".

===Post-Mortem===
====Marvel Knights Spider-Man====
During the "Venomous" arc, Peter thinks of those close to him that he's lost, including "poor old Ben Reilly".

====Civil War====
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], '''[[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]''' used the pseudonym Ben Reilly as well as a holographic disguise device given to him by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].<ref>''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #14</ref>

====The Initiative====
While on a mission to depower Spider-Man, the Initiative employed three "[[Michael Van Patrick|Spider-Men]]" in the [[Iron Spider#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|Iron Spider]] costume to aid in the capture of the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. They were called Scarlet Spiders by [[War Machine]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #3</ref> Two are killed, with the final continuing to use the identity in current Avengers Initiative comics.

One of the people [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] gave Spider-Man's powers to appears in a costume that Ben wore as the Scarlet Spider in a jail cell, where the real Spider-Man had put him.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2</ref>

===="Who Was Ben Reilly?"====
Years after Reilly's death, a super-powered Damon Ryder (going by the name "Raptor") appears during Aunt May's engagement party in Boston. Having stalked the Reillys for some time to find Ben, he instead sees Peter and attacks him.  Peter is able to sneak off and change into his costume.  The two battle and Raptor claims to be after Ben Reilly, who murdered his family.  The news shocks Peter and Raptor escapes. Later investigating by Peter reveals that Ryder's entire family was killed in a fire started by an arsonist, and that he gave a police sketch of the arsonist that looks exactly like Peter and Ben.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual #36''</ref>

Ryder then appears in New York City and confronts Peter, still believing him to be Ben Reilly and repeatedly calling him "Ben".  The two fight in the middle of the office of Frontline after Raptor threatens to target Peter's family. Ryder gains the upper hand before Peter's coworkers get in the way, then leaves after handing over the article on the arsonist, with [[Ben Urich]] noting that it appears to be Peter in the sketch. Ryder ditches his jacket not knowing a spider-tracer was on it, and heads to Peter's apartment to seemingly attack his roommate.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #608"/> After a scuffle with Kaine, Peter returns to his apartment and finds his roommate unharmed, though she gave him the address of Aunt May's home. Peter heads there, only to find Raptor holding [[Harry Osborn]] and his cousins hostage at gunpoint. As Raptor announces his plans to burn his friends and family to death right in front of him after he admits his "true identity" as Ben Reilly, Kaine arrives, revealing that he has been working with Raptor.  Kaine exposes both Peter's identity and his status as a "clone" of Reilly to Raptor, encouraging him to kill him, since if Reilly is a murderer, then Peter could be driven to kill as well.  Refusing to accept this, Peter beats Raptor unconscious, while affirming his and Reilly's innocence and the fact that they would never murder anyone. He is forced to flee when the police arrive, so Kaine and Raptor escape.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #608-609</ref>
====Web of Spider-Man====
Ben Reilly has appeared three times since the relaunch of the [[Web of Spider-Man]] title in 2009. In issue # 1 he appears in a cameo as a figment of fellow Peter Parker clone, Kaine's dying delusion, before seemingly being slayed by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]].

February 2010 saw the release of issue # 5, in which Reilly stars in the story Ben Reilly in "Nobody." Set in his years in exile, Reilly assumes the name Henry Jones, taking a job as a [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] high school's janitor and rescuing a woman from a group of home invaders.

In Issue #8, Reilly is seen teaching students in Italy where he becomes romantically involved with the daughter of a Mafia don. He then defends himself from the threats of the family and leaves the country.

==Powers and equipment==
As Peter Parker's clone, Ben Reilly possesses powers identical to that of Spider-Man. His powers include superhuman strength, speed and agility, a precognitive "spider-sense" warning him of danger, and the spider-like ability to cling to almost any surface, referred to as "wallcrawling" or "stick'um powers". Reilly's reflexes operate up to 40 times faster than those of a normal person, while his strength allows him to lift 150 times his own weight, although he has been proven to lift much more. Because Reilly was out of commission as Spider-Man while on the road for five years, his fighting style is "less polished" than that of Parker's. However, as per the "Spider-Man Encyclopedia", Reilly actually seems to enjoy fighting more than Parker.

In the five years that Ben Reilly wandered [[United States|America]] he had time to improve over Peter Parker's original web-shooters. Worn on the outside of his costume, Reilly's web-shooters have no trigger on the inside palm, instead utilizing a twist of the wrist to fire webbing. In addition, two new weapons were designed to aid crime fighting. Impact webbing was fired out as miniature web-pellets that exploded on contact, encasing a target within a web cocoon and rendering them virtually immobile. Stingers were small diamond-shaped darts coated with a paralytic chemical agent for incapacitating opponents. Like Spider-Man, Ben also wore a belt that contained spare web cartridges should he need replacements.  Ben Reilly's spider-powers vary depending on the writer and artist.  For instance, in Marvel Comics vs DC Comics, he is capable of defeating Superboy, despite the latter's normally far greater power.

==Other versions==
===MC-2===
*In the alternate future known as [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Ben Reilly's 'niece', May Parker [[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|aka]] [[Spider-Girl]], wears Ben's version of the Spider-Man costume and webshooters, having been raised on tales of her heroic 'Uncle Ben'. Like her father, May has an [[Uncle Ben]]. However, unlike her dad, May never knew her uncle: Ben Reilly, Spider-Man's clone. His last words before his death are about her: "Take care of my 'niece,' Peter... tell her about... her Uncle Ben" (''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' vol. 1 #75). Her first costume and web-shooters are in fact his, kept in storage since his death. When May asks her father about him, however, Peter leaves out the fact that Ben was really a clone, instead referring to him as a [[cousin]]. If May has any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben - May's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]]. As Peter and MJ named May after Peter's [[Aunt May]], May asks which Uncle Ben the newborn is named after: her Uncle Ben, or Peter's Uncle Ben. Peter asks if it really matters, and May simply responds, "I guess not".

*Ben Reilly had a son by Janine Godbe (Elizabeth Tyne), named Reilly Tyne, who became the superhero known as [[Darkdevil]] after Kaine tried to save his 'nephew' from cellular degeneration. Later in the series, Kaine reformed.

*[[Felicity Hardy]], the daughter of Felicia Hardy ([[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]), assumes the Scarlet Spider identity in an attempt to become partners with Spider-Girl. May's father [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] is angry at what he sees as an inappropriate use of the identity.

===Ultimate Ben Reilly===
In the [[Ultimate Universe]], Ben Reilly appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as an African-American lab assistant at Empire State University, working with [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Connors]]. As such, he is not a clone or connected to Peter Parker in this continuity. He was involved in the creation of [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]] by combining DNA from Curt Connors with that of [[Spider-Man]], blended with ingredients from "The Suit" (better known as [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]), making Ultimate Carnage something of a clone of Spider-Man. Incidentally, he refers to Carnage (before its escape) as "Little Ben". At the end of the arc, he stole a second Spider-Man blood sample from the lab.

It was revealed that after Ben took the blood sample, he managed to create the five Spider-Man clones while under the employ of the [[CIA]]. However, Carnage attacked the lab and the four clones escaped. One of the clones is an amalgam of Ben Reilly and Kaine of the 616 Universe. He has Kaine's insane personality and facial scars, and wears a tattered makeshift version of Ben Reilly's costume. The character of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)#Ultimate Spider-Woman|Ultimate Spider-Woman]] more or less plays the same role that Scarlet Spider from the original Clone Saga did.

===What If?===
====Volume 1====
''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' v.1 #30 "What If Spider-Man's Clone Had Lived", depicts a world where, after the Jackal's bomb explodes at Shea Stadium, both Spider-Men are knocked unconscious and the clone awakens before the original.

The clone, believing that he is the genuine Peter Parker, puts his counterpart in stasis in one of the Jackal's clone-growing devices and attempts to continue with life as normal. However, as the clone's memories only extend to the point, several months prior, where the cell samples he had been grown from were taken, he is confused and lost in the world of the real Peter Parker. This memory gap, combined with the discovery of the Jackal's notes on his cloning process, leads the clone to realize what he truly is, and he frees the real Parker just in time for the two of them to confront a threat from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] (with the original acting as Spider-Man and the clone as Peter Parker).

Afterwards, the clone prepares to leave to seek his own fortune, but ultimately accepts an offer from the original to cooperate in "shifts", switching off between being Parker and Spider-Man. In this story, the clone never establishes a separate name for himself, and is referred to as "Spider-Clone", "brother", or "bro" by the original Parker.

====Volume 2====
''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' v. 2 #86 ("What If Scarlet Spider Killed Spider-Man") gives an alternate ending of the [[Clone Saga]]. During the time Spider-Man is under the [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal's]] control, the Scarlet Spider and [[Spider-Man]] fight until there is an explosion. Ben's body is later found washed ashore and Peter is believed to be dead. Ben awakes in the hospital to find Peter's friends and family around his bed believing him to be Peter.

A little more than a year later Ben and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] discover that their baby, May, is dying of blood poisoning. One night Ben wakes up to find that May has been kidnapped. Ben goes searching for her and runs into the [[Green Goblin]]. The Goblin reveals that he is behind the "clone saga" and needs May's blood for a serum.

The two battle atop the [[George Washington Bridge|same bridge]] where [[Gwen Stacy]] was killed. During the struggle, they both fall into the river below. Ben resurfaces with possession of the Goblin's mask and the serum. He is met by Mary Jane and discovers that she knows that he is really Ben Reilly. Mary Jane thanks him for all that he has done for them and tells Ben to go find his own identity, something he's never had the chance to do before.

There is a possibility, that the Spider-Girl that appeared in [[Paradise X]], as a member of Heralds, was in fact the adult May from this world.

===Marvel Zombies===
Someone in the Scarlet Spider uniform is in a large group shot in the one-shot: ''"[[Marvel Zombies]]: Dead Days"''.
===Spider-Man: Clone Saga===
September 2009 saw the launch of a six issue miniseries based on the original clone saga of the 1990s, titled Spider-Man: The Clone Saga. The writers explain in the first issue that the purpose of the miniseries was to tell the story as it was initially conceived.  As such, it is a condensed version of the Clone Saga with the excess plot points involving Traveler, [[Cabal of Scrier|Scrier]], and others cut out, while still being set over a several month period.     

The first issue introduced readers to both Ben Reilly and [[Kaine]],  as well as addressing Mary Jane's pregnancy and Aunt May's hospitalization.  Ben and Peter bond after Kaine attacks them, and Ben decides to stay in New York pretending to be Peter's blond haired cousin so he can build a life of his own.  He also adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider and begins working at the Daily Grind.  
 
He and Peter later work with Kaine to reach the lair of the shadowy figure responsible for infecting Mary Jane and Aunt May with a deadly genetic virus.  The mysterious villain is revealed to be a still-living Jackal, who captures all three and reveals that he plans to make an army of Spider-Clones to take over the world.  Since Ben was the only clone to ever turn out stable, Jackal takes a sample of his blood to perfect his cloning technique of Peter, while noting mixing the two would be catastrophic.  When Jackal reveals yet another stage of his plan - to clone Gwen Stacy and another unknown figure - Kaine goes berserk and breaks all three free.  During the subsequent fight, the clones dissolve and Jackal plants the first seed of doubt over who is the original Peter Parker.  After Kaine kills Jackal, Ben and Peter escape with the cure, saving Aunt May and Mary Jane.  At this point, Peter decides to retire and hands the Spider-Man identity over to Ben, who shortly thereafter begins wearing his new Spider-Man costume.

Reilly spends several months in the role while Peter gets ready to become a father.  He is shown to be a less-polished Spider-Man and is somewhat insecure, however, compared to Peter due to his relative inexperience while he was in exile.  Eventually, Mary Jane gives birth.  As in the original saga, Allison Mongrain kidnaps the baby, though she later turns it over to Kaine.  When Ben goes searching for her, he is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] (whom Kaine is working with).  Though Ben appears to gain the upper hand in the ensuing fight, the Goblin manages to impale him in the back with his glider. 

Miraculously, Ben survives the attack by the Green Goblin, who is revealed to be Harry Osborn, alive and well. He had been plotting his revenge against Peter since his apparent heart attack in Spectacular Spider-Man #200. Harry created a clone of his father, Norman, to help him defeat Peter and Ben; however, Norman jumps in front of Harry's Goblin Glider just as it was about to hit Peter and is impaled in the back, mirroring the events that happened to Ben in Spider-Man #75. Afterwards, Kaine returned baby May to Peter and Mary Jane, Aunt May survives and wants to help in raising little May, and Ben Reilly leaves once again to travel the world and find a life for himself.<ref>''Spider-Man: Clone Saga'' #1-6</ref>

===Possible return===

After the release of "Spider-Man: the Clone Saga" miniseries, various blogs reviewed the series. Reportedly, Howard Mackie and Tom DeFalco, creators of the miniseries had this to say to a manager of one blog: "Thanks, Brad. I truly appreciate all the kind words, and that Tom gets all the blame for the minor negatives! Tom and I would LOVE to continue with Benâ€“ and have pitched a seriesâ€“ but that is Marvelâ€™s call. Maybe a grassroots movement would help? Thanks again".<ref>http://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/wordpress/2010/02/25/ben-reilly-solo-series-pitched-to-marvel/</ref> The blog is "Spider-Man Crawl Space" and news of this quote was posted February 25, 2010.

On July 25, at the 2010 San Diego Comic-con many fans expressed their desire to see a return of Ben Reilly. To this, assistant editor Tom Brennan replied "It's being worked on"<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27464/</ref>.

The recent mini series "Spider-Man: The Clone Saga" has been collected in both paperback and hardcover forms and is being sold and marketed under the name "Spider-Man: The REAL Clone Saga". Whether this references the plot as it "should" have played out, or if it indicates a future retcon of the original clone saga remains to be seen.

==In other media==
===Television===
*Scarlet Spider made his first animated appearance on the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' TV episode "Nightmare In Green," in which [[Dr. Doom]] fools [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into believing that the [[Fantastic Four]] are his enemies. While Hulk's friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] is hanging out with [[Human Torch]], the shadowed figure of the Scarlet Spider can be seen hanging underneath a building ledge.

*Scarlet Spider's second TV appearance was made in the ''X-Men'' animated series. In episode 46 "One Man's Worth, Part 1", aired in the 95-96 season, he's briefly featured in one of the scenes depicting a large battle. (This happens around 7m:10s)

*Ben Reilly's alternate universe counterpart also appeared in the final season of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. In the storyline "[[Spider Wars]]", numerous versions of Spider-Man from different realities teamed up, including Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider. As he explains his origins, he and Spider-Carnage, the main villain of this series finale, realize they are related - Reilly is his clone or maybe Spider-Carnage is his clone. None of them are sure because the Miles Warren in their reality had robbed them of their past.  Apparently, it hints that maybe Reilly is the real Spider-Man and Spider-Carnage is the clone, due to the difference in their genetic structures. In the scene where Ben explains his story involving multiple spider-clones, Spider-Man remarks "This is starting to sound like a bad comic book plot!", an in-joke nod to the [[Clone Saga]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/episode/hateclones/ |title=Spider Wars Part One - I Really, Really Hate Clones revies |accessdate=2008-02-21  |publisher=marvel.toonzone.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/episode/farewell/ |title=Spider Wars Part Two - Farewell Spider-Man review |accessdate=2008-02-21 |publisher=marvel.toonzone.net}}</ref>
