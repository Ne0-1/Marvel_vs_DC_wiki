'''Ben Reilly''', also known as the '''Scarlet Spider''', is [[fictional character]], a [[clone]] of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics']] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was created by the villainous [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]] in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #149 ([[October]] [[1975]]).  Although he was believed to have died in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #150, it was later revealed that he had survived and wandered the [[United States of America|USA]] for five years.  When he discovered that [[Aunt May|May Parker]] was dying from a stroke, he returned to New York, and encountered an embittered Spider-Man, shellshocked after several consecutive tragedies. Soon after, he donned a makeshift costume, and was dubbed the "Scarlet Spider" by the press - a moniker it took him some time to hear without wincing.

He later became the replacement Spider-Man for a time at Parker's request, when he retired to raise his unborn child. Ultimately, he died saving [[Peter Parker]], the original Spider-Man, from the [[Green Goblin]] in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #75 ([[December]] [[1996]]).  Coupled with the concurrent stillbirth of his child, this sacrifice led Parker to reclaim the Spider-Man identity.
