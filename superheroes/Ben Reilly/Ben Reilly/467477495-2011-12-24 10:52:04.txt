'''Benjamin "Ben" Reilly''' (also known as the '''Scarlet Spider''', the second '''Spider-Man''', and '''Spider-Carnage''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. He is a [[Human cloning|clone]] of Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]), and is prominent in the "[[Clone Saga]]" story arc. He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #149 (October 1975).

==Publication history==
Ben Reilly was first featured as Spider-Man in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149. The issue was later revisited in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #30.

The character returns to the comics during the "[[Clone Saga]]", which ran from October 1994 to December 1996 through all five of the then running Spider-Man titles — ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. Between November and December 1995, [[Scarlet Spider]] replaced Spider-Man in the four featured Spider-titles, becoming ''[[The Amazing Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Web of Scarlet Spider]]'', ''[[Scarlet Spider (comic book)|Scarlet Spider]]'', ''Scarlet-Spider Unlimited'', and ''[[The Spectacular Scarlet Spider]]''. Reilly was also featured prominently in the supplemental material provided for the storyline, including ''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' and ''Spider-Man: Clone Journals''. The storyline would later be revisited in ''What If'' vol. 2, #86.

Reilly was passed the mantle of Spider-Man and was featured through the Spider-Man titles ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man'', ''Spider-Man Unlimited'', and ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man]]'', which replaced ''Web of Spider-Man'' as an ongoing monthly title. Reilly remained as the featured Spider-Man between January and December 1996. During this period, the character was also featured in ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]''.

Though the character has not been utilized in mainstream continuity since Peter Parker has resumed as Spider-Man, the character is often alluded to and provided the foundation to the backstory in the [[Spider-Girl]] mythology. In January 2009, Reilly returned to comics as Spider-Man in the third part of Marvel's ''[[X-Men]]/[[Spider-Man]]'' miniseries. Written by [[Christos Gage]], the series explores various times in the histories of both the X-Men and Spider-Man, sticking thoroughly to the source material of the timeframes the stories take place in. Issue #3 marked the first new adventure starring of Reilly in more than twelve years.

After years of refusing to acknowledge the Clone Saga, Marvel decided in 2010 to begin collecting the story in trade paperback form. The epic spans five books and covers Ben's time on the road, through his encounters with Peter and Mary Jane, up to his role (as the Scarlet Spider) as the lone spider hero in New York.

The rest of Reilly's fictional life will be collected in 2011 and will presumably cover his time as the Scarlet Spider, his role as the new Spider-Man, and his death in "Revelations".

==Fictional character biography==
===Creation===
Ben Reilly was the first successful clone of Peter Parker created by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], as the first clone, [[Kaine]], had suffered from clone degeneration which made him become unstable. Through arcane science, Ben is imprinted with Peter's memories and in their first encounter believed himself to be the original. After Peter Parker was captured by the Jackal, both Parker and Reilly found themselves in Spider-Man costumes at [[Shea Stadium]], and initially fought each other believing the other was the imposter. When realizing the stakes, they decided to team up in an attempt to save the Gwen Stacy clone and a captured [[Ned Leeds]]. In the process, the clone appeared to be killed in the explosion,<ref name="asm148">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | penciller=[[Ross Andru|Andru, Ross]] | inker=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Esposito, Mike]] | story=Even If I Live, I Die! | title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] | volume=1 | issue=149 | date=October 1975 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and Parker, fearful of the consequences of a second body of "Peter Parker" turning up while he was still alive, dropped Reilly's body in a smokestack. Ben apparently survived and escaped from the smokestack. When he witnessed Parker and Mary Jane Watson in an embrace, Ben decided to embark on a nomadic life as if no one knew his existence. He dubbed himself the alias "Ben Reilly", using his Uncle Ben's first name and his Aunt May's maiden name, [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] and [[Aunt May|May Reilly]] respectively. He unnoticeably took some old clothes Parker had intended to donate to charity, and he left New York deeply depressed.

===Five years on the road===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lostyears2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ben Reilly vs. [[Kaine]], from ''Spider-Man: The Lost Years'' #2.<br>Cover art by [[John Romita, Jr.]]]] -->
Stricken with [[influenza]], Ben meets Seward Trainer, a scientist secretly blackmailed by agents of the [[Green Goblin]] into keeping track of him.  Trainer helps Reilly get back on his feet. Reilly comes to see Trainer as a father figure, and he trusts him completely, having helped Reilly survive his aimless wanderings around by providing Ben with forged credentials allowing him to find work for a few months at a time, Ben subsequently moving on just before people can examine the references closely enough to learn that they are faked. During this time, Reilly is hunted by a failed clone of Peter Parker named [[Kaine]], who believed Reilly to be the real Peter Parker and hated him for being flawless, although initially even he wasn't sure why he was stalking Reilly other than possibly out of a desire to see him suffer.  He also finds love with a college student named Janine Godbe, who later reveals that her true identity is Elizabeth Tyne, a fugitive who killed her father after enduring sexual abuses from him since childhood.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Lost Years''{{Issue|date=June 2011}}</ref> Although he spent some time living with Janine, she eventually apparently committed suicide out of guilt at her past crimes, leaving Reilly to be constantly followed by Kaine, who had now vowed to deny Reilly happiness for as long as he could.

Besides fighting Kaine, Reilly would sporadically engage in heroics; although he dislikes playing the hero as it reminds him of the life as Peter Parker, he finds himself unable to ignore his spider-sense when it went off with sufficient force; although he attempted to ignore it during a bitter period of his life, spending time working meaningless jobs and allowing himself to be regarded as mentally handicapped rather than interact with others, after his spider-sense prompted him to save a family from being killed during a robbery, he accepted that he couldn't give in to despair and had to at least try to make a difference when he could. Following this, he briefly lived in Italy and worked as an English teacher, but was forced to leave after a Mafia boss investigated Reilly's past after his daughter expressed an interest in him, learning about the gaps in his records and forcing him to leave the city due to the potential danger of the unanswered questions he posed. It would be revealed later that he had fought the mystical villain [[D'Spayre]] and a psychopathic showman named Wild-Whip during his time on the road.

===Return to New York, Birth of the Scarlet Spider===
Five years later, Reilly discovers that [[Aunt May|May Parker]] is dying from a stroke, so he returns to New York. There, Reilly encounters Peter Parker, who has become bitter and angry following several tragedies. While they initially come to blows, they quickly begin working together. Soon after, Reilly dons a makeshift costume, and is dubbed the "Scarlet Spider" by the press after he defeated [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].

For a brief time, the Scarlet Spider joins the [[New Warriors]], though none of the members of the team fully accepts this, because he refuses to reveal his identity.  When Peter Parker is framed and arrested for Kaine's murders, Ben switched places with him so Peter could remain free and uncover the truth, allowing him to use the Scarlet Spider costume for a brief time. Ben was finally forced to drop the Scarlet Spider identity when, after getting involved in a technological gang war between [[Lady Octopus|the second Doctor Octopus]] and [[Alistair Smythe]], a holographic version of the Scarlet Spider was created and ruined his reputation in a vicious rampage, Ben concluding that the deception had mainly worked because he was too new on the scene for people to trust him.

====Spider-Man====
Ben later becomes the replacement Spider-Man for a time at the original's request, when Peter Parker retires to raise his unborn child, although he adopts his own costume style rather than just using Peter's traditional costume. This was at a time when both men had been misled by Seward Trainer (who was working under orders from Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin) into believing that Ben was the original and Peter was the clone. Osborn hoped that this revelation that his life was a lie would make his nemesis give up, instead both Parker and Ben ultimately see this as a chance to start over. Reilly started working at a restaurant called the Daily Grind- the owner offering him a job after he paid her back a quarter that she had loaned him on a hunch, recognising his essentially honest nature- and spent a year in the role, battling villains new and old. The change in costume initially prompted the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' to claim there was a new Spider-Man, but Ben, with the help of Mary Jane, threw them off the scent and the story was dropped. Only the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], [[Silver Sable]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and the [[Human Torch]] never learned or realized that they were dealing with a different Spider-Man, although Ben also told [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the Torch the truth. A recently-published storyline revealed that the [[X-Men]] — specifically [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] — also knew the truth because Ben had to tell them why he was unaware of an earlier team-up involving Peter helping the X-Men track down clues to [[Mister Sinister]]'s activities based on files he discovered after the [[Kraven's Last Hunt|death of]] [[Kraven the Hunter]], although Wolverine informed Ben that his willingness to fight alongside the X-Men during the subsequent confrontation with Mister Sinister and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] proved that he was the real Spider-Man in every way that mattered despite Sinister implying that Ben was the clone.<ref>''Spider-Man/X-Men'' #3</ref>

====Spider-Carnage====
[[Image:Spider-carnage-1-.png|200px|right|thumb|Ben Reilly as Spider-Carnage, from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #410.<br>Cover art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
During the "Web of Carnage" arc,<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #3</ref><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #410</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #67</ref><ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233</ref> Ben Reilly was bonded with the symbiote [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. Ben struggled for control of himself, trying to prevent the symbiote from taking over. Reilly is eventually able to free himself of the symbiote, after a long inner battle with the creature. Seward Trainer disappeared while Ben fought his battle with the Carnage symbiote. Ben had his bank account frozen and his possessions stolen, while the Grind was burned down and Ben was framed for [[arson]].

====Blood Brothers====
It is revealed that the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] was behind many of these events, on the orders of the mysterious [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]] and the company Multivex. It was later revealed that the true mastermind behind all this was the original [[Green Goblin]]: Norman Osborn.

Ben's former lover Janine Godbe is brought to New York by Kaine, but at the same time Kaine tips off the police to her crimes and whereabouts and forcing the two lovers to go on the run. However, after a final confrontation between Ben and Kaine in a diner, Kaine accepted that he had to turn himself in to atone for his crimes, Ben's words and Kaine's decision inspiring Janine to do the same, recognising that they cannot allow themselves to be defined by their pasts any more than Ben allows himself to be defined by his 'past' as Peter Parker.

===Death in 'Revelations'===
Ultimately, Reilly dies saving the original Spider-Man from the original Green Goblin, revealed to have survived his last fight with Spider-Man. After being severely beaten, Ben intercepts a Goblin Glider before it can impale Peter. As he lays dying, Ben told Peter that Peter was now Spider-Man and would have to carry on for Ben, and for Peter to tell his unborn child of her "Uncle Ben". After dying, Reilly's body decomposed rapidly, revealing Trainer's deceptions and proving that Ben had actually been the clone. This sacrifice, coupled with the concurrent "stillbirth" of his child, led Parker to reclaim the Spider-Man identity, his last words to Ben's remains being "Rest easy... brother."<ref>''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' #75 (December 1996)</ref>

===Post-mortem===
====Civil War====
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] uses the pseudonym Ben Reilly as well as a holographic disguise device given to him by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].<ref>''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #14</ref>

====The Initiative====
While on a mission to depower Spider-Man, the Initiative employs three "[[Michael Van Patrick|Spider-Men]]" in the [[Iron Spider#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|Iron Spider]] costume to aid in the capture of the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. They were called Scarlet Spiders by [[War Machine]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #3</ref> Two are killed, with the final continuing to use the identity.

One of the people [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] gave Spider-Man's powers to appears in a costume that Ben wore as the Scarlet Spider in a jail cell, where the real Spider-Man had put him.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2{{Issue|date=June 2011}}</ref>

====Who Was Ben Reilly?====
Years after Reilly's death, a man named Damon Ryder (going by the alias "Raptor") appears during Aunt May's engagement party. Having stalked the Reillys for some time to find Ben, he mistakes Peter for him and attacks.  Peter is able to sneak off and change into his costume. The two battle and Raptor claims to be after Ben Reilly, who murdered his family. Later investigating by Peter reveals that Ryder's entire family was killed in a fire started by an arsonist, and that he gave a police sketch of the arsonist that looks exactly like Peter and Ben.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #36</ref>

Ryder then appears in New York City and confronts Peter, still believing him to be Ben Reilly. The two fight after Raptor threatens to target Peter's family. Ryder gains the upper hand before Peter's coworkers get in the way, then leaves after handing over the article on the arsonist, with [[Ben Urich]] noting that it appears to be Peter in the sketch.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #608">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #608</ref> After a scuffle with Kaine, Peter finds Raptor holding [[Harry Osborn]] and his cousins hostage at gunpoint. As Raptor announces his plans to burn his friends and family to death right in front of him after he admits his "true identity" as Ben Reilly, Kaine arrives, revealing that he has been working with Raptor. Kaine exposes both Peter's identity and his status as a "clone" of Reilly to Raptor, encouraging him to kill him, since if Reilly is a murderer, then Peter could be driven to kill as well. Refusing to accept this, Peter beats Raptor unconscious, while affirming his and Reilly's innocence and the fact that they would never murder anyone. He is forced to flee when the police arrive, so Kaine and Raptor escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #608-609</ref>

===Teased return===
After the release of ''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'' miniseries, various blogs reviewed the series. Reportedly, Howard Mackie and Tom DeFalco, creators of the miniseries had this to say to Brad Douglas, manager of the Spider-Man Crawl Space website: "Thanks, Brad. I truly appreciate all the kind words, and that Tom gets all the blame for the minor negatives! Tom and I would LOVE to continue with Ben — and have pitched a series — but that is Marvel's call. Maybe a grassroots movement would help? Thanks again."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/wordpress/2010/02/25/ben-reilly-solo-series-pitched-to-marvel/ | title=Ben Reilly Solo Series Pitched to Marvel | work=SpidermanCrawlspace.com | date=February 25, 2010}}</ref>

On July 25, 2010, at the San Diego Comic-con, fans expressed their desire to see a return of Ben Reilly. To this, assistant editor Tom Brennan replied, "It's being worked on."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27464/ | title=CCI: The Marvel: Spider-Man Panel | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=July 25, 2010}}</ref>

The mini series ''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'' (in which Ben survives the "Revelations" battle) has been collected in both paperback and hardcover forms and is being sold and marketed under the name ''Spider-Man: The REAL Clone Saga'' (ISBN 978-0785148050).

During San Diego Comic Con 2011, a teaser image was posted on Marvel.com of Ben's shirt flaming, entitled "The return of The Scarlet Spider?".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16304/sdcc_2011_the_scarlet_spider | title=SDCC 2011: The Scarlet Spider? | work=Marvel.com | date=July 22, 2011}}</ref> It was revealed in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #673 as well as the Marvel ''Point One'' [[one-shot]] that Ben's clone brother Kaine will be the new Scarlet Spider in his own ongoing series instead of Ben returning. This was confirmed by editor Steve Wacker in the "Letters to the Editor" page of #673.

==Powers and equipment==
As Peter Parker's clone, Ben Reilly possesses [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|powers identical to that of Spider-Man]]. His powers include superhuman strength, speed and agility, and the spider-like ability to cling to almost any surface, referred to as "wallcrawling" or "stick'em powers". At the time of his death, he also had a precognitive "spider-sense" warning him of danger. Reilly's reflexes operate up to 40 times faster than those of a normal person, while his strength allows him to lift 150 times his own weight, although he has been proven to lift much more. Because Reilly was out of commission as Spider-Man while on the road for five years, his fighting style is "less polished" than that of Parker's. However, as per the "Spider-Man Encyclopedia", Reilly actually seems to enjoy fighting more than Parker.

In the five years that Ben Reilly wandered [[United States|America]] he had time to improve over Peter Parker's original web-shooters. Worn on the outside of his costume, Reilly's web-shooters have no trigger on the inside palm, instead utilizing a twist of the wrist to fire webbing. In addition, two new weapons were designed to aid crime fighting. Impact webbing was fired out as miniature web-pellets that exploded on contact, encasing a target within a web cocoon and rendering them virtually immobile. Stingers were small diamond-shaped darts coated with a paralytic chemical agent for incapacitating opponents. Like Spider-Man, Ben also wore a belt that contained spare web cartridges should he need replacements.

==Other versions==
===MC-2===
* In the alternate future known as [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], Ben Reilly's "niece", May Parker ([[Spider-Girl]]), wears Ben's version of the Spider-Man costume and webshooters, having been raised on tales of her heroic "Uncle Ben". Like her father, May has an [[Uncle Ben]]. However, unlike her dad, May never knew her uncle: Ben Reilly, Spider-Man's clone. His last words before his death are about her: "Take care of my niece, Peter... tell her about... her Uncle Ben."<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #75</ref> Her first costume and web-shooters are in fact his, kept in storage since his death. When May asks her father about him, however, Peter leaves out the fact that Ben was really a clone, instead referring to him as a [[cousin]]. If May has any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben — May's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]]. As Peter and MJ named May after Peter's [[Aunt May]], May asks which Uncle Ben the newborn is named after: her Uncle Ben, or Peter's Uncle Ben. Peter asks if it really matters, and May simply responds, "I guess not."

* Ben Reilly had a son by Janine Godbe (Elizabeth Tyne), named Reilly Tyne, who became the superhero known as [[Darkdevil]] after Kaine's efforts to save his "nephew" from cellular degeneration resulted in him being partly possessed by the demon [[Zarathos]] and the spirit of the deceased [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]]. Later in the series, Kaine reformed.

* [[Felicity Hardy]], the daughter of Felicia Hardy ([[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]), assumes the Scarlet Spider identity in an attempt to become partners with Spider-Girl. May's father [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] is angry at what he sees as an inappropriate use of the identity.

===Ultimate Ben Reilly===
In the [[Ultimate Universe]], Ben Reilly appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as an African-American lab assistant at Empire State University, working with [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Connors]]. As such, he is not a clone or connected to Peter Parker in this continuity. He was involved in the creation of [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]] by combining DNA from Curt Connors with that of [[Spider-Man]], blended with ingredients from "The Suit" (better known as [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]), making Ultimate Carnage something of a clone of Spider-Man. Incidentally, he refers to Carnage (before its escape) as "Little Ben". At the end of the arc, he stole a second Spider-Man blood sample from the lab.

It was revealed that after Ben took the blood sample, he managed to create the five Spider-Man clones while under the employ of the [[CIA]]. However, Carnage attacked the lab and the four clones escaped. One of the clones is an amalgam of Ben Reilly and Kaine of the 616 Universe. He has Kaine's insane personality and facial scars, and wears a tattered makeshift version of Ben Reilly's costume. The character of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)#Ultimate Spider-Woman|Ultimate Spider-Woman]] more or less plays the same role that Scarlet Spider from the original "Clone Saga" did.

===''What If?''===
====Volume 1====
''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #30, "What If Spider-Man's Clone Had Lived?", depicts a world where, after the Jackal's bomb explodes at Shea Stadium, both Spider-Men are knocked unconscious and the clone awakens before the original.

The clone, believing that he is the genuine Peter Parker, puts his counterpart in stasis in one of the Jackal's clone-growing devices and attempts to continue with life as normal. However, as the clone's memories only extend to the point, several months prior, where the cell samples he had been grown from were taken, he is confused and lost in the world of the real Peter Parker. This memory gap, combined with the discovery of the Jackal's notes on his cloning process, leads the clone to realize what he truly is, and he frees the real Parker just in time for the two of them to confront a threat from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] (with the original acting as Spider-Man and the clone as Peter Parker).

Afterwards, the clone prepares to leave to seek his own fortune, but ultimately accepts an offer from the original to cooperate in "shifts", switching off between being Parker and Spider-Man. In this story, the clone never establishes a separate name for himself, and is referred to as "Spider-Clone", "brother", or "bro" by the original Parker.

====Volume 2====
''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' vol. 2, #86, "What If Scarlet Spider Killed Spider-Man?", gives an alternate ending of the "Clone Saga". During the time Spider-Man is under the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal's]] control, the Scarlet Spider and [[Spider-Man]] fight until there is an explosion. Ben's body is later found washed ashore and Peter is believed to be dead. Ben awakes in the hospital to find Peter's friends and family around his bed believing him to be Peter.

A little more than a year later Ben and [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] discover that their baby, May, is dying of blood poisoning. One night Ben wakes up to find that May has been kidnapped. Ben goes searching for her and runs into the [[Green Goblin]]. The Goblin reveals that he is behind the "Clone Saga" and needs May's blood for a serum.

The two battle atop the [[George Washington Bridge|same bridge]] where [[Gwen Stacy]] was killed. During the struggle, they both fall into the river below. Ben resurfaces with possession of the Goblin's mask and the serum. He is met by Mary Jane and discovers that she knows that he is really Ben Reilly. Mary Jane thanks him for all that he has done for them and tells Ben to go find his own identity, something he's never had the chance to do before.

There is a possibility, that the Spider-Girl that appeared in [[Paradise X]], as a member of Heralds, was in fact the adult May from this world.

===Marvel Zombies===
Someone in the Scarlet Spider uniform is in a large group shot in the one-shot ''[[Marvel Zombies]]: Dead Days''.

===''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga''===
September 2009 saw the launch of a six issue miniseries based on the original clone saga of the 1990s, titled ''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga''. The writers explained in the first issue that the purpose of the miniseries was to tell the story as it was initially conceived. As such, it is a condensed version of the Clone Saga with the excess plot points involving Traveler, [[Cabal of Scrier|Scrier]], and others cut out, while still being set over a several month period.     

The first issue introduced readers to both Ben Reilly and [[Kaine]], as well as addressing Mary Jane's pregnancy and Aunt May's hospitalization. Ben and Peter bond after Kaine attacks them, and Ben decides to stay in New York pretending to be Peter's blond haired cousin so he can build a life of his own. He also adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider and begins working at the Daily Grind.

He and Peter later work with Kaine to reach the lair of the shadowy figure responsible for infecting Mary Jane and Aunt May with a deadly genetic virus. The mysterious villain is revealed to be a still-living Jackal, who captures all three and reveals that he plans to make an army of Spider-Clones to take over the world. Since Ben was the only clone to ever turn out stable, Jackal takes a sample of his blood to perfect his cloning technique of Peter, while noting mixing the two would be catastrophic. When Jackal reveals yet another stage of his plan — to clone Gwen Stacy and another unknown figure — Kaine goes berserk and breaks all three free. During the subsequent fight, the clones dissolve and Jackal plants the first seed of doubt over who is the original Peter Parker. After Kaine kills Jackal, Ben and Peter escape with the cure, saving Aunt May and Mary Jane. At this point, Peter decides to retire and hands the Spider-Man identity over to Ben, who shortly thereafter begins wearing his new Spider-Man costume.

Reilly spends several months in the role while Peter gets ready to become a father. He is shown to be a less-polished Spider-Man and is somewhat insecure, however, compared to Peter due to his relative inexperience while he was in exile. Eventually, Mary Jane gives birth. As in the original saga, Allison Mongrain kidnaps the baby, though she later turns it over to Kaine. When Ben goes searching for her, he is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] (whom Kaine is working with). Though Ben appears to gain the upper hand in the ensuing fight, the Goblin manages to impale him in the back with his glider.

Miraculously, Ben survives the attack by the Green Goblin, who is revealed to be Harry Osborn, alive and well. He had been plotting his revenge against Peter since his apparent heart attack in Spectacular Spider-Man #200. Harry created a clone of his father, Norman, to help him defeat Peter and Ben; however, Norman jumps in front of Harry's Goblin Glider just as it was about to hit Peter and is impaled in the back, mirroring the events that happened to Ben in ''Spider-Man'' #75. Afterwards, Kaine returned baby May to Peter and Mary Jane, Aunt May survives and wants to help in raising little May, and Ben Reilly leaves once again to travel the world and find a life for himself.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Clone Saga'' #1-6</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Scarlet Spider made his first animated appearance on the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode "Nightmare In Green", in which [[Doctor Doom]] fools [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into believing that the [[Fantastic Four]] are his enemies. While Hulk's friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] is hanging out with [[Human Torch]], the shadowed figure of the Scarlet Spider can be seen hanging underneath a building ledge.

* Scarlet Spider's second TV appearance was made in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series. In the Season 4 episode "One Man's Worth, Part 1", he is briefly featured in one of the scenes depicting a large battle. (This happens around 7m:10s)

* Ben Reilly's alternate universe counterpart also appeared in the final season of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. In the storyline "[[Spider Wars]]", numerous versions of Spider-Man from different realities teamed up, including Ben Reilly as the Scarlet Spider. As he explains his origins, he and Spider-Carnage, the main villain of this series finale, realize they are related — Reilly is his clone or maybe Spider-Carnage is his clone. None of them are sure because the Miles Warren in their reality had robbed them of their past. Apparently, it hints that maybe Reilly is the real Spider-Man and Spider-Carnage is the clone, due to the difference in their genetic structures. In the scene where Ben explains his story involving multiple spider-clones, Spider-Man remarks, "This is starting to sound like a bad comic book plot!", an in-joke nod to the [[Clone Saga]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/episode/hateclones/ | title=Spider Wars, Part One - I Really, Really Hate Clones review | accessdate=2008-02-21 | work=Toonzone.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/episode/farewell/ | title=Spider Wars, Part Two - Farewell Spider-Man review | accessdate=2008-02-21 | work=Toonzone.net}}</ref>

* Although Peter Parker is featured as Spider-Man in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', his side-cropped hair in the series is designed similarly to Ben Reilly's hair as seen in Reilly's time as a substitute Spider-Man in the comics.

* In 1977, the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' television series episode "Night of the Clones" introduces a clone of Peter Parker, the story is very similar to that of the Clone Saga.
