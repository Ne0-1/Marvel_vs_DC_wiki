'''Detroit Steel''' is a fictional suit of [[powered armor]] appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as an adversary or rival to [[Iron Man]].  Created by writer [[Matt Fraction]] and artist [[Salvador Larocca]], Detroit Steel first appeared in ''Iron Man'' (vol 5) #25 (June 2010) as part of the "Stark Resilient" storyline. Detroit Steel is the first in a line of armored soldiers called the '''Steelcorps''', which is marketed by Stark's corporate rival Hammer Industries. Principal characters in storylines that have worn the armor include Lt. Doug Johnson and [[Sasha Hammer]]. Individual soldiers wearing the Detroit Steel armor have been called '''Steelmechs'''<ref name=IronMan506>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]] Part 3: The Apostate|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=506|date=September 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> or '''Hammermechs'''.<ref name=IronMan507>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Fear Itself Part 4: Fog of War|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=507|date=October 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref>

==Publication history==

Detroit Steel first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' (vol 5) #25 (June 2010), the first part of the nine-part "Stark Resilient" storyline, which saw [[Tony Stark]] as he struggled to build a new company, Stark Resilient. As Stark's previous company, Stark Industries, had already been critically damaged from terrorist attacks in the 2008 storyline "The Five Nightmares", he was ultimately forced to liquidate what was left of that company in the 2010 "Stark Disassembled" storyline, which also saw Stark removed from his position as head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] following the events of the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" crossover. Stark's plan for Stark Resilient was to begin by building a car powered by clean repulsor technology, the same technology used to power the arc reactor in his chest with which he first saved his own life in his origin story.<ref name=IronMan25>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matt Fraction]]|artist=[[Salvador Larocca]]|story=Stark Resilient Part 1: Hammer Girls|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=25|date=June 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref><ref name=MarvelSneakPeak>Mahadeo, Kevin. [http://marvel.com/news/story/11856/sneak_peek_detroit_steel "SNEAK PEEK: Detroit Steel"]. [[Marvel Comics]]. April 1, 2010</ref>

Writer [[Matt Fraction]] created Detroit Steel to embody [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] patriotism in the vein of ''[[Team America: World Police|Team America]]'',<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/> and describes the character thus:

<blockquote>He is what follows in the hole left behind by Iron Man once Tony Stark leaves the world stage. Tony hasn't been around to protect the regular interests that he might have during his time running Stark Industries or running S.H.I.E.L.D. And now that he's back, he's made it clear he doesn't want to get back into the geo-political side of things necessarily. Detroit Steel is what happens in that absence. He is a sort of [[Blackwater Worldwide|Blackwater]]-meets-[[NASCAR]] corporate-sponsored armored enhanced guy available for hire to the highest bidder for whatever cause around the round. Basically, Iron Man's worst nightmare of what he could become. An absolute perversion of everything he is.<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/></blockquote>

Though the armor exhibits the colors of the [[American flag]], Fraction states that the armor can repainted to reflect the colors of whatever country or corporation purchases them, from the [[Flag of Japan|Japanese]] [[Rising Sun Flag]]<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/> (which makes an appearance in ''Iron Man'' #27<ref name=IronMan27>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Stark Resilient Part 3: This Is What We Do|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=27|date=August 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref>) to the yellow and red colors of [[McDonald's]]. Fraction also contrasts Detroit Steel with Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor#Bleeding Edge Armor|Bleeding Edge armor]], which debuted in the same issue, by describing the latter as "sleeker, slicker and pared down", whereas the former is "bigger and better and boisterous and loud and noisy and everything else. It's like the difference between a Porsche and a Mack Truck."<ref name=MarvelSneakPeak/>

In the "Stark Resilient" storyline, Hammer Industries, led by [[Justine Hammer]] (daughter of Stark's former adversary [[Justin Hammer]]) and her daughter, [[Sasha Hammer]], not only wish revenge on Stark for the death of patriarch Justin, but see Stark as an obstacle for their product, Detroit Steel, which they hope to market globally as a new soldier for the [[post-9/11]] world. The prototype unit, Detroit Steel Mark One, is piloted by '''[[Lieutenant|Lt.]] Doug Johnson III''', who underwent surgical modifications in order to operate the armor, and also trained the other pilots in the company's '''Steelcorps''' army.<ref name=IronMan25/><ref name=IronManV5#31>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Stark Resilient Part 7: Sabot|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=31|date=December 2010|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref>
 
Detroit Steel next appears in ''Iron Man'' during the 2011 company-wide crossover storyline "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]".<ref>Richards, Dave.

Johnson is deployed in Paris, where he confronted [[Grey Gargoyle]], who has been transformed by [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] magic into Mokk: Breaker of Faith. Mokk has turned the population of the city into stone, and during his confrontation with Johnson, rips open his armor and turns Lt. Johnson into stone as well.<ref name=IronMan505>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Fear Itself Part 2: Cracked Actor|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=505|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> Sasha Hammer subsequently leads a team of '''"Steelmechs"''' into Paris, ostensibly on behalf of both the U.S. and French governments, to recover Johnson and his armor, and encounter [[Pepper Potts]] (aka Rescue).<ref name=IronMan507/> Hammer and the Steelmechs battle Rescue before they are both confronted by Mokk.<ref name=IronMan507/>

During the "Demon" storyline, Johnson is revealed to be alive, though when asked his name by a relief worker, he gives it as "Detroit Steel".

According to Hammer Industries, Detroit Steel represented "the most bleeding-edge research into man/machine spinal hybrid mechanics the world has ever seen", and incorporates technology, such as C.N.S. (Controlled Exo-Enhanciles) that would eventually be used to end paralysis caused by [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]], [[thoracic]] or [[corticospinal]] [[Spinal cord injury|injuries]].

The suit allows its users to fly, and usually is seen with a [[rotary cannon]] mounted on its right arm, and a specialized chainsaw on its left,<ref name=IronMan25/> which can penetrate Iron Man's armor.<ref name=IronManV5#32/> There are rocket-powered munitions on the suit's shoulders.<ref name=IronMan25/> The rotary cannon can be dismounted so that the soldier can carry and fire it as a traditional handheld weapon,<ref name=IronMan508>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Fear Itself Part 5: If I Ever Get Out Of Here|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=508|date=November 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> and users of the armor have been seen outfitted with other types of weapons in this manner, including both [[directed-energy weapon]]s and scaled-up rifles.<ref name=IronMan507>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Fear Itself Part 4: Fog of War|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=1|issue=507|date=October 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> Sasha Hammer's armor has also been observed to have a directed-energy weapon in palm of its hands.<ref name=IronMan508/> Those who pilot the armor are required to undergo considerable surgical modifications, which leave implants visible on the pilot's chest, which Lt. Johnson, who first piloted the Mark One, felt "turned him into a monster". According to Justine Hammer, the company designed models for different environments and [[hot zone]]s, including arctic climates and urban encounters.<ref name=IronMan25/> Suits of different heights and designs have also been revealed.<ref name=IronMan511/>

During the "Stark Resilient" storyline, Detroit Steel was aided in his attack against Iron Man by a fleet of unmanned flying drones that were operated by anonymous users duped into believing that the missions they were carrying out on behalf of Hammer Industries were a video game, playable via a cell phone [[Application software|application]], in which they pretended to be Detroit Steel's "[[Wingman (social)|wingman]]".<ref name=IronManV5#29-33>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|artist=Salvador Larocca|story=Stark Resilient|title=The Invincible Iron Man|volume=5|issue=29-33|date=October 2010-February 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref><ref>Tabu, Hannibal.

==Reception==
Alex Evans, reviewing ''Invincible Iron Man'' #33 for [[Weekly Comic Book Review]], while praising the "Stark Resilient" storyline, including issue #33 (which he gave a [[Grade (education)#United States|B-]]), found the [[Justine Hammer|Justine]] and [[Sasha Hammer]] to be more effective villains than Detroit Steel, which he found to be "bland" and "boring". Evans also disliked the lack of a resolution to Steel and Iron Man's battle in that issue,<ref name=WeeklyCBReview2>Evans, Alex. [http://weeklycomicbookreview.com/2010/12/24/invincible-iron-man-33-review/ "Invincible Iron Man #33 – Review"]. Weekly Comic Book Review. December 24, 2010</ref> though he later praised ''Iron Man'' #505, which he felt tied up that loose end.<ref name=WeeklyCBReview1/>
