==Fictional character biography==
Carlie Cooper is the roommate and best friend of [[Menace (comics)|Lily Hollister]]. She is an officer of the NYPD's Crime Scene Unit.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man #546''</ref> They grew up together, although Carlie was the brighter of the two.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man #586''</ref> She campaigned vigorously for Bill Hollister, who she considers a father figure. Her father, Ray Cooper, is a deceased well-respected cop. 

While preparing a body found in the river for the Medical Examiner, she finds a spider-tracer in its mouth, which initiates the police warrant for the "Spider-Tracer Killer" (believed by most to be Spider-Man). 

She was kidnapped by Dr. Rabin, who wanted to use her as a human sacrifices for ancient Mayan god. Carlie is bound, gagged, and then dragged into a blizzard but before Rabin can kill her,  Spider-Man saves her and defeats the crazed Doctor.

She later discovers that the "Spider-Tracer Killer" is a conspiracy by a group of New York cops, who have planted the tracers on dead bodies to frame Spider-Man in a smear campaign by turning the public against him. Carlie informs the precinct's sergeant, who is a part of the conspiracy and has a warrant placed for her arrest, claiming that she is aiding and abetting the killer.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #585</ref> She goes to Lily and Bill Hollister, and tells him the truth of the tracer killings. She escapes the police with the help of Menace. Later, Vin finds her and apologizes to her for all he's done. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref>

==Other versions==
In the world of the [[MC-2]] Universe, Carlie appeared within the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #4. She was the one that gave Peter the inspiration to work with the police, which he currently does within the pages of [[Spider-Girl]].
