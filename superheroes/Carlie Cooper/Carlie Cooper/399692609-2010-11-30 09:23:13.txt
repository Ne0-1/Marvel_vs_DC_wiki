==Fictional character biography==
Carlie Cooper is the roommate and best friend of [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]. She is an officer of the NYPD's Crime Scene Unit.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #546</ref> They grew up together, although Carlie was the brighter of the two.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref> She campaigned vigorously for Bill Hollister, who she considers a father figure. Her father, Ray Cooper, is a deceased well-respected cop.

While preparing a body found in the river for the Medical Examiner, she finds a spider-tracer in its mouth, which initiates the police warrant for the "Spider-Tracer Killer" (believed by most to be Spider-Man).{{Issue|date=October 2010}}

She later discovers that the "Spider-Tracer Killer" is actually a conspiracy by a group of New York cops, who have planted the tracers on dead bodies to frame Spider-Man in a smear campaign by turning the public against him. Carlie informs the precinct's sergeant, who is a part of the conspiracy and has a warrant placed for her arrest, claiming that she is aiding and abetting the killer.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #585</ref> She goes to Lily and Bill Hollister, and tells him the truth of the tracer killings. She escapes the police with the help of Menace. Later, Vin finds her and apologizes to her for all he's done. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref>

Recently Carlie was accused of tampering with evidence, when several pieces of evidence collected from three murder scenes mysteriously disappeared from the police evidence locker.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #615</ref> Spider-Man discovered that the 'evidence' was really pieces of the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and left the evidence locker on its own.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #616</ref> Carlie was cleared but is still looked down on by some fellow officers.<ref name="AMZ618">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #618</ref>

She then cuts her hair and decides to be more assertive in her life.

After many near misses and almost dates, Carlie and Peter finally set up a real date at meet at the Coffee Bean. Harry and MJ happen to be there and the two girls get talking, when all of a sudden Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains.
