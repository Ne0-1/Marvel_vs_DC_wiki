==Fictional character biography==
===Brand New Day===
{{Main|Spider-Man: Brand New Day}}
Carlie Cooper is the roommate and best friend of [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]; they grew up together, although Carlie was the brighter of the two.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref>  She is an officer of the NYPD's Crime Scene Unit.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #546</ref> She campaigned vigorously for Bill Hollister, who she considers a father figure. Her father, Ray Cooper, is a deceased well-respected cop. As a child, she was also friends with [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref>''The Many Loves Of The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1</ref>

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #555-557, she is kidnapped by Dr. Rabin, who intends to use her as a human sacrifice for an ancient Mayan god. Carlie is bound, gagged, and then dragged into a blizzard but before Rabin can kill her, Spider-Man saves her and defeats the crazed Doctor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #555-557</ref>

While preparing a body found in the river for the Medical Examiner, she finds a [[spider-tracer]] in its mouth, which initiates the police warrant for the "Spider-Tracer Killer".{{Issue|date=October 2010}} She later discovers that the "Spider-Tracer Killer" is a conspiracy by a group of New York cops, who have planted the tracers on dead bodies to frame Spider-Man in a smear campaign by turning the public against him. Carlie informs the precinct's sergeant, who unbeknownst to her, is a part of the conspiracy and has a warrant placed for her arrest, claiming that she is aiding and abetting the killer.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #585</ref> She goes to Lily and Bill Hollister, and tells him the truth of the tracer killings. She escapes the police with the help of Menace. Later, Vin finds her and apologizes to her for all he's done. <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref>

When Doctor Octopus tries using his Octobot technology to turn New York into his own living weapon, Carlie and Norah Winters investigate who is responsible and through the course of their investigation, stumble upon Doc Ock's lair.  Unbeknownst to them, Doc Ock already had kidnapped J. Jonah Jameson Sr., after being infuriated that JJJ Sr. was going to marry his old flame, Peter's Aunt May, which Spider-Man arrives to foil Doc Ock's plan{{what|date=December 2011}} by freeing all three of Doc Ock's captives with the aid of the [[Human Torch]]. Afterwards she attended the wedding with Johnny Storm as her date.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600</ref> 

Later Carlie was accused of tampering with evidence, when several pieces of evidence collected from three murder scenes mysteriously disappeared from the police evidence locker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #615</ref> Spider-Man later discovers that the 'evidence' was actually pieces of the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], which left the evidence locker on their own.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #616</ref> Carlie was cleared, but is still looked down on by some fellow officers.<ref name="AMZ618">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618</ref>

It is discovered that Carlie's father did not die.<ref name="AMZ618"/> He speaks to Carlie while she is watching a fight between the Magia family and [[Mr. Negative]]'s Inner Demons.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #619</ref> When Carlie learns that her father was not the good cop he was made out to be, she has him arrested. She then cuts her hair and decides to be more assertive in her life.

After several near misses and almost-dates, Carlie and Peter finally set up a real date at the Coffee Bean. Harry and MJ happen to be there and the two girls get talking, when all of a sudden Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains. MJ asks Carlie to help Lily, who's gone into labor, but they are held captive by Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> After this, Spider-Man manages to save them and rescue Lily's newborn infant from the supervillains. Later, Harry and Mary Jane take Lily to safety, but Carlie was too angry with Lily and instead focused her energy on trying to find Peter. She is confronted by [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643</ref> The police arrive and Tombstone escapes, but later doubles back to follow her after discovering that Carlie knows who Menace really is. Carlie, Mary Jane, and Lily are able to defeat Tombstone when he attacks them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref>

Afterwards, Peter and Carlie continue to hang out for a time but Peter has not found the courage to ask her out, leaving Carlie fuming. She gives him an ultimatum and after seeing her at Harry's going away party, Peter asks her to be his girlfriend. The two kiss and begin dating.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647</ref>

===Big Time===
{{Main|Spider-Man: Big Time}}
Peter and Carlie have now been dating for a short while. When [[Michele Gonzales]] moves back to Chicago, Peter considers moving in with Carlie but she decides that it is too early in the relationship. It is at this time that Peter discovers Carlie is a [[roller derby]] participant, using the sport to help her unleash any pent up anger. Her roller derby name is "Crusher Carlie".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref> 

When Peter is called out on a mission with the [[Future Foundation]] he tells Carlie he is going away on a business trip for his new job at Horizon Labs. Carlie is very angry when she finds out that there was no trip. She takes her rage out in the rink which results in her being sent off mid-game for a vicious assault on "Iron Mavis" from the other side. Noticing her bad mood, two of her teammates offer to take her out for a night on the town. After [[Alcohol intoxication|getting drunk]], Carlie decides to get a [[tattoo]] of the [[Green Goblin]]'s [[Green Goblin (set index)#"Goblin Gangs"|insignia]] to spite Peter, knowing his opinion of Norman Osborn (as he had murdered Peter's first girlfriend Gwen Stacy).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659</ref> However, she changes her mind and gets a tattoo of Spider-Man. She is worried that the tattoo will make things awkward between herself and Peter, but he assures her that it is not the case.<ref name="ASM660"/>

During the "Return of Anti-Venom" storyline, Carlie correctly deduces that the new Wraith is her Police captain Yuri Watanabe due to using a mask Mysterio created that could impersonate the face of the late Jean Dewolff since only they and Spider-Man knew about it. This becomes more obvious when she visited evidence storage and learned of a mysterious incident that supposedly destroyed the mask with Watanabe being the last visitor beforehand. Having secretly placed her cell phone into Watanabe's pocket earlier and following her, Carlie's suspicions were confirmed. Rather than turn Watanabe in like she previously did to Vin and her father, Carlie agrees to keep it secret and suggests that Watanabe needs to improve on covering her tracks for her own safety. <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663-664</ref>

===Spider-Island===
{{Main|Spider-Island}}
During the events that lead to the Spider-Island storyline, Carlie confronts Peter about his connection to Spider-Man, and accepts his explanation that he designs all of Spider-Man's technology.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #664</ref> She later gains spider-powers due to the Jackal's genetically-altered bedbugs, with the addition of organic webs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #667</ref> However, her mutation, like the millions of others in New York City, turns her into a monstrous spider-being.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref> She and the rest of the civilian population were eventually cured when Spider-Man uses Dr. Octopus' octo-bots to disperse the antidote.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672</ref> When she returns to normal, Carlie breaks up with Peter after deducing that he is Spider-Man, furious that she has been lied to once again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #673</ref> She and Peter are on a sort of truce as she requires Spider-Man's help in order to investigate the death of a gothic teen who died from falling from a great height and was ruled as a suicide.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #674</ref> Carlie works the case without police approval, putting her at odds with Chief Pratchett. Shortly after the case is resolved, Carlie, still conflicted over her feelings for Peter, confides in Peter's best friend and ex Mary Jane despite her initial anger over MJ also knowing Peter's identity.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC-2]] Universe Carlie gave Peter the inspiration to work with the police, which he currently does within the pages of [[Spider-Girl]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #4</ref>
