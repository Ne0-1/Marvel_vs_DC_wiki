'''Anna Maria Marconi''' is a fictional scientist appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She was initially depicted as a love interest of [[Spider-Man]], notably during his time when his body was taken over by [[Doctor Octopus]]'s mind. She has since been depicted as a close friend to Peter Parker after he regains his mind.

==Publication history==
Anna Maria Marconi first appeared in ''The Superior Spider-Man'' #5 (May 2013) and was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Giuseppe Camuncoli]].

The basis for Anna Maria Marconi came from Slott's desire to introduce a character the could cause some friction in Peter's personal life. He found this difficult to pull off as he couldn't find any reason why a character like [[Betty Brant]] or [[Aunt May]] could be bigoted or racist. Rather than having anyone of them have such a fierce trait, he had May's opinion of Peter dating Anna Maria be that of concern:

{{quote|Having Aunt May not be perfect is interesting. And when Aunt May is talking about this, it doesn’t sound like a prejudice. It’s a concerned grandma, wondering what her grandchildren are going to be like, and being ignorant. Aunt May did have cause to dislike the woman...Anna Maria does the worst possible thing you can do to Aunt May, which is to serve wheat cakes. She uses Aunt May’s recipe and improves on them.}}

He also found it relieving that Peter's mind was taken over by Otto Octavius as he felt that the character was more open-minded than Peter:

{{quote|With Anna Maria, it was fun to have this character who never knew Peter. And you quickly see that the things that she likes are Otto...You look at Otto, and he really sees people for who they are inside, and everyone he has chosen to love and be with, there’s something very neat about that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2016/01/word-balloon-dan-slott-talks-lot-and-we.html|title=Word Balloon Dan Slott Talks A Lot And We Like It|last=Suintres|first=John|website=Word Balloon|date=January 7, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Anna Maria Marconi is a young woman with [[Dwarfism|dwarfism]] who attends [[Empire State University]]. At the time when his mind was in Peter Parker's body, [[Doctor Octopus]] visits her to become his tutor for his physics class so he can earn his doctorate. The two share great admiration for each other and the next day, "Otto" pulls a rather brutal prank on a group of bullies that were taunting her for her size.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #5-6</ref> The two set up a date together that ends with "Peter" saving Anna Maria from [[Dry ice|dry ice]] and kissing her.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #10</ref> However, she too falls under the same worry umbrella as many of Peter's friends and family due to his frequent absences.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref><ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #15</ref> Later, Anna Maria accepts "Otto's" offer to join [[Parker Industries]] and afterwards, successfully helps him earn his doctorate.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #20-21</ref> 

Anna Maria eventually meets [[Aunt May]] who despite her friendliness, causes some concern when she asks about her height. She later confides in "Peter" that she feels that their evening together was her fault because she had hurt the relationship between him and May.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #23-24</ref> During the events of ''Goblin Nation'', Anna Maria was kidnapped by the [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]] who had deduced that "Peter" was really Otto. [[Norman Osborn]] as the newly christened Goblin King held her hostage to lure his [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] form out. However, Otto had given up his mind and let Peter take control of Spider-Man and he successfully rescued Anna Maria.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28-31</ref> She reveals to Peter that she had deduced that he was Spider-Man and that "he" planned on proposing to her, but is shocked to learn that Otto Octavius was the one she was in love with. After baking him cookies (baking helps her think) she leaves to clear her head. She soon meets back up with Peter at Parker Industries to help him with some of Otto's work and continues to help Peter on a platonic basis.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #1-3</ref>

Anna Maria still continues to worry for Peter, not necessarily due to his safety, but because his absences have caused some to lose faith in the company. To remedy this Peter promotes Anna Maria to ensure safety with the company.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #3-6</ref> Anna Maria also patches up her past conflict with May, who until recently did not know that she and Peter had broken up. It is also revealed that she and [[Sajani Jaffrey]], a co-worker at Parker Industries, have been working on nano-tech research, mostly due to Sajani feeling that Peter keeps too many secrets to himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #18</ref> Anna Maria is later sent to work at Parker Industries' European Division under Sajani. Unbeknownst to Anna Maria, Sajani had infused [[Living Brain]] with the consciousness of Otto Octavius which had the caused the robot to act clingy around her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #1</ref> Later, She gets Sajani's position after she is fired by Peter for conspiring against him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #5</ref>

Since then, Anna Maria and Living Brain have been acting as something akin to Spider-Man's sidekicks, helping him whenever he needs them. Slowly, Living Brain's Otto Octavius persona becomes more and more active as he grows jealous of Peter and fellow subordinate Aiden Blain's closeness to Anna Maria. Otto soon enacts his plan by getting rid of Aiden and then pretending to be faulty by attacking Peter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #9-11</ref>

During the events of ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'', Anna Maria helped Peter battle the new [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] who was actually [[Ben Reilly]]. When Horizon High was attacked by [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and the female [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. They retrieve Gwen Stacy's clone and Kaine as Anna Maria Marconi also volunteers to come with since she's studied both Kaine and the drug.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3</ref> Anna Maria is brought into the lab and becomes uncomfortable when Doctor Octopus starts appealing toward his love interest.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4</ref> When Spider-Man makes it to the lab amongst the clones starting to break down, Anna Maria tells him that she's invented an inverse frequency that can fix most of the problem. Doctor Octopus fights Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency. After the frequency is broadcast, Peter and Anna check the building and see that Jackal, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been reduced to dust. Anna notes that the "Proto Clone," or "Ultimate Template," appears missing. They come back to the front to check on [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman of Earth-65]]'s status.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5</ref>

==A.I. version==
When Superior Spider-Man was sent to the year 2099, he encountered Gabriel O'Hara, the brother of Miguel O'Hara and the [[Spider-Man 2099]]. In order to contact Miguel and return to his proper time, Gabriel aids Superior Spider-Man in creating an A.I. named Anna, who is made to resemble Anna Maria Marconi.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32</ref> Peter has since ceased using her since the beginning of ''The Clone Conspiracy''.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #20</ref>
