The current Huntress is '''Helena Rosa Bertinelli''', who first appeared in ''Huntress'' #1 (April 1989).

===Mafia Family===
Helena Bertinelli was born into one of [[Gotham City]]'s most prominent [[Mafia]]-connected families, the Bertinellis.  While she believed her father to be Franco Bertinelli, her real father was Santo Cassamento, the [[Don (mafia)|Don]] of a rival family, who had been having an affair with her mother Maria.  When a Capo named Mandragora ordered the assassination of the entire Bertinelli family, his then-underling Cassamento sent word to spare Maria, but the assassin misinterpreted the message and left eight-year-old Helena alive instead.

In the aftermath of the assassinations, her maternal family sent her to [[Sicily]] to live with her cousins, the Asaros, a family of assassins. Psychologically scarred, Helena decided to wage war on the criminal underworld, especially the mob. From age eleven to fifteen, her cousin Sal trained her in the variety of weapons and unarmed combat techniques she would use on returning to Gotham to become the vigilante Huntress.

Years later, after some council from [[Richard Dragon]] and a little help from love-interest [[The Question]], Helena would discover the truth of her parentage and her family's slaying.  She confronted Cassamento and was told he would reveal her identity as the Huntress to the rest of the mob if she did not work for him.  To preserve her identity, she went to her mafia-connected maternal uncle, Tomaso Panessa, and made a familial request that he kill Cassamento.

===Robin===

Early in Tim Drake's career as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], he worked alongside the Huntress in the miniseries "Robin II: Cry of the Huntress."  Robin has always had a good relationship with the Huntress even when Batman hasn't. 

===Nightwing===

In the four issue "Nightwing/Huntress" mini-series, Helena partners with [[Nightwing]] on a mission against the mafia. The young heroes succumb to lust and engage in a brief but passionate affair. After they end it, Helena confesses to Nightwing that she seduced him partly because she thought it might help get her into the "boys club" of Batman's world. 

While both heroes have moved on with their lives, there is a lingering lust between them. Nightwing cares about Helena as a friend, but is frequently annoyed when she brings up their sexual past...which she does just to annoy him.  

Huntress briefly allied herself with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] while Nightwing was leading the team. At the end of this mission, it was revealed that the Huntress had slept with Nightwing's teammate, friend and rival [[Arsenal (comics)| Arsenal]] at some point.

===Untrusted===

[[Batman]] has rarely accepted the Huntress, believing her techniques to be too "unpredictable and violent."  He once sponsored her membership in the [[Justice League]] so he could keep an eye on her, but ultimately forced her to resign when she almost "crossed the line" by attempting to kill a villain on one of their missions.  

Soon after this, an [[earthquake]] leveled [[Gotham City]], the [[United States]] government declared Gotham City a "No Man's Land," and Batman disappeared.  To bring order to the city, Huntress temporarily assumed the mantle of [[Batgirl#Helena_Bertinelli|Batgirl]] (she discovered criminals feared her more than they did when she was the Huntress).  When Batman returned, he said if she failed him, she would have to give up the costume.

When Huntress, all by herself, failed to protect Batman's territory from [[Two-Face]] and his gang of over 200 criminals (while Batman himself was unconscious and tied up), he held her responsible and stripped her of the Batgirl mantle. 

Later, in the final days of the "No Man's Land" storyline, Huntress was shot several times by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] when she prevented him from kidnapping and murdering the newborn [[infant]]s of Gotham City.  She almost died, but this seemed to earn her Batman's respect.  However, this was only temporary; after the "No Man's Land" storyline ended and she recuperated, Batman and his "family" became distant and combative again when she was framed for a series of murders.

===Birds of Prey===
More recently, the Huntress became involved with both [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] and [[Black Canary]] in the comic series ''[[Birds of Prey]]'',  becoming close friends with Black Canary in the process.  However, she left the small team when she believed Oracle was manipulating her. 

Following [[Black Canary]]'s asking her for aid in a battle against the Silk Brothers (twelve fighters said to be on par with [[Lady Shiva]]) and [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]]'s move to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Huntress came to terms with Barbara's actions and returned to the team. She currently appears in an ongoing subplot dealing with her attempts to take down the Gotham mafia internally by parlaying her family heritage into a position as a capo.

==Golden Age Huntress (Tigress)==
:{{main|Tigress (comics)}}
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Huntress was a [[supervillain]] with the real name of '''Paula Brooks''' who battled the [[superhero]] [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], first appearing in ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #68; initially, she sought to add Wildcat to her collection of [[big game]] trophies.

She was later [[retcon|retroactively]] renamed the '''Tigress II''' in the pages of ''Young All-Stars''. These stories took place on Earth-2 prior to her villainous career. At this point, the young Paula Brooks (approximately age 18-19) was super-heroine, and fought both Nazis and criminals alongside [[Iron Munro]], the first [[Fury (comics)|Fury]], [[Neptune Perkins]], [[Tsunami (comics)|Tsunami]], and [[Dyna-Mite]]. During these stories, Paula expressed a fan worship of Paul Kirk, the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. She frequently made a play for Iron Munro as well.  During a battle with the Nazi warriors known as [[Axis Amerika]], Tigress was attacked and seemingly killed by the Valkyrie known as Gudra. She came back to life (or was revived, it was unclear if she really was dead or not) with a new attitude which led to her becoming the villainous Huntress.

In the ''[[All-Star Comics]]'' two-issue mini-series of the late '90s that went under the byline "JSA Returns," Tigress was seen on the side of the law again, this time as the companion of Manhunter. 

At some point though, she moved permanently to the criminal side and became one of Wildcat's biggest foes, as well as a member of the Injustice Society. She later married [[Sportsmaster]] aka Crusher Crock, one of the biggest foes of the Golden Age [[Green Lantern]].  The two of them were known as "Mr. and Mrs. Menace" and fought Black Canary and Starman in the 1960s as well as continuing to serve as members of the Injustice Society.

Pre-Crisis, the Huntress battled the Helena Wayne Huntress and was defeated.  Also pre-Crisis, an Earth-1 Huntress and Sportsmaster were revealed. They fought [[Batgirl]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in "[[Batman Family]]" and then challenged the Earth-1 superheroes to a baseball game between heroes and villains. When the heroes won, the Earth-1 Huntress and Sportsmaster reformed and weren't seen again. 

Post-Crisis, Helena Wayne never existed, so that battle did not take place. It is assumed that the Huntress and Sportsmaster vs. Batgirl and Robin battle did still take place. The softball game did not. 

At some point, Huntress and Sportsmaster had a daughter named Artemis Crock. Artemis grew up to be a supervillain much like her parents. As [[Artemis (comics)|Artemis]] she served as a member of [[Injustice Unlimited]], fighting [[Infinity, Inc.]] She later took the name [[Tigress (comics)|Tigress]] and served as part of the new Injustice Society alongside her on-again, off-again lover [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] II, [[Shiv (comics)|Shiv]], [[Solomon Grundy]], Wizard, [[Gentleman Ghost]], [[Blackbriar Thorn]] and others.  She also fought alongside [[Copperhead (comics)|Copperhead]] and [[Shadow Thief]] against [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]]. 

The Paula Brooks Huntress was last seen out of uniform at an Olympic Games-type event where her daughter Artemis competed on behalf of a villainous country.

The [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] Huntress was '''Helena Wayne''', the daughter of the [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]] of [[Earth-Two]], an alternate universe established in the early 1960s as the world where the Golden Age stories took place. Earth-Two was also the home of the Golden Age versions of various DC characters. Helena's first appearance was in ''[[All-Star Comics]]'' #69 (December 1977) and ''[[DC Super-Stars]]'' #17, which came out the same month and revealed her origin.

Helena was born in 1957 to Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle Wayne, and grew up enjoying the benefits of being in a wealthy household. As a youth, she enjoyed a thorough education, as well as being trained by her parents, [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]], to become a superb athlete. After finishing school, she joined the [[law firm]] of Cranston and Grayson, one of whose partners was [[Dick Grayson]], alias [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

In 1976, a criminal blackmailed Selina into resuming action once again as Catwoman, an act which eventually led to her death. Helena, deciding to bring the criminal responsible to justice, created a costume for herself, fashioned some weapons from her parents' equipment (including her eventual trademark, a [[crossbow]]), and set out to bring in the criminal. After accomplishing this, Helena decided to continue to fight crime, under the code name "the Huntress."

Helena soon found herself involved with the [[Justice Society of America]] (the group her father was a member of), and formally joined the group in ''All-Star Comics'' #72. Helena was also briefly associated with the superhero group [[Infinity, Inc.]].

Helena also struck up a friendship with fellow new superheroine [[Power Girl]]. In addition to Power Girl, Helena frequently worked with Robin and with a new hero named Blackwing. Some of her foes consisted of [[Thinker]], the [[Joker]], Karnage, Crimelord, Boa and Earthworm. Her lover for a time was Gotham District Attorney Harry Sims. 

She made several visits to Earth-1. Her first was in "Batman Family" #17, where she met the Earth-1 Batman, Robin, [[Batgirl]] and [[Batwoman]], and fought the Earth-1 Catwoman, [[Poison Ivy]] and [[Madame Zodiac]]. She took to calling the Earth-1 Batman her "Uncle Bruce," and built a familiar relationship with him. As a member of the Justice Society, she participated in several of the annual JLA/JSA meetings, most of which took place on Earth-1.  She also participated in the battle against the Adjusticator as part of the female force of multiple earths led by the Earth-1 [[Wonder Woman]].  Other heroines involved in this adventure included [[Zatanna]], [[Supergirl]], [[Phantom Lady]], [[Madame Xanadu]], Power Girl, [[Black Canary]], [[Wonder Girl]], [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] and [[Starfire]].  

During the 1985 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Helena was killed while attempting to save the lives of several children. After ''Crisis'' ended, Helena Wayne's existence, along with that of her parents and Earth-Two's Dick Grayson, was [[retroactive|retroactively]] erased from the remaining Earth, and the world no longer remembered her existence.

==The Huntress in other media==
*The Helena Wayne version of the Huntress appeared in the two TV specials, [[Legends of the Superheroes]], which aired in 1979. The character  was portrayed by [[Barbara Joyce]].

*The Huntress' second non-comics media appearance was as a featured character in the short-lived 2000s live-action series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.  This version of the Huntress, played by [[Ashley Scott]], was mostly based on the Bronze Age, Helena Wayne version, although she is named Helena Kyle in this series. She is the daughter of Batman, who disappeared after the death of her mother, Catwoman. The Huntress in this series worked with Oracle and Black Canary's daughter as the primary crimefighters in Gotham City. Unlike the previous versions of the Huntress, this series' version possessed low-level superpowers.

*The Helena Bertinelli version of the Huntress has appeared in the 2000s [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', primarily as the love interest and partner to [[the Question]].  She is voiced by [[Amy Acker]] and starred in the episode "Double Date."  In this episode, Huntress' thirst for revenge against the murderer of her parents, [[Steven Mandragora]], results in her expulsion from the Justice League. [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]] chase Huntress only to find her ready to kill Mandragora, until the Question talks her down and Steve's rescued son is revealed.  In the subsequent episode "Question Authority," the Huntress helps the Question uncover a government conspiracy against the League. She later rescues him, with the help of [[Superman]], from the [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus Project]] after he has been captured and tortured for information.
