The '''Huntress''' is a name used by several characters in [[DC Comics]].

The Golden Age Huntress is a [[supervillain]]ess, while the Bronze Age and Modern Age Huntresses are [[superheroine]]s. 

==Paula Brooks==
:{{main|Paula Brooks}}
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Huntress was a [[supervillain]] with the real name of '''Paula Brooks''' who battled the [[superhero]] [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], first appearing in ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #68.

She was later [[retcon|retroactively]] renamed the '''Tigress''' in the pages of ''Young All-Stars''. These stories took place prior to her villainous career. At this point, the young Paula Brooks was a super-heroine, and fought both Nazis and criminals as a [[Young All-Stars]] member.

==Helena Wayne==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: H]] -->
:{{main|Huntress (Helena Wayne)}}
The Silver Age Huntress was '''Helena Wayne''', the daughter of the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Catwoman#Golden and Silver Age versions|Catwoman]] of [[Earth-Two]], an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|alternate universe]] established in the early 1960s as the world where the Golden Age stories took place. Earth-Two was also the home of the Golden Age versions of various DC characters. 

[[Image:Helena wayne.JPG|150px|left|thumb|Helena Wayne as the Huntress.]]
Created by [[Paul Levitz]], [[Joe Staton]] and Bob Layton, her first appearance was in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #69 (December 1977) and ''DC Super-Stars'' #17, which came out the same month and revealed her origin. The bulk of her solo stories appeared as backup features in issues of ''Wonder Woman'' which were published in the early 1980s. 

Helena was trained by her parents to become a superb athlete. After finishing school, she joined the [[law firm]] of Cranston and Grayson, one of whose partners was [[Earth-Two|Dick Grayson]], alias [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

Helena began her super-hero career when a criminal blackmailed her mother into resuming action once again as Catwoman -- an act which eventually led to her death. Helena, deciding to bring the criminal responsible to justice, created a costume for herself, fashioned some weapons from her parents' equipment (including her eventual trademark, a [[crossbow]]), and set out to bring in the criminal. After accomplishing this, Helena decided to continue to fight crime, under the code name, the "Huntress." 

In ''All Star Comics'' #72, Helena formally joined the [[Justice Society of America]] where she struck up a friendship with fellow new superheroine [[Power Girl]]. As a JSA member, she participated in several of the annual JLA/JSA meetings, most of which took place on Earth-One. Helena was also briefly associated with the superhero group [[Infinity, Inc.]].

During the 1985 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Helena was killed while attempting to save the lives of several children. After ''Crisis'' ended, Helena Wayne's existence, like that of her parents and Earth-Two's Dick Grayson, was [[retroactive]]ly erased from the remaining Earth and the world no longer remembered her.

==Helena Bertinelli==
{{main|Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)}}

Following the 1985 miniseries, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the Helena Wayne version of the Huntress was removed from continuity. Due to the popularity of the character, DC Comics introduced a new version of the Huntress with the same first name and physical appearance, and with a similar costume, but with an entirely different backstory and different personality.[[Image:Huntress91.png|150px|right|thumb|Helena Bertinelli as the Huntress.]]

The Modern Age Huntress is '''Helena Rosa Bertinelli''' (also Hellena Janice Bertinelli in the miniseries ''Robin 3, Cry of the Huntress''), the daughter of one of Gotham's mafia bosses who, after seeing her entire family murdered by a mob hit, vows revenge.  During the No Man's Land she works as Batgirl, but not alongside Batman (whom the citizens believe abandoned them).

[[Batman]] considers her to be too unpredictable and violent. Others in the Batman family feel differently; [[Nightwing]] had a brief romantic fling with her, while she and [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] share a good professional relationship. Early in his career he worked with the female vigilante, and later cleared her name in a murder case. Batman sponsors Huntress's membership in the [[Justice League]],<ref>''JLA Secret Files'' #2</ref> and for some time, Huntress was a respected member of the League. Under the guidance of heroes such as [[Superman]], she grew in confidence, but was forced to resign after Batman stopped her from killing the villain [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]].<ref>''JLA'' #40</ref>

The emergence of Bertinelli as the Huntress has not kept DC from occasionally paying homage to the Helena Wayne incarnation of the character.  During a post-''Crisis'' JLA-JSA team-up, Bertinelli was so impressed with the skill and prowess of the  [[Flash (Jay Garrick)]], [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], she stated humbly, "I wanna join the Justice Society . . . ."<ref>''JLA'' #31</ref> Additionally, Power Girl sought her out for someone to talk to, even though the two have never really interacted.

The character is currently featured in the comic book [[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']] as a member of the eponymous team.  Although she is still depicted as prone to excessive violence, she has become a valuable member of the team.

== Alternate versions ==
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the Huntress among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Huntress is visually similar to the Helena Wayne Huntress.<ref>

The Huntress's first appearance outside of comics was in the [[1979 in television|1979]] [[NBC]] ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' TV specials, with actress [[Barbara Joyce]] portraying the character. Huntress and [[Black Canary]] are the only two superheroines featured among a cast of some of DC's biggest heroes, including [[Batman]], the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].

===''Justice League Unlimited''===
[[Image:Huntressani.png|left|Huntress, as she appears in ''Justice League Unlimited''.|150px|thumb]]
The Helena Bertinelli version of the Huntress has appeared in the [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', primarily as the love interest and partner to [[Question (comics)|The Question]]. She is voiced by [[Amy Acker]] of ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'' and starred in the episode "Double Date". In this episode, Huntress' thirst for revenge against the murderer of her parents, [[Steven Mandragora]], results in her expulsion from the Justice League. [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]] chase Huntress only to find her ready to kill Mandragora, until the Question talks her down and Steve's rescued son is revealed. In the subsequent episode "Question Authority", the Huntress helps the Question uncover a government conspiracy against the League. She later rescues him, with the help of [[Superman]], from the [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus Project]] after he has been captured and tortured for information. Huntress also appears in the fifth-season episode "Grudge Match", in which she uncovers a plot of [[Roulette (DC comics)|Roulette]]'s to use mind-controlled female Leaguers in metahuman cage matches and her rivalry with Black Canary comes to a boil. As evident from a street sign, the match is held in [[Blüdhaven]], Gotham's neighbouring city. She plays a significant role in freeing the other heroes and shutting down the organization behind the brawls. At the end of this episode, Black Canary offers to advocate that Huntress be reinstated as a League member, but Huntress graciously turns her offer down. Instead, the two decide to get the aggression out of their systems by going one last round, "best two falls out of three".

===''Birds of Prey''===
[[Image:Bop-promo.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Ashley Scott]] as the Huntress in the [[The WB Television Network|WB]]'s [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|B.O.P.]]]]
The Huntress appears as a featured character in the short-lived live-action series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''. This version of the Huntress, played by [[Ashley Scott]], was mostly based on the Silver Age Helena Wayne version, although she is named Helena Kyle in this series. She is the daughter of Batman, who disappeared after the death of her mother, Catwoman. The Huntress in this series worked with Oracle and Black Canary's daughter as the primary crimefighters in Gotham City. Unlike the previous versions of the Huntress, this series' version possessed low-level superpowers (occasional enhanced strength and agility, accompanied by her eyes turning cat-like) and did not wear a mask or a consistent costume, preferring fashionable black clothing, usually with some kind of long leather over coat.

===''Batman Beyond''===
While nothing came of it, there was consideration of bringing Helena Wayne/Huntress into ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', as it would make a good alternative to having a ''Batgirl Beyond''.<ref>[http://jl.toonzone.net/huntress/huntress.htm Huntress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===''Justice League Heroes''===
Huntress is an unlockable player character in the 2006 [[video game]] ''[[Justice League Heroes]]''.

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
Huntress will appear in the upcoming series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''.

===''LEGO Batman''===
[[LEGO]] pieces to create Huntress can be unlocked in the character creation feature in ''[[LEGO Batman: The Video Game]]'' after achieving 100% completition. Huntress can also be unlocked in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of the game.

===''DC Universe Online''===
Huntress is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
