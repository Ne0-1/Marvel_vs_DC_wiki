She was later [[retcon|retroactively]] renamed the '''Tigress''' in the pages of ''Young All-Stars''. These stories took place prior to her villainous career. At this point, the young Paula Brooks was a super-heroine, and fought both Nazis and criminals as a [[Young All-Stars]] member.

==Helena Wayne==

The Bronze Age Huntress was '''Helena Wayne''', the daughter of the [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman#Golden_and_Silver_Age_versions|Catwoman]] of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]], an alternate universe established in the early 1960s as the world where the Golden Age stories took place. Earth-Two was also the home of the Golden Age versions of various DC characters. Helena's first appearance was in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #69 (December 1977) and ''[[DC Super-Stars]]'' #17, which came out the same month and revealed her origin.

==Helena Bertinelli==

Following the 1985 miniseries, [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], the Helena Wayne version of the Huntress was removed from continuity. Due to the popularity of the character, DC Comics introduced a new version of the Huntress with the same first name and a similar costume, but with an entirely different backstory and different personality.

The Modern Age Huntress is '''Helena Rosa Bertinelli''', the daughter of one of Gotham's mafia bosses who, after seeing her entire family murdered by a mob hit, vows revenge.  During the No Man's Land she works as Batgirl, but not alongside Batman (who the citizens believe abandoned them).

[[Batman]] rarely accepts the Huntress, believing her to be too unpredictable and violent. Others in the Batman family feel differently; for instance, [[Tim Drake]] has a good relationship with her. Early in his career he worked with the female vigilante, and later clears her name in a murder case. Batman sponsors Huntress' membership in the [[Justice League]]<ref>''JLA Secret Files'' #2</ref>, and for some time, Huntress is a respected member of the League. Under the guidance of heroes such as [[Superman]], Helena grows in confidence but is forced to resign after Batman stops her from killing the villain [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]] <ref>''JLA'' #40</ref>.

Helena is currently a member of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]], and although still prone at times to excessive violence, she has become a valuable member of the team.

*The Huntress's first appearance outside of comics was in the [[1979 in television|1979]] [[NBC]] ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' TV specials, with actress [[Barbara Joyce]] portraying the character. Huntress and [[Black Canary]] are the only two superheroines featured among a cast of some of DC's biggest heroes, including [[Batman]], the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].
*The Helena Bertinelli version of the Huntress has appeared in the [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', primarily as the love interest and partner to [[Question (comics)|The Question]]. She is voiced by [[Amy Acker]] and starred in the episode "Double Date". In this episode, Huntress' thirst for revenge against the murderer of her parents, [[Steven Mandragora]], results in her expulsion from the Justice League. [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]] chase Huntress only to find her ready to kill Mandragora, until the Question talks her down and Steve's rescued son is revealed. In the subsequent episode "Question Authority", the Huntress helps the Question uncover a government conspiracy against the League. She later rescues him, with the help of [[Superman]], from the [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus Project]] after he has been captured and tortured for information. Huntress also appears in the fifth-season episode "Grudge Match", in which she uncovers a plot of [[Roulette (DC comics)|Roulette]]'s to use mind-controlled female Leaguers in metahuman cage matches and her rivalry with Black Canary comes to a boil. As evident from a street sign, the match is held in [[Bludhaven]], Gotham's neighbouring city. She plays a significant role in freeing the other heroes and shutting down the organization behind the brawls. At the end of this episode, Black Canary offers to advocate that Huntress be reinstated as a League member, but Huntress graciously turns her offer down. Instead, the two decide to get the aggression out of their systems by going one last round, "best two falls out of three".
*The Huntress appears as a featured character in the short-lived live-action series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''. This version of the Huntress, played by [[Ashley Scott]], was mostly based on the Bronze Age Helena Wayne version, although she is named Helena Kyle in this series. She is the daughter of Batman, who disappeared after the death of her mother, Catwoman. The Huntress in this series worked with Oracle and Black Canary's daughter as the primary crimefighters in Gotham City. Unlike the previous versions of the Huntress, this series' version possessed low-level superpowers.
*While nothing came of it, there was consideration of bringing Helena Wayne/Huntress into ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', as it would make a good alternative to having a ''Batgirl Beyond''.[http://jl.toonzone.net/huntress/huntress.htm]
*Huntress is an unlockable player character in the 2006 [[video game]]. [[Justice League Heroes]].
