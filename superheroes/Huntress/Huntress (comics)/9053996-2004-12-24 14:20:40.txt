''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]] is also the title of a television series about a female [[bounty hunter]].''


'''Huntress''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s in [[DC Comics]]' [[DC Universe|universe]].

The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Huntress was a minor [[supervillain]] who battled the [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], seeking to add him to her collection of big game trophies.  As a member of the [[Injustice Society]], she fought the [[Justice Society of America]]; during this period she met the original [[Sportsmaster]], who she later married.  She was later [[retcon|retroactively]] renamed to the '''Tigress''' in the pages of ''[[All-Star Squadron]]''.  This Huntress had no powers or unusual technology, though she was a skilled hand-to-hand fighter whose nails were sharpened like [[talon]]s.

The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Huntress was Helena Wayne, the daughter of [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]] on Earth-Two, an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|alternate universe]] in which the Golden Age superheroes of the 1930s and 1940s had continued on into the then-present day, and in some cases retired and/or had families. Her parents had married and retired by the time she reached adulthood, prompting her to take their place as the defender of [[Gotham City]]. She had no powers, but used a [[crossbow]] and other variations on her parents' equipment. She was a member of [[Infinity Inc.]] alongside the other children and successors of the original Earth-Two superheroes. After the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Earth-Two no longer exists in current [[continuity]].

The current Huntress is Helena Bertinelli, who first appeared in ''Huntress'' (volume 1) #1 ([[1989]]).  She is the daughter of a [[Mafia]]-connected criminal, Mario Bertinelli, who was killed by a rival family's assassins; in order to survive, she was trained in a variety of weapons and unarmed combat techniques.  Like her Earth-Two predecessor, she uses a crossbow and other ranged weapons.  She is a friend of [[Robin (Batman)|Robin (Tim Drake)]].  Although Batman believed her techniques to be too unpredictable and violent, he nevertheless sponsored her membership in the [[Justice League]], if only so that he could keep an eye on her. In the end, however, he had her resign when she almost 'crossed the line' by attempting to kill a villain on one of their missions. She is currently involved with both [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] and [[Black Canary]] in the comic series ''[[Birds of Prey]]''.

In the [[television series]] ''[[Birds of Prey]]'', the Huntress is Helena Kyle, the 23-year-old illegitimate daughter of the [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]]. Her mother died when she was 16, at which point she went to live with Barbara Gordon ([[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]]). Unlike previous Huntresses, Helena Kyle possesses cat-like superpowers, as in the ''Bird of Prey'' version of the DC Universe, Catwoman had superpowers, too.
