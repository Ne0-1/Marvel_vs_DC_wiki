==Fictional character biography==
'''Happy Sam Sawyer''' was assigned to the [[British Commandos]] by the U.S. Army.  He trained in parachuting in Britain in 1940 by Finley's Flying circus that comprised daredevil parachutist [[Nick Fury]] and pilot Red Hargroves where they nicknamed him Happy Sam ironically, because of his deadly serious and consistently stony demeanor.<ref>''Blitzkrieg'' ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #34</ref>  In 1942 Sawyer, who had been wounded in North Africa and was deemed unfit for combat missions, organised and led the [[Howling Commandos]], Bull McGiveney's Maulers, [[Jim Morita]]'s Nisei Squad, and Sgt Bob Jenkin's The Missouri Marauders as well as the Deadly Dozen. When artist [[John Severin]] joined ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'' with issue #44, Severin drew Sawyer as being much older and balder than his original depiction as a young man.

In a Sgt Fury annual set in the [[Korean War]], Sawyer was a Colonel, in another annual set in the [[Vietnam War]], Sawyer was a full general.

In modern times, [[Baron Strucker]] created an [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] of Sawyer that attacked the original Howling Commandos as well as [[Captain America]].  Sawyer would sacrifice himself when the LMD detonated itself while trying to gain missile navigation override codes.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #274</ref>

In the wake of his death, a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] assault [[Helicarrier]] has been named in his honor in the mini-series ''Iron Man: Hypervelocity''. There is also a Samuel J. Sawyer Memorial Veterans Hospital<ref>Young Allies 70th anniversary Special</ref>
