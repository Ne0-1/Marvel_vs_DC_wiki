'''General Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]] vol. 1 #1''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Happy Sam Sawyer''' was a U.S. Army assigned to the British Commandos.  He trained in parachuting in Britain in 1940 by Finley's Flying circus that comprised daredevil parachutist [[Nick Fury]] and pilot Red Hargroves where they nicknamed him Happy Sam due to his seriousness.<ref>''Blitzkrieg'' ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #34</ref>  In 1942 Sawyer, who had been wounded in North Africa and was deemed unfit for combat missions, organised and led the [[Howling Commandos]], Bull McGiveney's Maulers, Jim Morita's Nisei Squad, and Sgt Bob Jenkin's The Missouri Marauders as well as the Deadly Dozen. When artist [[John Severin]] joined ''Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos'' with issue #44, Severin drew Sawyer as being much older and balder than his original depiction as a young man. 

In modern times, [[Baron Strucker]] created an [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] of Sawyer that attacked the original Howling Commandos as well as [[Captain America]].  Sawyer would sacrifice himself when the LMD detonated itself while trying to gain missile navigation override codes<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #274</ref>.

In the wake of his death, a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] assault [[Helicarrier]] has been named in his honor in the mini-series ''Iron Man: Hypervelocity''.
