==Fictional character biography==
'''Happy Sam Sawyer''' was trained in parachuting in Britain in 1940 by Finley's Flying circus that comprised daredevil parachutist [[Nick Fury]] and pilot Red Hargroves where they nicknamed him Happy Sam due to his seriousness.  In 1942 Sawyer organised and led the [[Howling Commandos]], Bull McGiveney's Maulers, Jim Morita's Niesi Squad, and Sgt Bob Jenkin's The Missouri Marauders as well as the Deadly Dozen.  In modern times, [[Baron Strucker]] created an LMD of Sawyer that attacked the original Howling Commandos as well as [[Captain America]].  Sawyer would sacrifice himself when the LMD detonated itself while trying to gain missile navigation override codes<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1 #274</ref>.
