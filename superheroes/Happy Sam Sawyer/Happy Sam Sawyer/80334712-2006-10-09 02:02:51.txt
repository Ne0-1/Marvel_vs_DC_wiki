'''General Samuel "Happy Sam" Sawyer''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos vol. 1 #1''.

==History==
'''Happy Sam Sawyer''' was formerly a member of Finley's Flying circus alongside [[Nick Fury]] and [[Red Hargroves]].  During his years as a circus performer, he was nicknamed Happy Sam by Fury and Hargroves.  During [[World War II]], he helped organise the [[Howling Commandos]], the [[Deadly Dozen]] and led the [[Maulers]] and the [[Missouri Marauders]].  In modern times, [[Baron Strucker]] created an LMD of Sawyer that attacked the original Howling Commandos as well as [[Captain America]].
