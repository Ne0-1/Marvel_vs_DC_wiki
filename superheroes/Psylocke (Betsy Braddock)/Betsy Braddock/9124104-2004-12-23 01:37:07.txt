'''Psylocke''' (real name '''Elisabeth Braddock''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[comic book]] ''[[X-Men]]''.

== Powers ==

Psylocke was a [[telepathy|telepath]]. The most common usage of her powers was the manifestation of a "psychic knife," described as "the focused totality of her psychic powers," which she often used to disrupt the neurons of her foes by driving the glowing red blade into their skulls. At one point she gained [[telekinesis]] through circumstances as of yet unexplained.

== History ==

Elisabeth "Betsy" Braddock was the sister of [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]], and first appeared in his series, ''Captain Britain''.  Eventually, she dyed her hair purple and became a fashion [[model (person)|model]], and secretly worked for the psi-division of S.T.R.I.K.E., Britain's version of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  One of her assignments was to infiltrate the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], but [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] forced her to abandon the mission.  A British crime lord, [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], hired [[Slaymaster]] to destroy the psi-division, and he managed to kill all but Betsy, her lover Tom Lennox, and their friend Alison Double before Captain Britain defeated him.

When reality warped due to James Jaspers's powers, Tom sacrificed himself to delay a group of superhuman-hunters to let the Braddocks escape.  Following the repair of the reality warp, an evil version of Captain Britain from another universe named Kaptain Briton switched places with Brian, handed him over to the [[Technet]] (who were after the Kaptain), and tried to rape Betsy.  In self-defence, she fried his brain, killing him.

Betsy assumed his uniform and received training from Captain UK, another alternate Captain Britain, and became Captain Britain II while Brian was away, working for the covert British agency R.C.X. Vixen lured Betsy into a trap, where Slaymaster beat her almost to death, gouging out her eyes. Summoned by his sister's [[telepathy|telepathic]] distress call, Captain Britain crushed Slaymaster's head under a rock.

[[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] and [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] kidnapped her and implanted her with [[bionics|bionic]] eyes, gave her the name "Psylocke", and made her the star of the ''Wildways'' program.  The [[New Mutants]] got involved, rescuing Psylocke from Mojo, and took her back with them to [[Westchester]].  She decided to stay with the [[X-Men]] and learn how to better control her powers.

Her role in the ''[[Mutant Massacre]]'', including pulling information about [[Mister Sinister]] from [[Sabretooth]]'s mind, led to her induction into the X-Men.  She was among the X-Men as they fought the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]] in [[Dallas]], in the event known as ''[[The Fall of the Mutants]]'', and subsequently transported to the [[Australia|Australian]] [[Outback]] by [[Roma]].  After a fight with the [[Reavers]], Psylocke donned body [[armor|armour]] to protect herself in physical confrontations.

After going through the ''[[Siege Perilous]]'', Psylocke was found by the [[Hand]], a clan of [[ninja]], whose leader, [[Matsu'o Tsurabaya]], contacted Spiral to swap the mind of his brain-dead lover, [[Revanche|Kwannon]], into Psylocke's body.  Spiral not only swapped their minds, but somewhat mingled them, leaving each woman with traits from both of them.  With some physical and mental conditioning, Psylocke (mostly Betsy Braddock's persona in mostly Kwannon's body) became Lady Mandarin, the Hand's prime assassin (and yet another [[nimbo]]).

When one of Lady Mandarin's missions pitted her against [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], her psychic knife attack showed her his memories of her, breaking the Hand's conditioning, and she escaped with Wolverine and [[Jubilee]], eventually going with them to [[Genosha]] on the trail of the New Mutants.  There, they encountered [[Havok]], whom Psylocke had psychically nudged through the Seige Perilous, acting as a Magistrate.  Following the defeat of [[Cameron Hodge]], the X-Men reunited and returned to [[New York]].

In [[1991]], when the X-Men split into two teams, Psylocke joined [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]'s Blue Team, and started flirting with him.  When [[Jean Grey]] found out, the two women started fighting, but were interrupted by the arrival of Kwannon, in what was Betsy's body, calling herself Revanche, and claiming to be the real Betsy.  Not even Wolverine's enhanced senses could tell them apart, and the Hand wouldn't give them any straight answers.  It took an infection of the [[Legacy Virus]] to determine that Revanche was not Betsy, and she gave Psylocke the parts of her mind and powers that Spiral had left with her, trading them for her own missing parts.

Jean trained Betsy in her telepathic powers, and Betsy started a relationship with Warren Worthington III, the [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]].  When Sabretooth critically wounded Psylocke in his escape from the mansion, Archangel and Wolverine went with [[Doctor Strange]] into the [[Crimson Dawn]] to retrieve a magical liquid that could heal her.  Side effects of the healing liquid were a red dagger-shaped [[tattoo]] over her left eye, a strange ability to slip into [[shadow]], and a cold edge to her personality.  Warren gave up a portion of his essence to free Psylocke from the evil influence of the Crimson Dawn, and the couple retired from active duty with the X-Men.

Psylocke later battled the [[Shadow King]] in a fight that disabled telepathic powers across the globe and destroyed her [[Astral]] form.  She reappeared in a shadow form, another side effect of the Crimson Dawn, invisible to the Shadow King, and tricked him into over-extending himself so she could contain him within her own mind.  To keep the Shadow King imprisoned, Psylocke had to keep her telepathic powers focused on containing him, and thus effectively lost the use of her telepathy.

During the "Six-Month Gap" before [[Chris Claremont]]'s second stint as X-Men scribe, Psylocke gained the power of telekinesis and returned to active duty.  She started flirting with Neal Sharra ([[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]), and Warren broke up with her.  Psylocke joined Storm's team to search for [[Destiny (Marvel Comics)|Destiny]]'s diaries, but was killed by Vargas.

Her body was returned to her family's estate.  Her spirit appeared to [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] in a vision, but she was attacked by a skull-faced apparition and pulled through a glowing gate.  Her ultimate fate is unknown.
