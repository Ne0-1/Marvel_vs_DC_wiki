==Character history==
[[Image:CaptainBritain13.jpg|170px|thumb|left|Betsy Braddock becomes the new Captain Britain. Cover to '''Captain Britain (volume 2) #13'''. Art by Alan Davis.]]
Elisabeth (sometimes Elizabeth) "Betsy" Braddock was born in and raised in [[England]]. Born in the small town of [[Maldon, Essex]], Betsy and her brothers had a very privileged life. She is the twin sister of Brian Braddock, better known as the superhero [[Captain Britain]] and first appeared in his eponymous series.  She dyed her hair purple and became a fashion [[model (person)|model]] and secretly worked for the Psi-Division of STRIKE, Britain's version of the US-based espionage outfit [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  One of her assignments was to infiltrate the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], but [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]] forced her to abandon the mission.  A British crime lord, [[Vixen (Marvel Comics)|Vixen]], hired [[Slaymaster]] to destroy the psi-division and he managed to kill all but Betsy, her lover Tom Lennox and their friend Alison Double before Captain Britain defeated him.

When reality warped due to James Jaspers's powers, Tom sacrificed himself to delay a group of superhuman-hunters to let the Braddocks escape.  Following the repair of the reality warp, an evil version of Captain Britain from another universe named Kaptain Briton switched places with Brian, handed him over to the [[Technet]],who were after the Kaptain and tried to rape Betsy.  In self-defense, she attacked him telepathically, killing him.

Betsy assumed his uniform and received training from Captain UK, another alternate Captain Britain and became the new Captain Britain while Brian was away working for the covert British agency RCX, which had replaced the defunct STRIKE. Vixen lured Betsy into a trap, where Slaymaster beat her almost to death, gouging out her eyes. Summoned by his sister's [[telepathy|telepathic]] distress call, Captain Britain crushed Slaymaster's head under a rock.

She was later kidnapped by the other-dimensional television producer [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] and his henchwoman, the six-armed, android sorceress [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and implanted with [[bionics|bionic]] eyes.  Giving her the name "Psylocke", Mojo made her the star of the ''Wildways'' TV program.  The [[New Mutants]], the teenage sister team of the X-Men, got involved rescuing Psylocke from Mojo and took her back with them to [[Westchester County, New York]].  She decided to stay with the [[X-Men]] and learn how to better control her powers.

Her role in the ''[[Mutant Massacre]]'', including pulling information about [[Mister Sinister]] from [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]'s mind, led to her induction into the X-Men.  She was among the X-Men as they fought the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]] in [[Dallas]], in the event known as ''[[The Fall of the Mutants]]'' and subsequently transported to the [[Australia|Australian]] [[Outback]] by [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]].  After a fight with the [[Reavers]], Psylocke donned body [[armor|armour]] to protect herself in physical confrontations.

After going through the dimensional gateway known as the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], Psylocke was found by the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], a clan of [[ninja]].  Their leader, [[Matsu'o Tsurabaya]], contacted Spiral to swap the mind of his brain-dead lover, [[Revanche|Kwannon]], into Psylocke's body.  Spiral not only swapped their minds, but somewhat mingled them leaving each woman with traits from both of them.  With some physical and mental conditioning, Psylocke, Betsy Braddock's persona in Kwannon's body with some of Kwannon's mental traits became Lady Mandarin, the Hand's prime assassin.  As Psylocke, she donned a new, more revealing costume, gained highly remarkable ninja fighting skills and attained the ability to focus her telepathy into a "psychic knife," which appeared as a dagger of energy projecting outward from her wrist.

Lady Mandarin's first mission pitted her against [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  Her psychic knife attack showed her his memories of her, breaking the Hand's conditioning and she escaped with Wolverine and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], eventually going with them to the country of [[Genosha]], which built its wealth on the basis of mutant slaves, on the trail of the New Mutants, who along with X-Men leader [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], had been kidnapped as part of the revenge of [[Cameron Hodge]], the former advisor to team X-Factor.  There, they encountered [[Havok]], whom Psylocke had psychically nudged through the Siege Perilous, acting as a Magistrate, one of the country's gestapo-like military police.  Following the defeat of Cameron Hodge, the X-Men reunited and returned to [[New York]].

In 1991, when the X-Men split into two teams, Psylocke joined [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]'s Blue Team and started flirting with him.  When [[Jean Grey]] (aka Phoenix) found out, the two women started fighting, but were interrupted by the arrival of Kwannon, in what was Betsy's body, calling herself [[Revanche]] and claiming to be the real Betsy.  Not even Wolverine's enhanced senses could tell them apart and attempts for an explanation from the Hand were unsuccessful.  It took an infection of the [[Legacy Virus]] to determine that Revanche was not Betsy and she gave Psylocke the parts of her mind and powers that Spiral had left with her, trading them for her own missing parts.  Phoenix trained Betsy in her telepathic powers and Betsy started a relationship with Warren Worthington III, the [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]]. 

In an attempt to save Boomer, now known as [[Meltdown (comics)|Meltdown]], from Sabretooth, Psylocke was critically wounded by the homicidal mutant who happened to be immune or at least resistant to telepathy at the time of their battle. In a bid to save her life, Archangel and Wolverine went with [[Doctor Strange]] into the [[Crimson Dawn]] to retrieve a magical liquid that could heal her. The mission was successful although the healing liquid  produced side effects: a red dagger-shaped [[tattoo]] over her left eye, a strange ability to slip into [[shadow]] and a cold edge to her personality.  Warren gave up a portion of his essence to free Psylocke from the evil influence of the Crimson Dawn, although she still retained the abilities associated with it. The couple retired from active duty with the X-Men.

Psylocke later battled the powerful telepath known as the [[Shadow King]] in a fight that disabled telepathic powers across the globe and destroyed her [[Astral]] form.  She reappeared in a shadow form, another side effect of the Crimson Dawn, invisible to the Shadow King and tricked him into over-extending himself so she could contain him within her own mind.  To keep the Shadow King imprisoned, Psylocke had to keep her telepathic powers focused on containing him and thus effectively lost the use of her telepathy.

During the six-month story gap before [[Chris Claremont]]'s second stint as ''X-Men'' scribe, Phoenix attempted to help Psylocke deal with the Shadow King, and ended up with the two switching powers, so Psylocke's telepathic powers were added to Phoenix's telepathy, and Psylocke gained Phoenix's telekinesis. Psylocke returned to active duty.  She started flirting with Neal Sharra, [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird III]] and Warren broke up with her.

Psylocke then joined [[Storm (comics)|Storm]]'s team, the [[X-Treme X-Men]], to search for [[Destiny (Marvel Comics)|Destiny]]'s diaries. On one of the team's first missions, she died fighting the man known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] while protecting [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who were badly beaten by the villain.

Her body was returned to her family's estate.  Her spirit appeared to [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] in a vision, but she was attacked by a skull-faced apparition and pulled through a glowing gate.  

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #455 Psylocke made a miraculous return, though how she survived is still unexplained. She is also apparently more powerful than before. She also now lacks the red tattoo she gained from the Crimson Dawn.

Shortly after her mysterious return, she and the rest of the X-Men found themselves in an adventure in the [[Savage Land]]. During this mission Psylocke displayed more creative uses for her powers, most notably the augmentation of her physical strength by using her telekinesis to back up her attacks. Another notable change was how she became immune or at least highly resistant to telepathic attacks and detection.

After medical tests by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] during her return to the [[X-Mansion]], it was proven that she is indeed Elisabeth Braddock. She officially rejoined the team and was reunited with her other teammates.

When the Scarlet Witch's reality warp altered the entire 616 universe in the House of M, Elisabeth Braddock became princess Elisabeth Glorianna Braddock, an adventurer and member of England's royalty.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:xtreme2.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Cover to '''X-Treme X-Men #2'''. Art by Salvador Larroca.]]Psylocke was initially a [[telepathy|telepath]]. She was capable of reading minds, controlling thoughts, casting mental illusions, attacking an enemy's mind and so on. In her early days when she still had her original [[whites|Caucasian]] body, she deployed traditional telepathic attacks in battles. She was not a skilled hand-to-hand combatant during this stage, so she relied on fighting from a distance using psi-blasts and similar tactics. 

After her physical transformation into an Asian ninja assassin, she gained highly remarkable fighting skills in addition to her telepathy, which at this stage wasn't as strong as it had originally been before her transformation since Kwannon still possessed some of her power. In a later stage of her career, she regained her full telepathic might. The most common usage of her powers was the manifestation of a "psychic knife," described as "the focused totality of her psychic powers," which she often used to disrupt the neurons of her foes by driving the glowing "blade" of mental energy into their skulls. It is noted that during this stage she chose to fight up-close most of the time, although she could still utilize distanced telepathic assaults. After her exposure to the Crimson Dawn, she also gained the ability to [[teleport]] herself or others via shadows. Although this form of teleportation was not as controlled or precise as other variations, it could cover huge amounts of distances; on one occasion she transported the X-Men from America to [[Africa]] in a few seconds.

To keep the Shadow King imprisoned in the Astral Plane, Psylocke sacrificed the use of her telepathy and power to teleport through shadows, but gained [[telekinesis]] thanks to Phoenix ([[Jean Grey]]). At first, due to the relative newness of her telekineis, she couldn't excercise fine control over her powers (she could blast an enemy through a brick wall, but couldn't levitate a small dime). As time progressed, Psylocke grew more proficient at using her powers. Instead of her psychic knife, Psylocke can now manifest a telekinetic [[katana]] blade composed of raw psi-energy, which at its lowest intensity, functions much like her psychic knife, short-circuiting the victim's nervous sytem, and at its highest level, her katanas can slice through almost any material. Her control over her sword is so great, that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor, but leave the attacker physically unharmed (but with nasty headache) Aside from the blades, she uses her telekinesis to enhance her speed, strength and fighting skills into super-human levels. She can also move and levitate other people. While she can move objects from a distance and fly as other telekinetics do, she has shown little inclination to do either in combat situations. She can also create telekinetic shields of various sizes and strength. And she can fire mental force blasts that can "shatter mountains". Her telekinesis is also much stronger now than it was before her death. After her resurrection, writer Chris Claremont, noted that in addition to no longer having the use of her own telepathy, she is immune to any form of others' telepathy&ndash; including telepathic attacks, probes or even attempts at communication.  This is likely a result of retaining her former skills, control and willpower; despite no longer using them to temper her own telepathic energies. Her current psi-shields are also of enormous strength. It has also been hinted that Psylocke may be immune or at least highly resistant to other forms of psionic-based powers. She has also shown signs of being unaffected by certain magical spells.

==Ultimate Psylocke==
In the World Tour story arc of [[Ultimate X-Men]], Betsy Braddock was introduced. She is a psychic and, judging by Braddock's assertion, the best psychic in all of England. Her body is possessed by the Ultimate version of Proteus, but Betsy resists just long enough to allow Ultimate Colossus to drop a car on her, killing them both.

However, towards the end of the Return of the King story arc in Ultimate X-Men, Betsy has been found to have possessed the body of a young Asian girl named Kwannon. Betsy has yet to be seen again in Ultimate X-Men or any other Ultimate title.
