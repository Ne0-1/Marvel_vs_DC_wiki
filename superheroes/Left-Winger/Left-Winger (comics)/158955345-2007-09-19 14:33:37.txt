'''Left-Winger''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  

Hector Lennox was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  He was a U.S. Army veteran who grew bored during peace-time service.  He signed up for the [[Power Broker]]'s strength augmentation process, and joined the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]].  Later, his army friend John Walker, the [[U.S. Agent|Super-Patriot]], approached him to form a team of superhumans.  This new team was known as the B.U.C.s (Bold Urban Commandos) or "Buckies",  and consisted of Lennox, [[Battlestar (comics)|Lemar Hoskins]], and [[Right-Winger (comics)|Jerome Johnson]].

The Super-Patriot publicly spoke out against the original [[Captain America]], and the Buckies (who pretended to be Cap's supporters) staged opposition to Walker and pretended to attack him at a rally in [[Central Park]] as a publicity stunt.  Walker defeated these protesters and proclaimed to Captain America that the people should decide who was worthy of being Captain America.  Eventually, the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] selected Walker to replace Steve Rogers as Captain America, and chose Lemar Hoskins to become his partner Bucky (and later as Battlestar.  

Lennox and Johnson were left behind, feeling betrayed and angered.  They chose the names Left-Winger and Right-Winger respectively.  The pair upstaged the new Captain America at a press conference, revealing Walker's identity to the press out of jealousy over his new-found success.  As a result, Walker's parents were killed by the militia group [[The Watchdogs]], nearly driving Walker into a mental breakdown.  Walker blamed his former partners for his parents' deaths, and when he caught up to Left-Winger and Right-Winger, he left them to die in an exploding oil tanker.  They barely survived the explosion due to their bodies' enhanced physiology, leaving them terribly burned and in critical condition.

Left-Winger carries a torch which would ignite at the touch of a button.  It can burn through 2-inch thick steel within seconds.
