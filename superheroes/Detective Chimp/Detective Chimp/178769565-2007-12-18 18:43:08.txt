In the [[fiction]]al [[DC Universe]], '''Detective Chimp''' (alias Bobo T. Chimpanzee) is a [[Common Chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] wearing a [[deerstalker]] (in honor of [[Sherlock Holmes]]) with human-level [[intelligence]] who solves crimes, often with the help of the [[Bureau of Amplified Animals]], a group of intelligent animals, like [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. He was originally created in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], but was abandoned as an embarrassment by subsequent writers. 

In 2005 the character was revived in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries. He is now a major character in the ongoing series spun out of Day of Vengeance, ''[[Shadowpact]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
When first introduced, the Detective Chimp was a simple, although intelligent, trained chimpanzee, who acted as a "helping [[mascot]]" for the local sheriff, after helping him to solve the murder of his chimpanzee trainer, Fred Thorpe. He could not speak, but being very intelligent he could understand humans, and make himself understood. He appeared briefly with [[Angel and the Ape|Sam Simeon]] in [[Gorilla City]] during ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

This origin was elaborated on and slightly modified in ''Day of Vengeance''. There it was shown how he was captured in Equatorial Africa in 1953 by Fred Thorpe, who sought to train him for his carnival act: "Bobo the Detective Chimp". For the act, the Detective Chimp was trained to answer some detective-related questions using a combination of signals and rewards, giving the illusion that he could "discover the deepest secrets of the public". Bobo formed a strong bond with Thorpe, because he took care of him, and gave him a simpler life than in the jungle. The success of the act lasted until, during a trip in Florida, Rex, the Wonder Dog took him to the [[Fountain of Youth]], where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures, even humans, in their own language along with eternal youth. This fountain would later be boiled away by the Spectre.

At some point after this, Bobo was employed by the Bureau of Amplified Animals. It is not known how he left, or if the Bureau still exists.

After the death of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. Initially he did quite well, as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty. During this successful period he was visited by another detective, John Jones (actually the [[Martian Manhunter]], during the ''JLApe'' crisis), who thought Bobo's agency seemed to be doing better than his own.

But being an ape, without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person, he couldn't enforce unpaid bills. When the public began to forget him, he became an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]]. He also has a smoking habit. It has been revealed that Detective Chimp is a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], which entails that his Intelligence Quotient has been estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult (human) population.

It was recently revealed that he had a long-standing partnership with four other detectives, among them [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]], as the Croatoan Society.

===Shadowpact===

When the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] tries to destroy all magic and began killing wizards, Detective Chimp, while still mostly drunk, coerces a group of mystical characters, gathers from the other-dimensional Oblivion Bar, into battling the Spectre. This would be the beginning of the group Shadowpact.

Although lacking superhuman powers, Detective Chimp exhibits not only fine detective skills but also the genius of a true tactician. Benefiting from the counsel of the [[Phantom Stranger]] (newly turned into a mouse), he devised a plan to use the powers of [[Black Alice]] and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]] to confront the combined menace of [[Eclipso]] and the Spectre.

In ''Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special'', he also participates in cleaning up the demonic damage left when the Rock of Eternity explodes over [[Gotham City]]. Not only are the sentient seven sins of mankind rampaging through the city, other monsters are loose as well. Detective Chimp captures the sin of 'Sloth', which has possessed his long-time friend [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. The Rock is reformed and all magical influence cleaned out of Gotham. The remnants of [[Doctor Fate]], dying because of the Spectre, hands him the helm of fate, which despite everything, still has power. After finding it does not fit him, Detective Chimp convinces Captain Marvel to throw it to earth, to let fate choose it's next bearer.

Since these initial adventures, he has remained with the team. He personally stuck around the Oblivion Bar, a magical hangout for mystical types of all sorts. There asked by the [[Phantom Stranger]] to travel through a mystical shield surrounding the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. There they confronted the murderous villains known as the Pentacle. Detective Chimp was captured separately by his Pentacle 'counterpart' Karnevil, but manages to escape and free the team. During the resulting magical battles, Detective Chimp (and everyone else in town) sacrificed one full year of their life inside of one moment in order to bring down the barrier. Later, he discovers he was part of a Shadowpact statue that others had erected in Metropolis in order to honor the seemingly-dead team.

Despite his unwilling imprisonment in Riverrock, he is shown with the remnants of the Croatoan Society during the year long '[[52 (comic book)|52]]' event. He is also shown with several Shadowpact members and another Society member, [[Ralph Dibny]]. [[Tim Trench]], a Society member, has seemingly fallen victim to misuse of the Doctor Fate helmet. Ultimately, it is revealed Tim had been slain by [[Felix Faust]] in an attempt to mislead Ralph.

As detailed in 'Volume 2' of the 52 graphic novel collection, writer [[Mark Waid]] acknowledges the Riverrock mistake.

==Powers and abilities==
The Detective Chimp possesses no unusual physical abilities, save the level of agility and [[physical strength]] that comes with being a chimpanzee with human knowledge of movement and tools. He is capable of conversing with all animals, regardless of origin, in their own language, including all spoken and written human languages. He is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world, with detective skills rivaling those of [[Batman]] and [[Ralph Dibny]].

==Notes==
{{Trivia|date=November 2007}}
*In a 1989 issue of ''[[Secret Origins]]'', his intelligence was explained by experimentation of an alien microscopic race, and he was brought to the USA because he impressed a scientist he saved. This seems to have been [[retcon]]ned.
*According to Detective Chimp in ''Day of Vengeance'' #4, he does not consider Bobo to be his real name, which he won't reveal to protect his secret identity. It is revealed by the Phantom Stranger's narration in ''Shadowpact'' #7 to be "mostly an unpronounceable screech and three grunts", which translates as "Magnificent Finder of Tasty Grubs".
