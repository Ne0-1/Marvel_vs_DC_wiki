In the [[fictional]] [[DC Universe]], '''Detective Chimp''' (Bobo T. Chimpanzee) is a [[deerstalker]]-wearing [[chimpanzee]] (in honor of [[Sherlock Holmes]]) with human-level [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] who solves crimes, often with the help of the [[Bureau of Amplified Animals]], a group of intelligent animals, like [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. He was originally created in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], but was abandoned as an embarrassment by subsequent writers. He has recently been revived in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, and is set to be a major character in the new ongoing series ''[[Shadowpact]]'' spinning out of it.

==Character history==
===Origins===
Detective Chimp was a simple, although intelligent, trained chimpanzee, who acted as an "helping [[mascot]]" for the local sheriff, after helping him to solve the murder of his chimpanzee trainer, Fred Thorpe. He could not speak, but being very intelligent he could understand humans, and make him understood. 

This origin was elaborated on and slightly modified in ''Day of Vengeance'', where it was shown how he was captured in Equatorial [[Africa]] in 1953 by Fred Thorpe, who sought to train him for his number... "Bobo the Detective Chimp", in which Detective Chimp was trained to answer some detective-related questions using a combination of signals and rewards, giving the illusion to can "discover the deepest secrets of the public". Bobo formed a strong bond with Thorpe, because he took care of him, and gave him a more simpler life than in the jungle, until, during a trip in Florida, Rex the Wonder Dog took him to the [[Fountain of Youth]], where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures in their own language, even humans. He was also granted Eternal Youth.

After the death of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. But being a monkey without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person, he couldn't get paid, and when the public began to forget him, he became an [[alcoholic]].

===Shadowpact===
When the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] went mad under the influence of [[Eclipso]], tried to destroy all magic and went on a killing spree, killing over  700 magicians, Detective Chimp coerced a group of mystical characters into battling the  Spectre, forming a group called the[[Shadowpact]].

Although he lacked true superpowers, he exhibited not only his fine detective skills, but also the genius of a true tactician, devising, with the counsel of a newly turned into a mouse [[Phantom Stranger]] some plans to use the powers of [[Lori Zechlin|Black Alice]] and [[Nightshade_(DC_Comics)|Nightshade]] to front the combined menace of Eclipso and the Spectre.

==Trivia==
*In Secret Origins of 1989 his [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], for example, was explained by experimentation of an alien microscopic race, and was told that Detective Chimp, originally an African Chimpanzee, was brought to USA because he made a very good impression of some scientist he saved due to his genius. This seems to have been ignored since.
*According to Detective Chimp in ''Day of Vengeance'' #4, he does not consider Bobo to be his real name, which he won't reveal to protect his secret identity.
