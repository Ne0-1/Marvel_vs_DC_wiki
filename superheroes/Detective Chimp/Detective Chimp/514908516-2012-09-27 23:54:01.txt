In the [[fiction]]al [[DC Universe]], '''Detective Chimp''' (alias Bobo T. Chimpanzee) is a [[deerstalker]]-wearing (à la [[Sherlock Holmes]]) [[Common Chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]  with human-level [[intelligence]] who solves crimes, often with the help of the Bureau of Amplified Animals, a group of intelligent animals that also includes [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. He was originally created in the final years of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], during the interregnum between the former and the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Detective Chimp | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 100  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

After his initial appearance in ''Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog'' he continued to appear in that title as a backup feature until 1959, at which point he faded into obscurity. Several decades after his last appearance, Detective Chimp appeared in several cameos, namely in a 1981 story, "Whatever Happened to Rex the Wonder Dog" (''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #35) and later in a brief cameo  with [[Angel and the Ape|Sam Simeon]] in [[Gorilla City]] during 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Following these appearances, Bobo started appearing in DC titles with some regularity, appearing in issues of ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Flash]]'', and other titles. This eventually led to prominent roles in the 2005 ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries and subsequently as a regular in its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Shadowpact]]'', through the latter's last issue, #25. The character still appears as a guest-star in [[DC Comics]] titles.

==Fictional character biography==
When first introduced, the Detective Chimp was a simple, although intelligent, trained chimpanzee, who acted as a "helping [[mascot]]" for the local sheriff, after helping him to solve the murder of his chimpanzee trainer, Fred Thorpe. He could not speak, but could understand humans and make himself understood. 

The Chimp's origin has been revamped and elaborated on several times since his initial Silver Age appearances. 1989's ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (v2) #40 credited the experimentation of a microscopic alien race with Bobo's intelligence. This origin has since been [[retcon]]ned, notably in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' six part limited series. In the latter it was shown that Bobo was captured in Equatorial Africa in 1953 by Fred Thorpe, who sought to train him for his carnival act: "Bobo the Detective Chimp". For the act, the Detective Chimp was trained to answer some detective-related questions using a combination of signals and rewards, giving the illusion that he could "discover the deepest secrets of the public". Bobo formed a strong bond with Thorpe because Thorpe took care of him, and gave him a simpler life than in the jungle. The success of the act lasted until a trip to Florida, at which time Rex, the Wonder Dog, took him to the [[Fountain of Youth]], where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures, even humans, in their own language, as well as eternal youth. (Rex's and Bobo's journey to the Fountain of Youth was originally depicted in the aforementioned ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #35, July 1981.) The intelligence Bobo gained put a damper on the success of the sideshow act, and in at least once instance, he decided that a woman had in fact murdered her sister, and shared his insights with the local police.

At some point after this, Bobo was employed by the Bureau of Amplified Animals. It is not known how he left, or if the Bureau still exists.

After the death of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. Initially he did quite well, as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty. During this successful period he was visited by another detective, John Jones (actually the [[Martian Manhunter]], during the ''JLApe'' crisis), who thought Bobo's agency seemed to be doing better than his own.

However, as an ape, without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person, he couldn't enforce unpaid bills. When the public began to forget him, he became an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]]. In ''Day of Vengeance'' #5, it is revealed that he had not left the other-dimensional [[Oblivion Bar]] since [[Nightmaster|Jim Rook]] acquired it; neither had he left it at all during the previous two owners' tenures.

Bobo, a smoker, is a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and had a long-standing partnership with four other detectives as the Croatoan Society. One of the other former members of the Society was the detective/superhero [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]].

===Shadowpact===
[[Image:Dchimpx.png|Detective Chimp in modern times. A panel from ''Day of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2006), art by Justiniano.|150px|left|thumb]]
When the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] attempted to destroy all magic and began killing wizards, Detective Chimp, while still mostly drunk, coerced a group of mystical characters gathered from the Oblivion Bar into battling the Spectre. This led to the formation of the group [[Shadowpact]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Although lacking superhuman powers, Detective Chimp exhibited not only fine detective skills but also the genius of a true tactician. Benefiting from the counsel of the [[Phantom Stranger]] (at the time transformed into a mouse), he devised a plan to use the powers of [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]] to confront the combined menace of [[Eclipso]] and the Spectre.

In ''Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special'', Bobo also helped clean up the demonic damage left when the Rock of Eternity exploded over [[Gotham City]]. He captured the sin of "Sloth," which had possessed his long-time friend [[Rex the Wonder Dog]].<ref>"Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special" (March 2006)</ref> After the Rock was reformed, the sins re-imprisoned, and all magical influence cleaned out of Gotham, the dying [[Doctor Fate]] gave Detective Chimp the powerful Helmet of Fate. After finding it did not fit him, Detective Chimp convinced Captain Marvel to throw it to Earth, to let fate choose its next bearer.

Bobo has remained with Shadowpact since then, and has fought alongside them during several adventures.

In the one shot "Helmet of Fate: Detective Chimp," the helmet returned to Earth, knocking out Bobo. For a brief time Detective Chimp bonded with the helmet, which granted him additional powers that he used to assist the [[Gotham City]] police in apprehending the villain [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. After struggling against the temptation of the helmet, Bobo sent it on to another journey. 

Recently, it has been shown that Bobo occasionally assists [[Batman]] in his cases by way of a [[chat room]] where they swap theories.  [[The Riddler]] is also known to chat with them, but he is unaware of the other two's identities.

==Powers and abilities==
The Detective Chimp possesses no unusual physical abilities, save the level of agility and [[physical strength]] that comes with being a chimpanzee with human knowledge of movement and tools. He is capable of conversing with all animals, regardless of origin, in their own language, including all spoken and written human languages. He is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world, with detective skills rivaling those of [[Ralph Dibny]] or [[Batman]]. Bobo has an Intelligence Quotient estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult (human) population, as evidenced by his [[Mensa International|Mensa]] membership. For a brief time, Detective Chimp also had additional sense-expanding powers granted him by the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]].

Because a chimpanzee's muscles are much denser than a human's, Detective Chimp is unable to swim.

==True name==
According to Detective Chimp in ''Day of Vengeance'' #4, "Bobo" is not his real name, which he won't share. It is revealed by the Phantom Stranger's narration in ''Shadowpact'' #7 to be "mostly an unpronounceable screech and three grunts," which translates as "Magnificent Finder of Tasty Grubs."

==Other versions==
In ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent: Superman's Reign]]'', the Earth-9 version of Detective Chimp is revealed to be the screen name of a human hacker named [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].

In ''[[DC One Million]]'', the far future version of Detective Chimp is one of the heroes of the Gorilla Galaxy, and wears a costume similar to [[Batman]]'s.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Detective Chimp appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Golden Age of Justice" voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Unlike the comic book version who speaks with a [[Boston]] accent, this version of Detective Chimp speaks in a pronounced [[British English|English]] dialect. In the teaser, Batman and the seemingly animal-like chimp try to figure out who stole the Golden Skull. The thief is revealed to be [[False-Face]]. After False-Face is defeated, Detective Chimp surprises the people watching by revealing he could talk by telling Batman "Don't patronize me, old chum". He appears again in "Gorillas in Our Midst", helping Batman stop Gorilla Grodd when he replaces [[Gotham City]]'s human population with Gorillas. During the adventure, he expresses romantic interest in the super-heroine [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] despite her different species. In this episode, the word 'ape' is used to indicate something besides gorillas which does not include chimps or humans in spite of both being a form of ape.

===Toys===
*Detective Chimp was the 69th issue in the [[DC Comics Super Hero Collection]].

===Miscellaneous===
* Detective Chimp appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' #39, working alongside fellow detectives [[Batman]] and [[Elongated Man]]. In the [[DC Animated Universe]] continuity, Detective Chimp is portrayed as a citizen of Gorilla City, but does not actually appear until the end of the story as he'd been impersonated by [[Gorilla Grodd]] for much of the issue.
