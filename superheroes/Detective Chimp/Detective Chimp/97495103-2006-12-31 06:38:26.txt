In the [[fictional]] [[DC Universe]], '''Detective Chimp''' (alias Bobo T. Chimpanzee) is a [[chimpanzee]] wearing a [[deerstalker]] (in honor of [[Sherlock Holmes]]) with human-level [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] who solves crimes, often with the help of the [[Bureau of Amplified Animals]], a group of intelligent animals, like [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. He was originally created in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], but was abandoned as an embarrassment by subsequent writers. 

In 2005 the character was revived in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries. He is now a major character in the ongoing series spun out of Day of Vengeance, ''[[Shadowpact]]''.

==Character history==
===Origins===
When first introduced, the Detective Chimp was a simple, although intelligent, trained chimpanzee, who acted as a "helping [[mascot]]" for the local sheriff, after helping him to solve the murder of his chimpanzee trainer, Fred Thorpe. He could not speak, but being very intelligent he could understand humans, and make himself understood.

This origin was elaborated on and slightly modified in ''Day of Vengeance''. There it was shown how he was captured in Equatorial [[Africa]] in 1953 by Fred Thorpe, who sought to train him for his carnival act: "Bobo the Detective Chimp". For the act, the Detective Chimp was trained to answer some detective-related questions using a combination of signals and rewards, giving the illusion that he could "discover the deepest secrets of the public". Bobo formed a strong bond with Thorpe, because he took care of him, and gave him a simpler life than in the jungle. The success of the act lasted until, during a trip in Florida, [[Rex the Wonder Dog|Rex, the Wonder Dog]] took him to the [[Fountain of Youth]], where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures, even humans, in their own language along with Eternal Youth.

At some point after this, Bobo was employed by the Bureau of Amplified Animals. It is not known how he left, or if the Bureau still exists.

After the death of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. Initially he did quite well, as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty. During this successful period he was visited by another detective, John Jones (actually the [[Martian Manhunter]], during the ''JLApe'' crisis), who thought Bobo's agency seemed to be doing better than his own.

But being an ape, without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person, he couldn't enforce unpaid bills. When the public began to forget him, he became an [[alcoholic]]. He also has a smoking habit. It has been revealed that Detective Chimp is a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], which entails that his Intelligence Quotient has been estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult (human) population.

It was recently revealed that he had a long-standing partnership with four other detectives, among them [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]], as the [[Croatoan Society]].

===Shadowpact===
When the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] tried to destroy all magic and began killing wizards, Detective Chimp coerced a group of mystical characters into battling the  Spectre, forming a group called the [[Shadowpact]].

Although lacking superhuman powers, he exhibited not only fine detective skills but also the genius of a true tactician. Benefiting from the counsel of the [[Phantom Stranger]] (newly turned into a mouse), he devised a plan to use the powers of [[Black Alice]] and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]] to confront the combined menace of [[Eclipso]] and the Spectre.

Since this first adventure, he has remained with the team.

==Notes==
*In a 1989 issue of ''[[Secret Origins]]'', his [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] was explained by experimentation of an alien microscopic race, and he was brought to the USA because he impressed a scientist he saved. This seems to have been [[retcon|retconned]].
*According to Detective Chimp in ''Day of Vengeance'' #4, he does not consider Bobo to be his real name, which he won't reveal to protect his secret identity. It is revealed by the [[Phantom Stranger]]'s narration in ''Shadowpact'' #7 to be "mostly an unpronounceable schreech and three grunts", which translates as "Magnificent Finder of Tasty Grubs".
