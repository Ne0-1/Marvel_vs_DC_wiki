==Fictional character biography==

Dick Jones was ex-All American fullback, ex-collegiate boxing, wrestling and fencing champ. He actually has three identities: Dick Jones, reporter; Van Engen, millionaire; and Phantom Reporter, costumed crime fighter. <ref>''Daring Mystery Comics'' #3 (1940)</ref> He put on a mask so he could redress the wrongs he couldn't as a reporter.<ref>''Daring Mystery 70th Anniversary Special'' (2009)</ref>

===The Twelve===
{{Main|The Twelve (comics)}}
Jones and eleven other heroes, such as [[Blue Blade]], the first Electro and the [[Black Widow (Claire Voyant)|Black Widow]], are in Berlin during the last days of World War 2. The story starts from his perspective. Purely by chance they assemble and investigate the headquarters of the S.S. As part of a plot to reinvigorate the Nazis, they are captured and placed in suspended animation. The scientists responsible are killed in various incidents and the twelve are not found until 2008. 

To reduce the culture shock the government agency recreates life from decades ago. Jones notices oddities, such as a female nurse having earring holes and wearing bizarre stockings. This snaps the illusion for the group.<ref>''The Twelve'' #1 (2008)</ref> 

Jones also deals with his growing attraction to the Black Widow.

Soon, he is offered a job with the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. For the editors at the ''Bugle'', the Phantom Reporter's first-hand experience of America's past — specifically all the good and ill that was present — will be invaluable to their readers. He accepts the job, writing his first article on the sacrifice and patriotism of his generation of heroes.<ref>''The Twelve'' #3 (2008)</ref>
