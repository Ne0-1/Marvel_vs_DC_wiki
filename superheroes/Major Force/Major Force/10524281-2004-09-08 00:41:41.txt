'''Major Force''' is a [[comic book]] hero in the [[DC Comics]] universe.  Major Force was created around the same time as [[Captain Atom]].

Major Force was created by the [[US]] government.  The government was experimenting with the effects of [[atomic energy]] on human subjects. In the experiment they changed human cells into living energy. The energy was then put into a containment suit so that the energy could lead a near human existence.

Major Force is the closest thing to evil there is on the heroes side. He is very powerful &mdash; almost as powerful as [[Superman]].  He can fly, shoot energy beams, and absorb radiation, but he would just love to kill all who stand in the way of the government and himself. Captain Atom has had to pull rank on Major Force on several occasions to keep him in check.
