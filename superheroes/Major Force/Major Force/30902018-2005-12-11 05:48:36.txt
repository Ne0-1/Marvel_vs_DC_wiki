'''Major Force''' (Clifford Zmeck) is a fictional character, a [[comic book]] supervillain in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Captain Atom]]'' (3rd series) # 12 (February, 1988).  The issue was scripted by [[Cary Bates]] and [[Greg Weisman]], drawn by [[Pat Broderick]]. 

Major Force is a product of the same Federal government of the United States project which created Captain Atom during the [[Vietnam War]] (1957 - 1975). The government was experimenting with the effects of atomic energy on human subjects. In the experiment, they changed human cells into living energy. The energy was then put into a containment suit so that the energy could lead a near-human existence.

Major Force is a [[Misogyny|misogynist]] and a [[murder]]er. He is very powerful &mdash; almost as powerful as [[Superman]]. He can fly, shoot energy beams, and absorb radiation, but he would just love to kill all who stand in the way of the government and himself. Captain Atom has had to pull rank on Major Force on several occasions to keep him in check. 

In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (3rd series) #54 (August, 1994), Major Force killed Alexandra "Alex" DeWitt, girlfriend of newest Green Lantern Kyle Rayner and stuffed her remains in a refrigerator so that Kyle could find her. Following the murder, Rayner almost killed Major Force but was stopped by forces of the [[United States Army]]. The issue was scripted by [[Ron Marz]] and drawn by [[Derec Aucoin]], [[Darryl Banks]] and [[Steve Carr]]. This memorable demise of yet another female comic book character was seen as a pattern starting with the death of [[Gwen Stacy]] at the hands of the original [[Green Goblin]] in  ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #121 (June, 1973). This has led to coining the term [[Girlfriend-in-Refrigerator Syndrome]].

In ''[[Guy Gardner]]: [[Warrior]]'' #43 (June, 1996), Force killed [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]], a former female Green Lantern. The issue was scripted by [[Beau Smith]] and drawn by [[Brad Gorby]]. Force was apparently confronted in [[Kyoto]], [[Kyoto Prefecture]], [[Honshu]], [[Japan]]. Guy Gardner apparently killed him in revenge for the death of Arisia. In reality, Force is made of energy and not matter. He cannot die and has effectively gained immortality.
