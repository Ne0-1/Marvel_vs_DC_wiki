'''Major Force''' ('''Clifford Zmeck''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He is a [[supervillain]] that first appeared in ''[[Captain Atom]]'' vol. 3, #12 (February 1988).
 
==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Major Force is a product of the same U.S. Federal project which created [[Captain Atom]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The government, in a projected headed by [[General Wade Eiling|Wade Eiling]] and the scientist Megala, was experimenting with the effects of [[atomic energy]] on an alien metal they had taken from a crashed spaceship to determine its full protective abilities; such as protecting a human being from a nuclear blast. After the disappearance of Nathaniel Adam and the perceived failure of the Captain Atom Project, the government restarted the project with a new subject, Clifford Zmeck and increased the amount of metal used (''[[Captain Atom]]'' #36 (Dec. 89). While in the USAF, Zmeck had been jailed in a high security prison for [[rape]] and sentenced to [[life in prison]]. He was offered a [[pardon]] in exchange for participation in the high-risk governmental experiment. The results were the same as with the Captain Atom Project and Zmeck disappeared into the Quantum Field, emerging one year after the return of Nathaniel Adam. This time, the government was ready and implanted microexplosives under the metal while it was still malleable, in order to control Zmeck in case he went rogue. Introduced as an ally, then successor to Captain Atom, Force's brutality betrayed his government-concocted role of superhero and brought him in frequent conflict with Atom. Major Force is now arguably Captain Atom's arch-enemy. Eventually, he became a hired gun for General Wade Eiling's purposes.

===Crime and punishment===
In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' vol. 3, #54 (August 1994), Major Force killed [[Alexandra DeWitt|Alexandra "Alex" DeWitt]], girlfriend of the then, newest [[Green Lantern]] [[Kyle Rayner]], and stuffed her remains in a refrigerator so that Kyle could find her. Rayner almost killed Major Force, but was stopped by forces of the [[Special Crimes Unit]]. Alex's demise inspired writer [[Gail Simone]] to create the website ''Women in Refrigerators'', which in turn coined the term of the [[Women in Refrigerators|same name]].

In ''[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]: [[Warrior]]'' #43 (June, 1996), Force killed [[Arisia (comics)|Arisia]], a former Green Lantern and dear friend of [[Guy Gardner]]. Force was apparently confronted in [[Kyoto]],  [[Japan]]. [[Guy Gardner]] seemingly kills him in revenge. In reality, Force is made of energy and not matter. He cannot die and has effectively gained immortality.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 and #4 (December 2003 and January 2004), Force is part of a Government Task Force led by Captain Atom, in addition to Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], [[Power Girl]] of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], Japanese superhero [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and retired superhero [[Black Lightning]]. He is saddled with Captain Atom by President [[Lex Luthor]] in order to bring in [[Superman]] when a [[Kryptonite]] asteroid was headed for Earth. Superman and [[Batman]] escape them in [[Washington]] but met up with them again in [[Tokyo]]. Power Girl and Katana reveal they are double agents working with Superman and Batman the whole time. When Captain Atom and his squad pursue them to Japan, Power Girl strikes at the Major. When he returns fire, Katana chops his hands off, releasing the atomic energy he harbored. Batman convinces Captain Atom to absorb the energy leaking from Force, which threatened to decimate the city. Captain Atom absorbed all the energy and disappeared, moving several years into the future in a [[quantum leap]]. 

As indicated in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #25, a copy of Major Force's mind, his thoughts, his anger, gets mixed in with the essence of the new Kryptonite Man.

In an issue of ''Guy Gardner'', Major Force seemingly slays Guy's mother in the same manner as Kyle's beloved girlfriend. After some confusion, it is learned Force had killed a neighbor who had been house-sitting. In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' vol. 3, #180 (October, 2004), Force apparently [[Decapitation|decapitates]] Maura Rayner, mother of Kyle Rayner, and stuffed her severed head in an oven. He later said it was just a mannequin. Kyle snaps, decapitated Force (whose head was still talking), sealed it in a bubble of Green Lantern energy and sent it into outer space (Kyle later finds out his mother is alive and well).

==="One Year Later"===
{{main|One Year Later}}
Major Force reappeared in the new ''Battle for [[Blüdhaven]]'' book, a title set a year after the events of [[Infinite Crisis]], as the field leader of project S.H.A.D.E. In issue #5, he rips the right arm off a government hero named [[Major Victory (DC Comics)|Major Victory]], and beats him to death with it. However, Captain Atom was revived by the [[Atomic Knight]]s in issue #6 (as [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]), and Force's rampage was quickly brought to an end when Atom drains him of his energy, leaving nothing but a husk. Force's corpse was last seen falling into the chaos left by Atom's energy expenditure. 

His image appears in the series ''Ion'' as a representation of Kyle Rayner's fear. He has also appeared on the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13 as a member of the latest [[Injustice League]].

==Powers and abilities==
*Major Force is coated with the same alien alloy that covers [[Captain Atom]]. As a result, he also can access the Quantum Field and use its energies for a variety of powers. However, his abilities stemmed from a different spectrum of field granting him different powers from Atom, aside from the superhuman strength and durability. This was theorized to be a result of the Major Force Project using double the amount of alien alloy and detonating a different type of bomb.
*When he debuted, Major Force seemed to control matter much in the way Captain Atom controls energy. Therefore, he could project blasts of dark matter from his hands. He could manipulate this matter into various shapes and quantities. He used this ability to create a hand to replace one that was blown off by explosives implanted under his skin. He did not possess the ability to fly, but rather leapt great distances or traveled on ramps made of dark matter.

==Other versions==
*Major Force had a counterpart on the antimatter universe's Earth named Q-Ranger, a member of the [[Justice Underground]].
