'''Thundra''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superheroine]] who is often aligned with the [[Fantastic Four]]. She is a [[metahuman|powerful]], [[red hair|red-haired]], [[amazons|amazon]]-like warrior, or '''Femizon''', from a [[matriarchy|matriarchal]], technologically advanced future [[alternate future|timeline]] where men have been subjugated by women. She was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and Gerry Conway, and first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #129.

==Fictional character biography==
Thundra is a warrior woman and [[time travel]]ler from the 23rd [[century]]. In the future society she hails from, Planet [[Earth]] is now known as '''Femizonia''', and is ruled by [[amazons|amazon]]-like female [[dominatrix|overlord]]s ([[Femizons]]) who have conquered and enslaved the diminished male population. The former [[United States]] is now the 'United Sisterhood Republic', and Thundra hails from the [[megalopolis]] of 'Milago' (a merged sprawl of [[Milwaukee]] and [[Chicago]]), located in the United Sisterhood's 'Midwestern Republic'. Thundra is renowned as the United Sisterhood's most formidable warrior, having been physically enhanced by [[genetic engineering]], and trained from childhood in combat, the [[martial arts]], and military strategy. 

She is sent to the [[20th century]] to challenge Fantastic Four member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to a bout of one-on-one combat; believing him to be the strongest male of all time. By besting the Thing in combat, she felt she would prove once and for all that women were superior to the male [[gender]], and finally end a stagnant war between Femizonia and the warlike, male dominated planet of Machus, where the female population had been subjugated by its ruler [[Mahkizmo]].

Thundra was also recruited into the evil group of [[supervillains]] known as the [[Frightful Four]] by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]]. She secretly had her own agenda and had no real interest in the group, ultimately switching sides and helping the Fantastic Four defeat them. 

Thundra has [[superhuman]] strength (can lift approximately 60 tons) and endurance, and is a skilled combatant with a sword or  [[chain weapon|chain]], the latter of which is her [[manriki|weapon of choice]], often attached to a [[bracelet]] on her left [[forearm]]. She has battled alongside (and sometimes against) the Fantastic Four and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. At one point, she became a professional [[wrestler]] training with '[[Grapplers (comics)|The Grapplers]]', a group of female wrestlers who possessed [[cybernetic]]-endowed superpowers. In a fixed wrestling match with one Grappler member, Thundra (who had superior strength and fighting skills) was secretly drugged by her opponent, causing her to black out, and lose the match.

When she awoke, it was revealed that the Grapplers were actually agents working for the [[Roxxon Oil Company]], a [[multinational]] [[petroleum]] company which was [[black op|covertly]] involved in developing advanced technology and weaponry for sinister motives. The Grapplers were assigned to trick Thundra into helping them [[sabotage]] Project Pegasus, a prison/research facility built for housing supervillains.

As a result of the deception by Roxxon and the Grapplers, Thundra came to blows (yet again) with the Thing (with whom she has expressed a romantic interest in, on more than one occasion). She was briefly allied with the duplicate [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] while still in service to Roxxon, and later became the consort of the extra-dimensional warlord [[Arkon]].

But Thundra has a special place in her heart for [[Ben Grimm]]/The Thing, and in addition to
her amorous advances, the two have been involved numerous superheroic adventures; 
one particularly significant pairing of the two involved enlisting Grimm to help liberate Femizonia from a powerful, six-armed [[android]] sent from Machus to conquer the Femizons.
After defeating the android, Grimm informed Thundra that they could never be together, expressing his love for [[Alicia Masters]]. Thundra then allowed him to return to the 20th Century.

===Avengers Forever===
Thundra also appears in the Marvel Comics Maxi-Series [[Avengers Forever]]. In the storyline,
she is a member of a rag-tag remnant of Avengers in an [[alternate future]] 
where [[Earth]] has been devastated by evil [[robot]]ic alien invaders from [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]. She still wields a chain as her personal weapon, and she now always goes [[barefoot]] (sans her lost trademark [[buccaneer]] boots). Unlike the other remaining Avengers (most notably the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]), it appears that Thundra has not [[aging|aged]]. Perhaps this is due to the Femizonian [[genetic engineering]] that she was subjected to; the source of her [[metahuman|superhuman]] abilities.

==Powers and abilites==
Thundra possesses superhuman strength, stamina, and endurance. Thundra is trained as a warrior and possesses superior fighting skills along with increased agility and a fair amount of invulnerability.
