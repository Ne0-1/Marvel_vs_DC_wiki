Match was present at Xavier' a special assembly head by the headmaster, [[Charles Xavier]], to inform the sutdent body of an explosion that happened the night before - caused by Magma who'd been awoken from a coma by [[Elixir (comics)|Josh]] and [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Julian's]] invovement -, Xavier preached about heroism being more than being brave.<ref>''New X-Men II''#7</ref> Match would later attend Parent's Week at Xavier's, although it is unknown if his parents for the week he seem to enjoy himself during the festive time.<ref>''New X-Men II''#8</ref> While in class with [[Karma (comics)]] he was asked along with his classmates if they'd seen Josh, who was unknownly out on a date with [[Rahne Sinclair]].<ref>''New X-Men II''#10</ref>

After the exercise, the New Mutants squad tried the same simulation and beat the record set by the Paragons excerise. During a team meeting with Rahne, Ben and his teammates expressed their dismay at the New Mutants squad having had beat their time. Rahne then gave them a much needed peptalk, trying to remind them that they would have save a lot of lives if the session had been real.<ref>''New X-Men II'' #12</ref> Soon after, [[Scott Summers|Cyclops]] and [[Emma Frost]] revealed that Sinclair had been in a romantic relationship with a student, [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]], who was abruptly departed from the school, leaving the Paragons without an advisor. Ultimately, former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]], [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] stepped in to become the Paragons' mentor.<ref>''New X-Men Yearbook Special''#1</ref>

===Post M-Day===
Ben is still viewed as such by his former teammates after the dissolution of the squad system.<ref>''New X-Men II'' #23</ref> Following the events of [[House of M]], only 27 of the school's students retained their powers. All squads were dissolved, and the remaining students were merged into one group.  Ben and his fellow former Paragons [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], and [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]] were revealed to be among the handful of still-powered Xavier students.<ref>''[[X-Men: The 198 Files]]''</ref>

Match, along with several of his fellow students, is sucked down into the realm of [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. When attacked by demons, he quickly joins the fight, killing several demons while trying to protect Pixie and [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]].<ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #39</ref>  Ben participates in the final fight against [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] and is returned to the school after Belasco is defeated.<ref>''New X-Men II'' #37</ref><ref>''New X-Men II'' #38</ref><ref>''New X-Men II'' #39</ref><ref>''New X-Men II'' #40</ref>

===Utopia===
Ben relocates to San Francisco along with the other X-Men.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #2</ref>  He reappears putting out fires started by rioting over Proposition X, an anti-mutant reproductive legislation being pushed by the anti-mutant organization "Humanity Now!"<ref>''Dark X-Men/Dark Avengers: Utopia''</ref> After the riots subside, the [[Dark X-Men]] along with Norman Osborn declare a citywide curfew for all citizens prohibiting public activity after dark. In [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche's]] bar, Match, along with fellow student [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] and other mutants angrily decide to cause a scene after curfew hours for all the world to see as a warning against the "fascism" of the Dark X-Men.  As Match spreads fire throughout [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], the Dark X-Men come to arrest the troublemaking mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> After a battle, they are taken into custody by the Dark X-Men.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #7</ref> Eventually Match and the other imprisoned mutants are freed by the [[X-Force]] and teleported to the island of [[Asteroid M|Utopia]].<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ben's abilities are pyrokinesis, enabling him to produce and manipulate flame. In addition, he is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures.  As a side effect of his powers, Ben's head remains constantly aflame, though it appears that he can control the extent of the flaming; during a Danger Room session, he is able to maintain some level of stealth by lowering the intensity of his head flame.  Ben's body is always glowing, and emits heat, however it is not hot enough to burn his clothing.  The flame on his head is also not as hot as normal fire, and as such, it does not burn what it touches. This was confirmed by his creators, Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir.
