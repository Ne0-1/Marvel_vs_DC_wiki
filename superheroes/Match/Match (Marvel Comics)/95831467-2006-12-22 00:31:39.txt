When his [[List of comic book superpowers#Fire manipulation|Fire manipulation]] powers first manifested, Hammil accidentally set fire to the park in his hometown.  After enrolling at the Institute, Hammil was assigned to the Paragons training squad under the tutelage of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]].  When it was revealed that Sinclair had been in a romantic relationship with a student, [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]], she abruptly departed from the school, leaving the Paragons without an advisor.
