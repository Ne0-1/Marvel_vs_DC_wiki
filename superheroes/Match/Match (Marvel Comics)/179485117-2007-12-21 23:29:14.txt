'''Match''' ('''Ben Hammil'''), a [[fictional character]] in the Marvel Universe.  A [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], Hammil attends the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Paragons Squad===
Ben Hammil is a mutant teenager who attends the Xavier Institute.   After enrolling at the Institute, Hammil was assigned to the Paragons training squad under the tutelage of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]].  When it was revealed that Sinclair had been in a romantic relationship with a student, [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]], she abruptly departed from the school, leaving the Paragons without an advisor.  Ultimately, former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]], [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] stepped in to become the Paragons' mentor.
Though hot-tempered (even voted "Shortest Temper" in the ''New X-Men: Academy X: Yearbook Special''), Hammil is a natural leader, and consequently, was named as the field leader for his squad and is still viewed as such by his former teammates after the dissolution of the squad system.

===Post M-Day===
Following the events of [[House of M]], only 27 of the school's students retained their powers.  All squads were dissolved, and the remaining students were merged into one group.  In ''[[X-Men: The 198 Files]]'', Hammil and his fellow former Paragons [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], and [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]] were revealed to be among the handful of still-powered Xavier students.

===Quest for Magik===
Match, along with several of his fellow students, is sucked down into the realm of [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]]. When attacked by demons, he quickly joins the fight, showing a great amount of control over his powers, killing several demons while trying to protect Pixie and [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]]. <ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #39</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Ben's abilities are [[List of comic book superpowers#Fire manipulation|Pyrokinesis]] , enabling him to produce and manipulate flame. In addition, he is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures.  As a side effect of his powers, Ben's head remains constantly aflame.  Ben's body is always glowing, and emits heat, however it is not hot enough to burn his clothing.  Interestingly, the flame on his head is also not as hot as normal fire, and as such, it does not burn what it touches. This was confirmed by his creators, Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir.
