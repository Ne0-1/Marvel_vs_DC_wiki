==Fictional character biography==
===Paragons Squad===
Ben Hamill is a mutant teenager who attends the Xavier Institute. After enrolling at the Institute, Hamill was assigned to the Paragons training squad under the tutelage of [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]]. When it was revealed that Sinclair had been in a romantic relationship with a student, [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]], she abruptly departed from the school, leaving the Paragons without an advisor. Ultimately, former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]], [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] stepped in to become the Paragons' mentor.{{issue|date=November 2011}}
Though hot-tempered (even voted "Shortest Temper"<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X: Yearbook Special''</ref>), Hamill is a natural leader, and consequently, was named as the field leader for his squad,{{issue|date=November 2011}} and is still viewed as such by his former teammates after the dissolution of the squad system.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Post M-Day===
Following the events of [[House of M]], only 27 of the school's students retained their powers. All squads were dissolved, and the remaining students were merged into one group.  Ben and his fellow former Paragons [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], and [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]] were revealed to be among the handful of still-powered Xavier students.<ref>''[[X-Men: The 198 Files]]''</ref>

===Quest for Magik===
Match, along with several of his fellow students, is sucked down into the realm of [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. When attacked by demons, he quickly joins the fight, killing several demons while trying to protect Pixie and [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]]. <ref>''New X-Men'', vol. 2 #39</ref>  Ben participates in the final fight against [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] and is returned to the school after Belasco is defeated.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

===Utopia===
Ben relocates to San Francisco along with the other X-Men.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #2</ref>  He reappears putting out fires started by rioting over Proposition X, an anti-mutant reproductive legislation being pushed by the anti-mutant organization "Humanity Now!"<ref>''Dark X-Men/Dark Avengers: Utopia''</ref> After the riots subside, the [[Dark X-Men]] along with Norman Osborn declare a city-wide curfew for all citizens prohibiting public activity after dark. In [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche's]] bar, Match, along with fellow student [[Hellion (comics)|Hellion]] and other mutants angrily decide to cause a scene after curfew hours for all the world to see as a warning against the "fascism" of the Dark X-Men.  As Match spreads fire throughout [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], the Dark X-Men come to arrest the troublemaking mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> After a battle, they are taken into custody by the Dark X-Men.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #7</ref> Eventually Match and the other imprisoned mutants are freed by the [[X-Force]] and teleported to the island of [[Asteroid M|Utopia]].<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ben's abilities are [[List of comic book superpowers#Fire manipulation|pyrokinesis]], enabling him to produce and manipulate flame. In addition, he is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures.  As a side effect of his powers, Ben's head remains constantly aflame, though it appears that he can control the extent of the flaming; during a Danger Room session, he is able to maintain some level of stealth by lowering the intensity of his head flame.  Ben's body is always glowing, and emits heat, however it is not hot enough to burn his clothing.  The flame on his head is also not as hot as normal fire, and as such, it does not burn what it touches. This was confirmed by his creators, Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir.
