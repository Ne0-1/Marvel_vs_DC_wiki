'''Bison''' ('''William "Billy" Kitson''') is fictional character from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Billy Kitson''' was a champion basketball player who won a college scholarship and planned to become a professional basketball player, until another player accidentally tripped Billy which resulted in Billy getting a broken leg, ending his dreams and his relationship with his girlfriend Shimari Asbery.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #13</ref>

Billy Kitson had later made contact with the Egyptian God [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]] who turned Billy into the man-bull creature Bison to serve Seth in exchange for his leg being healed.

Seth sent Bison to capture a sample of the Inferno-42 weapon from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] This resulted in Shimari turning to [[Luke Cage]] and [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]] to help Billy. Bison also ran afoul of Seth's other minions [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]] and [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]] whom Bison later teamed up with to fight Luke Cage and Thunderstrike and later turned on his partners. After saving agent [[Alex DePaul]] from his [[Mandroid]] armor, Bison was let go.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #13-14</ref>

Later on, Bison has joined the 7th incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] and was defeated in combat by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. All Bison wanted was to get enough money for his own cure and reunite with Shimari.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-15</ref>

It is revealed in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] series that Bison is one of the inmates left behind in the [[Negative Zone]] 42 prison and was used alongside [[Condor (comics)|Condor]] and [[Gorilla-Man]] II to help [[Star-Lord]] communicate with Mantis telepathically to bring the other Guardians to help defend the 42 prison against [[Blastaar]] and his horde from invading earth via the non-functional portal there.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9-10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bison's transformation has made him incredibly strong. His flesh has been toughened by his transformation. His horns can be used to violently gore an opponent.
