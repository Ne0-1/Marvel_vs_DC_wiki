'''Bison''' ('''William "Billy" Kitson''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Bison first appeared in ''[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]'' #13 (October 1994) and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Ron Frenz]], and [[Al Milgrom]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Billy Kitson''' was a champion [[basketball]] player who won a college scholarship and planned to become a professional basketball player, until another player accidentally tripped him resulting in Billy getting a broken leg. This ended his dreams and his relationship with his girlfriend Shimari Asbery. Billy later made contact with the Egyptian God [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Seth|Seth]] who turned Billy into the man-bull creature Bison to serve Seth in exchange for his leg being healed.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #13</ref> Seth sent Bison to capture a sample of the Inferno-42 weapon from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] This resulted in Shimari turning to [[Luke Cage]] (who was an old neighborhood friend of Billy) and [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]] to help Billy. Bison also ran afoul of Seth's other minions [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]] and [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]], whom Bison later teamed up with to fight Luke Cage and Thunderstrike. However, Billy later turned on his partners, and after saving agent [[Alex DePaul]] from his [[Mandroid]] armor, Bison was let go. Cage and Thunderstrike left the scene with Bison and Shamari back together again.<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #14</ref>

Later on, Bison joined the 7th incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] led by [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]] where they installed numerous weather modulators all around the globe. Bison's motive for joining the Masters of Evil was to get enough money for his own cure and reunite with Shimari. Bison was defeated in combat by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #24-15</ref>

It is revealed in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] series that Bison is one of the inmates left behind in the [[Negative Zone]]'s Prison 42 where he, [[Condor (comics)|Condor]], and [[Gorilla-Man]] are involved in a fight with [[Star-Lord]] who, with the help of [[Jack Flag]], is trying to stop [[Blastaar]] and his horde from invading Earth via the closed portal.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9-10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bison's transformation has made him incredibly strong. His flesh has been toughened by his transformation. His horns can be used to violently gore an opponent.
