'''Jeffrey Garrett''' is fictional [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''X-Treme X-Men #20''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Jeffrey Garrett''' and his siblings were the prisoners of [[Elias Bogan]] at his lodge in [[Alaska]]. When Bogan had Jeffrey’s family killed, the young boy escaped and teleported Bogan’s associates to a glacier, which resulted in them freezing to death.

Wanted for murder, Jeffrey Garrett sought asylum at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] and was looked after by [[Emma Frost]]. Bogan followed Garrett to the school and used him to take him, his schoolmates, Emma Frost, [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] as hostages. Jeffrey managed to save himself and his newfound friends by teleporting them away, [[Gloom (comics)|Gloom]], [[Zach (comics)|Zach]], [[Rubbermaid (comics)|Rubbermaid]], [[Silicon (comics)|Silicon]] and [[Tantra (comics)|Tantra]]. After this incident, Garrett and the other students somehow lost all recollection of the event.

Jeffrey was present when [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] attacked the school after masquerading as the X-Man [[Xorn]]. [[Danielle Moonstar]] tried to get Jeffrey to teleport out of the school, but instead of following orders he returned to his room to retrieve a picture of his deceased family. The school blew up just as Jeffrey began to teleport away, which ultimately killed him but left his spirit behind. Believing Xavier's to not be safe, Jeffrey briefly terrorized the new students at Xavier's in an effort to get them to leave the school. Ultimately Jeffrey's "haunting" was stopped by the [[New Mutants]] and Jeffrey was placed in [[Karma (comics)|Shan]]'s care. Because Jeffrey was technically dead he could never grow up, but he could mature and perhaps one day join a squad. However, after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Jeffrey lost his ghost form powers and now is completely dead.<ref name="newxmen32">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Craig Kyle]] & [[Chris Yost]] | Penciller =  [[Mike Norton]] | Inker = [[Dave Meikis]] | Story = Whatever Happened To Wither? | Title = New X-Men, volume 2 | Issue = 32 | Date = January 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>
