'''"Wolverine: Old Man Logan"''' is an eight-issue storyline from the ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' [[ongoing series]] by writer [[Mark Millar]]  and artist [[Steve McNiven]], published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It began in June 2008, ran through ''Wolverine'' #66-72 and ended in ''Wolverine Giant-Size Old Man Logan'' in September 2009. 

Set over fifty years in the future, it uses a similar premise to another Millar book, ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'', in which the world's supervillains band together to finally destroy all superheroes. The hardcover collected edition was published January 1, 2010.

==Plot==
The United States has been conquered and divided amongst supervillains, with territories belonging to [[Abomination (comics)#Old Man Logan|The Abomination]] (later conquered by the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Old Man Logan|Hulk]]), [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Old Man Logan|Magneto]] (later conquered by a new [[Kingpin (comics)#Old Man Logan|Kingpin]]), [[Alternative versions of Dr. Doom#Old Man Logan|Dr. Doom]] and the [[Red Skull#Old Man Logan|Red Skull]], who has named himself President. Heroes have been wiped out of existence, with the few survivors in hiding. [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Old Man Logan|Logan]] lives with his wife Maureen and young children Scotty and Jade on a barren plot of land in [[Sacramento, California]], now part of the territory known as "Hulkland." Logan, needing money to pay rent to his landlords (the incestuous grandchildren of the Hulk and his first cousin [[She-Hulk#Old Man Logan|She-Hulk]]), accepts a job from a now-blind [[Hawkeye (comics)#Old Man Logan|Hawkeye]] - to help him travel east to the capital of New Babylon, and deliver a secret package (which Logan assumes to be drugs).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Millar, Mark]]|penciller=[[McNiven, Steve]]|inker=[[Vines, Dexter]]| title = [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]| issue = 66| date = 2008

Logan and Hawkeye encounter several diversions on their journey. They rescue Hawkeye's daughter (who seems to be an aspiring hero herself), from the clutches of the new Kingpin, before she murders Kingpin and reveals her intention to seize his territory.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter| title = Wolverine|issue = 68| date = 2008| publisher =Marvel Comics}}</ref> 

They escape a cluster of [[Moloids]], who are destroying cities by sinking them from beneath the surface. They then get chased by a [[Alternative versions of Venom#Old Man Logan|Venom symbiote]]-infused dinosaur (imported from the Savage Land), before being rescued and teleported by the [[Emma Frost#Old Man Logan|White Queen]] and [[Black Bolt#Old Man Logan|Black Bolt]].<ref name="logan71"/>

Throughout the story it is reiterated that the "Wolverine" persona died the day the villains attacked, and Logan has refused to use his claws ever since. Via flashbacks it is revealed that on the night the attack happened, a group of forty supervillains apparently attacked the [[X-Mansion]]. Unable to locate his teammates, Wolverine slaughtered the attackers to ensure the safety of the mutant children. As the last "attacker" was killed, Logan realized that the entire assault was an illusion created by [[Mysterio#Old Man Logan|Mysterio]], and his perceived enemies were actually his fellow [[X-Men]]. This destroyed him emotionally and mentally, and he fled the Mansion in shock. Though he made a subsequent suicide attempt by allowing a freight train to run him over, Logan could not actually kill himself, but had effectively killed  "Wolverine".<ref>{{Cite comic

When they finally reach the capital, Hawkeye delivers his package to an underground resistance group hoping to begin a new Avengers-esque team. The package is revealed to be a case of Super Soldier Serum, enough to form an army. But Hawkeye's clients expose themselves as undercover S.H.I.E.L.D agents. They shoot and kill Logan and Hawkeye.<ref name="logan71">{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title = Wolverine| issue = 71| date = 2009| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> However, Logan's body heals, and he awakens in Red Skull's trophy room amongst the armaments and costumes of the world's fallen superheroes. Without using his claws, he kills Red Skull's men and engages Red Skull himself, eventually decapitating him with [[Captain America's shield#Old Man Logan|Captain America's shield]]. He grabs a briefcase of money (their intended reward for the delivery) and uses pieces of [[Iron Man's armor]] to fly back home.

Upon arriving, Logan discovers that in his absence the Hulk's grandchildren murdered his family, and left the bodies unburied.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title = Wolverine| issue = 72| date = 2009| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> This results in Logan finally unleashing his claws. He seeks out and slaughters the entire Banner clan before encountering old man Banner himself, who displays monstrous strength even in his human form. Banner reveals that while the murder of Logan's family was intended as a message to others, he really just wanted to get Logan angry enough to fight him because he had gotten bored being a "super-villain landlord" like the others. In his Hulk form, Banner is enormous, bigger than the Hulk has ever been shown before, and easily defeats and consumes Logan, but Logan recuperates within Banner's stomach and bursts out, killing him. Afterward, he discovers a baby hulk - Bruce Banner Junior.

A month later, Logan and his neighbors hold a small memorial for Logan's family. Logan then says he plans to defeat all the new world villains and bring peace to the landâ€”with he, and Bruce Banner Junior, being the first members of a new group of superheroes.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title=Giant Size Old Man Logan|date=September 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>
