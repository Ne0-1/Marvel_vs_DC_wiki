'''''Old Man Logan''''' is the title of an eight-issue story arc in ongoing [[comic book]] series ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' published by [[Marvel Comics]] by the writer and artist of the [[2006 in comics|2006]]-[[2007 in comics|2007]] ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', [[Mark Millar]] and [[Steve McNiven]] that debuted with ''Wolverine'' #66 in June [[2008 in comics|2008]]. 

==Premise==
The story is set fifty-plus years in the future, after all superheroes have been defeated. Wolverine, now an old man, has set out on a journey with the now-blind [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] across the barren, villain-ruled remains of the [[United States]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144471 Millar On "Old Man Logan" - Newsarama<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Millar, writer for the story, has said: {{cquote|"It's '''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|Dark Knight]]''' for Wolverine, essentially. The big, wide, show-stopping series that plays around with the most popular Marvel character of the last forty years, a dystopian vision of the Marvel Universe and a unique look at their futures. The heroes have gone, the villains have won and we're two generations away from the Marvel we know."}}

==Synopsis==
{{Verylong section}}
The narration of the story, interposed over shots of a bloody Wolverine crawling from some woodlands to a train-track, begins: 

{{cquote|"No one knows what happened on the night the heroes fell. All we know is that they disappeared and evil triumphed and the bad guys have been calling the shots ever since. What happened to Wolverine is the biggest mystery of them all. Some say they hurt him like no one ever hurt before. Others say he just grew tired of all the fighting and retired to a simpler life. Either way he hasn't raised his voice or popped his claws in fifty years. His old friends would barely recognize him now."}}

50 years later, Logan lives with his wife Maureen, his son Scotty and daughter Jade on a plot of land in Sacramento, California, now part of land known as "Hulkland". He requires money to pay his rent to the landlords of this territory: the descendants of Bruce Banner, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who are a product of years of incestuous procreation. He refuses to sell his children's toys to pay for the rent. Logan is shown as a broken old man, refusing to fight anyone and living peacefully; he realizes that he will be unable to pay the rent, and that the Hulk family will not  accept a plea to pay double next month on its own.

The Hulk gang arrives the next day to confront Logan on his lack of payment, and violently beat him, deriding his inability to fight back despite once having been the most violent of superheroes; though Logan entertains visions of gutting the eldest Hulk brother, he remains calm and takes his beating, to the disappointment of his son, Scott. While healing from the injuries in bed during the night - though very slowly due to his age - and is confronted by a blinded, elderly [[Clint Barton|Hawkeye]]. In order to pay off his rent, Logan accepts a job from Hawkeye: help him navigate across the country and deliver a secret package, possibly illegal.

The next morning Logan says goodbye to his wife and children. They leave in the vehicle once known as the [[Spider-Man's_powers_and_equipment#Spider-Mobile|Spider-mobile]], newly customised by Hawkeye for a long trek. Hawkeye is in the driving seat; despite his being blind, the vehicle is still his, and Logan's purpose along the journey is to help him stick to the right direction.

Turning on the car's [[Satnav]], Logan (and the reader) sees a map of America, now a land dominated entirely by supervillains, who have renamed cities and areas in America for themselves, with names such as [[Absorbing Man|Lair of the Creel Gang]], [[The Lizard (comics)|The Lizard King]], [[Paste Pot Pete|Paste Pot Creek]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Hammer Falls]], [[Norman Osborn|Osborn City]],[[Kingpin (comics)|The Kingdom of the Kingpin]], and [[Doctor Doom|Doom's Lair]]. The route plotted for the two old men goes straight through neo-America.

They pass San Francisco, where [[Mole Man]]'s moloids have devastated the area. A biker gang, calling themselves the "[[Ghost Rider]]s", attack the two partners and try to see what Hawkeye/Clint Barton is carrying in the Spider-Mobile's trunk. Logan takes a beating from the gang, and Hawkeye kills them all. When asked why he didn't defend himself, Logan has a brief [[flashback]] which reveals a massive beating from a being strongly resembling [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]] or [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], [[Omega Red]], and [[Mr. Sinister]]. The pair then travel to  Hammer Falls, formerly [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where people gather to pray for the return of the heroes.
There, an [[Ultron]] robot tells Clint his third wife, who is [[Spider-Man]]'s youngest child, is waiting for him: their child got the idea of assuming the mantle of Spider-Girl and went to confront the Kingpin, where she will soon be executed.

Logan and Hawkeye head for the Kingpin's headquarters to rescue Spider-Girl who attempted to defeat the kingpin with the help of [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] and [[The Punisher (comics)|The Punisher]]. In an arena filled with cheering spectators, the new Kingpin (after stating that he killed [[Magneto]] because he got too old, and took his turf) has the two executed by feeding them to dinosaurs. 

After crashing the Spider-mobile through the side of the building holding Spider Girl, Hawkeye kills all of the guards without the help of Logan. The Kingpin arrives as Hawkeye frees his daughter. But upon being freed, she slays Kingpin and turns on Hawkeye, revealing that she is in fact only interested in ruling over the Kingpin's turf. As Spider-Girl prepares to kill Hawkeye, Logan looks on. Having only accompanied Hawkeye to the end of helping his family out their financial rut and taken a vow of pacifism (refusing to so much as pop his claws for the last several decades) Logan reluctantly prepares to step into the conflict, saying before he does, "Damn you to hell for making me do this, Hawkeye."

Wolverine then proceeds to drive the Spider-Mobile through the site of the brawl, grab Hawkeye, and crash out the side of the building, the two making a break for it.  Spider Girl then orders her new minions after them, and, soon, Logan and Hawkeye are being chased down by at least 50 cars, some with Raptors.  Before they can gain on the two heroes, the Moloids collapse the ground around them, swallowing them into the Earth.

Logan awakes a few hours later, completely underground thousands of feet.  Logan activates a glow-stick, and sees that the Moloids have devoured everyone except Logan and Hawkeye.  He then helps Hawkeye out of an overturned Spider Mobile, then get in, and use the Spider Mobile to drive up the wall underground and out of the chasm.  They then proceed to drive cross-country, back on their route.  On their way, they pass through Paste Pot Creek, [[Wyoming]] (Home to dinosaur imports from the [[Savage Land]]), Electroville (Where a collapsed [[Baxter Building]] lies over the giant skeleton of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]), and through South Dakota, where the [[Red Skull]], the new president of the United States, has his face on [[Mount Rushmore]] (Also home to a hostless Venom symbiote).

They make their way to Iowa, where the two stop at a bar for a drink.  It is here that Wolverine reveals that he's only doing this for the money to pay the rent for his family.  He says he doesn't get excited by death anymore, and doesn't want to go back to the way he was - that he says he's afraid to.  That statement triggers a flashback to Wolverine, costume torn and bloodied, standing over the dead bodies of Omega Red, Mister Sinister, and [[Lady Deathstrike]].  A man then  comes over and is about to joke about the two heroes' "heart-to-heart" when Wolverine tackles him and puts his fist under his jaw, tempting him to make a joke.  He then storms out of the bar, after being stopped by Hawkeye.  Hawkeye, frustrated and curious, begs Logan to tell him what happened to him.  Logan then agrees to tell him his story about what happened to him on the night the heroes fell.
