'''''Wolverine: Old Man Logan''''' is an eight-issue storyline from the ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' [[ongoing series]] by writer [[Mark Millar]]  and artist [[Steve McNiven]], published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It began in June 2008, ran through ''Wolverine'' #66-72 and ended in ''Wolverine Giant-Size Old Man Logan'' in September 2009. Set over fifty years in the future, it features a similar setting to another Millar book, ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'', in which the world's supervillains band together to finally destroy all superheroes, and its premise can be compared to [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''. The hardcover collected edition was published on January 1, 2010.

==Plot==
At the onset of the story, the entire United States has been overtaken and divided amongst supervillains, with territories belonging to [[Abomination (comics)#Old Man Logan|The Abomination]] (later overtaken by the [[Alternate versions of the Hulk#Old Man Logan|Hulk]]), [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Old Man Logan|Magneto]] (later overtaken by a new [[Kingpin (comics)#Old Man Logan|Kingpin]]), [[Alternate versions of Dr. Doom#Old Man_Logan|Dr. Doom]] and the [[Red Skull#Old Man Logan|Red Skull]], who has named himself President. Heroes have been wiped out of existence, with the few survivors in hiding and scattered throughout the country. [[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Old Man Logan|Logan]] lives with his wife Maureen and young children Scotty and Jade on a barren plot of land in Sacramento, California, now part of the territory known as "Hulkland." Logan needs money to pay rent to the landlords of this territory: the hillbilly grandchildren of the Hulk, who are products of years of incestuous procreation originating with Banner and his first cousin [[She-Hulk#Old Man Logan|She-Hulk]]. In order to pay the rent, Logan accepts a job from a now-blind [[Hawkeye (comics)#Old Man Logan|Hawkeye]]: help him navigate east across the country, to the capitol of New Babylon, and deliver a secret, illegal package.

Logan and Hawkeye encounter several diversions on their journey east. They rescue Hawkeye's daughter (who is the granddaughter of [[Alternate versions of Spider-Man#Old Man Logan|Peter Parker]] and appeared to be an aspiring hero herself), from the clutches of the new Kingpin, before she murders Kingpin and reveals her intention to overtake his territory. They escape a cluster of [[Moloids]], who have gone about sinking entire cities from beneath the surface. And they are chased by a [[Alternate versions of Venom#Old Man Logan|Venom symbiote]]-infused dinosaur (imported from the Savage Land) before being rescued and teleported by the [[Emma Frost#Old Man Logan|White Queen]] and [[Black Bolt#Old Man Logan|Black Bolt]], who live in hiding. 

Throughout the story it is said that Logan as "Wolverine" died the day the villains attacked and has refused to pop his claws since, even in a fight. Via flashbacks it is revealed that on the night the world's heroes came under attack by masses of villains, a group consisting of forty supervillains including [[Mr. Sinister]], [[Sabretooth (comics)#Old Man Logan|Sabretooth]], [[Dr. Octopus#Old Man Logan|Dr. Octopus]], [[Omega Red#Old Man Logan|Omega Red]], [[Bullseye (comics)#Old Man Logan|Bullseye]] apparently attacked the [[X-Mansion]]. Unable to locate his teammates, Wolverine was forced to slaughter the attackers to ensure the safety of the mutant children. As the last "attacker" was killed, Logan realized that the entire assault was an illusion created by [[Mysterio#Old Man Logan|Mysterio]], and his perceived enemies were actually his fellow [[X-Men]]. This destroyed him emotionally and mentally, and he wandered from the Mansion never to be heard from again, his last action laying his head across train tracks to be run over. Logan notes that while this couldn't actually destroy him, it in effect killed "Wolverine" for good.

When they finally reach the capitol, Hawkeye delivers his package to an underground resistance group hoping to begin a new Avengers-esque team to fight the villains' oppression. The package is revealed to be a case of Super Soldier Serum, enough to form an army. But Hawkeye's clients reveal themselves to be undercover S.H.I.E.L.D agents, shooting and murdering him and Logan, and they deliver the package and their bodies to the Red Skull. Logan's body heals from the gunshots and he awakens in Skull's trophy room, containing the armaments and costumes of the world's fallen superheroes. Without using his claws, he kills Skull's men and engages the Skull, eventually decapitating him with [[Captain America's shield#Old_Man_Logan|Captain America's Shield]]. He grabs a briefcase of money (their intended reward for the delivery) and uses pieces of [[Iron Man's armor]] to fly back home. 

Upon arriving, Logan discovers that in his absence, Hulk's grandchildren already came and murdered his family.  They apparently did this out of sheer boredom, leaving their bodies as a message to him. This forces Logan to finally unleash his claws once again, seeking out and slaughtering the entire Banner clan, before encountering Banner himself. In his Hulk form, Banner defeats and consumes Logan, but Logan recuperates within Banner's stomach and bursts from within him, killing him. He discovers a baby, Bruce Banner Junior. 

The story was concluded in ''Giant Size Old Man Logan'' (September 2009) with Wolverine slaughtering the Hulk clan in retaliation and killing the Hulk by eviscerating him from the inside after being swallowed before riding off into the sunset with Bruce Banner Junior.

A time-travelling Old Man Logan and Banner Junior then appear (incognito at first) in the pages of Millar's run in the Fantastic Four, collected in the 'World's Greatest' trade paperback.
