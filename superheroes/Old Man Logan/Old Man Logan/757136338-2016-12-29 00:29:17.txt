==Plot==
===Volume One===
The United States has been conquered and divided among supervillains, with territories belonging to [[Abomination (comics)#Old Man Logan|Abomination]] (later conquered by the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Old Man Logan|Hulk]]), [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Old Man Logan|Magneto]] (later conquered by a new [[Kingpin (comics)#Old Man Logan|Kingpin]]), [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Old Man Logan|Doctor Doom]] and the [[Red Skull#Old Man Logan|Red Skull]], who has named himself President. Heroes have been wiped out of existence with the few survivors in hiding. [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Old Man Logan|Logan]] lives with his wife Maureen and young children Scotty and Jade on a barren plot of land in [[Sacramento, California]], now part of the territory known as "Hulkland." Needing money to pay rent to his landlords the Hulk Gang (the incestuous hillbilly grandchildren of the Hulk and his first cousin [[She-Hulk#Old Man Logan|She-Hulk]]), Logan accepts a job from a now-blind [[Hawkeye (comics)#Old Man Logan|Hawkeye]] to help him travel east to the capital of New Babylon and deliver a secret package (which Logan assumes to be drugs).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Millar, Mark]]|penciller=[[McNiven, Steve]]|inker=[[Vines, Dexter]]| title = [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]| issue = 66| date = 2008
| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Logan and Hawkeye encounter several diversions on their journey. They rescue Hawkeye's daughter [[Spider-Girl#Old_Man_Logan|Ashley Barton]] (who seems to be an aspiring Spider-Girl herself) from the clutches of the new Kingpin. They rescue her, but she murders Kingpin and reveals her intention to seize his territory of Hammer Falls (formerly Las Vegas).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter| title = Wolverine|issue = 68| date = 2008| publisher =Marvel Comics}}</ref>

They escape a cluster of [[Moloids]] who are destroying cities by sinking them from beneath the surface. They then get chased by a [[Alternative versions of Venom#Old Man Logan|Venom symbiote]]-infused dinosaur (imported from the Savage Land), before being rescued and teleported by the [[Emma Frost#Old Man Logan|White Queen]] and [[Black Bolt#Old Man Logan|Black Bolt]].<ref name="logan71" />

Throughout the story it is reiterated that the "Wolverine" persona died the day the villains attacked, and Logan has refused to use his claws ever since (though issue #14 of ''Old Man Logan'' (2016) reveals that Logan used his claws once after this event, albeit briefly, to destroy the Silent Order's leadership). Via flashbacks it is revealed that on the night the attack happened, a group of forty supervillains apparently attacked the [[X-Mansion]]. Unable to locate his teammates, Wolverine slaughtered the attackers to ensure the safety of the mutant children. As the last "attacker" [[Bullseye (comics)#Old Man Logan|Bullseye]] was killed, Logan realized that the entire assault was an illusion created by [[Mysterio#Old Man Logan|Mysterio]], and his perceived enemies were actually his fellow [[X-Men]]. This destroyed him emotionally and mentally and he fled the Mansion and wandered away to a train track in shock and shame. Though he made a subsequent suicide attempt by allowing a freight train to run him over, Logan could not actually kill himself, but had effectively killed "Wolverine".<ref>{{Cite comic

When they finally reach the capital, Hawkeye delivers his package to an underground resistance group hoping to begin a new Avengers-esque team. The package is revealed to be a case of Super Soldier Serum enough to form an army. But Hawkeye's clients expose themselves as undercover S.H.I.E.L.D agents. They shoot and kill Logan and Hawkeye.<ref name="logan71">{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title = Wolverine| issue = 71| date = 2009| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

However, Logan's body heals and he awakens in Red Skull's trophy room amongst the armaments and costumes of the world's fallen superheroes. Without using his claws, he kills Red Skull's men and engages Red Skull himself, eventually decapitating him with [[Captain America's shield#Old Man Logan|Captain America's shield]]. He grabs a briefcase of money (their intended reward for the delivery) and uses pieces of [[Iron Man's armor]] to fly back home. Upon arriving, Logan discovers that in his absence the Hulk Gang murdered his family and left the bodies unburied. Abraham Donovan was the one who told him the sad news. This results in Logan finally unleashing his claws.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title = Wolverine| issue = 72| date = 2009| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

He seeks out and slaughters Hulk's grandchildren Beau, Bobbie-Jo, Charlie, Elrod, Eustace, Luke, Otis, Rufus and Woody before encountering old man Banner himself, who displays monstrous strength even in his human form. Banner reveals that while the murder of Logan's family was intended as a message to others, he really just wanted to get Logan angry enough to fight him because he had gotten bored being a "super-villain landlord" like the others. In his Hulk form, Banner is enormous, bigger than the Hulk has ever been shown before, and easily defeats Logan and then consumes him. Logan recuperates within Banner's stomach and bursts out, killing the Hulk. Afterward, he discovers a baby hulk named Bruce Banner Jr. A month later, Logan and his neighbors hold a small memorial for Logan's family. With nothing left on his old home, Logan then says he plans to defeat all the new world villains and bring peace to the land — with him and Bruce Banner Jr. being the first members of a new group of superheroes — before riding off into the sunset.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title=Giant Size Old Man Logan|date=September 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==Sequels==
===''Fantastic Four''===
Written before ''Old Man Logan'' but chronologically taking place afterwards, Millar's run on ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' featured characters who are heavily implied to be the aged Wolverine and a grown up Bruce Banner Jr. from the story.

Their future ravaged by Earth's incoming death, an incarnation of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] led by an older [[Susan Storm]] travels back in time to use cosmic energy to restore their world. Their attempts cause them to clash with the Fantastic Four and [[Doctor Doom]], but they eventually succeed in saving humanity by transporting them to an artificial back-up dimension called NuWorld.

===All-New All-Different Marvel===
Old Man Logan appears in the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event. There will be a solo series starring Old Man Logan.<ref name="Axel-In-Chage"/> Old Man Logan was awake on Earth Prime, he starts to go on a quest to prevent the events that would lead to his future of the near-apocalyptic world. His first target is a D-List villain named Black Butcher who in his future stole Scotty Logan's baseball cap. Logan easily kills him.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> For his next job, Logan used Butcher's workshop to set up his bearings where he hears on the radio that Hulk is in Manhattan. When Logan confronted Hulk, he was lacking the strength of his youth, and failed to defeat a Hulk in his prime. He then learned that the Hulk in question was actually [[Amadeus Cho]] and not Bruce Banner. After evading the police, Logan went to Hawkeye's house in Brooklyn to ask for his help only to find [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]].<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> After explaining who he was, and eventually passing out on Hawkeye's couch, Logan woke up 33 hours later. After learning that Logan was looking for Mysterio, Kate Bishop looked up his last known whereabouts on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database and demanded to come with Logan as he investigated. When they arrived, they found a man named Eddie and his unnamed partner there. Logan immediately attacked them cutting off one man's hand despite them denying that they knew who Mysterio was. A horrified Kate Bishop tried to stop him, but Logan quickly neutralized her as the two men escaped. Logan gave chase, but was stopped by the arrival of Commander Steve Rogers.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #3</ref> After gaining Logan's trust and bringing him to Alberta, Canada, Rogers went on to reassure Logan that this wasn't his past by showing him the adamantium-frozen body of Earth-616's Logan. The sight reminded Logan of the need to enjoy being alive, rather than brooding over his own past ghosts. Although he told Steve Rogers what he had experienced in his timeline, Logan declined Steve's offer to let him help Logan.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>

Old Man Logan appears later in ''[[Extraordinary X-Men]]'' where he decides to remain under the radar, believing his destiny was to kill the X-Men and determined to try anything to avoid it. He also vowed to take out those who would orchestrate the events where the heroes fell and the villains rose.<ref name="Extraordinary X-Men #3">''Extraordinary X-Men'' #3</ref> Logan caught the attention of the X-Men when he was confronted by Cerebra. The X-Men believed Logan to be their late Wolverine.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref> [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] wanted Logan to join their X-Men, but he declined.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #2</ref> The time-displaced Jean Grey [[All-New X-Men|of the past]] convinced Logan to change his mind and vowed to stop him before he arrives at the day when the villains will rise, the heroes will fall, and Wolverine will be tricked into killing the X-Men.<ref name="Extraordinary X-Men #3"/>

After taking a momentary leave, Logan decided to head to the old Weapon X facility where he met Maureen for the first time. Despite managing to finding Maureen, he realized that Maureen is still young and doesn't grow older. The [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] later arrived with [[Lady Deathstrike]] and attempt to hunt down Logan for good.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 3 #5</ref> When Logan was awoken Maureen's mother, Trish that Maureen's dog is missing, Logan agrees to track her dog, and later found the corpse, which was killed by the Reavers. As the Reavers attacked the town, Logan single-handedly killed all the Reavers soldiers, and confronted Yuriko before saving Maureen. After being wounded multiple times, Logan manages to defeat Deathstrike, as she started limping away when Logan blacked out. Thinking that he failed to protect Maureen from the chaos, Logan decided to set-off to find Yuriko.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 3 #7-8</ref>

Logan returns to the X-Heaven, where he had a nightmare where the villains attack at night, which quickly alerted Jean Grey. In order to calm Logan, Jean assists Logan's travels to Manhattan, where in his timeline Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Moon Knight were killed. As Cerebra teleported Logan and Jean to Connecticut (known as Pym Falls), where [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and the rest of the villains kill [[Wonder Man]], before being stepped on by [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]]. When Janet was killed, Hank was devoured by the moloids. Again not assured, Jean & Cerebra teleported Logan to [[Westchester County]], [[New York (state)|New York]] where Logan was tricked into killing the X-Men.<ref>''Wolverine'' (2003) Vol. 3 #70</ref> As Jean manages to assure Logan of no invasion, she takes Logan to [[Madripoor]], where he was greeted by [[Puck (Marvel Comics)|Puck]], Clint, Steve Rogers, and Jubilee. Logan realized that when the invasion comes he doesn't have to faced it alone.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 3 #8</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses Cain]]'s latest vision has him in the Wastelands where he meets Old Man Logan after he saves Ulysses from an unnamed grandchild of Hulk. Ulysses learned that the Inhumans left Earth when Iron Man "pushed her too far."<ref>''Civil War II'' #7</ref>
