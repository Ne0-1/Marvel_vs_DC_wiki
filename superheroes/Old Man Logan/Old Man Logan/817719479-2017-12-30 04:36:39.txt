The series ran through ''Wolverine'' #66–72 and ended in ''Wolverine Giant-Size Old Man Logan'' on September 9th 2009.

Old Man Logan debuted in his solo series during the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline,<ref name= joins>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2078290/old-man-logan-secret-wars-marvel/ |title=Exclusive: Wolverine Joins Marvel's 'Secret Wars' With 'Old Man Logan' |website= [[MTV]].com |date=2015-02-13 |accessdate=2015-11-28}}</ref> written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] with art by Andrea Sorrentino.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original story===
The [[United States]] of Earth-807128 has been conquered and divided among supervillains, with territories belonging to [[Abomination (comics)#Old Man Logan|Abomination]] (later conquered by the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Old Man Logan|Hulk]]), [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Old Man Logan|Magneto]] (later conquered by a new [[Kingpin (comics)#Old Man Logan|Kingpin]]), [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Old Man Logan|Doctor Doom]], and the [[Red Skull#Old Man Logan|Red Skull]], who has named himself President. Superheroes have been wiped out of existence, with the few survivors in hiding. [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Old Man Logan|Logan]] lives with his wife Maureen and young children Scotty and Jade on a barren plot of land in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]], now part of the territory known as Hulkland. Needing money to pay rent to his landlords the Hulk Gang (the [[incest]]uous [[hillbilly]] grandchildren of the Hulk and his first cousin [[She-Hulk#Old Man Logan|She-Hulk]]), Logan accepts a job from a now-blind [[Hawkeye (comics)#Old Man Logan|Hawkeye]] to help him travel east to the capital of New Babylon and deliver a secret package (which Logan assumes to be drugs).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Millar, Mark]]|penciller=[[McNiven, Steve]]|inker=[[Vines, Dexter]]| title = [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]| issue = 66| date = 2008| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Logan and Hawkeye encounter several diversions on their journey. They rescue Hawkeye's daughter [[Spider-Girl#Old Man Logan|Ashley Barton]] (who seems to be an aspiring Spider-Girl) from the clutches of the new Kingpin. She murders Kingpin and reveals her intention to seize his territory of [[Mjolnir (comics)|Hammer]] Falls (formerly [[Las Vegas]]).<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter| title = Wolverine|issue = 68| date = 2008| publisher =Marvel Comics}}</ref>

They escape a cluster of [[Moloids]] who are destroying cities by sinking them from beneath the surface. They then get chased by a [[Alternative versions of Venom#Old Man Logan|Venom symbiote]]-infused dinosaur (imported from the [[Savage Land]]), but they are rescued and teleported by the [[Emma Frost#Old Man Logan|White Queen]] and [[Black Bolt#Old Man Logan|Black Bolt]].<ref name= logan71 />

Throughout the story it is reiterated that the "Wolverine" persona died the day the villains attacked and that since then, Logan has refused to use his claws. (However, in ''Old Man Logan'' #14 (2016) Logan used his claws once after this event, albeit briefly, to destroy the Silent Order's leadership). [[flashback (continuity)|Flashbacks]] reveal that on the night the attack happened, a group of 40 supervillains attacked the [[X-Mansion]]. Unable to locate his teammates, Wolverine slaughtered the attackers to ensure the safety of the mutant children. As the last "attacker" Bullseye was killed, Logan realized that the entire assault was an illusion created by [[Mysterio#Old Man Logan|Mysterio]] and his perceived enemies were actually his fellow [[X-Men]]. This destroyed Wolverine emotionally and mentally, and he fled the mansion and wandered away to a train track in shock and shame. Though he made a subsequent suicide attempt by allowing a freight train to run him over, Logan could not actually kill himself, but had effectively killed "Wolverine".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer= Millar, Mark| penciller= McNiven, Steve| inker= Vines, Dexter| title =Wolverine|issue = 70| date = 2009| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

[[File:4.25.13MarkMillarByLuigiNovi55.jpg|thumb|Writer [[Mark Millar]] signing a copy of the collected edition during an appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan]]
When they arrive at the capital, Hawkeye delivers his package to an [[resistance movement|underground resistance]] group hoping to begin a new team like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The package contains [[Super Soldier Serum]], enough to form an army, but Hawkeye's clients expose themselves as undercover [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. They shoot and kill Logan and Hawkeye.<ref name= logan71>{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title = Wolverine| issue = 71| date = 2009| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Logan's body heals, and he awakens in Red Skull's trophy room amongst the armaments and costumes of fallen superheroes. Without using his claws, he kills Red Skull's men and engages Red Skull himself, eventually decapitating him with [[Captain America's shield#Old Man Logan|Captain America's shield]]. He grabs a briefcase of money (their intended reward for the delivery) and uses pieces of [[Iron Man's armor]] to fly back home.

Upon arriving, Logan discovers that in his absence the Hulk Gang murdered his family and left the bodies unburied. This results in Logan finally unleashing his claws.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve |inker= Vines, Dexter|title = Wolverine| issue = 72| date = 2009| publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> He seeks out and slaughters Hulk's grandchildren Beau, Bobbie-Jo, Charlie, Elrod, Eustace, Luke, Otis, Rufus and Woody before encountering old man Banner himself, who displays monstrous strength even in his human form. It is implied that the gamma poisoning in his body had begun to deteriorate his sanity in his old age. Banner reveals that while the murder of Logan's family was intended as a message to others, he really just wanted to get Logan angry enough to fight him because he had gotten bored being a "super-villain landlord" like the others. In his Hulk form, Banner is enormous, bigger than the Hulk has ever been shown before,{{original research inline|date=March 2017}} and easily defeats Logan and then consumes him. Logan recuperates within Banner's stomach and bursts out, killing the Hulk. Afterward, he discovers a baby Hulk named Bruce Banner, Jr. A month later, Logan and his neighbors hold a small memorial for Logan's family. With nothing left of his old home, Logan then says he plans to defeat all the new world villains and bring peace to the land—with himself and Bruce Banner, Jr. being the first members of a new group of superheroes—before riding off into the sunset.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Millar, Mark|penciller=McNiven, Steve|inker=Vines, Dexter|title=Giant Size Old Man Logan|date=September 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

===''Secret Wars'' (2015)===
When the Multiverse was destroyed and [[Battleworld]] was created, a different version from another universe of "Old Man Logan" is reborn on the Battleworld domain called the Wastelands, a re-creation of his native reality with his memories still intact, although he does not know how he arrived in Battleworld. After having declared to set his world right, Logan disrupts a [[poker]] game between the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]] and his Flying Devils, and he ends their [[human trafficking]] ring by killing them, freeing those imprisoned. While on the way back to meet with [[Danielle Cage]], Logan witnesses the head of an [[Ultron|Ultron Sentinel]] fall from above. Wishing to investigate further, he brings it along with him back home, where Bruce Jr. and Danielle also reside. After explaining this new development, he investigates the head's origins. He visits Hammer Falls and meets with the dying Emma Frost, and he learns that the head is from beyond the Wastelands, so he begins traveling beyond his domain.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #1</ref>

When Logan trespasses upon its borders, he is approached by an unidentified [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] of the Thor Corps. She attacks Logan with a lightning bolt for breaking [[Doctor Doom]]'s laws, falling into the [[Age of Apocalypse|Domain of Apocalypse]] in the process. Already healed from the burns caused by the Thor's attack, Logan is attacked by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Creed]] (who is one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]]) and his soldiers, but Logan is rescued by the X-Men and taken to their hideout, where they are attacked by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and his other Horsemen.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #2</ref>

The battle that ensues is intervened by the Thor who attacked Logan earlier, and as she argues with Apocalypse, Logan flees and hides. The Thor then demands to know to where he had run, but no one answers. Angry, she attacks both the X-Men and the Horsemen with a lightning bolt and then looks for Logan through the domain. When she is near the domain's walls, Logan climbs it and attacks her from behind. Enraged, the Thor attacks him with another lightning bolt and lets him fall into the neighboring domain of Technopolis, as she is attacked by Apocalypse's Infinite Soldiers. Logan is taken to Stark Tower by [[Iron Man|Baron Stark]] and [[War Machine|Grand Marshal Rhodes]], the Thor of that domain. After healing from his injuries, Logan awakens only to find himself in a totally different domain from the one where he was. He ends up fighting Rhodes but is defeated and sent to the Deadlands as punishment for breaking Doom's laws.<ref>Old Man Logan'' #3</ref>

Due to his healing factor, Logan succeeds in fighting through hordes of zombies in the Deadlands. He takes shelter inside a cave where he finds an uninfected [[She-Hulk]] who has been there for a long time. He tries to convince her to throw him out of the Deadlands when the zombies find them. In a desperate attempt to save Logan's life, She-Hulk grabs him and jumps as high as she can to throw him out of the Deadlands as he had suggested, ultimately sacrificing her own life to do so. Afterwards, Logan finds himself in the Battleworld domain called the Kingdom of Manhattan.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 1 #4</ref>

While wandering the city he has not seen in years, Logan meets this domain's [[Jean Grey]] and Emma Frost. They take him to meet the rest of the X-Men, as well as "his" son [[Jimmy Hudson]]. Logan later leads the superhero population of the Kingdom of Manhattan in a rebellion against God Emperor Doom. Subsequently, Logan finds himself in a new world.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #5</ref>

===All-New All-Different Marvel===
Logan awakens on [[Earth-616]] in [[New York City]]. He is not sure how he has been relocated, but he knows he is in the past. He decides to prevent his post-apocalyptic future. His first target is a minor villain Black Butcher who in his future stole Scotty Logan's baseball cap. Logan easily kills him.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #1"</ref>

Logan uses Black Butcher's workshop to prepare. He hears on the radio that the [[Amadeus Cho|Hulk]] is in [[Manhattan]]. Logan confronts Hulk and after a brief fight, learns that the Hulk in question is actually [[Amadeus Cho]] and not Bruce Banner. After evading the police, Logan goes to Hawkeye's apartment in [[Brooklyn]] to ask for his help, but he finds [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]].<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

He explains his situation and drops exhausted on Hawkeye's couch, awakening 33 hours later. Knowing that Logan is seeking [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]], Kate accesses the villain's last known whereabouts on [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s database. She demands to join Logan on his search. When they arrive, they find a man Eddie and his unnamed partner there. Logan immediately attacks them, cutting off one man's hand despite them denying that they knew who Mysterio is. A horrified Kate tries to stop him, but Logan quickly neutralizes her as the two men escape. Logan chases them, but he is stopped by the arrival of [[Captain America|Commander Steve Rogers]].<ref>''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #3</ref>

After gaining Logan's trust and bringing him to [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], Rogers reassures Logan that this is not his past by showing him the [[adamantium]]-coated corpse of his younger self. The sight reminds Logan to enjoy life, rather than brood over his own past ghosts. Although he tells Rogers what he had experienced in his timeline, Logan declines Rogers' offer of help.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #4"</ref>

Logan later appears in ''[[Extraordinary X-Men]]'' where he decides to remain under the radar, believing his destiny was to kill the X-Men and determined to try anything to avoid it. He also vows to take out those who would orchestrate the villain uprising.<ref name="Extr X-Men #3">''Extraordinary X-Men'' #3</ref> Logan catches the X-Men's attention when confronted by Cerebra. The X-Men believe Logan to be their late Wolverine.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref> [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] wants Logan to rejoin the team, but he declines.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #2</ref> The time-displaced Jean Grey [[All-New X-Men|of the past]] convinces Logan to change his mind and promises to stop him from killing the X-Men again.<ref name="Extr X-Men #3"/>

After taking a momentary leave, Logan decides to head to the old Weapon X facility where he initially met Maureen. He finds her, but she is still a child. The [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] arrive at Killhorn Falls with Lady Deathstrike and attempt to hunt down Logan.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 3 #5</ref> When Logan searches for Maureen's missing dog, he discovers its corpse which was killed by the Reavers. As the Reavers massacre the town, Logan singlehandedly kills them all and confronts Lady Deathstrike before saving Maureen. He is wounded multiple times, but Logan defeats Deathstrike. As she leaves, limping, Logan falls unconscious. Realizing that he failed to protect Maureen from the chaos, Logan decides to hunt down Lady Deathstrike.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #7–8</ref>

Logan returns to X-Haven where he has a nightmare about the villain uprising which quickly alerts Jean. In order to calm Logan, Jean assists Logan's travels to Manhattan where in his timeline, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[Moon Knight]] had been killed by [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. While [[Punisher]] managed to kill Electro, he was stabbed by [[Kraven the Hunter]]. As [[Cerebra]] teleports Logan and Jean to [[Connecticut]] where Pym Falls would be established in Logan's timeline. It is here where [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and the rest of the villains with him killed [[Wonder Man]] before Crossbones was stepped on by [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]] who also crushes [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] with his hand. When [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] was killed after shooting down [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]], Giant-Man was devoured by the Moloids that emerged from the ground when [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] shook the area around Giant-Man. Again not assured, Jean and Cerebra teleport Logan to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[New York (state)|New York]] where Logan was tricked by Mysterio into killing the X-Men. As Jean manages to assure Logan of no invasion, she takes Logan to [[Madripoor]] where he is greeted by [[Puck (Marvel Comics)|Puck]], Hawkeye, Steve Rogers, and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. Logan realizes that if and when the villain uprising comes, he will not need to face it alone.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #8</ref>

Logan goes to a bar in [[Tokyo]] as Patch, where he meets Eito, a minor crimelord. Logan attempts to bribe him for information on Lady Deathstrike's whereabouts, but the meeting turns out to be a ruse. He is gunned down by Eito's henchmen, but he heals and then slaughters them all. Before he kills Eito, Logan interrogates him and learns that Lady Deathstrike is in a remote village. Logan travels there, noting that it is where he and Maureen had attempted to find refuge in his past. The village is seemingly abandoned, but he finds Yuriko chained to a wall, begging for his help. He is then ambushed by a [[ninja]] clan, the Silent Order. Four days later, he awakens in a well and attempts to climb out, but he is shot down by Sohei, the Order's leader. Once Logan succeeds in climbing out of the well, he sees he is in a temple and Lady Deathstrike is in a cage. He is attacked by Sohei and the rest of the Silent Order. Logan is overwhelmed by the horde of ninjas, so he has no choice but to free Lady Deathstrike. After Logan and Yuriko manage to kill all of the ninjas, she attempts to kill Sohei but is cut down by him, causing her to stumble back into the well. Just as Logan attempts to confront Sohei, he is [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] assaulted by his unwitting enforcer, a mutant child called the Silent Monk, whose older self Logan had killed in his timeline. The Monk has had a vision of his death and tries to kill Logan by throwing him into the well over and over again. Lady Deathstrike throws an arrow into the Silent Monk's thigh, causing him to fall in. Logan then threatens to kill the young mutant unless Sohei releases he and Yuriko. Sohei calls Logan's bluff, but knows that Yuriko is more than willing to murder a helpless child. Sohei agrees to their demands just as the Silent Monk regains consciousness and lashes out. The Monk transforms into a giant creature as his powers run wild. Logan convinces the young boy to [[Telepathy|read his mind]], assuring the Monk that Logan's future will never likely come true. The young boy then realizes that Sohei has been manipulating him and subdues Sohei and the remaining Silent Order ninjas. Logan offers to take the Silent Monk to X-Haven to which he accepts.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #9–14</ref>

One day at X-Haven, Logan is approached by Cerebra who informs him of Jubilee's disappearance. Logan begins his search by going to Jubilee's apartment, only to find her infant son Shogo by himself. Logan leaves the baby in Cerebra's care before telling her to teleport him to wherever Jubilee was last located, which is Romania. Soon after arriving, Logan encounters the [[Howling Commandos]] who mistake him for a vampire and attack him. After the misunderstanding is cleared, their leader [[Warwolf (Marvel Comics)|Warwolf]] informs Logan of their war with [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Dracula has been psychically calling all vampires to his castle, which Logan deduces must include Jubilee. The Commandos attack Dracula's castle while Logan sneaks in but are subdued by his army, led by [[Vampire by Night]], who is under Dracula's control. Logan finds Jubilee who, also under Dracula's control, begs him to save her. Just as he lets his guard down, Dracula attacks Logan from behind, biting him. Logan fights Dracula as his healing factor fights off the vampirism. The Vampire King easily beats the weakened Logan, who then passes out. Logan wakes up in the dungeon, along with the Howling Cammandos. As Dracula taunts them, Jubilee begins resisting his control. Logan encourages her to fight back just before [[Man-Thing]] and [[Orrgo]] break in to free everyone. Dracula threatens to kill Jubilee as Logan approaches him. Now free from his control, Jubilee throws Dracula towards Logan, who then impales him. After a brief scuffle, Orrgo grabs Dracula and exposes him to the sun. Logan then proceeds to decapitate Dracula, freeing his thralls. Logan instructs Cerebra to throw Dracula's head into the sun in order to prevent or at the very least, delay his resurrection. Later, Logan spends time with Jubilee and Shogo over dinner.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #14–15</ref>

Logan awakens in a desert, his memory hazy. Logan realizes that he's somehow back in the Wastelands as he is attacked by the Venom T-Rex. After killing the beast, Logan retraces his steps and remembers receiving a distress call from Puck, who he and the rest of [[Alpha Flight]] were trapped in an abandoned space station formerly owned by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]. After going into space and entering said space station via X-Shuttle, Logan found it infested with the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]. He managed to kill the Brood drones that attacked him and proceeded to look for Alpha Flight only to find most of them encased in cocoons. Logan was then attacked by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and [[Abigail Brand]], who had been converted into Brood drones. He was saved by Puck at the last minute and the two escaped through an air vent. After finding a safe place to regroup, the hull was ripped open, causing Logan to be pulled into space. Logan regained consciousness aboard the Alpha Flight Squadron Jet, piloted by Puck, who had saved him. The two then snuck back onto the station. Logan and Puck were discovered by the Brood, forcing them to fight. The Brood then inexplicably disappeared. Logan goes back to his old house looking for Dani Cage and Bruce Banner Jr. only to find it seemingly abandoned. Logan then hears a noise and finds Dani bound and gagged in the closet. She tells him that Bruce has been kidnapped by [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Logan then sets out to hunt down Kang down and rescue the baby. Logan's search leads him to [[Niagara Falls]], where he is assaulted by some thugs and kicked down a cliff. Logan regains consciousness and soon encounters a hysterical Puck, surrounded by the corpses of Alpha Flight. Puck warns Logan about the "Warlord of the Wastelands" just before Kang reveals himself. Kang claims to have taken the baby in order to prevent the Warlord's rise to power, confusing Logan. They are confronted by the Warlord, who is revealed to be a fully grown Bruce Banner Jr. As the Warlord beats Logan, Puck urges him to remember what has happened. It is revealed that the X-Men came to help, but were converted by the Brood and that Logan's experiences in the Wastelands were an illusion created by Jean Grey. Jean telepathically assaults Logan by forcing him to relive his greatest crimes and failures. He resists the attack and kills the parasite controlling Jean. Jean shuts down the Brood hive mind, freeing everyone from its control. In the aftermath, Logan resolves to go back to the Wastelands to save baby Bruce.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #16–18</ref>

Logan seeks help from the foremost experts on [[time travel]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], including [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]], Doctor Doom, [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and [[Doctor Strange]], who all refuse to help him due to how his plan might affect the timestream. Desperate and left with no options, Logan breaks into the Cellar: a maximum-security super-prison. After subduing the guards, Logan is confronted by [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]], whom he distracts by freeing some of the inmates. Logan then enters the cell of [[Asmodeus (Marvel Comics)|Asmodeus]], a servant of [[Satannish]] and makes him an offer.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #19</ref> Asmodeus states to Logan that he would help him in his mission if he picked up some of his things. Afterwards, Asmodeus begins to help Logan in his mission to rescue Bruce Banner Jr.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' vol. 2 #20</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses Cain]]'s latest vision has him in the Wastelands where he meets Logan after he saves Ulysses from a Hulk. Ulysses learns that the Inhumans left Earth when Tony Stark "pushed [[Carol Danvers|her]] too far".<ref>''Civil War II'' #7</ref>

During the ''[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, [[Inferno (Dante Pertuz)|Inferno]] and Iso escape through [[List of Marvel Comics characters: E#Eldrac|Eldrac]] to get away from [[X-23|Wolverine (X-23)]] only to end up running into Logan.<ref>''IVX'' #2</ref> While Inferno distracts Logan, Iso discovers Forge nearby with a device that the X-Men are planning to use to destroy the Terrigen Cloud. Iso and Inferno manage to defeat Logan and Forge then flee as they take Forge prisoner.<ref>''IVX'' #3</ref>

During the ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' storyline, Logan is seen fighting Leviathons in Louisiana and receives help from [[List of monsters in Marvel Comics#Monstrom|Monstrom]].<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

During the ''[[RessurXion]]'' event, Logan is seen as a member of [[Kitty Pryde]]'s new Gold Team of X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #1</ref>

While spending some alone time in the woods as part of the "Weapons of Mutant Destruction" storyline, Logan is attacked by [[Weapon X]] cyborgs, forcing him to team up with [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] to confront the current iteration of the organization, whose goal is to hunt mutantkind to extinction.<ref>''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #1</ref>

Recently, Old Man Logan, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth were captured by a group of anti-mutant terrorists called The Orphans Of X and were all killed, having all their heads blown off by bullets covered in Muramasa metal and their healing factors nullified permanently.<ref> ''All New Wolverine'' Vol. 1 #28</ref>

==Other versions==
===''Fantastic Four''===
Old Man Logan and Bruce Banner Jr. are briefly featured during a scene when the new [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] led by an older [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] travels back in time to use cosmic energy to restore their world.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #558 (August, 2008)</ref>

===''Venomverse''===
In the ''Venomverse'' crossover, this version of Logan raises Bruce Jr. for 15 years before telling him of his true parentage. Bruce Jr. leaves his adoptive father in anger as Logan is eventually found by Archangel.

==In other media==
===Film===
* Elements of ''Old Man Logan'' were incorporated into the 2013 film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''. Much like the aftermath of Wolverine killing the X-Men in the original story, Logan is consumed with guilt and depression following [[X-Men: The Last Stand|the death of Jean Grey]] and has apparently refrained from popping his claws for several years at the start of the film.
* ''Old Man Logan'' was an inspiration for the 2017 film ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'', the character's final appearance in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and [[Hugh Jackman]]'s ninth and final on-screen portrayal of the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/09/25/mark-millar-explains-how-a-wolverine-old-man-logan-movie-could-work-without-marvel-studios-characters|title=Mark Millar Explains How a Wolverine: Old Man Logan Movie Could Work Without Marvel Studios Characters |last= Yehl |first=Joshua|work=[[IGN]]|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref> While featuring an original premise, the film likewise features an aging Logan in a bleak alternate future after the deaths of his fellow X-Men (their deaths in this series implied to be due to Professor X suffering a psychic seizure due to old age) where he suffers a degrading healing factor.
