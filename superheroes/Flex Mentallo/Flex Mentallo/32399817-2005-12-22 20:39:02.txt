'''Flex Mentallo''' first appeared in 1990 in issue #35 of [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on [[Doom Patrol]], as a member of the audience for Danny the Street's Perpetual Cabaret. Later in the storyline, Flex realises that he is actually "The Man of Muscle Mystery", and tidies his appearance. Flex is revealed to be not an entirely original creation, but rather a riff on the post-workout protagonist of [[Charles Atlas]]' long-running "The Insult that made a Man out of Mac" advertisment from American comics.

In 1996, Flex Mentallo received his own four-issue mini-series written by Morrison and illustrated by [[Frank Quitely]]. Although ignored by the Charles Atlas company at the time, it was later brought to the company's attention by a fan of the comics. The Charles Atlas company was unhappy with its likeness being used this way, and threatened DC with a lawsuit. DC won the subsequent case, but the verdict dictated that DC must pay the Charles Atlas company royalties for any reprint collection. DC has so far declined to reprint the mini-series - although his initial appearances are included in DC's third collection of the Morrison [[Doom Patrol]] stories, 'Down Paradise Way'.
