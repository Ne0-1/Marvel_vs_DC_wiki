'''The Whip''' is the alias used by at least four superheroes in [[DC Comics]]. The third one, although both better known and obscure at the same time, made his first appearance in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1. The most recent version appeared in 2005 and was created by [[Grant Morrison]].

The first and third Whip have been considered as [[Zorro]] wannabees.

==Fernando Suarez (El Castigo)==
The first Whip was '''Don Fernando Suarez'''. In 1840s Mexico, Fernando was the protector of the poor in a small Mexican town. His name was '''El Castigo''', which was translated from Spanish as The Whip.

==Johnny Lash==
The second Whip had no relation to Don Fernando. His name was '''Johnny Lash''', and he appeared in ''Crack Western'' #70, published by [[Quality Comics]].

==Rodney Gaynor==
On a trip to the United States, '''Rodrigo "Rodney" Elwood Gaynor''' (a descendant of Don Fernando Suarez, the original Whip) was deeply disturbed at the treatment of the poor citizens of a small Mexican town. Once Rodney discovered his ancestor's alter-ego of the Whip, he revived the logo and began to fight the evil land barons who so mercilessly taxed the poor. Rodney would sometimes meet with [[Vigilante (comics)|The Vigilante (Greg Saunders)]] and became a member of the [[All-Star Squadron]].

==Shelly Gaynor==
'''Shelly Gaynor''', granddaughter of Rod Gaynor, worked as a columnist for the Daily Recorder, a well-known newspaper. Shelly decided to do an in-depth study on what it was like to be a superhero, or as she called a '''Super Cowboy'''. Her first book on superheroics was called "''Body Thunder: How I Turned My Body Into A Living Weapon To Beat The 21st Century Blues''". Just like her grandfather before her, she decided to revive the Whip logo.

Her first appearance in comic books was ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory|Seven Soldiers]]'' #0, where she became a part of an ill-fated team of six superheroes rounded up by Greg Saunders. Shelly slept with her teammate [[Alias the Spider|I, Spyder]], and was killed along with the rest of the team by the [[Sheeda]], an evil race of beings who hunt down civilizations but always leave enough survivors  for the race to continue.
