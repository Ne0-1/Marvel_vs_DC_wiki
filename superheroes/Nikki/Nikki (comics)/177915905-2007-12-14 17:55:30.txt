'''Nicholette "Nikki" Gold''' is a fictional character, a woman in the [[Earth-691]] timeline of the fictional [[Marvel Universe]], genetically engineered to live on the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].  As such, she has a superhuman ability to withstand heat and ultraviolet radiation, and can see clearly in very bright light. She is bald, although she expels body heat through her head in a low-temperature flame resembling hair in shape.  She was the sixth member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], and is noted for her acrobatic and sharp-shooting skill.  She first appeared in ''[[Marvel Presents]]'' #4, and was created by [[Steve Gerber]] (who did not call her Nicholette Gold).

During her time on the team, Nikki had a romantic relationship with [[Charlie-27]], though they later amicably separated. She became attracted to newcomer [[Talon (Marvel Comics)|Talon]] though he simply wished to remain friends.
