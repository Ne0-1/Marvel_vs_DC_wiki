The '''Western Kid''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Old West]] character in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]], and the star of [[Western fiction|Western]] feature published by Marvel's 1950s precursor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].

==Publication history==
Tex Dawson, the Western Kid, debuted in [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]' ''Western Kid'' #1 (Nov. 1954), created by an unknown writer and [[penciler]]-[[inker]] [[John Romita Sr.]], who the following decade would become one of [[Spider-Man]]'s signature artists. The feature, drawn exclusively by Romita, ran through issue #17 (Aug. 1957), with cover art by Romita, [[Joe Maneely]], [[John Severin]], and, for one cover each, [[Carl Burgos]], [[Russ Heath]], and [[Syd Shores]].

The character resurfaced as the lead feature of the omnibus title ''Gunsmoke Western'' #51 (March 1959), in a story written by Atlas/Marvel editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] and drawn by [[Dick Ayers]].

Western Kid reprints appeared in Marvel's 1970s omnibus series ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #3-6 and 17-33 ((Dec.1970 - Sept. 1971, Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1975). In-between, the character starred in the reprint series ''The Western Kid'' vol. 2, #1-5 (Dec. 1971 - Aug. 1972) &mdash; the first issue of which sported a new cover by original artist Romita &mdash; and in ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'' #105 (Nov. 1972) and ''Gun-Slinger'' #1-3 (Jan.-June 1973), a series reflecting the character's temporary new name. The first issue, with a cover drawn by industry legend [[Jim Steranko]], was titled ''Tex Dawson, Gun-Slinger''.
<!--
The character returned in ''[[Apache Skies]]'' (2002), a four-issue [[miniseries]] starring the [[Rawhide Kid]] and two persons called the Apache Kid: Dazii Aloysius Kare, and his wife, Rosa. This  was a sequel to the miniseries ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' (2000), which specifically [[retconned]] that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely [[dime novel]] fictions of the characters' actual lives.-->

==Fictional character biography==
Tex Dawson, a.k.a. the Western Kid, was a clean-cut [[Old West]] [[cowboy]] with a [[stallion]] named Whirlwind and a white [[German shepherd]] dog named Lightning. Unlike such fellow Atlas Western stars as [[Kid Colt]] and the [[Rawhide Kid]], he was not hunted by the law for a perceived crime, and unlike the [[Two-Gun Kid]] or the [[Outlaw Kid]], he wore no mask. Wandering the range as a do-gooder adventurer, the Western Kid was respected by [[sheriff]]s and [[marshal]]s, whom he often helped, and idolized by children.
