'''Le Peregrine''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  Alain Racine is a superhero from France, who took his name after the French word for "the falcon".  

Peregrine was first seen in the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]]'s [[Contest of Champions]] against [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] for the life of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]].  He competed on the Grandmaster's side, in the illustrious company of other heroes such as [[Captain America]], [[Captain Britain]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]], [[She-Hulk]], and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].  He was pitted against another winged opponent, the [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]], but the Angel's greater experience gave him the edge to defeat Le Peregrine.

Later, back on Earth, Peregrine encountered [[Silver Sable]], who invited him to become her operative in France. He assisted the archer [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in destroying a nuclear warhead generator stolen by the [[Red Skull]], and freeing the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]--another of Silver Sable's operatives--in the process.
