'''Le Peregrine''' ('''Alain Racine''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  

==Fictional character biography==
Alain Racine was born in [[Moulins]], France.  He is a superhero, using a falcon-like costume with artificial wings giving him the ability to fly.  

Peregrine was first seen in the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]]'s [[Contest of Champions]] against [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] for the life of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]].  He competed on the Grandmaster's side, in the illustrious company of other heroes such as [[Captain America]], [[Captain Britain]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]], [[She-Hulk]], and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].  He was pitted against another winged opponent, the [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]], but the Angel's greater experience gave him the edge to defeat Le Peregrine.

Later, back on Earth, Peregrine encountered [[Silver Sable]], who invited him to become her freelance operative in France. He assisted the archer [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] in destroying a nuclear warhead generator stolen by the [[Red Skull]], and freeing the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]--another of Silver Sable's operatives &mdash; in the process.

During the [[Civil War (comics)|superhero Civil War]], Peregrine was protecting France's borders from refugee U.S. superhumans fleeing the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Battle Damage Report]]''</ref>

==Name==
It should be noted that the word "peregrine" does not exist in French, making the name "Le Peregrine" quite odd to a French reader; in French translations of comics starring the character, his name was changed to "''Le Faucon Pèlerin''", meaning "The [[Peregrine Falcon]]". ''Faucon-pérégrin'' does exists as the bird's alternate name, but is less frequently used.
