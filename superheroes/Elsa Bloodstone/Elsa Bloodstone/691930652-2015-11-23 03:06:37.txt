'''Elsa Bloodstone''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appears in Marvel's ''Bloodstone'' [[limited series|mini-series]] of [[2001 in comics|2001]] written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]. She is the daughter of the previously established [[Marvel Universe]] character [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] and the sister of [[Cullen Bloodstone]].

As she is a young, female monster-hunter there are potential similarities with [[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]], although when asked about this the authors said "neither of us have seen an episode of ''Buffy'' all the way through! I know we're missing out on some great TV but we've determined to steer clear of Buffy at least while we're doing Bloodstone."<ref>[http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/dec01/abnett_lanning.shtml New DnA], Sequential Tart, December 2001</ref>

==Publication history==
Elsa appeared as the lead character in the ''Bloodstone'' mini-series and has been mentioned in the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].

In August 2013, Elsa joined a team of Super heroines known as the [[Fearless Defenders]]. At the time of her joining, the roster consisted of [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Misty Knight]], Annabelle Riggs, [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Warrior Woman]], [[Danielle Moonstar]] and [[Clea]].

Other versions of her have appeared in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' and as a team member in the ''[[Nextwave]]'' series.

===Nextwave===
{{Main|Nextwave}}

Elsa Bloodstone has also appeared in ''[[Nextwave]]'', but the series' connection to the Marvel Universe is unclear - it was initially out-of-continuity<ref>Jennifer M. Contino (2005-12-08). "[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004516 Ellis Talks Nextwave & Ultimate Extinction]", [[Comic-Con International]]</ref><ref>Wade Gum (2006-07-01). "[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm Heros Con: Joe Quesada Panel]", ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''</ref> and was later implied to be the adventures of tourists from [[Earth-A]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #21 (2007)</ref><ref>For further details on this see [[Nextwave#Continuity]]</ref> However ''[[Civil War: Damage Report]]'' suggest that at least parts of the adventures of the team were set in the main continuity: the others may have been delusions brought by constant use of drugs, mental conditioning and deceptions by their [[H.A.T.E.]] employers. Her delusional state could also account for her "memories" of being routinely subjected to abusive monster-hunting training by her father, like being left alone in childhood with a robotical nanny programmed to torture her whenever she wasn't able to reply to a question regarding monsters, or being forced by her father to kill monsters, as a [[toddler]], armed with simple [[cutlery]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #8</ref>

The character elected to suspend her college studies upon being recruited by [[Dirk Anger]] of [[H.A.T.E.]] to fight Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction (UWMD) alongside [[Monica Rambeau]], [[Tabitha Smith]], [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], and [[Captain (comics)|The Captain]]. Shortly after this recruiting Elsa and her teammates found H.A.T.E. to be funded by the [[Beyond CorporationÂ©]], which is in fact a terrorist organization.<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #1</ref> Using the stolen Marketing Plan of Beyond, the Nextwave squad traveled across the country destroying hidden UWMDs which included [[Fin Fang Foom]], [[Mindless Ones]], and [[Forbush Man]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #2</ref><ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #7-8</ref><ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #9-10</ref>

She suffers constant abuses by her teammembers, like being confronted by [[Tabitha Smith]] about her European origins and accent (referred even in the ''Nextwave Theme Song'' as her main characteristic), and constantly ogled by [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], attracted by her [[breast|large chest]].<ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #9</ref><ref>''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.'' #2 (among others...)</ref>

===The Initiative and Beyond===
Recently Elsa joined up as part of Iron Man and the government's [[Fifty State Initiative]]. Elsa has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear to have signed the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and become part of the Initiative.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> She later returns to her monster-hunting adventures: still with her brasher mind-set, seen in her Nextwave days, she vows solemnly to never have children on her own, since she feels the responsibility of being a Bloodstone too heavy to be forced on another living being. Instead, she chooses to end her legacy once and for all, completing the task of freeing humanity from monsters before dying.<ref>''Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular'' #2 (2009)</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Elsa Bloodstone is shown as one of the teachers at the Braddock Academy (the British equivalent of the [[Avengers Academy]]), where she takes her brother [[Cullen Bloodstone]] to attend.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #5</ref>

Elsa Bloodstone is later recruited to join the [[Fearless Defenders]].<ref>''Fearless Defenders'' #8</ref>

Elsa later appears in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'' where she visits Cullen and argues with him in the S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center after [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]] killed Arcade.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #4 </ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Elsa Bloodstone is among the heroes recruited by an inverted [[Doctor Doom]] to join his team of Avengers.<ref>''Avengers World'' #15</ref>

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Elsa has exhibited superhuman strength, speed, durability and endurance, and a regenerative ability. She appears to possess all of the abilities her father once had{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.  In addition, she has demonstrated immunity to vampire bites (her blood will kill a vampire if consumed and the original Bloodgem fragment itself is anathema to vampires).

In the ''Bloodstone'' series, Elsa claimed that she had inherited at least some of the Bloodgem power genetically, but it has also been shown that her powers of strength and invulnerability were bestowed upon her by the Bloodgem fragment she wears on a choker, although she does not appear to be wearing it in ''Nextwave #8'' flashbacks to her childhood training sessions. She has also been portrayed as an expert [[marksman]].

She has been shown to use a removable Bloodgem on a choker as well as a number of artifacts gathered by her father. These include a lamp which contained a [[genie]] whom Ulysses had enslaved years ago. This serves as an early warning system, lighting up during times of supernatural crisis, and transporting him to said crisis. In ''Nextwave'', she carries a guitar case with a false cover, containing two [[Uzi]]s and a rifle.

==Other versions==
===Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas===
In an archaeological expedition, Elsa and her team find the stone statue of [[Fin Fang Foom]].<ref>''Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas'' #1 (2008)</ref>  She sells this statue to [[Tony Stark]] for the opening of his new casino only for the statue to release the actual dragon himself from his stone tomb.<ref>''Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas'' #2 (2008)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
{{Main|Marvel Zombies}}
Elsa Bloodstone alongside the other members of Nextwave show up "in a purely superfluous [[cameo appearance|cameo]]" in the third issue of the ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' to save [[Ash Williams|Ash]] from a [[Zombie|zombified]] [[Power Pack]], before being "Ruthlessly dispatched off-panel in the most humiliating and degrading ways imaginable" moments later.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' #3 (2007)</ref>
