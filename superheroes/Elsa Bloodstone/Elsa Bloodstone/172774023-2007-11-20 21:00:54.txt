'''Elsa Bloodstone''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] {{Fact|date=July 2007}} in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe incorporating elements of [[Lara Croft]] and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}} She first appears in Marvel's ''Bloodstone'' mini-series of 2001.

==Publication history==
Elsa appeared as the lead character in the ''Bloodstone'' miniseries and later appeared as a team member in the ''Nextwave'' series. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Bloodstone series===
Beautiful and feisty Elsa Bloodstone is the daughter of famous monster hunter [[Ulysses Bloodstone]]. Following her parents' breakup when she was two years old, Elsa accompanied her mother across Europe. Despite never knowing her father, Elsa remained curious about him. Though ignorant of her father's career, she was plagued by dreams about vampires and other creatures of the night. Shortly after Elsa's 18th birthday, Ulysses died and left his Boston home (the Bloodstone House) to Elsa and her pregnant mother, along with all of its contents, accumulated during his millennia of adventures. Arriving in Boston, Elsa encountered several unique individuals affiliated with her father: Charles Barnabus, a pureblood vampire lawyer and executor of the estate; the clerk Mr. Dluga, his teenage son Tomas and his vampire-hating grandfather Papa Dluga; and Adam, the caretaker of the house. Actually the Frankenstein Monster, Adam helped indoctrinate Elsa into her true heritage, offering her the mystic Bloodstone Choker which bonded with and empowered Elsa. Adam also gave her other items from her father's collection, including a mystic lamp that contained a captured djinn ("genie") and served as an early-warning detection system, glowing whenever a mystical threat was active in the world. Using the lamp, Elsa encountered Dracula in Bosnia and later helped the Living Mummy defeat the resurrected Egyptian necromancer Rakses. Elsa then became embroiled in a Nosferati vampire plot to infect Dracula, Barnabus and other pureblood vampires with a virus, turning them into an eternal source of nourishment for the Nosferati. Elsa confronted Nosferatu himself, her Bloodstone Choker destroying the vampire when he tried to bite her. After those events, Elsa and her mother had elected to remain at Bloodstone House, turning it into a curiosity shop run by her mother while Elsa continues exploring the family vocation of monster hunting in between college classes.

===Nextwave series===

Elsa elected to suspend her college studies upon being recruited by Dirk Anger of H.A.T.E. to fight Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction (UWMD) alongside Monica Rambeau, Tabitha Smith, Aaron Stack, and The Captain (Nextwave). Shortly after this recruiting Elsa and her teammates found H.A.T.E to be funded by the Beyond Corporation, which is in fact a terrorist organization. Using the stolen Marketing Plan of the Beyond Corporation, the Nextwave squad traveled across the country destroying hidden UWMDs which included Fin Fang Foom, Mindless Ones, and Forbush Man (although many of these may have been a type of clone, as the Beyond Corporation has shown ability to grow its own foot soldiers and super-beings).
 
===Avengers===
After the apparent destruction of the creative power behind the Beyond Corporation, Elsa and the rest of Nextwave team then joined up as part of Iron Man and the government's Fifty States Initiative. Elsa has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear to have signed the Superhuman Registration Act and are to become part of the [[Avengers: the Initiative|the Initiative]].<ref>http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map</ref>.
 
===Contradictions===
In ''Nextwave'', Elsa states she comes from "a line of near-immortal monster hunters", and has been trained since infancy by her father, Ulysses Bloodstone and an android nanny called 'Hate Mother' to fight supernatural evils. However, in ''Bloodstone'', Elsa states that she had no prior training and had not seen her father since she was a toddler, and did not have any memories of him at all.
The contradictions between Elsa's past as related in ''Bloodstone'' and her past as related in the ''Nextwave'' has given rise to speculation about whether the ''Nextwave'' stories should be seen as occurring in the main Marvel continuity or not.<ref>In a 2005 interview, writer [[Warren Ellis]] commenting on his Nextwave stories stated: "I think it has to be a self contained universe. It takes from Marvel history, but I wouldn't necessarily want to drag mainstream Marvel into it for fear of what I would do to it.‚Äù [Jennifer M. Contino (2005-12-08). "Ellis Talks Nextwave & Ultimate Extinction", http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004516] In 2006 Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] stated that "for the time being" Nextwave is set in an universe separate from the main Marvel continuity [Wade Gum (2006-07-01). "Heros Con: Joe Quesada Panel", http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm]</ref> In contradiction to these earlier statements, recent Marvel publications such as ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' and ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' (February 2007) seem to portray Nextwave's activities as occurring in the mainstream Marvel continuity.  However, Nextwave's entry in ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' states: "Recent intelligence suggests some or all Nextwave members unknowingly had their memories and/or personalities altered by their new employers (H.A.T.E.)". The Nextwave entry in ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' may be evidence of an editorial decision to include the Nextwave team in the main Marvel continuity in a way that provides a plot device to explain away inconsistencies caused by the previous editorial position that ''Nextwave'' was set in an alternate universe.

==Powers and abilities==
Elsa has exhibited superhuman strength, speed, durability and endurance, and a regenerative ability. She appears to possess all of the abilities her father once had.  In addition, She has demonstrated immunity to vampire bites (her blood will destroy a vampire if consumed and the original Bloodgem fragment itself is anathema to vampires).  

In the ''Bloodstone'' series, Elsa claimed that she had inherited at least some of the Bloodgem power genetically, but it has also been shown that her powers of strength and invulnerability were bestowed upon her by the Bloodgem fragment she wears on a choker, although she does not appear to be wearing it in ''Nextwave #8'' flashbacks to her childhood training sessions. She has also been portrayed as an expert markswoman.

===Equipment===
*Removable Bloodgem on a choker.
*A number of artifacts gathered by her father, including a lamp which contained a [[genie]] whom Ulysses had enslaved years ago, which served as an early warning system, lighting up during times of supernatural crisis, and transporting him to said crisis. 
*In Nextwave, carries a guitar case with a false cover, containing two Uzis and rifles.

==Appearances==
* ''Bloodstone'' #1-4 (2001-2002)
* ''Nextwave'' #1-12 (2006)
* ''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' #3 (2007)
