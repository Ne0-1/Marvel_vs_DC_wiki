'''Elsa Bloodstone''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appears in the [[Bloodstone (comics)|Bloodstone]] mini-series of 2001. Elsa Bloodstone was created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Michael Lopez



==''Bloodstone'' Series Biography==
Elsa's father, [[Bloodstone (comics)|Bloodstone]], met and married a woman named Elise<ref>''Bloodstone'' #1</ref>. Elise gave birth to his daughter Elsa, but Ulysses and Elise separated when Elsa was two years old. Ulysses distanced himself from both, and Elsa never knew him as she grew up. Bloodstone trusted Adam the [[Frankenstein (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]] to give his daughter Elsa a fragment of the Bloodgem in a choker when she was old enough. After Ulysses left, Elise and Elsa traveled across Europe, settling in England where Elsa is schooled. Elsa began to have increasingly frequent dreams about monsters, such as vampires. Eventually she and her mother learned of Ulysses' death, and they flew to Boston to settle his estate.[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bloodstoneelsa.htm]

As ''Bloodstone'' begins, Elsa and Elise arrive at '''Bloodstone House''', where they are given a tour by the executor of Ulysses' estate, Charles Barnabas. Exploring the house, Elsa discovers a secret chamber in which she encounters Adam who tells Elsa about her father. Adam gives her the Bloodstone Choker, which attaches itself to her neck. After grabbing a flashing [[genie]] lamp, she is transported to Bosnia in the midst of a struggle between [[Tomb of Dracula|Dracula]] and the Nosferati.[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bloodstoneelsa.htm]

Dracula recognizes the Bloodgem fragment and attacks Elsa, but is blasted away by the Bloodstone Choker. Dracula is then impaled by the Nosferatu, who take him away, while Adam returns Elsa to Bloodstone House. Adam later designs a costume for Elsa, patterned after her father's. The two then have the lamp transport them to Egypt, where they met [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]]. Elsa later confronts Nosferatu himself, who bites her but is destroyed by the Bloodgem energy in her blood. She and her allies free Dracula who then exposes the Nosferati to sunlight, destroying them.[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bloodstoneelsa.htm] 

Elsa lives in Bloodstone Manor with her mother and ally Adam the Frankenstein Monster; she has befriended Charles Barnabus, a pureblood vampire lawyer and executor of the Bloodstone estate. Pursuing a monster-hunting occupation, she begins an online [[blog]] to create an electronic encyclopedic reference guide for the numerous monsters and alien beasts in the [[Marvel Universe]] (published by Marvel as '''''Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters''''', albeit written in a very American tone, in contrast to Elsa's English disposition).

==''Nextwave'' Series Biography==
[[Image:Elsaincolor.png|thumb|130px|left|Elsa in ''[[Nextwave]]'',<br />art by [[Stuart Immonen]].]]
The origins of the ''Nextwave'' version of Elsa are quite different; she says she comes from 'a line of near-immortal monster hunters', and has been trained by her father and an android nanny called 'Hate Mother' to fight supernatural evils since infancy. Her relationship with Ulysses seems to have been wildly abusive.  

She possesses superhuman strength and invulnerability. The 'primer' page in each issue states that her powers were bestowed upon her by the Bloodgem she wears on a choker, although she does not appear to be wearing it in issue #8's flashbacks to her childhood training sessions. She is an expert markswoman, and often carries two [[shotguns]] and two [[handguns]], sometimes stowed in a guitar case. 

She is [[United Kingdom|English]], and as yet has made no mention of a family home in Boston.

The ''Nextwave'' version of Elsa is a natural redhead.

==Powers and Abilities==
In the ''Bloodstone'' series, Elsa claimed that she had inherited at least some of the Bloodgem power genetically; in Nextwave #8 we see her as an infant and as a teenager besting monsters and undergoing combat training without the choker. The original series had been ambiguous as to whether she might retain her supernatural abilities when not in contact with the gem. 

She has exhibited super strength, speed, durability and endurance, and a regenerative ability. She has also demonstrated immunity to vampire bites; her blood will destroy a vampire if consumed, and the original Bloodgem fragment itself was an anathema to vampires.

She may possess all of the abilities her father once had. 

==Equipment==
*Removable Bloodgem on a choker.
*A number of artifacts gathered by her father, including a lamp which contained a [[genie]] whom Ulysses had enslaved years ago, which served as an early warning system, lighting up during times of supernatural crisis, and transporting him to said crisis.

==Appearances==
*Bloodstone #1-4 (2001-2002)
*Nextwave #1-12 (2006)
