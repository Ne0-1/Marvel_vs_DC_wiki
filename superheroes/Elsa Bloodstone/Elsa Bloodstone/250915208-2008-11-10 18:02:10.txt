'''Elsa Bloodstone''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She first appears in Marvel's ''Bloodstone'' [[limited series|mini-series]] of [[2001 in comics|2001]] written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]].

As she is a young, female monster-hunter there are potential similarities with [[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]], although when asked about this the authors said "neither of us have seen an episode of ''Buffy'' all the way through! I know we're missing out on some great TV but we've determined to steer clear of Buffy at least while we're doing Bloodstone."<ref>[http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/dec01/abnett_lanning.shtml New DnA], Sequential Tart, December 2001</ref>

==Publication history==
Elsa appeared as the lead character in the ''Bloodstone'' mini-series and has been mentioned in the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].

Other versions of her have appeared in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' and as a team member in the ''[[Nextwave]]'' series. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Bloodstone===
Elsa lives in Bloodstone Manor with her mother and ally Adam the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein Monster]]; she has befriended Charles Barnabus, a pureblood vampire lawyer and executor of the Bloodstone estate.

===Marvel Monsters===
Pursuing a monster-hunting occupation, she begins an online [[blog]] to create an electronic encyclopedic reference guide for the numerous monsters and alien beasts in the [[Marvel Universe]] (published by Marvel as ''Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters'', albeit written in a very American tone, in contrast to Elsa's English disposition).

Elsa Bloodstone retained her mutant abilities during the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

===Avengers===
Recently Elsa joined up as part of Iron Man and the government's [[Fifty State Initiative]]. Elsa has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear to have signed the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and become part of the Initiative.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Elsa has exhibited superhuman strength, speed, durability and endurance, and a regenerative ability. She appears to possess all of the abilities her father once had.  In addition, She has demonstrated immunity to vampire bites (her blood will destroy a vampire if consumed and the original Bloodgem fragment itself is anathema to vampires).  

In the ''Bloodstone'' series, Elsa claimed that she had inherited at least some of the Bloodgem power genetically, but it has also been shown that her powers of strength and invulnerability were bestowed upon her by the Bloodgem fragment she wears on a choker, although she does not appear to be wearing it in ''Nextwave #8'' flashbacks to her childhood training sessions. She has also been portrayed as an expert [[marksman]].

She has been shown to use a removable Bloodgem on a choker as well as a number of artifacts gathered by her father. These include a lamp which contained a [[genie]] whom Ulysses had enslaved years ago. This serves as an early warning system, lighting up during times of supernatural crisis, and transporting him to said crisis. In ''Nextwave'', she carries a guitar case with a false cover, containing two [[Uzi]]s and a rifle.

==Other versions==
===Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas===
Elsa appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas]]'' mini-series.

===Marvel Zombies===
{{main|Marvel Zombies}}
Elsa Bloodstone alongside the other members of Nextwave show up "in a purely superfluous [[cameo appearance|cameo]]" in the third issue of the ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' to save [[Ash Williams|Ash]] from a [[Zombie|zombified]] [[Power Pack]], before being "humiliatingly and ruthlessly dispatched off-panel" moments later.

===Nextwave===

Elsa Bloodstone has also appeared in ''[[Nextwave]]'', but the series' connection to the Marvel Universe is unclear - it was initially out-of-continuity<ref>Jennifer M. Contino (2005-12-08). "[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004516 Ellis Talks Nextwave & Ultimate Extinction]", [[Comic-Con International]]</ref> <ref>Wade Gum (2006-07-01). "[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm Heros Con: Joe Quesada Panel]", ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]''</ref> but has recently been portrayed as the adventures of tourists from [[Earth-A]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #21 (2007)</ref> <ref>For further details on this see [[Nextwave#Continuity]]</ref> However ''[[Civil War]]: Damage Report'' suggest that at least parts of the adventures of the team were set in the main continuity: the other were delusions brought by costant use of drugs, mental conditioning and deceptions by their [[H.A.T.E.]] employers. Her delusional state could also account for her "memories" of being routinely subjected to abusive monster-hunting training by her father, like being left alone in childhood with a robotical nanny programmed to torture her whenever she wasn't able to reply to a question regarding monsters, or being forced by her father to kill monsters, as a [[toddler]], armed with simple [[cutlery]].

The character elected to suspend her college studies upon being recruited by [[Dirk Anger]] of [[H.A.T.E.]] to fight Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction (UWMD) alongside [[Monica Rambeau]], [[Tabitha Smith]], [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], and [[Captain (comics)|The Captain]]. Shortly after this recruiting Elsa and her teammates found H.A.T.E. to be funded by the [[Beyond CorporationÂ©]], which is in fact a terrorist organization. Using the stolen Marketing Plan of Beyond, the Nextwave squad traveled across the country destroying hidden UWMDs which included [[Fin Fang Foom]], [[Mindless Ones]], and [[Forbush Man]].

Despite being one of the most trained and serious members of the group, she suffers constant abuses by her teammembers, like being confronted by [[Tabitha Smith]] about her European origins and accent (referred even in the ''Nextwave Theme Song'' as her main characteristic), and constantly ogled by [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], attracted by her [[breast|large chest]].
