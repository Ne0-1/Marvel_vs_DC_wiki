'''Pixie''' ('''Megan Gwynn''') is the name of a [[fictional character]] in [[comic books]] of the [[Marvel Universe]].  Formerly a member of the Xavier Institute's Paragons training squad, Megan Gwynn is a cheerful girl who seems to have no difficulties integrating herself with her fellow students and squad members.<ref>http://www.marvel.com/universe/Pixie_(Megan_Gwynn)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Paragons Squad===

Megan Gwynn is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] teenager.  After enrolling at the Xavier Institute, Gwynn became a part of the Paragon training squad under the tutelage of former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]]. During this time, she developed a crush on the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. She always wore a bicycle helmet during training sessions.

===Post M-Day===

Gwynn has proven herself to be an amiable and cheerful student, and she fit in well with her squad, even being voted Friendliest Student<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X: Yearbook Special''</ref>.  Following the events of [[House of M]], almost all of the Institute's students were [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]], leading to the dissolution of the school's training squads. Gwynn is one of only twenty seven students, along with her fellow former Paragons, [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], and [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]], to have retained her mutant abilities.

Forty-two of Gwynn's former classmates died when their bus was attacked by forces of [[William Stryker]], an anti-mutant bigot. Among the confirmed deaths was Gywnn's fellow Paragon, DJ.

===Quest for Magik===

Pixie, along with [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], and [[Match (comics)|Match]], were told a frightening ghost story by their fellow student, Blindfold, one night at the school. Pixie, frightened by the story, tells [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] that she doesn't like her anymore. Blindfold apologizes to her and told her, "I'm sorry for your loss". It soon turned out that this tale wasn't a story at all, but rather a vision of things past and of things to come. The group was soon sucked down into the realm of Limbo, where they were immediately attacked by a mob of demons. Pixie stays by Blindfold's side during the fight, and Blindfold cautions Pixie and the others that Gwynn must not "fall into darkness". She was shown using her powers for the first time, incapacitating several demons with her "pixie dust", causing them to suffer psychadelic hallucinations. After [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] saves the small group, she asks [[N'astirh]] to bring Megan to her. Despite her friends' trying to stop her, Megan gave into Magik's request for a soul to create a [[Soulsword]] which actually resembles a Soulknife. Illyana then explains that the knife is actually a portion of Pixie's own soul and that black magic has now filled the hole left behind in the knife's creation, leaving Pixie to no longer be an innocent personality as well as changing a great portion of her hair black instead of the previous pink.

Pixie is taught a teleportation spell by Illyana she teleports her and her friends to Belasco to stop him from torturing the rest of the team. She is then told that in order to save her friends she must use her knife to stab Belasco. Initially hesitant, Pixie follows through with her orders and loses more of her innocence by killing the villain. After defeating Belasco and escaping from Limbo, Pixie was officially made a member of the team.<ref>http://en.marveldatabase.com/Megan_Gwynn_(Earth-616)</ref>

Blindfold later states that Pixie will soon be injured.

===Messiah Complex===
Upon returning from Limbo, Pixie joins [[X-23]], [[Hellion]], [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], [[Armor (comics)|Armor]] and [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] in attacking the Washington DC base of the [[Purifiers]] by teleporting them there.  They are opposed by [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]].

When Julian is injured and the Reavers are about to attack, Pixie panics and cannot teleport the team out until [[Rictor]], who infiltrated the Purifiers as a spy, tells her to concentrate or else they'll all die.  Pixie does so, but blindly teleports the team, scattering them between Washington, D.C. and the Xavier Institute.  Injured, she mentally calls out to Emma Frost, breaking Emma's concentration to the fight between a group of X-Men and the Marauders.

==Powers and abilities==
Gwynn possesses insect-like wings (depicted of various colors, depending on the artist) that allow her to fly.  In addition, she produces a "pixie dust" that causes [[hallucination]]s, often to comedic effect, such as demons seeing bright bubbles and teddy bears, and, in one instance, Logan seeing a herd of unicorns and subsequently trying to tear them apart. He still never wants her to dust him again. It is unknown if she has any conscious control over these hallucinations, but mentioned once that she has no idea what her victims are seeing.  She also possesses a [[Soulsword|souldagger]] capable of disrupting magic and harming magic-based creatures and claims to know a little magic and has thus far demonstrated only a teleportation spell, taught to her by Magik. She states that she has been consulted by both [[Amanda Sefton|Amanda Sefton]] and [[Doctor Strange|Doctor Strange]] about furthering her magical tutelage when she comes of age.
