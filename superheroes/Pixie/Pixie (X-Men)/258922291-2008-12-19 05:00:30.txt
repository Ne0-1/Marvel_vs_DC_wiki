'''Pixie''' ('''Megan Gwynn''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  She is notable as a member of the former [[New X-Men]] team and is now part of the [[Uncanny X-Men]] team.

==Fictional character biography==
Megan Gwynn is a [[Wales|Welsh]] teenager from a fictional [[coal mining|mining town]] called Abergylid. Her father died in the mine and because of that she had a [[phobia|fear]] of the mine. In her original inception she had short pink hair, pure black eyes and butterfly-like rainbow wings. Subsequent artists drew her wings in different ways and neglected to make her eyes black. When [[Skottie Young]] was brought on board a fan asked him to bring back the black eyes which he happily obliged.

===Paragons squad===
[[Image:Pixieteam.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Pixie and her team]]
After enrolling at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], Pixie became a part of the [[Paragons (comics)|Paragons]] training squad under the tutelage of former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]] member [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair]]. She also always wore a bicycle helmet during training sessions. 

During this time, she developed a crush on the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and was considered a cheerful girl who fit in well with other students; she was even voted Friendliest Student.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Pixie_(Megan_Gwynn) Pixie (Megan Gwynn) - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===M-Day===
Following the events of [[House of M]], almost all of the Institute's students were [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]], which led to the dissolution of the school's training squads. Pixie was one of only twenty-seven students, including her fellow Paragons [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], and [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]], not to have lost her mutant abilities.

She participated in Emma Frost's Battle Royale which determined who will train to be an X-Man. Later, forty-two of Pixie's former classmates died when their bus was attacked by [[William Stryker]], an anti-mutant crusader. Among the confirmed deaths was Gwynn's fellow Paragon, [[DJ (comics)|DJ]].

===Quest For Magik===
Pixie, along with [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], Wolf Cub, [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], and Match, were told a frightening [[ghost story]] by their fellow student [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] one night at the school. However, the story was not fictitious but rather a prophesy; telling Pixie that she is "sorry for [her] loss," Pixie and her classmates were sucked into the realm of [[Otherplace|Limbo]], where they were immediately attacked by a mob of demons. 

Pixie stayed by Blindfold's side during the fight, and Blindfold cautioned Pixie and the others that Pixie must not "fall to darkness."  Pixie used her powers on-panel for the first time during the fight, incapacitating several demons with her "pixie dust."  After [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] saves the small group, she asks [[N'astirh]] to bring Pixie to her. Despite her friends' pleas, Megan submitted to Magik's request for a soul to create a [[Soulsword]], but due to Anole’s intervention, the spell wasn’t finished resulting in the creation of a soul ''dagger'' instead.  Magik then explained that the soul dagger is actually a portion of Pixie's own soul and that [[black magic]] has now filled the hole left behind in the knife's creation, leaving Pixie no longer as innocent - as well as changing a great portion of her pink hair to black.

Pixie was taught a [[teleportation]] [[magic (paranormal)|spell]] by Magik and Pixie used it to teleport herself and her friends to [[Belasco]] to stop him from torturing the rest of the team. Telling Magik that she must use the Souldagger to stab Belasco in order to save her friends, Pixie asked Magik why she chose Pixie; Magik responds that Pixie is the most innocent of all her friends and that, in Limbo, innocence is power.  Pixie followed Magik's instructions and kills Belasco, losing more of her innocence. 

After defeating Belasco, Magik wanted to use more of Pixie's soul to create more bloodstones but changed her mind when she saw [[Colossus (comics)|her brother]] and sends Pixie and the others back to the Xavier Institute. Pixie was then made a official member of the [[New X-Men]] by insistence of [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]].

===Children of X-Men===
Sitting in the medical lab with [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] and [[Gentle (comics)|Nezhno]], Pixie revealed that [[Doctor Strange]] will tutor her in magic when she comes of age. She also questioned Dust about her religion, incorrectly referring to Dust's [[abaya]] and [[niqāb]] as a [[burqa]].  Corrected by Nezhno, she gushes over how he protected her in Limbo. 

Shortly thereafter, she participated in a training session with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] where she made him see [[unicorn]]s. She was also questioned by [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] about her age and [[Hellion]] assumed she is the youngest because she is the most immature.

===Blinded By The Light===

Pixie, along with the other New X-Men takes part in a battle against the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] when they attacked the Xavier Institute seeking to obtain the [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of truth|Destiny Diaries]] and eliminate Blindfold.

===Messiah Complex===
When the first new mutant since M-Day appeared, Pixie joined [[X-23]], Hellion, Anole, [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], [[Armor (comics)|Armor]], and Rockslide in attacking the [[Washington, D.C.]] base of the anti-mutant [[Purifiers]] by teleporting them there. They were confronted by [[Lady Deathstrike]] and the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. When Hellion is injured and the Reavers are about to attack, Pixie panics and cannot teleport the team out until [[Rictor]], who infiltrated the Purifiers as a spy, helps her concentrate. Pixie does so but blindly teleports the team, scattering them between Washington, D.C. and the Xavier Institute. Injured, she mentally calls out to [[Emma Frost]], breaking Emma's concentration on the fight between a group of X-Men and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].

Later, back at the mansion, she is with several other students and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] when [[Predator X]] attacks several students outside, then changes tactics to go after the weaker wounded students in the infirmary. Pixie, realizing that X-23 had killed this type of creature before, attempts to teleport Predator X to X-23's location, but mistakenly takes the majority of the students and Beast along with her and the creature, dropping them in the middle of the X-Men's fight with the Marauders on [[Muir Island]].

During the fight, Pixie is brutally beaten by the [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauders)|Malice]]-possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]], who taunts Pixie until Megan unexpectedly stabs her foe with her soul dagger, exorcising Malice from Omega Sentinel's body.

She is later seen being consoled by Mercury after [[Professor X]] is shot and mortally wounded.

===''Pixies and Demons''===
Following the events of Messiah Complex, Pixie returns to her hometown in ''Free Comic Book Day: X-Men'' (2008) to find the [[N'Garai]] have plagued the town and are kidnapping people to feed Kierrok the Damned, their leader. Pixie calls in the X-Men to help defeat the N’Garai and Megan has to face her fear of the mine in which her father was killed to defeat the demons plaguing her town. After defeating Kierrok, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and the rest of the X-Men take her back to America and she joins the newly reformed X-Men in San Francisco.

===Manifest Destiny===
After leaving one of [[Dazzler|Dazzler]]'s gigs, Pixie is ambushed by a group of masked anti-mutant men calling themselves the [[Hellfire Cult]] while leaving a club. She is overpowered by the attackers and is subjected to beatings that leave her incapacitated. She manages to make her way back to the X-Men's new base and is immediately taken care of by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].

While in recovery, Beast organises for Dazzler to come meet Pixie to make her feel better. Pixie is offered a gig by Dazzler but turns her down and later sneaks out to hang with some art kids only to be caught by Wolverine. He asks her if she really wants to hang out with them instead of her friends in Marin. Pixie says it hasn't been a great year for her and confesses she just wants to be a normal girl to which Wolverine replies she isn't. Later Pixie realises her mistake, ditches her art friends and goes to crash with some friends, wondering what could possibly go wrong.

She goes to find the X-Men out in the field to assist them and helps take down [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], whose powers have grown and are out of control. After beating him up, she stabs him in the head with her soul dagger leaving him blind and his powers weakened. Afterwards she is seen dancing onstage at one of Dazzler's gigs.

===Secret Invasion===
Pixie fights alongside the X-Men when the Skrulls invade San Francisco. She later acts as bait for the Skrulls.

===X-Infernus===
{{main|X-Infernus}}
While training with Nightcrawler, he brings up her soul dagger which Meggan isn't happy about. Kurt points out that people have noticed when she uses it, her personality changes. Pixie begins to cry and summons her soul dagger, her personality changes and she stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. Mercury and Rockslide who are watching the session rush in and pull her away from from Kurt. Beast enters and is shocked at what he finds. Pixie's soul dagger is stuck in Kurt's chest and when she removes it, she releases the Soulsword. Magik, who suddenly senses the Soulsword being drawn, teleports into the X-Men's base to reclaim it.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Pixie_fighting_N'Garai.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pixie uses her pixie dust power]] 
Gwynn possesses insect-like wings (depicted of various colors, depending on the artist) that allow her to fly. Initially, her wings were broad and multicoloured, similar to a butterfly's, but recent depictions have her with iridescent, translucent wings, more like those of a dragonfly.  In addition, she produces a "pixie dust" that causes [[hallucination]]s, often to comedic effect, such as demons seeing bright bubbles and teddy bears, and, in one instance, Wolverine seeing a herd of unicorns and subsequently trying to tear them apart.  In another instance, Megan uses her dust seemingly harmlessly to enhance the audience's perceptions of Dazzler's light show during a concert.  She states that she has no idea what individuals affected by her dust are seeing.

After [[Magik]] took part of Megan's soul in an attempt to create a  [[Soulsword]], her appearance was changed, reflecting the portion of her soul lost to black magic. Her formerly pink hair became mostly black and her multicoloured wings are left tattered. As the spell to steal Megan's soul was interrupted, a new Soulsword could not be formed; instead Megan can summon a [[soul dagger]], a mystical item that disrupts magical constructs. 

Though untrained in the mystic arts, Pixie can recite the incantation taught to her by Illyana Rasputin to teleport over long distances.  Following the events of "Quest for Magik," Pixie was approached by both Doctor Strange and Amanda Sefton to receive formal tutelage in sorcery after she has come of age. 

She also has the ability to find evil supernatural creatures as evidenced when she fought the [[N'Garai]] who were under a cloaking spell. When asked how she knows where they are she replies “There’s a sliver of darkness that Magik put inside my soul… And it’s like a compass needle for other dark… stuff.”

==Other Media==
===Television===
Pixie appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "X-Calibre" voiced by [[Kate Higgins]].  She is depicted as having her trademark pink hair and colorful pixie wings.  The only ability she displays is flight.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' Ep. 6</ref> She is later seen arriving in Genosha in episode 10.
