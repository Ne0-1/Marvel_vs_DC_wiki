'''''Bloodlines''''' was a 1993 comicbook storyline published by [[DC Comics]]. It was an intracompany [[fictional crossover|crossover]] that ran through DC's superhero [[annual publication|annuals]] and was bookended by two 'Bloodbath' specials written by [[Dan Raspler]]. The antagonists were a race of monstrous [[Xenomorph (Alien)|xenomorph]]-like parasites who killed humans for their spinal fluid. A small fraction of the parasite's victims survived and become super-heroes via their ordeal. This plot device introduced a wave of "New Blood" super-heroes into the DC Universe. Five DC Comics series were spun out of the event: Blood Pack, Razosharp and the Psyba-Rats, Hitman, Anima and Gunfire.

==Publication history==
The villains of the crossover were the formerly imprisoned survivors of a race of alien parasites named '''Angon''', '''Gemir''', '''Glonth''', '''Lissick''', '''Pritor''', '''Ragnorak''', '''Venev''', and '''Slodd''' that could [[shapeshift]] into [[humanoid]] form. These humanoid forms were based on the initial entities they first encountered, a squadron of [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] soldiers, most of whom perished. The bite of the [[Bloodlines Parasites]] was administered to the back of the neck by a mouth-within-a-mouth. This bite is intended to remove the spinal fluid for sustenance. This usually killed the victim for food, but occasionally awakened [[superhuman]] powers in the recipient. This was also the means by which the creatures could reproduce.

Each of the annuals involved in the crossover used this [[plot device]] to introduce a new super-powered character to the [[DC Universe]]. The only character to attain any long-standing notoriety was [[Hitman (comics)|Hitman]], who first appeared in that year's ''[[The Demon (comics)|Demon]] Annual'' and went on to star in his own sixty-issue ongoing series.

The Bloodlines crossover event spanned 23 of DC's regular titles and wrapped up in the 2-part mini "Bloodbath". The alien parasites that came to Earth to gather spinal fluid sacrificed themselves to help birth a gigantic alien known as the '''Taker'''. Many long-term heroes were absorbed into the monster, only to be saved by the very heroes the parasites had created.

This series spun off into the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] mini-series. [[Gunfire (comics)|Gunfire]] also had a short-lived series. Some of the heroes created by the aliens died in the 2005-2006's [[Infinite Crisis]] event, but as was depicted in the Bloodlines specials, there were close to a thousand New Bloods in North America.

==Bloodlines Parasites==
===Origins===
The nine '''Bloodlines Parasites''' were created for the [[Bloodlines (comics)|Bloodlines]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. The parasites premiered in ''[[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]]'' annual vol. 2 #1 written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and drawn by Christian Alamy. The Parasites hail from the same [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimension]] as a powerful [[Shaman]] named '''Pax''' who gained his own powers due to being bitten by one of them and left for dead. The parasites escaped from their prison dimension and ended up on Earth, while there they took to feeding on humans. 

===Metagene===
The aliens feed by draining the spinal fluid of their prey after administering a small dose [[venom|paralytic venom]], if the feeding process is performed on a human possessing the [[Metahuman|metagene]], the [[Physical trauma|trauma]] of feeding on that victim will usually activate their metagene granting them [[List of comic book superpowers|superpowers]]. Those so activated took to calling themselves "New Bloods"<sup>(1)</sup> The nine aliens were '''Angon''', '''Gemir''', '''Glonth''', '''Pritor''', '''Slodd''', '''Lissick''', '''Venev''', '''Ragnorak''', and the '''Taker'''. 

===Parasites return===
A new group of parasitic aliens from the same universe infiltrated a space shuttle returning to earth. When the JLA sent Green Lantern to investigate, his ring's readings showed that these parasites had genetic similarities with the Bloodlines parasites.  These aliens, however, were much smaller and permanently attached themselves to their human hosts.  They controlled their hosts' minds, could communicate telepathically, and gave each non-superpowered host a superpower.  These new parasites managed to take control, or incapacitate the entire Justice League on the moon.  In order to stop them from reaching earth, [[Hitman]] (who was invited to the JLA Watchtower so that his blood could be analyzed) had to kill or maim several of the astronaut hosts.  While some members of the JLA felt that this was murder, others recognized that Hitman stopped the invasion the only way he could <sup>(2)</sup>.

== New Bloods ==

Some of the characters  whose metagens were activated by the parasites are [[Argus (comics)|Argus]], [[Loose Cannon (comics)|Loose Cannon]], Razorsharp, Terrorsmith, [[Hitman (comics)|Hitman]] and [[Gunfire (comics)|Gunfire]]. If too much parasite venom was absorbed by the host's system it would cause hideous abnormalities, as seen with Terrorsmith. The mother alien known as the Taker, was destroyed with the help of all the human new bloods. Pax helped banish these aliens by sealing them up in the other-dimensional home of the Taker.
