'''''Bloodlines''''' was a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] that spanned all of the [[annual publication|annuals]] published by [[DC Comics]] in [[1994]].

The villains of the crossover were a race of alien parasites that could [[shapeshift]] into [[humanoid]] form. The parasites' bite was administered to the back of the neck by a mouth-within-a-mouth obviously intended as a reference to the titular creature of the ''[[Alien (movie)|Alien]]'' series. This bite usually killed the victim for food but occasionally awakened [[superhuman]] powers in the recipient, as this was also the means by which the creatures could reproduce.

Each of the annuals involved in the crossover uses this [[plot device]] to introduce a new super-powered character to the [[DC Universe]]. The only one of these characters to attain any long-standing notoriety was [[Hitman (comics)|Hitman]], who first appeared in that year's ''[[The Demon (comics)|Demon]] Annual'' and went on to star in his own sixty-issue ongoing series.
