'''''Bloodlines''''' was an intracompany [[fictional crossover|crossover]] that spanned all of the [[annual publication|annuals]] published by [[DC Comics]] in [[1993]]. Two Bloodbath specials concluded the series, written by [[Dan Raspler]], with issue one drawn by Chuck Wojtkiewicz and issue two drawn by Sal Velluto. The alien parasites premiered in [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]] annual vol. 2 #1 written by [[Alan Grant]] and drawn by Christian Alamy.

==History==
The villains of the crossover were the formerly imprisoned survivors of a race of alien parasites named '''Angon''', '''Gemir''', '''Glonth''', '''Lissick''', '''Pritor''', '''Ragnorak''', '''Venev''', and '''Slodd''' that could [[shapeshift]] into [[humanoid]] form. The bite of the [[Bloodlines Parasites]] was administered to the back of the neck by a mouth-within-a-mouth (a reference to the titular creatures of the ''[[Alien (movie)|Alien]]'' series). This bite usually killed the victim for food but occasionally awakened [[superhuman]] powers in the recipient, as this was also the means by which the creatures could reproduce.

Each of the annuals involved in the crossover used this [[plot device]] to introduce a new super-powered character to the [[DC Universe]]. The only character to attain any long-standing notoriety was [[Hitman (comics)|Hitman]], who first appeared in that year's ''[[The Demon (comics)|Demon]] Annual'' and went on to star in his own sixty-issue ongoing series.

The Bloodlines crossover event spanned 23 of DC's regular titles and wrapped up in the 2-part mini "Bloodbath". The three alien parasites that came to Earth to gather spinal fluid sacrificed themselves to help birth a gigantic alien known as the '''Taker'''. A number of the so-called "New Bloods", former members of a nineties team called the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] were killed off in the final issue of 2005-2006's [[Infinite Crisis]] event.
