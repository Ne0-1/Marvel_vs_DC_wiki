First appearing in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #251 (July 1978), Count Vertigo is the last descendant of the royal family that ruled the small [[eastern European]] country of Vlatava that was taken over by the [[Soviet]]s and later became devastated by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book|last = Wallace|first = Dan|author-link =|contribution = Count Vertigo|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 88|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017|postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Fictional character biography==
===Starting his career===
Count Vertigo first appeared in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], where he attempted to steal back the jewels his parents had sold when they escaped to [[England]] after the war. The victim of a hereditary inner [[ear]] defect that affected his balance, Vertigo had a small electronic device implanted in his right temple that compensated this problem. Tinkering with the device, Vertigo learned he was able to affect other people’s balance as well, distorting their perceptions so that they literally couldn’t tell up from down, an effect known as [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]. Donning a costume and taking the name "Count Vertigo", he embarked on a life of crime. This would bring him in conflict with the heroes [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Running with the Suicide Squad===
He would later come to join the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for a shortened prison sentence, and it was revealed that he was plagued by [[bipolar disorder]]. After the Suicide Squad disbanded for the first time, Count Vertigo was captured by Vlatavan rebels, who wished to use his powers to overthrow the current Vlatavan government. They used a variety of [[medication|drugs]] on him, each with a differing effect on the Count, as he would for example suddenly see himself as an Angel of Vengeance, sent to wreak havoc on the current rulers. Although he largely believed himself master of his own will, his mood swings were completely subject to his captors.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He was captured by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] when the Suicide Squad came in and resolved the conflict and Kaligari (then-ruler of Vlatava) was murdered. Count Vertigo was Poison Ivy's [[Slavery|slave]] for a long period of time, during which he grew to hate Poison Ivy and frequently threatened to kill her when he was free of her control. Amanda Waller was able to free Vertigo of her control so that he could stop a group of missiles hitting [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] at the behest of the villain [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]].
Vertigo succeeded, and it turned out that as he went into rehab and expunged the chemicals that had been pumped into his body by both Ivy and the rebels, that he was unwittingly cured of the disorder that had plagued him for so long. This was something he found hard to deal with and he approached [[Deadshot]], one of his teammates, hoping that Deadshot would be willing to end his life. As it happened, Deadshot was unmoved by his teammate's plight, and saw no problem in killing once again. However, he cautioned Vertigo to make his mind - after all, he would not fail or hesitate.

In the meantime, he was also approached by members of the Vlatavan government, who sought to see Count Vertigo reclaim his rightful place as ruler. He declined, stating that he wasn't fit to rule at this point, as he wasn't even sure if he wanted to live or die.

Although willing, Deadshot warned him to think it through, because Deadshot would not hesitate, and Vertigo had better be sure this is what he wanted. The running subplot would ultimately culminate in the last pages of the first volume of the Suicide Squad, in which Deadshot and Vertigo stood across one another, Deadshot ready to kill him. Count Vertigo realised that this was ultimately an indirect [[suicide]], and that would ruin his chances for the [[afterlife]]. Deciding for now that he would deal with the disease that now indirectly plagued him, he walked away from the duel.

Vertigo also resolved his grudge with Poison Ivy. During the [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]] crossover, he was perfectly willing to let her die when he found her abandoned on an Amazonian island; ironically, she was bound and promised whoever freed her her undying devotion. Snickering snidely, Vertigo left her to die in the ruins of the collapsing temple they were in. Still, Ivy was saved, and Count Vertigo would later reluctantly work alongside her in the Suicide Squad, leaving their grudge be.

===The destruction of Vlatava===
Ultimately, Count Vertigo did return to his homeland in order to ensure that he would once more become the country's rightful ruler. While his forces were at war with the government's army, the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] appeared, and already unhinged, was horrified by the slaughter that occurred. In a fit of rage he deemed the entire country and its inhabitants to be full of sin and decided to cleanse it, leaving behind only Vlatava's president at the time and Count Vertigo.

===Grudges and a new Injustice Society===
Working for the American government for a while, Count Vertigo eventually sought out his old enemy [[Green Arrow]] and after the two had a fight, Count Vertigo decided to leave the vendetta behind and focus on more positive prospects, getting his life back on track. Afterwards he showed up as a member of the new [[Injustice Society]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He also shows up as an operative of the Suicide Squad when they attempt to dissaude the Justice League from investigating the "[[Salvation Run]]" project.

===''Infinite Crisis'', 52 and One Year Later===
Count Vertigo has been seen among [[Lex Luthor]]'s ranks in the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

He appeared during the 52-week series, as a member of a Suicide Squad led by [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] against the Black Marvel Family. He is with [[Owen Mercer|Captain Boomerang (Owen Mercer)]], [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]],  [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]] and [[Electrocutioner]].<ref>52 Week 34</ref>

He appears "[[One Year Later]]" in the revamped ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' title as part of its regular cast as the White Queen's Knight under White Queen [[Amanda Waller]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> He is later seen capturing [[Rogues (comics)|the Rogues]] responsible for the murder of [[Bart Allen|the Flash]], alongside a new Suicide Squad composed of [[Bronze Tiger]], Captain Boomerang (Owen Mercer), Plastique, [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] and [[Deadshot]].

Even later, he would feature again as an operative of Waller's Suicide Squad, siding faithfully to her side in destroying a conspiracy to release a violent viral agent, working alongside fellow agent King Faraday. In this capacity, he would also duel against the Secret Six, and briefly take down Black Alice with his vertigo abilities.

During the events of 'Final Crisis', he is seen defeated as part of a Checkmate squad sent against the forces of [[Darkseid]] in [[Bludhaven]]. Seen with him is [[Negative Woman]] and members of the [[Atomic Knights]].<ref>''Final Crisis'' #4 (2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Being raised in a noble family, Vertigo was trained in classical martial [[combat]] and the sports of [[boxing]], [[fencing]], and [[equestrianism]]. He has also been trained in [[judo]] and general [[karate]].

Upon joining Task Force X and Checkmate, he learned other hand-to-hand combat skills.

His "Vertigo Effect" has long since been internalized through circumstances that have not yet been revealed. He uses his power to disrupt his enemies' balance. In hand-to-hand and melee combat, Vertigo uses his power to disorient his opponents. He also uses the Vertigo Effect to disrupt the aim of gunmen, snipers and the like. The exact range of the power is as of yet undetermined seeing as how on one mission{{Issue|date=April 2009}}, guards watching him in action on camera were also affected by his power. This ability is also capable of disrupting guidance systems on missiles, vehicles and detection systems of all kind (lasers, cameras, pressure sensitive floor plates, [[infra-red]], [[thermal energy|thermal]] and [[night vision]]). Count Vertigo also wears magnetic boots with which he can walk walls or ceilings. He also has in recent years gained the ability of flight.

==Other versions==
===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Vertigo lost his family from the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]/[[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] war. He volunteered to be part of the Resistance to rescue some circus members, [[Deadman|Boston Brand]], [[Dick Grayson]] and [[Rag Doll (Peter Merkel, Jr.)|Rag Doll]] for the Resistance. Vertigo then retrieves [[Doctor Fate]]'s Helm of Nabu from the Amazons' attacks.<ref>''Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Vertigo and the other circus members run at the countryside for reinforcements, but Vertigo is killed with an impaled spear. A dying Vertigo tells Dick to take the Helm and secure it.<ref>''Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:Vertigobatmantas.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vertigo as depicted on [[Batman: The Animated Series]].]]
* In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', Count Vertigo (referred to as '''Vertigo''' and voiced by [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]), was seen in the episode "[[Off Balance]]," where Batman has to escape with [[Talia al Ghul]] from his castle. He is defeated when Batman and Talia ring the castle's bells. The bells are so loud that Vertigo jumps off the tower into the river. The "Vertigo Effect" ability is utilized through an [[eye patch]] he wears.

[[File:TB vertigo.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Count Vertigo as depicted on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
* Count Vertigo appeared in the fifth season of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' played by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]. In this show, he is an ex-employee of Oliver Queen and a scientist. When he is fired, he uses his mechanical eye piece to set Oliver Queen off-balance while [[yacht]]ing and end up stranded on a deserted island for years. Some time later, Vertigo uses one of [[Wayne Enterprises]]' labs in order to build a [[gyroscope]] to cause guards at the mint to lose balance (which also affects children) only to be thwarted by Batman and [[Green Arrow]].

* Count Vertigo appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Revelation" voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. He is seen as the leader of the [[Injustice League]].

===Film===
* He is also reportedly featured in [[David S. Goyer]]'s script for an upcoming Green Arrow film project entitled ''[[Super Max]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latinoreview.com/news/supermax-green-arrow-story-details-villains-inmates-gallery-4673 |title=Supermax: Green Arrow Story Details + Villains/Inmates Gallery - Movie News - Latest Movie Reviews and trailers |publisher=Latinoreview.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref>

* Count Vertigo appears in the ''[[DC Showcase: Green Arrow]]'' animated short voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. In the film, he hires [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]] to assassinate Princess Perdita (Vertigo's niece and the heiress to the throne of Vlatava). After Merlyn is defeated by the Green Arrow, Count Vertigo steps in and attempts to kill both the Green Arrow and Perdita by using his vertigo attack. Before he could move in for the kill, Count Vertigo is defeated when [[Black Canary]] arrives and knocks him unconscious with her "Canary Cry".

==Ménière's disease==
During a fight with the [[Justice Society of America]], [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] suggested that the source of Count Vertigo's powers was a condition known as [[Ménière's disease]]. This condition causes constant vertigo in those afflicted and in some cases - such as that of Count Vertigo - deafness. Therefore, the hearing aid devices used by Vertigo to inflict his condition on others are necessary for him to be able to hear or maintain his balance, creating a weakness that his opponents can easily exploit.
