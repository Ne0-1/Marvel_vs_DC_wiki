'''Count Werner Vertigo''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]. First appearing in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #251 (July 1978), Count Vertigo is the last descendant of the royal family that ruled the small [[eastern European]] country of Vlatava, that would become devastated by [[the Spectre]], before being taken over by the [[Soviet]]s.  

==History==
===Starting his career===
Count Vertigo first appeared in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], where he attempted to steal back the family jewels his parents had sold when they escaped to [[England]] after the war. The victim of a hereditary inner [[ear]] defect that affected his balance, Vertigo had a small electronic device implanted in his right temple that compensated this problem. Tinkering with the device, Vertigo learned he was able to affect other people’s balance as well, distorting their perceptions so that they literally couldn’t tell up from down, an effect known as [[vertigo]]. This would bring him in conflict with the heroes [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]].

===Running with the Suicide Squad===
He would later come to join the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for a shortened prison sentence, and it was revealed that he was plagued by [[bipolar disorder]]. After the Suicide Squad disbanded for the first time, Count Vertigo was captured by Vlatavan rebels, who wished to use his powers to overthrow the current Vlatavan goverment. They used a variety of [[drugs]] on him, each with a differing effect on the Count, as he would for example suddenly see himself as an Angel of Vengeance, sent to wreak havoc on the current rulers. Although he largely believed himself master of his own will, his mood swings were completely suspect to his captors.

This ultimately led to him being captured by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] when the Suicide Squad came in and resolved the conflict and Kaligari (then-ruler of Vlatava) was murdered. Count Vertigo was used as a slave of Poison Ivy's for a long period of time, a time in which the Count grew to hate Poison Ivy and frequently threatened to kill her when he was free of her control. Amanda Waller was able to free Vertigo of her control so that he could stop a group of missiles hitting [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] at the behest of the villain [[Kobra (comics)]].

Vertigo succeeded, and it turned out that as he went into rehab and expunged the chemicals that had been pumped into his body by both Ivy and the rebels, that he was unwittingly cured of the manic depression that had plagued him for so long. This was something he found hard to deal with and he approached Deadshot, one of his teammates, hoping that Deadshot would be willing to end his life.

In the meantime, he was also approached by members of the Vlatavan government, who sought to see Count Vertigo reclaim his rightful place as ruler. He declined, stating that he wasn't fit to rule at this point, as he wasn't even sure if he wanted to live or die.

Although willing, [[Deadshot]] did give Vertigo the advice/warning to think it through, because Deadshot would not hesitate, and Vertigo had better be sure this is what he wanted. The running subplot would ultimately culminate in the last pages of the first volume of the Suicide Squad, in which Deadshot and Vertigo stood across one another, Deadshot ready to kill him. Count Vertigo realised that this was ultimately an indirect suicide, and that would ruin his chances for the afterlife. Deciding for now, that he would deal with the disease that now indirectly plagued him, the two men walked away from one another.

Vertigo also resolved his grudge with Poison Ivy. During the [[War of the Gods]] crossover, he was perfectly willing to let her die when he found her abandoned on an Amazonian island. Still, Ivy was saved, and Count Vertigo would later reluctantly work alongside her in the Suicide Squad, leaving their grudge be.

===Grudges and a new Injustice Society===
Working for the American government for a while, Count Vertigo eventually sought out his old enemy [[Green Arrow]] and after the two had a fight, Count Vertigo decided to leave the vendetta behind and focus on more positive prospects, getting his life back on track. Afterwards he showed up as a member of the new [[Injustice Society]]. He still maintains contact with various government agencies that employ metahumans. 

===The present===
Count Vertigo has recently been seen among [[Lex Luthor]]'s ranks in the [[Society of Supervillains]]. What role if any he will have in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' is to be seen.

==Powers and abilities==
His "Vertigo Effect" has long since been internalized somehow. It has never revealed the circumstances in which this had happened. His power is used to disrupt the balance of his enemies. In hand-to-hand and melee combat, Vertigo uses his power to disorient his opponents. He also uses the Effect to disrupt the aim of gunmen, snipers and the like. The exact range of the power is as of yet undeterminded seeing as how on one mission, guards watching him in action on camera were also affected by his power.

This odd ability is also capable of disrupting guidance systems on missles, vehicles and detection systems of all kind (lasers, cameras, pressure sensitive floor plates, infra-red, thermal and night vision). Count Vertigo also wears magnetic boots through which he can walk walls or ceilings. He also has the ability of flight.

==Other Media==
A character loosely based on Count Vertigo, simply called Vertigo, was seen in ''the Batman Animated Series'' where Batman has to escape with [[Talia]] from his castle.
