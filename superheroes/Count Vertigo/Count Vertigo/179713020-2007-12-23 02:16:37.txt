'''Count Werner Vertigo''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]. First appearing in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #251 (July [[1978]]), Count Vertigo is the last descendant of the royal family that ruled the small [[eastern European]] country of Vlatava, that was taken over by the [[Soviet]]s, and would later become devastated by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].  

==Character history==
===Starting his career===
Count Vertigo first appeared in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], where he attempted to steal back the jewels his parents had sold when they escaped to [[England]] after the war. The victim of a hereditary inner [[ear]] defect that affected his balance, Vertigo had a small electronic device implanted in his right temple that compensated this problem. Tinkering with the device, Vertigo learned he was able to affect other people’s balance as well, distorting their perceptions so that they literally couldn’t tell up from down, an effect known as [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]. This would bring him in conflict with the heroes [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]].

===Running with the Suicide Squad===
He would later come to join the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for a shortened prison sentence, and it was revealed that he was plagued by [[bipolar disorder]]. After the Suicide Squad disbanded for the first time, Count Vertigo was captured by Vlatavan rebels, who wished to use his powers to overthrow the current Vlatavan government. They used a variety of [[medication|drugs]] on him, each with a differing effect on the Count, as he would for example suddenly see himself as an Angel of Vengeance, sent to wreak havoc on the current rulers. Although he largely believed himself master of his own will, his mood swings were completely subject to his captors.

He was captured by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] when the Suicide Squad came in and resolved the conflict and Kaligari (then-ruler of Vlatava) was murdered. Count Vertigo was Poison Ivy's [[Slavery|slave]] for a long period of time, during which he grew to hate Poison Ivy and frequently threatened to kill her when he was free of her control. Amanda Waller was able to free Vertigo of her control so that he could stop a group of missiles hitting [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] at the behest of the villain [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]]. [[Image:VertigoCold.jpg|112px|thumb|left|Vertigo going cold turkey.]]
Vertigo succeeded, and it turned out that as he went into rehab and expunged the chemicals that had been pumped into his body by both Ivy and the rebels, that he was unwittingly cured of the disorder that had plagued him for so long. This was something he found hard to deal with and he approached [[Deadshot]], one of his teammates, hoping that Deadshot would be willing to end his life.

In the meantime, he was also approached by members of the Vlatavan government, who sought to see Count Vertigo reclaim his rightful place as ruler. He declined, stating that he wasn't fit to rule at this point, as he wasn't even sure if he wanted to live or die.

Although willing, Deadshot warned him to think it through, because Deadshot would not hesitate, and Vertigo had better be sure this is what he wanted. The running subplot would ultimately culminate in the last pages of the first volume of the Suicide Squad, in which Deadshot and Vertigo stood across one another, Deadshot ready to kill him. Count Vertigo realised that this was ultimately an indirect [[suicide]], and that would ruin his chances for the [[afterlife]]. Deciding for now that he would deal with the disease that now indirectly plagued him, he walked away from the duel.

Vertigo also resolved his grudge with Poison Ivy. During the [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]] crossover, he was perfectly willing to let her die when he found her abandoned on an Amazonian island. Still, Ivy was saved, and Count Vertigo would later reluctantly work alongside her in the Suicide Squad, leaving their grudge be.

===The destruction of Vlatava===
Ultimately, Count Vertigo did return to his homeland in order to ensure that he would once more become the country's rightful ruler. While his forces were at war with the government's army, the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] appeared, and already unhinged, was horrified by the slaughter that occurred. In a fit of rage he deemed the entire country and its inhabitants to be full of sin and decided to cleanse it, leaving behind only Vlatava's president at the time and Count Vertigo.

===Grudges and a new Injustice Society===
Working for the American government for a while, Count Vertigo eventually sought out his old enemy [[Green Arrow]] and after the two had a fight, Count Vertigo decided to leave the vendetta behind and focus on more positive prospects, getting his life back on track. Afterwards he showed up as a member of the new [[Injustice Society]]. He still maintains contact with various government agencies that employ metahumans. 

===''Infinite Crisis'' and One Year Later===
Count Vertigo has been seen among [[Lex Luthor]]'s ranks in the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. He appears "[[One Year Later]]" in the revamped ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' title as part of its regular cast as the White Queen's Knight under White Queen [[Amanda Waller]]. He is later seen capturing [[Rogues (comics)|the Rogues]] responsible for the murder of [[Bart Allen|the Flash]], alongside a new Suicide Squad comprised of [[Bronze Tiger]], [[Owen Mercer|Captain Boomerang (Owen Mercer)]], [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]], [[Multiplex (comics)|Multiplex]] and [[Deadshot]].

==Powers and abilities==
Being raised in a noble family, Vertigo was trained in [[classical]] martial [[combat]] and the sports of [[boxing]], [[fencing]], and [[equestrianism]]. He has also been trained in [[judo]] and general [[karate]].

Upon joining Task Force X and Checkmate, he learned other hand-to-hand combat skills.

His "Vertigo Effect" has long since been internalized through circumstances that have not yet been revealed. He uses his power to disrupt his enemies' balance. In hand-to-hand and melee combat, Vertigo uses his power to disorient his opponents. He also uses the Vertigo Effect to disrupt the aim of gunmen, snipers and the like. The exact range of the power is as of yet undetermined seeing as how on one mission, guards watching him in action on camera were also affected by his power. This odd ability is also capable of disrupting guidance systems on missiles, vehicles and detection systems of all kind (lasers, cameras, pressure sensitive floor plates, infra-red, thermal and night vision). Count Vertigo also wears magnetic boots with which he can walk walls or ceilings. He also has the ability of flight.

==Appearances in other media==
A character loosely based on Count Vertigo, simply called Vertigo (voiced by [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]), was seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in the episode "[[Off Balance]]," where Batman has to escape with [[Talia al Ghul]] from his castle. He is defeated when Talia rings the castle's bells. The bells are so loud that Vertigo jumped off the tower into the river, where he presumably died. The "Vertigo Effect" ability was utilized through an eye piece he wore.

The video for [[U2]]'s [[Vertigo (song)]] features the band standing in a gigantic white bullseye logo, the same as Count Vertigo's symbol on his costume.

[[Image:TB vertigo.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Count Vertigo as depicted on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Count Vertigo appeared in the fifth season of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. He was voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]. In this show, he was an employee of Oliver Queen until he was fired. This inspired him to use his mechanical eye piece to cause Oliver Queen to lose balance while [[yacht]]ing and end up stranded on a deserted island for years. Some time later, the madman used one of Wayne Enterprise's labs in order to build a gyroscope to cause guards at the mint to lose balance (which also affected kids)--only to be thwarted by Batman and Green Arrow. 

It's worthy to note that both interpretations featured a Vertigo effect that played on a particular sense: in  ''B:TAS'', it was '''visual'''; in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', it was '''auditory''', primarily affecting the [[inner ear]]. In both cases Batman disabled the afflicted sense (in the former, closing his [[eye]]s; in the latter, muffing his [[ear]]s) to counteract the effect.  On a side note, his henchmen wore high-tech headphones to make them immune to Count Vertigo's powers.

==Ménière's disease==
During a fight with the [[Justice Society of America]], [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] suggested that the source of Count Vertigo's powers was a condition known as [[Ménière's disease]]. This condition causes constant vertigo in those afflicted and in some cases - such as that of Count Vertigo - deafness. Therefore, the hearing aid devices used by Vertigo to inflict his condition on others are necessary for him to be able to hear or maintain his balance, creating a weakness that his opponents can easily exploit.
