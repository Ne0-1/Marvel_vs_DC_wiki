Upon hijacking some [[Iron Man's armors|Iron Man armors]], F.R.I.D.A.Y. kidnapped [[Pepper Potts]] as Iron Man tracked her to Stark Industries' Coney Island Facility. Upon Iron Man dispatching the controlled Iron Man armors and a hologram of [[Fin Fang Foom]], Iron Man reasoned with F.R.I.D.A.Y. as Pepper noted that F.R.I.D.A.Y. had a crush on Tony.
