'''Felicity Hardy''', also known as the second '''[[Scarlet Spider]]''', is a [[fictional character]] who appears in the [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[MC2]] series ''[[Spider-Girl]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Felicity Hardy was the daughter of [[Spider-Man]]'s former girlfriend (and crime fighting partner), Felicia Hardy (the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]) and his high school rival and friend, [[Flash Thompson]]. 

Felicia helped train her young daughter in [[gymnastics]] and [[martial arts]]. When Felicia left Flash for her lesbian girlfriend, Felicity took it hard, becoming resentful. Knowing Felicia would be furious if Felicity became a costumed hero (like her mother once was), Felicity sought out Spider-Girl, hoping that Spider-Girl would take her on as a sidekick. Wearing Spider-Girl's costume, Felicity confronted her hero to prove that she would make a great crimefighter, even revealing that she knew Spider-Girl's secret identity as May Parker. Spider-Girl, however, refused to take a non-powered teenager into battle.

Not dissuaded, Felicity began to look through old news reports involving Spider-Man, and came across an article that showed Spider-Man fighting crime alongside his [[Clone (genetics)|clone]], [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]]. She quickly created a Scarlet Spider costume and once again tried to be a hero.  Spider-Girl tried her best to prevent her, but Felicity repeatedly tried to help her, often putting her own life in danger.  Felicia found out what her daughter had done, and confronted her. Felicity asked her mother if she was angry because she became a hero, or because she hadn't patterned herself after the Black Cat.  However, after a near death experience fighting [[Kaine]], Felicity finally retired as the Scarlet Spider.  

But when Flash Thompson was about to lose his job as the basketball coach of Spider-Girl's high school, Felicity sought out her "mentor's" help once again, asking May to rejoin the basketball team. May refused, saying that using her powers on the basketball court was the same as cheating.  When she learned that the Cult of Scriers was out to kill Spider-Girl, Felicity became Scarlet Spider again to help her, but was almost killed by a Scrier. Felicity swore that she would hang up her mask, but it is likely that when given the opportunity, she will become Scarlet Spider again.  Felicity returned in Amazing Spider-Girl recently.

==Powers and abilities==
As Scarlet Spider, Felicity supplements her agility and fighting skills with "web-shooters" that can fire smoke bombs and sonic blasts (her "Scarlet Screamer"). Her primary weapon is a high-tech [[Cat o' nine tails]] whip (her "Scarlet O'Nine tails") that has extendable tendrils that can entangle her enemies like a web.  However, her greatest ability is her investigative skill.
