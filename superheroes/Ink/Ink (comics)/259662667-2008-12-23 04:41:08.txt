'''Ink''' ('''Eric Gitter''') is a [[comic book]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' main [[Shared universe|shared]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Marc Guggenheim]] and artist [[Yanick Paquette]], he first appeared in ''[[Young X-Men]]'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Ink is one of the founding members of the current team of the Young X-Men. He is a loud-mouthed and rude teenager with a criminal past(he could possibly be in the "crips" or have some affiliation with the gang, as he calls almost everyone "Cuz" or "Cuzin"). He is introduced when two police officers attempt to arrest him in a tattoo parlor. He fights back using his newly- acquired ability to make others violently ill with a touch, but is arrested anyway.

While Ink waits in jail, a prison guard releases him, in the process revealing himself to be Cyclops. In short order, Eric is recruited into Cyclops' junior X-Men team.
The teens are assembled in the Danger Cave, built by the former New X-Man, [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|David Alleyne]], where they train for their first mission: assassinating the original New Mutants.

Cyclops sends Ink and Blindfold to attack Dani Moonstar in her Colorado home, and after Blindfold knocks Moonstar unconscious, Ink knocks out Blindfold. He delivers her to [[Donald Pierce]], who refers to him as a mercenary. He also declares "whatever I am, I'm no killer".<ref>{{cite web|title= Exclusive Preview : Young X-Men #3|publisher= Marvel.com|date= 2008-05-29|url= http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3723.Exclusive_Preview~colon~_Young_X-Men_%233?utm_source=rss_new_news_feed&utm_medium=feed_link&utm_campaign=rss_feeds|accessdate=2008-05-30}}</ref>

He appears to suffer a crisis of conscience, however, and after Pierce's scheme comes to light, he leads the Young X-Men and New Mutants to Pierce's hideout. They subdue Pierce, but not before Wolf Cub is killed, leaving Ink to deal with his own feelings of guilt over his involvement.

Later, it is revealed that Ink is actually a normal human being, and that his tattoo artist is a mutant. Presumably, the tattoos he draws gave Ink his powers because Ink explained the functions of each tattoo prior to getting them. Emma Frost ran a scan on him at Dani Moonstar's request, and Pierce knew before he recruited him.

==Powers and abilities==
Ink has no powers of his own. Instead, he has access to a mutant with the power of granting superpowers to other beings by tatooing ''power symbols'' on them, evocative of the power he wants to bestow. For unknown reasons, he made Ink believe, or believes himself, that the tattoos merely draw upon the mutant potential of Ink himself. In so far Ink received on panels these tattoos and powers:

* He has a tattoo on his right palm in the shape of a [[biohazard]] symbol which gives him the power to make someone extremely ill.
* The tattoo on his left hand (as seen in the above image) gives him super strength. The lines look similar to the banding on Colossus' flesh when he transforms, indicating a toughening of Ink's flesh also.
* The two lightning bolt tattoos on his head give him the ability to read minds but can be blocked by psi-shields.
* The wings on his back grant him flight.
* The "Explosive" symbol tattooed on his right bicep allegedly "punched through a brick wall", though he hasn't used this ability on- panel yet.

Recently, an unknown character bearing the same "explosive" tattoo on his fist was seen orchestrating a prison break. This character's connection to Ink or his tattoo artist, if any, is unrevealed.
