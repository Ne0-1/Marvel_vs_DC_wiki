'''Lucy Lane''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC universe]]. She is the younger sister of [[Lois Lane]].

==History==
In the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was shown as having had a young niece named Susie Tompkins. Susie's main trait was telling [[tall tales]] to adults, and getting into various kinds of mischief. Susie's last appearance was in [[1955]]. While Lois' sister (and Susie's mother) was never shown in the Golden Age comics, after the advent of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the [[1960s]], later stories such as ''[[Action Comics]]'' #484 (from [[1978]]) presented Lucy as having had an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Two]] counterpart (a married woman named Lucille Tompkins), who was the mother of Susie.

Lucy Lane was first introduced in ''Superman's Pal [[Jimmy Olsen]]'' #36 in April [[1959]]. In the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] stories, Lucy was presented as an airline [[stewardess]] who was an on-again, off-again romantic interest of Jimmy Olsen. More so than her sister, Lucy carried a worldly, [[cosmopolitan]] attitude about her. Lucy's Silver Age appearances often revolved around Jimmy's various attempts at romancing her.

Lucy was reintroduced into current comics continuity in issue #5 of [[John Byrne]]'s [[1986]] miniseries ''[[Man of Steel]]''. Lucy was a flight attendant, but became affected by a mysterious blindness that was cured as a side-effect of the destruction of a [[Bizarro]] clone (loosely reflecting the first Pre-Crisis Bizarro story). Lucy returned to her job as a flight attendant and had a brief relationship with [[Jimmy Olsen]]. After many encounters with super-villains such as [[Deathstroke]], Sleeze and even becoming a vampire bride, she eventually started dating African-American ''[[Daily Planet]]'' staff member [[Ron Troupe]]. When Lucy became pregnant, her conservative father was enraged (although Lucy explained "There's not a racist bone in Daddy's body. He hates ''all'' his daughters' beaus.") [[Sam Lane]] eventually overcame his anger when Lucy and Ron were married and their child was born.

==Appearances in other media==
===Film===
Lucy Lane appears in the [[1984 in film|1984]] movie ''[[Supergirl (movie)|Supergirl]]'' as a friend and schoolmate of Supergirl's alter-ego Linda Lee. ''[[Fame (movie)|Fame]]'' actress [[Maureen Teefy]] portrayed her here as a peppy teen-ager with a burgeoning relationship with Jimmy Olsen (mimicking their relationship in the comics). 

===Animated television===
A young version of Lucy Lane appears in "Monkey Fun", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', where she is voiced by [[Aria Curzon]].  Lucy and her sister Lois are seen in a flashback playing with [[Titano the Super-Ape|Titano the monkey]] during their childhood.  Lucy as an adult is never explicitly identified in person.  She is mentioned by Lois while Clark is talking about his trouble with [[Mr. Mxyzptlk| Mr. Mxyzptlk's]] visits.  The Worlds Finest on Toonzone Online believe that a picture on Lois's bed stand is of Lucy.<ref> [http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/superman/bios/heroes/lucy/01.jpg]</ref>  The picture is quite small and her features are not very distinguishable, but the person in the picture has a body shape that is similar to Lois, with reddish hair even though in the flashback Lucy had black hair like Lois and blue eyes.<ref>[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/superman/bios/heroes/lucy/06.jpg].</ref>

Lucy Lane first appeared on the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' in the season four episode "Lucy"; she was played by [[Peyton List]].  In this version, Lucy has been attending school in Europe for some time, and has consequently been out of touch with her sister Lois. Lucy tells Lois and [[Clark Kent|Clark]] that she is on the run from a German [[loan shark]] named Macus Becker.  After initially trying to help her, Lois and Clark discover that Lucy is using their friendship with [[Lex Luthor]] to con him out of money to pay off her debt.  Lucy is resentful of her sister's relationship with their father, and was also using this opportunity to get some revenge on her.  Becker decides to hold the two sisters for ransom, but they are rescued when Clark intercepts the truck and stops it. Lucy sneaks away when Lex arrives with the police and speeds off in his Mercedes.  She is not seen again and is assumed to be [[On the lam|on the run]].<ref>[http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Lucy_Lane Lucy Lane entry at the Smallville Wiki]</ref>
