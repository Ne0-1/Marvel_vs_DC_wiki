Lucy Lane was created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[Curt Swan]]. She was introduced in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #36 (April 1959).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Otto Binder|Binder, Otto]]| penciller= [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]]| inker= [[John Giunta|Giunta, John]]| story= Lois Lane's Sister!| title= [[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]| issue= 36| date= April 1959}}</ref> In the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] stories, Lucy was presented as an airline [[stewardess]] who was an on-again, off-again romantic interest of [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Lucy's Silver Age appearances often revolved around Jimmy's various attempts at romancing her.  The character was believed to have died in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #120 (March 1972)<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]]; [[Irene Vartanoff|Vartanoff, Irene]] |penciller= [[Werner Roth (comics)|Roth, Werner]]|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= Who Killed Lucy Lane?|title= [[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]|issue= 120|date= March 1972}}</ref> but was later revived in a story in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #160 (October 1973).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Leo Dorfman|Dorfman, Leo]]| penciller= [[Kurt Schaffenberger|Schaffenberger, Kurt]]| inker= Schaffenberger, Kurt| story= The Shadow from the Grave| title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen| issue= 160| date= October 1973}}</ref>

Lucy was reintroduced into DC Comics' continuity in ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' #5 (December 1986). Lucy was an air traffic controller, but became affected by a mysterious blindness that was cured as a side-effect of the destruction of a [[Bizarro]] clone.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]| story= The Mirror, Crack'd...| title= [[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]|issue= 5| date= December 1986}}</ref> Lucy returned to her job and had a brief relationship with [[Jimmy Olsen]]. After many encounters with super-villains such as [[Sleez]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]]| penciller= Jurgens, Dan| inker= [[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]]| story= Sleaze Factor|title= [[Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]|issue= 475|date= February 1991}}</ref> [[Deathstroke]],<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Jurgens, Dan| penciller= Jurgens, Dan| inker= [[Brett Breeding|Breeding, Brett]]|story= Sins of the Father|title= [[Superman vol. 2|Superman]]|volume= 2 |issue= 68|date= June 1992}}</ref> and even becoming a vampire bride,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Louise Simonson|Simonson, Louise]]| penciller= [[Jon Bogdanove|Bogdanove, Jon]]|inker= [[Dennis Janke|Janke, Dennis]]| story= Night Moves|title= [[Superman: The Man of Steel]]|issue= 14|date= August 1992}}</ref> she eventually started dating African-American ''[[Daily Planet]]'' staff member [[Ron Troupe]]. When Lucy became pregnant, her conservative father was enraged although Lucy explained "There's not a racist bone in Daddy's body. He hates ''all'' his daughters' beaus." [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]] eventually overcame his anger when Lucy and Ron were married and their child was born.

===New Krypton===
After a long disappearance from the principal storylines, Lucy Lane returns in the one shot ''Superman: New Krypton''. Her past with [[Ron Troupe]] is unclear, they are possibly estranged (Troupe having resurfaced in the current storylines, working again with the Daily Planet). Her long disappearance is explained by her joining the military, in a desperate, post-mortem attempt to appease her (presumed) dead father's desire to have a son able to carry on his career in the military. Bitter and angrier than in her former appearances, she still blames Lois for General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane's]] apparent death during the [[Our Worlds at War|war against Imperiex]]. Essentially, she thinks Lois broke his heart by putting her love for [[Superman]] before her duties as a daughter.

Lucy references her former appearances, even mentioning her "dating boys in Lois' circle" as failed attempts to live her life through her more successful sister, but she eventually chooses to sacrifice her life and live the military career her father intended for Lois, driving an even deeper wedge between the two sisters. Unbeknownst to her, their father is still alive, and working with the government.

===Superwoman===
[[File:Superwoman.png|thumb|right|Lucy Lane as Superwoman. Art by [[Joshua Middleton]].]]
Lucy first appeared as Superwoman in ''[[Supergirl]]'' #35, her costume a nod to that of the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] Superwoman [[Kristin Wells]] and containing a containment field that simulated Kryptonian powers. Lucy's identity was not revealed until near the story arc's end. During her tenure as Superwoman, she was ordered by her father, General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], to kill [[Agent Liberty]], who had been spying on General Lane and Lex Luthor.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]| penciller= [[Pete Woods|Woods, Pete]]; [[Renato Guedes|Guedes, Renato]]|inker= Woods, Pete; [[Jose Wilson Magalhaés|Magalhaés, Jose Wilson]]|story= New Krypton Part 10: Birth of a Nation|title= [[Action Comics]]|issue= 873|date= March 2009}}</ref> She later attacked [[Reactron]], which tipped off readers that Superwoman was not Kryptonian (in that the villain's Gold Kryptonite power source had no effect on her.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Sterling Gates|Gates, Sterling]]|penciller= [[Jamal Igle|Igle, Jamal]]| inker= [[Keith Champagne|Champagne, Keith]]|story= Who is Superwoman?

In ''Supergirl Annual'' #1 readers are given the current modern backstory of Lucy Lane. In the story, Lucy, since the moment she was born, has felt overshadowed by her big sister Lois. Lucy always felt that Lois outperformed her, overshadowed her and was more loved by their father. Lucy never blames Lois but she blames her parents Sam and Ella. Feeling that by maybe being closer to Lois her father would pay more attention to her, Lucy moved to the same city but this came at the same time Lois and her father grew apart over Superman. After her father's death, Lucy joined the army. Being a great soldier and a woman, Lucy rose quickly in the ranks. During the [[Amazons Attack!|Amazon attack]] on the United States, Lucy was nearly killed by two Amazons but was saved by [[Codename: Assassin]]. Awaking in Project 7734, her father is able to convince Lucy to put on the Superwoman suit, which possessed mystical qualities.

Although seemingly dead, Lucy's remains steal the lifeforce of a man who came too close.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gates, Sterling|penciller= Dagnino, Fernando|inker= Fernandez, Raul|story= Second Born: The Secret Origin of Superwoman|title= Supergirl Annual| volume= 2|issue= 1|date= November 2009}}</ref> When Lucy is recovered by General Lane's forces, they learn that the suit's mystic energies have somehow transformed her into an actual Kryptonian.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gates, Sterling|penciller= Igle, Jamal| inker= Sibal, Jon; [[Mark McKenna|McKenna, Mark]]|story= Queen|title= Supergirl|volume= 5|issue= 50|date= April 2010}}</ref>

Following the ''[[Superman: War of the Supermen|War of the Supermen]]'' storyline, Lucy is in custody in S.T.A.R. Labs by [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]] and [[Gangbuster]], who are attempting to remove Lucy's metahuman abilities. After interference by an object that crashes into a Metropolis park, before they leave Lucy's holding cell, it is shown seemingly to have lightly cracked.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gates, Sterling|penciller= Igle, Jamal|inker= Sibal, Jon|story= Fallout|title= Supergirl|volume= 5|issue= 53|date= August 2010}}</ref> Later, Lucy is visited by her sister Lois, who wants to talk. Lucy is unhelpful as she has completely given in to insanity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gates, Sterling| penciller= Igle, Jamal| inker= Sibal, Jon| story= Day of the Dollmaker, Part One: Toying With Emotions| title= Supergirl| volume= 5| issue= 58| date= January 2011}}</ref> Lois tells Lucy that she is disgusted by her and walks away leaving Lucy in S.T.A.R. Labs custody behind.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Gates, Sterling| penciller= Igle, Jamal| inker= Sibal, Jon; [[Robin Riggs|Riggs, Robin]]| story= Day of the Dollmaker, Part Two: End of the Line| title= Supergirl| volume= 5| issue= 59| date= February 2011}}</ref> Although the crack in the cell seemed to hint at Lucy escaping at some point, nothing came of it, and once [[The New 52]] was launched, all storylines in progress in DC were dropped in favor of the new continuity.

===The New 52=== 
In [[The New 52]], a reboot of the DC Comics universe, Lucy Lane is first seen where she was picked up from the train station by Lois after Clark Kent was unable to fulfill his promise to Lois to do it himself.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]; Jurgens, Dan|penciller= Jurgens, Dan|inker= [[Jesus Merino|Merino, Jesus]]|story= To Hel and Back|title= Superman|volume= 3|issue= 7|date= May 2012}}</ref> Later to make up for it, Clark accompanies her, Lois, Johnathan Carrol, and Morgan Edge to the most expensive restaurant in town but is later forced to leave her with the check due to his duties as Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Jurgens, Dan|penciller= Jurgens, Dan|inker=  Merino, Jesus; [[Vicente Cifuentes|Cifuentes, Vicente]]; [[Rob Hunter|Hunter, Rob]]|story= Combat|title= Superman|volume= 3|issue= 11|date= September 2012}}</ref> Clark later makes it up to her by taking her bungee jumping, an activity which Lucy enjoys.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Jurgens, Dan|penciller= Jurgens, Dan|inker= McCarthy, Ray|story= Home|title= Superman|volume= 3|issue= 12|date= October 2012}}</ref> Lucy befriended and later became roommates with Olivia after they met while [[white water rafting]]. They also adopted a cat named Simon. Olivia became ill and Doctor Obeshian gave her drugs to take, the drugs having secretly been taken from an alien fungus which would mutate the user into a shapeshifting creature. Lucy and Olivia both took the pills resulting in the former turning into a wolf like creature and the latter into a giant insect-like creature. An organization named the Cartel began kidnapping users of the drug, which had begun circulating on the streets, for detox and they managed to capture Olivia. Lucy convinced Lois to save Olivia. In her insect form Lucy rescued Lois and Olivia from the Cartel's base. The issue ended with Lois comforting a hysterical Lucy.

==Powers and abilities==
Although Superwoman originally had no inherent powers, her powersuit altered her DNA via a containment field to resemble that of a Kryptonian and as such would potentially make her capable of all the same feats they possess under the yellow sun.
The abilities she has used thus far are: Vast superhuman strength, speed and durability, invulnerability, flight (normal and interstellar), freeze breath and heat vision. The powersuit protects her from the harmful effects of Kryptonite and grants her the ability to steal the life of someone nearby to resurrect herself.
Any other non-Kryptonian abilities the suit may possess have yet to be revealed. Due to the launch of the New 52, it is unlikely that any of the suit's other powers will be revealed unless it makes an appearance in the new continuity.

As a result of her resurrection in ''Supergirl'' #50, she is said to have all the inherent abilities and weaknesses of 'Those alien races' which were duplicated by the suit as the result of her return from the dead. While the exact number of alien races whose powers are duplicated by the suit are unknown, Kryptonian powers are among the powerset, as she displayed the ability to use Heat Vision shortly after her recovery by Sam Lane's forces when she was reborn. She confirms that she possesses super hearing when she murders a scientist working for Lane, though she does so with some form of energy blast from her hand, a power that is not among the abilities of a Kryptonian. If this statement is accurate, Lucy Lane now shares the inherent weakness to Kryptonite which all Kryptonians possess.

The original suit was destroyed by Supergirl but she appears to have acquired another as of ''Supergirl'' #50, and it is unknown if this suit is the same as the one she had been using to masquerade as a Kryptonian, or a non-magical one.

After her mutation due to drugs created from an alien fungus Lucy can transform from her mutated form to her normal form. In her mutated form Lucy can fly and apparently withstand tranquilizer darts.

==In other media==

===Television===
* A young version of Lucy Lane appears in "Monkey Fun", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Aria Noelle Curzon]]. Lucy and her sister Lois are seen in a flashback playing with [[Titano the Super-Ape|Titano the monkey]] during their childhood. Lucy as an adult is never explicitly identified in person.

[[Image:Lane sis.jpg|thumb|right|Lucy and Lois in ''[[Smallville]]''.]]
* Lucy Lane first appeared on the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' in the season four episode "Lucy"; she was played by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1986)|Peyton List]]. In this version, Lucy has been attending school in Europe for some time, and has consequently been out of touch with her sister Lois. Lucy is briefly mentioned in the episode "Persuasion" when Lois (under the effects of Jewel Kryptonite crystals that cause Clark to unintentionally influence anyone who hears his words to obey him) believes she is marrying Clark and calls Lucy to tell her she's getting married. Lucy appears in season 10's seventh episode, as she surprises Lois along with General Sam Lane when they arrive on the Kent farm before Thanksgiving.

[[File:Jenna_Dewan_Tatum_as_Lucy_Lane_in_"Supergirl".jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jenna Dewan Tatum]] as Lucy Lane in the [[CBS]] TV series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.]]

===Film===
* Lucy Lane appears in the 1984 movie ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]'' as a friend and schoolmate of Supergirl's alter-ego Linda Lee. ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' actress [[Maureen Teefy]] portrayed her here as a peppy teenager with a burgeoning relationship with Jimmy Olsen mimicking their relationship in the comics.
* In ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'', she is mentioned (not by name) by Lois Lane right before Superman makes his first public appearance. Here she is said to have three kids, two cats and a mortgage making it inconsistent with Lucy's later appearance, in the ''Supergirl'' movie (which is set in the same continuity), where she is still a teenager. As no name is given, it's possible that Lois has a second sister in the film continuity (in the comics Lucy is her only sibling).
