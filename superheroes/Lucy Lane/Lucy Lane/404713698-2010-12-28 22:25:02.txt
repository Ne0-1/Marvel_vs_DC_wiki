==Fictional character biography==
In the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was shown as having had a young niece named Susie Tompkins. Susie's main trait was telling [[tall tales]] to adults, and getting into various kinds of mischief. Susie's last appearance was in 1955. While Lois' sister (and Susie's mother) was never shown in the Golden Age comics, after the advent of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, later stories such as ''[[Action Comics]]'' #484 (from 1978) presented Lucy as having had an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Two]] counterpart (a married woman named Lucille Tompkins), who was the mother of Susie.

Lucy Lane was first introduced in ''Superman's Pal [[Jimmy Olsen]]'' #36 in April 1959. In the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] stories, Lucy was presented as an airline [[stewardess]] who was an on-again, off-again romantic interest of Jimmy Olsen. More so than her sister, Lucy carried a worldly, [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] attitude about her. Lucy's Silver Age appearances often revolved around Jimmy's various attempts at romancing her.

Lucy was reintroduced into current comics continuity in issue #5 of [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]''. Lucy was an air traffic controller, but became affected by a mysterious blindness that was cured as a side-effect of the destruction of a [[Bizarro]] clone (loosely reflecting the first Pre-Crisis Bizarro story). Lucy returned to her job and had a brief relationship with [[Jimmy Olsen]]. After many encounters with super-villains such as [[Deathstroke]], [[Sleez]] and even becoming a vampire bride, she eventually started dating African-American ''[[Daily Planet]]'' staff member [[Ron Troupe]]. When Lucy became pregnant, her conservative father was enraged (although Lucy explained "There's not a racist bone in Daddy's body. He hates ''all'' his daughters' beaus.") [[Sam Lane]] eventually overcame his anger when Lucy and Ron were married and their child was born.

===New Krypton===
After a long disappearance from the principal storylines, Lucy Lane returns in the one shot ''Superman: New Krypton''. Her past with [[Ron Troupe]] is unclear, they are possibly estranged (Troupe having resurfaced in the current storylines, working again with the Daily Planet). Her long disappearance is explained by her joining the military, in a desperate, post-mortem attempt to appease her (presumed) dead father's desire to have a son able to carry on his career in the military. Bitter and angrier than in her former appearances, she still blames Lois for General [[Sam Lane]]'s apparent death during the [[Our Worlds at War|war against Imperiex]]. Essentially, she thinks Lois broke his heart by putting her love for [[Superman]] before her duties as a daughter.

Lucy references her former appearances, even mentioning her "dating boys in Lois' circle" as failed attempts to live her life through her more successful sister, but she eventually chooses to sacrifice her life and live the military career her father intended for Lois, driving an even deeper wedge between the two sisters. However, unbeknownst to her, their father is still alive, and working with the government.

Lucy's marriage to Ron Troupe, and the birth of their child Samuel Troupe, may still be in continuity, as a photograph of Sam Troupe appears on Ron's desk.<ref>Action Comics Annual #11</ref>

===Superwoman===
[[File:Superwoman.png|thumb|right|200px|Lucy Lane as Superwoman. Art by [[Joshua Middleton]].]]
Lucy first appeared as Superwoman in ''[[Supergirl]]'' #35, her costume a nod to that of the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]] Superwoman [[Kristin Wells]] and containing a containment field that simulated Kryptonian powers. However, Lucy's identity was not revealed until near the story arc's end. During her tenure as Superwoman, she was ordered by her father, General [[Sam Lane]], to kill [[Agent Liberty]], who had been spying on General Lane and Lex Luthor.<ref>''Action Comics'' #873</ref>  (This resulted in her being the focus of the ''Supergirl'' [[Faces of Evil]] issue.)  She later attacked [[Reactron]], which tipped off readers that Superwoman was not Kryptonian (in that the villain's Gold Kryptonite power source had no effect on her<ref>''Supergirl'' #38</ref>). Supergirl unmasks Superwoman,<ref>''Supergirl'' #40</ref> and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit, causing Lucy's body to contort and explode.<ref>''Supergirl'' #41</ref>

In the ''Supergirl Annual'' #1 reveals the current modern backstory of Lucy Lane. In the story, Lucy, since the moment she was born, has felt overshadowed by her big sister Lois. Lucy always felt that Lois outperformed her, overshadowed her and was more loved by their father. Lucy never blames Lois but she blames her parents Sam and Ella. Feeling that by maybe being closer to Lois her father would pay more attention to her, Lucy moved to the same city but this came at the same time Lois and her father grew apart over Superman. After her father's death, Lucy joined the army. Being a great soldier and a woman, Lucy rose quickly in the ranks. During the [[Amazons Attack!|Amazon attack]] on the United States, Lucy was nearly killed by two Amazons but was saved by [[Codename: Assassin]]. Awaking in Project 7734, her father is able to convince Lucy to put on the Superwoman suit, which possessed mystical qualities. 

Although seemingly dead, Lucy's remains steal the lifeforce of a man(Steven Morrow) who comes too close to them.<ref>''Supergirl Annual'' #1 (September 2009)</ref> When Lucy is recovered by General Lane's forces, they learn that the suit's mystic energies have somehow transformed her into an actual Kryptonian.<ref>''Supergirl'' (Vol. 5)#50(February 2010)</ref>

After the ''[[Superman: War of the Supermen|War of the Supermen]]'' storyline, Lucy is in custody in S.T.A.R. Labs by [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]] and [[Gangbuster]], who are attempting to remove Lucy's metahuman abilities. After interference by an object that crashes into a Metropolis park, before they leave, Lucy's holding cell starts to crack.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #53 (June 2010)</ref> Later, Lucy is visited by her sister Lois, who wants to talk. Lucy is unhelpful as she has completely given in to insanity.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #58 (November 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Although Superwoman has no inherent powers, her powersuit alters her DNA (via a containment field) to resemble that of a Kryptonian and as such would potentially make her capable of all the same feats they possess under the yellow sun. 
The abilities she has used thus far are: Vast superhuman strength, speed and durability, invulnerability, flight (normal and interstellar), freeze breath and heat vision. The powersuit also protects her from the harmful affects of Kryptonite and grants her the ability to steal the life of someone nearby to resurrect herself. 
Any other non-Kryptonian abilities the suit may possess have yet to be revealed.

As a result of her resurrection in issue fifty of Supergirl, she is said to have all the inherent abilities and weaknesses of 'Those alien races' which were duplicated by the suit as the result of her return from the dead. While the exact number of alien races whose powers are duplicated by the suit are unknown, Kryptonian powers are among the powerset, as she displayed the ability to use Heat Vision shortly after her recovery by Sam Lane's forces when she was reborn. She also confirms that she possesses super hearing when she murders a scientist working for Lane, though she does so with some form of energy blast from her hand, a power that is not among the abilities of a Kryptonian. If this statement is accurate, Lucy Lane now shares the inherent weakness to Kryptonite which all Kryptonians possess.

The original suit was destroyed by Supergirl, however she appears to have acquired another as of issue fifty of Supergirl, and it is currently unknown if this suit is the same as the one she had been using to masquerade as a Kryptonian, or a non-magical one.

==In other media==
===Film===
Lucy Lane appears in the [[1984 in film|1984]] movie ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]'' as a friend and schoolmate of Supergirl's alter-ego Linda Lee. ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' actress [[Maureen Teefy]] portrayed her here as a peppy teen-ager with a burgeoning relationship with Jimmy Olsen (mimicking their relationship in the comics). In ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'', she is mentioned by Lois Lane right before Superman makes his first public appearance.

===Animated television===
A young version of Lucy Lane appears in "Monkey Fun", an episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', where she is voiced by [[Aria Curzon]]. Lucy and her sister Lois are seen in a flashback playing with [[Titano the Super-Ape|Titano the monkey]] during their childhood.  Lucy as an adult is never explicitly identified in person.  She is mentioned by Lois while Clark is talking about his trouble with [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]]'s visits. The Worlds Finest on Toonzone Online believe that a picture on Lois's bed stand is of Lucy.<ref>http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/superman/bios/heroes/lucy/01.jpg</ref> The picture is quite small and her features are not very distinguishable, but the person in the picture has a body shape that is similar to Lois, with reddish hair even though in the flashback Lucy had black hair like Lois and blue eyes.<ref>[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/superman/bios/heroes/lucy/06.jpg].</ref>

===Animated shorts===
[[Lewis Klahr]] used the character of Lucy Lane along with Jimmy Olsen in his 1998 animated short [[The Pony Glass]], which was constructed using cut out shapes from comic books.

===Live action television===
====''Lois & Clark''====
Lucy Lane appeared in three episodes of the television show ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'', where she was portrayed by [[Elizabeth Barondes]] and one episode where she was portrayed by [[Roxana Zal]].

====''Smallville''====
[[Image:Lane sis.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Lane sisters, Lucy and Lois, in the series ''[[Smallville]]'']]
Lucy Lane first appeared on the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' in the season four episode "Lucy"; she was played by [[Peyton List]]. In this version, Lucy has been attending school in Europe for some time, and has consequently been out of touch with her sister Lois. Lucy tells Lois and Clark that she is on the run from a German [[loan shark]] named Marcus Becker. After initially trying to help her, Lois and Clark discover that Lucy is using their friendship with [[Lex Luthor]] to con him out of money to pay off her debt.  Lucy is resentful of her sister's relationship with their father, and was also using this opportunity to get some revenge on her.  Becker decides to hold the two sisters for ransom, but they are rescued when Clark intercepts the truck and stops it. Lucy sneaks away when Lex arrives with the police and speeds off in his [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]]. She is not seen again and is at one point thought to be in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]], [[Germany]].  She is also briefly mentioned in the episode "Persuasion" when Lois (under the effects of Jewel Kryptonite crystals) believes she is marrying Clark and calls Lucy to tell her she's getting married. Lucy appears in season 10's seventh episode, as she surprises Lois along with General Sam Lane when they arrive on the Kent farm before Thanksgiving. Her troublemaker personality has not lessened since season four, and she stirs up some waves in Lois and Clark's relationship, as both Sam and her tests Lois' feelings for Clark. As she's close to the General, Rick Flag of the Suicide Squad tries to get to the General through his youngest daughter, but once again Clark saves the day. Lois and Lucy makes up, and all is well on the Kent farm as they enjoy a family thanksgiving dinner.
