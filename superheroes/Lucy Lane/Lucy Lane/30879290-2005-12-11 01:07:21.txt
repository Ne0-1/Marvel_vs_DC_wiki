'''Lucy Lane''' is a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She is the younger sister of [[Lois Lane]].

==History==
In the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] comics, Lois was shown as having had a young niece named Susie Tompkins. Susie's main trait was telling [[tall tales]] to adults, and getting into various kinds of mischief. Susie's last appearance was in [[1955]]. While Lois' sister (and Susie's mother) was never shown in the Golden Age comics, after the advent of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the [[1960s]], later stories such as ''[[Action Comics]]'' #484 (from [[1978]]) presented Lucy as having had an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Two]] counterpart (a married woman named Lucille Tompkins), who was the mother of Susie.

Lucy Lane was first introduced in ''Superman's Pal [[Jimmy Olsen]]'' #36 in [[April]] [[1959]]. In the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] stories, Lucy was presented as an airline [[stewardess]] who was an on-again, off-again romantic interest of Jimmy Olsen. More so than her sister, Lucy carried a worldly, [[cosmopolitan]] attitude about her. Lucy's Silver Age appearances often revolved around Jimmy's various attempts at romancing her.

Lucy was reintroduced into current comics continuity in issue #5 of [[John Byrne]]'s [[1986]] miniseries ''[[Man of Steel]]''. Lucy was a flight attendant, but became affected by a mysterious blindness that was cured as a side-effect of the destruction of a [[Bizarro]] clone. Lucy returned to her job as a flight attendant and had a brief relationship with [[Jimmy Olsen]]. After many encounters with super-villains such as [[Deathstroke]] and Sleez, she eventually started dating African-American ''[[Daily Planet]]'' staff member [[Ron Troupe]]. When Lucy became pregnant, her conservative parents were enraged, but they eventually overcame their anger and racism when Lucy and Ron's child was born.

==Other Media==
Though a minor character in the Superman mythos, Lucy Lane has made several live action appearances in the various Superman projects. She was first seen in the 1984 movie ''[[Supergirl (movie)|Supergirl]]'' as Supergirl's friend and schoolmate. ''Fame'' actress [[Maureen Teefy]] portrayed her here as a peppy teen-ager.  She also made three appearances on the television show ''[[Lois and Clark]]'', where she was portrayed by both [[Elizabeth Barondes]] and [[Roxanna Zal]].  In 2005, she showed up in ''[[Smallville (television series)|Smallville]]'', played by [[Peyton List]].
