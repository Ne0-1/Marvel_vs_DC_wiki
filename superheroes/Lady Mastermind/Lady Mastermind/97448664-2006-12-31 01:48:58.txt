'''Lady Mastermind''' ('''Regan Wyngarde''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #006 ([[December 2001]]) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Salvador Larroca]].

==Character biography==
Lady Mastermind is one of two daughters of [[Jason Wyngarde]], the original Mastermind. She has an intense hatred for her half-sister, [[Martinique Jason|Martinique]]. She was originally involved in a plot created by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] to have his revenge against [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]] and gain control of the [[Sydney]] underworld.

In an attempt to make Tessa work for Shaw again, Lady Mastermind placed her in a series of [[illusion]]s. However, with the assistance of [[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] was able to break the illusion and reflect Regan's powers back against her, leaving her in a [[vegetative state]].

Regan is one of few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. In ''[[X-Men]]'' (2nd series) #188, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] find a comatose Regan, along with a partially disassembled [[Karima Shapandar]]. It was stated that Regan fell victim to scientists of the Fordyce Clinc who were trying to determine if a person can catch mutation like a disease.

Regan finally awakened from her coma after her powers had been temporarily hijacked by [[Serafina]].  She is now part of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s strike force/field team but Rogue recently told Regan that she is only  staying with the team until they defeat their newest enemy and than she is only wearing the X-men uniform beacuse she was found with nothing more then a white sheet.

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Mastermind possess the mutant power to project extremely convincing and realistic illusions into the minds of others, the same ability her father had.

Her illusions are hypnotic, and her victims tend to accept them as fact, even when the images and scenarios they are confronted with involve sudden changes to the world around them, or are inconsistent or improbable (for example, Rogue, when under Lady Mastermind's control did not question the sudden existence of a multitude of [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]]es, or the random jumps in location and time she was experiencing).

As such they can be used as a very effective [[brainwashing]] tool.

Regan's powers can also kill, as her victims bodies respond as if her illusions are real. She confronted Viceroy with the illusion that he was drowning, and believing it to be real, he suffocated, despite having no physical injuries and being in a room with sufficient oxygen. Heather Cameron's body also responded in a similar way, bleeding through the pores in her back when she was under the illusion she had been stabbed.

In addition, unlike her father, both Regan and her half-sister Martinique have limited telepathic abilities that enable them to read their foes minds and make their illusions all the more accurate for it.

Regan's illusions have also been shown to persist even after she has been rendered unconscious.

She also carries two handguns in the belt of her X-men uniform
==Trivia==
Regan is responsible for the murder of Heather ([[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]]) and Davis Cameron's ([[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]]) father, Miles Warbeck (the mob boss known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]]).
