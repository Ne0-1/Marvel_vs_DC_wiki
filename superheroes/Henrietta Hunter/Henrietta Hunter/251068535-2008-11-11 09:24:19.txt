In ''X-Statix'' #13, [[Peter Milligan]] had planned to use [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] in a storyline which featured her returning from the dead as a mutant superhero. News of this leaked out to the media and there followed a series of objections, most notably from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[tabloid]] [[newspaper]] ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]''.
Quesada and Marvel announced that they would alter the character of Princess Diana, replacing her with a fictional pop star, Henrietta Hunter (still physically resembling Diana, but with black hair and a different hairdo).[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/henriettahunter.htm#comments]

==Fictional character biography==
When Henrietta Hunter was a young girl, she dreamed of becoming famous. As she grew up, she became Europa’s hottest young [[Celebrity|pop star]], until she was electrocuted and killed by a microphone that someone had sabotaged. 

Henrietta’s ghostly spirit returned to Hawthorne House, the ancestral home of the Hunters. Her spirit levitated towards her body and re-possessed it, resurrecting her with a happy “ta-da!” X-Statix eventually arrived and saved her from the Europan government agents, who had recently arrived to make sure Henrietta stayed dead. Upon saving her, X-Statix returned to their HQ in [[Santa Monica, California]], where Henrietta revealed that she was a mutant, gifted with empathy.

Soon after her return, she appeared on “[[Lacuna (comics)|Lacuna]] & the Stars” to announce her comeback. After her show, Henrietta met with [[Spike Freeman]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] to discuss the merchandising of her name, where she was attacked by an assassin hired by Europan agents Dicky and Reggie. The assassin’s plot was foiled by [[Doop (comics)|Doop]] and Spike Freeman then announced on television that Henrietta was joining X-Statix. To announce her membership, X-Statix appeared in New York with a red carpet arrival. While in [[New York City]], Henrietta was attacked and kidnapped by the '''Euro-Trash''', a group made up entirely of national [[stereotype]]s. 

Euro-Trash retreated to an X-Statix Store in New York, while X-Statix fought with themselves over whether or not to save her. They eventually decided to save her and they teleported inside the store and killed all the members of Euro-Trash. After saving Henrietta, X-Statix held a press conference, where Henrietta revealed many of her charitable ideas. Later, Henrietta visited young Jesus Diaz at the hospital, whose legs had been amputated due to a landmine. Upon seeing her charitable spree (with their money), X-Statix decided that they must kill her. 

Henrietta relaxed aboard a yacht, when X-Statix appeared. Lacuna tagged along on [[Venus Dee Milo]]’s teleportational coattails and warned Henrietta that they were there to kill her. She then convinced X-Statix to rethink the idea of killing Henrietta and they decided against it. Henrietta later joined X-Statix on a mission to [[Afghanistan]], where she took out several members of a [[Taliban]] sect. When they returned to Santa Monica, X-Statix held a press conference, where Henrietta was announced the new team leader and United States Secretary of [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Defense]].

After a modeling shoot involving her designs, Henrietta led X-Statix on a wild goose chase in an attempt to locate '''Mister Code''', a mastermind responsible for various random [[sniper]] killings. Not having any luck finding him, Henrietta returned to the X-Statix HQ and used her abilities to communicate with ghostly spirits to aid her in throwing a dart to Mister Code’s location on a giant map of the [[United States]]. As she asked for help from the spirits, [[Dead Girl]] also spoke with the deceased in an attempt to throw Henrietta off course and further ruin Ms. Hunter’s image. When Henrietta appeared on television, she was pelted with fruit and other trash, due to her faltering public image associated with her failure to locate the random killer. 

Henrietta led X-Statix as they broke into Lacuna’s lawyers’ offices to retrieve the incriminating evidence against them. Unfortunately, her lawyer had turned the evidence over to the press, ruining X-Statix’s image. In order to fix their image, X-Statix decided that they had to stop Mister Code. Determining his location thanks to Dead Girl communicating with Spike Freeman’s corpse, Venus teleported X-Statix into battle against Mister Code. Mister Code breaks Hunter's neck. He is slain by [[Mister Sensitive|Orphan]]. Code's body explodes, killing  [[Phat (comics)|Phat]].

After Henrietta’s second death, her record company releases a single entitled “''Back from the Dead''". The tune mysteriously kills anyone who sang the song aloud. Following the funeral of X-Statix member [[Phat (comics)|Phat]], another X-Statix member, [[El Guapo (comics)|El Guapo]], sings the song. He believes it is safe to do so since the record producer who had released the single had died from the curse himself. This is proven false when Hunter scares him into being impaled on his own board. 

In order to get to the bottom of the deaths caused by Henrietta’s single, X-Statix has Dead Girl sing the song. Phat's foot, having been blown off during the fight with Code, shatters her head, a temporary setback. After speaking a bit with Henrietta’s corpse, Dead Girl discovers that Henrietta was taking her revenge on those who wanted her dead by killing any who sung her song aloud. X-Statix travels Europe, tracking down those who wanted Hunter dead. They use the song to kill the head conspirators.

==Powers and abilities==
She was a mutant with empathic powers, the ability to read and feel the emotions of others. She could sense the pain of others. 
After the first time she returned from the dead, she not only regained her empathic abilities, but also increased athletic prowess and the ability to communicate with ghostly spirits. 
Following her second death, Henrietta once again returned in a zombie-like form. In this form, she, like other [[zombie]]s, did not appear to require food or oxygen to survive. She also appeared to be able to cause unlikely events to happen that would cause death to those who sung her song. It is unknown whether she retained any of her previous powers, as she did not display any as a corpse.
