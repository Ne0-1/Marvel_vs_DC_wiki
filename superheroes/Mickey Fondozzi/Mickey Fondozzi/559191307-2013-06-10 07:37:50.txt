'''Mickey Fondozzi''' is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] character and an ally of the [[Punisher]].  

==Fictional character history==
Before he encounters the Punisher, Mickey is working for the Carbone crime family. They believe that he is Italian-American; in actuality, he is Albanian.  

He first meets the Punisher while leading a raid against a Chinese-Triad bank with four enforcers.  Punisher kills the enforcers but leaves Mickey alive. He kidnaps the man and mentally tortures him for some time. He then recruits Mickey to help set up the identity of Johnny Tower and infiltrate the Carbone crime family; mainly by threatening to kill him if he fails to do so.<ref>''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' vol 1 #1 (March, 1992)</ref> 'Tower' and Mickey lead a raid on a rival's smuggling ring. It is successful and to cap it off, the Punisher kills the soldiers sent to back the two up. However, one of them was the nephew of the Don, who ran a numbers racket. Tower and Mickey are given that racket and Mickey goes out to celebrate with his new-found allies. While the party goes on, the Punisher wipes out the numbers racket. Further discussion pushes Tower out of the circle of power, Mickey convinces the Don that he is the brains of the partnership. The Punisher resolves to seduce the Don's niece, Rosalie Carbone, in order to gain information.<ref>"Punisher War Zone" #2 (1992)</ref>

When Julian discovers the situation, he kidnaps both Punisher and Fondozzi.<ref>"Punisher War Zone" #4 (1992)</ref> Punisher, however, is saved by [[Shotgun (comics)|Shotgun]], a mercenary hired by the United States. He's to wipe out the Carbones as they are not 'tame' Mafiosi. The duo rescue Mickey from being tortured to death by Carbone associates. Then with Mickey guarding Shotgun's truck, the duo wipe out the Carbone's American compound. A wounded soldier tells that the Carbone top commanders have gone to an island hide out.<ref>"Punisher War Zone" #5 (July 1992)</ref> The Punisher and Shotgun destroy this place, killing everyone, but Mickey stays behind.<ref>"Punisher War Zone" #6 (August 1992)</ref>

===Fighting the Secret Empire===

Mickey becomes deeply involved in the Punisher's attempt to bring down the criminal organization known as the [[Secret Empire]]. He ends up working closely with [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]], a long term associate of the Punisher. Secret Empire agents kidnap the duo; a coincidence causes them to believe Mickey and Microchip are two of the leaders of the Empire.<ref>"Daredevil" #307-309; "Nomad" #4-6; "Punisher War Journal" #46-48 (Sept. - Nov. 1992)</ref>

Mickey uses his contacts to gain information on a child pornography ring; the Punisher kills a distributor. <ref>"The Punisher Summer Special" #3 (August 1) 1993</ref>

Later, Mickey gets himself in trouble by working a meat theft scam. He tricks the Punisher into helping him escape an assassination team. Instead of killing him, the Punisher has Mickey work the streets to find out why big-name criminal elements are being seen far out of their territory. With the information Mickey assists in gathering, the Punisher busts up an attempt by the criminal underworld to buy bullet-proof armor suits. The only-functioning prototype is lost.<ref>"Punisher War Zone Annual" #1 (November 1993)</ref>

===Suicide Run===

Mickey and Microchip assist the Punisher during a mission to kill a collection of mob leaders in an otherwise empty office building. Mickey's first assist in the effort is a bluff through security to leave Frank in a wine supply truck. This seemingly goes off without a hitch: Mickey is unaware that the mobsters have wanted Frank to infiltrate the meeting all along. <ref>"Punisher War Journal" #61 (December 1993)</ref> 

Frank slaughters all his opponents. One mobster left compels Frank to blow the building. Mickey and Microchip are well away from their transportation vehicle when the cops surround it. Mickey encourages Microchip to detonate the van from afar in order to cover their tracks. Microchip refuses to kill innocent police officers. At this point, Mickey abandons him. <ref>''Punisher War Zone" #23 (Jan. 1994)</ref>

He gets sucked back into the situation during a war between Microchip and Castle. <ref>"Punisher" Vol 2 #104 (July 1995)</ref> The rogue [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent captures Mickey and interrogates him for intelligence about Microchip and Punisher. Stone Cold had been part of a program to take down vigilante groups but had activated it early, going vigilante himself. Mickey manages to escape his imprisonment, not knowing at the same time Stone Cold has slain Microchip with a rocket launcher. <ref>"Punisher War Journal" Vol 1 #79 (June 1995)</ref>

For some time after this, Mickey helps the Punisher periodically. He eventually starts his own car lot, Mickey's Salvage, where he fenced stolen cars.  When he unwittingly sold a car belonging to [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], he was visited by Widow and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], at which juncture Dagger used one of her soul-cleansing daggers on him.  After that, he refused to cooperate with the Punisher, saying that he had "gone straight"'; self-reformation is sometimes a side-effect of Dagger's powers.<ref>''Marvel Knights #10 vol. 1 (April 2001)</ref>
