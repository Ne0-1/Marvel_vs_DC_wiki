'''Mickey Fondozzi''' is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] character and an ally of the [[Punisher]].  

==Fictional character history==
Before he encountered the Punisher, Mickey was working for the Carbone crime family, who believed that he was Italian-American; in actuality, he was Albanian.  

He first met the Punisher while leading a raid against a triad bank with four enforcers.  Punisher killed the enforcers but left Mickey alive.  He then recruited him to help set up the identity of Johnny Tower, which he used to infiltrate the Carbone family.  When Julian Carbone, the head of the family, discovered the ruse, he kidnapped both Punisher and Fondozzi.  Punisher, however, was saved by [[Shotgun (comics)|Shotgun]], and the duo then rescued Mickey.  

For some time after this, Mickey helped the Punisher periodically, and eventually started his own car lot, Mickey's Salvage, where he fenced stolen cars.  When he unwittingly sold a car belonging to [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], he was visited by Widow and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], at which juncture Daggers used one of her soul-cleansing daggers on him.  After that, he refused to cooperate with the Punisher, saying that he had "gone straight".
