'''Fin Fang Foom''' is a [[fictional character]] and an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[dragon]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]], typically as an opponent of [[Iron Man]]. Fin Fang Foom first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' vol. 1, #89 (October [[1961]]).  Lee's inspiration for Foom's name was apparently the title of the film ''[[Chu Chin Chow]].'' <ref>"Bullpen Bulletins" (Jun. 2000 Marvel comics): "Stan's Soapbox" (column), by Stan Lee.  Lee also states this in the audio interview in ''Amazing Marvel Universe'' by Roy Thomas and Stan Lee.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

Although once believed to be a native of the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon in China, Fin Fang Foom is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu system of the Greater Magellanic Cloud. Foom and several other members of his race originally depart from their peaceful home-world with the intention of conquering other planets. The alien dragons land on Earth in ancient China, and the crew used their natural shape-shifting powers to mimic human form, intent on entering and studying human society before beginning their conquest. Foom was the exception, and acting as reserve is placed in a tomb and given an herb that places him in a catatonic state. <ref>Seen in flashback in ''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #274</ref> 
 
Fin Fang Foom is briefly awakened in the 8th Century, and returns to sleep with a second application of the herb. Foom sleeps until the modern age, when he is deliberately awakened by teenager Chan Liuchow, whose homeland is under threat from the [[Communist Party of China]]. Liuchow taunts Foom with the threat of the herb, and goads the dragon into chasing him straight into the Communist camp, which Foom decimates. Liuchow subsequently leads him back into his tomb, where the herb returns Foom to his sleep. <ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1, #89</ref> At some point, the sleeping Fin Fang Foom is captured by the [[Elder of the Universe]] known as the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]], and imprisoned in his subterranean collection of monsters. When the [[Mole Man]] attacks the facility, Foom and the other monsters escape <ref>''Marvel Monsters: Monsters On The Prowl'' #1 (2005)</ref> and are later captured by the recently-formed [[Fantastic Four]] and deposited on Monster Isle. <ref>''Fin Fang Four'' #1 (2005)</ref> Foom, however, has no desire to serve the Mole Man (who uses the island as a base) and leaves, returning to China and hibernation.

===Modern age===

Sometime later a scientist called Doctor Vault manages to mentally control the dragon and attack Vault's foe [[It the Living Colossus]]. Resisting the control, Foom instead aids the Colossus against an alien invasion - intent on preserving the planet for the dragon's own race to conquer at a later date. Vault's mind control briefly forces Foom to battle the Colossus; Foom overpowers his opponent with martial arts before freeing his mind and returning to hibernation yet again. <ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #23 - 24</ref> 

Years later, Fin Fang Foom is again roused from his slumber when his body is possessed by the [[demon]] Aan Taanu. Combating a group of occult adventurers (including an older Chan Liuchow, now a Professor) known as the [[Legion of Night]] in New York, Taanu is exorcised from Foom's body, and the confused Foom once again returns to hibernation. <ref>''Legion of Night'' #1 - 2</ref>

At some point in the modern age the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#M|Makluan]] vessel is found by a man who steals ten sophisticated rings from it, and eventually becomes the [[supervillain]] the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. Years later the Mandarin is directed to the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon by the captain of the vessel - in human guise - and finds and wakes Fin Fang Foom, using the dragon to threaten the Chinese government. When the other Makluans shed their human forms to begin their conquest, the Mandarin realizes he is being used and joins forces with the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]] to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation. <ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #275</ref>

Although Fin Fang Foom's body is destroyed, his spirit survives and bonds itself to a small dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Foom's mental urging. Using Yuan's body as a conduit for his power, Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan's body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom once again, with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan's mind. Due to several legal complications, however, the defeated dragon is sent to Monster Isle again, <ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 2, #15 - 18</ref> where he and several other monsters go on to briefly battle the dimensionally-displaced [[Justice League of America]]. <ref>''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #1</ref>

Tired of the constant defeats and with the other members of the Makluan crew dead, Foom decides to reform and becomes a follower of [[Buddhism]]. He enters into a rehabilitation program, which sees himself and three other monsters - the robot [[Elektro (comics)|Elektro]], the giant ape [[Gorgilla]] and the alien [[Googam]] - shrunk down to human size, hypnotically stripped of their powers, and allowed to enter human society. Taking up a job as head chef in a Chinese restaurant within the [[Baxter Building]], Foom teams up with the other monsters to defeat the size-changing warlord [[Tim Boo Baa]] as the "Fin Fang Four." <ref>''Fin Fang Four'' #1 (2005)</ref>

Foom later appears as a pawn of the [[Beyond CorporationÂ©]], and while having reverted back to its' original size, lacks any real intelligence. Foom is eventually defeated by [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], who allows himself to be swallowed by the dragon and then eviscerates it internally. <ref>''Nextwave'' vol. 1, #2 (2006)</ref> "Fin Fang Four" writer [[Roger Langridge]] notes that if given the opportunity to do a further Fin Fang Foom story, he would explain that the Beyond Corporation's Foom was merely a clone of Foom made when intelligence agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] took a sample of his DNA years ago. <ref>[http://monsterblog.oneroom.org/meet_the_monsters/fin_fang_foom.html Monster Blog! A Tribute to the Monsters of Jacky Kirby]</ref> 

Fin Fang Foom later reappears, still in shrunken form, and begrudgingly aids [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] - the servant of [[Dr. Strange]] - in defeating a force of [[HYDRA]] agents. <ref>''Marvel Holiday Special'' (2006)</ref>

There have also been two imitations of Fin Fang Foom. On the first occasion the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]] imitated Foom to try and fool the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #379</ref> while the second involved the villain [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] morphing a creature called a Mindless One into a copy of Foom to battle the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. <ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3, #79</ref> Thor also claims at one point to have killed the true Fin Fang Foom in battle, and uses his bones to build a tomb in the realm of [[Asgard]]. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #80</ref>  The character [[Howard the Duck]] also has dreams of playing cards with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Man-Thing]], [[Bigfoot]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]] and Foom.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' vol. 3 #1</ref>
