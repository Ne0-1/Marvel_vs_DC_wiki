'''Fin Fang Foom''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #89 (Oct. 1961), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Fin Fang Foom appeared during Marvel's period of experimentation with monsters, being intregrated into the Marvel Universe during the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]]. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[toy]]s; [[trading cards]] and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==
Stan Lee's inspiration for Foom's name was apparently the title of the film ''[[Chu Chin Chow]].''<ref>"Bullpen Bulletins" (Jun. 2000 Marvel comics): "Stan's Soapbox" (column), by Stan Lee.  Lee states this in the audio interview in ''Amazing Marvel Universe'' by Roy Thomas and Stan Lee.</ref> 

In the title ''[[Iron Man]]'' it is revealed in [[flashback]] that the character is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu system of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|Greater Magellanic Cloud]]. The alien and several other members of his race originally depart from their peaceful homeworld with the intention of conquering other planets. The alien dragons land on Earth in ancient [[China]], and the crew used their natural [[shapeshifting]] powers to mimic human form, intent on entering and studying human society before beginning their conquest. The alien navigator was the exception and, acting as reserve, was placed in a tomb and given a herb that places him in a catatonic state.<ref>''Iron Man'' #274 (Nov. 1991)</ref> 
 
The character is first awakened in the title ''Strange Tales'',<ref>''Strange Tales'' #89 (Oct. 1961)</ref> being deliberately roused by teenager Chan Liuchow, whose homeland is under threat from invading forces of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]]. Liuchow taunts Foom with the threat of the herb, and goads the dragon into chasing him straight into the Communist camp, which Foom destroys. Liuchow subsequently leads the character back into his tomb, where the herb returns Foom to his sleep. In the [[one-shot]] ''Marvel Monsters: Monsters On The Prowl''  Fin Fang Foom is captured by the [[Elders of the Universe|Elder of the Universe]] known as the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]], and imprisoned with a subterranean collection of monsters.<ref>''Marvel Monsters: Monsters On The Prowl'' #1 (Dec. 2005)</ref> Foom and the monsters reappear in the one-shot ''[[Fin Fang Four]]'', being captured by the recently-formed Fantastic Four and deposited on Monster Isle. The character, however, returns to China and hibernation.<ref>''[[Fin Fang Four]]'' #1 (Dec. 2005)</ref>

In the title ''Astonishing Tales'' scientist Doctor Vault manages to mentally control the dragon and attack Vault's foe, [[It the Living Colossus]]. After a brief battle, Foom resists the control and aids the Colossus against an alien invasion (intent on preserving the planet for the dragon's own race to conquer at a later date) before returning to hibernation once again.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #23 (Apr. 1974) - 24 (June 1974)</ref> In the limited series ''Legion of Night'', Foom is again roused from his slumber when his body is possessed by the [[demon]] Aan Taanu. Combating a group of occult adventurers (including an older Chan Liuchow, now a Professor) known as [[The Legion of Night]] in New York, Taanu is exorcised from Foom's body, and the character once again returns to hibernation.<ref>''Legion of Night'' #1 - 2 (Oct. 1991)</ref>

The [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#M|Makluan]] vessel is eventually found in the title ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' by a man who steals ten sophisticated rings from it, and becomes the [[supervillain]] the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #50 (Feb. 1964)</ref> In the title ''Iron Man'', the Mandarin is directed to the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon by a man called Chen Hsu, who is also an alien dragon and the captain of the vessel. The Mandarin finds and wakes Fin Fang Foom, using the dragon to threaten the Chinese government. Foom helps the Mandarin take control of one third of China, and is then revealed as an alien of Kakaranathara. With "Chen Hsu", whose true form is also revealed, the pair begin to summon their fellows, who had been disguised as humans for centuries. Realizing he has been tricked, the Mandarin joins forces with heroes [[Iron Man]] and [[War Machine]] to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation.<ref>''Iron Man'' #261 - 264 (Oct. 1900 - Jan. 1992); 267 (Apr. 1991) & 270 - 275 (July - Dec. 1992)</ref>

The character reappears in the second volume of ''Iron Man''. Although Fin Fang Foom's body is destroyed, the character's spirit survives and bonds itself to a small dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Foom's mental urging. Using Yuan's body as a conduit for his power, Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan's body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan's mind. Due to [[legal]] complications the defeated dragon is sent to Monster Isle once again.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 2, #15 - 18 (Apr. - July 1999)</ref> Foom and several other monsters briefly battle the dimensionally-displaced [[DC Comics]] superhero team the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in the limited series ''[[JLA/Avengers]]''.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1 (Sep. 2003)</ref>

With the other members of the Makluan crew dead, Foom decides to reform and becomes a follower of [[Buddhism]]. The character enters into a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] program, and with three other monsters - the robot [[Elektro (comics)|Elektro]]; the giant ape [[Gorgilla]], and the alien [[Googam]] - is shrunk down to human size, [[hypnotic]]ally stripped of their powers, and allowed to enter human society. One-shot ''Fin Fang Four'' reveals Foom has taken a job as head [[chef]] in a Chinese [[restaurant]] within the [[Baxter Building]], with the character and the other monsters teaming together to defeat the size-changing warlord [[Tim Boo Ba]].<ref>''Fin Fang Four'' #1 (Dec. 2005)</ref> In a ''Marvel Holiday Special'', Foom begrudgingly aids [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] - the servant of [[Doctor Strange]] - in defeating a force of [[HYDRA]] agents.<ref>''Marvel Holiday Special'' 2006 (Jan. 2007)</ref>
