==Character biography==
Fin Fang Foom is first awakened by teenager Chan Liuchow, whose homeland is under threat from invading forces of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]]. Liuchow goads the dragon into chasing him into the Communist camp (which Foom destroys) and then back to Foom's tomb, where the creature is returned to sleep via the use of a rare herb.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #89 (Oct. 1961)</ref> Scientist Doctor Vault locates and mentally controls the dragon for use against Vault's foe, [[It, the Living Colossus]]. After a brief battle, Foom resists the control and aids the Colossus against an alien invasion (intent on preserving the planet for the alien's own race to conquer at a later date) before returning to hibernation once again.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #23 - 24 (April & June 1974)</ref> Foom is again roused from his slumber when his body is possessed by the [[demon]] "Aan Taanu". Combating a group of occult adventurers (including an older Chan Liuchow, now a Professor) known as [[The Legion of Night]] in New York, Taanu is exorcised from Foom's body, and the alien once again returns to hibernation.<ref>''Legion of Night'' #1 - 2 (Oct. 1991)</ref>

It is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that Foom is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu system of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|Greater Magellanic Cloud]]. The aliens arrive on Earth in ancient [[China]], intending to conquer the planet. Using their natural [[shapeshifting]] powers to mimic human form, the aliens infiltrate human society to study it before beginning their conquest. The alien navigator is the exception, and acting as a reserve is placed in a tomb in a catatonic state.<ref>''Iron Man'' #274 (Nov. 1991)</ref> 

The [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#M|Makluan]] vessel is eventually found by a man who steals ten sophisticated rings from it, and becomes the [[supervillain]] the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #50 (Feb. 1964)</ref> The Mandarin is directed to the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon by a man called Chen Hsu, who is also an alien dragon and the captain of the vessel. The Mandarin finds and wakes Fin Fang Foom, using the dragon to threaten the Chinese government. Foom helps the Mandarin take control of one third of China, and is then revealed as an alien of Kakaranathara. With "Chen Hsu", whose true form is also revealed, the pair begin to summon their fellows, who had been disguised as humans for centuries. Realizing he has been tricked, the Mandarin joins forces with heroes [[Iron Man]] and [[War Machine]] to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation.<ref>''Iron Man'' #261 - 264 (Oct. 1900 - Jan. 1992); 267 (April 1991) & 270 - 275 (July - Dec. 1992)</ref>

Although Foom's body is destroyed, the alien's spirit survives and bonds itself to a small dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Foom's mental urging. Using Yuan's body as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for his power, Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan's body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan's mind. Due to [[legal]] complications the defeated dragon is sent to Monster Isle once again.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 2, #15 - 18 (April - July 1999)</ref> Foom and several other monsters also briefly battle the dimensionally displaced superhero team the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 2003)</ref>
 
Fin Fang Foom is captured by the [[Elders of the Universe|Elder of the Universe]] known as the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]], and imprisoned with a subterranean collection of monsters.<ref>''Marvel Monsters: Monsters On The Prowl'' #1 (Dec. 2005)</ref> After being captured along with other monsters by the recently formed [[Fantastic Four]] and deposited on "Monster Isle", Foom returns to China and hibernation.<ref>''[[Fin Fang Four]]'' #1 (Dec. 2005)</ref>

Foom becomes head [[chef]] in a Chinese [[restaurant]] within the [[Baxter Building]], and teams with the other monsters to defeat the size-changing warlord [[Tim Boo Ba]].<ref>''Fin Fang Four'' #1 (Dec. 2005)</ref> Foom begrudgingly aids [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] - the servant of [[Doctor Strange]] - in defeating a force of [[HYDRA]] agents.<ref>''Marvel Holiday Special'' 2006 (Jan. 2007)</ref>
