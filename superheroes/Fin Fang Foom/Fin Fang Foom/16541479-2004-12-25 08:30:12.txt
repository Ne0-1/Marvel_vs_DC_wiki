'''Fin Fang Foom''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[dragon]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who has served as an ally to various other [[monster]]s and an [[antagonist]] who has opposed a number of [[superhero]]es.  He first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' volume 1 #89 ([[1961]]).

Fin Fang Foom is a fifteen-story [[humanoid]] dragon of the [[Chinese dragon|Eastern]] variety.  He is an [[alien]], hailing from the planet Kakaratharia.  His [[starship]] crash-landed on Earth, and he tried to take over the Earth twice, being defeated by humans each time.  He entered [[hibernation]]; during this time, his ship's technology was ransacked by the man who would become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].  He awoke briefly to assist the [[golem]]-like creature called It, the Living Colossus in a battle against a human would-be world conqueror, then returned to his slumber.  Years later, the Mandarin found and awoke him, and the two partnered to battle the superhero [[Iron Man]].  Fin Fang Foom has since fought Iron Man on a number of subsequent occasions.  He was once seen to battle [[Thor (comics)|Thor]], though this was revealed to be a disguised [[Jormungand]].

In the Iron Man [[animated series]], it was Fin Fang Foom, not the Mandarin, who served as Iron Man's primary antagonist.
