'''Fin Fang Foom''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[dragon]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who has served as an ally to various other [[monster]]s and an [[antagonist]] who has opposed a number of [[superhero]]es.  He first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' volume 1 #89 ([[1961]]).

==Character biography==
Fin Fang Foom is a fifteen-story [[humanoid]] dragon of the [[Chinese dragon|Eastern]] variety.  He is an [[Extraterrestrial life | alien]], hailing from the planet Kakaratharia.  His [[starship]] crash-landed on Earth, and he tried to take over the Earth twice, being defeated by humans each time.  

He entered [[hibernation]]; during this time, his ship's technology was ransacked by the man who would become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].  He awoke briefly to assist the [[golem]]-like creature called It, the Living Colossus in a battle against a human would-be world conqueror, then returned to his slumber.  Years later, he was briefly awakened by the [[demon]] Aan Taanu, who possessed his body during an attempt to conquer the Earth.  Aan Taanu was defeated and exorcised from Fin Fang Foom's body by the Legion of Night, a group of occult adventurers.

Eventually, the Mandarin found and awoke Fin Fang Foom, and the two partnered to battle the superhero [[Iron Man]].  Fin Fang Foom has since fought Iron Man on a number of subsequent occasions.  He was once seen to battle [[Thor (comics)|Thor]], though this was revealed to be a disguised [[Jormungand]].  Thor later claimed to have killed Fin Fang Foom, although the dragon has been seen since this event allegedly occurred.

Recently, it has been revealed that [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] had captured and shrunk Fin Fang Foom down to human size.  The Fantastic Four have attempted to rehabilitate him and slowly reintegrate him into society, as shown in October 2005's ''Marvel Monsters: Fin Fang Four''.  There, he teamed with the robot Elektro, the giant ape Gorgilla, and the alien Googam to defeat the size-changing warlord Tim Boo Baa.

==Powers and abilities==
Fin Fang Foom possesses vast superhuman strength; the upward limit of what he can lift exceeds 100 tons. He has the ability to fly via his wings, and can spew intensely destructive flames from his mouth for distances as far away from himself as 300 feet. He also has incredible resistance to injury and cannot be injured by conventional weaponry. He can regenerate from extremely severe wounds. He once displayed the ability to take the form of a vast number of normal-sized lizards. He is also highly intelligent, despite appearing to be a dumb beast.
