'''Miss Arrow''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She was created by [[Peter David]] and [[Todd Nauck]]. She is a nurse at Midtown High School, where Peter Parker (AKA [[Spider-Man]]) worked as a teacher.

{{spoiler}}
==Fictional character history==
Due to the events of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] and the Super-Human Registration Act, Parker decided to register and release his name to the public. Peter was considering leaving the school because of this.

[[Flash Thompson]], not wanting to believe that his idol was "Puny Parker", convinced himself that Peter was merely covering for Spider-Man and goaded him into a dodgeball fight. Peter, no longer needing to protect his identity, made quick work of Flash by kicking the ball into his face and knocking him out.

Flash was taken to the nurse's office, where he met Nurse Arrow. ("My parents were inveterate hippies", Arrow said when asked to explain her unusual name.) Flash took a liking to her, and began flirting. When he asked her if she would have problems with the "whole black/white thing". Arrow, who was [[African-American]], responded "The world's not black-and-white...just shades of gray."

Later, the school was attacked by the third [[Mysterio]], Francis Klum, who was looking to get revenge at Spider-Man from a previous defeat. Also entering the fray were Daniel Berkhart, the second Mysterio, and even Quentin Beck, the original Mysterio, long thought dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a fight with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].

Miss Arrow found herself in contact with Beck. Beck told her that she seemed to be an innocent bystander, but inferred that she was more than that with "'seem' is such a subtle word. As in things are not ''always'' what they seem." He went on to mention that he knew about Arrow's 'superiors', and that he could easily see through her charade. He told her that she must work to keep Peter at the school because his superiors wanted it, and so did hers. Once again, Arrow claimed to not know what he was talking about.

Beck later vanished, although Arrow found herself face-to-face with Klum. Klum prepared to hold her hostage, telling that she was to become a pawn in a much larger game. Arrow then revealed her true nature, extending large stingers from her wrists. Telling Klum she was no one's pawn, she plunged one of them into his chest. Before she could finish him off, he teleported.

Because of her stingers, which are similar to Spider-Man's new powers that he received during ''[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]'', some believe that Arrow could be connected to the antagonist of the latter storyline.[http://spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/friendly_neighborhood_spiderman/013.html] Nothing has been proven yet, however.
