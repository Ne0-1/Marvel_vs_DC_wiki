'''"Bibbo" Bibbowski''' is a supporting character in ''[[Superman]]'' comics. He first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #428, by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Jerry Ordway]], when Superman was looking for information in a [[Suicide Slum]] bar called the Ace O' Clubs. Bibbo, thinking this was "some clown in a Superman suit" punched Superman, and damaged his hand. He gained respect for the Man of Steel because "yer tough". He would later refer to Superman as his "fav'rit".

Later stories established Bibbo as a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] and former [[boxing|boxer]], however he remained largely a comic relief character, portrayed as vaguely well-meaning but not too bright. His admiration for Superman seemingly remained based on physical strength, briefly being transferred to [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]] when the Czarnian appeared tougher. 

He became a more significant part of the stories when he found a winning lottery ticket, and used the money to buy the Ace O' Clubs and help those living in the Slum. By the time of the ''[[Death of Superman]]'' storyline, he had come to represent the idea of ordinary people living up to Superman's example.

Bibbo would briefly create an alternative identity for himself after Superman's death. He temporarily named himself Superdood in hopes of helping fight crime while Superman was away.

In ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', Ordway introduced Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifistic scientist brother.

==Other media==
Bibbo briefly appeared as the owner of the Ace of Clubs an episode of ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. He was played by [[Troy Evans]].

He also appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', as [[Lois Lane|Lois]]'s source on the docks. In this series he was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] and bore a slight resemblance to [[Popeye]]. Bibbo also made a background appearance in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter".

Bibbo appears in an early scene in the [[2006]] [[Bryan Singer]]-directed movie ''[[Superman Returns]]'' played by [[Jack Larson]], who had portrayed [[Jimmy Olsen]] in the [[1950s]] ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' (as well as in one episode of the ''[[Lois and Clark]]'' TV series). Larson's credit only reads "Bo the bartender", but since his character is working in the Ace o'Clubs, many fans believe he is Bo "Bibbo" Bibbowski.
