'''"Bibbo" Bibbowski''' is a supporting character in ''[[Superman]]'' comics. He first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman]]'' #428, by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Jerry Ordway]], when Superman was looking for information in a [[Suicide Slum]] bar called the Ace O' Clubs. Bibbo, thinking this was "some clown in a Superman suit" punched Superman, and damaged his hand. He gained respect for the Man of Steel because "yer tough". He'd later refer to Superman as his "fav'rit".

Later stories established Bibbo as a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] and former [[boxing|boxer]], however he remained largely a comic relief character, portrayed as vaguely well-meaning but not too bright. His admiration for Superman seemingly remained based on physical strength, briefly being transferred to [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]] when the Czarian appeared tougher. 

He became a more significent part of the stories when he found a winning lottery ticket, and used the money to buy the Ace O' Clubs and help those living in the Slum. By the time of the ''[[Death of Superman]]'' storyline, he had come to represent the idea of ordinary people living up to Superman's example.

In ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|The Power of Shazam!]]'', Ordway introduced Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifistic scientist brother.
