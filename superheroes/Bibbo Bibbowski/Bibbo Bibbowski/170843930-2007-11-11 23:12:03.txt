'''"Bibbo" Bibbowski''' is a supporting character in ''[[Superman]]'' comics. He first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #428 (May 1987).

==Fictional character biography==
Bibbo first appears in a [[Suicide Slum]] bar called the Ace O' Clubs.   When Superman comes in looking for information Bibbo, thinking this is "some clown in a Superman suit", punches Superman, damaging his hand.  He gains respect for the Man of Steel because "yer tough". He would later refer to Superman as his "fav'rit".

Later stories establish Bibbo as a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] and former [[boxing|boxer]], however he remains largely a comic relief character, portrayed as vaguely well-meaning but not too bright. His admiration for Superman remains based on physical strength, as his admiration is briefly transferred to [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]] when the Czarnian appears tougher. 

He becomes a more significant part of the comic when he finds a winning lottery ticket and uses the money to buy the Ace O' Clubs bar and help those living in the Slum.

When Superman dies at the hands of [[Doomsday]], Bibbo is part of the team who unsuccessfully performs CPR. Shortly afterward, Bibbo encounters a young man who, his family rendered homeless by Doomsday's rampage, is blatantly selling "Death of Superman" commemorative souvenirs during a public commemoration honoring the Man of Steel. At first outraged at the man's crassness, Bibbo feels some sympathy for his losses and buys his entire souvenir stock to get him off the street, then offers him a job at the Ace O' Clubs. While Superman is gone, Bibbo takes to putting on a 'disguise' of sorts and helping out on the streets. His rescue of a cat from a tree is featured second-hand on the news.

Bibbo briefly takes care of a small white dog named Krypto, not to be confused with the [[Krypto|current Kryptonian dog]] of the same name. The original Krypto's name arose when the engraver Bibbo hired made an intentional mistake, trying to extort more money from Bibbo's (the price accorded was for six letters). It was supposed to be Krypton. Angry, Bibbo took the dog tag as it was. Krypto would later be watched over by Superboy, then even later, Superboy's Hawaiin neighbor.

The Ace O' Clubs bar is the site of a battle between the life-force devouring [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and the heroic [[Aztek (comics)|Aztek]]. Bibbo, usually one for joining in on a fight, wisely stays back in this incident, as it was well known contact with Parasite would kill.

In ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', Ordway introduces Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifistic scientist brother.

==Alternate versions==

Bibbo plays an important part in the alternate universe story ''[[Superman: The Dark Side]]''. He watches out for [[Jimmy Olsen]], keeps an eye on [[Lois Lane]] and fights back against invading alien forces from [[Apokolips]].

In the animated universe Bibbo is an unemployeed sea captain who frequents the Hobb's Bay section of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].  He appears in the episodes "[[A Little Piece of Home]]", "[[Livewire]]", "[[A Fish Story (Superman: The Animated Series episode)|A Fish Story]]", [[World's Finest (animated story)|"World's Finest" part 1]], and "[[Heavy Metal (Superman: The Animated Series)|Heavy Metal]]", and is voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]

Bibbo appears in an early scene in the [[2006]] [[Bryan Singer]]-directed movie ''[[Superman Returns]]'' played by [[Jack Larson]], who had portrayed [[Jimmy Olsen]] in the [[1950s]] ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' (as well as in one episode of the ''[[Lois and Clark]]'' TV series). Larson's credit only reads "Bo the bartender", but since his character is working in the Ace o'Clubs, it can be inferred that he is Bo "Bibbo" Bibbowski.
