'''Bo "Bibbo" Bibbowski''' is a supporting character in ''[[Superman]]'' comics. He first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #428 (May 1987).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Bibbo | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 47  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Bibbo first appears in a [[Suicide Slum]] bar called the Ace O' Clubs.   When Superman comes in looking for information Bibbo, thinking this is "some clown in a Superman suit", punches Superman, damaging his hand.  He gains respect for the Man of Steel because "yer tough". He would later refer to Superman as his "fav'rit" hero.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Later stories establish Bibbo as a [[stevedore|longshoreman]] and former [[boxing|boxer]], however he remains largely a [[comic relief]] character, portrayed as vaguely well-meaning but not particularly intelligent. His admiration for Superman remains based on physical strength, as his admiration is briefly transferred to [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] when the Czarnian appears tougher. 

Bibbo becomes a more significant part of the comic when he finds a winning [[lottery]] ticket and uses the money to buy the Ace O' Clubs bar and help those living in the Slum.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Bibbo attempts assistance when Superman becomes involved in a drawn-out fight against the murderous [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. Bibbo works with the genius [[Professor Hamilton]] in a plan to blast Doomsday with a large laser. They score a direct hit, but the monster is not affected.

When Doomsday and Superman ultimately kill each other, Bibbo is part of the team who unsuccessfully performs [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on the hero. Shortly afterward, Bibbo encounters a young man who, his family rendered homeless by Doomsday's rampage, is blatantly selling "Death of Superman" commemorative souvenirs during a public commemoration honoring the Man of Steel. At first outraged at the man's crassness, Bibbo feels some sympathy for his losses and buys his entire souvenir stock to get him off the street, then offers him a job at the Ace O' Clubs. While Superman is gone, Bibbo takes to putting on a 'disguise' of sorts and helping out on the streets. His rescue of a cat from a tree is featured second-hand on the news.

Bibbo briefly takes care of a small white dog named Krypto, not to be confused with the [[Krypto (comics)|current Kryptonian dog of the same name]]. The original Krypto's name arose when the engraver Bibbo hired made an intentional mistake, trying to extort more money from Bibbo (the price accorded was for six letters). It was supposed to be Krypton. Angry, Bibbo took the dog tag as it was. Krypto would later be watched over by Superboy, then even later a neighbor Krypto has come to like.

A poster seen by the hero Aztek indicates that at one point, Bibbo fought the hero [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] during a charity boxing event. <ref>''Aztek'' #4</ref> Later in the series, The Ace O' Clubs bar is the site of a battle between the life-force devouring [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and Aztek.<ref>''Aztek'' #7</ref> Bibbo and his friends purposely ignore the fight, playing cards instead and trusting others to handle the villain.

In ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', Ordway introduces Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifist scientist brother.

Bibbo makes a reappearance in ''Superman'' #679, shown as one of the champions of Metropolis that the villainous [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]] defeated. He is established by then as having, or working, in the Ace of Clubs, even bringing himself to boldly menace [[Atom Smasher (DC Comics)|Atom Smasher]] for "Talking trash about Sooperman". <ref>''Justice Society of America'' #27 (2009)</ref>

==Alternate versions==

Bibbo plays an important part in the alternate universe story ''[[Superman: The Dark Side]]''. He watches out for [[Jimmy Olsen]], keeps an eye on [[Lois Lane]] and fights back against invading alien forces from [[Apokolips]].

==Appearances in other media==
===Live action television===

Bibbo briefly appears as the owner of the Ace of Clubs in "Double Jeopardy", an episode of ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. He was played by [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]].

Ace of Clubs appeared thrice (as an upscale nightclub) in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'''s seventh season and numerous times in the eight season. Bibbo has yet to appear.

===Animated series===
Bibbo is featured in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', as [[Lois Lane|Lois]]' information source on the docks.  In the animated universe Bibbo is an unemployed sea captain{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} who frequents the Hobb's Bay section of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].  He appears in the episodes "[[A Little Piece of Home]]", "[[Livewire]]", "[[A Fish Story (Superman: The Animated Series episode)|A Fish Story]]", [[World's Finest (animated story)|"World's Finest" part 1]], and "[[Heavy Metal (Superman: The Animated Series)|Heavy Metal]]", and is voiced by [[Brad Garrett]].

Bibbo makes a non-speaking appearance in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter".

===Film===
Bibbo apparently appears in an early scene in the 2006 [[Bryan Singer]]-directed movie ''[[Superman Returns]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} played by [[Jack Larson]], who had portrayed [[Jimmy Olsen]] in the 1950s ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' (as well as in one episode of the ''[[Lois and Clark]]'' TV series). Larson's credit only reads "Bo the bartender", but since his character is working in the Ace o'Clubs, it could be inferred that he is Bo "Bibbo" Bibbowski{{Or|date=July 2009}}. Although Larson, 75 at the time of filming, was much older than the "Bibbo" character in the comics (usually portrayed as middle-aged, late 40s-late 50s); a more logical deduction might be that "Bo," in fact, is "Bibbo's" father, or some other older relative.{{Or|date=July 2009}}
