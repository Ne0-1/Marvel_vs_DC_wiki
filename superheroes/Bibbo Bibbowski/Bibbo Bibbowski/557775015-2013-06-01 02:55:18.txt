==Fictional character biography==
Bibbo first appears in a [[Suicide Slum]] bar called the Ace O' Clubs.   When Superman comes in looking for information Bibbo, thinking this is "some clown in a Superman suit", punches Superman, damaging his hand.  He gains respect for the Man of Steel because "yer tough". He would later refer to Superman as his "fav'rit" hero.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

During the Eradicator saga, Bibbo teams up with [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] and Raof, a teleporter and a tribute to Marvel's [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], to see Lobo kill Superman. Lobo gives Bibbo a set of special goggles that will record the battle -or anything Bibbo is looking at. All three, however, are smashed on Okarran liquor. and thus suffer loss of all memory of the battle, which Superman won by a ruse, engineered by the Eradicator artifact. Also Bibbo's had worn the goggles backwards, and thus the entire recording was of his reactions and talking. Thus the aliens who retained Lobo to kill Superman have no proof that there even was a battle.[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]] 464

Bibbo becomes a more significant part of the comic when he finds a winning [[lottery]] ticket dropped by [[Gangbuster]] and uses the money to buy the Ace O' Clubs bar and help those living in the Slum.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

When Doomsday and Superman ultimately kill each other, Bibbo is on the scene. He and Hamilton use a device to try to perform CPR on Superman. The plan fails and Bibbo is injured. Hamilton takes over the CPR but he also fails.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #498 (January 1993)</ref>

Shortly afterward, Bibbo encounters a young man who, his family rendered homeless by Doomsday's rampage, is blatantly selling "Death of Superman" commemorative souvenirs during a public commemoration honoring the Man of Steel. At first outraged at the man's crassness, Bibbo feels some sympathy for his losses and buys his entire souvenir stock to get him off the street, then offers him a job at the Ace O' Clubs.<ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #20 (February 1993)</ref> While Superman is gone, Bibbo takes to putting on a 'disguise' of sorts and helping out on the streets. Around this time he saves a man from suicide. This is mostly through tall tales concerning various super-villains.<ref>''Showcase '96'' #10 (November 1996)</ref>

Bibbo briefly takes care of a small white dog named Krypto which he had saved from drowning, not to be confused with the [[Krypto (comics)|Kryptonian dog of the same name]]. The name was supposed to be "Krypton", but the engraver Bibbo hired to make a name tag made an intentional mistake, trying to extort more money from Bibbo (the price accorded was for six letters). Bibbo took the tag as it was.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #502 (July 1993)</ref>

A poster seen by the hero Aztek indicates that at one point, Bibbo fought the hero [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] during a charity boxing event.<ref>''Aztek'' #4 (November 1996)</ref> Later in the series, The Ace O' Clubs bar is the site of a battle between the life-force devouring [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] and Aztek.<ref>''Aztek'' #7 (February 1997)</ref> Bibbo and his friends purposely ignore the fight, playing cards instead and trusting others to handle the villain.

In ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', Ordway introduces Professor Bibbowski, Bibbo's pacifist scientist brother.

Bibbo makes a reappearance in ''Superman'' #679, shown as one of the champions of Metropolis that the villainous [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]] defeated. He is established by then as having, or working, in the Ace of Clubs, even bringing himself to boldly menace [[Atom Smasher (DC Comics)|Atom Smasher]] for "Talking trash about Sooperman".<ref>''Justice Society of America'' #27 (July 2009)</ref>
