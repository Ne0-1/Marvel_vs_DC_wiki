'''Spider-Woman''' is the codename of several [[fictional]] characters in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first Spider-Woman Jessica Drew also had her own cartoon series and the second Spider-Woman Julia Carpenter was a regular in the first Iron Man cartoon series.

==Publication history==
[[Marvel Comics]]' then-publisher [[Stan Lee]] said in 1978, shortly after Spider-Woman's debut in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #32 (Feb. 1977) and the start of the character's 50-issue self-titled series ([[cover-date]]d April 1978&nbsp;– June 1983), that the character originated because,
{{quote|I suddenly realized that some other company may quickly put out a book like that and claim they have the right to use the name, and I thought we'd better do it real fast to copyright the name. So we just batted one quickly, and that's exactly what happened. I wanted to protect the name, because it's the type of thing [where] someone else might say, 'Hey, why don't we put out a Spider-Woman; they can't stop us.' ... You know, years ago we brought out [[Wonder Man]], and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[DC Comics]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and ... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got [[Power Girl]] [after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Oh, boy. How unfair.<ref>"Hello, Culture Lovers: Stan the Map Raps with Marvel Maniacs at [[James Madison University]]", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #42, October 1978, p. 55</ref>}}

Following that initial ''Spider-Woman'' series, more followed. Volume two was a [[miniseries]] published from November 1993 through February 1994; volume three was published from July 1999 through December 2000; and volume four, featuring Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, was published from November 2009 through May 2010.

Currently, volume five is being published as of November 2014, featuring Jessica Drew as Spider-Woman.
