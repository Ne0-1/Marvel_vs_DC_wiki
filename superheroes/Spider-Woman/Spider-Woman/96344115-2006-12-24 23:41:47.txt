'''''Spider-Woman''''' is the codename of several fictional characters in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  They are based on the character [[Spider-Man]].


==Earth 616 Spider-Women==
* [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]], the original and current Spider-Woman.  She starred in her own animated series in 1979.
* [[Julia Carpenter]], a former Avengers member, now called '''[[Arachne (comics)|Arachne]]'''.
* [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)]], who briefly impersonated Spider-Man before receiving her own short-lived comic series and will be seen within the ''[[Loners]]'' miniseries.
* [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)]], the only villain to use the name.

==Alternate continuity Spider-Women== 
* Spider-Woman ([[Mary Jane Watson]]), [[ninja]] of the Spider-clan, is an alternate version of the character in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] reality.  
* Another version of Mary Jane as Spider-Woman can be found in the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] series. (See [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]]).
* In [[MC2]] continuity, Jessica Drew has never regained her powers and thus did not return to being Spider-Woman.
* In the comic book ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', an [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Ultimate Spider-Woman]] debuted in issue #98, but was not given the name "Spider-Woman" until issue #102. Though her creators named her [[Jessica Drew]], she is a female [[clone]] of [[Peter Parker]], and retains all of his memories.
