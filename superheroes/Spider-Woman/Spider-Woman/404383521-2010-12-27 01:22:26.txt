The first was published from April 1978 through June 1983; the second, which was a [[limited series]], was published from November 1993 through February 1994; the third was published from July 1999 through December 2000; and the fourth, featuring Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, was published from November 2009 through May 2010.
