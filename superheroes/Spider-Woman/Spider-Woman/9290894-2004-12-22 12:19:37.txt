'''Spider-Woman''' is a character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. There have been four women to go by this [[superhero]] alias.

The Current Spider-Woman (or Spider-Woman IV) is Martha "Mattie" Franklin.  She was a troubled youth who grew up with her mother.  Franklin eventually settled with her uncle [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and she was granted her powers after overhearing a phone call between her father and Norman Osborn about the Gathering of the Five.  She secretly masqueraded as her father and was endowed with the awesome powers that Norman Osborne had wanted for himself.  During [[Spider-Man]]&#8217;s leave she wore his costume and filled in for him.  After Spider-Man&#8217;s return with both previous Spider-Woman&#8217;s blessings she assumed that identity.  Eventually, the villainous Spider-Woman (''see below'') who had the ability to steal the powers of all the other Spider-Women surfaced.  After losing even her own powers, Franklin still battled with the evil Spider-Woman and as a result not only did she reabsorbed her own powers but also every power she had stolen along with the evil Spider-Woman's own.

'''Spider-Woman I:''' '''(Jessica Drew)''' At a young age Jessica was lethally poisoned by radiation.  In an attempt to save her life Jessica was injected with an experimental serum based on spiders blood, which had also been irradiated.  Because the serum did not have any apparent effect on her, the man who would come to be known as the [[High Evolutionary]] placed her in a genetic accelerator. While in suspension she aged at a decelerated rate and when finally released decades later, Drew was only fourteen years old.  Her first few years were confusing as she adjusted to life among other humans.  Eventually H.Y.D.R.A. found and recruited her.  Through brain washing and manipulation she was convinced she was not human but actually an evolved spider.  During this time she went by the alias of Arachne on a mission against S.H.I.E.L.D. Jessica learned H.Y.D.R.A.&#8217;s true nature and turned on them.

Now going by the name Spider-Woman, Jessica started her career as both a costumed crime fighter and a private detective.  In her later adventures, she engaged in a showdown with recurring villain [[Morgana Le Fey|Morgan Le Fey]] in the 6th century, died herself, was brought back to life, lost her powers, regained her powers, and was even trapped and later rescued from another dimension.  Jessica Drew's life settled down until a villain going by the name of Spider-Woman stole her power, which was later gained by the current Spider-Woman.  Jessica herself returned to her life as a private investigator along with being a teacher to the new Spider-Woman.

Jessica Drew has recently joined the [[Avengers_Disassembled|New Avengers]] in her old costume. 

'''Powers:''' super strength and endurance, stamina, speed, and agility, ability to stick to walls, an immunity to all toxic substances and radiations, and excessive bioelectricity, which could be released in powerful discharges "venom blast." 

'''Spider-Woman II:''''''(Julia Carpenter)''' A secretive government group called The Commission decided to use Julia as a test subject in their experiments.  The experiments were a success and Julia was granted powers very similar to Spider-Man.  Not long after adopting the identity of Spider-Woman she was drawn into the [[Secret Wars]].  The Alien [[symbiote]] that would join with Spider-Man and later became [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] was originally inspired by her costume.  After returning to earth Julia joined Freedom Force but much like her predecessor finding herself on the wrong side of the law turned sides.  She then found her place with the [[Avengers (comics)|West Coast Avengers]], and once they disbanded she joined the spin-off team [[Force Works]].  Julia&#8217;s main enemies were the Arachnid based team called Death Web.  Three super villains were originally created by The Commission using a variation of the same serum which transformed Julia.  Eventually Julia walked away form the hero business to concentrate on raising her daughter Rachael.  Julia was also attacked by the evil Spider-Woman, and her powers stolen.  In the aftermath, Julia is there if the new Spider-Woman needs advice but has happily returned to the life of a normal mother.

'''Powers:''' super strength and endurance, stamina, speed, and agility, ability to stick to walls (psionic based), Psi-Web: Psionic based webbing which takes much concentration to manifest but can be controlled in ways Spider-Man&#8217;s webbing never could.

'''Spider-Woman III:''' '''(Charlotte Witter)''' Charlotte Witter was a fashion designer (and granddaughter of psychic Madame Web) who also engaged into black market deals. Those dealings lead her to working for [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Octopus]]. Through genetic manipulation Dr. Octopus mutated her into a human/spider hybrid. He gave her the ability to absorb the powers of the previous Spider-Women in return for her destruction of Spider-Man.  She managed to steal the powers of Jessica Drew, Julia Carpenter, Mattie Franklin, and Madame Web.  During the climatic battle Mattie reabsorbed all those powers, leaving Charlotte powerless. In their last encounter it seems Charlotte&#8217;s powers have started to come back.  Nevertheless, Charlotte she was defeated by the current Spider-Woman and institutionalized.
