'''''Spider-Woman''''' is the codename of several fictional characters in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. They are based on the character [[Spider-Man]]. An earlier "Spider-Woman" was published by [[Harry "A" Chesler|Harry "A" Chesler Comics]] in 1941; a non-superpowered crime-fighter named Helen Goddard, she made her first and only appearance in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age comic book]] ''Major Victory #1''.
Another Spiderwoman was in Spidey Super Stories #11 (Story 3), though that is not official canon.

* [[Julia Carpenter]], a former [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] member, now called ''Arachne'' and a member of [[Omega Flight]].
* [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)]], who briefly impersonated Spider-Man before receiving her own short-lived comic series was active during the 2007 ''[[Loners]]'' miniseries.
* [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)]], the only villain to use the name.

==Alternate continuity== 
* A [[Spider-Woman (TV series)|''Spider-Woman'' animated series]] was based on the Jessica Drew version.
* Spider-Woman ([[Mary Jane Watson]]), [[ninja]] of the Spider-clan, is an alternate version of the character in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] reality.  
* Another version of Mary Jane as Spider-Woman can be found in the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' series. (See [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]]).
* In [[MC2]] continuity, Jessica Drew has never regained her powers and thus did not return to being Spider-Woman.

Though her creators named her Jessica Drew, she is a female [[Clone Saga#Ultimate Clone Saga|clone of Peter Parker]], and retains all of his memories up until the end of the Carnage storyline.
