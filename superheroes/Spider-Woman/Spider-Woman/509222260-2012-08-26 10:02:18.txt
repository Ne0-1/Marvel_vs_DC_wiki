'''Spider-Woman''' is the codename of several [[fictional]] characters in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
[[Marvel Comics]]' then-publisher [[Stan Lee]] said in 1978, shortly after Spider-Woman's debut in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #32 (Feb. 1977) and the start of the character's 50-issue self-titled series ([[cover-date]]d April 1978 - June 1983), that the character originated because,
{{bquote|I suddenly realized that some other company may quickly put out a book like that and claim they have the right to use the name, and I thought we'd better do it real fast to copyright the name. So we just batted one quickly, and that's exactly what happened. I wanted to protect the name, because it's the type of thing [where] someone else might say, 'Hey, why don't we put out a Spider-Woman; they can't stop us.' ... You know, years ago we brought out [[Wonder Man]], and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[DC Comics]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and ... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got [[Power Girl]] [after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Oh, boy. How unfair.<ref>"Hello, Culture Lovers: Stan the Map Raps with Marvel Maniacs at [[James Madison University]]", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #42, October 1978, p. 55</ref>}}

Following that initial ''Spider-Woman'' series, three more followed. Volume two was a [[miniseries]] published from November 1993 through February 1994; volume three was published from July 1999 through December 2000; and volume four, featuring Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, was published from November 2009 through May 2010.

==Spider-Women==
* [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], the original Spider-Woman, who left the role in the early 1980s. As of the late 2000s, she has returned to it. This version of the character starred in her own [[Spider-Woman (TV series)|animated TV series]] in 1979 (which is not to be confused with the similarly named ''[[Web Woman]]'' animated series of the same time period).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/webwoman.htm|title=Web Woman|accessdate=2011-09-29|publisher=Toonopedia}}</ref>
* [[Julia Carpenter]], a former member of the superhero teams the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Omega Flight]], who becomes Arachne and the second [[Madame Web]].
* [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]], who briefly impersonated [[Spider-Man]] before receiving her own short-lived comics series and appeared in the 2007 ''[[Loners]]'' [[miniseries]].
* [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Charlotte Witter]], a [[supervillain]] who used the name.
* [[Veranke]], queen of the shape-shifting extraterrestrial race the [[Skrull]]s, who impersonated Jessica Drew over a long period of time and was a founding member of the superhero team the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].

==Other versions==
* An unrelated earlier "Spider-Woman" was published by [[Harry "A" Chesler]]'s Dynamic Comics in 1944. She was a non-superpowered crime-fighter named Helen Goddard and made her first and only appearance in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[comic book]] ''Major Victory'' #1.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/3333/ ''Major Victory'' #1 (Dynamic Publications <nowiki>[1940s] [Chesler]</nowiki>, 1944 Series] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>
* Another "Spider-Woman" (who was non-canonical character, Valerie the Librarian) appeared in the [[live-action]], recurring skit "[[Spidey Super Stories]]" on the 1970s [[PBS]] [[children's television]] series '''[[The Electric Company]]'', on which [[Spider-Man]] appeared. She also appeared as Spider-Woman in the spin-off comic book series ''Spidey Super Stories'' #11 (August 1975). She had no superpowers.
* In the 1981 episode ''[[List of Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends episodes|The Triumph of the Green Goblin]]'' from the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' animated series, [[Firestar|Firestar (Angelica Jones)]] dresses as the Jessica Drew version of Spider-Woman at a costume party. The episode was adapted in the comic book ''Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends'' #1 (December 1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_amazing_friends/001.html|title=Comics : Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends #1|accessdate=2011-09-29|publisher=Spider Fans}}</ref> Similarly, ''Spidey Super Stories'' #56 (January 1982) features [[Mary Jane Watson]] dressed as the Jessica Drew version of Spider-Woman at a costume party. Both stories feature Peter Parker wearing [[Halloween costume]] versions of his traditional [[Spider-Man]] costume to the parties, as well as the [[Green Goblin]] interrupting both parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tasteslikecomics.com/2011/03/i-want-candy-spidey-super-stories-56/|title=I Want Candy: Spidey Super Stories #56|accessdate=2011-09-29|publisher=Tastes Like Comics}}</ref>
* Spider-Woman (portrayed by [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson#Mangaverse|Mary Jane Watson]] as a [[ninja]] of the Spider-clan), is an alternate version of the character in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] reality.
* Another version of [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson#Exiles|Mary Jane as Spider-Woman]] is featured in the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' series.
