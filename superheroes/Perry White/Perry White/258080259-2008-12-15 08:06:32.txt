'''Perry White''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in the ''[[Superman]]'' [[comic book|comics]]. White is the [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] [[newspaper]] the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.

White maintains very high journalistic standards. He is an archetypal image of the tough, irascible but fairminded boss. 

According to comic-book continuity, White was an award-winning journalist who served a term as Mayor of Metropolis. He worked as an assistant editor on the Metropolis ''Daily Star'' under George Taylor [http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=daily-star]  before becoming editor of the ''Planet''. 

==Media portrayals==
In the 1950s television and radio series, as played by [[John Hamilton (actor)|John Hamilton]], Perry typically barked "''Great [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ghost!''" when angry, exasperated or surprised. His other trademark line was "''Don't call me 'chief'!''" 

In ''[[Superman (film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', [[Jackie Cooper]] played Perry as a tough character who never let his reporters forget he had worked for the ''Planet'' nearly all his life. The "''don't call me 'chief'''" line was worked into a gag about ordering coffee, and became "''don't call me 'sugar'!''" (when he orders a coffee with sugar, and [[Jimmy Olsen]] calls him ''chief'' and he tells him not to call him "sugar"). Cooper's Perry was also fond of aphorisms such as "A good reporter doesn't get great stories - a good reporter makes them great."

In the 1990s television series ''[[Lois and Clark]]'', as played by [[Lane Smith]], Perry was a [[baby boomer]] with an abiding fondness for [[rock and roll]], particularly [[Elvis Presley]]. Instead of "Great Caesar's ghost," he sometimes said "''Great shades of Elvis!''"

Perry's other defining trait is a [[cigar]] habit. In the 1990s ''Superman'' comics, however, this practice was mostly discontinued, and a story was presented in which Perry undergoes treatment for [[lung cancer]]. 

Like [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Lois Lane]], Perry is also known for being an acquaintance of Superman.

In comic book continuity, Perry's wife is named Alice.

==Fictional character biography==
===Radio serial===
The character of Perry White was created for the radio serial, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', and he appeared in the second episode, which aired on February 14, 1940. The character transitioned into the ''Superman'' comic book later that year.

===Golden and Silver Age history===
The earliest ''Superman'' comics present [[Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane]] as working for the ''Daily Star'' for an editor named George Taylor. However, this was soon changed, with Perry White first appearing as the editor of a newly-renamed ''Daily Planet'' in 1940's ''Superman'' #7.

In the 1960s and 1970s DC Comics, after the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] method of continuity tracking was implemented, the above inconsistency was explained away by declaring that on Earth-One (the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] universe), Perry White is Clark and Lois' employer at the ''Daily Planet'', while on Earth-Two (the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] universe), George Taylor is that world's [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''Daily Star''. The Perry White of Earth-Two is a lead reporter for the ''Daily Star'' and has "filled in" from time to time, according to a ''[[Superman Family]]'' tale, as editor while Taylor was away. ''Superman Family'' also reveals that the Earth-Two Perry White loses his competition with Clark for the editor-in-chief opening after Taylor retires, however, he remains with the ''Star'' in his reporting capacity.

Prior to the changes detailed in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Perry begins his career as a freelance reporter for various newspapers, including a Chicago newspaper and [[Gotham City]]'s ''Gotham Gazette''. He eventually goes to work at the ''Daily Planet'' as a reporter, and earns his first [[Pulitzer Prize]] by being the first to write about [[Superboy]]'s [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origins, thanks to an exclusive interview with the Boy of Steel. 

Later still, Perry's reporting skills earn more praise after being the first to discover that [[Superboy]] has moved to Metropolis from [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] (Superboy had intended to keep his move quiet for an undefined period of time, so as not to alert anyone to Superboy and Clark Kent leaving Smallville around the same time). 

Finally, during Clark Kent's junior year of college, Perry is promoted to [[editor-in-chief]] of the newspaper, after the retirement of the paper's previous editor, the Earth-One version of George Taylor.

In the early 1970s, the ''Daily Planet'' is bought by [[Morgan Edge]], president of the media conglomerate Galaxy Communications, with much of Perry's power in running the paper overtaken by Edge. In the months just prior to the ''Crisis'' "reboot" in 1985, it is implied that Perry White is beginning to succumb to [[Alzheimer's disease]], manifesting in increased forgetfulness and confusion.

===Modern Age history===
With writer [[John Byrne]]'s post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' revamp of Superman's origin in the ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries and his subsequent Superman comics, Perry's history was fleshed out more fully.

Post-''Crisis'', Perry is born in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' [[Suicide Slum]] area, growing up with a father missing after heading off to war overseas. He becomes a copy boy at the ''Daily Planet'', beginning a lifetime career that will take him up the newspapers career ladder. Perry goes to school with [[Lex Luthor]] while they are children (Luthor also grows up in Suicide Slum).

After Luthor becomes a successful businessman, he begins diversifying his holdings in his newly-founded [[LexCorp]] company, which includes buying the ''Daily Planet''. Luthor soon sells it after deciding to pursue technology and television investments. Turning down an offer from Luthor to become part of Luthor's new [[television]] station WLEX, Perry finds an investor who saves the ''Daily Planet'' on the condition that Perry is promoted from reporter to editor. The entire episode, not the least of which is what Perry felt as having been forced out of his active writing career, leaves Perry bitter and angry with Luthor.

Perry marries Alice Spencer and has a son, [[Jerry White (comics)|Jerry White]]. Much later, after Jerry is fully grown, Perry learns that Lex Luthor is Jerry's biological father. Luthor briefly seduces Alice while Perry is overseas reporting on a war and thought to be killed. 

Perry White's two greatest moves as editor are hiring [[Lois Lane]] and (later) [[Clark Kent]]. When she was 15, Lois had impressed Perry with her persistence in trying to get employment at the newspaper (by lying about her age). After Jerry White dies from a gunshot, Perry and Alice grieve for some time, resulting in Perry taking a leave of absence from the ''Daily Planet''.

Later, Perry and Alice adopt an orphaned [[African-American]] boy named Keith Robert, who soon has his name changed to Keith Robert White. At about this time, Perry takes another leave of absence for [[lung cancer]] treatment, putting Clark Kent in charge as the ''Planet'''s temporary editor. After many grueling months of [[chemotherapy]], the cancer goes into remission. 

One of Perry's proudest moments is attending the wedding of Lois and Clark. He sits in the front row beside Lois' parents (Lois considers him as close a relative as her own family).

As the paper continues to struggle, the ''Planet'''s owner [[Franklin Stern]] sells the paper to Lex Luthor. Luthor, acting out of pure malice, dismantles the paper. He fires everyone except Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and two others who are relocated to Lexcom, Lex' new [[Internet]]-based news company. Fortunately, shortly thereafter, Lex sells on the ''Planet'' to [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] for [[$]]1 (thanks to a secret deal with Lois Lane). White is hired back as [[editor-in-chief]], and the entire former staff are hired back as well. Though Perry's knowledge of Clark's alter ego is uncertain, it is known that he has found a dusty suit of his star reporter's clothes in a supply closet, including his [[passport]]. For this reason, Perry may well suspect that Clark and Superman are the same person, but due to his personal admiration for both Clark and Superman, he has never confided this suspicion or knowledge to anybody. Bruce Wayne believes that because of White's superior skill as a reporter, he knows that Clark is Superman ("''Perry White is too good of a reporter not to have discovered Clark's identity, but he acts otherwise. It reminds me of [[Commissioner Gordon]] back home...''" -''[[Batman: Hush]]'').

Perry's editorship keeps the ''Daily Planet'' as one of the few newspapers that dare to heavily criticize Luthor (even after Luthor's successful election as [[President of the United States]]).

Because of the changes in Superman's history in recent years, including 2003-2004's miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright|Birthright]]'', much is not certain about Perry's history.

In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Lois and Perry are caught in an apparently fatal explosion triggered by [[Clayface]] at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. As of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #3, it was revealed that Perry is alive, but on life support.

*[[Pierre Watkin]] played Perry White in the [[movie serial|serials]] starring [[Kirk Alyn]].

*[[John Hamilton (actor)|John Hamilton]] played Perry White on the TV series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' starring [[George Reeves]]. In at least one episode, it is revealed that Perry has served a term as [[mayor]] of Metropolis before becoming editor-in-chief on the ''Planet''.

*In the four [[Superman film series|''Superman'' movies]] starring [[Christopher Reeve]], Perry White was played by actor [[Jackie Cooper]]. In the commentary track for ''Superman'', [[film director|director]] [[Richard Donner]] reveals that Cooper got the job because he had a passport, so he could arrive in a few hours from the call after [[Keenan Wynn]], who was originally cast, suffered a heart attack.
*[[Lane Smith]] played Perry White on the TV series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. In the series, his exclamation "''Great [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ghost!''" was replaced with "''Great shades of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]!''", and the comics briefly followed suit. In a subplot that carried over many episodes, Perry is portrayed as having marital difficulties with Alice due to his dedication to the paper. The couple later reunite just before the series finale. 

*He also appears in ''[[Super Friends]]'', in the episode "''Superfriends, Rest In Peace''" of ''[[Challenge Of The Superfriends]]'', when Superman tries to rescue him and Lois Lane, from Luthor and [[Solomon Grundy]]. 

*In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Perry White was voiced by [[George Dzundza]].

*In the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' episode "''[[Smallville (Season 3)#Perry|Perry]]''", Perry White was portrayed by [[Michael McKean]].

He attempts to regain some of his old reputation by exposing Clark's powers, but his plan backfires when sunspot activity temporarily nullifies Clark's abilities. It's later implied in "''[[Smallville (Season 4)#Gone|Gone]]''" that Perry is working his way back up with an article on Lionel's conviction.

*In [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[Superman Returns]]'', Perry White was originally going to be portrayed by [[Hugh Laurie]]. But when it was determined that there would be a schedule conflict involving Laurie's TV series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' (which is incidentally, executive produced by Singer), Laurie was forced to drop out and [[Frank Langella]] stepped in to play Perry White. In this movie, Perry has a nephew, [[Richard White (character)|Richard White]], who is engaged to Lois and serves as a father figure to her son Jason, although it is implied over the course of the film that Jason's biological father is Superman himself.

*Perry White's only video game appearances are ''[[Superman]]'' for the [[NES]] and ''[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]]'' for the [[GameCube]] and [[PlayStation 2]].

*In ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'' Perry White is voiced by [[Ray Wise]].

*Perry White's nephew, T. J. White, is a supporting character in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' television series.

==Comparisons to J. Jonah Jameson==
Because of several factors in White's life &mdash; his profession, some of his personal habits, and the fact that one of the stars of his staff is secretly a costumed superhero &mdash; [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the aggressive editor-in-chief of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' newspaper featured in [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics']] ''[[Spider-Man]]'' stories, has often been compared to Perry White. However, compared to Jameson, White is a much more easy-going man (despite White's gruff demeanor and his high devotion to his newspaper); additionally, White also displays a great deal more affection for his city's primary superhero than Jameson does for Spider-Man.

Notably, the two of them do tend to agree on one central characteristic: a certain distrust for people who wear masks. Since Superman does not wear a mask and Spider-Man does, they can be considered as having divergent conflicts beyond that point.

In the ''[[Marvel vs DC]]'' crossover, Jameson is (temporarily) in charge of the ''Daily Planet''. He ignores the ''Planet'''s "no smoking" policy. Later, Perry White returns and he and Jonah confront the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] after he buys the ''Daily Planet'', with [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] tackling the Kingpin after he throws Perry off to one side when Perry and Jameson try to stand up to him.
