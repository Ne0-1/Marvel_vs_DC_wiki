'''Perry White''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in the ''[[Superman]]'' [[comic book|comics]]. White is the [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] [[newspaper]] the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.

White maintains very high ethical and journalistic standards.  He is an archetypal image of the tough, irascible but fairminded boss. White's most well known [[catchphrase]]s are "Great Caesar's ghost!" and "Don't call me chief!"

According to [[post-Crisis]] comic-book continuity, White was an award-winning journalist who served a term as Mayor of Metropolis. He worked as an assistant editor on the Metropolis ''Daily Star'' under George Taylor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=daily-star |title="Who's Who in the Superman Comics: The Daily Star," The Superman Homepage |publisher=Supermanhomepage.com |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>  before becoming editor of the ''Planet''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Radio serial===
The character of Perry White was created for the radio serial, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' and portrayed by actor Julian Noa.  The character made his initial appearance in the second episode of the series, which aired February 14, 1940.  The character transitioned into the ''Superman'' comic book later that year.

===Golden and Silver Age history===
The earliest ''Superman'' comics present [[Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane]] as working for the ''Daily Star'' for an editor named George Taylor. However, this was soon changed, with Perry White first appearing as the editor of a newly-renamed ''Daily Planet''.<ref>''Superman'' (volume 1) #7 (November-December 1940)</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s DC Comics, after the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] method of continuity tracking was implemented, the above inconsistency was explained away by declaring that on Earth-One (the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] universe), Perry White is Clark and Lois' employer at the ''Daily Planet'', while on Earth-Two (the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] universe), George Taylor is that world's [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''Daily Star''. The Perry White of Earth-Two is a lead reporter for the ''Daily Star'' and, according to a ''[[Superman Family]]'' tale,  has "filled in" as editor from time to time while Taylor was away.

Prior to the changes detailed in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Perry begins his career as a freelance reporter for various newspapers, including a Chicago newspaper<ref>''Superman'' (volume 1) #142 (January 1961)</ref> and [[Gotham City]]'s ''Gotham Gazette''.<ref>''World's Finest Comics'' #80 (January-February 1956)</ref> He eventually goes to work at the ''Daily Planet'' as a reporter, and earns his first [[Pulitzer Prize]] by being the first to write about [[Superboy]]'s [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origins, thanks to an exclusive interview with the Boy of Steel.<ref>''New Adventures of Superboy'' #12 (December 1980)</ref>

Later still, Perry's reporting skills earn more praise after being the first to discover that Superboy has moved to Metropolis from [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]]. (Superboy had intended to keep his move quiet for an undefined period of time, so as not to alert anyone to Superboy and Clark Kent leaving Smallville around the same time.)<ref>''Superman'' (volume 1) #366 (December 1981)</ref>

Finally, during Clark Kent's junior year of college, Perry is promoted to editor-in-chief of the newspaper, after the retirement of the paper's previous editor, the Earth-One version of George Taylor.<ref>''Superman: The Secret Years'' #4 (May 1985)</ref>

In the early 1970s, the ''Daily Planet'' is bought by [[Morgan Edge]], president of the media conglomerate Galaxy Communications, with much of Perry's power in running the paper overtaken by Edge.<ref>''Superman'' (volume 1) #233 (January 1971)</ref> In the months just prior to the ''Crisis'' "reboot" in 1985, it is implied that Perry White is beginning to succumb to [[Alzheimer's disease]], manifesting in increased forgetfulness and confusion.

===Modern Age history===
With writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' revamp of Superman's origin in the ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|Man of Steel]]'' miniseries and his subsequent Superman comics, Perry's history was fleshed out more fully.

Post-''Crisis'', Perry is born in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' [[Suicide Slum]] area, growing up with a father missing after heading off to war overseas. He becomes a copy boy at the ''Daily Planet'', beginning a lifetime career that will take him up the newspaper's career ladder. Perry goes to school with [[Lex Luthor]] while they are children (Luthor was also born in Suicide Slum).

After Luthor becomes a successful businessman, he begins diversifying his holdings in his newly-founded [[LexCorp]] company, which includes buying the ''Daily Planet''. Luthor soon sells it after deciding to pursue technology and television investments. Turning down an offer from Luthor to become part of Luthor's new [[television]] station WLEX, Perry finds an investor who saves the ''Daily Planet'' on the condition that Perry is promoted from reporter to managing editor. The entire episode, not the least of which is what Perry felt as having been forced out of his active writing career, leaves Perry bitter and angry with Luthor.

Perry marries Alice Spencer and has a son, Jerry White. Much later, after Jerry is fully grown, Perry learns that Lex Luthor is Jerry's biological father. Luthor briefly seduces Alice while Perry is overseas reporting on a war and thought to be killed.

Perry White's two greatest moves as editor are hiring [[Lois Lane]] and (later) [[Clark Kent]]. When she was 15, Lois had impressed Perry with her persistence in trying to get employment at the newspaper (by lying about her age). After Jerry White dies from a gunshot, Perry and Alice grieve for some time, resulting in Perry taking a leave of absence from the ''Daily Planet''.

Later, Perry and Alice adopt an orphaned [[African-American]] boy named Keith Robert Parks, who soon has his name changed to Keith Robert White. At about this time, Perry takes another leave of absence for [[lung cancer]] treatment, putting Clark Kent in charge as the ''Planet'''s temporary editor. After many grueling months of [[chemotherapy]], the cancer goes into remission.

One of Perry's proudest moments is attending the wedding of Lois and Clark. He sits in the front row beside Lois' parents (Lois considers him as close a relative as her own family).<ref>''Superman: The Wedding Album'' (December 1996)</ref>

As the paper continues to struggle, the ''Planet'''s owner [[Franklin Stern]] sells the paper to Lex Luthor. Luthor, acting out of pure malice, dismantles the paper. He fires everyone except Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and two others who are relocated to Lexcom, Lex' new [[Internet]]-based news company. Fortunately, shortly thereafter, Lex sells on the ''Planet'' to [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] for $1 (thanks to a secret deal with Lois Lane). White is hired back as editor-in-chief, and the entire former staff are hired back as well. 

Though Perry's knowledge of Clark's alter ego is uncertain, it is known that he has found a dusty suit of his star reporter's clothes in a supply closet, including his [[passport]]. For this reason, Perry may well suspect that Clark and Superman are the same person, but due to his personal admiration for both Clark and Superman, he has never confided this suspicion or knowledge to anybody. Bruce Wayne believes that because of White's superior skill as a reporter, he knows that Clark is Superman ("''Perry White is too good a reporter not to have uncovered Clark's secret. And yet, he acts otherwise... reminding me how good a detective [[Commissioner Gordon|Jim Gordon]] is back in Gotham City...''" -''[[Batman: Hush]]'').

Perry's editorship keeps the ''Daily Planet'' as one of the few newspapers that dare to heavily criticize Luthor (even after Luthor's successful election as [[President of the United States]]).

Because of the changes in Superman's history in recent years, including 2003-2004's miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright|Birthright]]'', much is not certain about Perry's history.

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #2, Lois and Perry are caught in an apparently fatal explosion triggered by [[Clayface]] at the ''Daily Planet''. As of ''Final Crisis'' #3, it was revealed that Perry is alive, but on life support.  Perry has since then recovered however, and is now back to running the paper.

When the world begins to grow increasingly more paranoid towards the new population of Kryptonians, Lois begins to investigate the conspiracies executed by the US Government, and her father [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Lane]] in particular. However the government becomes aware of Lois' actions, and attempt to shut her down. As a result, Perry is unable to print any of Lois' stories because of General Lane's power. Unwilling to let this slide, Perry suggests that Lois 'quit' the paper so as to continue her investigation.<ref>''Action Comics'' #884 (February 2010)</ref>

==Other Versions==
===DC Universe Online: Legends===
In the limited comic series, [[DC Universe Online: Legends]], Perry White was captured, along side Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, in the Daily Planet by Brainiac, but was saved by Superman, with Lex Luthor in possession of the canister containing them.<ref>''DC Universe Online Legends'' #2 (April 2011)</ref><ref>''DC Universe Online Legends'' #9 (August 2011)</ref> Later, Perry became one of the people who have gained metahuman abilities from Braniac's Exobytes, transforming his body into a being of Ice and granting him Ice powers, which has surprised him.<ref>''DC Universe Online Legends'' #10 (August 2011)</ref> Later he adopted the code name ''Frost''.<ref>''DC Universe Online Legends'' #20 (February 2012)</ref>

==In other media==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}

=== Live action ===
====Kirk Alyn serials and ''The Adventures of Superman''====
[[Pierre Watkin]] was the first actor that played Perry White, in the two Superman serials starring [[Kirk Alyn]] from 1948 and 1950. In the 1950s television and radio series, as played by [[John Hamilton (actor)|John Hamilton]], Perry typically barked "''Great [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ghost!''" when angry, exasperated or surprised. His other trademark line was "''Don't call me 'chief'!''" Both of these lines eventually became staples in the comics. In at least one episode, it is revealed that Perry has served a term as [[mayor]] of Metropolis before becoming editor-in-chief on the ''Planet''.

====Christopher Reeve films====
In the 1978 film ''[[Superman (film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' (and its [[Superman in film|three sequels from the 1980s]]), [[Jackie Cooper]] played Perry as a tough character, who never let his reporters forget he had worked for the ''Planet'' nearly all his life. The "''don't call me 'chief'''" line was worked into a gag about ordering coffee, and became "''don't call me 'sugar'!''" (when he orders a coffee with sugar, and [[Jimmy Olsen]] calls him ''chief'' and he tells him not to call him "sugar"). Cooper's Perry was also fond of aphorisms such as "A good reporter doesn't get great stories — a good reporter makes them great." In the commentary track for ''Superman'', [[film director|director]] [[Richard Donner]] reveals that Cooper got the role because he had a passport, and thus was able to be on set in a few hours, after [[Keenan Wynn]], who was originally cast, suffered a heart attack.

====''Superboy''====
Perry White's son, T. J. White, was a supporting character in the ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' television series. Perry White himself never appeared in the show; however, he did appear in the second issue of the tie-in comic book series, in which T.J. was kidnapped by an organized crime family on which Perry did an exposé.

====''Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman''====
In the 1990s television series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', as played by [[Lane Smith]], Perry was a [[Baby Boomer]] with an abiding fondness for [[rock and roll]], particularly [[Elvis Presley]]. Instead of "Great Caesar's ghost," he sometimes said "Great shades of Elvis!" and the comics briefly followed suit. In a subplot that carried over many episodes, Perry is portrayed as having marital difficulties with his wife Alice due to his dedication to the paper. The couple later reunite just before the series finale.

====''Smallville''====
''[[Smallville]]'', the successful TV series about the life of a younger Clark Kent before being Superman, featured their version of the character. In the season-three episode "''[[Smallville (Season 3)#Perry|Perry]]''", Perry is portrayed by [[Michael McKean]]. In this, he is a former ''Daily Planet'' reporter who gets reduced to [[tabloid television]] after attempting to expose [[Lionel Luthor]]'s corrupt dealings. He attempts to regain some of his old reputation by exposing Clark's powers, but his plan backfires when sunspot activity temporarily nullifies Clark's abilities, although Clark's subsequent heroism despite his currently-powerless status prompts Perry to both abandon the idea that Clark has powers and cause him to consider turning over a new leaf, even offering to give Clark a recommendation if he looks into journalism as a career in future. The phrase ''"don't call me Chief"'' was worked into this episode, when White calls Sheriff Nancy Adams "Chief".

It's later implied in the season 4 episode "[[Smallville (Season 4)#Gone|Gone]]" that Perry is working his way back up with an article on Lionel's conviction.

He reprised his role in the season 9 episode "Hostage" as the new boyfriend of the returning Martha Kent, who had moved to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. In the series finale, it is shown that Perry White became the editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet.  Michael McKean provided the voice of Perry White in the very last scene of the final episode but the actor himself wasn't seen on screen.

====''Saturday Night Live''====
Michael McKean also played Perry White in a Superman spoof on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

====''Superman Returns''====
In [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[Superman Returns]]'', Perry White was originally going to be portrayed by [[Hugh Laurie]]. But when it was determined that there would be a schedule conflict involving Laurie's TV series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' (which was, incidentally, executive produced by Singer), Laurie was forced to drop out and [[Frank Langella]] stepped in to play Perry White. In this movie, Perry has a nephew, Richard White, who is engaged to Lois and serves as a father figure to her son Jason, although it is implied over the course of the film that Jason's biological father is Superman himself.

====''Man of Steel''====
[[Laurence Fishburne]] will portray Perry White in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', making him the first African American to play Perry White in a live action film .<ref>{{cite web|last=Ditzian |first=Eric |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1668388/laurence-fishburne-superman-man-of-steel.jhtml |title='Man Of Steel' Taps Laurence Fishburne As News Chief Perry White - MTV Movie News |publisher=MTV |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> The film is scheduled for theatrical release on June 14, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/zack_snyders_superman_film_man_of_steel_moves_to_a_june_14_2013_date/ |title=Zack Snyder's Superman Film ''Man Of Steel'' Moves To June 14, 2013 |work=[[indieWire]] |last=Davis |first=Edward |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>

=== Animation ===
The Superman Fleischer cartoons from the 1940s featured a Daily Planet editor without name, because at the time Perry White was used in the radio serial and George Taylor was featured in the comics.

The 1966 series ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]'' featured the talented [[Jackson Beck]] providing the voice of the character.

Perry also appears in ''[[Super Friends]]'', in the episode "Superfriends, Rest In Peace" of ''[[Challenge Of The Superfriends]]'', when Superman tries to rescue him and Lois Lane from Luthor and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]].

The [[Superman (1988 TV series)|Superman 1988 TV series]] showed a Perry White modeled after his comic book counterpart but with a tough attitude, similar to the movie series, and was voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]].

====DC animated universe====
The 1990s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' featured Perry White played by voice-actor [[George Dzundza]], that only interacted with the characters in the Daily Planet. This version of the character had cameos in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series. Dzundza reprised his role as Perry White in the video game ''[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]]'' and in the 2006 direct-to-video animated film ''[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]''.
