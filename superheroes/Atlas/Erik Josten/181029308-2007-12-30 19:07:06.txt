'''Atlas''' ('''Erik Josten'''), formerly '''Power Man''', '''Smuggler''' and '''Goliath''', is a [[fictional character]], a former [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

==Fictional character biography==

Erik Josten was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].  He was originally a mercenary who was convinced by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] to undergo the same 'ionic-ray' treatment (from a machine invented by [[Baron Zemo]]) as [[Wonder Man]], making Josten super-strong. Taking the name Power Man, he became the Enchantress's partner for a while, but later struck out on his own. He became a professional supervillain, joining such teams as the [[Lethal Legion]] and the [[Masters of Evil]]. 

Eventually, Josten met [[Luke Cage]], a hero who for a brief time had assumed the name Power Man. The two fought; Cage won. 

Josten's powers were greatly reduced when [[Count Nefaria]] stole them (along with those of his other superhuman underlings.) His strength fading, he changed his costume and became a smuggler, taking the unimaginative name [[Smuggler (comics)|the Smuggler]].

Later, he gained the ability to grow to giant size from the criminal Doctor [[Karl Malus]], who used a sample of [[Henry Pym]]'s growth serum. He then took on the name '''Goliath''', a name used previously by [[superheroes]] (see [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]], [[Black Goliath]]) and again changed his costume. Using this ability, he was sent by Dr. Doom to kill Spider-Man, but, thanks to the hero's newly-acquired cosmic powers, Goliath was defeated.

Josten joined a new version of the Masters of Evil, founded by the second Baron Zemo. During his time with this group, Josten was one of the villains who invaded Avengers Mansion and beat [[Hercules (comics)|Hercules]] severely <!--phrase "nearly to death" requires explanation, as he's a demigod-->. When Zemo decided to disguise the Masters as a superhero team called The [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Josten created the original identity (and costume) of Atlas. However, like most of the Thunderbolts, Atlas began to enjoy public admiration, and eventually reformed to become a genuine superhero, even after the Thunderbolts' criminal past was publicly revealed. After absorbing the energy from one of Nefaria's weapons, an "ionic bomb", Josten mutated into an "ionic energy creature" similar to what Wonder Man had become. In this form, he came to inhabit the body of [[Dallas Riordan]], a woman he loved. 

When they were separated, Dallas took the ionic energy, leaving Josten powerless, a situation which lasted until [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] gave him a new dose of Pym particles.  This lasted until the end of the ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' limited series, when Erik asked Henry Pym to remove the particles from his system.

However, he regained the ability to change his size, by reclaiming the ionic energy from Dallas, leaving her a paraplegic again.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #1</ref>

Altered again by the Wellspring, during a battle against [[Grandmaster (comics)|the Grandmaster]] in which he had to surrender his powers temporarily to Zemo, he was left stuck in a giant form, too heavy even to move and communicate. However he was able to send back some ionic energy to Dallas, restoring her legs.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
Atlas appears alongside the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in the Dead Days one-shot of the [[Marvel Zombies]] miniseries attacking [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].  He is seen in one panel being hit in the face with Thor's mighty hammer, under the assumption that it destroyed Atlas as he was no longer seen in the Marvel Zombies miniseries.
