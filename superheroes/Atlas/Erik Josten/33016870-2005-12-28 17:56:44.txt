:''This article is about the Marvel Comics character Atlas. For the comics companies of that name, see [[Atlas Comics (1950s)]] or [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]]''.

'''Atlas''' (Erik Josten, formerly '''Power Man''', '''Smuggler''' and '''Goliath''') is a [[fictional character]], a former [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

Josten was originally a mercenary who was convinced by [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|The Enchantress]] to undergo the same 'ionic-ray' treatment (from a machine invented by [[Baron Zemo]]) that [[Wonder Man]] did, making him super-strong. Taking the name Power Man, he became The Enchantress's partner for a while, but later struck out on his own. He became a professional supervillain, even joining groups like the [[Lethal Legion]] and the [[Masters of Evil]]. During his time with the Masters of Evil, Josten was one of the villains who invaded the Avengers mansion and beat Hercules nearly to death.

Eventually, Josten met [[Luke Cage]], a hero who had assumed the same name. The two fought, but Cage won. 

Josten's powers were greatly reduced when [[Count Nefaria]] stole them (along those of the his other superhuman underlings.) His strength fading, he changed his costume and became a smuggler, taking the name The Smuggler.

Later, he gained the ability to grow to giant size from the criminal [[Doctor Malus]], who used a sample of [[Henry Pym]]'s growth serum. He then took on the name Goliath, a name used previously by super heroes (see [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]], [[Black Goliath]]) and again changed his costume.

Josten joined a new version of the Masters of Evil, founded by the second Baron Zemo. When Zemo decided to disguise the Masters as a superhero team called The [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Josten created the original identity (and costume) of Atlas.

However, like most of the Thunderbolts, Atlas decided to reform and become a true superhero, even after the truth was revealed to the public. After absorbing the energy from one of Zemo's weapons, an "ionic bomb", Josten mutated into a "ionic energy creature" similar to the one Wonder Man had become. In this form he came to inhabit the body of Dallas Riordan, a woman he loved. However he's now back to being a size-shifter.

Atlas is currently still a heroic member of the Thunderbolts.
