==Fictional character biography==
<!--Gwen Stacy was NOT Peter's first love, it was Betty Brant. Anyone who has actually read the comics knows this. Please keep fanon out of this article.-->
Betty Brant was born in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Her mother had originally been the "[[Girl Friday (idiom)|Girl Friday]]" of ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and Betty dropped out of high school to become Jameson's secretary at the ''Daily Bugle''. As [[Peter Parker]]'s very first love,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #142</ref> she met him when he became a freelance photographer for the ''Bugle''.<ref name="ASP4"/> After they had been attacked by [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|the Vulture]], Peter had already noticed his attraction to Betty, and was impressed when she stood up to Jameson over publishing slandering articles against Spider-Man. They began dating shortly afterwards, when Betty was impressed by Parker's kindness when taking care of his ill [[Aunt May]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #9</ref>

Her secretarial job at the ''Bugle'' was taken to help her brother attorney Bennett Brant pay back his gambling debts,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #11</ref> which he had acquired trying to pay for their Mother's medical bills. Bennett had become friendly with Betty's then boyfriend Gordon Savinski.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #12</ref> Gordon was into many illegal activities and Bennett eventually took on a gambling debt that he couldn't pay back to a gangster named Blackie Gaxton. When Blackie's thugs came looking for Bennett at the family home, Betty's mother was knocked into a coffee table, resulting in permanent [[brain damage]].

With the help of [[Doctor Octopus]], Blackie Gaxton kidnapped both Bennett and Betty as insurance against anyone preventing him leaving the country. Bennett was double crossed when Glaxton refused to free him of his debts and was fatally shot during a melee between Glaxton's gang, Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man. At first, Betty blamed Spider-Man for the death of her brother and told Spider-Man that she never wanted to see him again, although afterwards she realized she had been wrong and that he had only been trying to help. The blossoming romance between Betty and Peter was cut short, when Betty feared that Peter cared more for his classmate [[Liz Allan]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13</ref> This misunderstanding led to their relationship finally coming to an end.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #17</ref>

===Ned Leeds===
Soon after Peter and Betty's break up, she started dating fellow ''Daily Bugle'' employee reporter [[Ned Leeds]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #18</ref> Even though he soon left for [[Europe]], they remained in contact, writing each other letters regularly.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #23-24</ref> Upon his return, they began dating again,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #29</ref> and Leeds eventually proposed to Betty. There were signs that Betty still loved Peter and Peter did his best to alienate her for her own good.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #30</ref> She eventually accepted Leeds' marriage proposal.

After their engagement, J. Jonah Jameson threw an engagement party at his penthouse apartment and their wedding soon followed. Their wedding day was not all smooth sailing as a costumed criminal named Mirage decided to rob all the guests at the top weddings on that day. Spider-Man intervened and Mirage was easily captured. Betty and Ned were married with [[Mary Jane Watson]] serving as Betty's maid of honor.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #156</ref>

Soon after their wedding, Jameson sent both Betty and Ned off to [[Paris]], [[France]] on an all expenses paid working honeymoon. Betty began to notice a change in Ned as he became consumed by work. While Ned covered an insurrection in [[Cyprus]] she flew back to New York to the consoling arms of Peter.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #184</ref> After discovering Betty's disappearance Ned returned to New York and confronted both Peter and Betty. Ned punched Peter in the jaw and tried to force him to never see Betty again. Peter said he never wanted to see either of them again and that he was only interested in Betty to make Mary Jane jealous, in the hope that this would bring Ned and Betty back together.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #195</ref>

After that, the villain [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] marks Betty for death, but she escapes his murder attempt.<ref>"Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man" #107 (December 1985)</ref>

Ned's investigative reporting brought an incredible strain on the Leeds' marriage. Following leads on the mysterious new villain named [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Leeds was captured and hypnotized to think that he was the Hobgoblin. During this period Betty turned to her friend [[Flash Thompson]], but he too was framed by the real Hobgoblin and in the process Betty saw Ned dressed as the Hobgoblin threatening Flash. Her mind, already fragile, was pushed over the edge. Meanwhile, a mercenary named [[Jason Macendale]] asked the Foreigner for information on who the Hobgoblin was and was given Leeds' name. When Ned followed an espionage story to [[Berlin]], under hypnosis he dressed himself as the Hobgoblin and was assassinated by the Foreigner's men. Macendale after thinking the original Hobgoblin was dead, would later adopt the identity of the Hobgoblin for himself.

Betty suffered a complete mental breakdown after the news of Ned's death by the Foreigner,<ref>"Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine" (Feb. 1987)</ref> and believed him to still be alive. In her state a young recruiter from the [[Cult]] of Love was able to persuade her to join their faction under a leader called the Teacher where she was programmed in their ways.<ref>"Web Of Spider-Man" #40 (July 1988)</ref> The Teacher turned out to be a con artist. Flash and Spider-Man figured this out and saved Betty, though she lost everything she owned and had to take up residence with Flash Thompson. During this, the demonic events of ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' happened, overwhelming much of New York City. Betty and Flash were attacked by demonic duplicates of Spider-Man and Ned. Betty overcame physical and psychological barriers and succeeded in destroying the monsters.<ref>"Spectacular Spider-Man" #148 (March 1989)</ref>

After these difficult times, she returned to work at the ''Daily Bugle'' as a secretary under the city editor Kate Cushing. A change in Betty occurred when she became an investigative reporter who successfully tracked down the Foreigner and his assassins and found out the real identity of the Hobgoblin which finally put her mind at rest. She has now become one of the top investigative reporters at the ''Bugle''.

===Deadline===
In ''[[Deadline (Marvel Comics)|Deadline]]'', during her time at the ''Bugle'', she became friends with [[Kat Farrell]] and pushed her to take on the Judge Hart case in order to get a better job at the ''Bugle''.<ref>''Deadline'' #1</ref> She kept a spare key to Kat's apartment in her desk, which fellow reporter Paul Swanson used to break into Kat's apartment in an attempt to scare her off the case.<ref>''Deadline'' #4</ref>

===Brand New Day===
In [[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'s storyline, Betty became a reporter under [[Dexter Bennett]] after Jameson's [[heart attack]] forced his wife to sell the ''Daily Bugle'' to him, and she became the only one of the old circle to remain working at the ''Bugle''. As Dexter was trying to sidestep Betty and make her his "Girl Friday" again, Peter drops hints of a fake family relationship between Betty and the deceased actor [[Marlon Brando]], bolstering her position in Bennett's eye as a gossip reporter.

Recently, she celebrated her birthday and asked Peter to organize for her friends to come over for a dinner, but due to her work at the new ''DB'', nobody feels like befriending her. In fact, only Peter showed up at her birthday, because he was the only one of her friends that was not angry with her. Initially, Betty was furious at Peter, angrily accusing him of ruining her night until he tells her the truth. She is sad, but he reassures her that everyone will forgive her soon. Betty realizes that Peter really is her best friend.<ref name="amazingspider1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Waid]] | Penciller = [[Barry Kitson]] | Inker = Mark Farmer| Story = Platonic | Title = [[The Amazing Spider-Man]]|Issue = 583 | Date =  January 2009| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Betty Brant is again the loyal secretary of J. Jonah Jameson at the ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man #8</ref> She's a headstrong woman, trying to get by in life and having as much fun on dates as she can get. This version has a considerably different personality as she goes as far as making bets about the deaths of missing co-workers. She also lacks her mainstream counterpart's brown bob hairstyle and instead sporting long black hair (but her design was not concrete at the beginning of the series). She worked herself up into a rage while trying to build the ''Bugle'' website to which Peter Parker took over from her and got his job at the ''Bugle'' as a webdesigner.

Jameson rejects her request to find out more about the disappearance of [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]], alleging that a brief affair with [[Kraven the Hunter]] before his arrest proves that she is incapable of any reporting assignment beyond covering college fashion shows.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #121</ref> Sometime after the original [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'s death, Betty later gets the footage of the new [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] stopping some muggers and presents this to Jameson. The story of a new Spider-Man makes the headlines.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #6</ref> Betty is subsequently killed by [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] after trying to expose the new Spider-Man's identity.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), [[David Marquez (comics)|Marquez, David]] (a).

In "[[What If (comics)|What If]] the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?", Betty is one of three candidates - along with [[Flash Thompson]] and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] - who is bitten by the radioactive spider which gave [[Spider-Man]] his powers. After confiding in Peter, and with his assistance, she begins to fight crime under the name "The Amazing Spider-Girl", with a mask similar to Spider-Man's but a very different costume. One time, she fails to stop a certain [[Burglar (comics)|crook]], who subsequently murders Peter's uncle [[Uncle Ben|Ben]]. The shock over the consequences of her failure makes Betty quit her Spider-Girl identity, although Peter takes up the identity of Spider-Man later on by synthetically recreating and ingesting the irradiated spider's venom.<ref>''What If?''

* Betty Brant appears as a minor character in the [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|original feature film series]], portrayed by [[Elizabeth Banks]]. Betty appears in all three films in the series, starting with ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and reappearing in its sequels, ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. As one of the ''Bugle'' staff and J. Jonah Jameson's secretary, Betty is usually seen either passing on messages to Jonah or receiving curt orders from him. While she never dates Peter Parker, a subtle attraction to him is apparent in the first two films. In ''Spider-Man 3'', Betty seems to have found a way of getting her comeuppance on her boss, by being tasked by his wife to inform him to avoid getting agitated and to remember to take his numerous medications, which she does to comic effect through a loud buzzer/intercom; later, she is hit on by [[Eddie Brock|Eddie Brock, Jr.]] (with whom she wants nothing to do) and a symbiote-influenced Peter Parker (to whom she is visibly attracted), only to be interrupted by Jameson, who says "''That's not the position I hired you for!''"
