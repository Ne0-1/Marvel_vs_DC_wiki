'''Betty Brant''' is a character in the [[Spider-Man]] [[comic book]] series. She appeared early in Spider-Man mythology, in the fourth issue of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as the secretary for [[J. Jonah Jameson]], [[Peter Parker]]'s boss. She became a love interest for Peter Parker. Their relationship eventually ended, and she married [[Ned Leeds]]. 

Later on in the series, it became clear that Ned Leeds was in fact the villain [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], although this fact was later [[retcon]]ned into Ned's having been a pawn of the ''real'' Hobgoblin. This revelation, coupled with Ned's death, sent Brant over the edge into insanity. Eventually, the character recovered, and rejoined the staff of the [[Daily Bugle]] as an investigative reporter whose newfound courageous assertiveness and investigative skill impressed her colleages. She remains a recurring character in the Spider-Man comics.

The character has also appeared in the Spider-Man [[animated series]] and [[Spider-Man (movie)|film]].
