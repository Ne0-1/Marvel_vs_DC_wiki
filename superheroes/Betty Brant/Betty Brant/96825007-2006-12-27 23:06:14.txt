'''Betty Brant''' is a [[supporting character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]’ [[Spider-Man]] series. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], she first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 ([[1963#September|September 1963]])

She was originally portrayed as the personal secretary for ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and a romantic interest of Peter Parker, Spider-Man’s [[alter ego]] who works as a ''Bugle'' photographer.

She subsequently enters into a disastrous marriage with [[Ned Leeds]], a ''Daily Bugle'' reporter. After Leeds’ death and many years of turmoil, she emerges as a top reporter for the ''Bugle''.

Her appearance may have been inspired by [[Flo Steinberg]], who worked for Marvel Comics at the time as a secretary for Stan Lee.

==History==
Betty's mother had originally been Jameson's "girl Friday" and Betty took the position after her mother's death. Peter Parker (secretly Spider-Man) and she were attracted to each other because Betty wanted a normal, ordinary man, and they were romantically linked. However, her brother was accidentally murdered during a fight with Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, and she blamed Spider-Man. A year later, Betty broke up with Peter, and she eventually married ''Bugle'' reporter Ned Leeds.

However the marriage proved turbulent as Ned was often posted overseas. When he was stationed in [[Paris]] she found the life impossible and left Ned to return to New York. She turned to Peter Parker once more and the two had a brief affair. However Ned followed her home and she was caught between the two men. Peter regretted getting involved with Betty again and allowed the affair to break abruptly, driving her back into the arms of Ned.

Later on in the series, it became clear that Ned Leeds was in fact the villain [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], although this fact was later [[retcon]]ned into Ned's having been a pawn of the ''real'' Hobgoblin. As Leeds became more hostile, Betty drifted into the arms of old friend [[Flash Thompson]]. A jealous Leeds framed Thompson as the Hobgoblin, but when the two battled, the Hobgoblin's mask slipped, and Betty discovered that Ned and the Hobgoblin were one and the same. This revelation, coupled with Ned's murder by the Foreigner, sent Brant over the edge into insanity. 

Betty joined the Students of Love [[cult]], led by the Teacher, before being saved by Flash and Spider-Man. Flash and Betty drifted apart as Betty recovered. She rejoined the staff of the [[Daily Bugle]] as an investigative reporter whose newfound courageous assertiveness and investigative skill impressed her colleagues. She finally cleared Ned's name when she revealed that [[Roderick Kingsley]] was the real Hobgoblin. She remains a recurring character in the Spider-Man comics.

==Ultimate Betty==
In the ''Ultimate Marvel'' universe, Betty Brant is once again the loyal secretary of J. Jonah Jameson at the Daily Bugle. She's a headstrong woman, trying to get by in life and having as much fun on dates as she can get. She first appeared in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #8.

== Other media ==
The character has appeared in the Spider-Man [[Spider-Man (1960s animation)|1960s animated series]], voiced by [[Peg Dixon]], where she was a prominent [[supporting character]] much in manner of [[Lois Lane]].  As Betty Brant receded into the background in the comics in favor of other love interests, particularly [[Mary Jane Watson]], she appears as a much more minor character such as in the  [[Spider-Man (movie)|feature film]] series as played by [[Elizabeth Banks]]. 

Elizabeth Banks reappeared in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' as Betty, and will reappear in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. However she most likely will not begin dating Peter, since he already will be involved in the love triangle with [[Mary Jane Watson]] and [[Gwen Stacy]].
