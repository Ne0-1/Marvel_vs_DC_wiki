'''Betty Brant''' is a character in the [[Spider-Man]] [[comic book]] series. She appeared early in Spider-Man mythology, in the fourth issue of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as the personal secretary for [[J. Jonah Jameson]], Peter Parker's boss, a job previously held by her mother. She became a love interest for Peter Parker. Their relationship eventually ended, and she married [[Ned Leeds]], a ''Daily Bugle'' reporter.

However the marriage proved turbulent as Ned was often posted overseas. When he was stationed in [[Paris]] she found the life impossible and left Ned to return to New York. She turned to Peter Parker once more and the two had a brief affair. However Ned followed her home and she was caught between the two men. Peter regretted getting involved with Betty again and allowed the affair to break abruptly, driving her back into the arms of Ned.

Later on in the series, it became clear that Ned Leeds was in fact the villain [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], although this fact was later [[retcon]]ned into Ned's having been a pawn of the ''real'' Hobgoblin. As Leeds became more hostile, Betty drifted into the arms of old friend [[Flash Thompson]]. A jealous Leeds framed Thompson as the Hobgoblin, but when the two battled, the Hobgoblin's mask slipped, and Betty discovered that Ned and the Hobgoblin were one and the same. This revelation, coupled with Ned's murder by the Foreigner, sent Brant over the edge into insanity. 

Betty joined the Students of Love cult, led by the Teacher, before being saved by Flash and Spider-Man. Flash and Betty drifted apart as Betty recovered. She rejoined the staff of the [[Daily Bugle]] as an investigative reporter whose newfound courageous assertiveness and investigative skill impressed her colleages. She finally cleared Ned's name when she revealed that [[Roderick Kingsley]] was the real Hobgoblin. She remains a recurring character in the Spider-Man comics.

===Other media===
The character has appeared in the Spider-Man [[Spider-Man (1960s animation)|1960s animated series]] where she was a prominent [[supporting character]] much in manner of [[Lois Lane]].  As Betty Brant receded into the background in the comics in favor of other love interests, particularly [[Mary Jane Watson]], she appears as a much more minor character such as in the  [[Spider-Man (movie)|feature film]] series as played by [[Elizabeth Banks]].
