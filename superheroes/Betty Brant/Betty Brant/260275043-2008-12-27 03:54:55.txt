'''Betty Brant''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Betty Brant first appears in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #4 ([[1963#September|September 1963]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

Betty Brant Leeds received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #4.

==Fictional character biography==
Betty Brant was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  Her mother had originally been Jameson's "girl Friday" and Betty took the position after her mother's death. Peter Parker (secretly Spider-Man) and she were attracted to each other because Betty wanted a normal, ordinary man, and they were romantically linked. However, her brother was accidentally killed during a fight with Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, and she blamed Spider-Man. Later she forgave Spider-Man when she realized he was trying to protect them.

A year later, Betty broke up with Peter, and she eventually married ''Bugle'' reporter Ned Leeds. However the marriage proved turbulent as Ned was often posted overseas. When he was stationed in [[Paris]] she found the life impossible and left Ned to return to New York. She turned to Peter Parker once more and the two had a brief affair. However Ned followed her home and she was caught between the two men. Peter regretted getting involved with Betty again and allowed the affair to break abruptly, driving her back into the arms of Ned.

Later on in the series, it became clear that [[Ned Leeds]] was in fact the villain [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], although it later turned out that he was a pawn of the ''real'' Hobgoblin. As Leeds became more hostile, Betty drifted into the arms of old friend [[Flash Thompson]]. A jealous Leeds framed Thompson as the Hobgoblin, but when the two battled, the Hobgoblin's mask slipped, and Betty discovered that Ned and the Hobgoblin were one and the same. This revelation, coupled with Ned's murder by the Foreigner, sent Brant over the edge into insanity. 

Betty joined the Students of Love [[cult]], led by the Teacher, before being saved by Flash and Spider-Man. Because her house had been sold during her time with the cult, Betty stayed with Flash for a time. During this, the demonic events of ''[[Inferno (comics)|Inferno]]'' happened, overwhelming much of New York City. Betty and Flash were attacked by demonic duplicates of Spider-Man and Ned Leeds. Betty overcame physical and psychological barriers and succeeded in destroying the monsters. 

Flash and Betty drifted apart as Betty's recovery continued. She rejoined the staff of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' as an investigative reporter whose newfound courageous assertiveness and investigative skill impressed her colleagues. She finally cleared Ned's name when she revealed that [[Roderick Kingsley]] was the real Hobgoblin. She remains a recurring character in the ''Spider-Man'' comics. 

Currently, she has met up with one of Peter's old college friends, [[Debra Whitman]], during a book signing event for Debra's new book "Two-Faced". The book described her relationship with Peter Parker/Spider-Man, which ended in Debra being the victim. However, when it was later revealed that the book was actually altered by the ''Bugle'''s staff to make Spider-Man look like he ruined Debra's life, Betty secretly leaked information to the ''[[Daily Globe]]'', exposing the fraud. Her boss, J. Jonah Jameson, furious with the possible libel suit, now orders Betty to find out who had given the information.

She manages to keep her role even after [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s [[heart attack]] forced his wife to sell the ''Bugle'' to Dexter Bennett, who renamed it ''The DB''. As Dexter is trying to sidestep Betty and make her his "Girl Friday" again, Peter Parker drops hints of a fake family relationship between Betty and the deceased actor [[Marlon Brando]], bolstering her position in Bennett's eye as a gossip reporter.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Betty===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Betty Brant is once again the loyal secretary of J. Jonah Jameson at the ''Daily Bugle''. She's a headstrong woman, trying to get by in life and having as much fun on dates as she can get. She first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #8, where she worked herself up into a rage while trying to build the ''Bugle'''s website.  Peter took over from her and got his job at the ''Bugle'' as a webdesigner.

This version of the character has a considerably different personality, even going as far as making bets about the deaths of missing coworkers. She also lacks the brown bob hairstyle of her Earth 616 counterpart, instead sporting long black hair.

In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #121, Jameson rejects her request to find out more about the disappearance of Nick Fury, alleging that a brief affair with [[Kraven the Hunter#Ultimate Kraven|Kraven the Hunter]] before his arrest proves that she is incapable of any reporting assignment beyond covering college fashion shows.

==In other media ==
=== Television ===
====''Spider-Man'' (1967)====
The character has appeared in the ''Spider-Man'' [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|1960s animated series]], voiced by [[Peg Dixon]], where she was a prominent [[supporting character]] much in the manner of [[Lois Lane]] in the ''[[Superman]]'' franchise. She also appeared in the ''Spider-Man'' [[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|1980s animated series]]. In the 1990s [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|animated incarnation]], she did not appear and [[Glory Grant]] was Jonah's secretary instead.

====''The Spectacular Spider-Man''====
Betty Brant appears in [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''The Spectacular Spider-Man'']], voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. She is twenty years old in this version, and as usual, is the secretary of J. Jonah Jameson. She seemed to share some interest in Peter, and despite her apparent age, he didn't hesitate to ask her out. She turned him down because he was too young for her. He continued to ask her to his Fall Formal, and she almost agreed, however [[Aunt May]], who wanted Peter to go with [[Mary Jane Watson]], talked her into turning him down.

=== Film ===

As Betty Brant receded into the background in the comics in favor of other love interests, particularly [[Mary Jane Watson]], she appears as a much more minor character, such as in the [[Spider-Man (movie)|feature film]] series as played by [[Elizabeth Banks]], and reappears in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. As one of the ''Bugle'''s staff and J. Jonah Jameson's secretary, Betty is usually seen either passing on messages to Jonah or receiving court orders from him. Whilst she never dates Peter, a subtle attraction to him is apparent in the first two films. In ''Spider-Man 3'', Betty seems to have found a way of getting her comeuppance on her boss, by being tasked by his wife to inform him to avoid getting agitated and to remember to take his numerous medications, which she does to comic effect through a loud buzzer/intercom; later, she is hit on by [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Eddie Brock, Junior]], (whom she wants nothing to do with) and a symbiote-influenced Peter Parker (who she is visibly attracted to), only to be interrupted by Jameson, who humorously says "''That's not the position I hired you for!''"
