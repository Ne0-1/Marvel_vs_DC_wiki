==Fictional character biography==
Nimrod is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]-hunting [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] from an [[alternate future]] who was created by the Sentinels who ruled that timeline.  When [[Rachel Summers]] traveled back in time to the present, he followed her. In the process — due to an altered timeline following [[Kulan Gath]]'s occupation of New York — he saved the life of construction worker Jaime Rodriguez, who in gratitude offered him a job and a home with his family, not realizing who or what the Sentinel truly was. 

After gathering information about our timeline, Nimrod eventually changed his prime directive from the extermination of all mutants, having determined that such widespread destruction was not necessary in this era. He instead decided to only exterminate mutants who were regarded as outlaws by the Government, such as the X-Men. In the present, he fought the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].  He hunted Summers and her new teammates, the X-Men, but was defeated by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] when she absorbed the powers of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]; using Nightcrawler's teleportation, she teleported part of Nimrod's body away, with her and Colossus' combined invulnerability protecting her from the resulting damage in a manner that Nightcrawler could not have handled. Sometime after this, Nimrod garnered a reputation with the public of New York City as a heroic [[vigilante]], assuming he was simply a man in powered armor and not a robot. He had also adopted a more human personality since he had established a cover alias as a human being, specifically as a construction worker named Nicholas Hunter. This was due to living with Rodriguez and his family for so long.

Nimrod later faced the combined forces of the X-Men and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Nimrod proved himself a powerful threat, killing Black Rook [[Friedrich Von Roehm]], causing [[Harry Leland]]'s fatal heart attack, nearly killing Nightcrawler and badly injuring Rogue and [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]].

However, when Nimrod came across a piece of the gigantic Sentinel [[Master Mold]] while working on a construction site, his programming was immediately co-opted; Master Mold merged with Nimrod, using its systems to rebuild Nimrod in its own image. The X-Men were hard pressed to defeat the reborn Master Mold at first, but Nimrod came to their aid, claiming he had evolved as well, and no longer viewed them or mutants as a threat. Nimrod asserted enough control over the Master Mold to render it immobile, and even convinced it that it had become a mutant as well; thus, to fulfill its prime directive to exterminate mutants, it must self-destruct. The remains of both robots were pushed through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], a mystical gateway that caused all who passed through it to be reborn with new bodies.  Nimrod and Master Mold were merged into one being: [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]. 

In ''[[X-Force]]'' #35, a modern-day version of Nimrod appeared. This Nimrod was created by an offshoot of [[Project Wideawake]], and was based on the technology derived from the Nimrod from the future. It deactivated itself when [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] convinced it that its existence could cause a [[paradox]] and damage the timestream.

Reverend [[William Stryker]] found a damaged Nimrod as he entered the current Marvel timeline from an alternate one.<ref>''[[New X-Men]]'' #26</ref> Stryker used Nimrod's memories to plan an attack on the X-Men and other mutants, but Nimrod altered its memories to facilitate its own escape, and Stryker was defeated. During the ''[[New X-Men]]'' <ref>Formerly ''New X-Men: Academy X''</ref> story arc "Nimrod", Nimrod searched for whom it thought was its creator, [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]. Nimrod believed Forge could repair its damaged body, but Forge instead transferred Nimrod's programming into a new body which Forge could control. Believing Forge to be in danger, the New X-Men traveled to his apartment to help him. This eventually led to Nimrod gaining control over his body and attacking Forge and the New X-Men. Nimrod was defeated when [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] overloaded Nimrod's temporal unit, blasting Nimrod out of the timestream. Nimrod survived and traveled back in time to March 1985<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #191</ref> with its memory corrupted.

The series ''[[X-Force]]'' reveals that the [[Purifiers]] held on to most of Nimrod's body and have fused it with [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s head to reform Bastion. He then, using the [[Technarch]] [[transmode virus]], revives numerous villains that have destroyed many mutants.

==Powers and abilities==
Nimrod is the most highly advanced form of Sentinel robot. Nimrod can convert his outward appearance to resemble that of an ordinary human being. Nimrod can also reconstruct himself so as to make improvements in his robotic form and internal systems that will make him a more formidable opponent. Even when smashed to pieces, Nimrod can reintegrate the portions of his body to become whole again. Apparently Nimrod's electronic [[consciousness]] can somehow exist independently of his physical body, at least temporarily. 

Nimrod contains highly advanced computer systems as well as scanning devices that make it possible for him to determine whether a human being is a superhuman or not; if they are, he can determine the nature of their superhuman abilities. Like present day Sentinels, Nimrod can draw upon devices and systems within his robotic body in order to cope with or neutralize an opponent's superhuman power once he has determined the nature of that power. 

Nimrod is capable of projecting energy blasts, magnetic energy to levitate material, create [[force field]]s, and can teleport. Apparently, Nimrod has a weakness for elemental attacks such as lightning or extreme cold.
