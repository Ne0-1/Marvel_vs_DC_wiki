'''Nimrod''' was also the name of a [[vampire]] in a ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' story that ran in the [[black and white]] [[Marvel Comics]] ''Dracula Lives!'' series.  Nimrod was the Lord of the Vampires who was defeated and slain by [[Dracula]], making Dracula the new Lord of the Vampires.  A later story in ''[[Bizarre Adventures]]'' revealed that Nimrod had not been the true Lord of the Vampires; Nimrod's master, Varnae (named for ''[[Varney the Vampire]]''), had sent him to die in battle with Dracula as a test of Dracula's strength.
