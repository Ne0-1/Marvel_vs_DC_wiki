The '''Elongated Man''' (Ralph Dibny) is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[universe]].  He is an off-and-on member of [[Justice League|the Justice League]], as well as many of its spin-offs.  His first appearance was ''[[The Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #112 ([[May 12]], [[1960]]).  He was partially created by Julius Scharwtz, who noted he only created the character because he didn't realize DC Comics had acquired [[Plastic Man]] in 1956.

As his name suggests, the Elongated Man can stretch his limbs and body to super-human lengths and sizes.  The Elongated Man got his abilities from drinking the extract of a (fictional) fruit called "gingold".

According to his origin, as a teenager, Ralph adored [[contortionist]]s, or people who displayed feats of agility and suppleness.  He learned that many of these body-benders drank gingold juice. Ralph set to work learning [[chemistry]] and developed a super-concentrated extract of the stuff, which gave him his stretching powers.

Ralph Dibny was one of the earliest [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] DC heroes to reveal his secret identity to the public, and also one of the first to marry his love interest.  He and his wife [[Sue Dibny]] became effectively partners, solving mysteries and participating in [[Justice League]] adventures as equals.  They were also notable in having a stable, happy, and relatively trouble-free marriage — an anomaly in the [[soap opera|soap operatic]] annals of comic books. 

In ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' #1, published in June 2004, tragedy struck these beloved, if second-tier, characters when Sue was murdered in the Dibny home just before she was going to surprise her husband with the news that she was pregnant.  Ralph and Sue also appeared as members of the Justice League offshoot the [[Super Buddies]] in the miniseries ''[[Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'' and its sequel story arc "[[I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League]]". published in ''JLA: Classified'' #4-9. The latter arc was produced before ''Identity Crisis'', but published afterwards. Unfortunately, a running joke in "I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League" involves the possibility of Sue's pregnancy, and seems somewhat morbid after ''Identity Crisis''.

The Elongated Man is also said to be one of the DC Universe's premier [[detective]]s, second only to [[Batman]].

The character has appeared in a few episodes of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' voiced by [[Jeremy Piven]].  This is the first television series in which he has made any appearance.

The character has won and been nominated for several awards over the years, including winning the 1961 Alley Award for Best Supporting Character.
