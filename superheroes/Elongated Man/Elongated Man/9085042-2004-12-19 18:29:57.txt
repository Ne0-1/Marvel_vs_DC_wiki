'''The Elongated Man''' (birth name: Ralph Dibny) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[universe]].  He is an off-and-on member of [[Justice League|the Justice League]], as well many of its spin-offs. His first appearance was ''[[The Flash]]'' (Vol. 2) #112 (May 12, 1960).

As his name suggests, the Elongated Man can stretch his limbs and body to super-human lengths and sizes.  Coming years after such notable "stretching" heroes as [[Quality Comics]]' [[Plastic Man]], the Elongated Man got his abilities from drinking the extract of a (fictional) fruit called "gingold".

According to his origin, as a teenager, Ralph adored [[contortionist]]s, or people who displayed feats of agility and suppleness.  He learned that many of these body-benders drank gingold juice. Ralph set to work learning [[chemistry]] and developed a super-concentrated extract of the stuff, which gave him his stretching powers.

Ralph Dibny was one of the earliest [[Silver age of comic books|silver-age]] DC heroes to reveal his secret identity to the public, and also one of the first to marry his love interest. He and his wife Sue became effectively partners, solving mysteries and participating in [[Justice League]] adventures as equals. 

In ''[[Identity Crisis]]'' #1, published in June 2004, tragedy struck these beloved, if second-tier, characters when Sue was murdered by Jean Loring (the ex-wife of [[The Atom]]) in the Dibny home.   

The Elongated Man is also said to be one of the DC Universe's premier [[detective]]s, second only to [[Batman]].

The character has appeared in a few episodes of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. This is the first television series in which he has made any appearance.
