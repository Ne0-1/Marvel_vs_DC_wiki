The '''Elongated Man''' is a fictional [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He is a reserve member of the [[Justice League]].  His first appearance was ''[[The Flash]]'' vol. 1, #112 (May 12, 1960). He was partially created by [[Julius Schwartz]], who noted he only created the character because he didn't realize DC Comics had acquired [[Plastic Man]] in 1956.

The character has won and been nominated for several awards over the years, including winning the 1961 Alley Award for Best Supporting Character.

==Fictional character biography==
As a teenager, '''Ralph Dibny''' adored [[contortionist]]s, or people who displayed feats of agility and suppleness. He learned that all of the body-benders he spoke with drank a popular soda called "Gingold." Ralph set to work learning [[chemistry]] and developed a super-concentrated extract of the rare Gingo fruit, which gave him his elasticity.

Ralph Dibny was one of the earliest [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] DC heroes to reveal his secret identity to the public, and also one of the first to marry his love interest. He and his wife [[Sue Dibny]] became effectively partners, solving mysteries and participating in [[Justice League]] adventures as equals. They were also notable in having a stable, happy, and relatively trouble-free marriage — an anomaly in the [[soap opera]]tic annals of comic books. Fans of the characters often referred to Ralph and Sue as the "[[Nick and Nora Charles]] of the super-hero set" (a reference to ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' movies).

===''Identity Crisis''===
{{main|Identity Crisis (comics)}}

In ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' #1, published in June 2004, tragedy struck the Dibnys, when Sue was murdered in their home by [[Jean Loring]] just before she was going to surprise her husband with the news that she was pregnant. Ralph and Sue also appeared as members of the Justice League offshoot the [[Super Buddies]] in the miniseries ''[[Formerly Known as the Justice League]]'' and its sequel story arc "[[I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League]]". published in ''JLA: Classified'' #4-9. The latter arc was produced before ''Identity Crisis'' but published afterwards. Unfortunately, a running joke in "I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League" involves the possibility of Sue's pregnancy, and seems somewhat morbid after ''Identity Crisis''.

===''52''===
{{main|52 (comic book)}}

In the 2006 weekly series ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', Ralph Dibny has a gun to his head when he is informed that Sue's gravestone has been vandalized with an inverted version of Superman's 'S' symbol &mdash; the Kryptonian symbol for resurrection. He confronts [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassandra Sandsmark]], and she tells Dibny that she is in a cult that believes that [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] can be resurrected, but that they would like to try it first with Sue. Despite his initial agreement, Dibny and his friends disrupt the ceremony, but the effigy of Sue crawls to Dibny and calls out to him as it burns; Dibny suffers a nervous breakdown as a result.

A voice from within the helm of [[Doctor Fate]] speaks to Dibny and promises to fulfill his desires if he makes certain sacrifices. Dibny journeys with the helm through the [[afterlife|afterlives]] of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic. The [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] promises to resurrect Sue in exchange for Dibny's taking vengeance on [[Jean Loring]], but Dibny is unable to do so. 

At [[Nanda Parbat]], Rama Kushna tells Dibny, "The end is already written." In [[Dr. Fate]]'s tower, Dibny begins the spell to resurrect Sue, puts on the helmet of Fate, and shoots it, revealing [[Felix Faust]], who was posing as Nabu. Faust planned to trade Dibny's soul to [[Neron]] in exchange for his own freedom. Ralph reveals that he was aware of Faust's identity for some time, and that the binding spell surrounding the tower is designed to imprison Faust, not to counter any negative effects of the spell.  Neron appears and kills Dibny, only to realize too late that the binding spell responds only to Dibny's commands: Through his death Ralph has trapped Faust and Neron in the tower, seemingly for eternity, though this victory is short lived as both villains are able to escape seemingly almost immediately.

At the end of Week 52 it is revealed that Dibny's magical, wish-granting gun (a souvenir from "The Anselmo Case", a reference to [http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/lifestory.html ''The Life Story of the Flash'']) worked and that Ralph and Sue are now reunited as ghost detectives, investigating a school where a paranormal phenomenon has just occurred.

==="One Year later"===
{{main|One Year Later}}
In ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' #16, Traci 13 mentioned that she had been taken by Ralph and Sue after her mother died.  This most likely happened some indeterminate time before ''Identity Crisis'' and before Doctor Light's episode with Sue.

===Black Adam===
It is revealed that Ralph's remains are still inside Fate's Tower when Teth-Adam asked Faust if his deal to trick Dibny had worked.

==Powers and abilities==
*The Elongated Man gets his abilities from a combination of drinking a soda named [[List of comic book drugs#Gingold|Gingold]] that contains the extract of a (fictional) fruit called gingo and his natural latent metahuman physiology. The extract interacts with a latent gene that Ralph has, thus activating his super powers. It was revealed in ''Invasion #3'' that it was a metagene reaction to the Gingold elixir that had always provided him with his stretching powers, meaning that he is, in fact, a metahuman and that an ordinary human would not develop such powers through ingesting the extract. Also, most people are extremely allergic to highly concentrated Gingold. The only other hero in the DCU who uses Gingold is Stretch, a member of [[Hero Hotline]] who has been using the compound since the 1940s.
*As his name suggests, the Elongated Man can stretch his limbs and body to super-human lengths and sizes. These stretching powers grant the Elongated Man heightened agility enabling him flexibility and coordination that is beyond the natural limits of the human body. He can contort his body into various positions and sizes impossible for ordinary humans, such as being entirely flat so that he can slip under a door, or using his fingers to pick conventional locks. He can also use it for disguise by changing the shape of his face, although this is painful and difficult for him. Ralph's physiology has greater physical limitations than [[Plastic Man]]; there is a limit to how far he can stretch his finite bodily mass.
*The Elongated Man's powers also greatly augments his durability. He is largely able to withstand corrosives, punctures and concussions without sustaining injury. It has been demonstrated that he is resistant to high velocities that would kill an ordinary person and that he is also more resistant to blasts from energy weapons that would kill ordinary humans. His physiology is more like that of an ordinary human than Plastic Man and as a result he does not share Plastic Man's nigh invulnerability.
*In addition to his stretching abilities, Elongated Man is professionally trained as a [[detective]] and is highly skilled in deductive reasoning. Often considered one of the most brilliant detectives in the DC Universe (on par with [[Batman]] only differing in the actual course of their logic), his name is also a play on ''The Thin Man'' detective serial. He is a talented amateur chemist as well.
*After his sacrifice, he and Sue are ghosts, with all the powers that a ghost possesses such as flight/levitation, intangibility, invisibility and maybe others. 
*Ralph Dibny is a native English speaker, but can also speak French. He can understand [[Interlac]] well enough to translate.

==Other versions==
*Elongated Man has appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book.
*In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Dibny is mentioned as a man in a bar who was reminiscing about the Silver Age and when he heard mention of Batman, his face sagged and his jaw dropped to the floor. In the sequel ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' Dibny is seen hawking a "male enhancement" drink "Gingold" in a TV [[infomercial]]. He is then recruited to aid Batman in his attack against the American government (taken over by [[Lex Luthor]]).
*In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' Ralph is all stretched out and cannot control his stretching.
*An unpowered Ralph Dibny appears as a detective in the Elseworlds series ''Flashpoint''. He is hired by [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] to investigate [[Vandal Savage]]'s company, which is searching for a Martian artifact. J'onzz refers to Dibny as "the Earth manhunter".

==Other media==
The Elongated Man appears in several episodes of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jeremy Piven]]. This is the first television series in which he has made an appearance. Although he appears in numerous episodes as a background character, Elongated Man has only three speaking roles. Elongated Man was never called by the name but called Ralph.

* In "The Greatest Story Never Told", he and [[Booster Gold]] complain about being put on crowd control during a massive battle with [[Mordru]]. Although the episode follows Booster's efforts to stop a [[black hole]] from destroying the city, Elongated Man is called to the front lines and defeats Mordru, albeit offscreen.

* In his second voiced appearance, ("The Ties That Bind") the Elongated Man and [[Wally West#Other Media|The Flash]] express concern about the fact that some other members of the League don't show them enough respect. The Flash goes on to save the day while the Elongated Man sits the mission out.

* His last vocal appearance, ("Clash") his powers are stolen by [[Parasite (comics)|The Parasite]], who uses them to nearly defeat [[Metamorpho]] and [[Batman]] before the timely intervention of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].
