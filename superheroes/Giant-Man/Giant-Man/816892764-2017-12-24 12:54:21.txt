===Hank Pym===
'''[[Hank Pym]]''' was the original character named Giant-Man.

After seemingly dying during the final battle, Pym surprised everyone when he returned as an amalgamation of flesh and Ultron circuitry and encountered the Uncanny Avengers, later joining the team in his new cybernetic form as Ultron. However, the group didn't completely trust him and called the Wasp for help. After the Avengers' fears proved true and Pym transformed into Ultron completely and fought the Unity Division, destroying Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor in the process, the Vision was forced to help the team destroy his 'father'. However, Ultron was later revealed to still be alive.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #13</ref>
