==Publication history==
American Eagle first appears in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #6 (October 1981), by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]]. In a story entitled "An Eagle from America!" Strongbow gains superhuman powers and becomes '''American Eagle'''.

The character subsequently appears in ''[[Contest of Champions]]'' #1, 3 (June & August 1982), ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' #279 (January 1983), and ''[[Rom (comics)|ROM]]'' #65-66 (April 1985-May 1985). He makes several appearances in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', including issue #27 (September 1989; in "Just Another Shade of Hate," American Eagle defeats the [[Peace Monger]]), 128 (1993), 130 (1993), and 147-148 (February 1994). The American Eagle is not seen again for some time until his appearance in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #112-115 (May 2007-August 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Jason Strongbow''', a member of the [[Navajo Nation]] (born in [[Kaibito, Arizona]]), attempted to stop a mining company from excavating a mountain sacred to his tribe. He discovered that the villain [[Klaw]] was in league with the mining company. Klaw needed uranium to augment his sonic powers. Strongbow's brother, Ward, did not agree with him about preserving the mountain. Inside the mine, an argument erupted between the brothers and Klaw which led to violence. During the fight, Klaw used his sonic blaster on the two brothers. Somehow a combination of the sonic energy of the blast and the exposure to the uranium gave both of the Strongbow brothers enhanced physical abilities. Klaw fled with his crew, including Ward, to the [[Savage Land]] in hopes of gaining [[vibranium]] to augment his powers.

Jason emerged from the mine and, taking inspiration from a flying eagle, took up the mantle of American Eagle. He followed Klaw to the Savage Land. There he met [[Ka-Zar]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]]. The four joined forces and defeated Klaw and his minions, but during the battle, Ward was shot and killed by one of the miners.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #6 (October 1981)</ref>

American Eagle returned to become a champion of his tribe, subsequently identified as the Navajo Nation. Since his battle with Klaw in the Savage Land, he was among the heroes of the world gathered to take part in the [[Contest of Champions]],<ref>''Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions'' #3 (August 1982)</ref> he was among the heroes who gathered to honor the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Incredible Hulk (vol. 2)'' #279 (January 1983)</ref> and he was among the heroes who helped [[Rom the Spaceknight]] defeat the [[Dire Wraiths]].<ref>''ROM'' #65 & 66 (April & May 1985)</ref> In his first solo adventure, the American Eagle defeated the [[Peace Monger]] and his Knights of Saint Virgil in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref>''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #27 (September 1989)</ref>

===Post-Civil War===
Jason confirms to his friend Steve that he is strongly against the Super-Human Registration Act created during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] event, and is planning to fight [[Iron Man]] over it.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts]]'' #112 (May 2007)</ref> He also bears a new costume with fewer stereotypically Native American attributes, including a leather jacket and a helmet resembling the head & beak of a bald eagle. It is his intent to prevent the [[Steel Spider]] from direct confrontation with an angry group of men from Jason's Navajo reservation by persuading the Steel Spider to ease up on his zealous vigilante act. By talking to Ollie, he hopes to defuse a time bomb of local violence just waiting to explode.''Ibid.''

The Eagle finds the Steel Spider in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]] as the Thunderbolts unexpectedly arrive. Ollie argues that they will try to kill him and replace him with "Some Good Government Worker". When the Thunderbolts eventually do emerge, Jason decides to ally himself with Steel Spider, shooting the team's leader, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], through the wrist with a crossbow bolt. After a prolonged fight, [[Sepulchre (comics)|Sepulchre]] becomes involved, and the three defeat [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], the [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]. Though the latter two wish to try and defeat them using the old team's methods, leaving Sepulchre and the Eagle, Moonstone orders that [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] cripple the Eagle in the same way he did [[Jack Flag]]. The issue ends with Songbird, Radioactive Man, [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] and Venom squaring up against Steel Spider, Sepulchre and Jason, in what Steel Spider describes as 'almost...a fair fight'.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #114 (July 2007)</ref> 

The Eagle ends up crippling Bullseye before making his escape.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #115 (August 2007)</ref>

A news reporter stated that because American Eagle lives on a [[Indian reservation|Native American Reservation]] he is exempt from the Registration Act, and that the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] would take no action against him because of this.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #116 (October 2007)</ref>

===Dark Reign===
It is revealed that Jason is hiding [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]' mother inside the Navayo County.<ref>''War Machine'' #6</ref> [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] later tries to convince him to subdue War Machine, besides he has no jurisdiction over Strongbow. Jason refuses to act for anyone other than the interests of the Navayo and fights together with War Machine against a "Giant Ultimo Head" Rhodes stumbled upon along the way to find the men behind the "Ultimo Virus" deployed in Acquiria.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

Jason is featured in a stand-alone story in "Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular" #1 (2009).

==Powers and abilities==
American Eagle has superhuman strength sufficient enough to arm wrestle the [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] to a stalemate (however at this time the Thing was not nearly as strong as he is now) or to ably enough force to uproot a large tree. He also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, and sturdiness as a result of radiation-induced mutation. Strongbow's bodily tissues are somewhat harder and more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, he is far from invulnerable. While he can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials, he can withstand impact forces that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it. The American Eagle's sensory organs have also been fortified by the radiation-induced mutation. Like his namesake, the Eagle, he has hyperkeen eyesight, able to see at {{convert|800|ft|m}} what the average human being sees at {{convert|20|ft|m}}. His senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch are approximately three times that of an average human being.

He also carries a crossbow which fires special bolts.

In "Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study," Michael A. Sheyahshe notes that while American Eagle "may have some inherent stereotypic issues, the fact that American Eagle's powers come from a non-ethnically based source (and not, say, the Great Spirit) marks a significant improvement for Indigenous characters." <ref>Sheyahshe, Michael (2008). "Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study". McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. ISBN 978-0-7864-3565-4</ref>

==Other versions==
*There was an American Eagle before Strongbow took the mantle.  Lt. Col. James Fletcher, a renowned battlefield hero of [[World War II]] in recent times became the security chief and trainer for [[Project: Rebirth]].  He was captured by agents of the [[Red Skull]] (Johann Schmidt) and was tortured by the [[Master Interrogator]].  He refused to yield any information and committed suicide to avoid breaking under further torture.  First appeared in ''Adventures of Captain America'' #1 and appeared through to issue #3 which depicted his death.
*There have also been two incarnations of characters named the ''American Eagle'' in the [[Squadron Supreme]], the first being Johnathon James Dore Senior, who was a member of the [[Golden Agency]] and a founding member of the Squadron Supreme.  He is also the father of [[Blue Eagle (comics)|Blue Eagle]].  He first appeared in ''Squadron Supreme'' #1.
*The second incarnation, is the son of the original Squadron's American Eagle.  He took the mantle on during his first appearance in ''Avengers'' (1st series) #85 and his next appearance in ''Web of [[Spider-Man]] Annual'' #5.  He later changed his name to Cap'n Hawk but is more recently known as Blue Eagle.
