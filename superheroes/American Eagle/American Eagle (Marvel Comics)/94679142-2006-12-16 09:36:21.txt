'''American Eagle (Jason Strongbow)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the United States|Native American]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Biography==
'''Jason Strongbow''', a member of the Navajo nation (born in [[Kaibito, Arizona]]), attempted to stop a mining company from excavating a mountain sacred to the Navajo. He discovered that the villain [[Klaw]] was in league with the mining company. Klaw needed uranium to augment his sonic powers. Strongbow's brother, Ward, did not agree with him about preserving the mountain. Inside the mine, an argument erupted between the brothers and Klaw which led to violence. During the fight, Klaw used his sonic blaster on the two brothers. Somehow a combination of the sonic energy of the blast and the exposure to the uranium gave both of the Strongbow brothers enhanced strength, endurance and senses. Klaw fled with his crew, including Ward, to the [[Savage Land]] in hopes of gaining [[vibranium]] to augment his powers.

Jason emerged from the mine and, taking inspiration from a flying eagle, took up the mantle of American Eagle as a champion of the Navajo Nation. He followed Klaw to the Savage Land. There he met [[Ka-Zar]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and [[Wyatt Wingfoot]]. The four joined forces and defeated Klaw and his minions, but during the battle, Ward was shot and killed by one of the miners.

American Eagle returned to become a champion of his people. Since his battle with Klaw in the Savage Land, he was among the heroes of the world gathered to take part in the [[Contest of Champions]], he was among the heroes who gathered to honor the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and he was among the heroes who helped [[Rom the Spaceknight]] defeat the [[Dire Wraiths]]. In his first solo adventure, the American Eagle defeated the [[Peace Monger]] and his Knights of Saint Virgil in Washington, DC.

==Powers==
American Eagle has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, and senses as a result of radiation-induced mutation. He also carries a crossbow which fires special bolts.

==Notes==
*There was an American Eagle before Strongbow took the mantle.  Lt. Col. James Fletcher, a renown battlefield hero of [[World War II]] in recent times became the security chief and trainer for [[Project: Rebirth]].  He was captured by agents of the [[Red Skull]] (Johann Schmidt) and was tortured by the [[Master Interrogator]].  He refused to yield any information and committed suicide to avoid breaking under further torture.  First appeared in ''Adventures of Captain America'' #1 and appeared through to issue #3 which depicted his death.
*There have also been two incarnations in the [[Squadron Supreme]], the first being Johnathon James Dore Senior, who was a member of the [[Golden Agency]] and a founding member of the Squadron Supreme.  He is also the father of [[Blue Eagle (comics)|Blue Eagle]].  He first appeared in ''Squadron Supreme'' #1.
*The second incarnation, is the son of the original Squadron's American Eagle.  He took the mantle on during his first appearance in ''Avengers'' vol. 1 #85 and his next appearance in ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #5.  He later changed his name to Cap'n Hawk but is more recently known as Blue Eagle.
