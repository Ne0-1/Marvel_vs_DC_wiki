{{main|Happy Hogan}}

The first Freak is an alter-ego of [[Happy Hogan]], a friend of [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark).

===Publication history===
Happy first appeared as the '''Freak''' in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #74-76 (February-April 1966), by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gene Colan]]. He appeared as the Freak again in ''Iron Man'' #3-4 (July-August 1968), #26 (June 1970), and #84-85 (March-April 1976).

===Fictional character biography===
When [[Happy Hogan]] had become desperately ill, doctors tried to cure him using a [[cobalt]] ray machine powered by Stark's experimental "Enervator" device. Instead, Happy was mutated into a giant, savage, nearly mindless, superhumanly strong humanoid known as Freak. Though he was restored to his normal self, Hogan would turn into the Freak several times after being exposed to cobalt on several occasions.

The third Freak was a villain that first appeared in [[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]]. A drug addict named "Freak" is chased down by [[Spider-Man]] after he attempted to steal from the poor at the soup kitchen Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] works at.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} He stumbles into a laboratory owned by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] and injects himself with animal gene fluids, thinking they were crystal meth. Freak then began to form a chrysalis around his body, emerging as a skinless monster.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} After being shot at by police, he falls into the sewer and forms another chrysalis.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} Emerging as an animal hybrid, and completely bulletproof, Freak tracks Spider-Man by his scent. After a violent confrontation, Freak gives in to his addictions, and finds a [[clandestine chemistry|meth lab]]. Spidey follows him, and during the ensuing fight, the building is set ablaze. Freak is caught under the flaming debris, but survives and creates a new chrysalis, which has made him fireproof and even stronger.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} Freak emerges as an armadillo-like creature, and again tries to kill Spider-Man.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} When Connors arrives with the [[quicklime]] necessary to incapacitate Freak, Spider-Man tricks him into thinking Connors has drugs.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} Freak tears open the bags, and is covered in the quicklime.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} He again forms a chrysalis, with Spider-Man pouring quicklime over it, to permanently incapacitate him. The chrysalis is taken by a hazmat crew, which is later revealed to be an [[Oscorp]] research group.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

Freak is next seen cut open and hooked up to machines in an Oscorp lab where scientists are using his unique abilities to cure various diseases.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #572</ref> Norman Osborn injects him with a sample of the [[Anti-Venom]] antibodies to create "super-venom," a virus capable of killing millions with a single drop.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} He then uses the super-venom to re-power [[Mac Gargan]] who was "cured" of his symbiote by Anti-Venom. Norman also mentions that Freak is incapable of becoming high now because his body adapted to his drug addiction by removing the pleasure center of his brain.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} In the confrontation between Spider-Man and Osborn, Osborn activates the building's self-destruction, with Freak still inside. A search afterwards by Oscorp found "no signs of life", which made the team reason that Freak was killed, with Osborn immediately retorting "Idiot. Think about it for a second."<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, Freak is informed by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where he exchange for securing some specific items for him. Freak went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He ended up colliding with [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] (Jimmy Natale) before [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] showed up.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref> Spider-Man goes on a rampage against the villains after the infant was kidnapped from him by the Chameleon, and Spider-Man defeats the Freak.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref>
