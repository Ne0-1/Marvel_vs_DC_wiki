'''Freak''' is the name of two fictional characters in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Happy Hogan==
[[Iron Man]]'s friend [[Happy Hogan]] had become desperately ill, prompting doctors to attempt a new surgical technique including cobalt radiation. Doctors used a cobalt ray machine powered by Stark's experimental "Enervator" devicem, which saved Happy's life. The process transformed Happy into the '''Freak''', a giant, savage, nearly mindless, superhumanly strong humanoid.  The Freak broke loose and went on a rampage, escaping before Iron Man could arrive to stop him.<ref>Tales of Suspense #74</ref>

Iron Man led the Freak back to his laboratory but ran out of power and collapsed.  The Freak encountered [[Pepper Potts]], who fainted at the sight of him, and carried her away. The police fired on him, causing him to drop Pepper. Iron Man saved Pepper, and led the Freak to his lab again. Iron Man exposed him to the Enervator, which restored him to normal. Happy was amnesiac for a while about these events.

While later helping Iron Man rebuild his armor, Happy was again exposed to cobalt rays and was again transformed into the Freak.  The Freak smashed Iron Man through a wall, and took Pepper with him.  Iron Man was able to again return Happy to normal.

The [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] later kidnapped Happy and Pepper, hoping to add the Freak to his collection.  This drew Iron Man's attention, who intervened and rescued his friends.

Later, while Happy was injures while wearing the Iron Man armor, Stark used the Enervator to save him, thinking that he had corrected the problems with his device.  Regardless, the device again transformed Happy into the Freak, who went on another rampage.  He exposed himself to cobalt materials, causing him to glow with energy that would eventually reach critical mass and explode.  The two battled again, until Stark was able to use the Enervator to again revert Happy to normal.

Happy has not become the Freak since then, and has since passed away.

==Eddie March==

Eddie March was another friend of Tony Stark who was wearing the Iron Man armor.  Eddie was badly injured in a fight with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].  Stark decided to use the Enervator on Eddie in a desperate attempt to save him.  Though Stark took precautions to prevent the device from transforming Eddie into a monstrous creature, he failed and Eddie became a new Freak.  Iron Man tried to subdue him, while simultaneously protecting him from the police.  He was able to knock the Freak out with a few nerve punches, and when he was unconscious he reverted to human form and Dr. Donald Blake was able to operate on Eddie to save his life.

Eddie has not transformed into the Freak since this incident.
