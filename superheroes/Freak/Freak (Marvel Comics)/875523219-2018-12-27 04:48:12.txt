{{main|Happy Hogan (comics)}}
The first Freak is an alter-ego of [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], a friend of [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark).

When Happy Hogan becomes desperately ill, doctors try to cure him using a [[cobalt]] ray machine powered by Stark's experimental device known as the Enervator. Instead of being cured, however, Happy mutates into a large, savage, nearly mindless and superhumanly strong humanoid known as the Freak.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #74 (February 1966)</ref> Though he is restored to his normal self,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #76 (April 1966)</ref> Happy turns into the Freak again several times after being exposed to cobalt radiation on several occasions, mostly due to repeated use of the Enervator on him.<ref name="Freak Happy" />

The second Freak was Eddie March, another friend of Tony Stark.<ref>''Iron Man'' #21 (January 1970)</ref>

While wearing the [[Iron Man's armor|Iron Man armor]], Eddie March is badly injured in a fight with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Stark decides to use the Enervator on Eddie in a desperate attempt to save him. Though Stark takes precautions to prevent the device from transforming Eddie into a monstrous creature, Eddie nonetheless becomes a new version of the Freak. Stark, as Iron Man, tries to subdue him while simultaneously protecting him from the police. He is able to knock out the Freak with a few nerve punches. Once unconscious, the Freak reverts to human form and Thor's alter ego, Dr. Donald Blake, is able to operate on March to save his life.<ref>''Iron Man'' #67 (April 1974)</ref>

Eddie has not transformed into the Freak again since this incident.

The third Freak is a villain that first appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]]''. A drug addict nicknamed Freak is chased down by [[Spider-Man]] after attempting to steal from the poor at the [[soup kitchen]] where Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] works.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #546</ref> Freak stumbles into a laboratory owned by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] and injects himself with animal gene fluids, thinking that they are [[crystal meth]]. A chrysalis forms around Freak's body, and he later emerges as a skinless monster.<ref name=AS552>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #552</ref> After being shot at by police, he falls into the sewer and forms another chrysalis. Emerging as an animal hybrid and completely bulletproof, Freak tracks Spider-Man by his scent.<ref name=AS553>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #553</ref> After a violent confrontation, Freak gives in to his addictions and finds a [[clandestine chemistry|meth lab]]. Spider-Man follows him. During the ensuing fight, the building is set ablaze. Freak is caught under the flaming debris, but survives and creates a new chrysalis, which has made him fireproof and even stronger.<ref name=AS554>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #554</ref> Freak emerges as an [[armadillo]]-like creature and again tries to kill Spider-Man. When Connors arrives with the [[quicklime]] necessary to incapacitate Freak, Spider-Man tricks him into thinking Connors has drugs. Freak tears open the bags and is covered in the quicklime. He again forms a chrysalis, with Spider-Man pouring quicklime over it, to permanently incapacitate him. The chrysalis is taken by a [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] crew — which is later revealed to be an [[Oscorp]] research group.<ref name=AS558>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #558</ref>

Freak is next seen cut open and hooked up to machines in an Oscorp lab where scientists are using his unique abilities to cure various diseases.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #572</ref> [[Norman Osborn]] injects him with a sample of the anti-venom antibodies to create "super-venom", a virus capable of killing millions with a single drop. He then uses the super-venom to re-power [[Mac Gargan]] who was "cured" of his symbiote by Anti-Venom. Osborn also mentions that Freak is incapable of becoming intoxicated because his body has adapted to his drug addiction by removing the pleasure center of his brain.<ref name=AS552 /> In the confrontation between Spider-Man and Osborn, Osborn activates the building's self-destruction with Freak still inside. A search afterwards by Oscorp reveals "no signs of life", which made the team reason that Freak was killed, with Osborn immediately retorting "Idiot. Think about it for a second."<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Freak is invited by supervillain [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his team in exchange for securing some specific items for him. Freak goes after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He collides with [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (Jimmy Natale) before [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] arrives.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref> Spider-Man goes on a rampage against the villains after the infant is kidnapped from him by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], and Spider-Man defeats Freak.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Happy Hogan version of the Freak can absorb large doses of cobalt radiation without harming himself and also discharge cobalt blasts from his hands.

The third Freak can adapt to any situation by forming a chrysalis around himself after being wounded or killed, then returning to life in a different appearance. He also has [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]-like bulletproof durability and strength and acidic saliva, can shoot toxic spores from his body at will, and can adapt to certain harsh environments.
