'''''Saint Sinner''''' is a [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] as a part of the [[Razorline]] [[imprint]]. All of the Razorline titles were creations of horror/fantasy writer and filmmaker [[Clive Barker]] and he described the series as "Saint Sinner is just a wild one, the series which hopefully will press the limits of what comics can do."<ref>[http://www.clivebarker.info/ints93b.html Interviews 1993 (Part Two)] at CliveBarker.info (official site)</ref>

Aside from the title, it is unrelated to the Barker-produced [[telefilm]] ''[[Saint Sinner (film)|Saint Sinner]]''.

==Publication history==
''Saint Sinner'' was published for seven issues (Oct. 1993 - April 1994) before being discontinued with the rest of the Razorline titles. The writing for all seven issues was done by [[Elaine Lee]], with the art split between [[Max Douglas]] (first three issues), [[Richard Pace (comics)|Richard Pace]] (fourth-issue [[script breakdown|breakdowns]], finished by Douglas; fifth-issue pencils, inked by Douglas) and [[Larry Brown (comics)|Larry Brown]] (final two issues).

The final release of the Razorline imprint was ''Ectokid Unleashed'', a 48-page one-shot that also contained a ''Saint Sinner'' [[prose]] short story by [[Elaine Lee]].

==Fictional character biography==
''Saint Sinner'' is centered on Philip Fetter, a man [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by both a [[demon]] and an [[angel]]. With the ability to evolve or regress anyone from superhuman to primal beast, Fetter travels the world changing lives.
