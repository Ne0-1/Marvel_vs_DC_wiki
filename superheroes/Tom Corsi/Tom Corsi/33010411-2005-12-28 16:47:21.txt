==Character biography==
Tom Corsi was a member of the [[New York City Police Department]] in Westchester County. The [[Demon Bear]] carried out an attack on [[Danielle Moonstar|Dani Moonstar]]. After her attack, the [[New Mutants]] brought Dani to the Mid-County Medical Center. At the hospital, Tom and [[Sharon Friedlander]], an ER nurse, were kidnapped and possessed by the Demon Bear. The Demon Bear attempted to transform Corsi and Friedlander into his demonic slaves. After the New Mutants defeated the bear, Tom and Sharon were returned to their natural human form, with a couple of minor physical changes. The two of them now physically resemble Native Americans, along with being enhanced to the level of perfect human specimens.

Afterwards, Tom spent some time at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]. Eventually, Tom found himself involved in a battle with the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] on [[Muir Island]]. Tom was also one of the Muir Islanders being manpuilated by the [[Shadow King]], at the time.

Being part of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s Mutant Underground, he was asked to work at Our Mother of the Sacred Heart, a school for the handicapped. The school eventually came under attack by a group of [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] looking for a potential mutant. In the process, Tom killed one of the [[Kleinstocks (comics)|Kleinstock Brothers]].

In his most recent appearances, some time after, Tom was a gym teacher at the Massachusetts Academy, before the school was closed down.
