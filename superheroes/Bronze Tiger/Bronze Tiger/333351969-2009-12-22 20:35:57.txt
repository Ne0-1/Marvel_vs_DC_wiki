==Fictional character biography==
Ben Turner comes from an upper middle class black neighborhood in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. When he was only 10 years old, he saw a burglar attacking his parents, and he proceeded to murder the man with a kitchen knife. In an effort to control the rage inside him, Turner turns to martial arts (and eventually, crime). After some time, Turner decides to travel to the far East in order to finally come to terms with his demons<ref name="SS38">As all revealed in ''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #38 (1990), written by [[John Ostrander]] (plot) and [[Robert Greenberger]] (script).</ref>. There, he meets the [[O-Sensei (comics)|O-Sensei]], and studies under him, together with later recruit [[Richard Dragon]]. The meeting between Turner and Dragon serves as the start of the series ''Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter''. Some time after they are approached by [[Barney Ling]], from the organization known as [[G.O.O.D.]] (Global Organization of Organized Defense), and their (reluctant) working for Ling served as the basis for the ''Kung Fu Fighter'' series.

A flashback in ''DC Comics Presents'' #39 (1981) shows Richard Dragon discovering that Turner has been brainwashed into becoming the Bronze Tiger by [[Professor Ojo]], then used by Barney Ling (who turns out to be a traitor). Dragon and Turner prove to be equals in the fight, which only ends when Ling is accidentally knocked out a window.

Later, in ''Suicide Squad'' #38, Turner's further career is shown, wherein he and Dragon are hired by [[King Faraday]] to work for the CBI (Central Bureau of Intelligence). If this was meant as a retcon or an addition to their history is not made clear. Assigned to take down the [[League of Assassins]], Dragon and Turner are discovered by the League, who kill Turner's fiance√©, Myoshi, and proceeded to brainwash Turner. Turner was rid of his demons by channeling them into the identity of the Bronze Tiger, a masked assassin working for the League.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name="SS38" />

During this time, he also trains the assassin [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]]'s daughter, [[Cassandra Cain|Cassandra]], together with other members of the League. As the Bronze Tiger, Turner developed a fearsome reputation in the world, his identity remaining a secret to everyone but the League.

As the Bronze Tiger, Ben was feared around the world, and the Sensei was smart enough to ensure that Ben hardly ever took off the mask, sending him on a new mission as soon as he finished another. For a time, his identity was secret and he became one of the most wanted criminals, the Bronze Tiger being a professional assassin, killing on three continents.

The Bronze Tiger is eventually sent to murder [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] (the superheroine Batwoman), a friend of [[Batman]]. While fighting Batman (and defeating him), another assassin kills Kane <ref>In ''Detective Comics'' #485 (1979), written by Denny O'Neil</ref>. After [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] (known as post-Crisis) it was determined that Kathy Kane had never become Batwoman, and had merely been a friend of Batman's.  Another character named Kathy Kane became Batwoman in 2006, and seems to be a completely different character.  There are currently no indications that the death of the "original" Kathy will be addressed.  Since the Kathy killed by the League never became Batwoman post-Crisis, it currently seems that their shared name should just be considered a coincidence.

Learning of Bronze Tiger's true identity, King Faraday set up a rescue squad of [[Rick Flag]] and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]]. They retrieved the Tiger, and he was deprogrammed by [[Amanda Waller]], who would later run the [[Suicide Squad]].

===''Suicide Squad''===

Waller later recruits Turner for the Suicide Squad, setting him up to become the team's leader, but he ends up the team's second-in-command under Rick Flag.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  On the team's first mission, the Tiger faces [[Ravan (comics)|Ravan]], who he brutally cripples, but refuses to kill. Turner develops a relationship with [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], while [[Flo Crawley]], a part of the Squad's support crew, nurses a crush for him. Meeting Ravan again later, Turner convinces him to join the Squad, and the two become an effective fighting duo.

As the ''Suicide Squad'' series was mostly populated by villains, the Tiger was one of the Squad's 'good' members, meant to balance out the cast of characters. He often enforces Waller's rules, such as forcing various Squad members to wear devices designed to force good behavior. 

The almost corrupting nature of the Squad eventually leads to Rick Flag's departure from the Squad and seeming death in a nuclear explosion. Turner becomes the leader of the team, in which he excels, often disobeying direct orders to save the lives of his men (even if they were "expendable"). The Squad member Duchess, in reality the Apokilptian soldier [[Lashina]], betrays the team and takes many, including Flo, home to [[Apokolips]]. Flo does not survive the kidnapping. 

In ''Suicide Squad'' #38, Turner is confronted for his actions by his superiors, and in the ensuing meeting, Turner's mind snaps. He flees, traveling back to the East (leaving Vixen in the process), where he spends some time as a [[janissary]]. Shortly afterwards, the Suicide Squad is disbanded and Amanda Waller is sent to jail.

Eventually, after a year, Amanda Waller reforms the Squad and again recruits Turner. In the missing year, Turner had become a deeply troubled man, who distances himself from Vixen and was constantly egging on Ravan to confront him. In one mission shortly after the team had reformed, Vixen is hurt, and this unlocks Turner's feelings for her once more. He mostly returns to his old state of mind. Vixen laters leaves the team, and she and Turner part on good terms.

In the team's last mission, the Squad struggles to free a small island nation from the tyranny of its seemingly immortal ruler. The team must pass through a forest known for causing hallucinations. While the others experience their own mind-trips, Bronze Tiger faces himself. Defeating himself, and there by excorsizing his demons, Turner once again becomes a complete person. The tyrant is later defeated by Waller.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #65 (1992), written by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Kim Yale]]</ref>.

===After ''Suicide Squad''===
[[Image:BronzeTigerAsTeacher.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Bronze Tiger as a League Member training Cassandra Cain, and as Master of the Tiger Dojo.]]

Shortly after leaving the Squad, Turner is part of the [[Knightfall|Knightquest]]: The Search story arc in the Batman books, which covered Bruce Wayne's search for [[Jack Drake]] (father of [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the most recent [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]) and Shondra Kinsolving, who had been kidnapped. He teams up with [[Green Arrow]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]], a member of the short lived [[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]. Gypsy becomes romantically involved with Tiger. He later becomes her mentor in the martial arts. 

The Bronze Tiger re-appears in the (2004) ''[[Richard Dragon]]'' title alongside Dragon, written by [[Chuck Dixon]]. Dixon introduced several [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]s into the series, including the notion that Turner was actually Dragon's teacher, and not the O-Sensei. These retcons were not referred to anywhere else, and the series has mostly been disregarded.

In a story arc of the ''[[Batgirl]]'' title in 2005, Cassandra Cain begins a search for her birth mother, who she believes is [[Lady Shiva]]. She tracks down Turner in Detroit, where he has opened the "Tiger Dojo". Both are able to come to terms with Turner's involvement in Cassandra's training, and he expresses his pride at her becoming a hero.
Bronze tiger met with Batman shortly afterwards.He had to stop a group of villans and avenge his master.

===52===
In the [[World War III (DC comics)|World War III]] event, Bronze Tiger is shown to have retired, but is coaxed back into action by Amanda Waller.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
In ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' (vol. 2) Bronze Tiger rescues [[Rick Flag]] from a secret [[Qurac]]i prison, where Flag had been imprisoned for four years.  Notably he is seen wearing a variant on the costume he wore while with the League of Assassins, complete with a tiger head mask (according to writer Nunzio DeFilippis he wears the mask to prove it no longer has any power over him<ref>"Not a mistake. We decided he'd be in the mask for a reason.  Ben wears it to show that, to paraphrase from The Man In The Iron Mask, he wears the mask - it doesn't wear him (at least, not anymore)."
 - ''Nunzio DeFilippis'' [http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showpost.php?p=3868482&postcount=13 Comic Book Resources Forums, October 24 2006]</ref>).  Afterwards, [[Amanda Waller]] appears at the Tiger Dojo, revealing to Ben that she leaked the information about Flag's whereabouts.  She then enlists their aid in tracking down a supposedly rogue Suicide Squad team, a team which in reality was being run by Flag and Turner at Waller's behest. 

In [[Countdown (comics)|Countdown]] #39, Bronze Tiger is among the Suicide Squad members trying to bring in [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] and The [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]].

===Gotham Underground===
In a recent appearance in the mini-series [[Gotham Underground]], Bronze Tiger is among the members of the Suicide Squad arresting [[Two-Face]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Hugo Strange]], and [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]].  While frisking Scarecrow, he is gassed by the escaping villain, revealing an intense fear of insects.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Batwomandeath.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bronze Tiger defeating Batman, leading to Kathy Kane's death.]]
The Bronze Tiger possesses no [[metahuman]] powers, but is a superb martial artist. Many consider him one of the top 10 martial artists in the DC Universe, if not in the top 5. He has bested such great martial artists as [[Batman]] before. Turner defeated Batman in ''Detective Comics'' #485 (1979), a side result of which was the death of Kathy Kane. He would face Batman again shortly after. Even though Batman had taken every possible precaution for the rematch, neither fighter was able to gain an advantage, and the fight only ended when one of the League members shot Batman with a poisoned dart.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Bronze Tiger appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Return of the Fearsome Fangs" voiced by [[Gary Sturgis]]. Formerly Master Wong Fei's best student and protector of a small village, he holds much pride as a Martial Artist. He helps Batman battle the [[Terrible Trio]] in a reluctant partnership after they killed their sensei of whom both he, the Caped Crusader, and the trio trained under. He takes in the power of the Wudang Totem during a fight with the empowered threesome, turning into a tiger. He is reverted to normal after the fight, deciding to reopen Wong Fei's school, and having a rematch with Batman.
