==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
Ben Turner comes from an upper middle class black neighborhood in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. When he was only 10 years old, he saw a burglar attacking his parents, and he proceeded to kill the man with a kitchen knife. In an effort to control the rage inside him, Turner turns to martial arts (and eventually, crime). After some time, Turner decides to travel to the far East in order to finally come to terms with his demons.<ref name="SS38">As all revealed in ''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #38 (1990), written by [[John Ostrander]] (plot) and [[RGreenberger]] (script).</ref> There, he meets the [[O-Sensei (comics)|O-Sensei]], and studies under him, together with later recruit [[Richard Dragon]]. The meeting between Turner and Dragon serves as the start of the series ''Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter''. Some time after they are approached by Barney Ling, from the organization known as [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#G.O.O.D.|G.O.O.D.]] (Global Organization of Organized Defense), and their (reluctant) working for Ling served as the basis for the ''Kung Fu Fighter'' series.

A flashback in ''DC Comics Presents'' #39 (1981) shows Richard Dragon discovering that Turner has been brainwashed into becoming the Bronze Tiger by [[Professor Ojo]], then used by Barney Ling (who turns out to be a traitor). Dragon and Turner prove to be equals in the fight, which only ends when Ling is accidentally knocked out a window.

===League of Assassins===
Later, in ''Suicide Squad'' #38, Turner's further career is shown, wherein he and Dragon are hired by [[King Faraday]] to work for the [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#C.B.I.|C.B.I.]] (Central Bureau of Intelligence). Assigned to take down the [[League of Assassins]], Dragon and Turner are discovered by the League, who kill Turner's fiance√©, Myoshi, and proceeded to brainwash Turner. Turner was rid of his demons by channeling them into the identity of the Bronze Tiger, a masked assassin working for the League.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name="SS38" />

During this time, he also trains the assassin [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]]'s daughter, [[Cassandra Cain|Cassandra]], together with other members of the League. As the Bronze Tiger, Turner developed a fearsome reputation in the world, his identity remaining a secret to everyone but the League.

As the Bronze Tiger, Ben was feared around the world, and the Sensei was smart enough to ensure that Ben hardly ever took off the mask, sending him on a new mission as soon as he finished another. For a time, his identity was secret and he became one of the most wanted criminals, the Bronze Tiger being a professional assassin, killing on three continents.

Learning of Bronze Tiger's true identity, King Faraday set up a rescue squad of [[Rick Flag]] and [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]]. They retrieved the Tiger, and he was deprogrammed by [[Amanda Waller]], who would later run the [[Suicide Squad]].

===''Suicide Squad''===
[[Image:SuicideSquad65.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Cover to ''Suicide Squad'' #65, illustrated by [[Geof Isherwood]], [[Robert Campanella]] and Tom McCraw.]]

Waller later recruits Turner for the Suicide Squad, setting him up to become the team's leader, but he ends up the team's second-in-command under Rick Flag.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  On the team's first mission the Tiger faces [[Ravan (comics)|Ravan]], whom he cripples but refuses to kill. Turner develops a relationship with [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], while a member of the Squad's support crew, Flo Crawley, nurses a crush on him. Meeting Ravan again later, Turner convinces him to join the Squad, and the two become an effective fighting duo.

The ''Suicide Squad'' was mostly populated by villains, but the Tiger is one of the Squad's 'good' members, meant to balance out the cast of characters. He often enforces Waller's rules, such as forcing various Squad members to wear devices designed to force good behavior. A Bronze Tiger solo story appeared as a [[DC Comics Bonus Book|Bonus Book]] in ''Suicide Squad'' #21 (December 1988).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/45449/ ''Suicide Squad'' #21] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

The nigh-corrupting nature of the Squad eventually leads to Rick Flag's departure and seeming death in a nuclear explosion. Turner becomes the leader of the team, a role in which he excels, often disobeying direct orders to save the lives of his team (even if they were "expendable"). The Squad member Duchess, in reality the Apokoliptian soldier [[Lashina]], betrays the team and takes many, including Flo, to [[Apokolips]]. Flo does not survive the kidnapping.

Turner is eventually confronted by his superiors about his actions, and in the ensuing meeting Turner's mind snaps.<ref name=":0">''Suicide Squad'' vol. 1 #38 (February 1990)</ref> He flees, traveling back to the East (leaving Vixen in the process), where he spends some time as a [[janissary]].

Eventually Amanda Waller reforms the Squad and again recruits Turner. In the interim Turner has become a deeply troubled man, one who distances himself from Vixen and was constantly egging on Ravan to confront him. In a mission shortly after the team had reformed Vixen is hurt, which unlocks Turner's feelings for her once more. He mostly returns to his old state of mind. Vixen laters leaves the team, and she and Turner part on good terms.

In the team's last mission, the Squad struggles to free a small island nation from the tyranny of its seemingly immortal ruler. The team must pass through a forest known for causing hallucinations. While the others experience their own mind-trips, Bronze Tiger faces himself. Defeating himself, and thereby exorcising his demons, Turner once again becomes a complete person. The tyrant is later defeated by Waller.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 1) #65 (1992), written by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Kim Yale]]</ref>

Shortly after leaving the Squad, Turner is part of Bruce Wayne's search for Jack Drake (father of Tim Drake) and Shondra Kinsolving, who had been kidnapped.<ref>Knightquest: The Search story arc in the Batman books</ref> He teams up with [[Green Arrow]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]], a member of the short lived [[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]. Gypsy becomes romantically involved with Tiger. He later becomes her mentor in the martial arts.

In a story arc of the ''Batgirl'' title in 2005 Cassandra Cain begins a search for her birth mother, who she believes is Lady Shiva. She tracks down Turner in Detroit where he has opened the "Tiger Dojo". Both are able to come to terms with Turner's involvement in Cassandra's training and he expresses his pride at her becoming a hero. Bronze Tiger meets with Batman shortly afterwards. He has to stop a group of villains and avenge his master.

===World War III and beyond===
In the ''[[World War III (DC comics)|World War III]]'' event, Bronze Tiger is shown to have retired, but is coaxed back into action by Amanda Waller.

In ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' (vol. 2) Bronze Tiger rescues [[Rick Flag]] from a secret [[Qurac]]i prison, where Flag had been imprisoned for four years. Notably he is seen wearing a variant on the costume he wore while with the League of Assassins, complete with a tiger head mask (according to writer Nunzio DeFilippis he wears the mask to prove it no longer has any power over him<ref>"Not a mistake. We decided he'd be in the mask for a reason. Ben wears it to show that, to paraphrase from The Man In The Iron Mask, he wears the mask - it doesn't wear him (at least, not anymore)."
 - ''Nunzio DeFilippis'' [http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showpost.php?p=3868482&postcount=13 Comic Book Resources Forums, October 24 2006]</ref>). Afterwards, [[Amanda Waller]] appears at the Tiger Dojo, revealing to Ben that she leaked the information about Flag's whereabouts. She then enlists their aid in tracking down a supposedly rogue Suicide Squad team, a team which in reality was being run by Flag and Turner at Waller's behest.

In ''[[Countdown (comics)|Countdown]]'' #39, Bronze Tiger is among the Suicide Squad members trying to bring in [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] and The [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]].

In a recent appearance in the mini-series ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Bronze Tiger is among the members of the Suicide Squad arresting [[Two-Face]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Hugo Strange]], and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]. While frisking Scarecrow, he is gassed by the escaping villain, revealing a previously undiscovered fear of insects.

Bronze Tiger appears in a ''[[Blackest Night]]''-related one-shot entitled ''Blackest Night: Suicide Squad'' #67 (part of a series of one-shots operating as extra issues to long-since canceled ongoing series). He works with fellow [[Suicide Squad]] members [[Count Vertigo]] and [[Rick Flag]] to bring down a Mexican drug lord. When the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] attempt to break into Belle Reve prison, Bronze Tiger squares off with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] to see who is the superior feline-themed martial artist.

===The New 52===
{{Update|date=August 2017}}
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Bronze Tiger appears as a member of the League of Assassins.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #21</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Bronze Tiger possesses no [[metahuman]] powers, but is a master martial artist with lightning-fast reflexes. He has mastered several fighting styles such as [[Boxing]], [[Hapkido]], [[Jeet Kune Do]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Judo]], [[Karate]], [[Kung-Fu]], [[ Muay Thai]], [[Savate]], [[Silat]], [[Vale Tudo]], and [[Taekwondo]].<ref name=":0" /> He has bested notable martial artists such as [[Batman]]<ref>''Detective Comics'' #485 (1979)</ref> and fought Richard Dragon to a standstill. He is on the fighting level of [[Lady Shiva]]. He is also an adept acrobat and has extraordinary stamina. Bronze Tiger's fighting prowess has given him the reputation of being a lethal weapon.

In present day, he is recruited by [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X program]] and sent for a mission to find Steel Maxum and retrieve a mystical "Get Out of Hell Free" card by any means. He is also shown to be the most moralized of the Squad members as he has the vow to never take away any innocent life. He also has an ill relationship with [[Deadshot]], as he has a high grudge with assassins like the one who murdered his fianc√©e. After a fight with Deadshot for walking away for a failed attempt to see his own daughter Zoe, Bronze Tiger is entrusted by Waller to be the team leader. Right after [[Professor Zoom]]'s henchmen kidnap and recruit [[Killer Frost]], Bronze Tiger assists the Squad on tracking the teammate but only to fall into Zoom's trap of Killer Frost's removed nano-bomb and Waller's anger to set off the bomb. Bronze Tiger is caught by the explosion and heavily injured, resulting in Deadshot resuming the role as team leader.

He later appears again in the final showdown stopping [[Captain Boomerang]] from getting away with the card and distracting Zoom enough for Deadshot to catch up even though Zoom manages to reopen his wounds using a small dagger. With his last strength, Bronze Tiger manages to cut off Zoom's fingers using the same small dagger to strip the card off his hands, allowing Deadshot to kill Zoom. Dying, Bronze Tiger makes peace with Deadshot, who passes him the card which sends Bronze Tiger directly to heaven.
