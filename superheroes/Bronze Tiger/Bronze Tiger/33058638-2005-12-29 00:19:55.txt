'''Bronze Tiger''' ('''Ben Turner''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]].  He is a [[martial arts|martial artist]] who first appeared in ''[[Richard Dragon]] Kung Fu Fighter'' as a [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] agent of the [[League of Assassins]].  

==Detailed History==
===Childhood===
Ben Turner came from an upper middle class black neighborhood in Central City. Already at the age of 10, Ben Turner killed a man. A white burglar was assaulting his parents, when young Ben Turner went berserk, grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing the man till he died. Ben Turner would later admit that he didn't feel sorry that he had killed the man, but that it had ended too soon. 

At 13 Ben Turner turned to martial arts in hopes of controlling those rages. Nonetheless, the conflict still gave him a kick that did not serve to solve his problems. Young Ben Turner even felt joy as he continued to learn more and more methods of hurting people, eventually surpassing even his teachers. This continued violence lead him into a lot of trouble as he performed crimes to satisfy his needs.

===Controlling the anger===
Seeing that this need for violence would ultimately send him either to jail or the electric chair, Ben Turner saw that he had to truly control his anger, and as soon as he was old enough, he traveled to the far East. There he studied with several different martial arts masters, all of which ignored his quest to control the joy and rage, but rather tried to exploit it. 

Eventually, he came upon the O-Sensei, who took him in and showed him how to succesfully control his anger. While there he would meet Richard Dragon, the two becoming close friends, and they were recruited by the CBI (Central Bureau of Intelligence) agent [[King Faraday]]. The two were not only good friends but a great team as well.

===Becoming the Bronze Tiger===
Eventually, they were assigned to take down the League of Assassins, but they were discovered, and the League killed the Tiger's fianceé, a woman named Miyoshi. Ben himself was also captured by the League, and came under the control of their Sensei, who seduced Turner to study with him. Unlike the O-Sensei, this Sensei promised Turner that they could completely divert the anger, so that he would never have to deal with it again.

To accomplish that, Ben created the tiger mask he would later wear, and channeled his anger within it, and giving it a name: The Bronze Tiger. Ben felt he was now finally able to live his life free of the rage, but the Sensei had other plans. The anger of course, had never really left, simply relocated, and when Ben Turner put on the mask at the behest of his Sensei he became the Bronze Tiger, the joy of dealing death personified.

As the Bronze Tiger, Ben was feared around the world, and the Sensei was smart enough to ensure that Ben hardly ever took off the mask, sending him on a new mission as soon as he finished another. For a time, his identity was secret and he became one of the most wanted criminals, the Bronze Tiger being a professional assassin, killing on three continents. 

===Running up against a Wall===
A captured agent was able to discover the Bronze Tiger's identity, but the CBI was still unable to capture the Tiger, untill a conflict between the League and [[Ra's al Ghul|Rā's al Ghūl's]] people led the two groups to [[Gotham City]], and as such the Bronze Tiger. Sent to kill [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] (originally Batwoman in the Pre-Crisis contuinity), the Bronze Tiger would end up fighting, and defeating, Batman while another assassin killed Kathy Kane.

It was then that King Faraday recruited [[Rick Flagg]] and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]] to retrieve the Bronze Tiger from the League. Flagg was able to single-handidly fend off the Bronze Tiger, while Nightshade and Faraday took out any unwanted observers. Eventually, Faraday got his shot, and was able to pump the Tiger full of [[tranquilizer]] darts.

The Sensei's work had been succesfull though, and even without the mask, Ben Turner was stil his lackey, untill that rage and anger ran up to one woman that could not be scared, [[Amanda Waller]]. She completely broke the Tiger's spirit and slowly but surely, she also put him back together again, and he was able to face his past and once again return to being Ben Turner. He burned the tiger mask, leaving behind the anger and the past, swearing to never kill again.

===The Suicide Squad===
Amanda Waller would proceed to use the Bronze Tiger for her new team, the [[Suicide Squad]]. Although, she wanted him as the leader, the higher-ups insisted that Col. Rick Flagg take up command of the squad, with Ben as second-in-command. Already on their first mission, it was shown that the Tiger had not yet fully shaken his anger, when he faced Jihad-member [[Ravan (comics)|Ravan]] in combat.

The two fought, but the Bronze Tiger had the upper hand, yet refused to lay the killing blow upon Ravan, instead opting to break his back. Although the Bronze Tiger stated that he had sworn that he would not kill, he later admitted that he wanted to see Ravan suffer, and that is why he had not killed him. Ravan swore to kill Ben.

One of Belle Reve's (Suicide Squad HQ) ground crew, Flo Crawley fell in love with Ben, but he spurned her advances, especially when the voloptuos [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] joined the team. Ben and Vixen would pursue a relationship together, and were a happy couple for quite a while.

During the team's second encounter with the Jihad, the Bronze Tiger was once again bested Ravan in combat, but instead of leaving him, he was able to convince Ravan to join the Suicide Squad. The two would form an uneasy alliance, but were still a great team together.

The Bronze Tiger was one of the Squad's 'good' members, and was ussually opposed to the actions of the criminals he worked with, something that almost came to a head when the team was forced to apprehend rogue member Rick Flagg, who was going to kill a US Senator. Ben feared that the morally less capable members of the team would end up killing Flagg, but to [[Deadshot]]'s credit, Rick Flagg was left alive (although forced to flee from the police and leave the Squad), although Deadshot opted to kill the Senator himself. This ultimately led to the public reveal of the Suicide Squad, and Amanda Waller being put on trial.

Without Rick Flagg, Ben Turner became the leader of the Suicide Squad. He proved himself capable on the ensuing missions (although ussually disobeying the orders of his superiors), but when half of his team had been kidnapped by [[Lashina|Duchess]] (secretly Lashina), Ben Turner once again disobeyed his orders and assembled a small squad composed not of the criminals in Belle Reve, but of Arkham Asylum. Finding their way to [[Apokolips]] with the help of the [[Forever People]], Ben was able to rescue his squad, although not without casualties, amongst them Flo Crawley.

Although, technically speaking, the Bronze Tiger had not disobeyed his orders, he was summoned by [[Sarge Steel]] (one of his superiors), who wanted to see how much of the old Bronze Tiger still resided within Ben. Before this small gathering, Ben recounted his history, and Sarge Steel ended up showing him a replica of his tiger mask, asking him to put it on, to show he had truly tempered the beast.

Ben snapped in the following meeting, and ran away, leaving Vixen behind and traveling to the East (where he spent some time as a [[jannisary]]). Shortly afterwards, the Suicide Squad was disbanded and Amanda Waller was jailed.

===The Squad reformed===
Eventually, after a year, Amanda Waller was able to reform the Squad, as a freelance group no less, and amongst her recruits was the Bronze Tiger. Together with Vixen, she confronted him in a derelict bar in [[Harar]], capital city of [[Ogaden]], where Ben Turner had completely reverted to his beastial persona. Confronted again with the unbeatable spirit of Waller, Ben was convinced to join the Suicide Squad.

During the following missions, Ben Turner was shown as a deeply troubled man, distancing himself from Vixen, and trying to instigate a conflict between him and Ravan. Ravan, seeing what the Tiger was trying to pull, declined to face Ben in mortal combat, even going so far as to laugh in Turner's face. On that same mission, Vixen was hurt in a battle with a meta-human operative of the [[Mossad]], which seemed to re-awaken the Ben Turner of old, and he saved her life.

A short time later, Vixen left the team, and she parted on relatively good terms with Ben, seeing that both had changed, and they could no longer be in a relationship. She was no longer angry with him and thanked him for saving her life, as she walked out of his.

The Bronze Tiger would go on several more missions with the Suicide Squad, and in their last, in an enchanted forest, he came face to face with the personification of himself as the Bronze Tiger.

''"You somebody I know?"<br>''
''"I am your anger. I am your pride. I will be your death."<br>''
''"Perhaps. But you will no longer be my master."<br>''
'''From Suicide Squad #65, by John Ostrander'''

Defeating the Bronze Tiger, Ben pulled off the mask to see himself when he was young. Putting on the illusionary mask, Ben Turner finally came to terms with who he was, and with the rage that was within him, becoming a complete person once again. After this final mission, the Suicide Squad was disbanded.
