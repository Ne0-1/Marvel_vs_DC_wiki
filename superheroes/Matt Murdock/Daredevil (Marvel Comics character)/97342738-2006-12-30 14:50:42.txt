'''Daredevil''' ('''Matthew Murdock''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]]<ref name="r1">Comics historian and former [[Jack Kirby]] assistant [[Mark Evanier]], investigating claims of Kirby's involvement in the creation of both [[Iron Man]] and Daredevil, interviewed Kirby and Everett on the subject, years before their deaths, and concluded [http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq4.htm] that, "in both cases, Jack had already drawn the covers of those issues and done some amount of design work. He ... seems to have participated in the design of Daredevil's first costume. ... Everett did tell me that Jack had come up with the idea of Daredevil's billy club. ... Jack, in effect, drew the first page of that first Daredevil story. 

In the rush to get that seriously late book to press, there wasn't time to complete Page One, so Stan had [production manager] [[Sol Brodsky]] slap together a paste-up that employed Kirby's cover drawing. ... Everett volunteered to me that Jack had "helped him" though he wouldn't — or more likely, couldn't — elaborate on that. He just plain didn't remember it well, and in later years apparently gave others who asked a wide range of answers". 

Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] later noted that when Everett turned in his first-issue pencils extremely late, Brodsky and [[Spider-Man]] artist [[Steve Ditko]] inked "a lot of backgrounds and secondary figures on the fly and cobbled the cover and the splash page together from Kirby's original concept drawing" [http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays4.htm].</ref> in ''Daredevil'' Vol. 1, #1 (April 1964), he is notable as being among the few superheroes with a [[disability]]. [[blindness|Blinded]] during his youth, his other four senses developed to compensate, and he obtained a [[sonar]]-like ability to perceive objects.<!--The 1940s Golden Age Daredevil was originally mute, and Dr. Mid-Nite was blind. Marvel's DD is one of the few, but not one of the first. Marvel's own [[Professor X]] even precedes him. -->

Although ''Daredevil'' had been home to the work of many comic-book legends — [[Jack Kirby]], [[Wally Wood]], [[John Romita, Sr.]] and [[Gene Colan]], among others — it was not until [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] entrance on the title in the late 1970s that ''Daredevil'' was regarded as either popular or influential. The introduction of drastic change, following Miller's example, became the title's hallmark; as writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] described, "This is the book where the audience is built into expecting something unique. Every run on ''Daredevil'' has been a unique statement from that person and a lot of chances were taken." <ref>''Comic Book Resources'': CBR News - The Comic Wire (Jan. 25, 2006): [http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6488 "Truth or Daredevil: Bendis Talks the End of His ''Daredevil'' Run"], by Dave Richards</ref>

[[Irish-American]] Matthew Murdock was raised by [[single father]] and fading [[Boxing|boxer]] "Battling Jack" Murdock in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. Jack instilled in Matt the importance of education and non-violence with the aim of seeing Matt grow to be a better man than himself.  Though Jack's intentions were noble, Matt was left unprepared to handle the bullying he received at school, and was branded with the derisive nickname, "Daredevil". Matt vented his frustration and anger by training in secret.

In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt was blinded by a [[radioactive]] substance that fell from the vehicle. Though the act of heroism robbed him of his sight, the radioactive exposure heightened his remaining senses beyond normal human thresholds, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him.   A mysterious man named [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] became his mentor, teaching him to control his new abilities while honing his natural aptitude in [[acrobatics]] and [[martial arts]]. Matt continued to honor his father's wishes by excelling in his studies, and ultimately enrolled in the [[Columbia Law School|Columbia School of Law]].

[[Image:DDY3cover lg.jpg|thumb|right||Murdock and Nelson beginning their business. Art by [[Tim Sale]].]] 
At university Matt fell in love with [[Elektra Natchios]], the daughter of a Greek diplomat.  When Elektra and her father were kidnapped by terrorists, Matt wore a mask for the first time and fought to save them.  In the mayhem that followed, Elektra's father was shot and killed. Overcome with grief, Elektra broke Murdock's heart by leaving Columbia behind and returning to the study of martial arts.

Back in Hell's Kitchen, Jack struggled and became an enforcer for the small-time crook and boxing manager, the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]. In exchange for his services, the Fixer rigged a series of matches and provided "Battling Jack" a late-life boxing renaissance, resulting in the once near-destitute fighter becoming a title contender. On the night of the title fight -- and with his son in the crowd -- Jack ignored the Fixer's demands to take a dive and won by knockout. For his disobedience, the Fixer had him murdered.

Matt was devastated both by the loss of his father and the judicial system's failure to convict the men responsible. Mindful of the childhood promise Matt made to his father not to lead a violent life, Matt created a new identity with which to provide justice himself. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes, renamed with the moniker of his childhood derision, and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronted the killers and avenged his father.

Matt continued his studies and graduated at the top of his class. Together with his best friend and college roommate [[Franklin Nelson|Franklin "Foggy" Nelson]], Matt opened the law practice of Nelson & Murdock, and soon thereafter hired [[Karen Page]] on as secretary.

Daredevil moved to [[San Francisco]] in the early 1970s to live with his girlfriend, the Black Widow. However, the move did not last long: The Widow ended their relationship, fearing that playing sidekick to Daredevil was causing her to lose her identity as a superheroine, and Murdock returned to Hell's Kitchen. The two remain intimate friends and occasional lovers.

In ''Born Again'', Karen Page returns as a heroin-addicted star of [[adult films]], who sells Daredevil's secret identity for a hit. The Kingpin, who uses this information to try to destroy Murdock piece by piece: blowing up his house, ruining his reputation as a lawyer, menacing his personal life and nearly driving him insane. Miller ends the story on a positive note, with Murdock reuniting with Karen Page and the mother he thought dead, and resuming a less complicated life in Hell's Kitchen.

In the story arc "Fall from Grace", Daredevil's secret identity becomes public knowledge. Forced to fake his own death and change his uniform to an armored "razor costume", Murdock undergoes one of his numerous breakdowns. The change does not take, and Daredevil soon returns to his traditional red costume, while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a [[deus ex machina]] [[doppelgänger]]).

The team's story developments included a coup against the Kingpin by ambitious mobster [[Sammy Silke]], and the subsequent, violent revenge taken by Vanessa Fisk, the Kingpin’s wife. Silke, in exchange for protection, gives Daredevil's identity to the [[FBI]], which makes it public in the ''Daily Globe''. Murdock responds by vigorous denials and a [[libel]] [[lawsuit]] against the newspaper. While the world ponders whether the respected attorney has made a mockery of the justice system with many past trials involving Daredevil, his client Hector Ayala, the original [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], is shot and killed by police after Murdock loses a [[manslaughter]] case in which Ayala was innocent.

Murdock meets and romances the blind [[Milla Donovan]], and battles efforts by the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]] to take Fisk's place as Kingpin by marketing the drug MGH (Mutant Growth Hormone). Daredevil discovers that the Kingpin, thought dead, has recovered from the coup's attempt on his life, and after a violent confrontation that sends his nemesis to the hospital declares ''himself'' the Kingpin of Hell's Kitchen.
Writer-artist David Mack took over ''Daredevil'' once more for five issues, bringing back his character Maya Lopez. Afterward, Bendis and Maleev jumped a year ahead to find an increasingly  violent and antisocial Daredevil. He and Donovan have married, and Murdock has won his case against the ''Daily Globe'', resulting in a multimillion dollar settlement he reinvests into the local community. His reporter friend [[Ben Urich]], who knows Daredevil's identity, tries to convince Murdock that he has suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] brought on by unresolved feelings over the death of Karen Page. Donovan, in response, annuls the marriage.

In their first arc, "The Devil in Cell-Block D" (Daredevil #82-87), the imprisoned Murdock is helpless to stop the apparent murder of Foggy Nelson at Ryker's. Meanwhile, a mysterious new Daredevil appears in Hell's Kitchen. Murdock escapes with the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] during a prison riot and discovers the ersatz Daredevil is his friend and [[Hero for Hire]] Danny Rand, the martial-arts superhero [[Iron Fist]]. As Rand had planned, his actions make Daredevil's real identity again a subject of media debate. In addition, Ryker's Warden Cole defends Murdock on live television, blaming the FBI for Murdock's incarceration. Unaware that Nelson is in fact alive and in the [[Witness Protection Program]], Daredevil begins the arc "The Devil Takes A Ride" (Daredevil #89 - ) in [[Monte Carlo]] seeking information on the lawyer connected to Nelson's attempted murder. There Daredevil encounters a new version of the [[Matador (comics)|Matador]].

==Publication history==
===Volume 1: 1964 - 1998===
Daredevil's original costume as created by Everett — with input from  Kirby — was a combination of black, yellow and red, and went through minor revisions in issues #2 through #4 by [[EC Comics]] artist [[Joe Orlando]]. Fellow acclaimed EC veteran Wally Wood penciled #5-8, introducing the modern red costume in issue #7. [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] great [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]] ([[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]]) penciled two issues over Wood layouts, and they then swapped for #11, which Wood inked over Powell's pencils.

Issue #12 began a brief run by Jack Kirby (layouts) and [[John Romita, Sr.]] It was Romita's return to superhero penciling after a decade of working exclusively as a [[romantic fiction|romance]]-comic artist for DC. Romita had felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker.<ref>Romita, from ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #6 (Fall 1999) [http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06romita.html]: "I had inked an ''[[The Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' job for Stan, and I told him I just wanted to ink. I felt like I was burned out as a penciler after eight years of romance work. I didn't want to pencil any more; in fact, I couldn't work at home any more — I couldn't discipline myself to do it. He said, 'Okay,' but the first chance he had he shows me this Daredevil story somebody had started and he didn't like it, and he wanted somebody else to do it." Elaborating in ''Alter Ego'' #9 (July 2001) [http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/09romita.html], he added, "Stan showed me [[Dick Ayers]]' splash page for a ''Daredevil''. He asked me, "What would you do with this page?" I showed him on a tracing paper what I would do, and then he asked me to do a drawing of Daredevil the way I would do it. I did a big drawing of Daredevil ... just a big, tracing-paper drawing of Daredevil swinging. And Stan loved it."</ref>

[[Image:Daredevil47.jpg|180px|thumb|left|''Daredevil'' Vol. 1, #47 (Dec. 1968). Cover art by [[Gene Colan]] (pencils) and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]] (inks).]]

When Romita left to take over ''Amazing Spider-Man'', Lee gave ''Daredevil'' to the character's first signature artist, [[Gene Colan]], who began with issue #20 (Sept. 1966). Colan pencilled all but three issues through #100 (June 1973), plus the 1967 annual, followed by ten issues sprinkled from 1974-79. (He would return again, an established legend, for an eight-issue run in 1997). Among the notable plot developments during this period were Matt Murdock's panicky creation of a "twin brother", the "sighted" and devil-may-care Mike Murdock, in #25 (Feb. 1967), whom Karen Page and Foggy Nelson are led to believe is Daredevil; "Mike's" death in #41 (June 1968); and Matt revealing his Daredevil identity to Karen Page in #57 (Oct. 1969).

Much like in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' — and in what was already an established hallmark of Marvel Comics storytelling — interpersonal drama was as central to the series as action and adventure. A triangle of unrequited love develops between Foggy Nelson, Karen Page and Murdock, with Nelson unable to win over Page and Matt unable to admit that Page loves anyone other than Daredevil. When the revelation of Murdock's dual identity proves too much for Page, she leaves the firm and the comic.

In the 1970s the title featured a double billing, co-starring Daredevil's girlfriend the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]. During this time, the series was written by such writers as [[Gerry Conway]], [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Chris Claremont]].  Artists included [[Bob Brown]] and [[Don Heck]]. Among the highlights are the origins of [[Moondragon]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]] and [[Nekra]], as the wrap-up of the first [[Shanna the She-Devil]] storyline.  Readers are also introduced to the [[Dark Messiah]], Candace Nelson, the [[Man-Thing|Sallis Papers]] and [[Death-Stalker]].

[[Image:Dd181.png|thumbnail|right|170px|Elektra dies — temporarily — in ''Daredevil'' Vol. 1, #181 (April 1982). Cover art by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Klaus Janson]].]]

The modern definition of ''Daredevil'' began in 1979 with [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] entrance on the title.  Miller's first contributions were as an artist, where he imbued a new dynamism and a drastically different visual style.  The series' tone became that of [[film noir|noir]] with [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] itself playing a more prominent role.

With issue #168, Miller additionally became the series' writer, and the comic underwent a drastic metamorphosis. The most significant change was the introduction of [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] as Daredevil's new archnemesis. Until that point, Daredevil's enemies were primarily, though not exclusively, costumed villains. The Kingpin was a departure in that although he possessed extraordinary size, strength and fighting ability, his villainy came from his ruthless brilliance in running a criminal empire and not super-powers. The title still retained costumed antagonists — namely [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] — but found its central theme to be one more grounded in reality — [[organized crime]].

Miller also introduced [[ninjas]] into the Daredevil canon, bringing a greater focus on the [[martial arts]] aspect of Daredevil's fighting skills, and introducing the characters [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. This was a drastic change to a character once considered a swashbuckler. The focus of a ninja's control of the inner self served as a counterbalance to the emerging themes of anger and torment.

Comics-artist legend [[Wally Wood]], following kidney failure and the loss of vision in one eye, returned to the character he helped define, inking Miller's cover of ''Daredevil'' Vol. 1, #164 (May 1980). It was one of Wood's final assignments before his death in 1981.

Miller's noir take on the character continued after he left. However, successor [[Denny O'Neil]] did not find the commercial success of his predecessor. In late-1985, Miller returned to the series, co-writing #226 with O'Neil, then writing the "[[Daredevil: Born Again]]" storyline in #227-233 (Feb.-Aug. 1986), with artist [[David Mazzuchelli]].

A round-robin of creators contributed in the year that followed ''Born Again'': writers [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Danny Fingeroth]], [[Steve Englehart]] (under the [[pseudonym]] "John Harkness") and [[Ann Nocenti]], and pencilers [[Steve Ditko]], [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], Louis Williams, [[Sal Buscema]], [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Keith Pollard]],and Chuck Patton. [[Longshot]] co-creator Nocenti, who'd written #236, became the regular writer for a four-and-a-quarter year run of all but two issues from #238-291 (Jan. 1987 - April 1991). [[John Romita, Jr.]] joined as penciler from #250-282 (Jan. 1988 - Jul. 1990), and was generally inked by [[Al Williamson]]. The team specifically addressed societal issues, with Murdock, now running a non-profit urban legal center, confronting [[sexism]], [[racism]] and [[nuclear proliferation]] while fighting supervillains. Nocenti introduced the popular antagonist [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] in issue #254.

Under writers [[Karl Kesel]] and then later [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] the book gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the wisecracking, more lighthearted hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and [[Foggy Nelson|Foggy]] (who now knows of Matt's identity as Daredevil) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother Rosalind Sharpe.

===Volume 2: 1998 - Present===
[[Image:Ddsmith.png|thumbnail|175px|left|The death of Karen Page. Promotional art for ''Daredevil Visionaries: Kevin Smith'' by [[Joe Quesada]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]].]]
In 1998, ''Daredevil'''s numbering was rebooted, with the title "cancelled" and revived a month later as part of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint. [[Joe Quesada]] drew the new series, written by filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]].  Its first eight-issue story arc, "[[Daredevil: Guardian Devil|Guardian Devil]]" depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the [[Messiah]] or the [[Anti-Christ]]. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has [[AIDS]] (later revealed to be a hoax), and her subsequent murder by Bullseye.

After "Guardian Devil", Smith was succeeded by writer-artist [[David Mack]], who contributed the seven-issue "Parts of a Hole"[Daredevil #9 - 15]. This arc introduces Maya Lopez, also known as [[Echo (comics)|Echo]], a [[deaf]] martial artist.  Mack brought indie-comic colleague [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to Marvel for the following arc, "Wake Up" [Daredevil #16 - 19].  This story follows reporter [[Ben Urich]] as he investigates the after-effects of a fight between Daredevil and a retconned character known as Leapfrog. Events in the arc intersect with Mack's earlier run "Parts Of A Hole".

Following Mack and Bendis were ''[[Back to the Future]]'' screenwriter [[Bob Gale]] and artists [[Phil Winslade]] and David Ross for the story "Playing to the Camera" ( Mack continued to contribute covers ).

[[Image:Daredevil50.jpg|right|200px|Daredevil  as Hell's Kitchen's new Kingpin. ''Daredevil'' Vol. 2, #50 (October 2003). Cover art by [[Alex Maleev]].|thumb]]
Issue #26 (Dec. 2001) brought back [[Brian Michael Bendis]], working this time with artist [[Alex Maleev]], for a four-year-run that became one of the series' most acclaimed. Maleev's harsh and grainy look is in contrast to Quesada's more cartoony lines, and distinctively reads like a marriage of Frank Miller's [[film noir|noir]] style and the [[Pulp magazine|pulp-magazine]] art of the 1920s and '30s. 

Among the developments in their nearly 50 issue run were the introduction of Milla Donavon, the outing of Murdock's secret identity to the press, the reemergence of the Kingpin and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI.

Writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Michael Lark]] became the new creative team with ''Daredevil'' #82 (Feb. 2006), no longer under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.

==Powers, abilities and weapons==
While Daredevil is blind, the combination of his remaining four [[senses]] ( hearing, smell, touch, and taste) perform at superhuman levels.  Daredevil also possesses a "radar sense" &mdash; alternately explained to be either a direct result of his contact with radioactive waste as a boy, or simply the effect of the combination of his four enhanced senses &mdash; that allows him to "see" the world around him by means of a sort of echo-location.

Due to his superhuman sense of touch, his dexterity and reflexes are at an extremely high, nearly superhuman level. His fighting style combines American [[boxing]] with Japanese [[ninjutsu]], [[judo]] and [[aikijujutsu]]. 

Additionally, Daredevil carries a [[billy club]] that can be disguised as a blind man's cane.  A cable can be extended from its top half to aid in swinging through New York City.  Daredevil also frequently uses it as a projectile.

==Characters==
===Love interests===
[[Image:Ddelektra.png|175px|thumb|Detail from cover of ''Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller Vol. 2'' TPB. Art by Miller.]]

Within [[Marvel Comics]], few characters feature a love life as convoluted and tortured as Daredevil's. His girlfriends fall roughly into two groups: ordinary women who suffer great pain at his side; and superpowered, highly-dangerous love interests. Either way, most end up killed, maimed or traumatized. Arguably, Daredevil is a character plagued with [[Women-in-Refrigerator]] syndrome.

* [[Karen Page]] — Once his law firm's secretary-receptionist, she devolved into a [[heroin]]-[[addiction|addicted]] [[pornographic actress]]. She later turns her life around and gets a respectable job but not long after she is killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].

==Appearances in other media==
===Film===
[[Image:Daredevil_poster.JPG|thumb|190px|''Daredevil'' movie poster.]]
Daredevil's earliest appearance in a theatrical movie was a cameo in Kevin Smith's ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001), in which the starring characters run through a movie lot where an actor in a Daredevil costume has an action scene in the background. The DVD includes a longer Daredevil scene. Kevin Smith had previously written for ''Daredevil''.

In [[February 2003|February]] [[2003 in film|2003]], [[20th Century Fox]] released [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'']], a feature film starring [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], and directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]]. While opening strongly and eventually surpassing $100 million in ticket sales, poor word-of-mouth and negative reviews curtailed its momentum.

A [[director's cut]] [[DVD]] was released November 2004 with nearly 30 minutes of additional footage, including a subplot involving a murder trial that led to the capture of Kingpin Wilson Fisk. Several appearing scenes in the theatrical release were missing from or altered in the director's cut. Missing scenes include Murdock and Elektra's love scene, and scenes set inside a church [[confessional]]. A scene featuring Bullseye that was placed after the credits in the theatrical version was integrated into the movie in the director's cut.
