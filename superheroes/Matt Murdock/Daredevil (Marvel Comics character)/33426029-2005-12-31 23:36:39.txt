'''Daredevil''' (Matt Murdock) is an [[Irish-American]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Bill Everett]], he debuted in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April [[1964]]).

As a child, Matthew Murdock was blinded when an act of heroism put him in the path of radioactive materials.  Though no longer able to see, the accident heightened his remaining senses to [[superhuman]] levels and imbued in him a sixth, [[sonar]]-like sense.  A high-profile attorney by day, Murdock uses his abilities as well as his training in [[acrobatics]] and [[martial arts]] to protect the people of [[Hell's Kitchen]] as the pulp hero Daredevil.

Daredevil was not an overly popular or influential Marvel hero until the late [[1970s]], when writer/illustrator [[Frank Miller]] made him a much darker character.  Miller's Daredevil was a fierce guardian of inner city [[New York City|New York]] who danced along the edge of sanity as he attempted to uproot deep corruption and urban decay.  The character has enjoyed a modern renaissance since the launch of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint, with notable creators [[Kevin Smith]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Alex Maleev]].


==Origin==
[[Image:DD066_COV.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|Daredevil's first costume.  Art by Alex Maleev, 2004.]]
Matt Murdock grew up in the [[Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[New York City]], the son of Battling Jack Murdock, a fading [[Boxing|boxer]], single father and occasional hired enforcer.  Desperate to have Matt lead a better life than his own, Jack insisted that his son stay out of trouble and receive an education.  Though endlessly taunted with the sarcastic nickname "Daredevil" by school bullies, Matt endured his hardships and studied hard, working out in secret as a way to vent his anger.

An act of heroism, however, would change his life completely.  An old and blind man crossing the street was in the path of an oncoming and out of control truck hauling radioactive waste.  Matt selflessly saved the man but, in doing so, was struck in the face with radioactive material.

A difficult recovery ensued, but the blinded youth soon learned to cope with his disability, and in so doing learned the boons of his radioactive exposure.  Namely, his remaining senses had been raised to superhuman sharpness: he could hear any sound regardless of volume or pitch, smell more capably than a bloodhound, taste and identify individual ingredients of prepared foods, and touch so acutely that he could read regular newsprint as if it were [[braille]].  The accident also granted him a radar sense, independent of his other senses, which would allow him to detect the positions and general shape of objects around him (similar to [[echolocation]]).  His mind emits a pulse-like frequency that goes out into the environment and bounces off objects and return to him to give him a "picture" of his surroundings.  Frank Miller later added to the origin by revealing that  Matt soon met a [[sensei]] and [[pool shark]] named [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] who took it upon himself to train the boy to control his senses as well as in acrobatics and fighting skills. 

Matt did good on his promise to his father, and excelled in his law school studies.  However his father struggled back home as a washed up boxer and, to that end, approached the one fight promoter willing to book him, a small time crook nicknamed the Fixer.  'Battling Jack' found a late-life renaissance as the Fixer engineered a series of rigged matches, resulting in the once near-destitute boxer becoming a title contender.  On the night of the biggest fight of his life, the Fixer looked to cash in on his investment and instructed Jack to take a dive but Jack, seeing Matt in the crowd, could not disappoint his son.  Battling Jack Murdock gave the fight of his life to win by knockout and subsequently gave his life when the Fixer ordered his hit.

Devastated, both by the loss of his father and the judicial system's failure to convict the Fixer, Matt Murdock took it upon himself to provide justice.  Mindful of the promise he made to his father not to lead a violent life, Matt created a new identity for himself, fashioning a yellow and black costume from his father's boxing robes and adopting the catch-phrase of his childhood derision, "Daredevil", as his nickname.  Daredevil confronted the Fixer's gang, making short work of the lot through the use of his hidden abilities and secret training.  The Fixer himself managed to escape to a subway tunnel wherein his own panic and fear of Daredevil produced in him a fatal heart attack.

Together with secretary [[Karen Page]] and best pal and partner [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin "Foggy" Nelson]], Murdock became the lawyer he promised his dad he would become.  But realizing that the justice system was imperfect, and that he could better serve society and his own personal torment with a dual career in costumed crime fighting, Matt Murdock permanently adopted the mantle of Daredevil.

==1964-1998 Series== 
[[image:dd19.png|thumb|left|140px|Cover to ''Daredevil'' #19, by John Romita, Sr.]]
This character was an undistinguished second stringer character that came off as a [[Spider-Man]] knock-off with a similar flair for acrobatics and swinging among the towers of [[New York City]].  The title did benefit from noteworthy artists such as comics legend [[Wally Wood]] whose short run was not only among the best drawn but also responsible for changing Daredevil's costume to the distinctive red uniform (during a classic bout with the [[Sub-Mariner]] in ''Daredevil'' #7).  In addition, the series enjoyed a long run by artist [[Gene Colan]] whose talent helped keep the title vital through much of the 1960s and '70s.  Yet sales were rarely strong, and at one point in the early '70s, with the standard format/price in flux, Marvel even announced Daredevil and [[Iron Man]] were to be folded into a single title â€” reversing its decision before ever combining the books.

===Wallace Wood===
Often underplayed in his role in the scope of Daredevil, Wally Wood was rather famous for a time in changing Daredevil's then Black and Yellow costume to the now known pure red.  Wood, who beforehand, was primarily known as a MAD magazine artist, quickly gained notability for his creation of the red costume, and his Daredevil stories were the precursor to the darker tone that Frank Miller followed up with.

===Frank Miller===
[[Image:Dd181.png|thumbnail|right|140px|Elektra dies in ''Daredevil'' #181. Art by Frank Miller, 1982.]]
This changed in 1979 with new artist [[Frank Miller]].  His art brought a new dynamism to the comic; his writing even more so.  The series' tone became that of [[film noir|noir]], where evil seems ever-present, [[Political corruption|corruption]] is rife throughout the seats of power.  The comic's hero became a tortured man constantly trying to reconcile his principles with the inner rage that proved to be the real reason he chose to become Daredevil.

In #168, Miller's first issue as a writer, an old flame was revealed from Daredevil's past, [[Elektra Natchios]]. A college girlfriend at [[Columbia University]] and a daughter of a [[Greece|Greek]] [[diplomat]], she had an [[Amorality|amorally]] wild violent streak that led her to become a deadly [[ninja]] [[assassin]], eventually even entering the employ of the Kingpin.

Many of the regular [[antagonist]]s were dropped as Miller set up the principals who have become definitive with the modern Daredevil.  The [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], originally a Spider-Man villain, became the truly king-like master of New York's [[organized crime]].  He would share a complex relationship with the hero who would become his greatest enemy.  [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], formerly just a [[hit man]] with unerring aim and the ability to use any object that he can shoot or throw as a [[weapon]], became a cold-blooded pathological murderer who is Daredevil's physical nemesis on the street level.  Daredevil also gained a mentor, the mysterious [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], a [[sensei]] who trained the young Matt to control his senses and taught him the acrobatic martial arts that would make him so formidable. 

Miller's initial run lasted until issue #191 (Feb 1983). Taken together, Frank Miller created a sensation that established a new take on superheroes with a dark tone that would influence the whole genre.  ''Daredevil'' became a popular title and Frank Miller's influence would be felt ever since.

===After the change=== 
After Frank Miller left the ''Daredevil'' title, other artists joined the character, taking their cues from Miller's dark noir style.  Immediately following Miller was [[Batman]] writer [[Denny O'Neil]] who had made similar revolutionary changes to Batman in the seventies, he was never as popular as Miller who soon returned for his 1986 ''[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]'' storyline (#227-233), which gathered particular critical acclaim and popularity.

In this story, Daredevil's identity is revealed by his long time love interest, Karen Page.  The information quickly makes it to his most dangerous nemesis, the Kingpin, who uses his influence in the city to tear apart Matt's life and reputation, nearly driving him mad in the processes.  This story had an unusual element in it for Miller as it ended on a positive note with Matt reuniting with the mother he had thought dead and picking up his life, still damaged, but not unsalvagable.

Immediately following this storyline, [[Longshot]] co-creator [[Ann Nocenti]] was put in charge of the title and remained on there for several years, continuing the more serious and gritty tone of the book.  Although her run was, again, criticized for not being up to the high standard left by Miller, it did introduce the popular reoccuring character of [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].

===Man Without Fear===
Later, Miller again returned to the title with a retelling of Daredevil's origin in ''[[Man Without Fear]]''.  Originally written as a screenplay for an always optioned but never produced Daredevil movie, Miller adapted it into a comic.

The most obvious element remaining of the screenplay element being the fact that until the very last page in the book Matt Murdock never wears a costume. This is very relevant for the time.  While the following decades would demonstrate varying degrees of success in depicting comic book costumes on the big screen, in the [[1980s]] superheroes depicted on screen almost always resembled children's Halloween costumes, making grown men look more ridiculous than impressive.

''Man Without Fear'' mainly focused on Matt Murdock's relationship with his father (Jack), his mentor (Stick), and his first love (Elektra).  The art for the series was drawn by [[John Romita Jr.]] who well depicted a gritty realism while at the same time offering a dramatic "widescreen" style of story telling, making it retain much of the visceral cinematic enjoyment that was intended as movie script.

While the origin of Daredevil had been told many times before, even once by Miller himself, ''Man Without Fear'' would widely be regarded as the "official" origin for the character.

===The Nineties===
For the character of Daredevil, the [[1990s]] were a huge disappointment.  While comic books themselves were getting a lot of attention due to their collectibility, Daredevil was largely ignored as a character, having only been well-known by avid comic book readers.

A push to regain interest in Daredevil was made in the mid-nineties in a storyline entitled "Fall From Grace" in which Daredevil's secret identity had been exposed forcing him to fake his death and change his costume (claiming that he was another person who claimed the mantle after Matt Murdock's death).  The costume, as well as the storyline, was highly criticized by fans who mocked the "bladed costume" as it tended to be called.

Soon after, Daredevil returned to the red costume and reasons were made for him to resume his identity as Matt Murdock while deceiving the public into believing Murdock and Daredevil were never the same person.  Comic book devices like this (commonly referred to as "[[retcons]]") were often used when a massive change was made to a character to increase interest (and sales) then changed back to the status quo when fans disliked the changes.

Matt and Foggy (who now knew of Matt's identity as Daredevil) joined a law firm run by a cold woman, Rosilind Sharpe, who turned out to be Foggy's birth mother (she had given Foggy up for adoption as soon as he was born so it wouldn't interfere with her law career).  Under writer Joe Kelly, the book got a lighter tone, with Daredevil going back to the wisecracking, more lighthearted hero he had once been. 

Still, the changes came too late and Daredevil was cancelled for the first time in over thirty years, but it would return almost immediately with the real push it needed to exceed all expectations.

==The Present: Marvel Knights Daredevil==
In [[1998]], [[Marvel Comics]] brought out ''Daredevil'' (vol. 2) under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.

Due to their editorial abilities in their own publishing company, [[Joe Quesada]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] had been hired by Marvel to create an imprint under their company that would be fairly autonomously controlled.  The goal of this new imprint was to revitalize once popular characters that hadn't sold well in years.  The flagship in their new launch was Daredevil to be drawn by Quesada himself with script by fan favorite, [[Kevin Smith]].

===Guardian Devil===

Smith was popular amongst the comic community for two movies he had written which celebrated comic book culture: [[Mallrats]] and [[Chasing Amy]].  However, at this point, Smith had no experience working in the comic industry aside from a few comics based on his own characters from his first film, ''[[clerks.]]'') Smith has remarked that he had called Joe Quesada at one point to cancel his commitment to writing the series, feeling he could not live up to the standard set by Frank Miller.  Soon after, however, he realized that he didn't have to be Frank Miller, and was able to write his story fairly easily.

What followed was an eight issue story entitled "Guardian Devil," which depicted Daredevil struggling to protect a child who he is told could either be the next [[messiah]] or the [[anti-Christ]].  This brings Matt to a crisis of faith that is exacerbated by the death of a loved one.  The story concluded with a single issue without any form of violence (still a rarity in superhero comics) in which Daredevil resolved his issues by talking about his feelings with his close friends, mostly superheroes including [[Spider-Man]] and [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]], who had suffered similar losses.  The storyline was massively popular, which not only re-established Daredevil as a first rate character, but also established Quesada as an intelligent editor (leading directly to his current position of Editor-in-Chief at Marvel Comics), Smith as a premier comic book writer, and paved the way for other screenwriters and novelists to write comic books including [[J. Michael Straczynski]], [[Joss Whedon]], [[Greg Rucka]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[Stephen King]], to name a few.

In the course of the story, mishaps and tragedies seemed to strike those Matt knew.  Karen (who had left town and Matt to get a job at a radio station in Los Angeles) returned, revealing she had [[AIDS]].  Foggy had a one-night stand with a client and woke up to see her as a monster.  Trying to get away, he pushed her back and she fell out a window where, fully human, she was declared dead and Foggy was arrested for murder.  When his own mother, Rosilind Sharpe, refused to let Matt represent him, Matt quit their firm.

Meanwhile, the mysterious figure who had told Matt the baby was the Antichrist was seen hiring Bullseye to get the child.  Matt, meanwhile, became more convinced the child was evil and seemed to ignore anyone telling him otherwise.  At one point, he even believed the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] was in on this scheme and beat her down.  He eventually went to see [[Dr. Strange]] who first showed that Matt was under a drug causing him to believe in the child's evil.  Strange then summoned [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] who said that there were no plans for either Christ or the Antichrist to be reborn anytime soon.  A comment from Mephisto sent Matt to his mother's church where Bullseye had viciously slaughtered the homeless residents and nuns.  A brutal fight between the two followed with Karen interfering.  Bullseye pushed her away and took the child away.  Before he went, he hurled Daredevil's billy club at him but Karen intercepted the deadly strike, the club piercing her chest.  As Bullseye escaped, Karen died in Matt's arms.

An enraged Daredevil went on the hunt and eventually came to a skyscraper owned by the mystery man.  Climbing up an elevator shaft, he suddenly found himself in a Hell-like environment with Karen among the damned.  He was rescued by a hulking figure who identified himself as Matt's [[guardian angel]] and they needed to rescue the child in order to prevent [[Armageddon]].  Matt, however, sensed something wrong and took down this "angel" revealing him to be just a man in a fancy suit.  He eventually came face to face with the mastermind behind all this: long-time Spider-Man foe, [[Mysterio]].

A year earlier, Mysterio had learned all the chemicals he'd used over the years to create his smoke and hallucinagens had caught up with him: he had a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both inoperable.  He decided if he was going to die, it would be with a bang, with a grand scheme against his greatest foe.  However, this was during the infamous Spider-Man [[Clone Saga]] and Mysterio didn't want to waste his final effort on a fake.  So he picked Daredevil, figuring (as he put it) who better to face a second-rate villain than a second-rate hero?

Mysterio went to see the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], who at the time had fallen out of power in the underworld and was trying to rebuild.  At first, the Kingpin laughed him off but when he heard Mysterio wanted to drive Daredevil mad, he was intrigued.  For a million dollars, he sold Mysterio all the info he needed on Matt Murdock.  Mysterio decided to strike through Murdock's religious upbringing.  He artificially inseminated a young virgin so she'd think her baby was divine and, after the child's birth, killed the teen and her family.  He'd hired an actress to get close to Foggy, drugging him so he'd see her as a monster and then giving the woman an overdose when she was knocked outside.  He'd also posed as the doctor who gave Karen her AIDS diagnosis, using her own porn star/drug addict past to convince her. ("Maybe she was HIV positive, maybe she wasn't.  You'd think she'd at least have gotten a second opinon.")

Daredevil finally knocks Mysterio down, shattering his helmet to reveal a pathetic figure with tubes in his nose.  Mysterio is ready to have Daredevil kill him, but he doesn't.  Instead, Daredevil points out how clichÃ¨d and unimaginative this entire thing has been and how Mysterio is just a madman instead of the artist he claims to be, nothing but "another supervillain with a bad scheme to drive your archnemesis... I'm sorry, adopted archnemesis... insane."  Mysterio is broken by his words, allowing Daredevil to get the child.  As Daredevil turns back, he finds Mysterio pointing a gun at him.  "You'll like this one, Devil.  I stole it too.  From [[Kraven the Hunter|Kraven]]."  He then turns the gun on himself and fires.

The final issue has the aftermath as Matt is unable to speak at Karen's funeral.  He meets with [[Spider-Man]] and has a long monologue about the pain of the world and the senselessness of it all.  When he demands to know what possible good came out of this, Spider-Man points out how he saved the baby's life.  Matt puts the child up for adoption with the name "Karen."  He finds out that he is the beneficiary of Karen's sizeable life insurance policy and decides to use it to rebuild Nelson & Murdock law firm.

===Parts of a Hole===
The unenviable task of following Kevin Smith was left to artist/writer [[David Mack]].  Mack was well-known within the comic community for his series [[Kabuki (comics)|Kabuki]], which often features complex painting mixing changes of perception with philosophy, poetry, and personal development.  Although he would not be drawing this storyline, Mack would offer art direction to Quesada so that the title would retain his own personal style.

"Parts of a Hole" introduced the character of Maya Lopez, a Native American woman who was born deaf, but had the ability to perfectly duplicate any movement she saw, not only allowing her to expertly play the piano and speak without any impediment, but also to copy martial arts and acrobatic moves.  Under the Kingpin's direction, Maya was led to fall in love with Matt Murdock even as she was told by him that Daredevil had killed her father.

The story was not as popular as Kevin Smith's run, due in large part to the frequent delays, which were the result of Joe Quesada's promotion to editor-in-chief.

Following that story line was a four issue story featuring Daredevil supporting character [[Ben Urich]] written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and painted by David Mack entitled "Wake Up."  Mack has remarked that although he liked working with Bendis, the experience made him realize he had no interest in drawing for someone else's script.

The six issues that followed, "Playing to the Camera" were written by ''[[Back to the Future]]'' screenwriter [[Bob Gale]] before the series would receive not only its first stable creative team in years, but also its first ongoing plotline.

===Out===
With the return of [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and the introduction of [[Alex Maleev]] to the comic industry, Daredevil gained a new style and a new voice.  Bendis neither pursued the crime noir aspect popularized by Miller nor the more superheroic style more indemic of Kevin Smith.  Instead, Bendis wrote a more realistic character oriented story featuring personality conflicts, media, and the law as central elements in developing the story.

To do this, Bendis made the decision to "out" Daredevil, and unlike previous revelations, this would have lasting consequences.  Understanding why Bendis made this decision is not difficult to figure out.  Daredevil's secret identity had become so much of a joke that in one comic, Matt is talking to three friends before he suddenly has to go stop a crime.  The three friends all knew Matt's identity, but none of them knew that each other knew and so all three tried to explain Matt's sudden departure.  Matt's identity was known to Foggy Nelson, Karen Page, Elektra, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Sister Mary, and even his worst enemy, the Kingpin, which led comic readers to continually ask "Why doesn't Kingpin just out him?" But Kingpin was a far too popular and important character to simply kill off, so the issue remained as ridiculous to readers as the idea of [[Superman]]'s glasses being an effective disguise.  By revealing Daredevil's identity, not only could Bendis dispense with this problem, but he could address the greatest fear of any superhero, losing his secret identity.

Soon after, many writers began to expose the secret identities of their heroes (including [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], and the [[X-Men]]), but in these cases, their secret identities seemed unnecessary and when they were removed, there were few lasting consequences.  By having the same creative team, Bendis was able to show the long term effects of being "outed," demonstrate the danger posed to loved ones, and show the moral gray areas a hero will enter when forced into a difficult situation.

Maleev's art was also a strong contributing factor in the book as it allowed a type of stark realism, highly contrasting Quesada's more cartoonish style, while at the same time setting mood with its harsh and grainy lines.  Muted warm tones were often added to his work to make it seem as if it were filmed with a shody documentary camera creating an enhanced sense of realism.

===Before Hardcore/King of Hell's Kitchen: Captain Universe===
Before the dark times that would soon enshroud Matt and his Daredevil persona Matt was enlisted by [[Captain Universe]] to aid him in freeing Dr. Gilbert Wiles and not only that but discover the identity of a mysterious organization that has been relentlessly following Captain Universe for years apparently. Matt soon learns that A.I.M. is responsible and hands a Class Three A.I.M. Commando over to S.H.I.E.L.D for interrogation. Matt and Captain Universe say their goodbyes with Daredevil returning to his own crime fighting while Captain Universe takes off in search of a host who can help defeat A.I.M. However in the end of this small adventure helping Gilbert Wiles and uncovering A.I.M.'s schemes are only second to the hours that Matt spent being able to see through his own two eyes again. 

===Hardcore/ King of Hell's Kitchen===
It seemed as though it was only a matter of time until Daredevil snapped under the pressure.  After being outed, he sued the Daily Planet's publisher for defamation of character.  Later, the publisher was found in his pool with his head ripped off (not cut off, ''ripped off'') with Matt Murdock as the prime suspect.  In reality, the killer was the Kingpin, no longer blind and looking to rebuild his criminal empire.  He enlisted the help of Typhoid Mary and Bullseye in his plot to kill Daredevil.  After Bullseye attacked Matt's girlfriend in her apartment, Daredevil beat him mercilessly.  He then beat the Kingpin half to death, strapped to the front of a car, drove it through the window at Josie's Bar and declared himself the new Kingpin.

The series then leaps forward a year to see the ramifications of Daredevil's actions.  After the Kingpin's fall, Daredevil became more and more violent, even beating down [[the Punisher]] for pointing a gun at him.  While crime in Hell's Kitchen hits a new low, several of Matt's superhero friends try to reason with him about his behaviour.  After nearly dying during a fight with the Yakuza, [[Ben Urich]] discovers that he is married to Milla.  He finds Matt and tells him that his new taste for violence, his taking on the mantle of his greatest enemy, his shunning of friends, and his new marriage is all the product of a [[nervous breakdown]] brought on by the unresolved feelings he harbors about the death of [[Karen Page]].  When this is explained to Milla, she annulls the marriage.

Bendis brought ''Daredevil'' to depths of darkness and tragedy not seen since ''[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]''.  After exposing Daredevil's identity, Bendis showed Daredevil coping with his life falling around him in a realistic matter.  Fans were shown a hero that was slowly going insane right before their eyes.  As more and more things happened around Matt, the more isolated and neurotic he became.  The book also limited the amount of "supervillains" used and replaced them with more realistic enemies like assassins and mafiaosi, which further added to the book's realism.

Bendis and Maleev are currently still writting the series with the conclusion to their run scheduled for January 2006. They are to be replaced by [[Ed Brubaker]].

*In the first story arc, Daredevil's girlfriend [[Karen Page]] is killed by Bullseye.
*Later, small-time crook Sammy Silke leaked Matt's Daredevil identity to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and an agent, Henry Dobbs, leaked it to the ''Daily Globe'' newspaper.  Matt averted catastrophe â€” particlarly [[disbarment]] for unethically trying cases in which Daredevil had been involved, and having any related convictions reversed â€” by suing the paper, although from that moment on, rumors about his double life never ceased.
*Foggy Nelson accused Matt that he wore the Daredevil costume out of [[masochism]], to punish himself for the many deaths he could not prevent, most notably the one of Karen Page.
*Matt beat his archnemeses Bullseye and [[Kingpin (comics)|the Kingpin]] conclusively and declared himself the "Kingpin of Hell's Kitchen", effectively succeeding Wilson Fisk as the most feared man of the underworld.
*After becoming the new Kingpin, Daredevil more and more went (figuratively) over dead bodies to enforce the law.  He became so violent that [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Mr. Fantastic]] were seriously concerned for him.
*During this period, Matt got married to Milla Donovan, a blind woman.  But as he became more and more erratic, Milla left him.
*The "Kingpin before the Kingpin", Alexander Bont, was released from jail where he blackmailed Melvin Potter into helping him tortue and attempt to kill Daredevil for sending him to prison.  Bont died and Potter was sent to prison.

==Powers==
Daredevil is completely blind, yet his other senses are beyond human; he also posseses a 360 degree radar sense, which acts independent of his other senses. His mind emits a frequency (only audible to Daredevil) that goes out into the environment, bounces off objects and returns to him giving him a "picture" of his surroundings (in much the same way bats and dolphins use their radar/sonar abilities); he can feel the imprints of ink or blood on any surface, also allowing his real identity to read in court; Daredevil can hear a person's heartbeat and tell who's who this way, he can also determine if someone is lying or not; expert martial artist, seems to fear nothing and is a cunning acrobat.

==Character analysis==
Matt Murdock is one of the most complicated characters in comic books, mostly due to the additions made by Frank Miller:

* [[Catholic]] â€” Reflecting upon the character of Daredevil, Frank Miller has said that a person so conflicted as to be both a lawyer and a vigilante must be a Catholic.  Identifying a religious affiliation was uncommon in comics as it was often seen to alienate those who were not part of that religion, though also, perhaps, because many early comic creators were Jewish.  Miller's addition of the character's Catholicism offered many opportunities to comment on the overwhelming "Catholic guilt" that would cause him to think of himself as a devil.  Kevin Smith, a Catholic himself, also utilized this aspect of the character prominently in his run on the series.

* [[Misogynistic]] â€” It has been suggested that Matt Murdock is secretly misogynistic, though he won't admit that even to himself.  This likely comes from the feeling of being abandoned by his mother at an early age.  All of his life, he has been attracted to dangerous women including Elektra (who has an addiction to danger), Black Widow (who has a curse on her that kills any man she loves), Typhoid Mary (who has [[multiple personality disorder]], her other personality being a psychotic killer), and Karen Page (who was innocent when they met, but sold his secret identity to fuel a drug habit later on).  Whether he is trying to punish himself by dating them or perhaps trying to justify some internal feelings of misogyny is difficult to say.

* Order/chaos â€” A common theme in Daredevil is his conflicting attractions to order and chaos, peace and violence, defender and attacker.  This may be caused by his father, a violent man who wanted his son to be a pacifist.  Matt's father wanted him to be a lawyer, a paragon of virtue who would never need violence, but Matt was always drawn toward adventure and could never ignore the violent realities of life.  Eventually, this split him into two personas each with their own friends and lifestyles, one a vigilante with the face of a demon, the other a respectable Catholic lawyer.  As the series goes on, these roles become too difficult to maintain separately until they come crashing together repeatedly, forcing Matt to reconcile his divided nature.

* Tragedy â€” Matt Murdock's life is practically defined by tragedy and pain.  Matt's blindness and the murder of his father led to his becoming a superhero.  Most of Matt's girlfriends are dead, usually from Matt's double life.  While many super heroes like [[Batman]] and [[Spider-Man]] deal with their fair share of loss, no other mainstream hero has had more than Daredevil.  Frank Miller has said that, with as much tragedy in Matt's life, he should be the ultimate villain.  Yet, Murdock's sense of right and wrong has made him probably the most determined hero in the Marvel Universe.  Often, these tragedies lead Murdock to brood by himself and isolate himself from others, save a small circle of friends.  Eventually, the weight of this cracked Matt's psyche during Bendis's run.  He developed a [[nervous breakdown]], beat both Bullseye and the Kingpin nearly to death, took on the mantle of the Kingpin, and hastily married a woman he barely knew.  While Matt has seemed to recover from the breakdown, tragedy still pushes Matt's life as Daredevil.

==Personal life==
Within [[Marvel Comics]], few characters feature a love life which is so convoluted and tortured as Daredevil's.  His girlfriends fall roughly into two groups: on one side, ordinary women who suffer great pain at his side â€” such as [[Karen Page]], Heather Glenn, Glorianna O'Breen and Milla Donovan â€” and on the other side, superpowered, highly dangerous love interests such as [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]], [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and [[Echo (comics)|Echo]].  Either variety, most ended up killed, maimed or traumatized.  Arguably, Daredevil is a character with a strong [[Girlfriend-in-Refrigerator Syndrome]].

{{spoilers}}
*Karen Page sold out his secret identity to [[the Kingpin]] for a shot while she was addicted to [[heroin]].  Later, she was killed right in front of him by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] while trying to protect him. Enraged, Daredevil attacked Bullseye and gave him a savage beating, nearly killing him. 
*Elektra was also killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in her first encounter with the villain, although she was revived later.
*Heather Glenn committed suicide after becoming [[alcoholic]].
*Glorianna O'Breen was killed by Victor Krueller, a henchman of the Kingpin.
*His wife Milla Donovan left him, accusing him that her marriage was a symptom of his [[nervous breakdown]].
*Typhoid Mary's love was ultimately destroyed by her [[dissociative identity disorder]].
*Echo was tricked by the Kingpin into attempting to kill Daredevil, who she was told killed her father.  Though she learned the truth, her emotional imbalance keeps them apart.
*Almost as an exception, he and the Black Widow had a relatively normal relationship, one that even saw Matt leave his home in Hell's Kitchen to move in with her in San Francisco.  However the Black Widow soon began to fear that her own career as a crime fighter was being overshadowed by the more popular Daredevil, and the two split amicably. They still remain friends and [[sexual partners]].

==Other Daredevils==
Other comic book Daredevils include:

*The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Daredevil (Golden Age)|Daredevil]], a character published by [[Lev Gleason Publications]], who wore a red-and-blue suit and fought crime with [[boomerangs]].  The [[alternate universe]] version of Matt Murdock in the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' series wore a similar costume as an homage.
*In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Daredevil remained essentially unchanged.  However, he has been portrayed as a character who is less tortured and scarred than his mainstream counterpart.  He was paired up with much more volatile characters like [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] or [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] and brought in a more responsible and mature point of view.
*Daredevil [[Marvel 2099|2099]] made one appearance in ''2099 Apocalypse''.  Although not given an origin, a proposed DD2099 title would have revealed he was a descendent of Foggy Nelson.
*Matthew Murdoch, the blind balladeer, an alternate version of Matt Murdock in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s series [[1602 (comic)|1602]].
*[[Marvel Knights]] Daredevil 2099, a descendent of [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]].
*The Devil Hunter, a version of Daredevil from the Marvel Mangaverse.  His costume is patterned after an [[oni]] or Japanese demon.
*Keeper Murdock, Daredevil's counterpart from ''The [[Age of Apocalypse]].''
*Matt Murdock, the same old Daredevil, but this time romantically involved with [[She-Hulk]] in [[House of M|'House of M']].
*In the Earth X series a completely invulnerable stuntman goes by the name of Daredevil as well as dawning a costume that looks somewhere between that of Daredevil and Evil Knievel.  It is never stated who this Daredevil really is, but the list of potential candidates includes Deadpool, Mr. Immortal, Night Raven, YI Yang, the original Daredevil's enemy, Madcap and some even suggest that he is the ressurected Foggy Nelson.

==Ultimate Daredevil==

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Daredevil is a law student at [[Columbia University]]. While little of his past is revealed, he resembles [[Marvel 616]] Daredevil in both powers and looks. His only appearance takes place in [[Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra]]. In this story, [[Ultimate Elektra]] (also a student at Columbia University) and her roomates are harrassed by a rich boy, Trey Langstrom. Elektra fights back, and in response Langstrom hires a group of thugs to destroy Elektra's father's business. Murdock, forces the thugs to confess, but can't stop Elektra from seriously wounding Langstrom. While Matt reveals his identity to Elektra, she forces him to choose between their love and his sense of duty. He chooses duty.

==Other media adaptations==

As for other media, Daredevil was the original late bloomer for Marvel with no major appearances until the [[1980s]].  There was ''Trial of the Incredible Hulk'', a [[TV movie]] that was essentially a pilot for Daredevil, played by [[Rex Smith]].  The [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] was played by [[John Rhys Davies]]. The character would also appear as a guest in the various Marvel superhero [[animated series]] from that time, as well as on the Spider-Man and Fantastic Four series of the mid-1990s. [[Bill Smitrovich]] provided Daredevil's voice on the Fantastic Four animated series while [[Edward Albert]] provided Daredevil's voice on the Spider-Man animated series. He also had a small appearance in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[Computer and video games|video game]] (where [[Dee Bradley Baker]] provided his voice) released for [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]], [[N64]], [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] and [[PC compatible|PC]].  His Matt Murdock alias also makes a cameo as the lawyer of [[Punisher|Frank Castle]] in the 2005 [[Punisher (game)|Punisher]] video game.

[[Image:Daredevil_poster.JPG|thumb|200px|right|''Daredevil'' movie poster]]
In [[2003]], a moderately high-budgeted [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'' film]], starring [[Ben Affleck]] in the title role, was greenlit by Fox Studios.  As expected by the character's fans, Frank Miller's take on the character was the guide for the filmmakers.  Thought the original production was geared towards a darker, more adult film, the success of the then just released Spider-Man prompted Fox to curb the more mature elements and re-envision the film as a summer action vehicle in mid production.  The increased budget for CGI effects and retooling of the tone was troubled and fan reaction was mixed, with much disapproval heaped upon [[Ben Affleck]], whom many fans felt was unworthy of the role.  There was also a small amount of controversy concerning the casting of African American actor Michael Clarke Duncan as the villainous Kingpin, whose traditional comic ethnicity was of Anglo-European descent.  What small amount of praise there was went mostly to Colin Farrell as the sadistic Bullseye, and Jennifer Garner as Elektra.  The reaction for Garner at the studio was so strong that Elektra was given her own film in 2004.  It is to be noted that the Elektra movie is generally regarded as a greater failure than Daredevil.  

In November 2004, a director's cut of the film was released that restored nearly 30 minutes of scenes that had been cut after studio battles between the producers and the director (the studio wanted to attempt to mimic the success of the recently released Spider-Man film).  Though not an extremely widely released DVD, this version nonetheless received much better reviews than the theatrical release of the film initially did and changed quite a few minds about the quality of the film.  While still not a perfect film, it is considered to be closer to the expectations fans had for the film.  A director's cut of Elektra is forth coming, but it is unknown if the condition will repeat for that film.

As of late, Marvel Studios' [[Avi Arad]] has mentioned that he would make a Daredevil 2 "in a second" once the rights revert back to them from 20th Century FOX.  Ben Affleck has stated that he would be interested in returning as long as negotiations were made to tell some of the darker storylines that the character is known for.
