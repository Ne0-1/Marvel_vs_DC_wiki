'''Daredevil''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[writer]]-[[Literary editor|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Bill Everett]], with an unspecified amount of input from [[Jack Kirby]],<ref name="thejackfaq4"/> and first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964).

Living in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[New York City]], '''Matt Murdock''' is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from an oncoming vehicle. While he no longer can see, the radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human ability. His father, a boxer named Jack Murdock, supports him as he grows up, though Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to [[Match fixing|throw a fight]]. After donning a yellow and black, and later a dark red, costume, Matt seeks out revenge against his father's killers as the superhero Daredevil, fighting against his many enemies including [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[Kingpin (comics)|the Kingpin]].<ref name="debut">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller=[[Bill Everett|Everett, Bill]] | Inker=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] | Story=The Origin of Daredevil | Title=Daredevil | Issue=1 | Date=April 1964 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Daredevil's nickname is "the Man Without Fear".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://shdictionary.tripod.com/superheroes/daredevil.html | title=Daredevil | work=The Superhero Dictionary | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref>

Although ''Daredevil'' had been home to the work of many legendary comic-book artists — Everett, Kirby, [[Wally Wood]], [[John Romita, Sr.]], and [[Gene Colan]], among others — [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s influential tenure on the title in the early 1980s is particularly remembered, having cemented the character as a popular and influential part of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Daredevil has since appeared in many various forms of media including several animated series, video games, merchandise, and a [[Daredevil (film)|2003 feature-length film]].

==Publication history==
{{Further2|[[List of Daredevil titles]]}}

===1960s===
The character debuted in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Daredevil'' #1 ([[cover date]] April 1964),<ref name=gcd-dd1>[http://www.comics.org/series/1636/ ''Daredevil'' (Marvel, 1964 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Bill Everett]], with character design input from [[Jack Kirby]], who devised Daredevil's billy club.<ref name="thejackfaq4"/> When Everett turned in his first-issue pencils extremely late, Marvel production manager [[Sol Brodsky]] and [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]] inked a large variety of different backgrounds, a "lot of backgrounds and secondary figures on the fly and cobbled the cover and the [[Splash panel|splash page]] together from Kirby's original concept drawing".<ref>{{Cite web | last=Quesada | first=Joe | authorlink=Joe Quesada | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011134509/http://newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays4.htm | archivedate=2007-10-11 | title=Joe Fridays 4 (column) | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=n.d., circa May 2005}}</ref>

Writer and comics historian [[Mark Evanier]] has concluded (but cannot confirm) that Kirby designed the basic image of Daredevil's costume, though Everett modified it.<ref name="thejackfaq4"/> The character's original costume design was a combination of black, yellow, and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights.<ref name="debut"/> [[Wally Wood]], a highly regarded artist known for his 1950s [[EC Comics]] stories, penciled and inked issues #5-10, introducing Daredevil's modern red costume in issue #7.<ref name="writers">{{Cite web | url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/ddWRITERS.shtml | title=Daredevil: The Man Without Fear - Writers | work=The Man Without Fear | accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref>

Issue #12 began a brief run by Jack Kirby (layouts) and [[John Romita, Sr.]] The issue marked Romita's return to superhero penciling after a decade of working exclusively as a [[Romance novel|romance]]-comic artist for DC. Romita had felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker. He recalled in 1999,
{{bquote|I had inked an ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' job for Stan, and I told him I just wanted to ink. I felt like I was burned out as a penciller after eight years of romance work. I didn't want to pencil any more; in fact, I couldn't work at home any more — I couldn't discipline myself to do it. He said, 'Okay,' but the first chance he had he shows me this Daredevil story somebody had started and he didn't like it, and he wanted somebody else to do it.<ref name="romitainterview">Interview: {{Cite journal | url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06romita.html | title=John Romita Sr.: Spidey's Man | publisher=(interview), ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' | issue=6 | date=Fall 1999|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5nfeiAQpY|archivedate=February 19, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>}}

Romita later elaborated that,
{{quote|Stan showed me [[Dick Ayers]]' splash page for a ''Daredevil''. He asked me, "What would you do with this page?" I showed him on a tracing paper what I would do, and then he asked me to do a drawing of Daredevil the way I would do it. I did a big drawing of Daredevil ... just a big, tracing-paper drawing of Daredevil swinging. And Stan loved it.<ref name="fiftyyears">[[John Romita, Sr.]], interviewed by former Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]]: {{Cite journal | url=http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/09romita.html | title=Fifty Years on the 'A' List | journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | volume=3 | issue=9 | date=July 2001 | accessdate=2009-05-02|archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/5nDrfbxRP |archivedate=February 1, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>}}

When Romita left to take over ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', Lee gave ''Daredevil'' to what would be the character's first signature artist, [[Gene Colan]], who began with issue #20 (Sept. 1966).<ref name=gcd-dd1 /><ref name="howgraphicnovelswork">{{Cite book | last=Wolk | first=Douglas | title=Reading Comics: How Graphic Novels Work, and What They Mean | publisher=Da Capo Press | date=July 2, 2007 | page=405 | isbn=978-0-306-81509-6 | accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> Though #20 identifies Colan as a fill-in penciller, Romita's work load prevented him from returning to the book,<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=Tom |authorlink= |title=Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan |url= |year=2005 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn= |page= 74}}</ref> and Colan ended up penciling all but three issues through #100 (June 1973), plus the 1967 annual, followed by ten issues sprinkled from 1974–1979. (He would return again, an established legend, for an eight-issue run in 1997).<ref name="howgraphicnovelswork"/>

Lee never gave Colan a full script for an issue of Daredevil; instead, he would tell him the plot, and Colan would tape record the conversation to refer to while drawing the issue, leaving Lee to add the script in afterwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=Tom |authorlink= |title=Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan |url= |year=2005 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn= |page= 58}}</ref> Though Colan is consistently credited as penciler only, Lee would typically give him the freedom to fill in details of the plot as he saw fit. Lee explained "If I would tell Gene who the villain was and what the problem was, how the problem should be resolved and where it would take place, Gene could fill in all the details. Which made it very interesting for me to write because when I got the artwork back and had to put in the copy, I was seeing things that I'd not expected."<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=Tom |authorlink= |title=Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan |url= |year=2005 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn= |page= 61}}</ref> The 31-issue Lee/Colan run on the book included Daredevil #47, in which Murdock defends a blind [[Vietnam veteran]] against a [[frameup]]; Lee has cited it as the story he is most proud of out of his entire career.<ref>(1991). The Very Best of Marvel Comics [trade paperback].</ref> With issue #51, Lee turned the writing chores over to [[Roy Thomas]] (who succeeded him on a number of Marvel's titles), but would remain on board as editor for another 40 issues.

The first issue covered both the character's origins and his desire for justice on the man who had killed his father, boxer "Battling Jack" Murdock, who raised young Matthew Murdock in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Jack instills in Matt the importance of education and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from the vehicle. The radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human thresholds, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him. In order to support his son, Jack Murdock returns to boxing under the Fixer, a known gangster, and the only man willing to contract the aging boxer. When he refuses to throw a fight because his son is in the audience, he is killed by one of the Fixer's men. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronts the killers as the superhero Daredevil, unintentionally causing the Fixer to have a fatal heart attack.<ref name="debut"/>

Daredevil would embark on a series of adventures involving such villains as the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]]. In issue #16 (May 1966), he meets [[Spider-Man]], a character who would later be one of his greatest hero friends.<ref name="daredevilvol1#16">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller=[[John Romita, Sr.|Romita, John, Sr.]] | Inker=[[Frank Giacoia|Giacoia, Frank]] | Story=Enter...

Murdock reveals his secret identity to his girlfriend [[Karen Page]] in issue #57, although she leaves the series after the revelation proves too much for her.<ref name="daredevilvol1#57">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller=[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | Inker=[[Syd Shores|Shores, Syd]] | Story=In the Midst of Life...! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=57 | Date=October 1969 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> This was the first of several long-term breakups between Murdock and Page, who would prove the most enduring of his love interests.

===1970s===
18-year-old [[Gerry Conway]] took over as writer with issue #72, and turned the book in a pulp [[science fiction]] direction: a lengthy story arc centered on a robot from thousands of years in the future trying to change his timeline, and even long-standing arch-villain the Owl was outfitted with futuristic weaponry and vehicles. His run on the book stood out due to his occasional use of implied sexual intercourse, which was shocking to readers at the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Steve Gerber]] came on board with issue #97, initially scripting over Conway's plots, but Gene Colan's long stint as Daredevil's penciler had come to an end. Gerber recollected, "Gene and I did a few issues together, but Gene was basically trying to move on at that point. He'd just started [[Tomb of Dracula|the ''Dracula'' book]], and he'd been doing ''Daredevil'' for God knows how many years. I think he wanted to do something else."<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=Tom |authorlink= |title=Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan |url= |year=2005 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn= |page= 115}}</ref> After six issues with fill-in pencilers, including several with [[Don Heck]], [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] took over as penciller.

[[Tony Isabella]] succeded Gerber as writer, but editor [[Len Wein]] disapproved of his take on the book and sent him off after only five issues, planning to write it himself.<ref>Mithra, Kuljit (May 1997). [http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Isabella Interview with Tony Isabella], manwithoutfear.com.</ref> Instead, he ended up handing both writing and editing jobs to his friend [[Marv Wolfman]] with issue #124, which also introduced inker [[Klaus Janson]] and letterer [[Joe Rosen]] to the book. Rosen would work on 127 issues of the comic (more than any other Daredevil creator) over 16 years. Wolfman's 20-issue run included the introduction of one of Dardevil's most popular villains, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], and a fondly remembered story arc in which [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|the Jester]] uses computer-generated images to hoodwink the mass media. However, he was disatisfied with his work and quit, later explaning, "I felt DD needed something more than I was giving him. I was never very happy with my DD--I never found the thing that made him mine the way Frank Miller did a year or two later. So I was trying to find things to do that interested me and therefore, I hoped, the readers. Ultimately, I couldn't find anything that made DD unique to me and asked off the title."<ref>Mithra, Kuljit (November 1997). [http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Wolfman Interview with Marv Wolfman], manwithoutfear.com.</ref> His departure coincided with Brown's death from [[leukemia]].

With issue #144, the book was handed to writer [[Jim Shooter]] and a series of short-term pencilers, including [[Gil Kane]], who had been penciling most of Daredevil's covers since #80 but had never before worked on the comic's interior. The series's once solid sales began dropping during this period, and was downgraded to bi-monthly status with issue #147. However, Shooter still had difficulty keeping up with the book's schedule, and the writing chores were shortly turned over to [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]].<ref name="ShooterInt">Mithra, Kuljit (July 1999). [http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Shooter Interview with Jim Shooter], manwithoutfear.com.</ref>

McKenzie's work on Daredevil reflected his background in horror comics, and the stories and even the character himself took on a much darker tone: Daredevil battled a personification of death,<ref name="daredevilvol1#156">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Roger McKenzie (comics)|McKenzie, Roger]] | Penciller=[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | Inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | Story=Ring of Death! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=156 | Date=January 1979 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> one of his archenemies was bifurcated by a tombstone,<ref name="daredevilvol1#158">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Roger McKenzie (comics)|McKenzie, Roger]] | Penciller=[[Frank Miller (comics)|Miller, Frank]] | Inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | Story=A Grave Mistake! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=158 | Date=May 1979 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and a re-envisioning of Daredevil's origin showed him using stalker tactics to drive the Fixer to his fatal heart attack.<ref name="daredevilvol1#164">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Roger McKenzie (comics)|McKenzie, Roger]] | Penciller=[[Frank Miller (comics)|Miller, Frank]] | Inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | Story= Exposé | Title=Daredevil | Issue=164 | Date=May 1980 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> McKenzie also created chain-smoking ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' reporter [[Ben Urich]], who deduces Daredevil's secret identity over the course of issues #152-163, and had Daredevil using the criminal underworld of Hell's Kitchen as an information network, adding several small-time crooks to the supporting cast.

Halfway through his run, McKenzie was joined by penciler [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] (who had previously drawn Daredevil in the February 1979 installment of ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #27). Miller's imbued a new dynamism and a dramatically different visual style,{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} and helped McKenzie turn the series' tone to that of [[Hardboiled|noir]] with [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] itself playing a more prominent role. 

Daredevil moved to [[San Francisco]] for a time beginning with ''Daredevil'' #81 to live with his new love interest, the spy and superheroine the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. From #92 through #107, the cover logo was retitled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''. She ends the relationship in issue #124, fearing that playing "[[sidekick]]" is sublimating her identity. Murdock returns to Hell's Kitchen. The lively but emotionally fragile Heather Glenn almost immediately replaced the Black Widow as his love interest. In a story arc overlapping Wolfman, Shooter, and McKenzie's runs on the book, Daredevil reveals his identity to Glenn and becomes partially responsible for the suicide of her father; their relationship would persist, but would prove increasingly harmful to both of them. Though the Black Widow returned for a dozen issues (#155-166) and attempted to rekindle her romance with Daredevil, he ultimately rejects her in favor of Glenn.

===1980s===
Sales had been declining since the end of the Wolfman/Brown run, and by the time Miller became Daredevil's penciler, the series was in danger of cancelation. Nor did Miller see himself as the series's potential savior; he disliked Roger McKenzie's scripts, and Jim Shooter (who had since become Marvel's editor-in-chief) had to talk him out of quitting.<ref name="ShooterInt"/> Seeking to appease Miller,<ref name="ShooterInt"/> and impressed by a short backup feature he had written, new editor [[Denny O'Neil]] fired McKenzie so that Miller could write the series.<ref name="O'NeilInt">Mithra, Kuljit (February 1998). [http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil Interview with Dennis O'Neil], manwithoutfear.com.</ref> The decision was made so abruptly that the last issue of McKenzie's run plugs a two-part story which never appeared (though part one eventually saw print in Daredevil #183).

Comics artist legend [[Wally Wood]], following kidney failure and the loss of vision in one eye, returned to the character he helped define, inking Miller's cover of ''Daredevil'' #164 (May 1980). It was one of Wood's final assignments before his death in 1981.

Miller continued the book in a similar vein to McKenzie. Resuming the drastic metamorphosis the previous writer had begun, Miller took the step of essentially ignoring all of Daredevil's continuity prior to his run on the series; on the occasions where older villains and supporting cast were used, their characterizations and history with Daredevil were reworked or overwritten. Most prominently, dedicated and loving father Jack Murdock was reimagined as a drunkard who [[physical abuse|phsyically abused]] his son Matt, entirely revising Daredevil's reasons for becoming a lawyer.<ref name="daredevilvol1#191">{{Cite comic | Writer=Miller, Frank | Penciller=[[Frank Miller (comics)|Miller, Frank]] | Inker=[[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]] | Story= Roulette | Title=Daredevil | Issue=191 | Date=May 1980 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] was introduced as as Daredevil's new arch-nemesis, displacing most of his large rogues gallery. Daredevil himself was gradually developed into an [[antihero]]. In issue #181, he attempts to murder one of his arch-enemies by throwing him off a tall building; when the villain survives as a [[quadriplegiac]], he breaks into his hospital room and tries to scare him to death by playing a two-man variation on [[Russian roulette]] with a secretly unloaded gun.<ref name="daredevilvol1#191"/> Miller's revamping of the title was controversial among fans, but it clicked with new readers, and sales began soaring,<ref name="ShooterInt"/> the comic returning to monthly status just three issues after Miller came on as writer.

Miller also introduced [[ninja]]s into the Daredevil canon, bringing a [[martial arts]] aspect to Daredevil's fighting skills, and introducing previously unseen characters who had played a major part in his youth: [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], leader of the ninja clan the [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste]], who had been Murdock's [[sensei]] after he was blinded; a rival clan called the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]; and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], an ex-girlfriend turned lethal ninja assassin. This was a drastic change for a character once called "the sightless [[swashbuckler]]". <!--following is POV; needs a cite: The focus of a ninja's control of the inner self served as a counterbalance to the emerging themes of anger and torment.-->

With #185, inker Janson began doing the pencils over Miller's layouts, and in #191 Miller left the book entirely. O'Neil switched hats from editor to writer. O'Neil was not enthusiastic about the switch, later saying "I took the gig mostly because there didn't seem to be (m)any other viable candidates for it."<ref name="O'NeilInt"/> He continued McKenzie and Miller's noir take on the series, but backed away from the antihero depiction of the character by having him not only spare Bullseye's life, but express guilt over his two previous attempts to kill him. Janson left shortly after Miller, replaced initially by penciler William Johnson and inker Danny Bulanadi, who were both supplanted by [[David Mazzucchelli]]. In 1986, Miller returned to the series, co-writing #226 with O'Neil, then writing the acclaimed "[[Daredevil: Born Again]]" storyline in #227-233. Karen Page, who had not been seen since Marv Wolfman's run a decade before, returned as a heroin-addicted [[porn]] star, and sells Daredevil's secret identity for drug money. The Kingpin aquires the information and in an act of revenge, orchestrates a frameup which costs Murdock his attorney's license. Miller ended the arc on a positive note, with Murdock reuniting with both Karen Page and Maggie, the mother he thought dead, now a nun.

Three fill-in issues followed before [[Steve Englehart]] (under the [[pseudonym]] "John Harkness"){{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} took the post of writer, only to lose it after one issue due to a plot conflict with one of the fill-ins. [[Ann Nocenti]] was brought on as a fill-in writer but became the series's longest-running regular writer, with a four-and-a-quarter year run from #238-291 (Jan. 1987 - April 1991). The shuffle of short-term artists continued for her first year, until [[John Romita, Jr.]] joined as penciller from #250-282 (Jan. 1988 - Jul. 1990) alongside inker [[Al Williamson]], who stayed on through #300.

The team returned Murdock to law by co-founding with Page a nonprofit drug and legal clinic, while Nocenti crafted stories confronting [[feminism]], [[drug abuse]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[animal rights]]-inspired [[terrorism]]. She introduced the antagonist [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], and in issues #262-265 used [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|the Inferno event]] as a backdrop for the collapse of Daredevil's life: The clinic was destroyed, Page went missing after learning of his affair with Mary Walker, and Walker revealed herself as the alter ego of Typhoid Mary. Murdock subsequently became a [[drifter (person)|drifter]] in [[upstate New York]], an especially controversial move in Nocenti's run, as it marked the first time he had been taken outside of an urban environment. She ended her run with a positive turn in Murdock's fortunes: He returned to Hell's Kitchen, regained his sense of self, reconciled with Foggy Nelson, and resolved to seek out Karen Page.

===1990s===
New writer [[D. G. Chichester]] and [[penciler]] [[Lee Weeks]] continued from where Nocenti left off, with Murdock resuming his friendship with [[Foggy Nelson]], struggling to re-win the heart of Karen Page, appealing the revocation of his attorney's license, and bonding more deeply than ever with Hell's Kitchen. Chichester's focus on Daredevil's relationship with New York City went so far as to have two issues devoted entirely to Daredevil defending New Yorkers from ordinary criminals and even simple accidents. The critically acclaimed "Last Rites" arc from #297-300 saw Daredevil regaining his attorney's license and finally bringing the Kingpin to justice.

The creative team of Chichester and penciler [[Scott McDaniel]] changed the status quo with their "Fall From Grace" storyline in issues #319-325 (Aug. 1993 - Feb. 1994). [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], who was resurrected in #190 but had not been seen since, finally returned. An injured Daredevil creates a more protective costume from biomimetic materials: red and grey with white armor on the shoulders and knee pads. Revamped billy clubs could attach to form [[nunchucks]] or a [[bo staff]]. His secret identity became public knowledge, leading to him faking his own death and assuming the new identity of "Jack Baitlan". This new identity and costume lasts for several story arcs ("Tree of Knowledge", "Humanity's Fathom", and "Wages of Sin"), while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a double). A short stint by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] returned Daredevil to his traditional red costume and Matt Murdock identity.

Under writers [[Karl Kesel]] and later [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], the book gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and Foggy (who now knows of Matt's dual identities) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother, Rosalind Sharpe. Gene Colan returned to the series during this time, but though initially enthusiastic about drawing Daredevil again, he quit after seven issues, complaining that Kesel and Kelly's scripts were too "[[retro]]".<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=Tom |authorlink= |title=Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan |url= |year=2005 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn= |page= 149}}</ref>

[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] returned to the character and his origins with the 1993 five-issue ''Daredevil: The Man Without Fear'' [[miniseries]]. With artist [[John Romita Jr.]], Miller expanded his [[retcon]] of the life and death of Murdock's father, "Battling Jack" Murdock, and Murdock's first encounters with the Kingpin and Foggy Nelson.<ref name="man without fear">{{Cite book | first=Frank | last=Miller | authorlink=Frank Miller (comics) | coauthors=[[John Romita, Jr.]] | title=Daredevil: The Man Without Fear | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | date=April 1993}}</ref> The role of [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] in the genesis of Daredevil was expanded, as was Murdock's doomed love affair with Elektra.

In 1998, ''Daredevil'''s numbering was rebooted, with the title "canceled" with issue #380 and revived a month later as part of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint. [[Joe Quesada]] drew the new series, written by filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]]. Its first story arc, "[[Guardian Devil]]", depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the [[Messiah]] or the [[Anti-Christ]]. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has [[AIDS]] (later revealed to be a hoax) and her subsequent death at [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s hands.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #8 (June 1999)</ref>

Smith was succeeded by writer-artist [[David W. Mack|David Mack]], who contributed the seven-issue "Parts of a Hole" (vol. 2, #9-15). The arc introduced Maya Lopez, also known as [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], a [[deaf]] martial artist. Mack brought [[Alternative comics|independent-comics]] colleague [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to Marvel to co-write the following arc, "Wake Up" (vol. 2, #16-19), which follows reporter [[Ben Urich]] as he investigates the aftereffects of a fight between Daredevil and the new [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]]. Following Mack and Bendis were ''[[Back to the Future]]'' screenwriter [[Bob Gale]] and artists [[Phil Winslade]] and David Ross for the story "Playing to the Camera". Mack continued to contribute covers.

===2000s===
The 2001 ''Daredevil: Yellow'' miniseries presented another take on Daredevil's origins using letters written to Karen Page after her death. Here Page believes she is in love with both Daredevil and Murdock, and Nelson with Karen Page, resulting in a silent rivalry between the two men. The supervillains the Owl and the [[Purple Man]] are the [[antagonist]]s. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase "The Man without Fear", and she also suggests to Daredevil he wear red instead of black and yellow.

Issue #26 (Dec. 2001) brought back [[Brian Michael Bendis]], working this time with artist [[Alex Maleev]], for a four-year-run that became one of the series' most acclaimed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<!--following is POV: Maleev's harsh and grainy look contrasted to Quesada's more cartoony lines.--> Developments in this run included the introduction of romantic interest and future wife [[Milla Donovan]], the outing once again of Murdock's secret identity, the reemergence of the Kingpin, and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI.

The impact of his exposure as Daredevil continued to be used as a plot point by both Bendis and writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Michael Lark]], who became the new creative team with ''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #82 (Feb. 2006), no longer under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.

Murdock finds himself renewed in the miniseries ''Daredevil: Reborn'' #1-4 (March–July 2011).

In July 2011, Daredevil relaunched with vol. 3 #1 (Sept. 2011), with the creative team of writer [[Mark Waid]] and penciler [[Paolo Rivera]]. Waid said he was interested in "tweaking the adventure-to-depression ratio a bit and letting Matt win again,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://westfieldcomics.com/blog/interviews-and-columns/interview-mark-waid-on-marvels-daredevil/ |title=Interview: Mark Waid on Marvel’s Daredevil |author=Ash, Roger |work=Westfield Comics Blog |accessdate=30 May 2011 }}</ref> as well as emphasizing the character's powers and perception of the physical world.<ref name=cbr25788>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32338 |title=Waid, Rivera & Martin Give the "Daredevil" His Due |author=Richards, Dave |date=16 May 2011 |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=30 May 2011 }}</ref> In the premiere issue, Murdock finds he can no longer serve as a trial lawyer due to past allegations of his being Daredevil causing a case he represents in court to turn into a media circus.

==Powers and abilities==
Although blind, the character's remaining four senses function with high levels of superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person; few know that the hero cannot see. Daredevil developed a sonar sense,<ref name="historyradar">{{Cite web | url=http://www.theothermurdockpapers.com/2009/03/history-of-radar-sense-4-frank-miller.html | title=A History of the Radar Sense #4 - Frank Miller, Part 1 | date=March 21, 2009 | work=The Other Murdock Papers | accessdate=2009-04-29 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090629002733/http://www.theothermurdockpapers.com/2009/03/history-of-radar-sense-4-frank-miller.html |archivedate=2009-06-29}}</ref> which is similar to [[Human echolocation|echolocation]]. According to Stan Lee, due to the fact that Murdock's sensory organs have a superhuman level of development, his inner ear, which controls the equilibrium and motions of the body, is also preternaturally developed, aiding him in acrobatic feats that surpass even [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athletes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

When [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] expanded most of Daredevil's abilities, he attempted to make them "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with [[Superman]]", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers.<ref name="historyradar"/> When Miller joined the title in 1979, the first thing he did to the character was "revamp" his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the "proximity" sense that most martial artists claim to have.<ref name="historyradar"/> Because of this, he created an ability for Daredevil to hear the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s heartbeat four blocks away. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing his fingers over the letters on a page.<ref name="historyradar"/> (though laminated pages prevent him from reading the ink<ref>''Daredevil: Reborn'' #1</ref>) Daredevil has also commonly used his superhuman hearing to serve as a lie detector for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat. However, this ability can be fooled if the other person's heart is not beating at a natural rate, such as if they have a [[pacemaker]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Frank Miller (comics)|Miller, Frank]] | Penciller=Miller, Frank | Inker=[[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]] | Story=Good Guys Wear Red | Title=Daredevil | Issue=184 | Date=July 1982 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

However, just as Daredevil's other senses are stronger, they are also sensitive; his main weakness is his vulnerability to powerful sounds or odors that can be used to temporarily weaken his radar sense.<ref name="daredevilv1#159">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Roger McKenzie (comics)|McKenzie, Roger]] | Penciller=[[Frank Miller (comics)|Miller, Frank]] | Inker=[[Glynis Wein|Wein, Glynis]] | Story=Marked for Murder! | Title=Daredevil | Issue=159 | Date=July 1979 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> This weakness is often used to immobilize Daredevil if he were bombarded by too much sound, which will cause him great pain and disorient him.<ref name="daredevilv2#3">{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Kevin Smith|Smith, Kevin]] | Penciller=[[Joe Quesada|Quesada, Joe]] | Inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti|Palmiotti, Jimmy]] | Story=Dystopia | Title=Daredevil | Volume=2 | Issue=3 | Date=January 1999 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Additionally Daredevil needs to detect something with his radar to know it is there or it will remain invisible to him, which makes it possible to have something get past his radar if he is unable to detect it. In one instance the hallucinogenic drug that [[Mysterio]] created was designed with no taste or smell so Daredevil could not tell he was drugged until he consulted [[Doctor Strange]] who was able to discover it from the small cross that Mysterio gave to Daredevil in disguise which contained the drug and magically cured him.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Kevin Smith|Smith, Kevin]] | Penciller=[[Joe Quesada|Quesada, Joe]] | Inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti|Palmiotti, Jimmy]] | Story=Devil's Despair | Title=Daredevil | Volume=2 | Issue=5 | Date=March 1999 | Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> When Daredevil fought [[Psylocke]] during the [[Avengers vs. X-Men|war between the Avengers and the X-Men]], he briefly gained an advantage when she tried to read his mind and found herself overwhelmed by the sensory input he received from his enhanced senses, reflecting the scale of psychological training required for Daredevil to operate as he does.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Remender, Rick ; Andrews, Kaare |artist=Peterson, Brandon; Andrews, Kaare |story=Daredevil vs. Psylocke; The Mighty Thor vs. Emma Frost |title=Avengers vs. X-Men: Versus |issue=4 |date=July 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref>

Though he has no superhuman ''physical'' attributes beyond an enhanced sense of balance, Daredevil is a master of martial arts.<ref name="irvineonnoir">{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20665 | title=The Man Who Would Be King(pin): Irvine on Daredevil Noir | last=Richards | first=Dave | date=April 3, 2009 | work=Comic Book Resources | accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref> Having been trained by [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], Daredevil is a master hand-to-hand combatant. His typical moves are unique blends of the martial arts of [[Ninjutsu]], [[Aikijujutsu]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Kung Fu]],  [[capoeira]], [[Judo]], [[Aikido]], [[wrestling]] and [[stick fighting]] combined with American-style [[boxing]] while making full use of his gymnastics capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/s/stick.htm | title=Stick | work=Marvel Directory | accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>

Daredevil's signature weapon is his specially-designed billy club, which he created.<ref name="daredevilv1#159"/> Disguised as a blind man's cane in civilian garb, it is a multi-purpose weapon and tool that contains thirty feet of aircraft control cable connected to a case-hardened steel [[grapnel]]. Internal mechanisms allow the cable to be neatly wound and unwound, while a powerful spring launches the grapnel. The handle can be straightened for use when throwing. The club can also be split into two parts, one of which is a fighting baton, the other of which ends in a curved hook.<ref name="thejackfaq4">{{Cite web | url=http://www.povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq4.htm | title=The Jack F.A.Q. - Page 4 | last=Evanier | first=Mark | work=PovOnline | accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref><ref name="daredevilv1#159"/>

In his civilian identity, Murdock is a skilled and respected attorney with an encyclopedic knowledge of law, especially New York statutes. He is also a skilled detective, tracker, and interrogation expert, as well as being an expert marksman.

===Daredevil enemies===
{{Main|List of Daredevil enemies}}
In his early years, Daredevil fought a number of costumed supervillains, the first of these being [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], a prominent Spider-Man foe, in ''Daredevil'' #2. A number of recurring villains would be introduced over the years, such as the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #3</ref> the [[Purple Man]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #4</ref> [[Mister Fear]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #6</ref> [[Stilt-Man]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #8</ref> [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #18</ref> [[Jester (Jonathan Powers)|The Jester]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #43</ref> The [[Man-Bull]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #78</ref> [[Death-Stalker]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #113</ref> and various others. The supervillain duo of the [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]] and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mr. Hyde]] have also frequently clashed with Daredevil, although Hyde has fought Daredevil alone on several occasions. One of his deadliest enemies, a psychotic assassin known as [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], was introduced by [[Marv Wolfman]] in issue #131, and the two have battled each other many times over the years.

Beginning with Frank Miller's run on ''Daredevil'', his traditional rogues gallery was used less often, and [[The Kingpin]] became Daredevil's arch-enemy. The Kingpin has long known Daredevil's secret identity, and used this information to try to destroy Murdock's life. Elektra made her debut as a bounty hunter for hire, leading to several confrontations with Daredevil. In ''Daredevil '' #254, [[Ann Nocenti]] introduced [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], an assassin for the Kingpin with an [[dissociative identity disorder|identity disorder]], who also became a prominent Daredevil foe. The [[Punisher]], vigilante Frank Castle, is one of Daredevil's most prolific antagonists and at times a reluctant ally.
