'''Daredevil''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #1 (April 1964) and was created by [[writer]]-[[Literary editor|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Bill Everett]], with an unspecified amount of input from [[Jack Kirby]]. <ref name="r1"> Comics historian and former [[Jack Kirby]] assistant [[Mark Evanier]], investigating claims of Kirby's involvement in the creation of both [[Iron Man]] and Daredevil, interviewed Kirby and Everett on the subject, years before their deaths. In his column [http://povonline.com/jackfaq/JackFaq4.htm P.O.V. Online: The Jack FAQ: "What did Jack do on the first stories of Iron Man and Daredevil?"], he concluded that, "in both cases, Jack had already drawn the covers of those issues and done some amount of design work. He ... seems to have participated in the design of Daredevil's first costume. ... Everett did tell me that Jack had come up with the idea of Daredevil's billy club. ... Jack, in effect, drew the first page of that first Daredevil story. In the rush to get that seriously late book to press, there wasn't time to complete Page One, so Stan had [production manager] [[Sol Brodsky]] slap together a paste-up that employed Kirby's cover drawing. ... Everett volunteered to me that Jack had "helped him" though he wouldn't — or more likely, couldn't — elaborate on that. He just plain didn't remember it well, and in later years apparently gave others who asked a wide range of answers".

Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] later noted in his ''Newsarama''  column [http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays4.htm "Joe Fridays Week 4" (2005, no other date given)] that when Everett turned in his first-issue pencils extremely late, Brodsky and [[Spider-Man]] artist [[Steve Ditko]] inked "a lot of backgrounds and secondary figures on the fly and cobbled the cover and the splash page together from Kirby's original concept drawing".</ref> Daredevil is notable as being among the few superheroes with a [[disability]], being [[blindness|blinded]] as a youth in a [[radioactive]] accident that also drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a "radar-sense" allowing him to perceive his surroundings.<!--The 1940s Golden Age Daredevil was originally mute, and Dr. Mid-Nite was blind. Marvel's DD is one of the few, but not one of the first. Marvel's own Professor X even precedes him. --> His civilian identity is [[lawyer]] '''Matt Murdock'''.

Although ''Daredevil'' had been home to the work of many legendary comic-book artists — Everett, Kirby, [[Wally Wood]], [[John Romita, Sr.]], and [[Gene Colan]], among others — it is [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s influential tenure on the title in the late 1970s and early 1980s that is best remembered, cementing the character as a popular and influential part of the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
=== 1960s ===
The character first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964) and was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett. The first issue covered both his origins and his desire for revenge on the men who had killed his father, [[boxing|boxer]] "Battling Jack" Murdock.

Matthew Murdock is raised by single father in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of [[New York City]]. Jack instills in Matt the importance of education and nonviolence with the aim of seeing his son become a better man than himself. In the course of saving a blind man from the path of an oncoming truck, Matt is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from the vehicle. The radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human thresholds, enabling him to detect the shape and location of objects around him.<ref name = "yrommu">''Daredevil'' #1</ref> In order to support his son, Jack Murdock returns to boxing and when he refuses to throw a fight is killed by gangsters. Adorned in a yellow and black costume made from his father's boxing robes, renamed with the moniker of his childhood derision, and using his superhuman abilities, Matt confronts the killers and avenges his father as the superhero Daredevil. <ref name = "yrommu">''Daredevil'' #1</ref> 
 
Daredevil's original costume was a combination of black, yellow and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights, and went through minor revisions in issues #2 through #4 by [[EC Comics]] artist [[Joe Orlando]]. Fellow acclaimed EC veteran Wally Wood penciled #5-8, introducing the modern, completely red costume in issue #7. [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] great [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]] ([[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]]) penciled two issues over Wood layouts, and they then swapped for #11, which Wood inked over Powell's pencils.

Issue #12 began a brief run by Jack Kirby (layouts) and [[John Romita, Sr.]] It was Romita's return to superhero penciling after a decade of working exclusively as a [[Romance novel|romance]]-comic artist for DC. Romita had felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker.<ref>Romita, from ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #6 (Fall 1999) [http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/06romita.html]: "I had inked an ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' job for Stan, and I told him I just wanted to ink. I felt like I was burned out as a penciller after eight years of romance work. I didn't want to pencil any more; in fact, I couldn't work at home any more — I couldn't discipline myself to do it. He said, 'Okay,' but the first chance he had he shows me this Daredevil story somebody had started and he didn't like it, and he wanted somebody else to do it." Elaborating in ''Alter Ego'' #9 (July 2001) [http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/09romita.html], he added, "Stan showed me [[Dick Ayers]]' splash page for a ''Daredevil''. He asked me, "What would you do with this page?" I showed him on a tracing paper what I would do, and then he asked me to do a drawing of Daredevil the way I would do it. I did a big drawing of Daredevil ... just a big, tracing-paper drawing of Daredevil swinging. And Stan loved it."</ref>

When Romita left to take over ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', Lee gave ''Daredevil'' to the character's first signature artist, [[Gene Colan]], who began with issue #20 (Sept. 1966). Colan pencilled all but three issues through #100 (June 1973), plus the 1967 annual, followed by ten issues sprinkled from 1974-79. (He would return again, an established legend, for an eight-issue run in 1997). 

Daredevil embarks on a series of colorful adventures involving such villains as the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]], [[Stilt-Man]], the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], and the [[Enforcers]].  Daredevil's early exploits were often large, [[swashbuckling]] adventures, and sub-plots involved [[romantic triangle]]s between Matt, Karen and Foggy and cases of [[mistaken identity]]. He also meets [[Spider-Man]] during this time.<ref>''Daredevil'' #16</ref>

Much like in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' — and in what was already an established hallmark of Marvel Comics storytelling — interpersonal drama was as central to the series as action and adventure. A triangle of unrequited love develops between Foggy Nelson, Karen Page and Murdock, with Nelson unable to win over Page and Matt unable to admit that Page loves anyone other than Daredevil. Among the notable plot developments during this period were Matt Murdock's panicky creation of a "twin brother", the "sighted" and devil-may-care Mike Murdock, in #25 (Feb. 1967), whom Karen Page and Foggy Nelson are led to believe is Daredevil; "Mike's" death in #41 (June 1968); and Matt revealing his Daredevil identity to Karen Page in #57 (Oct. 1969). When the revelation of Murdock's dual identity proves too much for Page, she leaves the firm and the comic.

=== 1970s ===

In the 1970s the title featured a double billing, co-starring Daredevil's girlfriend, the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]].The narrative had Daredevil move to [[San Francisco]] for a time to live with the spy and super-heroine the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], and enters into a romantic relationship with her<ref>''Daredevil'' #81</ref> but she soon ends the relationship, fearing that playing "[[sidekick]]" to Daredevil is sublimating her identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #124</ref> Murdock returns to Hell's Kitchen. During this time, the series' writers included [[Gerry Conway]], [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Chris Claremont]].  Artists included [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] and [[Don Heck]]. 

Comics-artist legend [[Wally Wood]], following kidney failure and the loss of vision in one eye, returned to the character he helped define, inking Miller's cover of ''Daredevil'' #164 (May 1980). It was one of Wood's final assignments before his death in 1981.

=== 1980s ===
[[Image:Dd181.png|thumbnail|left|''Daredevil''  #181 (April 1982). Cover art by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Klaus Janson]].]]

The modern definition of ''Daredevil'' began in 1979 with [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s entrance on the title.  Miller's first contributions were as an artist, where he imbued a new dynamism and a dramatically different visual style.  The series' tone became that of [[noir]] with [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] itself playing a more prominent role.

With issue #168, Miller additionally became the series' writer, and the comic underwent a drastic metamorphosis. The most significant change was the introduction of [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] as Daredevil's new arch-nemesis. Until that point, Daredevil's enemies were primarily, though not exclusively, costumed villains. The Kingpin was a departure in that although he possessed extraordinary size, strength and fighting ability, his villainy came from his ruthless brilliance in running a criminal empire, rather than superpowers. The title still retained costumed antagonists — notably [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] — but found its central theme to be one more grounded in reality: [[organized crime]].

Miller also introduced [[ninjas]] into the Daredevil canon, bringing a greater focus on the [[martial arts]] aspect of Daredevil's fighting skills, and introducing the characters [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. This was a drastic change to a character once considered a swashbuckler. The focus of a ninja's control of the inner self served as a counterbalance to the emerging themes of anger and torment. 

Daredevil encounters the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] for the first time, and the two battle each other.<ref>''Daredevil'' #131</ref> Eventually, Daredevil's secret identity is deduced by the reporter [[Ben Urich]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #164</ref> 

Daredevil encounters the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], who has hired his old flame Elektra as an assassin, and Daredevil battles her.<ref>''Daredevil'' #168</ref> He returns to his former mentor [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] for aid.<ref>''Daredevil'' #176</ref> Bullseye then murders Elektra in a fight to determine the better killer. Taking revenge, Daredevil drops Bullseye from a clothesline high above a street,<ref>''Daredevil'' #181</ref>  Daredevil allies with the [[Punisher]] against drug pushers.<ref>''Daredevil'' #182-184</ref> Daredevil battles the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], and Elektra is briefly resurrected.<ref>''Daredevil'' #190</ref>

Miller's noir take on the character continued, even after he left (in 1983, after issue #191). However, successor [[Dennis O'Neil]] did not find the commercial success of his predecessor. In late 1985, Miller returned to the series, co-writing #226 with O'Neil, then writing the acclaimed  "[[Daredevil: Born Again]]" storyline in #227-233 (Feb.-Aug. 1986), with artist [[David Mazzuchelli]]. Karen Page eventually returns as a heroin-addicted star of [[adult films]], who sells Daredevil's secret identity for drug money. The Kingpin uses this information to destroy Murdock piece by piece: blowing up his house, ruining his reputation as a lawyer, getting him disbarred, menacing his personal life and nearly driving him insane.<ref>''Daredevil'' #227</ref> Matt suffers a nervous breakdown.<ref>''Daredevil'' #228-230</ref> Miller ends the story on a positive note, with Murdock reuniting with Karen Page as his sometime lover,<ref>''Daredevil'' #231</ref> and the mother he thought dead, now a nun, and resuming a less complicated life in Hell's Kitchen. <ref>''Daredevil'' #233</ref> 

A [[round-robin]] of creators contributed in the year that followed ''Born Again'': writers [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Danny Fingeroth]], [[Steve Englehart]] (under the [[pseudonym]] "John Harkness") and [[Ann Nocenti]], and pencilers [[Steve Ditko]], [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], Louis Williams, [[Sal Buscema]], [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Keith Pollard]],and Chuck Patton. [[Longshot]] co-creator Nocenti, who'd written #236, became the regular writer for a four-and-a-quarter year run of all but two issues from #238-291 (Jan. 1987 - April 1991). [[John Romita, Jr.]] joined as penciller from #250-282 (Jan. 1988 - Jul. 1990), and was generally inked by [[Al Williamson]]. The team specifically addressed societal issues, with Murdock, now running a non-profit urban legal center, confronting [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[nuclear proliferation]] while fighting supervillains. Nocenti introduced the popular antagonist [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] in issue #254.

=== 1990s ===

Daredevil's secret identity becomes public knowledge {{when}}. Forced to fake his own death and change his uniform to an armored "razor costume", Murdock undergoes one of his numerous breakdowns. The change does not last, and Daredevil soon returns to his traditional red costume, while Murdock finds a way to convince the world that he is not, in fact, secretly Daredevil (courtesy of a [[deus ex machina]] [[doppelgänger]]).

Under writers [[Karl Kesel]] and later [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], the book gained a lighter tone, with Daredevil returning to the lighthearted, wisecracking hero depicted by earlier writers. Matt and [[Foggy Nelson|Foggy]] (who now knows of Matt's dual identities) join a law firm run by Foggy's mother, Rosalind Sharpe.

[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] returned to the character and his origins with the 1994 five issue mini-series ''Man without Fear''. With artist John Romita Jr, expanded upon the characters beginnings and provide additional detail about the life and death of "Battling Jack" Murdock and Matt's first encounters with the Kingpin and Foggy Nelson.  <ref name="man without fear">{{cite book|author=Frank Miller| authorlink =Frank Miller (comics)|coauthors =[[John Romita Jr.]]| title =Daredevil: The Man Without Fear| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|date=1993-4}}</ref> The role of [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] in the genesis of daredevil is expanded up as Murdock's doomed love affair with [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], the daughter of a [[Greece|Greek]] diplomat.

[[Image:Ddsmith.png|thumbnail|left|The death of [[Karen Page]]. Promotional art for ''Daredevil Visionaries: [[Kevin Smith (film maker)|Kevin Smith]]'' by [[Joe Quesada]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]].]]
In 1998, ''Daredevil'''s numbering was rebooted, with the title "canceled" and revived a month later as part of the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint. [[Joe Quesada]] drew the new series, written by filmmaker [[Kevin Smith (film maker)|Kevin Smith]].  Its first eight-issue story arc, "[[Daredevil: Guardian Devil|Guardian Devil]]" depicts Daredevil struggling to protect a child whom he is told could either be the [[Messiah]] or the [[Anti-Christ]]. Murdock experiences a crisis of faith exacerbated by the discovery that Karen Page has [[AIDS]] (later revealed to be a hoax), and her subsequent death at [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s hands. <ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #8 (June 1999)</ref>

After "Guardian Devil", Smith was succeeded by writer-artist [[David Mack]], who contributed the seven-issue "Parts of a Hole" (#9-15). This arc introduces Maya Lopez, also known as [[Echo (comics)|Echo]], a [[deaf]] martial artist.  Mack brought [[Alternative comics|independent-comics]] colleague [[Brian Michael Bendis]] to Marvel for the following arc, "Wake Up" (#16-19), which follows reporter [[Ben Urich]] as he investigates the aftereffects of a fight between Daredevil and an obscure old villain called [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leapfrog]]. Following Mack and Bendis were ''[[Back to the Future]]'' screenwriter [[Bob Gale]] and artists [[Phil Winslade]] and David Ross for the story "Playing to the Camera". Mack continued to contribute covers.

===2000s===


The 2001 mini-series ''Daredevil: Yellow'' presented another take on Daredevil's origins using letters written to Karen Page after her death as a narrative device. Here Page believes she is in love with both Daredevil and Murdock, and Nelson with Karen Page, resulting in a silent rivalry between the two men. The supervillains the Owl and the Purple Man are the [[antagonists]]. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase "The Man without Fear", and she also suggest to Daredevil he wear red instead of black and yellow.

Issue #26 (Dec. 2001) brought back [[Brian Michael Bendis]], working this time with artist [[Alex Maleev]], for a four-year-run that became one of the series' most acclaimed. Maleev's harsh and grainy look is in contrast to Quesada's more cartoony lines, and distinctively reads like a marriage of Frank Miller's [[film noir]] style and the [[Pulp magazine|pulp-magazine]] art of the 1920s and '30s. Developments in this run included the introduction of romantic interest and future wife Milla Donovan, the outing of Murdock's secret identity to the press, the reemergence of the Kingpin, and Daredevil's surrender to the FBI.

The impact of his expose as Daredevil continued to be used as a plot point by both Bendis and Writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Michael Lark]] who became the new creative team with ''Daredevil'' #82 (Feb. 2006), no longer under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint.

[[Image:Ddif.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Danny Rand as Daredevil. Art by [[Michael Lark]].|frame]]
Brubaker's first story on the title saw Murdock imprisoned by the FBI through the machinations of the Kingpin, Foggy Nelson apparently murdered and a mysterious new Daredevil appears in Hell's Kitchen.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #87 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Murdock escapes with the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] during a prison riot and discovers the ersatz Daredevil to be his friend, [[Heroes for Hire|Hero for Hire]] Danny Rand, the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. It is revealed that Rand has been manipulated by Kingpin's wife, Vanessa Fisk, who was behind both Nelson's attack and the substitute Daredevil. Unbeknownst to Murdock, Nelson is in the [[Witness Protection Program]]. At the conclusion of the arc, the characters are reunited and Murdock's secret identity is reintroduced. <ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #89-93 (Nov. 2006 - March 2007)</ref> 

Over the next couple of arcs, Brubaker would make use of  older characters such as [[Mister Fear]] and the [[Enforcers]] and newer ones such as [[Hood (comics)|The Hood]],<ref>Daredevil vol. 2 #95-103 (May 2007- January 2008)</ref> and his own creation [[Lady Bullseye]].

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Daredevil takes part in the fight against the Skrulls.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
{{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}}
Although blind, the character's remaining four senses function with high levels of superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person. Daredevil can "see" by means of a type of "radar sense" that allows him to sense the proximity of people and objects around him. Daredevil's radar sense is connected with his hearing (thus it is technically a form of [[sonar]], using sound rather than radio waves), as the bouncing of sounds and vibrations off his surroundings enable him to "see" what's happening around him. 

Though he has no superhuman physical attributes, Daredevil has great natural strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes, due to both extensive training and the heightened sense of balance his superhuman hearing affords him. He has shown himself to be a superb acrobat with abilities that are superior to those of an Olympic-level sighted gymnast. Daredevil's training by Stick has made him into a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. His typical moves are unique blends of the martial arts of [[Ninjutsu]], [[Jujutsu]], and [[Judo]] combined with American-style [[Boxing]] while making full use of his gymnastics capabilities.

Daredevil's signature weapon is his specially-designed billy club, which he created. Disguised as a blind man's cane in civilian garb, it is a multi-purpose weapon and tool that contains thirty feet of aircraft control cable connected to a case-hardened steel [[grapnel]]. Internal mechanisms allow the cable to be neatly wound and unwound, while a powerful spring launches the grapnel. The handle can be straightened for use when throwing. The club can also be split into two parts, one of which is a fighting baton, the other of which ends in a curved hook. 

Some stories have depicted Daredevil's suit as being made of a metal mesh as well as being insulated.

As Matt Murdock, Daredevil is a highly skilled criminal defense attorney with an extensive knowledge of the American legal system, even going so far as to defend some of his former adversaries in court.

==Characters==
===Love interests===


Within [[Marvel Comics]], few characters endure a love life as convoluted and tortured as Daredevil's. His girlfriends fall roughly into two groups: ordinary women who suffer great pain at his side; and super-powered, highly dangerous love interests. Either way, most end up killed, maimed or traumatized, a narrative aspect some media critics refer to as "[[Women in Refrigerators (comics)|Women in Refrigerators]]" syndrome.
