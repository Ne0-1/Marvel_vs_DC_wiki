'''Maelstrom''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character first appears in ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #71 (Jan. 1981), and was created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]].

==Fictional character biography==
Maelstrom is the son of [[Phaeder]], an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] scientist banished from their city of [[Attilan]] for attempting [[cloning]] to increase Inhuman population numbers. Phaeder then lived among the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], and bred with a Deviant female named Morga who gave birth to Maelstrom. With his father's tutoring, Maelstrom became a  brilliant geneticist. After his father is incapacitated in an experiment, Maelstrom swears revenge on the Inhuman race.

Maelstrom has first contact with Earth's metahumans when he sends his superpowered minions - Phobius, Gronk and Helio - to the island Hydrobase to steal an Anti-Terrigen mist compound, which can undo the effects of the [[Terrigen Mist]] and deprive the Inhumans of their abilities. Maelstrom's minions, however, are defeated by the heroes the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]] and two [[Inhumans]], [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] and [[Karnak]]. This leads to an encounter with another of Maelstrom's minions - [[Deathurge]] - who kills the defeated trio. [[Mr. Fantastic]] and the Inhuman [[Triton]] deduce that their opponent may have originated from the old site of Attilan, which was an undersea location.

The Thing, Gorgon and Karnak travel via submarine to the old location, and discover a base where they are subsequently captured. The heroes later escape and together with the Inhuman king [[Black Bolt]] battle Maelstrom. The heroes hold off Maelstrom while Black Bolt intercepts and defuses a missile carrying the anti-Terrigen mist compound that is programmed to destroy Attilan. The Thing weakens Maelstrom by using the compound on the villain, and the heroes escape as the base self-detonates. Maelstrom's last act is to order Deathurge to kill him. <ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #71 - 72 (Jan - Feb 1981)</ref>

Maelstrom and his minions, however, are later revealed to be alive, as courtesy of advanced science their minds were transferred into new, cloned bodies. Maelstrom then attempts to stop the Earth's rotation and absorb the kinetic energy, but is drawn into conflict with the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The android [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] discovers a way to overload Maelstrom's power source and his body becomes discorporate and floats free from Earth. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #250</ref>

Maelstrom later encounters the [[Eternal (comics)|Titanian  Eternal]] [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]], and learns of the existence of the entity [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. Becoming Oblivion's [[avatar]], Maelstrom then becomes determined to achieve Oblivion's goal of non-existance on a universal scale. This brings Maelstrom into conflict with the agent of the entity [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]], the cosmic hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. After several battles Quasar finally defeats Maelstrom when caught off-guard, and his own power consumes him. <ref>''Quasar'' #19 - 25 (Feb - Aug 1991)</ref> Maelstrom is later revived by his minions, but learns he had a son [[Ransak the Reject|Ransak]] that would have been wiped from existance had he succeeded. An ashamed Maelstrom shrink himself out of sight, <ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #10 (1998)</ref> but eventually returns to battle the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], who are powerless to stop him. After killing several members of the team, Maelstrom is finally tricked and beaten by the quirky hero [[Mr. Immortal]]. <ref>''GLA:Misassembled'' #1 - 4 (2005)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Maelstrom can manipulate kinetic energy, and can absorb literally any attack and use the energy for his own purposes, such as strength enhancement, energy projection, force field creation and size shifting. Maelstrom is also a genius in the scientific disciplines of biology and genetics.
