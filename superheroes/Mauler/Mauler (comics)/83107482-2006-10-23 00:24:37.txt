'''Mauler''' is a name used by three [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  "MAULER" is also an anagram for the suit of [[power armor]] the characters wore, standing for '''M'''obile '''A'''rmored '''U'''tility '''L'''aser-guided '''E'''-beam, '''R'''evised.

The armor was developed by [[Cord Conglomerate]], under contract with the [[United States]] Government.  The first wearer of the suit was disgruntled Cord employee '''Aaron Soamess'''(Daredevil v1 #167), but it was later stolen and used by a small-time thug, '''Turk Barrett'''.  Because of these and other breaches of security at Cordco facilities, the [[Department of Defense]] cut their funding, and Cordco was eventually bought up by [[Stark International]].  Mercenary '''Brendan Doyle''' was contacted by an imprisoned Cordco CEO and instructed to steal the armor and destroy all records of it.  Doyle did succeed in stealing the suit, but was prevented from completing his assignment by [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]].  Later, during the '''''[[Armor Wars]]''''' saga, Doyle surrendered the Mauler suit to Stark without a fight, realizing he could not win against [[Iron Man]].

Brendan Doyle used the armor later in the service of one [[Daniel Steyr]]. Steyr wanted to obtain [[Spider-man]]'s webbing so that he could create better armor for law enforcement and the military. Brendan was told to wait during a function that Steyr's company was going to have for the police, which would "sponsor" something bigger and better than Spider-man's webbing. It was to be held by then part-time [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]], [[Wonder Man]]. Spidey was intrigued and asked [[J. Jonah Jameson]] for permission to come, which Jameson granted. During the proceedings, Spider-Man and Wonder Man were attacked by Doyle. The two joined forces and managed to stop Doyle, who left after Steyr died saving a police officer's life. 

==Powers & abilities==
The Mauler [[power armor]] provided protection from physical and energy attacks, boosted the wearer's strength and stamina to superhuman levels, and slightly boosted the wearer's reflexes/coordination.  Internal life support systems could keep a wearer functional for several days.  Electric, air-breathing [[turbine]]s in the calves allowed the wearer to fly.  On the right arm, a solid state [[laser]] cannon was mounted, as well as an electron [[Particle beam|particle gun]] (which used the laser cannon in short-pulse mode as a guide).  The left palm could generate a high-frequency electric shock.
