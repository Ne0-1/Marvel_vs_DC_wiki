==Biography==
===Aaron Soames===
Aaron Soames, the first Mauler, was an elderly, former [[employee]] of Cord Conglomerate deprived of his [[pension]] benefits by a computer error. Soames stole the [[prototype]] suit of Mauler armor in the hopes of punishing [[Edwin Cord]], who was indifferent to Soames' plight. Soames had two skirmishes with the hero Daredevil, and after humiliating Cord by symbolically erasing his existence as well (he did not intend to do him any actual harm), he was killed with advanced weaponry by Cord's men. Daredevil was one of the few mourners at Soames' funeral.<ref>''Daredevil'' #167 (Nov. 1980)</ref>

===Turk Barrett===
The Mauler armor reappears when small-time criminal Turk Barrett steals the armor and attempts to kill Daredevil. Barrett, however, is defeated in seconds.<ref>''Daredevil'' #176 (Nov. 1981)</ref>

===Brendan Doyle===
Later, [[Mercenary]] Brendan Doyle is hired by the now imprisoned Edwin Cord to steal the armor from [[Stark International]] (the company of Iron Man's [[alter ego]], [[Tony Stark]]) and destroy all records of the suit design and history. Although successful in stealing the suit, Doyle is prevented from reaching the records by former comrade [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]], and decides to keep the suit.<ref>''Iron Man'' #156 (March 1982)</ref> As a soldier for hire, Doyle battles the heroes [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wonder Man]]<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #136 (Dec. 1983)</ref> and encounters Spider-Man once again while trying to retrieve his infant son.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #122 (Jan. 1987)</ref> Doyle reappears during the [[Armor Wars]] when the Mauler armour [[confiscated]] by the hero (who is tracking down [[technology]] based on his stolen designs).<ref>''Iron Man'' #225 (Dec. 1987)</ref>

In addition to internal life support systems, a [[laser]] cannon that doubles as an [[electron]] [[Particle beam|particle gun]] is mounted on the left arm. The right palm of the armor can also generate a high-frequency [[electric shock]].
