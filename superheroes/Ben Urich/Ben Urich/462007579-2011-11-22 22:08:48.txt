'''Ben Urich''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], usually appearing in [[comic book]]s featuring [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]]. Created by [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]] and [[Gene Colan]], he first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #153 ([[1978#July|July 1978]]).

Urich is a chain-smoking, tough-as-nails [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] for the [[New York City|New York]] [[newspaper]] ''[[The Daily Bugle]].'' Urich deduced the secret identity of Daredevil and has used him as a source of information and vice versa. To a lesser extent, he has a similar relationship with Spider-Man, whose [[alter ego]] Peter Parker was a photographer for the ''Bugle'' who occasionally accompanied Urich on assignments. Urich has used these connections to expose [[supervillain]]s posing as businessmen, including the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and [[Green Goblin]].

==Fictional character biography==
Urich first appeared in ''Daredevil'' stories, where he investigated Wilson Fisk, a businessman who was secretly the Kingpin, the head of the New York [[mafia]]. 

Urich plays a vital behind-the-scenes role in the [[Punisher]] limited series ''Circle of Blood'' (drawn by [[Mike Zeck]]). When a younger, less experienced Punisher mistakenly believes his quest of killing the Kingpin is over, he leaves a message for Urich. The resulting story results in the murders of several mafia men and the deaths of many innocent people, teaching the entire community how vital Kingpin unfortunately is.

Later, Urich was also responsible for outing Norman Osborn as the [[Green Goblin]] in a book titled ''Legacy Of Evil'', although after Osborn's presumed death. During the course of research for the book, Ben helped Spider-Man and the [[Molten Man]] save [[Liz Allan]]'s son from kidnappers who resembled the Green Goblin. His research helped the trio go through the Goblin's history and eventually discover what had really gone on. When Norman returned from the dead (or rather, Europe) he was able to discredit Urich and the book, going through great effort to clear his name.

During the period where Daredevil's identity was exposed in print, Ben refused to confirm it to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] on the principle of protecting his sources and his status at work suffered for it.  However, Jameson was able to move beyond that argument when he assigned Ben to the new supplement, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''. During this assignment he reveals to Peter Parker that he knows his identity as Spider-Man. It is also around this time that Matt Murdock sets up a meeting with Ben to privately announce that he is ending their professional relationship to avoid for anyone else to discover this connection and using Ben to get to Murdock.<ref>Daredevil Vol. 2 #35</ref>

Ben Urich turned out to be right when he originally exposed the Green Goblin, as ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' research would show, and conclusively when the Green Goblin was publicly unmasked by [[Luke Cage]] and sent to jail. Plans for a re-release of ''Legacy of Evil'' were discussed at that point; however, nothing further has yet been mentioned in any subsequent story arc of any title. Although the Green Goblin is currently at large again, he can no longer walk around free as he was before.

Later, Ben was approached by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to act as journalist covering the Kingpin brokering a deal with the [[FBI]] for release and reinstatement of his wealth, in exchange for proof that Daredevil is in fact Matt Murdock. To Ben's horror, he was the one that was forced to lead the FBI to Daredevil's location. Matt Murdock was recovering at the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]]'s clinic, of which Ben Urich knew the location (he had written an article on her), and he was forced to give that information to the FBI, thanks to the manipulation of the Kingpin.

===''Civil War''===

During Marvel's summer crossover event ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Ben is one of the main characters in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'', covering [[Iron Man]]'s side as an [[embedded journalist]] on behalf of the ''Bugle''. However, his neutrality is called into question after a confrontation with the Green Goblin, who was supposed to be in prison at the time but had been secretly released as part of one of Iron Man's plans. After insisting to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] that it was him, Ben is fired.  

In ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #4, Ben reveals to his friend [[Sally Floyd]], that seeing the [[Silver Surfer]] during the alien's first visit to earth causes him to realize that mankind is not alone in the universe. This drove him into alcoholism for about a year.

In the end of ''Civil War: Front Lines'', Ben leaves the ''Daily Bugle'', with Jameson's blessing and understanding, and forms the online newspaper Frontlines.com with [[Sally Floyd]]. They later form the print newspaper ''Front Line''.

===''World War Hulk''===
During Marvel's next crossover event ''[[World War Hulk]]'', Ben and Sally, in their capacity as the new editorial staff of ''Front Line'', are two of the few reporters who cover the alien invasion in close proximity.<ref>''World War Hulk Front Line'' (2007)</ref> During the course of those events, Sally Floyd learns that ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' editor [[J. Jonah Jameson|Jonah Jameson]] was the mysterious financial backer of the publication, a fact which they agreed to hide from Urich, lest it kill his spirit.<ref>''World War Hulk Front Line'' #6 (Dec. 2007)</ref>

Ben Urich tries to uncover the identity of the [[Red Hulk]]. Red Hulk appears before Urich and threatens to destroy those he works with if the story ever sees print.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #600 (July 2009)</ref>

===''Secret Invasion''===
During the invasion, Ben was covering a story in a local hospital, only to be trapped inside during the Skrull attacks. He survives, though a new-found nurse friend and all the others inside are killed by rampaging Skrulls. Ben and many other human refugees make their way to [[Stark Tower]], though few are aware a human-hunting Skrull with a large body count hides within. The Skrull perishes via human trickery and Ben and one of the Stark Tower survivors wander the city. The duo witness the climatic battle against the Skrulls in [[Central Park]].<ref>"Secret Invasion: Front Line" #1-4</ref>

He finds out after the invasion ends, that his wife has died, and hits both an incredible depression and writer's block. After taking some time off, and seeing the city begin to recover, starts to recover himself. However, he then gets word of Norman Osborn's rise to power, and confronts him at the press conference announcing the control of the Thunderbolts Initiative over SHIELD and the Avengers, and confronts Obsorn on his past, only to get brushed off by Osborn, and the crowd around cheering for Osborn. This ultimately breaks Urich's writers block, prompting him to write his return article: "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: Norman Osborn Takes Control".<ref>Secret Invasion: Front Line #5</ref>

===''Siege''===
Following a superpowered disaster in Chicago, Ben teams up with his old friend Bill Stern a disgraced former news reporter who rescues him from police custody. By coincidence they find [[Volstagg]] of the [[Warriors Three]], who was involved in the disaster. The trio travels to Oklahoma, intent on covering Osborn's [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]]. All three end up separating and encountering each other again and again, due to Osborn's attacks on Asgard. Ben is almost eaten by the current version of Venom during a press junket near the battle itself. Volstagg saves Ben and Bill from the explosive effects of the HAMMER helicarrier crashing down. All three work to save and evacuate Asgardians with Ben leading the effort. Ben sees the heroes defeat the menace of the Sentry's alter-ego the Void. When Norman Osbord tries to escape, Volstagg captures him with a knock-out blow. Ben and Bill return to New York as colleagues while Volstagg works at Soldier's Field to rebuild.<ref>''Siege: Embedded'' #1-4 (2010)</ref>

===''Shadowland''===
In ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Ben is forced by gang members to write about Bullseye's funeral. He manages to leave his notebook in Essex County Morgue. Daredevil finds it and leads a rescue mission. The funeral service is interrupted by Daredevil and the Hand, as a massive brawl breaks out, almost killing Ben.<ref>''Shadowland: Bullseye'' (2010)</ref>

He submitted incriminating evidence on the Kingpin to court (given to him by Peter Parker), and Kingpin had to leave the country.
