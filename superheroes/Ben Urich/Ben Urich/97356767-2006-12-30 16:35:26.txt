'''Ben Urich''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], usually appearing in [[comic book]]s featuring [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]]. Created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], he first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #153 ([[1978#July|July 1978]]).

Urich is a chain-smoking, tough-as-nails [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] for the [[New York City|New York]] [[newspaper]] ''[[The Daily Bugle]].'' Urich deduced the secret identity of Daredevil and has used him as a source of information and vice versa. To a lesser extent, he has a similar relationship with Spider-Man, whose [[alter ego]] Peter Parker is a photographer for the ''Bugle.'' Urich has used these connections to expose [[supervillain]]s posing as businessmen, including the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and [[Green Goblin]]. 

==Character history==
Urich first appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''Daredevil'' stories, where he investigated Wilson Fisk, a businessman who was secretly the Kingpin, the head of the New York [[mafia]].

Later, Urich was also responsible for outing Norman Osborn as the [[Green Goblin]] in a book titled 'Legacy Of Evil', although after Osborn's presumed death . When Norman returned from the dead (or rather, Europe) he was able to discredit Urich and the book, going through great effort to clear his name.

During the period where Daredevil's identity was exposed in print, Ben refused to confirm it to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] on the principle of protecting his sources and his status at work suffered for it.  However, Jameson was able to move beyond that argument when he assigned Ben to the new supplement, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''.

Ben Urich turned out to be right when he originally exposed the Green Goblin, as [[Daily Bugle]] research would show, and conclusively when the Green Goblin was unmasked in public and sent to jail. Plans for a re-release of 'Legacy of Evil' were discussed at that point; However, nothing further  has yet been mentioned in any subsequent story arc of any title. Although the Green Goblin is currently at large again, he can no longer walk around free like he was before.

Later, Ben was approached by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to act as journalist covering the Kingpin brokering a deal with the [[FBI]] for release and reinstatement of his wealth, in exchange for proof that Daredevil is in fact Matt Murdock. To Ben's horror, he was the one that was forced to lead the FBI to Daredevil's location. 

Matt Murdock was recovering at the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]]'s clinic, of which Ben Urich knew the location (he had written an article on her), and he was forced to give that information to the FBI, thanks to the manipulation of the Kingpin.

During Marvel's summer crossover event [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Ben is one of the main characters in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'', covering [[Iron Man]]'s side as an [[embedded journalist]] on behalf of the Bugle. However, his neutrality is called into question after a confrontation with the Green Goblin, one of the many villains drafted into the [[Thunderbolts]] army, and the death of [[Bill Foster|Goliath]] in the hands of the clone of Thor.

==Ben Urich in MC2==
Although Ben's nephew, Phil Urich, is active in this reality, Ben is not shown.  However, Felicity Hardy is seen reading a book entitled ''His Name was Spider-Man'', written by Ben.

==Ultimate Ben Urich==

In [[Ultimate Marvel]] Continuity, Ben Urich is a somewhat younger top reporter at the Daily Bugle who works with Peter Parker. He wrote a series of articles that took down Kingpin and received a book deal because of the project. He submitted incriminating evidence on the Kingpin to court, and Kingpin had to leave the country. He was attacked by a vampire in Ultimate Spider-Man #95; as of Issue #96, however, [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Ultimate Morbius|Ultimate Morbius]] appears to have cured his potential vampirism.

==Appearances in other media==
*Ben Urich appeared in the 2003 [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'' feature film]], played by [[Joe Pantoliano]]. In the film he works for the ''[[New York Post]]'', as the rights to the ''Bugle'' were tied to the ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' films. He discovers Daredevil's secret identity during his investigations (Urich is one of the few people who believe Daredevil to be anything other than an urban myth), but, when faced with the possibility of printing the story, he decides to delete it, realising that Daredevil does a great deal of good in the city.

*The novel ''[[The Intuitionist]]'' by [[Colson Whitehead]] included an investigative reporter named Ben Urich whose fingers were broken by thugs, just as [[The Kingpin]] threatened during the "[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]" storyline.
