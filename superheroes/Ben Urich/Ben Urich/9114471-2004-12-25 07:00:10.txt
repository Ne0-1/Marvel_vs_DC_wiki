'''Ben Urich''' is a [[fictional character]] existing in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe]], usually appearing in [[comic book]]s featuring [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]].  

He is a top reporter for the [[Daily Bugle]].  Urich uncovered the [[secret identity]] of Daredevil but didn't publish his story revealing it because he did not want to end Daredevil's career as a hero.  He also frequently works with Peter Parker on stories for the Bugle and he later admitted that he figured out Peter's secret identity as well. 

During the period where Daredevil's identity was exposed in print, Ben refused to confirm it to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] on the principle of protecting his sources and his status at work suffered for it.  However, Jameson was able to move beyond that argument when he assigned Ben to the new suppplement, ''[[The Pulse]]''.
