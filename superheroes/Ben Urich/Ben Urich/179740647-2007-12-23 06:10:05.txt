'''Ben Urich''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], usually appearing in [[comic book]]s featuring [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]]. Created by Roger McKenzie, he first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #153 ([[1978#July|July 1978]]).

Urich is a chain-smoking, tough-as-nails [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] for the [[New York City|New York]] [[newspaper]] ''[[The Daily Bugle]].'' Urich deduced the secret identity of Daredevil and has used him as a source of information and vice versa. To a lesser extent, he has a similar relationship with Spider-Man, whose [[alter ego]] Peter Parker was a photographer for the ''Bugle'' who occasionally accompanied Urich on assigments. Urich has used these connections to expose [[supervillain]]s posing as businessmen, including the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and [[Green Goblin]]. 

==Character history==
Urich first appeared in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''Daredevil'' stories, where he investigated Wilson Fisk, a businessman who was secretly the Kingpin, the head of the New York [[mafia]]. 

Urich plays a vital behind-the-scenes role in the [[Punisher]] limited series ''Circle of Blood'' (drawn by [[Mike Zeck]]). When a younger, less experienced Punisher mistakenly believes his quest of killing the Kingpin is over, he leaves a message for Urich. The resulting story results in the murders of several mafia men and the deaths of many innocent people, teaching the entire community how vital Kingpin unfortunately is.

Later, Urich was also responsible for outing Norman Osborn as the [[Green Goblin]] in a book titled 'Legacy Of Evil', although after Osborn's presumed death. During the course of research for the book, Ben helped Spider-Man and the [[Molten Man]] save [[Liz Allan]]'s son from kidnappers who resembled the Green Goblin. His research helped the trio go through the Goblin's history and eventually discover what had really gone on. When Norman returned from the dead (or rather, Europe) he was able to discredit Urich and the book, going through great effort to clear his name.

During the period where Daredevil's identity was exposed in print, Ben refused to confirm it to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] on the principle of protecting his sources and his status at work suffered for it.  However, Jameson was able to move beyond that argument when he assigned Ben to the new supplement, ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]''. During this assignment he reveals to Peter Parker that he knows his identity as Spider-Man.

Ben Urich turned out to be right when he originally exposed the Green Goblin, as [[Daily Bugle]] research would show, and conclusively when the Green Goblin was unmasked in public and sent to jail. Plans for a re-release of 'Legacy of Evil' were discussed at that point; However, nothing further  has yet been mentioned in any subsequent story arc of any title. Although the Green Goblin is currently at large again, he can no longer walk around free like he was before.

Later, Ben was approached by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to act as journalist covering the Kingpin brokering a deal with the [[FBI]] for release and reinstatement of his wealth, in exchange for proof that Daredevil is in fact Matt Murdock. To Ben's horror, he was the one that was forced to lead the FBI to Daredevil's location. 

Matt Murdock was recovering at the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]]'s clinic, of which Ben Urich knew the location (he had written an article on her), and he was forced to give that information to the FBI, thanks to the manipulation of the Kingpin.

===Civil War===

During Marvel's summer crossover event [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Ben is one of the main characters in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'', covering [[Iron Man]]'s side as an [[embedded journalist]] on behalf of the Bugle. However, his neutrality is called into question after a confrontation with the Green Goblin, whom is currently in prison. After insisiting to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] that it was him, Ben is fired.  

In [[Civil War: Front Line]] #4, Ben reveals to his friend [[Sally Floyd]], that seeing the [[Silver Surfer]] during his first visit to earth causes him to realize that mankind is not alone in the universe, this drives him into alcoholism for about a year.

In the end of Civil War: Front Lines, Ben leaves the Daily Bugle, with Jameson's blessing and understanding, and forms the online newspaper Frontlines.com with [[Sally Floyd]].

==Alternate versions==
===House Of M===
The Daily Bugle is a propaganda machine for the ruling mutant class. Urich is seen encouraging fellow reporter [[Kat Farrell]] to write what the people in charge want.

===MC2===
Although Ben's nephew, Phil Urich, is active in this reality, Ben is not shown.  However, Felicity Hardy is seen reading a book entitled ''His Name was Spider-Man'', written by Ben.

===Ultimate Ben Urich===

In [[Ultimate Marvel]] Continuity, Ben Urich is a somewhat younger top reporter at the Daily Bugle who works with Peter Parker. Parker, as Spider-Man, sometimes feeds him information. He wrote a series of articles that took down Kingpin and received a book deal because of the project. He submitted incriminating evidence on the Kingpin to court (given to him by Peter Parker), and Kingpin had to leave the country. He was attacked by a vampire in Ultimate Spider-Man #95; as of Issue #96, however, [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Ultimate Morbius|Ultimate Morbius]] appears to have cured his potential vampirism.

==Appearances in other media==
*Ben Urich appeared in the 2003 [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'' feature film]], played by [[Joe Pantoliano]]. In the film he works for the ''[[New York Post]]'', as the rights to the ''Bugle'' were tied to the ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' films. He discovers Daredevil's secret identity during his investigations (Urich is one of the few people who believe Daredevil to be anything other than an urban myth), but, when faced with the possibility of printing the story, he decides not to publish it, realizing that Daredevil does a great deal of good in the city.

*The novel ''[[The Intuitionist]]'' by [[Colson Whitehead]] included an investigative reporter named Ben Urich whose fingers were broken by thugs, just as [[The Kingpin]] threatened during the "[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]" storyline.
