The '''High Evolutionary''' is a [[fictional character]] who is published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''Thor'' (Vol.1) #134 (November 1966). 

==Character biography==
Herbert Edgar Wyndham was a geneticist in the [[1930s]] who, with the assistance of a disguised [[Mister Sinister]], as well as that of a disguised [[Maelstrom (comics) | Maelstrom]], discovered the secrets of [[DNA]].  Wyndham used this knowledge to alter his own genetic structure, thus becoming the ageless High Evolutionary.  He then went on to artificially mutate (or "evolve") a number of animals into a [[humanoid]] form.  He designated these mutates "New Men".

Due to the perceived immorality of his goal to make [[humanity]] the supreme lifeform in the universe (a goal decided upon by the abduction of his created world, ''Counter-Earth'', by a race known as the Beyonders), the High Evolutionary came into conflict with a number of [[superhero]]es, notably [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] and [[Adam Warlock]], when he tried to forcibly mutate (or "evolve") the population of the Earth in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline ''[[The Evolutionary War]]''.

He also gave the Soul Gem, one of the [[Infinity Gems]], to [[Adam Warlock]].

Eventually he relented in this effort, and is now an occasional ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other superheroes, having recently confronted his mentor Sinister alongside the [[X-Men]].

One good thing he did do is restore the [[Savage Land]] after it was destroyed by the alien [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].

==High Evolutionary in other media==

The High Evolutionary appeared in the [[Spider-Man Unlimited]] animated series voiced by [[Richard Newman]]. He seems to have connections to the character, Karen O'Malley.
