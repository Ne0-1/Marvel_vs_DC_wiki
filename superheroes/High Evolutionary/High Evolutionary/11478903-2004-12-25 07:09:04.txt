The '''High Evolutionary''' is a [[fictional character]] who is published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Herbert Edgar Wyndham was a geneticist in the [[1930s]] who, with the assistance of a disguised [[Mister Sinister]], discovered the secrets of [[DNA]].  Wyndham used this knowledge to alter his own genetic structure, thus becoming the ageless High Evolutionary.  He then went on to artificially mutate (or "evolve") a number of animals into a [[humanoid]] form.  He designated these mutates "New Men".

Due to the perceived amorality of his goal to make [[humanity]] the supreme lifeform in the universe (a goal decided upon by the abduction of his created world, ''Counter-Earth'', by a race known as the Beyonders), the High Evolutionary came into conflict with a number of [[superhero]]es, notably [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] and [[Adam Warlock]], when he tried to forcibly mutate (or "evolve") the population of the Earth.

Eventually he relented in this effort, and is now an occasional ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other superheroes, having recently confronted his mentor Sinister alongside the [[X-Men]].
