The '''High Evolutionary''' ('''Herbert Edgar Wyndham''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''Thor'' vol. 1, #134 (Nov. 1966).

The High Evolutionary is one of the greatest minds in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Originally, Herbert Wyndham built a machine that was capable of accelerating the genetic evolution of living organisms. Designing a suit of protective armor, evolving himself to the peak of human potential, and now calling himself The High Evolutionary, he is set to evolve mankind itself for the purpose of creating a better and perfect world. Due to his motives and goals, Wyndham is occasionally portrayed as an [[anti-villain]]. He is distinctly similar to the title character of the novel ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Past===
Herbert Edgar Wyndham was born in [[Manchester]], England. While a student at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in the [[1930s]], he took an interest in the work of heretical biologist Nathaniel Essex (in actuality, the disguised form of the X-Men villain [[Mister Sinister]]), and began experimenting with genetic manipulation, building a machine (that he called the genetic accelerator) with which attempted to "[[evolve]]" the rats in his mother's London basement. While attending a genetics conference in Geneva, Wyndham was approached by a mysterious man (in truth, the outcast [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] geneticist [[Phaeder]]) who handed to him papers containing blueprints for cracking the genetic code. With this information to bolster his experiments, Wyndham successfully developed a serum he dubbed "Isotope A." 
[[Image:Sinistermeets12.jpg|thumb|169px|left|[[Phaeder]] hands Wyndham the papers to break the genetic code.]]

Although expelled from the university for his single-mindedness, he finally succeeded in evolving his pet [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]], Dempsey, into a humanoid life form with the intelligence of a [[chimpanzee]]. Dempsey, unfortunately, was shot by hunters, and Wyndham realized that such creatures as he would create would have no place in the human world. In partnership with scientist Jonathan Drew (father of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]]), Wyndham moved his experiments to the seclusion of [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] in the small Balkan nation of [[Transia]]. Discovery of [[uranium]] on the land (inherited by Drew's wife) provided vast funding, and they bought more land from local baron Gregor Russoff. 

Assembling a "citadel of science" designed by German scientist Horace Grayson (father of the future [[Marvel Boy]]) and built by [[Mole Man|Moloid]] slaves supplied by Phaeder, the pair continued their experiment until Drew's daughter fell ill from uranium poisoning, and was placed into suspended animation to save her life. Subsequently, Drew's wife was attacked and killed by a [[Werewolf by Night|werewolf]] (Russoff himself, victim of a family curse), and Drew left Wundagore; Wyndham, on the other hand, developed a suit of protective silver armor for himself and continued his work. Now joined in his work by research assistant Miles Warren (future supervillain the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]), Wyndham was able to make more and more radical breakthroughs, including the [[biological uplift|genetic acceleration]] of some local animals into the half-human, half-animal beings that he dubbed his "[[New Men (Marvel comics)|New Men]]".

When Jonathan Drew returned to Wundagore, possessed by the [[ghost]] of the [[6th Century]] [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] [[Magnus]], he warned that the citadel had been constructed upon the place where the malevolent [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon]] had been banished.  He began to train the New Men in the ways of combat and chivalry of his time, until they eventually came to refer to themselves as the "Knights of Wundagore," and to Wyndham as the "Lord High Evolutionary". In 1958, Magnus's fears came to pass when Baron Russoff attempted to use the ancient magical tome known as the [[Darkhold]] to cure himself of his [[lycanthropy]], inadvertently freeing Chthon from imprisonment. The Knights held him off and Magnus was able to re-bind the demon; however, on this same night, a pregnant woman named Magda sought refuge at the citadel and gave birth to twin children there. Although she fled after childbirth, the moment of Chthon's defeat coincided with the birth of the children, and the baby girl was touched with the demon's magic. Wyndham attempted to find foster parents for the children, but when met with failure, they were placed in stasis for decades until suitable candidates were found.  Raised by Gypsies Django and Marya Maximoff, the twins grew up to be the superheroes [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]], the latter wielding chaos magic as a result of Chthon's influence.

===Counter-Earth===
[[Image:Counter-Earth25.jpg‎|249px|thumb|right|The High Evolutionary observing from his base within [[Counter-Earth]]'s moon.]]
Wyndham eventually saw the world as a far too confining place, so he converted his scientific research citadel into a spaceship, exploring the stars with his New Men.  He later settled his New Men on a planet, ''Wundagore II'', while he stayed on one of the planet's moons and began work on a [[Counter-Earth (comics)|detailed replica of Earth to be located on the opposite side of the Sun]]. Although Counter-Earth was supposed to be a temporary structure that would be evolved into a paradise, the [[Man-Beast]] (one of the New Men) corrupted the process, and Counter-Earth became an imperfect world.  By this time the High Evolutionary had adopted [[Adam Warlock]] and bestowed him with the [[Soul Gem]], dispatching him to redeem Counter-Earth.  

Eventually, one of [[Galactus]]'s [[Herald of Galactus|Heralds]] discovered this Counter-Earth.  The Evolutionary faced Galactus in battle and lost,  but the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Gorr (comics)|Gorr]] tricked the World Devourer to seek sustenance from an uninhabited world leading to a fatal condition.  Out of compassion, the Evolutionary saved Galactus by evolving him into living energy that was eventually re-collected by Galactus's world ship. 

During its construction, the High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth was targeted for collection by the Beyonders (not to be confused with [[Beyonder|The Beyonder]]).  Agents of the Beyonders manipulated Adam Warlock into murdering the High Evolutionary to allow theft of Counter-Earth, but he was revived by [[Moondragon]] and Warlock's counterpart, "Her."  The Evolutionary pursued the Beyonders to rescue his world, but he himself reported that his mind snapped when he saw their vast museum-ship, and how effectively insignificant he was compared to these alien beings. Considering the Beyonders' aggressive pursuit of Counter-Earth from its earliest stages, and the subsequent destruction of the planet while under their care, some may speculate that the Evolutionary's sanity was subtly undermined by these cosmic beings in order to prevent him from performing future experiments.

===The Evolutionary War===
{{main|The Evolutionary War}}

The High Evolutionary had become increasingly unstable and maniacal. Attempting to end his own life was prevented by his own suit. He returned to Earth, in hope to find something strong enough to overcome his armor and end his miserable life.  He goaded [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]] into attacking him, and Hulk succeeded in smashing his armor; the malfunctioning armor then devolved the High Evolutionary into a mass of [[protozoa|one-celled organisms]]. However, it was only a matter of time before the suit's circuits reorganized itself and restored the High Evolutionary to his previous state. His death and subsequent re-birth gave the High Evolutionary a new insight into the future of mankind.  Rather than being a benevolent yet distant protector, as he had been with his New Men, he would take a direct hand in molding the future of humanity, so that they might one day be as powerful as the Beyonders he had witnessed.  

The High Evolutionary later came into conflict with a number of [[superhero]]es, notably [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] and [[Adam Warlock]] when he tried to forcibly [[mutate]] (or "evolve") the population of the Earth with his "Evolution Bomb" (in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline ''[[The Evolutionary War]]''). The Avengers stopped him, though [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] was exposed to the High Evolutionary's ''Genesis Chamber'' and became "more than a god," evolving out of existence.

The High Evolutinary's evolved essence was harvested by the Celestials and imprisoned and manipulated for unknown purposes in the Black Galaxy.  After his liberation, the Evolutionary decided that rather than advancing humanity, he would create all-new gods and immortals using the unique matter that composed the Black Galaxy, including the [[Analyzer (comics)|Analyzer]]<ref>''Thor'' #419</ref>.  He and his creations were on-hand to witness the birth of a new [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]], but viewing this event with all his hyper-evolved senses seemed to drive the High Evolutionary  back to madness. This mental instability progressed to the point that the Evolutionary became infatuated with [[Shanna]], wife of [[Ka-Zar]].  Infused with the power of the Savage Land's terraformer (commissioned by the Beyonders), she had become much like the Evolutionary herself: powerful, well-meaning, and mentally unstable.  The two quickly became obsessed with each other, and  nearly departed Earth to create a new world of their own, but Ka-Zar convinced Shanna otherwise.  The Evolutionary repented, agreeing to return Shanna to her normal state once he realized (despite his mania) that the relationship should not be pursued.

=== Current whereabouts ===
In the ''Quicksilver'' series, it was revealed that the High Evolutionary's genetic code had become unstable, accounting for his periods of mania and aggression.  The Evolutionary became more powerful and maniacal than ever, but Quicksilver was still able to reason with him.  With the support of New Men Delphis and Bova, and after nearly losing his life at the hands of the Man-Beast, the Evolutionary was able to restore himself to an un-evolved human state and mental stability using Isotope G.

The High Evolutionary is now an occasional ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other superheroes.  He recently confronted his mentor Sinister alongside the [[X-Men]] when Sinister took over his satellite-based device (which temporarily stripped all [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|Mutants]] of the x-gene that grants them their powers) and altered it to mutate large sections of the populace.

He was seen in the ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]'' one-shot as one of the nine villains [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] offers to sell his soul to in order to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. In the second chapter of the Endangered Species storyline, Beast attempts to reach Wundagore Mountain to locate the Evolutionary.  The Knights of Wundagore confront and ultimately escort Beast inside, where the Evolutionary appears to him as a hologram, giving Beast only cryptic and mostly dismissive answers.

[[Spider-Man]] spoke to him during [[One More Day (comics)|One More Day]] on whether he could do anything to save the life of [[Aunt May]]. He could give no useful help.

During the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' event, the High Evolutionary appeared in Kree space, inside a vessel existing right next to a sun.  Adam Warlock brought Quasar and Moondragon to him after being overwhelmed by Phalanx warriors.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:HevsGalactus.png‎|250px|thumb|right|The High Evolutionary battling [[Galactus]] on the cover of ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #175. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
The High Evolutionary is a master [[geneticist]], and is highly skilled in a number of other scientific fields. Due to experimentation on his own [[genetic code]] and his [[cybernetic]] [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]], he has demonstrated [[god]]-like [[List of comic book superhero powers|powers]] (which have fluctuated over the years). His exoskeleton provides him with an uncanny degree of protection from attacks. It also provides [[life support]] (filtering/recycling his air and providing sustenance when needed), and contains a complete record of his genetic code. If he is badly damaged, the suit can [[Healing factor|heal his wounds]], including, in one instance, restoring him to life after [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]] had beaten him into goo. 

It is unclear which of the High Evolutionary's abilities are derived from his exoskeleton and which are [[Psionic|mental powers]] gained via self-mutation. He has displayed: ability to evolve and devolve life-forms; manipulate matter and energy; creation of life and matter from nothing; projection of powerful energy blasts; cosmic awareness; telepathy; telekinesis; extra-dimensional travel; and size altertation.

===Personality===
The Evolutionary's character has varied between that of a weary, well-meaning creator to that of a '[[mad scientist]]' who is willing to do whatever he considers necessary to further his goals of evolving a better, less-brutal world. Although menacing during his maniacal phase, the Evolutionary's history also contains more than one example of his desire to be responsible, creative, and kind.  Most Marvel writers have resisted portraying him as a standard-fare villain, thereby adding levels of sympathy and complexity to the character.  The High Evolutionary has been manipulated by both the [[Beyonders]] and the [[Celestials]], cosmic races that have interfered with human evolution in the past, indicating that his work might perhaps be a threat to their own.  Even at his most unstable, the Evolutionary has always demonstrated a paternal love toward even his most flawed creations. At one point, he offered to (and did) restore the [[Savage Land]] after it was destroyed by [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].

The Evolutionary has tried to teach his New Men the virtues of heroism, and played a key role in saving the Earth from Chthon. He also saved the life of Galactus despite his attempts to consume Counter-Earth. The High Evolutionary has also served as a benevolent father figure to several Marvel characters, including [[Adam Warlock]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Spider-Woman]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].  He is conspicuously compassionate, often forgiving (and attempting to heal) creations of his that have attempted to murder him. Though made personally wealthy by uranium deposits, the Evolutionary has also provided for a generous financial trust for the people of [[Transia]], ensuring economic stability for the nation. On several occasions he has gone to considerable lengths to protect young children, including the critically ill [[Jessica Drew]], Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, and Pietro's daughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]].

*In the [[X-Men (animated series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], the High Evolutionary is the Master of Wundagore. He seeks to create a superior generation of his New Men by using [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[DNA]], mutating humans into beast-like beings, instead of experimenting on animals. He sets up a trap to capture [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and the [[Scarlet Witch]], revealing to the twins that they are Magneto's children. He also appeared in a [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]], in which he fights [[Garokk]] and traps his essence in the ground of the [[Savage Land]].

*In the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series, The High Evolutionary had created Beastials, half-humans, half-animals on a planet called Counter-Earth with The Knights of Wundagore, who were Sir Ram, Lord Tiger, Lady Ursula and Lady Vermin.  In the second to the last episode of the series, it was revealed to the High Evolutionary that he is the grandfather of the character Karen O'Malley.  The Evolutionary was defeated at the series finale in a fight against Spider-Man and The Rebellion against him. He was voiced by [[Richard Newman]].
