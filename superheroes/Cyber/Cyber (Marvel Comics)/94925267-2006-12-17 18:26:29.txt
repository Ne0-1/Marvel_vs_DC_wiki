'''Cyber''' (possibly born '''Silas Burr''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Universe|Marvel]] [[supervillain]] and enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] of the [[X-Men]].  He was created by [[Peter David]] and [[Sam Kieth]] and first seen in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #85, September [[1991]] (though covered by a trenchcoat).  He was first fully seen and named in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #86, September [[1991]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Little is revealed about Cyber's early years. He claims that Wolverine killed his father.

Cyber was Wolverine's commanding officer during his days in the Canadian armed forces during [[World War I]].  His history prior to this is unknown.  He has used the name "Silas Burr," but this may be an alias. When Cyber murdered a woman he and Logan fought, Cyber emerged as the victor, thus humiliating Logan. Cyber's activities during the years between WWI and the modern era are unknown. In this period, his skin was fused with [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] through unknown means.  In the modern era, Cyber resurfaced in [[Madripoor]], where he interfered in the crime cartel of Wolverine's ally [[Jessan Hoan|Tiger Tyger]]. This implies that Cyber's mutation retards his aging process. Wolverine overcame his fear of Cyber in order to save Tyger's life, slashing his face and costing him an eye, and dumping him into a truck full of powerful hallucinogens he had earlier used on Wolverine, leading Cyber to run screaming into the forest.

Cyber later battled [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] alongside the female criminal organization called the "Hell's Belles." Cyber badly beat X-Factor's [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and would have killed [[Strong Guy]] if he had not been hit by a passenger train. When word reached him that the adamantium had been removed from Wolverine's skeleton Cyber sought out Wolverine in order to murder him.  In the course of the battle, Cyber broke Wolverine's bone claws. However, he was outsmarted and eventually captured by Wolverine and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] before being turned over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  

Cyber was broken out of prison by the Dark Riders, who tricked him into a chamber containing "mutant deathwatch beetles," which devoured the flesh from Cyber's entire body, beginning with his exposed face and eating the rest from the inside out. Cyber's adamantium skin, which remained untouched, was then used in an unsuccessful attempt to re-implant adamantium into Wolverine's skeleton by [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] (leader of the Dark Riders).

==Powers and abilities==

Cyber was a mutant that possessed a number of superhuman abilities, some due to his natural mutation and some due to artificial enhancement. Cyber possessed some degree of superhuman strength, though no official limit was revealed. However, Cyber's strength was considerably greater than even the finest human athlete. He was also able to destroy a car with a single arm.

Through an unrevealed surgical procedure, Cyber's skin was infused with the virtually indestructible alloy adamantium, with the exception of his face and regions of his head. As a result, most of Cyber's body was rendered invulnerable to physical injury.  Cyber's adamantium skin had proven able to withstand all attacks against it, even by weapons composed of adamantium itself.  Housed within each of Cyber's fingers was a single, retractable, adamantium claw.   Each claw was tipped in powerful hallucinogens or toxins that were capable of affecting Wolverine, before his mutant healing powers filtered them out.  The potent toxins were specifically designed to affect Wolverine and were fatal to ordinary humans within seconds.  Cyber's adamantium claws were also capable of cutting any known solid material, other than adamantium itself.

Cyber possessed an enhanced healing factor similar to that of Wolverine that enabled him to survive the process that grafted adamantium to his skin. However, Cyber's healing powers, while similar to Wolverine's, weren't nearly as efficient. Wolverine once gouged out Cyber's left eye in combat and Cyber proved unable to regenerate his missing eye and it was replaced with an artifial implant, where as Wolverine has regenerated missing eyes on multiple occasions. A side effect of this accelerated healing was a dramatically altered aging process.  Cyber was Wolverine's commanding officer during World War I and  appeared to have aged little, if any at all, since that time.  Despite his chronological age, which would have been well over 100 at the time of his death, Cyber possessed the appearance and vitality of a man in his physical prime.

Another effect of Cyber's "healing factor" was an augmentation to his musculature resulting in the production of considerably less lactic acids than ordinary humans.  As a result, Cyber possessed superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities.  Cyber could, potentially, have exerted himself at peak capacity for roughly 24 hours before fatigue would begin to set in.

Cyber's final ability was an unusual psionic ability that allowed him to track brain patterns across great distances.  The exact limit of Cyber's range was never revealed.  However, Cyber was able to use this power to track Wolverine across Edinburgh, Scotland and from Edinburgh to Muir Island.

===Skills===
Cyber was an excellent hand to hand combatant having received training as a soldier and, possibly, from various criminal organizations throughout the world.  Cyber was also well known throughout the criminal underworld and often hired himself out as a special enforcer.

==Trivia==

* Cyber, while serving as Wolverine's superior officer during World War I, brutally murders a woman named Janet, who Wolverine is romantically involved with. After Wolverine discovers the murder, he confronts Cyber who gouges out one of Wolverine's eyes. This is the most serious injury Wolverine had ever suffered up until that time, which results in Wolverine first wearing a patch over his injured eye. Wolverine's healing powers scab over the traumatic experience, repressing the memory for decades. During those decades, despite not seeing Cyber since the incident, Wolverine retains a deep psychological fear of Cyber, unaware of the reasons why until regaining the memory. Of all of the enemies Wolverine has made over the course of his life, Cyber is the only one that Wolverine has openly stated that he was ever afraid of. The incident causes Wolverine to renounce all religions, particularly [[Christianity]], which Wolverine had discovered through his relationship with Janet<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #85</ref><ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #134</ref><ref>''Alpha Flight'' (first series) #33</ref>
