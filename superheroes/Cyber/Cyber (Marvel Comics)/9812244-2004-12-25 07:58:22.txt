'''Cyber''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]] and enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] of the [[X-Men]].  He was created by [[Peter David]] and [[Sam Keith]] in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #88 (Late September [[1991]]).

==History==

The man who would be called Cyber was the commanding officer of Wolverine during his days in the Canadian armed forces in [[World War I]].  His history prior to this is unknown; he has used the name "Slias Burr", but this may be an alias or simply a pun.  The two men fought when Cyber killed a woman, and Logan was decisively beaten and humiliated.  As a result of this, Cyber would, for years, be the only man who Wolverine would admit to being afraid of.  Cyber's activities during the years between WWI and the modern era are unknown; however, given that he survived to the modern era in peak physical condition, it is likely that he is a mutant or has been mutated in some way.  In this period, his skin was covered with [[adamantium]] through unknown means.  In the modern era, Cyber resurfaced in [[Madripoor]], where he interfered in the crime carrtel of Wolverine's ally [[Tiger Tyger]].  Wolverine was forced to overcome his fear of Cyber in order to save Tyger's life, and in the process he cut out one of Cyber's eyes.

Cyber later battled the team of government operatives called [[X-Factor]] alongside the female criminal organization called the "Hell's Belles".  There, Cyber badly beat X-Factor's [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and was on the verge of killing her teammate [[Strong Guy]] when he was hit by a passenger train, taking him out of the fight.  Shortly after the adamantium had been removed from Wolverine's skeleton at the hands of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Cyber encountered and fought Wolverine again.  In the course of the battle, Cyber snapped off the claws on Wolverine's right hand, which were now made of bone rather than metal.  Cyber was eventually defeated and captured by Wolverine and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] before being turned over to [[SHIELD|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  Cyber was eventually broken out of prison by the [[Dark Riders]], a team of mutants serving [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s villainous son [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] and devoted to the return of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].  The Dark Riders tricked him into a chamber containing "mutant deathwatch beetles", which apparently devoured the flesh from Cyber's entire body, beginning with his exposed face and eating the rest from the inside out. Cyber's adamantium skin, which had remained untouched, was then used in an unsuccessful attempt by Genesis to re-implant adamantium into Wolverine's skeleton.

==Superhuman abilities==

Cyber's skin has been covered or replaced with a layer of indestructible [[adamantium]] through unknown means.  The only part of his body that is known to be exposed is his face, although he wears a mask that covers all of his head save for his mouth and chin.  In order to survive the implanting of the adamantium, Cyber would need to have possessed endurance levels comparable with those of Wolverine.  Cyber also possesses retractable adamantium talons, which he has been known to coat with drugs or toxins.  Cyber is extremely strong, and if he does possess superhuman levels of endurance he likely possesses comparable levels of superhuman strength.
