'''[[Tarzan]]''', a [[fictional character]] created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], first appeared in the [[1912 in literature|1912]] [[novel]] ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'',<ref name=toonop-tarz>{{cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/tarzan.htm|title= Tarzan of the Apes|first= Don|last= Markstein|date= |publisher= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|deadurl= |accessdate= October 7, 2012}}</ref> and then in 23 sequels. The character proved immensely popular and quickly made the jump to other media, including [[comics]].

==Comic strips==
''Tarzan of the Apes'' was adapted into newspaper strip form, first published January 7, 1929 with illustrations by [[Hal Foster]].<ref name=toonop-tarz/> A [[Comic strip formats|full page]] [[Sunday strip]] began on March 15, 1931 with artwork by Rex Maxon.<ref name=toonop-tarz/> [[United Media|United Feature Syndicate]] distributed the strip.

Over the years, many artists have drawn the ''Tarzan'' [[comic strip]], notably [[Burne Hogarth]], [[Ruben Moreira]], [[Russ Manning]], [[John Celardo]] and [[Mike Grell]]. The [[daily strip]] began to reprint old dailies after the last Russ Manning daily (#10,308, which ran on 29 July 1972). The Sunday strip also turned to reprints circa 2000. Both strips continue as reprints today in a few newspapers and in ''[[Comics Revue]]'' magazine. [[NBM Publishing]] did a quality reprint series of the Foster and Hogarth work on Tarzan in a series of hardback and paperback reprints in the 1990s.

The comic strip has often borrowed plots and characters from the Burroughs books. Writer Don Kraar, who wrote the strip from 1982 to 1995, included in his scripts [[David Innes]] and [[John Carter of Mars]].

==Comic books==
===United States===
[[Image:Hulwed.jpg|right|thumb|270px|[[Burne Hogarth]]'s ''Tarzan'' (June 25, 1939)]]
Tarzan has appeared in many comic books from numerous publishers over the years, notably [[Western Publishing]], [[Charlton Comics]], [[DC Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]]. The character's earliest comic book appearances were in comic strip reprints published in several titles, such as ''Sparkler'', ''Tip Top Comics'' and ''Single Series''.

====Western Publishing====
Western Publishing published ''Tarzan'' in [[Dell Comics]]' ''[[Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #134 & 161 in 1947, before giving him his own series, ''Tarzan'' #1-131 (January-February 1948 - July-August 1962), through [[Dell Comics]]<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/543/ ''Tarzan'' (Dell Comics)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> as well as in some ''Dell Giants'' and ''[[March of Comics]]'' giveaways, then continued the series with #132-206 (November 1962 to February 1972) through their own [[Gold Key Comics]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1537/ ''Tarzan'' (Gold Key Comics)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>  This series featured artwork by [[Jesse Marsh]], [[Russ Manning]], and [[Doug Wildey]]. It included adaptions of most of Edgar Rice Burroughs's original Tarzan books (skipping only ''Tarzan and the Leopard Men'', ''Tarzan the Magnificent'', ''Tarzan and the Madman'' and ''Tarzan and the Castaways''), as well as original stories and other features. Almost all of the Dell and Gold Key ''Tarzan'' stories were written by [[Gaylord DuBois]].  Western also published a companion series, ''Korak: Son of Tarzan'' for 45 issues from 1964-72.

====DC Comics====
DC Comics took over the series in 1972, publishing ''Tarzan'' #207-258 from April 1972 to February 1977.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2035/ ''Tarzan'' (DC Comics)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> This version initially showcased artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s depiction of the character.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 151|quote = Tarzan enjoyed a prolific period in comics when DC acquired the rights to novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs' iconic ape-man. Much of that success should be attributed to writer, artist, and editor Joe Kubert, a lifelong Tarzan fan whose gritty, expressive style was perfect for the jungle hero.}}</ref> It featured some adaptations of the Burroughs books in addition to original stories, adapting ''Tarzan of the Apes'', ''The Return of Tarzan'', ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'', ''Tarzan the Untamed'', ''Tarzan and the Lion Man'' and ''Tarzan and the Castaways''. Initially the series featured adaptions of other Burroughs creations, and had the companion titles ''[[Korak (character)|Korak, Son of Tarzan]]''<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2029/ ''Korak, Son of Tarzan'' (DC Comics)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> and ''[[Weird Worlds (comics)|Weird Worlds]]''. The ''Korak'' series was later renamed ''The Tarzan Family'',<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2229/ ''The Tarzan Family''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> into which all the non-Tarzan Burroughs adaptations were consolidated. During this period, the British arm of [[Warner Bros.]], the corporate parent of DC Comics, published ''Tarzan'' and ''Korak'' for the British market. Two issues of ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition (comics)|Limited Collectors' Edition]]'' featured reprints of Kubert's ''Tarzan'' stories.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/245179/ ''Limited Collectors' Edition'' #C-22] at the Grand Comics Database</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/68946/ ''Limited Collectors' Edition'' #C-29] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

====Marvel Comics====
In 1977 the series moved to Marvel Comics, retitled as ''Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle''. Marvel published 29 issues and 3 Annuals from June 1977 to October 1979.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2408/ ''Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> It restarted the numbering rather than assuming that used by the previous publishers. The series featuring artwork by [[John Buscema]]. Burroughs books adapted by Marvel include ''Tarzan of the Apes'', ''Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar'' and ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan''. Marvel did not continue the ''Tarzan Family'' title, publishing instead a series on Burroughs' primary non-Tarzan character, ''[[John Carter, Warlord of Mars]]''.  ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #29 (1983) featured a Tarzan story by writers [[Sharman DiVono]] and [[Mark Evanier]] and artist [[Dan Spiegle]].

====Dark Horse Comics====
Dark Horse Comics has published various ''Tarzan'' series from 1996 to the present, including archive reprints of works from previous publishers such as Western/Gold Key and DC. Dark Horse and DC published two [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] titles teaming Tarzan with [[Batman]] and [[Superman]]. ''Batman/Tarzan: Claws of the Cat-Woman'' is a "straight" team-up between Tarzan and the 1930s Batman to save an ancient city- during which the two form an effective team as they acknowledge their similar origins, despite such differences as Tarzan's willingness to use lethal force.<ref>{{cite book|last = Marz|first = Ron|authorlink = Ron Marz|coauthors = [[Igor Kordey|Kordey, Igor]]|title = Batman/Tarzan: Claws of the Cat-Woman|publisher = [[Dark Horse Comics]]|date = 2000|pages = 96|isbn = 1569714665}}</ref> ''Superman/Tarzan: Sons of the Jungle'' is a revisionist version in which Lord Greystoke grows up in England, while Kal-El is raised by the apes as "Argozan", although the two switch roles at the conclusion with Greystoke remaining in the jungle while Kal-El returns to the city, Greystoke stating in a letter to his parents that he feels as though he has found his true place.<ref>{{cite book|last = Dixon|first = Chuck|authorlink = Chuck Dixon|coauthors = [[Carlos Meglia|Meglia, Carlos]]|title = Superman/Tarzan: Sons of the Jungle|publisher = Dark Horse Comics|date = 2002|pages = 80|isbn = 1569717613}}</ref> Tarzan also fought the [[Predator (alien)|Predators]] in the ''Tarzan vs. Predator: At the Earth's Core'' miniseries.<ref>{{cite book|last = Simonson|first = Walt|authorlink = Walt Simonson|coauthors = [[Lee Weeks|Weeks, Lee]]|title = Tarzan vs. Predator: At the Earth's Core|publisher = Dark Horse Comics|date = 1997|pages = 104|isbn = 156971231X}}</ref>

====Other publishers====
[[File:Johncelardo2.jpg|right|thumb|230px|[[John Celardo]] drew the ''Tarzan'' comic strip from 1954 to 1968.]]
During the timespan of the original comic book series from Western, DC and Marvel, a number of other comic book projects from other publishers also appeared.

[[Charlton Comics]] briefly published a Tarzan comic in the 1960s titled ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'', adapting stories from that Burroughs book, on the mistaken belief that the character was in the [[public domain]].

Watson-Guptill Publications published hardcover comic book versions of the first half of ''Tarzan of The Apes'' in 1972 and four stories from ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan'' in 1976. These were illustrated by Hogarth many years after he stopped doing the newspaper strip and had a level of penmanship rarely seen in comics or even illustrations. It had captions of text from the novel instead of speech balloons. 

Between the periods when Marvel and Dark Horse held the licence to the character, Tarzan had no regular comic book publisher for a number of years. During this time [[Blackthorne Publishing]] published ''Tarzan'' in 1986, and [[Malibu Comics]] published ''Tarzan'' in 1992.

There have in addition been a number of minor appearance of Tarzan in comic books over the years. Though not mentioned by name, Tarzan is referenced in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Places and people from the original Tarzan novels are referred to, suggesting that Tarzan does or did exist in that [[World of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|universe]].

In a 1999 ''[[The Phantom]]'' story, the hero meets Edgar Rice Burroughs, and inspires him to create Tarzan. Warren Ellis' ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' series has a [[pastiche]] of Tarzan named [[Lord Blackstock]].

===Europe===
''Tarzan'' comics were the first publications by the German [[Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Schriften]] after its founding in 1954.

The European version of the ''Tarzan'' comic was published from 1983 to 1989 by Marketprint in [[Yugoslavia]], and later translated and published in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]. There were over 100 published episodes, each of which had 16 pages. In most of them [[Branislav Kerac]] was involved, either as the writer, penciller, inker, or complete author.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kerac_bane.htm|title= Bane Kerac|date= November 13, 2006|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6BEKDbHdG
|archivedate= October 7, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= October 7, 2012}}</ref> He was also responsible for "The Kalonga Star," a five episode crossover between Tarzan and [[Kobra (comic book)|Kobra]]. Other notable episodes were "Tarzan and Barbarians," "The Tiger," "The Boy from the Stars," and "Big Race."
