'''Benjamin "Uncle Ben" Parker''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is an important figure in the history of the [[Spider-Man]] titles, and often appears in [[flashback]]s. He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15, and was killed later that issue.

==Biography==
When Richard and Mary Parker were killed, Richard's older brother Ben and his wife, [[Aunt May|May]], took in their orphaned son Peter and raised him.

Ben was eventually killed by a burglar; Peter subsequently captured the burglar, and was horrified to realize that it was the same burglar who he could have captured earlier that day, except that he had chosen to not get involved. As a result, Peter considered himself morally responsible for Ben's death, and resolved to fight crime as a superhero, vowing to always take his responsibilities seriously. 

=="With great power comes great responsibility"==
The often-quoted Spider-man theme of "with great power there comes great responsibility" (typically misquoted as "with great power comes great responsibility") is widely attributed to Uncle Ben. However, this was not initially true. In ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15, the phrase appears in a narrative caption in the comic's last [[panel]], not as spoken dialogue. In fact, Ben has only two lines in the entire comic.

However, later stories and flashbacks that took place when Ben was still alive retroactively made the phrase one of Ben's many homilies he would lecture Peter with. Recent reinterpretations of Spider-Man, such as the [[Spider-Man (movie)|''Spider-Man'' movie]] and the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comic, depict Ben as using this phrase while he is still alive.

==Notability==
Uncle Ben was notable as one of the few [[comic book deaths]] that stuck. He is a member of the "Big Three", referring also to [[Jason Todd]] and [[Bucky]], other characters whose revivals would negate major character motivation and development. In fact, if one includes the [[Ultimate Marvel]] rebooted continuity, Uncle Ben is the only one to have stayed dead across all major continuities. However, with both Jason Todd and Bucky returning recently, this leaves Uncle Ben as the only one.

==Portrayal in media==
In the [[Spider-Man (movie)|successful film adaptation]] released in [[2002]], Uncle Ben was played by [[Cliff Robertson]]. In [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]], he was voiced by the late [[Brian Keith]].

==Franklin Richards's Uncle Ben==

[[Franklin Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] often refers to Benjamin Grimm, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], as "Uncle Ben". Interestingly, Franklin Richards's middle name is Benjamin&mdash;the same as the middle name of Peter Benjamin Parker, Spider-Man. This is not entirely coincidental; Ben Parker and the Thing are, respectively, the [[namesake]]s of Peter Parker and Franklin Richards.

==Spider-Girl's Uncle Ben==

Like her father, Mayday also has an Uncle Ben. However, unlike her dad, May never knew her Uncle Ben. May's Uncle Ben, is [[Ben Reilly]], the Spider-Man clone. However, when Mayday asked her dad about him, Peter left out the fact that Ben was really Peter's clone. 

Also, if [[Spider-Girl]] had any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben - May's baby brother, and Peter & MJ's second child. However, it is unknown after who the young Ben was named after - As Peter & MJ named May after Peter's Aunt May, Mayday asked which Uncle Ben the new born was named after, her Uncle Ben, or his (Peter's) Uncle Ben. Peter then asked if it really mattered, which May responded to with "I guess not".
