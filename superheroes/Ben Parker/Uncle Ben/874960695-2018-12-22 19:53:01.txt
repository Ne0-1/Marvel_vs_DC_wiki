'''Benjamin''' "'''Ben'''" '''Parker''', usually called '''Uncle Ben''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. He is the husband of [[Aunt May|May Parker]] and paternal uncle of Peter Parker, AKA Spider-Man. Uncle Ben first appeared in ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (August 1962) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]]. Modeled after American founding father [[Benjamin Franklin]], the character plays an influential role in the Spider-Man comic books.

==Publication history==
Uncle Ben first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962) and was killed in the very same issue. Although his history as a supporting character was very brief, Uncle Ben is an overshadowing figure in Spider-Man's life, often appearing in [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]].

===Notability of death===
The murder of Uncle Ben is notable as one of the few [[comic book death]]s, that has never been reversed in terms of [[Continuity (fiction)|official continuity]]. He was a member of the "Big Three", referring also to [[Jason Todd]] (an associate of [[Batman]]) and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] (an associate of [[Captain America]]) whose notable deaths, along with Ben's, gave rise to the phrase: "No one in comics stays dead except for Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben". Later, the revivals of both Bucky and Jason in 2005 led to the amendment, "No one in comics stays dead except Uncle Ben". The violent killing of Uncle Ben, done by [[Burglar (comics)|a common street criminal]], also shares multiple similarities to the death of [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]], the parents of Batman, which sometimes is included in the saying.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Tallon |last=Sanford |first=Jonathan J. |last2=Irwin |first2=William |title=Spider-Man and Philosophy: The Web of Inquiry |date=15 May 2012 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |page=86 |isbn=9780470575604 |chapter-url=https://books.google.es/books?id=oEHbCwcV-NEC&pg=PA86 |chapter=With Great Power Comes Great Culpability}}</ref>

There have been examples of Uncle Ben remaining alive in [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternative timelines]], including stories featured in Marvel's ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' (one of which he forces Peter to unmask in front of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]), and a storyline of the 1994 ''Spider-Man'' animated series featured a universe where Uncle Ben had never died, and Peter Parker became a successful industrialist, having never really bothered to use his powers responsibly as everything always seemed to work out for him. This fact is used to defeat the rampaging [[Carnage (comics)|Spider-Carnage]] by exposing him to the one person he will trust and listen to: the Uncle Ben of that reality.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

A story-line in the official series ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' seemingly suggested that Ben may be alive. This Ben, however, was actually from a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] where [[Aunt May]] died in a random accident, leaving him to raise Peter. This alternate Ben came to the planet Earth of regular ''Marvel'' comics (the [[Earth-616|616 reality]]) as part of an evil plan devised by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211|Hobgoblin of 2211]] to defeat the Spider-Men of different eras.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

During the ''[[Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, when Peter's clone [[Ben Reilly]] who named himself after Uncle Ben and Aunt May, taking Ben's first name and May's last to differentiate himself from Peter used the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]]'s technology to revive various old enemies and allies of Peter Parker, he offered to bring Uncle Ben back to life while trying to win Peter to his point of view,<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Jim Cheung]] |title=The Clone Conspiracy |issue=3 |date=7 December 2016 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=61715 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61715/the_clone_conspiracy_2016_3}}</ref> but although tempted at the offer, Peter concluded that the reason Ben had not brought 'their' uncle back on his own was that he knew that Uncle Ben would disapprove of his "nephew's actions", as Ben's plan would see everyone on Earth granted immortality while dependent on him to supply the medication needed to stabilize their cloned bodies.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Jim Cheung]] |title=The Clone Conspiracy |issue=4 |date=18 January 2017 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=61716 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61716/the_clone_conspiracy_2016_4}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Ben Parker was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He trained to be a [[military police]] officer,<ref>{{Cite comic |title=Amazing Spider-Man |issue=519 |date=20 April 2005 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=1868 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1868/amazing_spider-man_1999_519}}</ref> and also spent time as a singer in a band. He had known his future wife, [[Aunt May|May Reilly]] since their high school days, but she in turn was naively interested in a boy who was involved in criminal activities. When he came to her one night and proposed to her on the spot, Ben was there to expose him as a murderer, and to comfort the heart-broken May when the boy was arrested. Their relationship evolved into love, and they enjoyed a happily married life. When Ben's younger brother [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker and his wife Mary]] were killed in a plane crash, Ben and May took in their orphaned son Peter and raised him as their own.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Bob Gale]], [[Mark Waid]], [[Zeb Wells]], [[Marc Guggenheim]] |penciller=[[Colleen Doran]], Mitch Breitweiser, [[Mario Alberti]], [[Marcos Martin]] |copencillers=[[John Romita, Jr.]] |inker=[[Andy Lanning]], [[Klaus Janson]] |story=Chris Eliopolous, Joe Caramagna |title=Amazing Spider-Man |issue=600 |date=2 July 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=24407 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/24407/amazing_spider-man_1999_600}}</ref>

Ben was very protective of Peter, going as far as fighting some of the bullies that tormented young Parker. Peter became friends with [[Charlie Weiderman]] in high school, a teen even more unpopular than he was. However, Charlie often provoked the trouble with the other teens. One day, he was chased to the Parker home by a group of bullies led by Rich and Ben intervened. Ben told them that if they wanted Charlie, they would have to go through him. Rich tried to, but was surprised by Ben's [[US army|army]] training. As soon as the bullies were gone, he told the boy that he was not welcome at the house or with Peter because of his provoking the bullies and not being able to tell the truth.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Stan Lee]] |penciller=[[Mike Deodato]] |inker=[[Jose Pimentel]] |title=Amazing Spider-Man |issue=516 |date=2 July 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=1511 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1511/amazing_spider-man_1999_516}}</ref>

In high school, a radioactive spider bite gave Peter superhuman powers. Creating the costumed identity of Spider-Man for himself, Peter sought first to exploit his newfound powers as a masked wrestler and then as a television star. Coming from a television appearance, Spider-Man saw a [[Burglar (comics)|burglar]]<ref>{{cite comic |title=Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man |date=31 December 2029 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |issue=12 |writer=Jeff Christiansen, Eric Engelhard, Al Sjoerdsma, [[Jason Godin]] |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/1886/official_handbook_of_the_marvel_universe_2004_12_spider-man/spider-man |id=1886}}</ref> being chased by a security guard. The guard called for Spider-Man to stop the thief, but the nascent Spidey refused on the grounds that catching criminals was not his job. The robber got away.<ref name=AmazingFantasy15>{{cite comic|writer=[[Stan Lee]]|artist=[[Steve Ditko]]|title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]|story=Spider-Man!|issue=15|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=August 1962}}</ref>

When Peter later returned home, he was informed by a police officer that his beloved Uncle Ben had been killed by a burglar. Outraged, he donned his Spider-Man costume and captured the man only to realize to his horror that it was the same burglar whom he could have effortlessly captured earlier at the studio. As a result, Peter considered himself morally responsible for Ben's death and resolved to fight crime as a superhero &mdash; realizing that with great power comes great responsibility &mdash; and vowing never to let another innocent person come to harm if he could help it. This quote however originated from Albert Einstein.<ref name=AmazingFantasy15/>

Ben Parker's death was truly avenged when the burglar returned for the money once more, threatening Aunt May. The burglar died from a heart attack upon beholding his old nemesis Spider-Man once again and learning that Spider-Man and Peter Parker were one and the same person.Â´<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Stan Lee]] |penciller=[[Keith Pollard]], [[Jim Mooney]] |inker=Jim Mooney |colorist=Glynis Oliver |title=Amazing Spider-Man |issue=200 |date=10 January 1980 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=6595 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/6595/the_amazing_spider-man_1963_200}}</ref>

In ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #7, May relates to Peter her account of meeting Ben for the first time.

Ben briefly appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #500; after Spider-Man played a vital role in preventing the resurrection of [[Dormammu]], an unidentified higher power provided [[Doctor Strange]] with a small box that he felt he had to give to Spider-Man as a reward for his role in events. When Peter opened the box on the roof of his apartment building, it contained a note saying "You have five minutes. Spend them as you will", followed by Ben appearing on the roof. It was revealed that this Ben - whether a ghost or Ben having been temporally relocated from the moment before his death - remembered being out for the walk that resulted in him getting shot but nothing afterwards, although he concluded that the events leading to him being on that roof were not important. In their talk Ben said that the only thing that would disappoint him about Peter is if Peter ever settled for less because he was afraid of reaching for more. This helps Peter to see that he had a good life for all its hardships, recognizing that he has always used what he has, and Ben assures Peter that he is proud of him before he vanishes.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Stan Lee]] |penciller=[[John Romita, Jr.]] |inker=Scott Hanna |title=Amazing Spider-Man |issue=500 |date=10 January 1980 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=277 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/277/amazing_spider-man_1999_500}}</ref>

During the 2008â2009 "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Uncle Ben makes an appearance in the Underworld when [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] attends the trial of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], directing [[Amadeus Cho]] as he attempted to find his parents in the afterlife.<ref>{{cite comic |title=Incredible Hercules |issue=130 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=24 June 2009 |writer=[[Fred Van Lente]], [[Greg Pak]] |penciller=[[Ryan Stegman]], Rodney Buchemi |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/25429/incredible_hercules_2008_130 |id=25429}}</ref> In the "Amazing Grace" storyline, Ben appears as an apparition to Spider-Man while battling a horde of demons and gargoyles, telling him that his death is not Peter's or anyone's fault. However, one enemy notices him and attacked only to disappear.  This left Spider-Man puzzled if he was [[Daydream|imagining Ben or he was really talking to his ghost]].<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Jose Molina |penciller=[[Simone Bianchi (artist)|Simone Bianchi]], Andrea Broccardo |inker=Simone Bianchi, Andrea Broccardo |title=Amazing Spider-Man |issue=1.6 |volume=4 |date=10 January 1980 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/277/amazing_spider-man_1999_500}}</ref>

When Ben Reilly adopted the identity of the Jackal and set up an elaborate plan to use Warren's new cloning process to make the world immortal, he attempted to win Peter's allegiance by showing him Ben's coffin and offering to bring Ben back to life.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Jim Cheung]] |title=The Clone Conspiracy |issue=3 |date=7 December 2016 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=61715 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61715/the_clone_conspiracy_2016_3}}</ref> However, although tempted by the idea, Peter realized that Ben never intended to bring 'their' uncle back to life because he would have done it already, coldly informing his clone that Uncle Ben would tell him that he was wrong.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Jim Cheung]] |title=The Clone Conspiracy |issue=4 |date=18 January 2017 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |id=61716 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61716/the_clone_conspiracy_2016_4}}</ref> At the conclusion of the crisis, Peter takes a moment beside the coffin containing Ben's corpse, acknowledging that Reilly's actions were wrong but wishing that he was there regardless.<ref>{{cite comic |title=The Clone Conspiracy: Omega |issue=1 |writer=[[Peter David]], [[Christos Gage]], [[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Stuart Immonen]], [[Cory Smith]], [[Mark Bagley]] |date=1 March 2017 |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/62649/the_clone_conspiracy_omega_2017_1 |id=62649 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===What If?===
Uncle Ben was featured in various issues of ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]''.

* In one reality where May was killed by the burglar instead of Ben, Peter immediately went after the burglar, but accidentally pushed him out of the window of a warehouse during the fight, resulting in Ben taking the blame for the crime to save his nephew. Lacking the moral influence of Ben or the need to stay secret for his aunt, Peter broke out of the orphanage he was sent to and began to defeat criminals for the reward money, matters coming to a head when he nearly killed the Green Goblin in a fight. Attempting to break Ben out of prison, Ben nevertheless convinced him that he had to accept responsibility for his actions, prompting Peter to return to school and form a relationship with Mary Jane after Anna Watson took him in, culminating in Ben helping Peter in his crime-fighting activities after he was released from prison.{{issue|date=July 2012}}
* In the first "What If" story regarding Spider-Man (named "classic"), it was Aunt May who went downstairs after hearing a noise, not wanting to wake up Ben. The same storyline plays out, with the burglar shooting May and Spider-Man apprehending him in the warehouse. In this story, Ben finds out about Peter's activities as Spider-Man relatively soon, and talks to him about it. Peter explains to him when he donned the costume and why, even telling him about letting the would-be murderer go that very same night he robbed the wrestling register. Peter breaks down, saying how everything was his fault. Ben responds with anger at himself, being weak in not being able to protect "his May". After Peter tells him he did not know and could not have possibly done anything, Ben instantly calms down and tells Peter to follow his own advice. He further inspires Peter to keep being Spider-Man, not because of regret or penance, but to protect and help all those who are weak and in need of help. Ben and Peter form an even closer relationship with Ben offering his support in many of Spider-Man's future battles. Eventually Ben becomes outraged at Jameson's constant smearing of Spider-Man's name, considering it an insult to May's memory. He eventually lets Jameson in on Spider-Man's identity, forcing Jameson in a position he is uncomfortable in as a journalist. He cannot expose Spider-Man without endangering Ben Parker, yet he also does not wish to support vigilantism. Eventually, he finds a middle road and unofficially employs Spider-Man so he can gain inside scoops on crimes being solved in the city. The story eventually ends with Spider-Man saving Bennett Brant and Betty Brant from Doctor Octopus, as well as fighting a Green Goblin who kidnapped Jameson to find out Spider-Man's real identity (having correctly surmised there was a reason Jameson had those inside scoops). At the end of it all, Peter and Ben shake hands with Ben saying they will face all dangers and the future together.<ref>{{cite comic |title=What If? |issue=46 |volume=7 |writer=[[Peter B.

===Derailed Alt-Ben Parker===
In an alternate reality shown in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'', an alternate reality was witnessed where May died in a random accident, prompting Peter to go into show business with Ben as his agent to make money. Peter's focus on his career prompts him to eventually leave home, simply paying Ben a percentage out of respect for their old relationship rather than any actual concern. This Ben was eventually 'derailed' into the 616 reality by the Hobgoblin of 2211 as part of her plan against the Spider-Men of various eras, leaving him shocked when he witnessed his destroyed house and the still-living May Parker. Confronting her, he ended up in a fight with [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]], with whom she at the time has a relationship with, but wandered away in confusion. Lacking direction, Ben wandered into an alleyway where he encountered a shadowy figure who offered him a gun, telling Ben that any action he takes would simply create another universe where he took the opposite action, so he might as well do what felt good. After this Hobgoblin was erased from history by a Retcon Bomb of her own invention, the [[Spider-Man 2211|Spider-Man of 2211]] met with what he presumed to be the same Ben Parker to take him back to his own timeline. In a surprise twist, deciding he rather wanted to "stick around for a while", this Ben Parker shoots this future Spider-Man. At the same time, another Ben Parker was shown dead in the alley, meaning one Ben Parker had killed the other and taken his place.<ref>{{cite comic |title=Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man |issue=13 |writer=[[Peter David]] |penciller=[[Todd Nauck]] |inker=[[Rob Campanella]] |colorist=[[Lee Loughridge]] |letterer=Cory Petit |date=4 October 2016 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/5237/friendly_neighborhood_spider-man_2005_13 |id=5237}}</ref>

It was revealed that the Ben Parker who had died in the alleyway was the Uncle Ben of the alternate reality, while the Ben Parker who killed Spider-Man 2211 was, in fact, the Chameleon of 2211; the Chameleon had attempted to convince Ben to resort to murder, but Spider-Man correctly guessed that there were no circumstances under which Ben would do such a thing.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

=="With great power comes great responsibility"==
The thematic and often-quoted (including by the Supreme Court of the United States<ref>{{cite web|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|title=Supreme Court Quotes Spiderman's 'Great Power, Great Responsibility' Line In Rejecting Royalties On Expired Patent|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150622/10224031420/supreme-court-quotes-spidermans-great-power-great-responsibility-line-rejecting-royalties-expired-patent.shtml|website=Techdirt.|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref>) Spider-Man phrase ''with great power comes great responsibility'' is widely attributed to Uncle Ben. However, in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15, where it first appears, it is not spoken by any character. In fact, Ben has only two lines in the entire comic. The original version of the phrase appears in a narrative caption of the comic's last [[Panel (comics)|panel]], rather than as spoken dialogue. It reads, "''...with great power there must also come -- great responsibility!''".<ref>[http://www.quotecounterquote.com/2012/07/with-great-power-comes-great.html The Evolution of the Pithy Proverb: âWith great power comes great responsibility.â] at Quote/Counterquote. Accessed April 11, 2013</ref>

However, later stories and flashbacks that took place when Ben was still alive retroactively made the phrase one of Ben's many homilies he would lecture Peter with. Latter-day reinterpretations of Spider-Man, such as the [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'' film]] and the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comic, depict Ben as saying this phrase to Peter while he is still alive, in their last conversation. Both the aforementioned adaptations also had Peter lash out at Ben just after he says it, and both also mention his father.

The origins of the phrase pre-date its use in Spider-Man. Most famously quoted by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, this phrase has questionable origins. In 1817, [[member of British parliament]] [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Lamb]] is recorded saying, "the possession of great power necessarily implies great responsibility."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&output=text&as_brr=0&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1850&id=B6w9AAAAcAAJ&dq=%22great-power+*+great-responsibility%22&q=%22%22that%2Bthe%2Bpossession%2Bof%2Bgreat%2Bpower%2Bnecessarily%2Bimplies%2Bgreat%2Bresponsibility%22%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ei%3DYX5WUqnYGaiO4wT9poCwBQ%26ved%3D0CDMQ6wEwAA%23v%3Donepage%26q%3D%22that+the+possession+of+great+power+necessarily+implies+great+responsibility%22%26f%3Dfalse%22#v=onepage&q=%22%22that%2Bthe%2Bpossession%2Bof%2Bgreat%2Bpower%2Bnecessarily%2Bimplies%22&f=false Parliamentary Debates, edited by Thomas C.

===Television===
* Uncle Ben appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' television series. He appeared in the episode "The Origin of Spider-Man".
* Uncle Ben was mentioned in the 1980s ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' television series.

* Uncle Ben appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. He appeared in the episode "Along Came Spidey".
* Uncle Ben appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Brian Keith]] (in "The Menace of Mysterio", "The Mutant Agenda" and the "Spider Wars" series finale). This version was seen in flashbacks or as a spirit talking to Peter Parker whenever his nephew gets frustrated the tough choices as [[Spider-Man]]. In the series finale when Spider-Man had to stop Spider-Carnage from destroying all reality, Spider-Man managed to make contact with his uncle's alternate reality counterpart in a world where Peter Parker was a successful industrialist; realizing that Peter's counterpart in this reality had ''never'' failed or had any difficulties in life due to a casual attitude towards the crisis as opposed to Spider-Man's counterparts, Peter realized that Ben was almost certainly still alive in this reality if he was alive in any alternate timeline. Thanks to Ben's influence, Spider-Carnage was convinced to stop trying to destroy reality. After Spider-Carnage instead used the reality bomb to create a portal and subsequently committed suicide by entering the portal to end the threat once and for all, Spider-Man and Ben hugged; they lived in different realities, however, Ben was proud of his nephew while Spider-Man assured Ben that he will always have him in his own heart.
* In ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Uncle Ben is briefly mentioned in the pilot episode "Worlds Apart" [Part One]. He is also seen in the theme song which Uncle Ben was killed.
* Uncle Ben appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Edward Asner]]. His character remains faithful to the comics. He is featured in Spider-Man's flashback in the episode "Intervention" revealed that Ben was killed while defending May Parker during a break-in at their house by a [[Burglar (comics)|burglar]] that Peter Parker selfishly let go earlier that day. After Peter discovered that Ben was murdered by a burglar who broke into the Parker house and stole Ben's car, Peter furiously sought revenge, donning the Spider-Man costume and confronting the burglar in an old warehouse. Spider-Man unmasked his uncle's killer, realizing that it was the same burglar from earlier. After knocking the criminal out and lowered to policeman via web line, Peter vowed to use these spider powers for good and to never put himself before anyone else and to never to let another innocent person come to harm if anything could help it, and remembering his uncle's words: 'With great power there must also come great responsibility'.
* Uncle Ben is featured in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Greg Grunberg]] (in "Strange"),<ref>{{cite episode |title=Strange |series=Ultimate Spider-Man |network=[[Disney XD]] |season=1 |number=13 |airdate=July 8, 2012}}</ref> and by [[Clancy Brown]] (in "Return to the Spider-Verse" [Pt. 2]).<ref>{{cite episode |title=Return to the Spider-Verse Pt. 2 |series=Ultimate Spider-Man |network=[[Disney XD]] |season=4 |number=17 |airdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref> His character is loosely based on his Ultimate counterpart as opposed to his previous versions. In the pilot episodes "Great Power" and "Great Responsibility", Peter Parker recalled that fateful night of his uncle's murder and [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] uses Ben's memory to have Spider-Man join [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] instead of being solo. A picture of Ben is also seen having fun with May Parker and their young nephew. Ben is personally featured in the episode "Strange Days". [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] tries to use Spider-Man's failure being unable to save his uncle's life, however, this does not work; Ben actually motivates Peter to defeat Nightmare (something neither [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] nor [[Doctor Strange]] are able to do). In the episode "Ultimate Deadpool", Spider-Man remembers his uncle's memory when thinking about [[Deadpool]]'s own demons. The character is occasionally referenced in ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'' primarily as May's source of [[Ben Reilly]]'s name. The episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 2 features a [[American frontier|Wild West]] reality version who is depicted as the "'''[[Phantom Rider]]'''" and Webslinger the Spider Cowboy's uncle. As [[Doctor Octopus|Doc Ock Holliday]]'s brainwashed Deputy, the Phantom Rider helped repelled Wolf Spider and later fought both Spider-Man and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Kid Arachnid]]. Although unaffected by Kid Arachnid's venom blasts, Spider-Man and Webslinger eventually were able to defeat Doc Ock Holliday. Upon Doc Holliday's defeat, Ben is freed from the brainwashing and remanded Doc Ock Holliday to the hoosegow while reclaiming his Sheriff title. As Ben and Webslinger are reunited, Spider-Man gets a final look at Ben before departing to the next reality, quietly hopeful that one reality has Ben still alive.
* Uncle Ben appears in the 2017 TV series ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Patton Oswalt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techiegamers.com/2387-2/ |title=âMarvelâs Spider-Manâ Has Secured A Notable Name To Voice Uncle Ben |last=Morgan |first=Chris |date=4 July 2017 |access-date=14 May 2018 |work=Techie Gamers}}</ref>

===Film===
* In the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' film series]], Ben Parker is portrayed by [[Cliff Robertson]] and his character remains relatively faithful to the comics, including his being shot by a criminal Peter failed to stop (although in the comics he was shot trying to defend May during a break in at their house and in the film he was shot during a [[carjacking]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Montalbano |first=Dave |title=The Adventures of Cinema Dave in the Florida Motion Picture World |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=hvfExNxOXpsC&pg=PA523 |publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]] |date=22 December 2010 |page=523 |isbn=9781462836734}}</ref>
** He appeared in the [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|first film]] as a father figure for Peter. The amiable Ben is laid off from his job as a chief [[electrician]] after 35 years and worries about his nephew's strange behavior. His words of wisdom ('With great power comes great responsibility') eventually inspire Peter to become Spider-Man. Losing his temper during this speech, Peter tells him to stop acting like his father, hurting his feelings badly. Later that night, Ben is apparently shot dead by a [[Burglar (comics)|thief]], Dennis Carradine, whom Peter refused to stop when he was cheated out of his money. Peter and his aunt greatly mourn his death, particularly Peter, who is haunted by the fact that he could have stopped Carradine and saved his uncle. By the end of the film, Peter has accepted Ben as the father figure of his childhood.
** The [[Spider-Man 2|second film]] features a sequence where Peter contemplates giving up his Spider-Man identity to Ben who, in the flashback, is a physical representation of the entity and ideology of Spider-Man, encouraging Peter to continue on as a superhero. Also, Peter admits the truth surrounding Uncle Ben's death to Aunt May. She is shocked and upset at first, but later commends Peter for telling her the truth.
** Robertson reprised his role in a flashback scene (as well as a dream sequence) in the [[Spider-Man 3|third film]] (his final acting role). In the film, Captain [[George Stacy]] tells Peter and Aunt May of new evidence that suggests Carradine was only an accomplice of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]], who was Uncle Ben's real killer; Peter then imagines Marko throwing Ben out of the car and gunning him down in cold blood while Carradine desperately tries to stop Marko before driving off. Robertson appears again at the end of the film during a more accurate flashback, as Marko explains to Peter that he only wanted Ben's car, since Marko needed to steal money to help his critically ill daughter Penny. However, Carradine startled Marko and caused him to accidentally fire his gun when Ben was trying to reason with him. This somewhat shocked Marko, as he feels extremely remorseful for killing Ben. Realizing how desperate Marko is to help his own daughter and understanding the importance of forgiveness over revenge, Spider-Man forgives Marko and allows him to go free.
* [[Martin Sheen]] portrays Uncle Ben in the 2012 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Though his character still remains faithful to the comics, the manner of his murder is drastically different. Following an argument with Peter which results in Peter storming out, Ben leaves to find his nephew and encounters a thief who has just raided a grocery store where Peter was shopping but who Peter refused to stop when he did not provide enough money to pay for a drink (and who also discreetly tossed Peter the drink). The thief trips over and drops his gun. Ben tries to get the gun first, but a struggle ensues and Ben is killed. Unlike the comics, Ben's killer remains at large.
* The screenwriter for ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', [[John Francis Daley]], confirms that Uncle Ben exists in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] despite never being referenced directly in the film (though Peter does mention that Aunt May's been through a lot lately which was an intentional nod to the character). In an earlier draft of the film, May mentions that Peter's wardrobe for homecoming was Ben's clothing, but it was cut out because the screenwriters didn't want his death to be a throwaway line.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mueller |first=Matthew |title=Uncle Ben Confirmed For The Marvel Cinematic Universe |url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/08/02/spider-man-homecoming-uncle-been-confirmed/ |date=2 August 2017 |access-date=14 May 2018 |work=Comic Book}}</ref>
* In the 2018 film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', Uncle Ben appears briefly uttering his famous quote. The audio is taken straight from Cliff Robertson from the first Spider-Man movie.

===Video games===
* Uncle Ben is mentioned in the first 3 missions, "Search for Justice," "Warehouse Hunt," and "Birth of a Hero" in the 2002 ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, as Peter Parker attempts to track down Ben's killer.
* Uncle Ben is briefly mentioned at the end of ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/04/13/too-much-plot-too-little-movie-spider-man-3/ |title=Too Much Plot, Too Little Movie â Spider-Man 3 |last=DeCandido |first=Keith R.A. |date=13 April 2018 |access-date=14 May 2018 |work=[[Tor.com]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]}}</ref>
* Uncle Ben's Noir version is mentioned by [[Spider-Man Noir]] in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'' when going after the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (that universe's killer of Uncle Ben).
* Uncle Ben makes an appearance in the prologue of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', voiced by Mark Bramhall. The tutorial starts off showing the event that lead to his death. After that, he is referenced throughout the game by Peter Parker, Aunt May, and [[Stan Lee|Stan]]. Around the end of the game, Stan tells Peter that Ben would've wanted him to grow up to be the man that he wanted Peter to be.
* Uncle Ben appears in photographs and is mentioned in ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider Man]]''. He can be seen in the opening sequence in a picture frame in Peter Parker's apartment when a player starts a new save file. At the end of the game, a funeral is held for Aunt May and she is buried next to Uncle Ben. His grave can be seen as an Easter Egg in the game and unlocks the achievement once the player prompts Spider-Man to pay respects at the grave with Peter Parker saying "[He] miss him so much".

==Franklin Richards' Uncle Ben==
[[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] often refers to Benjamin Grimm, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], as "Uncle Ben" (Grimm is the best friend of Franklin's father [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]). Franklin Richards and Peter Parker also have the same middle name, Benjamin, as the Thing and Ben Parker are their [[namesake]]s. Spider-Man is aware of this, and told Franklin, "Uncle Bens are always right."<ref>{{cite comic |title=The Amazing Spider-Man |issue=660 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |date=11 May 2011 |writer=[[Fred Van Lente]], [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]], [[Dan Slott]] |penciller=[[Stefano Caselli]], [[Mike McKone]], [[Lee Garbett]] |inker=Stefano Caselli, Mike McKone, Alejandro Sicat |colorist=Marte Gracia, Fabio D'Auria |letterer=Joe Caramagna |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/35505/amazing_spider-man_1999_660 |id=35505}}</ref>

==Son of Spider-Man==
In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #498-500, Spider-Man falls through time, encountering all of his enemies from the past, and sees himself in the future. The future Peter Parker tells him that he should tell [[Mary Jane Watson]] and their son that he loves them every day. "Our son is called Ben", he says, "but it would pretty much have to be, wouldn't it?" However, because of the way time-travel in the Marvel universe works, it should be noted that this is only a potential future, not necessarily a definite one (This future being even more unlikely after the events of ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'').

==The Other Uncle Ben==
{{Main|Spider-Girl}}
Like her father, [[Spider-Girl]] also has an Uncle Ben.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-greatest-spider-women-of-all-time-ranked-1796904543 |title=The Greatest Spider-Women of All Time, Ranked |last=Whitbrook |first=James |date=14 July 2011 |access-date=14 May 2018 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]]}}</ref> However, unlike her dad, May never knew her uncle: [[Ben Reilly]], Spider-Man's clone. If Spider-Girl has any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben - May's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]]. Ironically in the aftermath of ''Spider-Verse'', the Earth-3145's Ben Parker himself would  stay on her world, and has a chance to be his grandfather, something that the other Ben Parkers were unable to achieve on account of their deaths.
