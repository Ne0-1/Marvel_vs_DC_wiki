The '''Ultra-Humanite''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #13 (June 1939), and was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]].

==Publication history==
===Golden Age===
Debuting as an enemy of [[Superman]] in ''Action Comics'' #13 (June 1939), Ultra-Humanite is considered to be the first [[supervillain]] in comic books. <ref>[http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Supervillains DC.Wikia.com » Supervillains]</ref> The character was convinced to be the polar opposite of Superman; while Superman is a hero with superhuman strength, Ultra-Humanite is a criminal mastermind who has a crippled body but a highly advanced intellect.

Superman first discovers the Ultra-Humanite as the mastermind behind a series of crimes with criminals wielding advanced technological weapons. After a series of battles with Superman, the Ultra-Humanite is presumed killed when his weapon explodes. Superman later encounters him alive in the body of actress [[Delores Winters]]. The villain explains that he kidnapped Winters and replaced her brain with his own. He attempts to use his new appearance to ransom a group of celebrities on the ship ''The Sea Serpent'' for $5,000,000, but Superman defeats him again.

Siegel and Shuster replaced the Ultra-Humanite as Superman's archfoe when [[Lex Luthor]] was introduced into the Superman comic. Originally, Luthor was depicted as a mad scientist with a full head of red hair. An artist later mistakenly drew Luthor with a bald head and Siegel approved of Luthor's new look.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/30/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-79/ Comics Should Be Good! » Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #79]</ref> Because Siegel and Shuster didn't need two bald mad scientists battling Superman, they dropped the Ultra-Humanite from Superman comics in favor of Luthor. The Ultra-Humanite made his last ''Superman'' appearance in ''Action Comics'' #21 (1940), where he kidnaps an inventor and forces them to build a disintegration ray to extort $2,000,000, and made no further comic book appearances for several decades.

===Silver Age and the Multiverse===
With the introduction of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system, the continuity of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Superman stories and the Ultra-Humanite were retroactively placed on Earth-Two, the Earth of DC's Golden Age characters. The Ultra-Humanite was reintroduced during the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] as a recurring villain in the ''Mr. and Mrs. Superman'' feature in the ''[[Superman Family]]'' anthology comic. ''Mr. and Mrs. Superman'' consists of stories about the early years of the marriage between the [[Kal-L|Earth-Two Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]], and features a number of Golden Age Superman villains of which the Ultra-Humanite is the most prominent. In the annual JLA/JSA teamup in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #195-197, the Ultra-Humanite transfers his consciousness to an albino ape body and becomes a major super-villain of Earth-Two. Afterwards, he regularly appears in DC comics fighting against the [[All-Star Squadron]] in the 1940s and against the [[Justice Society of America]] and [[Infinity, Inc.]] in the decades since World War II.

===Post-Crisis===
After the 1985-1986 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Superman's history was rewritten in ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' miniseries, and the Earth-Two Superman was removed from continuity. However, the Ultra-Humanite was excluded from Superman's reboot, and his post-''Crisis'' history remained tied to the 1940s and to the Justice Society of America and All-Star Squadron. Previous appearances of the Ultra-Humanite fighting Golden Age Superman in the 1940s in ''Action Comics'' #13-21 and in ''All-Star Squadron'' were re-told for the sake of continuity (a technique known as [[Retroactive continuity|retconning]]) to show him having fought other 1940s heroes.

The Ultra-Humanite's most ambitious scheme occurs in the 2002 "Stealing Thunder" story arc from ''JSA'' #32-37, where, in the aged body of [[Johnny Thunder]], he deceives [[Jakeem Thunder]] into handing over his magical pen. With the power of the omnipotent Thunderbolt, the Ultra-Humanite first restores his body's youth, and then proceeds to take over the world. Under his rule, Earth is transformed into essentially a single mind, with nearly every metahuman becoming an extension of the Ultra-Humanite.

However, a select few heroes manage to escape the control of the Ultra-Humanite: Jakeem Thunder, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]], the third [[Crimson Avenger]], [[Power Girl]], [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]], and the second [[Icicle (comics)#Cameron Mahkent|Icicle]]. [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] and [[Hector Hall]] are also free--Wildcat as an apparent side effect of his 'nine lives', and Hall so that he could summon the garb of [[Doctor Fate]] and thus provide the Ultra-Humanite with access to Nabu's power.  However, both are held captive by the Ultra-Humanite. The Ultra-Humanite is seemingly killed by the Crimson Avenger (although the Icicle nearly beats her to it) as revenge for the death of the first Crimson Avenger, who dies earlier in an explosion triggered by the Ultra-Humanite.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
After the events of [[Infinite Crisis]], history was altered to bring Dolores Winters (now called [[Delores Winters]]) back to life via the reveal that her brain was placed in a new body after Ultra-Humanite stole her body for his own use in the pages of ''JSA Classified'' #19-20 (2007). In ''Power Girl'' (vol. 2) #2 (2009), the Ultra-Humanite's secret origin is revised, shedding more light on his past life as a genius youth, '''Gerard Shugel''' (a name derived from Superman creators Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel). He was born with both an intellect that surpassed the world's greatest minds and a degenerative disease that was slowly eating away at him. He used his intellect to find ways to keep the disease at bay, while trying to find a way to transplant his brain into a healthy body. 

Working with a reckless and young Satanna, a fellow college researcher, they worked together at their brain/transplant and animal hybridization technologies. Forced to relocate in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and beset by rebel forces and the military, Satanna was forced, as a stop-gap measure, to transplant the healthy brain of Gerarld into the altered body of a gorilla albino ape. They shared an intimate relationship for a while, then they parted way for a long time, paving the way for their separate adventures as chronicled pre-OYL.

In the 2006-2007 "Lightning Saga" crossover between Justice Society of America and Justice League of America, the untold story of how Ultra-Humanite transitioned from Delores Winter's body to his albino-ape form was revealed: [[Per Degaton]], the villainous time traveler, and a young version of [[Despero]] rescued the Delores Winters-version of Ultra-Humanite from a hospital in the year 1948. It is revealed that the Ultra-Humanite was stricken with terminal [[cancer]] and in exchange for his loyalty, Per Degaton agreed to provide a new body for the villain, in the form of a rare albino ape from the secret civilization known as [[Gorilla City]]. Christening themselves the "Time Stealers", they align themselves with [[Mr. Mind]], Rex Hunter, the mysterious "Black Beetle", and the villainous father of [[Booster Gold]] in an attempt to manipulate time for their own selfish goals. However, their conspiracy ultimately unravels at the hands of Booster Gold and [[Blue Beetle]] Ted Kord. In the end, Ultra-Humanite and Despero were sent back into the past after their group were defeated, while other members were returned to their previous places in time. 

In ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #1 (2006), Ultra-Humanite is said to still be alive and well, having stolen a copy of Steve Dayton's "[[Mento (comics)|Mento]]" helmet. 

Later on Ultra-Humanite is seen aiding the [[Reach]] in their plans to conquer Earth; he is defeated by [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]] and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]. Most recently he appears in the first arc of ''[[Power Girl]]'' (vol. 2), using an anti-gravity mechanism to raise New York City into the air, holding the city [[hostage]] in exchange to transfer his mind into Power Girl's body. The attempt fails, and Power Girl accidentally scars his whole body with acid burns, maiming his form for good.

Satanna returns to New York, attempting to aid her former lover, stealing the body of the current [[Terra (comics)#Atlee|Terra]], Atlee to give that for Gerard's use. After a lengthy fight, however, Power Girl is able to retrieve Terra's brain (now in the crippled simian form of the Ultra-Humanite) and bring both of them to Strata, Atlee's advanced underground birth society, to get her friend restored to her proper body. Strata's scientist agree to clone a new, fully human body for Gerard Shugel, resembling an healthy version of his twenty years old human self, cured from his degenerative disease. Power Girl agrees to hire him as a scientist for her Starr Labs, and Gerard plays along showing a fake desire of reformation.<ref>''Power Girl'' #11</ref>

His best-known and most frequently revisited form is that of a mutated [[albinism|albino]] [[gorilla]].

==Other versions==
* An alternate Ultra-Humanite appears in issues three and four of the ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent]]: Superman's Reign'' series. This version is a living weapon created by the Soviets, that went out of control. He is allegedly destroyed in battle by the Tangent version of Superman, but it is later revealed that he was preserved and reprogrammed to fight for the Tangent's Superman's cause.  He is finally destroyed by the combined efforts of the Tangent Batman and New Earth Superman.
* Ultra-Humanite appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' #3. The character targets the President causing Batman and Green Arrow to team up and stop Ultra-Humanite. The reason established for him switching his mind into apes is that he didn't want people to mistake him for Lex Luthor.<ref>Secret Batfiles from Batman: The Brave and The Bold #3</ref>
*The first three issues of ''Legends of the DC Universe'' feature the post-Crisis Superman, early in his career, battling a scientist named Morgan Wilde who, angered by the death of his wife, swore revenge on Luthor and gains the ability to transfer his "life essence" (called "Under-Light") as the U.L.T.R.A. Humanite.
*In the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries, ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]'', the Ultra-Humanite places his brain into the body of [[Tex Thomson]], known as the "Americommando". He also arranges to place the brain of his ally, [[Adolf Hitler]], into the body of [[Dan the Dyna-Mite|Danny Dunbar]], while simultaneously arranging to give Hitler (as Dunbar) super-powers.
*The Ultra-Humanite is the principal villain in the [[John Byrne]] limited series ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]''. He first appears in the 1939 story, but is believed to be killed when his escape rocket explodes. Decades later, it is revealed that the Humanite had his brain placed in the body of his lackey [[Lex Luthor]], and posed as Luthor for the intervening time.  He then attempts to swap bodies with a then-powerless Superman, but is killed when Superman, attempting to escape, throws a metal spar into Humanite's computer, causing it to electrocute the villain.
