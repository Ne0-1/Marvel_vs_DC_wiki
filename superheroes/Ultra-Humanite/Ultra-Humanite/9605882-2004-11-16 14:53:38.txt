'''The Ultra-Humanite''' was a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]; his gimmick was that he could transfer his brain into any body. Various bodies occupied included Dolores Winters, an actress; The [[Americommando]], a giant [[insect]], a [[tyrannosaurus rex]], a mutated [[albino]] [[gorilla]] (his most well-known form), [[Johnny Thunder]], and a glass dome. Some bodies exist only in alternate timelines, however.

Ultra-Humanite was the first [[supervillain]] ever faced by [[Superman]] (whose previous foes had all consisted of various one-shot gangsters or thieves), which arguably makes him the first supervillain ever. He was designed as the polar opposite of Superman; while Superman was a hero with superhuman strength, Ultra-Humanite was a criminal mastermind who had a crippled body but a highly advanced intellect. His early appearances have been retconned to other heroes than Superman (as he didn't exist until the second or first last decade of the 20th century).

In the mainstream DC timeline, The Ultra-Humanite was killed by the third [[Crimson Avenger]] in the "Stealing Thunder" storyline. This was done to avenge the first Crimson Avenger, who was killed in a explosion triggered by The Ultra-Humanite.
