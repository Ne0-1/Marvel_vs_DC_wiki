'''The Ultra-Humanite''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The Ultra-Humanite first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #13 in [[1939]].

The Ultra-Humanite, a [[mad scientist]], had as his main talent the ability to transfer his brain into any body. Various bodies occupied over the years included Dolores Winters, an actress; the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] [[superhero]] the [[Americommando]]; a giant [[insect]]; a [[tyrannosaurus rex]]; a mutated [[albino]] [[gorilla]] (his most well-known form); [[Justice Society of America]] member [[Johnny Thunder]]; and a glass dome. Some of these events happened only in alternate [[timeline]]s, however.  In an [[Elseworlds]]  tale, ''Superman and Batman: Generations'', the Ultra-Humanite had transferred his mind into [[Lex Luthor]], pointing out the obvious similarities between the two villains.

Ultra-Humanite was the first [[supervillain]] ever faced by [[Superman]] (whose previous foes had all consisted of various one-shot gangsters or thieves), and is usually considered as the first supervillain in [[United States|American]] superhero comics. He was designed as the polar opposite of Superman: while Superman was a hero with superhuman strength, Ultra-Humanite was a criminal mastermind who had a crippled body but a highly advanced intellect. Over the years, Ultra-Humanite also expanded his battles to include the Justice Society.

More recently, the Ultra-Humanite was killed by the third [[Crimson Avenger]] in the ''Stealing Thunder'' comic storyline. This was done to avenge the first Crimson Avenger, who was killed in a explosion triggered by the Ultra-Humanite.

==Other media==
The Ultra-Humanite appears in his gorilla body form in three episodes of the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]] voiced by [[Ian Buchanan]].  In this version, he is depicted as a cultured intellectual criminal with a deep love for [[european classical music|classical music]] so much so that he was persuaded by [[Batman]] to turn in [[Lex Luthor]] in exchange for a massive donation to [[public broadcasting]]. 

He appears to be more interested in serving out his jailtime by this point. His origin is questionable since this world lacks a JSA for him to fight, although he deliberately cut off a passing reference of enjoying Christmas in his youth. Presumably he first appeared more recently.
