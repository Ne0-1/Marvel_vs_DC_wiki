'''The Ultra-Humanite''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The Ultra-Humanite first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #13 in [[1939]] and is generally considered to be the first comic-book supervillain.

== Powers ==
The Ultra-Humanite, a [[mad scientist]], had as his main power the ability to transfer his brain into any body. Various bodies occupied over the years included: Dolores Winters, an actress; a giant [[insect]]; a [[tyrannosaurus rex]]; a mutated [[albino]] [[gorilla]] (his most well-known and most frequently revisited form); [[Justice Society of America]] member [[Johnny Thunder]]; and a glass dome. Some of these events happened only in alternate [[timeline]]s, however.

== History ==
=== Golden Age ===
The Ultra-Humanite is the first [[supervillain]] ever faced by [[Superman]],  and is usually considered as the first supervillain in [[superhero]] comics. He was designed to be the polar opposite of Superman: while Superman was a hero with superhuman strength, Ultra-Humanite was a criminal mastermind who had a crippled body but a highly advanced intellect.

Superman first discovers Ultra-Humanite as the mastermind behind a series of crimes with criminals wielding advanced technological weapons. After a series of battles with Superman, Ultra-Humanite is seemingly killed. Superman later encounters Ultra-Humanite alive in the body of actress Dolores Winters. Ultra-Humanite explains that he kidnapped Dolores Winters and replaced her brain with his own.

Shortly afterwards, Siegal and Shuster replaced Ultra-Humanite as Superman's archfoe when [[Luthor]] is introduced to the Superman comic. Originally, Luthor was a mad scientist with a full head of red hair. An artist later mistakenly drew Luthor with a bald head and Siegel approved of Luthor's new look.<ref>http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/30/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-79/</ref> Because Siegel and Shuster didn't need two bald mad scientists battling Superman, they dropped Ultra-Humanite from Superman comics in favor of Luthor. Ultra-Humanite makes his last Superman appearance in ''Action Comics'' #21 (1939) and made no further appearances for several decades.

=== Bronze Age and the Multiverse ===
With the introduction of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system, the continuity of Golden Age Superman stories and the Ultra-Humanite were retroactively placed on Earth-Two, the Earth of DC's Golden Age characters. Ultra-Humanite is reintroduced during the Bronze Age as a recurring villain in the ''Mr. and Mrs. Superman'' feature in the ''[[Superman Family]]'' anthology comic. ''Mr. and Mrs. Superman'' told stories about the early years of the marriage of the Earth-Two Superman and Lois Lane and featured a number of Golden Age Superman villains of which the Ultra-Humanite was the most prominent. In the annual JLA/JSA teamup in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #195-197, Ultra-Humanite would adopt his white albino ape body and have his role expanded as a major super-villain of Earth-Two. Afterwards, the Ultra-Humanite would make regular appearances fighting against the [[All-Star Squadron]] in the 1940s and against the [[Justice Society of America]] and [[Infinity Inc]]. in the present.

=== Post-Crisis ===
After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Superman's continuity was rebooted by the Man of Steel miniseries and Earth-Two Superman was removed from continuity. However, the Ultra-Humanite was excluded from Superman's reboot and his post-Crisis history remains tied to the 1940s and with the Justice Society of America and the All-Star Squadron. Previous appearances of the Ultra-Humanite fighting Golden Age Superman in the 1940s in ''Action Comics'' #13-21 and in ''All-Star Squadron'' were re-told for the sake of continuity (a technique known as [[retcon|retconning]]) to show him having fought other 1940s heroes.

The first three issues of ''[[Legends of the DC Universe]]'' feature the post-Crisis Superman, early in his career, battling a scientist who has sworn revenge on Luthor and gained the ability to transfer his "life essence" (called "Under-Light") as the U.L.T.R.A. Humanite. The [[canon (fiction)|continuity]] of this story is unclear.

The Ultra-Humanite was killed by the third [[Crimson Avenger]] in the "Stealing Thunder" JSA comic storyline as revenge for the death of the first Crimson Avenger, who was killed in an explosion triggered by the Ultra-Humanite. However, after the Infinite Crisis, another Ultra-Humanite character was mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' (2nd series) #1, but so far it's unclear if it's the same Humanite or a new character. It was said Ultra-Humanite tried to buy a new mento-helmet and was mentioned to have established a new (but unknown) identity for himself in order to do that. But, what Ultra-Humanite didn't know, was that his mission was snitched by [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] who warned the heroes about it, and Ultra-Humanite was stopped once again.

== Elseworlds ==
In the miniseries, ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]'', the Ultra-Humanite placed his brain into the body of the [[superhero]], the [[Americommando]].

In ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', the Ultra-Humanite had transferred his mind into [[Lex Luthor]], highlighting the  similarities between the two villains.

==Other media==
[[Image:JLChristmas.jpg|frame|The Ultra-Humanite and [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]] in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'']]
The Ultra-Humanite appears in his gorilla body form in three episodes of the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' [[animated series]] voiced by [[Ian Buchanan]].  In this version, he is depicted as a cultured intellectual criminal with a deep love for [[european classical music|classical music]]. This appreciation of music becomes a major component of the Ultra-Humanite's character when [[Batman]] persuades the Ultra-Humanite to turn over [[Lex Luthor]] to the authorities in return for a large sum of money, which Ultra-Humanite then donates to [[public broadcasting]], specifically opera on television.

The Ultra-Humanite's  origin in the animated series is questionable since this world did not include an explicit JSA for him to fight, but a passing reference while talking to [[the Flash]] during the Christmas episode suggests he once had a more normal appearance.
