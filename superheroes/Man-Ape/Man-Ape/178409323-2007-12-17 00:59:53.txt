'''Man-Ape''' is a [[fictional character]], a supervillain in the {{Marvel Universe}}, and frequent enemy of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. He first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #62 (March 1969)

==Fictional character biography==
'''M'Baku''' was one of [[Wakanda]]'s greatest warriors, second only to the Black Panther. He plotted to usurp the throne with the help of the outlawed rival ''White [[Gorilla]]'' cult. M'Baku gains his powers by bathing in white gorilla blood and eating white gorilla flesh and took the alias of Man-Ape. He fought with the Black Panther and was believed to be dead when the Panther Totem that the Black Panther was bound to crumbled on him. N'Gamo revived him and Man-Ape went to America where the Black Panther was with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] at the time. He joined a group of villains that went to attack Black Panther's allies the Fantastic Four. He allied himself with the Lethal Legion made up of [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], and [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. Man-Ape bested Black Panther again until he was defeated by [[Captain America]]. Black Panther banned Man-Ape from Wakanda and will be executed if he returned. Man-Ape traveled to uninhabited parts of the world before joining the seventh incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] which were defeated by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Despite the rivalry with T'Challa, M'Baku was invited to the wedding of T'Challa and Ororo Munroe (also known as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]]), where he got drunk on scotch tried to pick a fight with [[Spider-Man]].

Man-Ape is next seen at the end of ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #6, teamed with [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] & Saboteur.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to supernatural enchantment, the Man Ape gained mystical powers by consuming the flesh of a sacred white gorilla. M'Baku's mystically augmented powers include superhuman strength enabling him to lift 10 tons, and the enhanced agility, stamina, and durability of the mystical Wakandan white gorilla. He has extensive formal military training in hand to hand combat.
