'''Man-Ape''' is a [[fictional character]], a supervillain in the {{Marvel Universe}}, and frequent enemy of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. He first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #62 (March 1969)

==Fictional character biography==
'''M'Baku''' was born in [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], in Northern Africa. He became one of Wakanda's greatest warriors, second only to the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. He plotted to usurp the throne of Wakanda with the help of the outlawed rival ''White [[Gorilla]]'' cult and return Wakanda to a primitive state. M'Baku becomes a renegade and gains his powers by bathing in white gorilla blood and eating white gorilla flesh, taking the alias of '''Man-Ape'''. He fought with the Black Panther and was believed to be dead when the Panther Totem that the Black Panther was bound to crumbled on him.<ref>''Avengers'' #62</ref> N'Gamo revived him and Man-Ape went to America where the Black Panther was with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] at the time.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He joined a group of villains that went to attack Black Panther's allies the Fantastic Four.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He allied himself with the original [[Lethal Legion]] made up of [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], and [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Man-Ape bested Black Panther again until he was defeated by [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Black Panther banned Man-Ape from Wakanda on order of execution if he returned.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Man-Ape later joined a new Lethal Legion (consisting of the Grim Reaper, [[Black Talon (comics)#Black Talon II|Black Talon]], Goliath (Erik Josten), [[Nekra]], and [[Ultron|Ultron-12]]) and battled [[Tigra]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #1-2</ref> He then abandoned the Grim Reaper, accompanied by Black Talon.<ref>''Vision and Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>

Man-Ape traveled to uninhabited parts of the world before joining the seventh incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] which were defeated by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Despite the rivalry with T'Challa, M'Baku was invited to the wedding of T'Challa and Ororo Munroe (also known as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]]), where he got drunk on scotch and tried to pick a fight with [[Spider-Man]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Man-Ape is next seen at the end of ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #6, teamed with [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] & Saboteur.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #6</ref>

Man-Ape was killed by [[Morlun]], the Devourer of Totems while defending his people from Morlun's attack on the Man-Ape's kingdom. But before his death, he sent an envoy to Wakanda to warn them of the approaching danger.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol.4 #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Man Ape gained superhuman powers by consuming the flesh of a sacred white gorilla, enchanting him through the mystical transference of the abilities of the rare Wakandan white gorilla. M'Baku's mystically augmented powers include superhuman strength, and the enhanced agility, stamina, and durability equal to that of the mystical Wakandan white gorilla.

He has extensive formal military training in hand to hand combat from the Wakandan Royal Militia.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate M'Baku===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, M'Baku is the name of T'Challa's older brother. After the young T'Challa failed to complete the "Trial of the Black Panther", M'Baku derided him, saying that he should have taken the trial instead. Later, angry that his father had decided to share Wakanda’s technology in exchange for America’s help in saving T’Challa’s life, M'Baku left the kingdom.<ref>''Ultimate Captain America Annual'' #1</ref>

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Man-Ape appears as a boss for the Wakanda level in the PS2, PSP, NDS, and Wii versions of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''. In fashion similar to his comic book origin, M'Baku leads an attack on Wakanda in a bid to usurp the throne from T'Challa whilst the country is incapacitated by a wave of hostile [[nanite]] machines.
