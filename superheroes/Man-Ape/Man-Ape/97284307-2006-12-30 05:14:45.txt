'''Man-Ape''' is a [[fictional character]], a supervillain in the {{Marvel Universe}}, and frequent enemy of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. He first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #62 (March 1969)

==Fictional character biography==
'''M'Baku''' is one of [[Wakanda]]'s greatest warriors, second only to the Black Panther. He plotted to usurp the throne with the help of the outlawed rival ''White [[Gorilla]]'' cult. M'Baku gains his powers by bathing in white gorilla blood and eating white gorilla flesh and took the alias of Man-Ape. He fought with the Black Panther and was believed to be dead when the Panther Totem that the Black Panther was bound to crumbled on him. N'Gamo revived him and Man-Ape went to America where the Black Panther was with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] at the time. He allied himself with the Lethal Legion made up of [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man I]], and [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. Man-Ape bested Black Panther again until he was defeated by [[Captain America]]. Black Panther banned Man-Ape from Wakanda and will be executed if he returned. Man-Ape traveled to uninhabited parts of the world before joining the 7th incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] which were defeated by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Despite the rivalry with T'Challa, M'Baku was invited to the wedding of T'Challa and Ororo Munroe (also known as [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]]), where he got drunk on scotch tried to pick a fight with [[Spider-Man]].
