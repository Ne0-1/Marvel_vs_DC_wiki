'''Valeria Richards''' is a [[fictional character]] of [[Marvel Comics]], the daughter of [[Mister Fantastic]] (Reed Richards) and the [[Invisible Woman]] (Susan Storm Richards), husband and wife and two members of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]]. She is the younger sister of [[Franklin Richards]] (though because of [[time travel]] she has sometimes been older than her brother). Valeria made her first appearance under the name '''Valeria Von Doom''' and the code name '''Marvel Girl'''.

==History==

Valeria Von Doom first appeared during the run of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Salvador Larroca]] on ''Fantastic Four'', suddenly materialising in the Fantastic Four's headquarters, professing to be from the future, and the daughter of [[Doctor Doom]] (Victor Von Doom) and the Invisible Woman. This was, unsurprisingly, very disturbing to the Fantastic Four, but after an initial period of conflict, the Invisible Woman accepted Valeria into the FF's home, and she aided them on several missions. 

It was unknown how Doctor Doom and the Invisible Woman would come together in the future, and how Mister Fantastic would be removed from the picture. Things seemed to be coming together when Mister Fantastic became trapped in Doom's armour, and publically pretended to be the villain, re-marrying Sue and making her his baroness. At this time, Valeria was sent to Haven, a safe house at the end of the universe, for her own protection, but as events proceeded, Reed was freed from the armour, again calling Valeria's future into question.

However Chris Claremont intended to resolve the storyline, he never got the chance, as [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Carlos Pacheco]] took over ''Fantastic Four'' and brought Valeria back into the title, [[retcon]]ning the character's origins. As it transpired, Valeria was, in fact, the second, unborn child of Reed and Sue Richards, who had been miscarried years before. Under the guidance of [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], Franklin had used his powers to save the child, who was taken by Roma, who knew that the girl would serve a great purpose in the future. In the comics themselves, Roma professed to have cared for the girl, but the [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] took the opportunity to tie up some loose ends by claiming that Valeria was actually raised in an alternate future as the daughter of Doom and Sue. Loeb and Pachecho brought Valeria back into the book as the FF went up against the cosmic menace of [[Abraxas (comics)|Abraxas]], and Valeria fulfilled her purpose by merging her powers with Franklin and recreating [[Galactus]] to stop Abraxas. In the restructuring of reality that ensued, Valeria was regressed to a fetus within Sue's womb once again, on the cusp of being born again.

As had occurred during the first time she was born, the [[cosmic ray]]s that gave the Fantastic Four their superpowers made the [[childbirth|delivery]] of Valeria extremely difficult, and because Mister Fantastic was caught up solving a world-threatening crisis, the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] had no choice but to call upon Victor Von Doom for help, as detailed in ''Fantastic Four'' v3 #54 (June [[2002]]). Doctor Doom was qualified to deliver the baby because of his vast intelligence and his [[mystic]]al capabilities, and he successfully delivered the baby through a difficult birth.

As the price for his help, Doctor Doom insisted that he be allowed to name the child. He did so, naming her Valeria after a woman he had loved in the past (ironically, Doctor Doom would also eventually be the murderer of this woman). Unknown to the Fantastic Four, Doctor Doom also placed a spell on Valeria, making her his [[familiar spirit]], as revealed in the ''Unthinkable'' [[story arc]], ''Fantastic Four'' v3 #67-70 and v1 #500 (May-September [[2003]]) by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Mike Wieringo]]. The Fantastic Four were eventually able to free Valeria from Doom's control.

==Superpowers and abilities==

As Marvel Girl, Valeria Von Doom exhibited several [[superpower]]s, though the exact extent of her abilities is unknown. She was able to transform into an armored form, with the design of the [[armor]] somewhat derivative of Doctor Doom's. She inherited the ability of her mother to project [[force field]]s, though she never displayed the ability to turn [[invisible]]. She also seemed to have enhanced strength and durability, being able to punch strongly enough to knock beings with superstrength down and survive punches by beings with superstrength, though it is possible that her apparent strength and durability was actually simply subtle application of her force fields and the defense provided by her armor. In addition, Valeria Von Doom showed an intelligence and aptitude for invention and technology rivaling that of Doctor Doom or Mister Fantastic.

As Valeria Richards, Valeria is only a child. In ''Fantastic Four'' v3 #53 (January [[2003]]), she was tested for superpowers by her father, Mister Fantastic, and found to have no superhuman abilities. It is also not known whether she is a [[genius]] like her previous incarnation, Valeria Von Doom, or her father, Mister Fantastic. However, as she is only a child, it is possible that she may manifest superhuman abilities in the future.

In Marvel Knights 4, in a recent adventure, Johnny Storm travelled to an alternate future and was saved from Doombots by a grown-up Valeria. She had a superior version of her mother's invisibility powers, allowing her to shield someone's bioelectric aura, kinetic energy, heat energy, and other evidence of their existence.
