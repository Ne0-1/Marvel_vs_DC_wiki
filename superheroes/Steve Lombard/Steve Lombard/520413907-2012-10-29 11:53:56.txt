==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths===
[[Image:Lombard.jpg|thumb|left|Steve Lombard's first appearance.  Art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In [[Pre-Crisis]] continuity, Steve "The Slinger" Lombard is a former [[quarterback]] for the fictional [[NFL]] team the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] Meteors.  Steve injures his knee while saving a baby falling from a building.  An experimental radiation treatment cures his knee injury, but also produces an energy being that resembles Lombard.  The energy being responds to Lombard's thoughts, and begins scoring touchdowns in his place.  At first taking credit for the energy being's performance, Lombard is forced to confess the truth after the energy being goes on a rampage and has to be stopped by Superman.  He is subsequently hired by [[Morgan Edge]] to become a sportscaster for Galaxy Broadcasting, working alongside anchor [[Clark Kent]] on the Six O'Clock News.<ref name="superman264">{{Cite comic | writer = Cary Bates | penciller = Curt Swan | inker = Murphy Anderson | story = Secret of the Phantom Quarterback! | title = '''Superman''' | volume = 1 | issue = 264 | date = '''June 1973''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref>

Steve is portrayed as brash and overly self-confident, and often plays pranks on Clark Kent, which he is usually able to counter with the subtle usage of his powers (referring to him by the unflattering nickname "Clarkie"). However, Steve also considers Clark one of his few real friends, since he takes Steve's attitude in stride and never bears him a grudge. Steve has a brother who is a doctor named Vernon Lombard. Steve has a nephew named Jaime Lombard.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Elliot S!

===Post-Crisis===
Lombard was not part of the original reboot of the ''Superman'' storyline that began in [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' mini-series.  His first [[Post-Crisis]] appearance is as a news anchor on WGBS-TV in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #467 (June 1990). 

As of the June 2008 storyline, Lombard works for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', as the editor of the Sports section.<ref>
{{Cite comic | writer = Geoff Johns | penciller = Gary Frank | inker = Jonathan Sibal | story = Brainiac, Part 1: First Contact | title = '''[[Action Comics]]''' | volume = | issue = 866 | date = '''August 2008''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref> [[Perry White]] states Steve Lombard has recently returned to the paper, so it can be assumed that Steve used to work there before leaving to work for WGBS. ''Action Comics Annual'' #11 (May 2008) gives the following information on Steve: "''Sports Reporter. Steve Lombard played football in high school, college, and briefly for the pros. He sees himself as a man's man, everything Clark Kent is not in fact. He is a walking encyclopedia of sports trivia and put-downs. Lombard cannot figure out why [[Lois Lane]] does not throw herself at him.''" It is also stated that Steve Lombard often butts heads with [[Ron Troupe]] on nearly everything. 

His personality is featured in the 2008 'Brainiac' storyline. He makes a crude sexual advance to Lois Lane right in front of Clark Kent. He insults Ron Troupe's choice of subject matter, thinking articles critical of sports means Ron 'hates' them. He takes great joy in assaulting colleagues with a football, laughing at their torment. However, once actual danger arises he is quick to take charge and work with others in order to make sure everyone is safe. For example, he and Ron save Cat Grant's life.<ref>"Action Comics" #866-870 (2008)</ref>

The 2009-2010 miniseries ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'' established that Lombard, in post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' continuity, was already on the staff of the ''Daily Planet'' when Clark Kent began working at the newspaper.<ref>''Superman: Secret Origin'' #3 (2009)</ref>

==Alternate versions==

===Earth-Two===
There was an [[Earth-Two]] version called Steve Bard who appeared in the 'Mr. & Mrs. Superman' stories in the '[[Superman Family]]' title. He appeared first in the 1940s, as a jokester, resembling The [[Prankster (comics)|Prankster]].

===''All-Star Superman''===
Steve Lombard appears as a minor supporting character in [[Grant Morrison]]'s limited series ''[[All-Star Superman]].''  This incarnation works as a sportswriter at the ''Daily Planet.''  His character and appearance are similar to that of the post-Crisis Lombard.  In ''All-Star Superman'' #7, Steve proves immune to the [[Bizarro]] virus due to his use of [[steroids|performance enhancing drugs]]. In the same issue, he risks his life to defend fellow employees from danger.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Grant Morrison | penciller = Frank Quitely | inker = Jamie Grant | story = Episode 7: Being Bizarro  | title = '''[[All-Star Superman]]''' | volume = | issue = 7| date = '''June 2007''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref> He also wears a toupee he denies exists.
