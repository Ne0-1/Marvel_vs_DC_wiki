'''Steve Lombard''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] character appearing in ''[[Superman]]'' comics.  He first appeared in ''Superman'' #264 (June 1973) in a story written by [[Elliot S. Maggin]] and penciled by [[Curt Swan]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]===
[[Image:Lombard.jpg|thumb|left|Steve Lombard's first appearance.  Art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In [[Pre-Crisis]] continuity, Steve "The Slinger" Lombard is a former [[quarterback]] for the fictional [[NFL]] team the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] Meteors.  Steve injures his knee while saving a baby falling from a building.  An experimental radiation treatment cures his knee injury, but also produces an energy being that resembles Lombard.  The energy being responds to Lombard's thoughts, and begins scoring touchdowns in his place.  At first taking credit for the energy being's performance, Lombard is forced to confess the truth after the energy being goes on a rampage and has to be stopped by Superman.  He is subsequently hired by [[Morgan Edge]] to become a sportscaster for Galaxy Broadcasting, working alongside anchor [[Clark Kent]] on the Six O'Clock News.<ref name="superman264">{{Cite comic | writer = Cary Bates | penciller = Curt Swan | inker = Murphy Anderson | story = Secret of the Phantom Quarterback! | title = '''Superman''' | volume = 1 | issue = 264 | date = '''June 1973''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref>.  

Steve is portrayed as brash and overly self confident, and often plays pranks on Clark Kent, which he is usually able to counter with the subtle usage of his powers (referring to him by the unflattering nickname "Clarkie"). However, Steve also considers Clark one of his few real friends, since he takes Steve's attitude in stride and never bears him a grudge. When Steve is tracked to Clark's apartment by a super-powered enemy (a former college roommate who did not shrug off Steve's pranks nearly as well as Clark does), Steve forces Clark to safety before confronting his opponent, although Clark, naturally, returns as Superman to rescue Steve.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Cary Bates | penciller = Curt Swan | inker = Dave Hunt | story = Steve Lombard -- Down, Out, and Dead? | title = '''Superman''' | volume = 1 | issue = 384 | date = '''June 1983''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref>.

===Post-Crisis===
Lombard was not part of the original reboot of the ''Superman'' storyline that began in [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel]]'' mini-series.  His first [[Post-Crisis]] appearance is as a news anchor on WGBS-TV in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #467 (June 1990). 

As of the [[June 2008]] storyline, Lombard works for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', as the editor of the Sports section<ref>

[[Perry White]] states Steve Lombard has recently returned to the paper, so it can be assumed that Steve used to work there before leaving to work for WGBS. ''Action Comics Annual'' #11 (May 2008) gives the following information on Steve: "''Sports Reporter. Steve Lombard played football in high school, college, and briefly for the pros. He sees himself as a man's man, everything Clark Kent is not in fact. He is a walking encyclopedia of sports trivia and put-downs. Lombard cannot figure out why [[Lois Lane]] does not throw herself at him.''" It is also stated that Steve Lombard often butts heads with [[Ron Troupe]] on nearly everything. He again exhibits the personality and the mannerism of a stereotypical [[jock (athlete)|jock]], brash, loud and overconfident, putting brawn over brains and constantly attempting rude advances to [[Cat Grant]] and Lois Lane, oblivious to the snappy remarks he gets back, and the clever ways Ron and Clark use to underline his brashness.

==Alternate versions==
===''All Star Superman''===
Steve Lombard appears as a minor supporting character in [[Grant Morrison]]'s limited series ''[[All Star Superman]].''  This incarnation works as a sportswriter at the ''Daily Planet.''  His character and appearance are similar to that of the post-Crisis Lombard.  In ''All-Star Superman'' #7, Steve proves immune to the [[Bizarro]] virus due to his use of [[steroids|performance enhancing drugs]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Grant Morrison | penciller = Frank Quitely | inker = Jamie Grant | story = Episode 7: Being Bizarro  | title = '''[[All Star Superman]]''' | volume = | issue = 7| date = '''June 2007''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref>.

===''The Batman''===
Though not appearing in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', Steve Lombard makes a cameo appearance in issue #44 of the spin-off comic ''The Batman Strikes!'' in the Daily Planet.

==Appearances in other media==
===''Smallville''===
The character of Steve Lombard was scheduled to appear in "Requiem," the fourteenth episode from ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'''s eighth season, and be played by actor [[Ray Galletti]]. Lombard's role was cut from the episode during its production, however, and Galletti was recast in a different role.
