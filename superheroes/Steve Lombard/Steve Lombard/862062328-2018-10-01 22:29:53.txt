'''Steve Lombard''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Steve Lombard first appeared in ''Superman'' #264 (June 1973) in a story written by [[Cary Bates]] and penciled by [[Curt Swan]]. When editor [[Julius Schwartz]] suggested adding a sportscaster to Clark Kent's news broadcast, Bates decided to create a workplace adversary for Kent to contrast with Kent's friendly relationship with the other cast members, drawing partial inspiration from the character [[Ted Baxter]] of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.<ref name="back91">{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=John |title=Bullies and Blowhards of the DC Bronze Age |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91|pages=16-18 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Lombard's physical model was real-life football star [[Joe Namath]].<ref name="back91"/>

For several years after Steve Lombard's debut, he appeared in nearly every published Superman story. ''[[Action Comics]]'' writer [[Martin Pasko]] later attempted to explain the character's popularity: {{quote|... Lombard is one of the few examples of a character that all of us Superman scripters at that time wrote in more or less the same way - as opposed to, say, the way [[Lana Lang]] seemed to be a totally different character when she'd show up in ''Action'' on occasion. I think that's because Lombard was one of the most sharply drawn and purposefully designed (though not particularly complex) characters I've ever handled - the most clearly communicated idea I've ever heard from an editor and the writer who co-created it: the jock doofus unwittingly trying to bust Superman's ''caj√≥nes''. The audience waits for it, knowing that a hotfoot with a match won't trump a hotfoot from heat vision, or whatever. And I gather the other Superman writers thought so, too. That's why Lombard became, for me, at least, one of the best examples of what, in [[sitcom]]s, we call the 'run-through character.' That's certainly what Ted Baxter was on TV: the character you knew you could 'run through' a scene and get laughs just from his showing up. ... The audience starts laughing when they show up because they're laughing at what they're imagining is gonna happen. They're 'waiting for it.'<ref name="back91"/>}}

Bates wrote Steve Lombard out of the regular Superman supporting cast in ''Superman'' #384, though his final pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] appearance was not until ''Superman'' #413.<ref name="back91"/>

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths===
[[Image:Steve Lombard's first appearance.jpg|thumb|left|Steve Lombard's first appearance.  Art by [[Curt Swan]]]]
In [[Pre-Crisis]] continuity, Steve "The Slinger" Lombard is a former [[quarterback]] for the fictional [[NFL]] team the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] Meteors.  Steve injures his knee while saving a baby falling from a building.  An experimental radiation treatment cures his knee injury, but also produces an energy being that resembles Lombard.  The energy being responds to Lombard's thoughts, and begins scoring touchdowns in his place.  At first taking credit for the energy being's performance, Lombard is forced to confess the truth after the energy being goes on a rampage and has to be stopped by Superman.  He is subsequently hired by [[Morgan Edge]] to become a sportscaster for Galaxy Broadcasting, working alongside anchor [[Clark Kent]] on the Six O'Clock News.<ref name="superman264">{{Cite comic | writer = Cary Bates | penciller = Curt Swan | inker = Murphy Anderson | story = Secret of the Phantom Quarterback! | title = '''Superman''' | volume = 1 | issue = 264 | date = '''June 1973''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref> <ref>''Action Comics'' #466 (December 1976)</ref>

Steve is portrayed as brash and overly self-confident, and often plays pranks on Clark Kent, which he is usually able to counter with the subtle usage of his powers (referring to him by the unflattering nickname "Clarkie"). However, Steve also considers Clark one of his few real friends, since he takes Steve's attitude in stride and never bears him a grudge. Steve has a brother who is a doctor named Vernon Lombard. Steve has a nephew named Jaime Lombard.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Elliot S!

===Post-Crisis===
Lombard was not part of the original reboot of the ''Superman'' storyline that began in [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'' mini-series.  His first [[Post-Crisis]] appearance is as a news anchor on WGBS-TV in ''The Adventures of Superman'' #467 (June 1990).

As of the June 2008 storyline, Lombard works for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', as the editor of the Sports section.<ref>
{{Cite comic | writer = Geoff Johns | penciller = Gary Frank | inker = Jonathan Sibal | story = Brainiac, Part 1: First Contact | title = '''[[Action Comics]]''' | volume = | issue = 866 | date = '''August 2008''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref> [[Perry White]] states Steve Lombard has recently returned to the paper, so it can be assumed that Steve used to work there before leaving to work for WGBS. ''Action Comics Annual'' #11 (May 2008) gives the following information on Steve: "''Sports Reporter. Steve Lombard played football in high school, college, and briefly for the pros. He sees himself as a man's man, everything Clark Kent is not in fact. He is a walking encyclopedia of sports trivia and put-downs. Lombard cannot figure out why [[Lois Lane]] does not throw herself at him.''" It is also stated that Steve Lombard often butts heads with [[Ron Troupe]] on nearly everything.

His personality is featured in the 2008 'Brainiac' storyline. He makes a crude sexual advance to Lois Lane right in front of Clark Kent. He insults Ron Troupe's choice of subject matter, thinking articles critical of sports means Ron 'hates' them. He takes great joy in assaulting colleagues with a football, laughing at their torment. However, once actual danger arises he is quick to take charge and work with others in order to make sure everyone is safe. For example, he and Ron save [[Cat Grant]]'s life.<ref>"Action Comics" #866-870 (2008)</ref>

The 2009-2010 miniseries ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'' established that Lombard, in post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' continuity, was already on the staff of the ''Daily Planet'' when Clark Kent began working at the newspaper.<ref>''Superman: Secret Origin'' #3 (2009)</ref>

Steve Lombard is shot in the shoulder when he attempts to stop a crazed gunman from killing various Daily Planet employees. He is later seen being led away from the building. <ref>''Action Comics'' #989 (2016)</ref>

==Alternate versions==

===Earth-Two===
There was an [[Earth-Two]] version called Steve Bard who appeared in the 'Mr. & Mrs. Superman' stories in the ''[[Superman Family]]'' title. He appeared first in ''Superman'' (first series) #29, as a jokester, resembling The [[Prankster (comics)|Prankster]].
===Smallville===
Steve Lombard is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].

===Earth-Three===
In the New 52 an alternate version of Steve Lombard was mentioned by Ultraman during his attack on the ''Daily Planet''. He tells Jimmy Olsen that the Earth-Three Jimmy Olsen had skinned Steve Lombard for looking at his private collection of pictures of Superwoman. This was the only reference so far to the character.<ref>Justice League # 20</ref>

===''All-Star Superman''===
Steve Lombard appears as a minor supporting character in [[Grant Morrison]]'s limited series ''[[All-Star Superman]].''  This incarnation works as a sportswriter at the ''Daily Planet.''  His character and appearance are similar to that of the post-Crisis Lombard.  In ''All-Star Superman'' #7, Steve proves immune to the [[Bizarro]] virus due to his use of [[steroids|performance-enhancing drugs]]. In the same issue, he risks his life to defend fellow employees from danger.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Grant Morrison | penciller = Frank Quitely | inker = Jamie Grant | story = Episode 7: Being Bizarro  | title = '''[[All-Star Superman]]''' | volume = | issue = 7| date = '''June 2007''' | publisher = '''DC Comics''' | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref> He also wears a toupee he denies exists.
