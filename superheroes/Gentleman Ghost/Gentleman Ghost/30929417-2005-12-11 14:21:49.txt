'''The Gentleman Ghost''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]].  He is a recurring nemesis of [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]].

==Background==
"Gentleman Jim" Craddock was a notorious [[highwayman]] and robber who terrorized [[England]] in the 1800s.  He journeyed to the [[United States]] and encountered the [[gunslinger]]s [[Hawkman|Nighthawk]] and [[Hawkgirl|Cinnamon]].  The hot-headed Nighthawk captured and ended Craddock's life with a [[noose]] and [[gallows]], but Craddock transcended death as a surprisingly cultured [[Ghost|phantom]].

The Gentleman Ghost learned he would wander the earth until the [[spirit]] of his killer moved on to the next [[plane (cosmology)|plane]] of existence.  Unfortunately for Craddock, Nighthawk and Cinnamon were the [[Reincarnation|reborn incarnations]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] royals Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara, and their [[soul]]s (due to their exposure to the [[Thanagar]]ian [[Nth Metal]]) could never truly pass on.  Both were eventually resurrected as [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], and the Gentleman Ghost became their recurring nemesis during the 1940s.  Craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes, including [[Max Mercury]] and the [[Star-Spangled Kid]] (Courtney Whitmore), but the vengeful Ghost always returns to clash with his main foes, the Hawks. Gentleman Ghost did clash with [[Batman]] on different occasions.

==Other Media==
Gentleman Ghost was seen in the [[Super Friends|All New Super Friends Hour]] episode titled "Ghost" where a man casts a spell to bring Gentleman Ghost to the living so that he can take revenge on [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] for imprisoning his spirit. He used his powers to turn U.N. representatives into ghosts and later turned Superman and Wonder Woman into ghosts, but the curse was eventually broken. After which, the Superfriends used the mystical Rods of [[Merlin]] to send Gentleman Ghost back to his grave, never to return.

The Gentleman Ghost is seen as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom]] shown on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.
