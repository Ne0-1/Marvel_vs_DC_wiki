'''The Gentleman Ghost''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[DC Comics]] publications. A recurring nemesis of [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], he first appeared during the late 1940s as the mysterious "Ghost" or "Gentlemen Ghost", seemingly manifesting astral abilities, although whether or not this was his true nature was left ambiguous. When he reappeared during the 1960s, he moved to Earth-One {{Fact|date=June 2007}} and gained new adversaries such as Batman.

==Fictional character history==

"Gentleman Jim" Craddock was the son of an English gentleman who abandoned both Jim and his mother, forcing them into poverty. Being poor made Craddock greedy and when he grew up he was a notorious [[highwayman]] and robber who terrorized [[England]] in the 1800s. He journeyed to the [[United States]] and encountered the [[gunslinger]]s [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]] and [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]]. The hot-headed Nighthawk captured and ended Craddock's life with a [[noose]] and [[gallows]], but Craddock transcended death as a surprisingly cultured [[Ghost|phantom]].

The Gentleman Ghost learned he would wander the earth until the [[spirit]] of his killer moved on to the next [[plane (cosmology)|plane of existence]]. Unfortunately for Craddock, Nighthawk and Cinnamon were the [[Reincarnation|reborn incarnations]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] royals Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara, and their [[soul]]s (due to their exposure to the [[Thanagar]]ian [[Nth Metal]]) could never truly pass on. Both were eventually resurrected as [[Carter Hall (comics)|Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], and the Gentleman Ghost became their recurring nemesis during the 1940s. Craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes, including [[Max Mercury]] and [[Stargirl]], but the vengeful Ghost always returns to his main foes, the Hawks, sometimes as a foe and sometimes as a friend. 

Gentleman Ghost did clash with [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] on different occasions. In ''JSA Classified'', issues 5-7, the Gentleman Ghost was a member of the [[Injustice Society]]. In ''[[Villains United]]'' #1, he joined the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His origin was explored and altered in the pages of ''JSA'' #82-87 (2006). Still, natural son of an abusive father and a poor mother, young Jim Craddock soon slipped into a life of crime, making contacts with the supernatural. After being prophesied by a [[Roma people|gypsy]] that he would be able to transcend death and return to life fighting and killing his enemies on English soil, his villainous career was put to an end when he was captured and sentenced to death. Returning as a ghost, he battles the JSA, hoping for the prophecy to come true.

After the events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the Ghost becomes involved in a fight with [[Alan Scott]]. This ends badly for Scott, leaving him a in coma. 

When the rightful time arrives the Ghost gains the additional power of summoning vengeful ghosts from his enemies' (the JSA) past. His plan is foiled by [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], surprisingly a descendant of the Royal House of England.

Involved with the fight [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]], and [[Stargirl]], who, as a [[virgin]] girl, was impervious to ghostly attacks. Finally vanquished, he apparently disappears for good.

==Powers==
Originally, the Gentleman Ghost relied on devices to simulate a ghostly existence. Later, however, he was [[retcon]]ned into a true ghost and his abilities altered to follow suit. As a ghost, Craddock had several abilities. He could become intangible and pass effortlessly through solid material. He could become completely invisible. In fact, the appearance of his head as a floating hat and monocle is actually him rendering his decayed face invisible. He has been shown as being able to teleport as short a distance as a few rooms or as far as across states. Gentleman Ghost can also summon spectral weapons including a cane that shoots fire and flintlock pistols. When passing through Craddock's ghostly form, people will sometimes experience an intense feeling of cold. Since this does not happen every time, it would seem that he can control this effect. Craddock can apparently track psionic energy and travel across dimensions as he did when he followed an astral tether from the Wizard to Johnny Sorrow. Around the time of his prophesied return to life, he gained the power to summon and control the spirits of the dead due to his mother's spirit spending centuries recruiting them to help her son. It is unknown if he can still call upon them.

The Gentleman Ghost is apparently unable to touch or be touched by [[virgins]]. This is confirmed by his inability to do harm to both [[Stargirl]] and [[Jakeem Thunder]]. However, he could pick up a real weapon and be able to hurt them as when he brandished the [[Cosmic Rod]].

As a supernatural being, Gentleman Ghost cannot be killed and is very hard to hurt, however those with royal blood can physically harm him and energy hitting him unawares causes pain.

==Other media==
Gentleman Ghost was seen in the ''[[Super Friends|All New Super Friends Hour]]'' episode titled "Ghost" where a man casts a spell to bring Gentleman Ghost to the living so that he can take revenge on [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] for imprisoning his spirit. He used his powers to turn U.N. representatives into ghosts and later turned Superman and Wonder Woman into ghosts, but the curse was eventually broken. After which, the Superfriends used the mystical Rods of [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] to send Gentleman Ghost back to his grave, never to return.  He is referred to only as "Gentleman Jim Craddock" in the episode, not as "Gentleman Ghost."

The Gentleman Ghost is seen as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] shown on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In one particular appearance that showcased him trying to outrun the [[Green Lantern]] until Hawkman caught him with a net made from Nth Metal. He is voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]].

''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' created a skit starring [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Alec Baldwin]], in which Alec Baldwin's character is a bum named the Gentleman Ghost for his tendencies to "get it on with dead dudes." This skit is alluded to in the song ''Piss Shoes'' by The Wolf Pack.
