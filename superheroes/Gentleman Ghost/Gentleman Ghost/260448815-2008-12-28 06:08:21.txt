'''Gentleman Ghost''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[DC Comics]] publications. A recurring nemesis of [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], he first appeared during the late 1940s as the mysterious "Ghost" or "Gentlemen Ghost", seemingly manifesting astral abilities, although whether or not this was his true nature was left ambiguous.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Gentleman Ghost | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 137 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional character history==
"Gentleman Jim" Craddock was the son of an English gentleman who abandoned both Jim and his mother, forcing them into poverty. Craddock grew up to become a notorious [[highwayman]] and robber who terrorized [[England]] in the 1800s. He journeyed to the [[United States]] and encountered the [[gunslinger]]s [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]] and [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]]. The hot-headed Nighthawk lynched Craddock after wrongly assuming that he was sexually assaulting Cinnamon, but Craddock somehow eluded death to rise again as a  [[Ghost|phantom]].

The Gentleman Ghost learned he would wander the earth until the [[spirit]] of his killer moved on to the next [[plane (metaphysics)|plane of existence]]. Unfortunately, Nighthawk and Cinnamon turned out to be the [[reincarnation]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian royalty Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara: their [[soul]]s (due to their exposure to the [[Thanagar]]ian [[Nth metal]]) could never truly pass on.  Both were eventually resurrected as [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]], and the Gentleman Ghost became their recurring nemesis during the 1940s.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes, including [[Max Mercury]] and [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]], but the vengeful Ghost always returns to his main foes, the Hawks, sometimes as a foe and sometimes as a friend. 

Gentleman Ghost did clash with [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] on different occasions. In ''JSA Classified'', issues 5-7, the Gentleman Ghost was a member of the [[Injustice Society]]. In ''[[Villains United]]'' #1, he joined the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His origin was explored and altered in the pages of ''JSA'' #82-87 (2006). Still, natural son of an abusive father and a poor mother, young Jim Craddock soon slipped into a life of crime, making contacts with the supernatural. After being prophesied by a [[Roma people|gypsy]] that he would be able to transcend death and return to life fighting and killing his enemies on English soil, his villainous career was put to an end when he was captured and sentenced to death. Returning as a ghost, he battles the JSA, hoping for the prophecy to come true.

The Ghost is briefly seen in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', during the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]] attack on Metropolis and it's dozens of superpowered defenders. Afterwards, the Ghost becomes involved in a fight with [[Alan Scott]]. This ends badly for Scott, leaving him a in coma. 

When the rightful time arrives, the Ghost gains the additional power of summoning vengeful ghosts from his enemies' (the JSA) past. His plan is foiled by [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]], who, as a [[virginity|virgin]] girl, was impervious to ghostly attacks, and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], surprisingly a descendant of the Royal House of England. Finally vanquished, he apparently disappears for good.

==Powers==
Originally, the Gentleman Ghost relied on devices to simulate a ghostly existence. Later, however, he was [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned into a true ghost and his abilities altered to follow suit. As a ghost, Craddock had several abilities. He could become intangible and pass effortlessly through solid material. He could become completely invisible. In fact, the appearance of his head as a floating hat and monocle is actually him rendering his decayed face invisible. He has been shown as being able to teleport as short a distance as a few rooms or as far as across states. Gentleman Ghost can also summon spectral weapons including a cane that shoots fire and flintlock pistols. When passing through Craddock's ghostly form, people will sometimes experience an intense feeling of cold. Since this does not happen every time, it would seem that he can control this effect. Craddock can apparently track psionic energy and travel across dimensions as he did when he followed an astral tether from the Wizard to Johnny Sorrow. Around the time of his prophesied return to life, he gained the power to summon and control the spirits of the dead due to his mother's spirit spending centuries recruiting them to help her son. It is unknown if he can still call upon them.

The Gentleman Ghost is apparently unable to touch or be touched by virgins. This is confirmed by his inability to do harm to both [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]] and [[Jakeem Thunder]]. However, he could pick up a real weapon and be able to hurt them as when he brandished the Cosmic Rod.

As a supernatural being, Gentleman Ghost cannot be killed and is very hard to hurt. However, those with royal blood can physically harm him and when unaware, energy hitting him causes pain.

==Other Media==
===Television===
* Gentleman Ghost was seen in the ''[[Super Friends|All New Super Friends Hour]]'' episode titled "Ghost" where a man casts a spell to bring Gentleman Ghost to the living so that he can take revenge on [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] for imprisoning his spirit.
