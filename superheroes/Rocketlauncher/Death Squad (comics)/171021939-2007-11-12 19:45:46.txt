The '''Death Squad''' are a fictional team of technology-based [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Iron Man]]''. They first appeared in ''Iron Man'' volume 3 #1.

==History==

The origins of the Death Squad or its members are yet to be revealed. They were hired by a mysterious employer who wanted Tony Stark, the armored Avenger known as [[Iron Man]], dead. They managed to track Iron Man down at his main office, and a battle began. Though they gave Stark a good run for his money, they weren't able to defeat the super-hero. After Stark was about to win the battle, the Death Squad managed to escape, but only because Stark couldn't follow them due to the damage inflicted on his jet-boots by the Squad.

Later, the Death Squad decided to give the murder attempt another try. They assisted their employer in the murder of several ionically-powered beings and in the grave-robbing of several of Stark's old acquaintances. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] leader [[Nick Fury]] informed Stark about this and he investigated the matter, with the trail eventually leading toward the Death Squad, who were hiding out at the old castle of the ionically-powered villain [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria was revealed to be their employer, and although Iron Man managed to defeat Nefaria and his other minion, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], the Death Squad managed to escape in the heat of the battle.
