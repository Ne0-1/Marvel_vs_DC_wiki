The '''Death Squad''' is a fictional team of technology-based [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Iron Man]]''. They first appeared in ''Iron Man'' volume 3 #1.

==History==
The origins of the Death Squad or its members are yet to be revealed. They are hired by a mysterious employer who wants Tony Stark, the armored Avenger known as [[Iron Man]], dead. They manage to track Iron Man down at his main office, and a battle began. Though they gave Stark a good run for his money, they weren't able to defeat the super-hero. Stark is about to defeat the entire group but they manage an escape. Stark is unable to give pursuit as the Death Squad had damaged his armor's boot jets.

===Another try at murder===
Later, the Death Squad decide to give the murder attempt another try. They assist their employer (Justin Hammer) in the murder of several ionically-powered beings and in the grave-robbing of several of Stark's old acquaintances. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] leader [[Nick Fury]] informs Stark about this and he investigates the matter, with the trail eventually leading toward the Death Squad, who were hiding out at the old castle of the ionically-powered, long-time Avengers foe [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria is revealed to be their employer. Iron Man manages to defeat Nefaria and his other minion, [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]. In the heat of battle, the Death Squad again manages to escape.

==Black Lama's Death Squad==
The supervillains [[Melter]], [[Blacklash|Whiplash]], and [[Man-Bull]] are recruited by other-dimensional villain, the '''[[Black Lama]]''', to form the team the Death Squad to vie for the Golden Globe of Power. They fought Iron Man at a convention, but were decisively defeated.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #72</ref>
