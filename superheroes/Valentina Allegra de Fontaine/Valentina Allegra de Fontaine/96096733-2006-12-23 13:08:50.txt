==Publication history==

The Contessa appeared promiently throughout the Steranko run of the "Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D." feature that ran through ''Strange Tales'' #168 (May 1968) and in the same-name comic-book series that began the following month.

An agent who literally threw S.H.I.E.L.D. chief [[Nick Fury]] for a loop upon their initial meeting, she quickly became his love interest, and was featured in a silent, one-page seduction sequence in ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #2 that famously had two panels changed, at the behest of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. In the third-to-last panel, de facto Marvel [[art director]] [[John Romita Sr.]] redrew a telephone that had been taken off the hook for privacy, placing the receiver back in the cradle; in the last panel, an image was removed and replaced with a closeup of an item from earlier in the page — a phallic long-barreled gun in a holster.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/jonhulkholt/rs91.facefront.1.htm Green, Robin. "Face Front! Clap Your Hands, You're on the Winning Team!" ''Rolling Stone'' Vol. 1, #91 (Sept. 16, 1971)]:
{{cquote|So one panel had the stereo in Fury's apartment to show there was music playing, cigarettes in the ash tray in one, there was a sequence of intercut shots where she moved closer to him, much more intimately, there was a kiss, there was a rose, and then there was one panel with the telephone off the hook, which the comic book code <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]; "Comics Code"<nowiki>]</nowiki> made him put back on. ... [T]he last panel on that page had Nick and his old lady kneeling, with their arms around each other, and that was entirely too much for the Code, so the panel was replaced with a picture of a gun its holster.}}

The story was reprinted as published in ''Nick Fury Special Edition'' #1 (Dec. 1983). When reprinted again, in ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?'' (Marvel Enterprises, 2001; ISBN 978-0-7851-0766-8), however, Steranko's original final panel was reinserted. In a black-and-white long shot with [[screentone]] shading, the couple is beginning to embrace, with Fury standing and the Contessa on one knee, getting up.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
[[Contessa]] Valentina Allegra di Fontaine was a member of the European [[jet set]] and a citizen of [[Italy]].  After both her parents were killed for aiding some unspecified resistance movement, the Contessa found her life meaningless. Desiring to carry on in their places so their deaths would not be in vain, she eventually was contacted by the international espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and entered a training program to become an agent.<!--background her  ''Strange Tales'' #162, "So Evil, the Night'' p.3, panel 6-->

She first encountered its executive directory, Nick Fury, aboard S.H.I.E.L.D.'s airborne headquarters, the [[Helicarrier]], toward the end of her training, impressing Fury by tossing him head-over-heels with a [[judo]] throw after his uttering an untoward remark about female agents. The two eventually became lovers, and their relationship continued for many years.

As a result of the Contessa's remarkable talents and skills in many areas, she quickly became a leading member of S.H.I.E.L.D.  She was also at one point appointed as the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Femme Force.

==Quotes==
'''Steven Ringgenberg''': "Steeped in cinematic techniques picked up from that medium's masters, Jim [Steranko] synthesized a style he christened 'Zap Art' — an approach different from anything being done in mainstream comics, though it did include one standard attraction: lots of females in skintight, sexy costumes. Countess Valentina (Val) Allegro De Fontaine ([[sic]]) made her debut in ''Strange Tales'' #159 (Aug. 1967) by flooring Nick Fury during a training session, proving that she could take care of herself! She looked like a character who had just stepped out of a [[James Bond]] poster".<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Nebula/8650/bettypages.html ''Betty Pages Magazine'' #4 (Spring 1989)]</ref>
