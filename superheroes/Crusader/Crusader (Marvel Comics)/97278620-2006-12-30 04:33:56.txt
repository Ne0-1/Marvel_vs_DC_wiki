The first Crusader first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' (1st series) #330 (April, 1983). He was created by writer [[Alan Zelenetz]] and penciler [[Bob Hall]].

=== History ===

Arthur Blackwood was born in [[Decatur, Illinois]].  He was a seminary student in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] who believed that the [[Roman Catholic Church|church]] should become more active in fighting [[paganism]] and godlessness in modern society. Dismissed from the seminary for getting into an altercation with a superior, Blackwood visited his family crypt to meditate on his life. There he had a religious vision of all of his ancestors who devoted their lives to serving God. In this vision he met the spirit of one of his ancestors who served in the [[Crusades]]. This spirit seemingly bequeathed to him the combined power of all his ancestors and dubbed him knight. When Blackwood awoke from this vision, he discovered a [[sword]], [[shield]], and knight's [[wikt:Raiment|raiment]] had inexplicably materialized nearby. Blackwood decided to take up the sword and use his newfound power to destroy all pagans and infidels. As his first target, he chose the thunder god Thor, whose claims of godhood seemed blasphemous to him.

Calling himself the Crusader, Blackwood attacked Thor at a public assembly. Somehow the strength of his faith granted him sufficient power not only to hold his own in pitched battle with the Asgardian, but also to inflict upon Thor a seemingly mortal wound. When Thor reappeared a short time later, his wound fully healed by the power of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], the Crusader's belief in his own infallibility was shaken. The Crusader was unable to comprehend how a supposed agent of the devil like Thor could be superior to him, a self-styled messenger of the Lord. When Thor shattered his sword, the Crusader fled, filled with doubts about the righteousness of his cause. 

Blackwood's doubt has often caused him to lose battles rather than win them. [[Luke Cage]] has also able to defeat Blackwood after breaking his sword and once again causing Blackwood to doubt his cause leading, in turn, to yet another defeat. His doubt also led him to defeat at the hands of Nate Grey, aka [[X-Man]]. After this, Blackwood seemingly disappeared from continuing his crusade.

Not too long after the disassembly of the Avenger, [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] conducted the breakout of many famous Marvel villains from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], a prison island for super villains. Blackwood was held as a prisoner here but would soon escape along with many other prisoners. This escape once again inspired Blackwood to continue his crusade, starting with [[Doctor Strange]]. However, his newest crusade would also be last as Strange would use his powers to send Blackwood back to the Raft.

==== Civil War ====
{{spoiler}}
In [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (3rd series) #42 (July, 2006), it was revealed that the Crusader was apparently still active and had organized a religious group of thugs for himself. Hijacking a plane filled with money and planning to bomb the headquarters of several super-heroes, the Crusader and his men got stopped by Wolverine when he gained word about their operation. However, Wolverine was unable to prevent the plane from crashing down into a cornfield, and on impact the plane exploded. It is unclear if the Crusader is dead now. While he lacked the healing factor that allowed Wolverine to survive the crash, it is possible that Crusader's superhuman durability could have saved him.

=== Abilities ===

The Crusader's physical attributes, as well as the power of his sword and shield, are directly related to his will and belief; while he is confident, his strength, speed, stamina, agility, reaction time, and resistance to injury are sufficient for him to stand toe to toe with the likes of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. However, if his faith wavers, his superhuman powers will rapidly disappear. While he has instantly summoned his armor and weaponry, this does not see to be under Blackwood's conscious control.

Shortly after the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[Avengers Disassembled|disbanded]], a [[Skrull]] operative sent to spy on the Avengers decides to become a superhero himself, and calls himself the Crusader (a name he chose specifically because it gives no clue as to his abilities). He soon becomes the mentor of [[Freedom Ring]]. This new Crusader has no known connection to Arthur Blackwood. After Freedom Ring is killed by [[Iron Maniac]], Crusader takes the boy's reality-altering ring for himself. Rather than using the ring to continue his superhero career, Crusader seems to have retired to a life of leisure, using it to create fake Skrull women. However, when [[Titannus]] attacked the [[USA]], Crusader helped other superheroes to defeat the monster.
