Lady Blackhawk is the popular alias of two fiction female aviatrix/soldiers who have appeared over the decades in assorted [[Quality Comics]] and later [[DC Comics]] publications. The two characters are presented here in the order in which their fictional adventures were initially published.

==Zinda Blake, Lady Blackhawk I==

Zinda Blake, the first '''Lady Blackhawk''', is a fictional [[DC Comics]] character (originally a [[Quality Comics]] character).

She was introduced in the [[February]], [[1959]] issue of the [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk]]s comic book (#133) and wanted to become part of the team.  For a while she was influenced by [[Killer Shark]], one of the main Blackhawks villains, and became Queen Killer Shark.

As a side-effect of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] she is now in present-time DC continuity, where she became a supporting character first of [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner, Warrior]], and later (as of late [[2004]]) of [[Birds of Prey]], where she is the team's pilot and looks about fifty years younger than she really is. Zinda enjoys cooking and dancing when she's not out flying planes and fighting evil. Her favorite recipe is chicken a la king. Zinda is credited for officially naming Oracle's team "The Birds of Prey."

==Natalie Reed, Lady Blackhawk II==

Natalie Reed, the second woman to be known as '''Lady Blackhawk''', was introduced in the mini-series ''Blackhawk: Blood and Iron'' written and drawn by [[Howard Chaykin]] and published by DC in [[1987]].

Retroactively established as having been part of the [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk Squadron]] at the behest of the [[Soviet Union]] from [[1943]] onwards. Her history with the Blackhawks was a chaotic one, and endured through the end of the [[Second World War]] and much of the [[Cold War]] that followed.
