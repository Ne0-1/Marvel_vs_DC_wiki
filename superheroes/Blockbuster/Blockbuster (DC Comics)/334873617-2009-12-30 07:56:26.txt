'''Blockbuster''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. The first one was primarily a foe of [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], while the second frequently fought [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], formerly Robin.  The latest Blockbuster first appeared in the pages of the series [[52 (comic book)|52]] wherein he is directed into battle against [[Lex Luthor]]'s team of superheroes, [[Infinity, Inc.|Infinity Inc]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Mark Desmond===
The first Blockbuster was '''Mark Desmond''', a [[chemist]] who desired to increase his physical strength.  Experimenting on himself, he succeeded in making himself stronger and taller, but as a side-effect of the process he also became almost mindlessly aggressive.  The mentally debilitated Desmond was cared for by his brother Roland, a local criminal, who kept their mother from discovering what Mark had done to himself.<ref name="dc-ency1">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = | contribution = Blockbuster I | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 56  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Roland manipulated his brother into committing crimes on his behalf until they came into conflict with Batman and Robin.  Bruce Wayne had once rescued a young Desmond from drowning, and he discovered that he could calm the enraged adult Desmond by removing his cowl, showing him his face. Desmond later found himself clashing with Batman on various occasions.  He joined the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] briefly for a battle with the [[Justice League]].  Later, [[Amanda Waller]] recruited Desmond for her revived [[Suicide Squad]].  He was killed fighting [[Darkseid]]'s creation [[Brimstone (comics)|Brimstone]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[John Ostrander|Ostrander, John]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]] | Story = Send For... the Suicide Squad! | Title = [[Legends (comics)|Legends]] | Volume =  | Issue = 3 | Date = January, 1987 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 14 | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

'''Roland Desmond''' became the second Blockbuster after a severe illness forced him to be treated with experimental steroids. Like his brother Mark, Roland became a child-minded super-strong monster.  He ran wild in the Southwest, but [[Batman]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] brought his rampage to an end.<ref>''Starman  #10''</ref><ref name="dc-ency2">{{Citation  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Blockbuster II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 55  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

Desmond became obsessed with elevating himself greatly above his debilitated intellect.  A pact with the demon [[Neron]] granted him a genius-level intellect, and Desmond embarked once more on a career of crime and destruction.  He began his revived criminal career by causing chaos in the town of Manchester, although his schemes were foiled by the speedster [[Bart Allen|Impulse]].

Desmond then moved to his mother's home town of [[Blüdhaven]].  He forced the crime lord Angel Marin out of power and took over the city's criminal rackets.  Roland's plan was to build a criminal empire in the 'Haven, that would eventually enable him to extend his dominion over [[Gotham City|Gotham]], [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and [[New York]]'s underworlds. For that purpose, he bought the corrupt elements of the city's Police Department, most notably the Police Chief Redhorn and Inspector [[Torque (DC Comics)|Dudley "Deadly" Soames]].

Despite his swift and vicious consolidation of power, Blockbuster's hold on Blüdhaven's organized crime was nevertheless weakened by the intervention of the city's new protector: [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (Dick Grayson, the former [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]), who, with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s help, foiled Desmond's plans at every turn.

Desmond's primary goal became the elimination of the young vigilante. He placed a contract on Nightwing's life, employing the services of several assassins, including [[Lady Vic]], Stallion, Brutale, the [[Trigger Twins]], and [[Shrike (comics)#Boone|Shrike]].

====Death of Blockbuster====
As a further result of his initial transformation, Desmond later developed [[albinism]] and a [[congenital heart defect|heart defect]].  He was restored to (comparative) health by a heart transplant from one of the talking apes of [[Gorilla City]], and was consolidating his control over Blüdhaven and contemplating a takeover of [[Gotham City]], when he was killed by the new [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Catalina Flores|Tarantula]], Catalina Flores.<ref>[[DCDatabase:Nightwing Vol 2 93|''Nightwing'' (Volume 2) #93]] (July, 2004)</ref>

====Blackest Night====
As part of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Roland's corpse is reanimated by a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] and recruited to the [[Black Lantern Corps]] in ''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (October 2009).

===The New Blockbuster===
[[Lex Luthor]] created a new Blockbuster in the pages of the miniseries event ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' to serve as an opponent of his manufactured hero team, [[Infinity, Inc.|Infinity Inc]].

Little is revealed about this Blockbuster, save for the fact that Luthor possesses some measure of control of his actions and level of strength. Luthor also comments that he is stronger than either of the two previous Blockbusters. This brute's cognitive abilities and appearance are very similar to the original. Blockbuster, with controlled interference from [[Lex Luthor]], kills the superhero Trajectory. 

A Blockbuster appears amongst the villains exiled to an alien world in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. In issue #3 it is revealed to be a disguised [[Martian Manhunter]].

===Female Blockbuster===
A newer, female Blockbuster appears in the swamps of Louisiana and fights [[Mon-El]] in ''Superman'' #689 (2009).

==Powers and abilities==
All Blockbusters have super human strength, agility, and endurance. They have a high degree of resistance to physical and energy attacks.

After selling his soul to Neron, Roland Desmond gained super intelligence.
