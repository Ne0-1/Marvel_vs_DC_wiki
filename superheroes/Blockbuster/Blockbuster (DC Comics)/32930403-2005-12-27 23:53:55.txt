'''Blockbuster''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[DC Comics]].  The first one was primarily a foe of [[Batman]] and [[Robin]], while the second frequently fought [[Nightwing#Richard John .22Dick.22 Grayson|Nightwing]].

==Background==
The first Blockbuster was Mark Desmond, a [[chemist]] who wanted to become [[Physical strength|stronger]].  Experimenting on himself, he grew stronger and taller, but in the process was turned into a mindless brute.  Desmond was cared for by his criminally-minded brother, Roland, who shielded Mark's monstrous appearance from their mother.

Roland used Mark to commit crimes until they were stopped by [[Batman]] and [[Robin]].  Desmond had years earlier been rescued from drowning by Bruce Wayne, and the Dark Knight Detective discovered that he could calm and stall the behemoth by removing his cowl and revealing his face.  The sight did indeed calm the giant, preventing further destruction.  Blockbuster sought solitude when free, only to find himself opposing the Caped Crusader on various occasions.  He was recruited by [[Amanda Waller]]'s new [[Suicide Squad]], and died battling [[Darkseid]]'s creation [[Brimstone (comics)|Brimstone]].

After the gene bomb detonation during the alien ''Invasion!'', Mark's brother Roland found he was now a child-minded super-strong behemoth.  He went on a rampage, but Batman and [[Starman]] ensured that he wound up behind bars.

Acquiring a genius-level [[Intelligence (trait)|intellect]] became Desmond's obsession, and the demon [[Neron]] made it a reality.  Selling his soul to the demon, he obtained awesome acumen that matched his phenomenal physical power.  Setting up shop in his mother's home of [[Blüdhaven]], Desmond forced out crimelord Angel Marin and took over the criminal organizations there.  Blüdhaven's protector [[Nightwing#Richard John .22Dick.22 Grayson|Nightwing]], and the all-knowing [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] frequently irritated the new Blockbuster.  He took out his frustrations by snapping his underling's [[neck]]s, creating the villain [[Torque (comics)|Torque]] when one victim inexplicably survived.

Desmond later developed [[albinism]] and his [[heart]] began to give out: side-effects of his gene bomb-derived powers.  He received a heart transplant from one of [[Gorilla City]]'s talking apes, and was tightening his grip over Blüdhaven and contemplating a takeover of [[Gotham City]] when he was shot and killed by [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].

==Other Media==
Blockbuster was first seen in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode called "Kid's Stuff" where he, [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] and [[KGBeast]] were robbing a gold vault. He was portrayed by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. Blockbuster is also a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in the series.

Mark Desmond has appeared on ''[[The Batman]]'' and was suspected of being absorbed into that series as part of the [[Bat-Embargo]], however his inclusion in the Legion of Doom has scuttled this.
