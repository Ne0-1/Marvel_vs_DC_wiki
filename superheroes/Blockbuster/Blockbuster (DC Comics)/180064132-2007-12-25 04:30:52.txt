'''Blockbuster''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. The first one was primarily a foe of [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], while the second frequently fought [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]].  The latest Blockbuster first appeared in the pages of the series [[52 (comic book)|52]] wherein he is directed into battle against [[Lex Luthor]]'s team of superheroes, [[Infinity, Inc.|Infinity Inc]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Mark Desmond===
The first Blockbuster was '''Mark Desmond''', a [[chemist]] who wanted to become [[Physical strength|stronger]]. Experimenting on himself, he grew stronger and taller, but in the process was turned into a mindless brute. Desmond was cared for by his criminally-minded brother, Roland, who shielded Mark's monstrous appearance from their mother.

Roland used Mark to commit crimes until they were stopped by Batman and Robin. Desmond had years earlier been rescued from drowning by Bruce Wayne, and the Dark Knight Detective discovered that he could calm and stall the behemoth by removing his cowl and revealing his face. The sight did indeed calm the giant, preventing further destruction. Blockbuster sought solitude when free, only to find himself opposing the Caped Crusader on various occasions. He served as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] during a battle with the [[Justice League]]. He was recruited by [[Amanda Waller]]'s new [[Suicide Squad]], and died battling [[Darkseid]]'s creation [[Brimstone (comics)|Brimstone]].

'''Roland Desmond''' became the second Blockbuster after a debilitating [[illness|malady]] forced him to be treated with experimental steroids. Like his brother Mark, Roland found he was now a child-minded super-strong behemoth. He went on a rampage in the Southwest, strong enough to give Starman V trouble, but [[Batman]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] together ensured that he wound up behind bars (''Starman  #10'')

Acquiring a genius-level [[Intelligence|intellect]] became Desmond's obsession, and the demon [[Neron]] made it a reality. Selling his soul to the demon, he obtained awesome acumen that matched his phenomenal physical power. 

He began his revived criminal career by causing chaos in the town of Manchester. He and his men cause a falling, flaming blimp to drop on a local stadium but the local hero, Impulse, is there to open the gates his men had locked. Blockbuster decides to simply take an armed team into downtown and murder everyone in sight. A man crashes into Blockbuster. The villain simply picks him up and snaps his neck. Impulse arrives again, to stop further loss of life. Blockbuster retreats to his sanctuary.

There was an irony to his deal with Neron that he would later reveal to the young hero Impulse during their final showdown.  As an unintelligent brute, he had only the dimmest understanding of what he wanted, and had wished for intelligence.  Once that had been granted, however, he realized that what he had truly desired was simply to be normal.

The fight with Impulse destroys the sanctuary he had built, which he had valued as a place where he could feel in control. Blockbuster escapes the destruction before he could be apprehended.

Still the same ambitious criminal of before, Desmond set up shop in his mother's home of [[Blüdhaven]], a city bereft of heroes. He forced out crimelord Angel Marin and took over the criminal organizations there. Roland's plan was to build a criminal empire in the 'Haven, that would eventually enable him to extend his dominion over [[Gotham City|Gotham]], [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and [[New York]]'s underworlds. For that purpose, he bought the corrupt elements of the city's Police Department, most notably the Police Chief Redhorn and Inspector [[Torque (comics)|Dudley "Deadly" Soames]].

Despite his swift and vicious consolidation of power, Blockbuster's hold on Blüdhaven's organized crime was nevertheless weakened by the intervention of the city's new protector: [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (Dick Grayson, the former [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]), who, with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'s help, fouled Desmond's plans at every turn.

Thus, the kingpin's primary goal became the elimination of the young vigilante in order to insure the longevity of his criminal cartel. Not only placing a sizable contract on Nightwing's head, Blockbuster also employed the services of several assassins, including [[Lady Vic]], Stallion, Brutale, the [[Trigger Twins]], and [[Shrike (comics)#Boone|Shrike]]. However, Desmond's attempts and resources failed to stop the hero.

====Death of Blockbuster====
Desmond later developed [[albinism]] and [[congenital heart defect|heart defect]]: side-effects of his transformation. He received a heart transplant from one of Gorilla City's talking apes, and was tightening his grip over Blüdhaven and contemplating a takeover of [[Gotham City]].

However, this changed with the death of his beloved mother. Blockbuster wrongfully blamed Nightwing, and started a vengeance campaign against the vigilante. Now knowing his secret identity, the criminal kingpin bombed Dick Grayson's apartment complex, killing most of its residents.  Still shocked, Nightwing enlisted the help of Blüdhaven's newest vigilante: the amoral female [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Catalina Flores|Tarantula]], Catalina Flores.  

Blockbuster had beaten down Grayson both physically and emotionally. When an exhausted Nightwing confronted Blockbuster, he was at his lowest ebb, but still managed to champion the battle.  During the fight and for a short time after its end, Blockbuster threatened Dick with killing all the people that he cared about, even the strangers who approached him in the street.  The timely arrival of Tarantula would end it all, however; she shot Blockbuster dead at point blank range as Nightwing didn't want to stop her when he could.  Suffering a [[panic attack]], Dick fled to the rooftop, where he broke down, begging for Bruce's forgiveness. Nightwing's inaction has became a source of tremendous guilt for the young hero. Nonetheless, Blockbuster's demise ended his stranglehold over Blüdhaven once and for all.

===The New Blockbuster===
[[Lex Luthor]] created a new Blockbuster in the pages of the miniseries event ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' to serve as an opponent of his manufactured hero team, [[Infinity, Inc.|Infinity Inc]].

Little is revealed about this Blockbuster, save for the fact that Luthor possesses some measure of control of his actions and level of strength. Luthor also comments that he is stronger than either of the two previous Blockbusters. This brute's cognitive abilities and appearance are very similar to the original. Blockbuster, with controlled interference from [[Lex Luthor]], kills the superhero Trajectory. Blockbuster III was among the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.

==In other media==
Blockbuster (Mark Desmond) was first seen in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Kid's Stuff" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. He, [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[KGBeast]] were robbing a gold vault. Blockbuster was also a member of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] in the series. However, after siding against [[Lex Luthor]] during the mutiny in favor of [[Gorilla Grodd]], he was frozen by [[Killer Frost]] and blown up by [[Darkseid]], along with the other mutineers.

Mark Desmond has also appeared on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', and was suspected of being absorbed into that series as part of the so-called Bat-Embargo; however, his inclusion in the Legion of Doom has scuttled this.
