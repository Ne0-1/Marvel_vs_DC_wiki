'''Blockbuster (Michael Baer)''' is a fictional [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Michael Golden]]. His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #210''.

== Fictional character History ==

'''Blockbuster''' is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a team of superhuman assassins brought together by the mutant thief [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] when he was in the employ of the enigmatic [[Mister Sinister]]. On Sinister's orders, the Marauders massacred the underground community of mutants known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. In the course of the massacre, the Marauders, including Blockbuster, clashed with various superhuman champions, including the superhuman mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]].

The norse god [[Thor]], summoned to the Morlock tunnels by his ally, the frog Puddleglup, happened upon Blockbuster following his torture of the mutant [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]].  Thor killed Blockbuster in retribution of the innocent Morlocks he has slain, and then burned his remains, along with those of the slaughtered Morlocks.

Sinister used his technology to clone the Marauders.  Blockbuster and other previously-slain Marauders returned during the demonic invasion of Manhattan referred to as the [[Inferno (comics)|Inferno]].  Blockbuster was among the Marauders set by Sinister to defend his orphanage/laboratory headquarters.  Blockbuster was slain by the mutant [[Havok]], who had, along with most of the X-men, been tainted by the demonic invasion, becoming more bestial and aggressive.

The X-Men discovered and deactivated many of Sinister's Clone Vaults after the events of the crossover saga [[X-ecutioner's Song]].  It is possible that Blockbuster or any other Maurauder, would be unable to be regrown following such efforts.

==Powers==
Blockbuster has an enormous physical mass grants him superhuman strength, endurance and durability. He was even able to trade punches with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].
