'''Starr the Slayer''' is a [[fictional character]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Chamber of Darkness]]'' #4, (April 1970), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. In 2007, writer [[Warren Ellis]] introduced a new version of Starr in the Marvel series [[newuniversal]]. 

==Publication history==
===Chamber of Darkness===
{{main|Chamber of Darkness}}
The initial version of Starr was a [[barbarian]] king, defending his kingdom. A 20th century writer, Len Carson, dreamed of Starr's adventures. When he was about to turn in a manuscript that would kill off Starr, Starr mysteriously appeared, killing Carson. It is unclear whether or not Starr was intended to be part of the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/starrslayer.htm marvunapp.com</ref>

===newuniversal===
{{main|newuniversal}}
[[Warren Ellis]]'s ''newuniversal'' series includes another version of Starr. In the universe of ''newuniversal'', some areas of space are part of an artifical construct, the 'newuniversal structure', and do not entirely obey the standard laws of physics. Earth has drifted into this structure on several occasions, and was within it for at least part of Starr's lifetime.

When a world first moves into the newuniversal structure, a small number of inhabitants are modified in predetermined ways, endowed with abilities that will help their people to cope with these changes. The ''newuniversal'' version of Starr was one such superhuman, gifted with the [[Starbrand]], which has been described as a planetary defense system embodied in human form. 

An archaeological discovery on the new universal Earth reveals that Starr the Slayer, and the "prehistoric" city of Zardath actually existed in Northern Europe centuries before [[Uruk]], the oldest known human city. Starr, accompanied by three other superhumans, had greatly accelerated the technological development of his people; excavation of Zardath's ruins revealed [[light bulb]]s possible traces of nuclear power. 

However, Starr was betrayed by the Nightmask [[Nightmask#newuniversal - Trull|Trull]], one of the other superhumans. Trull plotted against Starr's rule, destroyed the mind of his old friend [[Justice (New Universe)#newuniversal - Ukru|Ukru]] and preyed on other superhumans before they could reveal themselves to Starr and join Zardath.

Stripped of their minds, Trull's victims were hideously mutated by their own uncontrolled powers, becoming monstrous beasts - which Starr regularly fought and killed, without understanding their origin. Trull was eventually exposed when one of his victims, the mute girl Gila, managed to warn Starr before her death.<ref name="newuniversalconq">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Simon Spurrier]] | Artist = [[Eric Nguyen]] | Title = newuniversal: conqueror | Issue = 1 | Date =  October 2008| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Starr's subsequent actions are unknown.

Zardath was eventually buried beneath a rock shelf and undiscovered for approximately four and a half thousand years, uncovered only when earth drifted back into the newuniversal structure and the [[White Event]] created a new batch of superhumans. Starr himself had evidently died some time before Zardath was buried, as his body was entombed deep beneath the city; the tomb survived intact until Zardath was uncovered. 

When the tomb was excavated the Starbrand, the mark associated with a Starbrand's powers, was still visible etched into the forehead of Starr's skull.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7950</ref>
