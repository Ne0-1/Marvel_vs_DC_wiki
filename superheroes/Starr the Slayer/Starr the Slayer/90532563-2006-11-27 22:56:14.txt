'''Starr the Slayer''' is a [[fictional character]], the adventurer king of Zardath.
__FORCETOC__

==Chamber of Darkness==
The initial version of Starr was a [[barbarian]] king, defending his kingdom. A 20th century writer, Len Carson, dreamed of Starr's adventures - Starr later met and killed Carson. 

It is unclear whether or not Starr was intended to be part of the [[Marvel Universe]].

==newuniversal==
{{future comic}}
[[Warren Ellis]] has stated that a new version of Starr will appear in the upcoming [[newuniversal]] series. Preview art released in advance of the first issue has included design sketches for a barbarian character named as ''The Slayer'' - this appears to be the new version of Starr.
