'''Starr the Slayer''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Starr is the adventurer king of Zardath.

In 2007, writer [[Warren Ellis]] introduced a new version of Starr in the Marvel series [[newuniversal]]. 
__FORCETOC__
==Publication history==
===Chamber of Darkness===
The initial version of Starr was a [[barbarian]] king, defending his kingdom. A 20th century writer, Len Carson, dreamed of Starr's adventures - Starr later met and killed Carson. 

It is unclear whether or not Starr was intended to be part of the [[Marvel Universe]].

===newuniversal===
{{future comic}}
[[Warren Ellis]]'s current [[newuniversal]] series presents a re-interpretation of Starr the Slayer. In the newuniversal setting, worlds periodically pass through a trans-dimensional structure called the "newuniversal system" or the Superflow, an artifically intelligent alien construct with webs spread light years apart. The contact with the Superflow inevitably results in immense progress (or deterioration) in a given world's cultural, technological, social and mental state. To smooth this along, the newuniversal system empowers four sentient beings with specific abilities; one of these four, the Starbrand, is described as a planetary defense system embodied in human form. 

An archaeological discovery on the newuniversal Earth reveals that Starr the Slayer, and the "prehistoric" city of Zardath actually existed in Northern Europe centuries before [[Uruk]], the oldest known human city. Starr was that age's [[Starbrand]], using his considerable power and the abilities of his three companions to greatly accelerate the technological development of primitive humanity; this results in an off-kilter society where electric light bulbs are widely used but Starr himself still uses a sword, and building materials have not progressed past stone and wood. 

The newuniversal's Zardath apparently met an unfortunate fate, being buried beneath a rock shelf and undiscovered for approximately four and a half thousand years. Its demise was premediated enough, however, that Starr himself was entombed deep beneath the city after his death; the tomb was well-built enough to survive centuries, and had in fact survived millennia. The Starbrand, the tattoo that gives a Starbrand his powers, was visible etched on the forehead of Starr's skull.
