'''The Doom Patrol''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] team appearing in publications from [[DC Comics]]. The original Doom Patrol first appeared in ''My Greatest Adventure'' #80 (June 1963).  Writers [[Bob Haney]] and [[Arnold Drake]] and artist [[Bruno Premiani]] created the team.  The Doom Patrol has since appeared in multiple incarnations.

The first Doom Patrol consisted of super-powered misfits, whose "gifts" caused them alienation and trauma.  The Doom Patrol was canceled in 1968, and Drake killed them off in the final issue, ''Doom Patrol'' #121 (September-October 1968).

In the years after this story, the team developed a [[cult following]] {{Fact|date=October 2007}} and several subsequent Doom Patrol series were launched. Each series tried to capture the spirit of the original team, but the only character constant to all was [[Robotman (comics)#Cliff Steele|Robotman]].

==The Original Doom Patrol==

The Doom Patrol first appeared in 1963, when the DC title ''[[My Greatest Adventure]]'', an adventure anthology title, was being converted to a superhero format.  The task assigned writer Arnold Drake was to create a team that fit both formats. With fellow writer Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani, he created the Doom Patrol, a team of superpowered misfits regarded as freaks by the world at large. It first appeared in ''My Greatest Adventure'' #80, June 1963. Caulder motivated the original Doom Patrol, bitter from being isolated from the world, to use their powers for the greater good. The series was such a success that ''My Greatest Adventure'' was officially retitled ''The Doom Patrol'' beginning with issue #86.

The Doom Patrol's rogues gallery matched the strange, weird tone of the series.  Villains included the immortal [[General Immortus]], the shapeshifting [[Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man]], and the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] led by the [[The Brain (comics)|Brain]], an actual brain kept alive by technology. The Brotherhood of Evil also included the intelligent [[gorilla]] [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Madame Rouge]], a shapeshifter.

When the popularity of the book waned and the publisher canceled it, Drake ended the series in a dramatic manner: he killed off the entire Doom Patrol. In ''Doom Patrol'' #121 (September-October 1968), the Doom Patrol sacrificed their lives to save the small fishing village of Codsville, [[Maine]]. This marked the first time in comics’ history that a canceled book ended by having its entire cast of main characters die. Artist Bruno Premiani and editor Murray Boltinoff appeared at the beginning and the end of the story, asking fans to write to DC to resurrect the Doom Patrol, and several more issues appeared containing reprints of what they considered the best stories. Despite the efforts of the creators, a Doom Patrol revival did not occur for another nine years.

Fundamental similarities exist between the original Doom Patrol and Marvel Comics' original [[X-Men]]. Both include misfit super heroes shunned by society and both are led by men of preternatural intelligence confined to wheelchairs. These similarities ultimately led series writer Arnold Drake to believe that the concept of the Doom Patrol had been pilfered by Marvel to create X-Men.
Drake stated "...I’ve become more and more convinced that [Stan Lee] knowingly stole The X-Men from The Doom Patrol. Over the years I learned that an awful lot of writers and artists were working surreptitiously between [Marvel and DC]. Therefore from when I first brought the idea into [DC editor] Murray Boltinoff’s office, it would’ve been easy for someone to walk over and hear that [I was] working on a story about a bunch of reluctant superheroes who are led by a man in a wheelchair. So over the years I began to feel that Stan had more lead time than I realized. He may well have had four, five or even six months." (''X-Men'' #1 debuted three months after ''MGA'' #80)<ref>{{cite web

==Paul Kupperberg's Doom Patrol==
===Testing the waters===
[[Image:Showcase94.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Cover to ''Showcase'' #94, the first appearance of the second Doom Patrol. Art by [[Jim Aparo]].]]

Writer [[Paul Kupperberg]], a longtime Doom Patrol fan, and artist [[Joe Staton]] introduced a new team in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #94 (August-September 1977). An Indian-born woman named Arani Desai who called herself [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]] and claimed to be the widow of Niles Caulder led this team. This run also revealed the whereabouts of the Negative Spirit, which now possessed Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Valentina Vostok]], making her Negative Woman. It also revealed Robotman as the only survivor of the explosion that killed his teammates. He briefly wore a new, futuristic robot body, but returned to his original look after only two issues. This new version of the team lasted only a few issues before slipping into a series of guest appearances in other DC titles, such as ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' (teaming up with [[Superman]]) and ''[[Supergirl]]''. Robotman also appeared as an occasional supporting character in the [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Perez]] era of ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'', including a storyline when he and the Titans finally brought the murderers of the original Doom Patrol to justice.

===Prelude to the relaunch===
[[Eclipse Comics]] also printed a two-issue [[Official DC Index|index]] (with covers drawn by [[John Byrne]]) to the Doom Patrol in 1984, which included all of their appearances from their first to their final appearance before their early 1980s return. Byrne also illustrated ''Secret Origins Annual #1'', published in 1986, which recapped the origins of the two iterations of the Doom Patrol that had existed thus far, as a prelude to the relaunch of their self titled book.

===The relaunch===
The relaunch, also written by Kupperberg but illustrated by artist [[Steve Lightle]], later replaced by a young [[Erik Larsen]] after issue five, showed a more superheroic version of the Doom Patrol. It included new members who were hired to the team; the magnetically empowered strong-girl Lodestone; Karma, whose psychic power made sure than anyone trying to attack him would find themselves falling over themselves; and Scott Fischer, whose body generated phenomenal quantities of heat focussed through his hands, requiring him to wear protective gloves at all times. Most were not particularly interested in a heroic life, Lodestone stayed because it was security, Karma stayed there because it helped him hide from the law, only Scott Fischer ''wanted'' to be a superhero and he was rather naive about the real world. After issue eighteen and the events of the Invasion miniseries, Kupperberg left the series. DC Comics gave [[Grant Morrison]] the task of writing the book.

==Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol==
[[Image:Doompatrol.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Cover to ''Doom Patrol'' vol. 2, #19.  Morrison's first issue.  Art by [[Richard Case]].]]

After the first 18 issues (and various crossovers and annuals), Kupperberg was replaced by [[Grant Morrison]], starting with issue #19. Kupperberg agreed to help Morrison by writing out characters Morrison did not want to use. Celsius and Scott Fischer died before issue #19 (Celsius was killed in an explosion in DC Comics' "Invasion!" event, and Scott Fischer (already suffering from a recurrence of childhood leukemia) was the only known active superhero casualty of the Dominators' gene-bomb (also in "Invasion!"); Karma left the team as he was still on the run from the law (he would eventually become a member of the Suicide Squad and die on his first mission with them in the "War of the Gods" crossover event); the Negative Spirit left Negative Woman's body; and Lodestone plunged into a coma that she would remain in for the first half of Morrison's run on the book. [[Joshua Clay|Tempest]] gave up fieldwork to become the team's physician. Later members of team included [[Dorothy Spinner]], an ape-faced girl with powerful "imaginary friends," the multiple personality afflicted [[Crazy Jane]], and sentient roadway [[Danny the Street]].

Morrison used DC's ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' crossover to restart the book. He took the Doom Patrol, and superhero comic books in general, to places they had rarely been, incorporating bizarre [[secret society|secret societies]], elements of [[Dada]], [[surrealism]], and the [[cut-up technique]] pioneered by [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin]]. He also borrowed the ideas of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Heinrich Hoffmann]]. Morrison and artist [[Richard Case]] turned the title round and the series quickly gained a cult following, but some derided it as being incomprehensible. This did not include Arnold Drake who maintained that Morrison's was the only subsequent run to reflect the intent of the original series.<ref>{{cite web

Over the course of the series, Morrison dedicated some issues to parody and homage. Issue #53 featured a dream sequence that mimicked the [[Stan Lee]]/[[Jack Kirby]] ''Fantastic Four'', specifically the [[Galactus]] storyline. Another special called ''Doom Force'' was released as a one-shot and was meant to mimic the ''[[X-Force]]'' book by [[Rob Liefeld]]. Issue #45 parodied Marvel's [[Punisher]] in a satire called the Beard Hunter.

[[Image:Doom patrol50.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover to ''Doom Patrol'' vol. 2, #50. Art by [[Simon Bisley]].]]
Morrison's approach to the book was also notable in that his villains were extremely unusual and strange, even by Doom Patrol's eccentric standards.  For example: 
*Red Jack is a near-omnipotent being who thinks he is both [[Jack the Ripper]] and [[God]].  He lives in a house without windows, torturing butterflies, and cannot materialize in the world.
*[[Brotherhood of Dada|The Brotherhood of Dada]] are an anarchistic group who fight against reality and reason. It features members such as Sleepwalk, who can only use her tremendous powers when asleep (taking sleeping pills and listening to [[Barry Manilow]] before battles), and The Quiz, who literally has "every superpower you hadn't thought of" and a pathological fear of dirt.
*The [[Scissormen]], a fictional race of beings that attack non-fictional beings in the "real world" (i.e., the world the Doom Patrol live in) with the large scissors that they have instead of hands and literally cut people out of reality.

In Morrison's final storyline, it was revealed that the Chief had caused the "accidents" which turned Cliff, Larry Trainor and Rita Farr into freaks with the express intention of creating the Doom Patrol. He then murdered Josh and unleashed [[nanorobotics|nanobots]] onto the world, hoping to create a [[catastrophe theory|catastrophe]] which would make the world a stranger and more wonderful place. However, Caulder did not anticipate being decapitated by one of Dorothy's "imaginary" beings, a malign entity called [[the Candlemaker]].

==Rachel Pollack's Doom Patrol==
Morrison left the book with issue #63, and [[Rachel Pollack]] took over writing the book the next issue. Pollack's first issue was also the first under the new [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint of DC Comics (although the trade paperback edition of Morrison's work does bear the imprint, even if the original issues did not). Returning characters for Rachel Pollack's run were Cliff Steele, Niles Caulder (kept alive by the nanobots, but reduced to a disembodied head, usually kept on a tray filled with ice), and Dorothy Spinner. Pollack's run had Dorothy as a primary member of the Patrol by having her use her imaginary friends fight for her. Overall, Pollack's run dealt with issues such as the [[generation gap]], [[humanity]], [[identity]], [[transgenderism]], [[bisexuality]], and borrowed elements from [[Judaism]] and [[Kabbalah]] in the last few issues. The angel [[Akatriel]] is used as a major character in the last four issues.

The first story arc of her run was called ''Sliding In The Wreckage''. Cliff's computer brain started to malfunction and he regressed into flashbacks from previous storylines. Dorothy was haunted by African spirits while dealing with living alone in the real world. The Chief was given a new body by Will Magnus, but to atone for his sins he ripped his head off the body and was kept in cryogenic storage. Meanwhile, the entire Earth had been suffering from random outbreaks of weirdness, contributed by the arrival of something called "The Book of Ice." A government agency known as the Builders, similar to the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E., were trying to stop the outbreak, which was apparently linked to a race of shapeshifters known as the Teiresias. As the Chief was kept in cryogenic state, he appeared in the land of the Teiresias as a face carved in a mountain. They warned him that his arrival in this world was causing the craziness in the real world. Throughout the storyline, little people with backwards letters for heads had been seen altering people. These people were apparently older version of nanomachines, referred to as "nannos." At the DP HQ Builder agents attacked and in the craziness, two of the Teiresias approached Dorothy with a new brain for Cliff, but to insert it she needed the Chief's expertise. In the Teiresias world, nannos "repaired" the Chief so he could live as a severed head. After his awakening, the craziness seemed to stop, and Dorothy, Cliff, and the Chief each realized that they needed to be together.   

The team relocated to Violet Valley's Rainbow Estates, a house haunted by ghosts of those who died in sexual accidents. There, three new members joined. The Bandage People, George and Marion, who were once two workers for the Builders but managed to escape. And the Inner Child, a manifestation of the ghosts' purity and innocence. Another newcomer of the team was Kate Godwin, aka [[Coagula]], one of the first transsexual superheroes. A one-time ally of the team called the Identity Addict, who could become different superheroes by shedding his/her skin like a lizard, integrated him/herself back into the team while using the False Memory identity to change the team's memories, until he/she was kicked out by Dorothy.

Villains that the team fought, besides the Builders, included the Fox and the Crow, two animal spirits whose feud Dorothy and Cliff were subsequently pulled into; the Master Cleaner, a being with a human fetus inside a bubble for a head who began "cleaning" the world by stripping it down to nothing and replacing the stolen items, including people, with a paper ticket; and a group of Hassidic healers who called themselves the False Healers and their leader, the Rabbi of Darkness.

The series ended after Cliff Steele's brain became all robot, until Dorothy Spinner used her imaginary friends to "repair" it. The Chief would later die after trying to enter the [[Sephirot]] or Tree of Life.

A new artist, [[Ted McKeever]], took over the artwork for the final 13 issues. Pollack continued writing the title until its cancellation with issue #87, in February 1995.

==John Arcudi's Doom Patrol==
[[Image:Arcudi Doom Patrol.jpg|left|thumb|The Doom Patrol during John Arcudi's run on the title.  Art by [[Tan Eng Huat]].]]

In December 2001, writer [[John Arcudi]] and artist [[Tan Eng Huat]] launched a new ''Doom Patrol'' series. The launch of this series also saw the reversion of the publication of the title, from the Vertigo imprint back to DC Comics. The series lasted for twenty-two issues.

Arcudi's storylines revealed what happened to the previous team. Dorothy Spinner had a mental breakdown and accidentally killed most of the members still with the team at the end of the Pollack run. She fell into a coma, but subconsciously created a new Robotman, who became a part of a new Doom Patrol. This Doom Patrol was a company-owned team by Jost Enterprises, owned and operated by Thayer Jost, for a while before working independently. Marvel used a similar theme several months later with ''[[X-Statix]]'' as a commercially run team.

The Robotman that Dorothy created faded away when it realized what it actually was, but the other teammates searched for Cliff Steele, who became a member of the Doom Patrol yet again. They found his brain in a desolated area of the Smokey Mountains, buried under the rubble of the campsite where Dorothy's breakdown occurred. A prosthetics expert who defected from Russia rebuilt Cliff's body.

Jost, meanwhile, learned that he could not own the rights to the Doom Patrol since the man who signed the rights over to him was not actually Cliff Steele. So instead, he tried to obtain guardianship of the brain dead Dorothy. At the end of the series, Cliff pulled her life support.

Rounding out the four new members and Cliff were [[Elongated Man]], [[Metamorpho]], [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] and [[Beast Boy]], another former Doom Patroller.

==John Byrne's Doom Patrol==
[[Image:Doompatrol1.JPG|thumb|150px|Cover to ''Doom Patrol'' vol. 4, #1 (August 2004).  Art by [[John Byrne]].]]

In August 2004, DC launched a new ''Doom Patrol'' series after the new team debuted in ''[[Justice League|JLA]]''. John Byrne wrote and illustrated this series, with inks by [[Doug Hazlewood]]. Touted as "Together again for the first time!", Byrne rebooted the series, eliminating the continuity that dated back to the Silver Age.

This also retroactively eliminated Beast Boy's origins and numerous important Doom Patrol appearances, including the reunion of Beast Boy and Robotman in the 1980s ''Teen Titans'' and the team's important role in ''JLA: Year One''. It also angered some of Morrison's fans, but DC editors argued that the team's classic line-up should be supported, especially since attempts to continue the current continuity were unsuccessful. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} However, DC cancelled Byrne's series with issue #18. 

This reboot was both controversial and short-lived. The events in DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover saw the restoration of the Doom Patrol's full continuity, with the history of all previous incarnations, including Byrne's reboot, restored.

==''Infinite Crisis'' and ''One Year Later''==
[[Image:TeenTitansVol3-036.png|thumb|150px|left|Cover to ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #36 (July 2006), by Tony Daniel.]]

DC editorial used the events of the ''Infinite Crisis'' crossover to restore the Doom Patrol's continuity. In escaping from the paradise dimension they had inhabited since the end of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', [[Superboy-Prime]] and [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] created temporal ripples, which spread throughout reality, altering certain events, such as restoring [[Jason Todd]] to life.

While assisting the Teen Titans in battling Superboy-Prime, members of the Doom Patrol had flashbacks to their original history. Robotman and Niles Caulder regained memories of the previous Doom Patrol teams they were a part of. This battle apparently undid some of Superboy-Prime's timeline changes, and resulted in a timeline incorporating all previous incarnations of the Doom Patrol, but with Rita Farr and Larry Trainor still alive. The Chief confirmed that Rita was indeed killed by Zahl's explosion. The Chief claimed that he later found her skull and treated it with synthetic proteins until her malleable body was regrown from it.  Given that he had told lies to other members of the Patrol in that story, it remains to be confirmed if he was telling the truth in that case.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #36,</ref>

Steve Dayton is again using the Mento helmet and he is mentally unstable; however, he remembers his time as the Crimelord. The Chief appears to be manipulating the Doom Patrol members once again; he claims to wish to return them to normal, so "maybe one day [they] won't be freaks anymore." After the Doom Patrol encounters the Titans, the Chief tells them that [[Kid Devil]] should be a member of the Doom Patrol instead of the Titans, since his unique appearance and nature will always separate him from others. However, Beast Boy, Elasti-Girl and Mento all stood up to the Chief and forced him to step down as the Doom Patrol's leader. It seems that Mento is taking over that role.

Another twist is that while fighting the Titans and the Doom Patrol, the Brain claimed that he had been the Chief's lab assistant, his body destroyed in an explosion Caulder caused and that he was to be Robotman. 

The whereabouts of Nudge, Grunt and Vortex have yet to be revealed.

==Tangent Comics==
In 1997, DC released the [[Tangent Comics]] series of books, which were built on the premise of a world that diverged from the mainstream following the events of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The series featured characters with the same names as mainstream DC characters but who were otherwise unrelated to them. The series included a one-shot ''Doom Patrol'' title. This Doom Patrol consisted of four heroes, Doomsday, Star Sapphire, Firehawk and Rampage, who travelled back in time from 2030 to 1997 to prevent Earth's destruction. The Tangent books were later integrated into the DC Multiverse (as Earth-97) as part of the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

==Other media==
===Television===
On the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, the Doom Patrol made an appearance in the two-part episode "Homecoming", the season five premiere. Featuring Negative Man ([[Judge Reinhold]]), Robotman ([[Peter Onarati]]), Mento ([[Xander Berkeley]]), and Elasti-Girl ([[Tara Strong]]), this Doom Patrol was captured by the Brotherhood of Evil, with only Robotman free to save his comrades. After Robotman successfully sought out former Doom Patroller [[Beast Boy]], he and the Teen Titans teamed up to rescue the Doom Patrol. In flashbacks to Beast Boy's Doom Patrol days, it is clear that Mento and Elasti-Girl play parental roles toward the young masked hero. When Beast Boy has to make the choice to defeat the Brotherhood of Evil or save his friends in both teams, he elects to save his friends, a decision denounced by Mento and lauded by the Titans. 

The Chief is absent in the series. Mento acts as the team leader.

Throughout the fifth season of ''Teen Titans'', the team faces the menace of the Brotherhood, who wish to destroy all of the world's young heroes. The Titans gather these heroes, issuing each a Titans communicator and membership on the team. Finally, in a climactic battle, the Titans all work together and defeat the Brotherhood of Evil.<ref>*[http://titanstower.com/source/animated/behindcomiconpanel2005.html 'San Diego Comicon 2005: Teen Titans Behind The Scenes', ''Titans Tower''] ([[July 19]] 2005).
