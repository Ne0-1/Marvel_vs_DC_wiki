==The original Doom Patrol==
The Doom Patrol first appeared in ''My Greatest Adventure'' #80, June 1963.  ''My Greatest Adventure'', a [[supernatural]] anthology title, was being converted to a superhero format.  Writer [[Arnold Drake]] was assigned the task of creating a team that fit both formats.  With the help of writer [[Bob Haney]], Drake created the Doom Patrol, a team of superpowered misfits who were regarded as freaks by the world at large.  The initial membership of the Doom Patrol consisted of:

*'''[[The Chief (comics)|The Chief]]''': Dr. Niles Caulder was a [[paraplegic]] gifted with a genius-level intellect. Caulder used his scientific knowledge to develop numerous inventions and innovations that made him wealthy. It was Caulder who organized the Doom Patrol to protect the innocent and fight crime.
*'''[[Elasti-Girl]]''': Rita Farr was an actress who was exposed to unusual volcanic gases while shooting a film in [[Africa]]. When Farr recovered, she discovered that she could grow or shrink her body from roughly 1 inch to 100 feet tall. Elasti-Girl later enhanced her powers to enlarge one limb at a time.
*'''[[Negative Man (comics)|Negative Man]]''': Larry Trainor was a pilot who flew an experimental plane high into the Earth's atmosphere.  Trainor was buffeted by unexpected cosmic radiation, and when he landed, he discovered that his body had become radioactive. Trainor was also able to release and control a silhouette form he called Negative Man from his body. Negative Man, who could fly and pass through matter, could only remain out of Trainor's body for 1 minute at a time. Caulder developed special bandages that masked Trainor's radiation and allowed him to freely interact with others.
*'''[[Robotman (DC Comics)|Robotman]]''': Cliff Steele was a world-famous athlete who was nearly killed in a car crash during a race. Caulder successfully transferred Steele's brain into a robotic body that was resilient to harm and which possessed super-strength.

The initial Doom Patrol, bitter from being isolated from the world, were motivated by Caulder to use their powers for the greater good. The series was a success, and with issue 86, ''My Greatest Adventure'' was officially retitled ''The Doom Patrol''.  

The Doom Patrol's rogues gallery matched the strange, weird tone of the series. Villains included the immortal [[General Immortus]], the shapeshifting [[Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man]], and the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], which was led by the [[The Brain (comics)|Brain]], an actual brain that was kept alive by technology. The Brotherhood of Evil also included the intelligent [[gorilla]] [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Madame Rouge]], a shapeshifter.

The Doom Patrol would acquire 2 associate members over time. [[Steve Dayton]], one of the world's richest men, built a helmet to enhance his mental abilities. Calling himself '''Mento''', Dayton adopted the Mento identity to impress Elasti-Girl, whom he had fallen in love with. His plans were successful, and in ''Doom Patrol'' #104 (June 1966), Mento and Elasti-Girl were married. They soon adopted Garfield Logan, an orphaned boy who possessed the power to change form into any animal. Calling himself [[Beast Boy]], Logan joined the Doom Patrol on a part-time basis. Mento never officially joined the Doom Patrol, but would assist the team on several occasions.        

When the book's popularity waned and the book was canceled, Drake ended the series in a dramatic manner--he killed the Doom Patrol.  In ''Doom Patrol'' #121 (September-October 1968), the Doom Patrol sacrificed their lives to save a small fishing village in [[Maine]].  Artist [[Bruno Premiani]] and editor [[Murray Boltinoff]] appeared at the beginning and the end of the story, asking fans to write to DC to resurrect the Doom Patrol.  Despite the efforts of the creators, a Doom Patrol revival did not occur for 9 years.

==The new Doom Patrol==
In ''Showcase'' #94 (August-September 1977), a new Doom Patrol was introduced.  Robotman was revealed to have been the only survivor of the explosion that killed his teammates, and he soon joined a new Doom Patrol, which included the following:
*'''Celsius''': Arani Desai Caulder, who claimed to be Niles Caulder's wife, possessed the ability to generate blasts of hot or cold energy.  It was Celsius who organized the new Doom Patrol.
*'''Tempest''': Joshua Clay was a mutant who could fire powerful blasts from his hands.  Clay used this ability to fly, as well as for offensive uses.
*'''Negative Woman''': It was later revealed that Negative Man released his energy form just before his death.  The being formed a protective cocoon, which was destroyed when pilot Valentina Vostok crashed into the cocoon.  The freed being entered Vostok's body, and she became the host for Negative Woman.  Her powers were the same as Negative Man, although Negative Woman could speak in her energy form, unlike her predecessor.

Robotman briefly wore a new, futuristic robot body, but soon returned to his original look.  The new Doom Patrol proved unpopular, and only appeared in a handful of stories in the 1980s.

==The Morrison Doom Patrol==
In the late 1980s, another revival was attempted, beginning with longtime writer [[Paul Kupperberg]] and artist [[Erik Larsen]]. After 18 issues of standard superhero fare, Kupperberg was replaced by [[Grant Morrison]], who took the Doom Patrol and superhero comic books to places they'd rarely been, incorporating bizarre [[secret society|secret societies]], elements of [[Dada]], [[surrealism]], and the [[cut-up technique]] pioneered by [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin]]; the ideas of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also borrowed. Morrison's innovative run gained a [[cult following]], but was derided by others as incomprehensible.  Controversially, it also introduced the concept that Caulder was directly responsible for the accidents which mutilated Farr, Trainor, and Steele.  A few issues were dedicated to parody and homages, one issue featuring a dream sequence that mimics the [[Stan Lee]] / [[Jack Kirby]] ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', specifically the [[Galactus]] storyline.  Another special called ''Doom Force'' was released as a one-shot, and was meant to mimic the [[X-Force]] book by [[Rob Liefeld]]. 

Morrison's Doom Patrol featured enemies and curiosities such as:
*'''Red Jack''': a near-omnipotent being who thinks he is both [[Jack the Ripper]] and [[God]] and lives in a house without windows, torturing butterflies. Without pain he is unable to materialise in the world.
*''The Brotherhood of Dada'', which fights against reason and reality, led by '''Mr. Nobody''', a surrealist supervillain. 
*''The Scissormen'', beings from a living [[fairy tale]] city called Orqwith who cut their enemies out of reality.
*''The Cult of the Unwritten Book''. This huge, fanatical, quasi-gnostical cult is centered in the ghost of a German town, and intends to summon the '''Decreator''' (The equal and opposite of god, which appears as a huge eye).
*'''The Painting that Ate Paris'''.
*The warring alien ''Geomancers'' and ''Orthodoxy''.
*'''The Beard Hunter''', a psychotic hitman with a preference for murdering bearded men.
*'''Mr. Jones''', a deranged, escaped Pentagon agent, and the ''Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E.'', his surreal normalizing force.

Joining Robotman (who, by this point, preferred to called by his real name, Cliff Steele) and Niles Caulder were '''[[Crazy Jane]]''' (a.k.a. Kay Challis), a former mental patient suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]], where each identity had a unique set of superpowers, and '''Rebis''', a [[hermaphroditic]] being comprised, in part, of former Doom Patrol member Negative Man. Also returning to the team was Joshua Clay (formerly Tempest), who had given up superheroics to serve as the team's official physician. Rounding out the regular cast was young '''Dorothy Spinner''', a disfigured girl who had the ability to create physical manifestations of beings from her imagination, and '''Danny the Street''' a sentient, [[transvestite]] boulevard (which was typically illustrated through the presence of pink curtains on, for example, [[hardware store]]s).

During Morrison's tenure on the title, the [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint was launched, and this title was one of six transferred by DC to the new imprint for publication.

Morrison left after four years, and was replaced by [[Rachel Pollack]]. Returning for Rachel Pollack's run were Cliff Steele, Niles Caulder (now reduced to a disembodied head, usually kept on a tray filled with ice), and Dorothy Spinner. Newcomers included '''[[Coagula]]''' (a.k.a. Kate Godwin), a woman with the power to [[coagulate]] or [[dissolve]] any substance. Pollack continued with the title until its cancellation with issue #87 in February 1995.

The first issues from Morrison's run have been compiled into three Vertigo trade paperback editions: '''''Doom Patrol Volume 1: Crawling from the Wreckage''''' (issues #19-25), '''''Doom Patrol Volume 2: The Painting That Ate Paris''''' (#26-34), and '''''Doom Patrol Volume 3: Down Paradise Way''''' (#35-41), which was released in November, 2005.

==Other Doom Patrol revivals==
In December 2001, a fourth Doom Patrol title was launched by writer [[John Arcudi]] and artist [[Tan Eng Huat]].  The launch of this series also saw the reversion of the publication of the title, from the [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint back to [[DC Comics]].
The series, in which Robotman led a team of new, young heroes, lasted only 22 issues. The new members include:
*'''Fast Forward/Negative Man II''' (Ted Bruder)
*'''Kid Slick''' (Vig Darge)
*'''[[Fever (DC Comics)|Fever]]''' (Shyleen Lao), who has power over heat transfer and fire.
*'''Freak''' (Ava)

In August 2004, a new Doom Patrol series was launched, written and illustrated by [[John Byrne]], with inks by [[Doug Hazlewood]].  Touted as "Together again for the first time!", Byrne generated controversy among longtime Doom Patrol fans by rebooting the series, eliminating the continuity that dated back to the [[Silver Age]]. This also retroactively eliminated [[Beast Boy]]'s origins and numerous important DP appearances, including the reunion of Beast Boy and Robotman in the 80's [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and the team's important role in [[JLA: Year One]]. These continuity holes have yet to be repaired.  This angered some of Morrison's fans, but the argument supported by DC was that the classic line-up should be supported, especially since attempts to continue the current continuity were unsuccessful.

In the current series, the Chief, Elasti-Girl, Robotman, and Negative Man are joined by four new members:
*'''Grunt''', a four-armed gorilla
*'''Nudge''' (Mi-Sun Kwan), a teenage girl with telepathic powers who shares a bond with Grunt
*'''Vortex''', an energy being
*'''[[Faith (comics)|Faith]]''', a former JLA member whose abilities include flight, command of powerful energy, and the ability to inspire trust in those around her

The new team was introduced in the pages of [[JLA]]. This series has been cancelled with issue 18 according to the latest DC Comics solicitations.

==Other media==
