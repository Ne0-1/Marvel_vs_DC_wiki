'''The Doom Patrol''' is a name that has been used by 5 [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] teams.

The Doom Patrol first appeared in ''My Greatest Adventure'' #80, [[June]] [[1963]].  ''My Greatest Adventure'', a [[supernatural]] anthology title, was being converted to a superhero format.  Writer [[Arnold Drake]] was assigned the task of creating a team that fit both formats.  With the help of writer [[Bob Haney]], Drake created the Doom Patrol, a team of superpowered misfits who were regarded as freaks by the world at large.  The initial membership of the Doom Patrol consisted of:

*'''The Chief''': Dr. Niles Caulder was a [[paraplegic]] gifted with a genius-level intellect.  Caulder used his scientific knowledge to develop numerous inventions and innovations that made him wealthy.  It was Caulder who organized the Doom Patrol to protect the innocent and fight crime.
*'''Elasti-Girl''': Rita Farr was an actress who was exposed to unusual volcanic gases while shooting a film in [[Africa]].  When Farr recovered, she discovered that she could grow or shrink her body from roughly 1 inch to 100 feet tall.  Elasti-Girl later enhanced her powers to enlarge one limb at a time.
*'''Negative Man''': Larry Trainor was a pilot who flew an experimental plane high into the Earth's atmosphere.  Trainor was buffeted by unexpected cosmic radiation, and when he landed, he discovered that his body had become radioactive.  Trainor was also able to release and control a silhouette form he called Negative Man from his body.  Negative Man, who could fly and pass through matter, could only remain out of Trainor's body for 1 minute at a time.  Caulder developed special bandages that masked Trainor's radiation and allowed him to freely interact with others.
*'''Robotman''': Cliff Steele was a world-famous athlete who was nearly killed in a car crash during a race.  Caulder successfully transferred Steele's brain into a robotic body that was resilient to harm and which possessed super-strength.

The initial Doom Patrol, bitter from being isolated from the world, were motivated by Caulder to use their powers for the greater good.  The series was a success, and with issue 86, ''My Greatest Adventure'' was officially retitled ''The Doom Patrol''.  

The Doom Patrol's rogues gallery matched the strange, weird tone of the series.  Villains included the immortal General Immortus, the Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man(a shapeshifter), and the Brotherhood of Evil, which was led by the Brain, a brain that was kept alive by technology.  The Brotherhood of Evil also included the intelligent [[gorilla]] Monsieur Mallah and Madame Rouge, a shapeshifter.

The Doom Patrol would acquire 2 asoociate members over time.  Steve Dayton, one of the world's richest men, built a helmet to enhance his mental abilities.  Calling himself Mento, Dayton adopted the Mento identity to impress Elasti-Girl, whom he had fallen in love with.  His plans were successful, and in ''Doom Patrol'' #104 ([[June]] [[1966]]), Mento and Elasti-Girl were married.  They soon adopted Garfield Logan, an orphaned boy who possessed the power to change form into any animal.  Calling himself Beast Boy, Logan joined the Doom Patrol on a part-time basis.  Mento never officially joined the Doom Patrol, but would assist the team on several occasions.        
   
When the book's popularity waned and the book was canceled, Drake ended the series in a dramatic manner-he killed the Doom Patrol.  In ''Doom Patrol'' #121 ([[September]]-[[October]] [[1968]]), the Doom Patrol sacrificed their lives to save a small fishing village in [[Maine]].  Artist [[Bruno Premiani]] and editor [[Murray Boltinoff]] appeared at the beginning and the end of the story, asking fans to write to DC to resurrect the Doom Patrol.  Despite the efforts of the creators, a Doom Patrol revival did not occur for 9 years.

==The New Doom Patrol==

In ''Showcase'' #94 ([[August]]-[[September]] [[1977]]), a new Doom Patrol was introduced.  Robotman was revealed to have been the only survivor of the explosion that killed his teammates, and he soon joined a new Doom Patrol, which included the following:
*'''Celsius''': Arani Desai Caulder, who claimed to be Niles Caulder's wife, possessed the ability to generate blasts of hot or cold energy.  It was Celsius who organized the new Doom Patrol.
*'''Tempest''': Joshua Clay was a mutant who could fire powerful blasts from his hands.  Clay used this ability to fly, as well as for offensive uses.
*'''Negative Woman''': It was later revealed that Negative Man released his energy form just before his death.  The being formed a protective cocoon, which was destroyed when pilot Valentina Vostok crashed into the cocoon.  The freed being entered Vostok's body, and she became the host for Negative Woman.  Her powers were the same as Negative Man, although Negative Woman could speak in her energy form, unlike her predecessor. 
Robotman briefly wore a new, futuristic robot body, but soon returned to his original look.  The new Doom Patrol proved unpopular, and only appeared in a handful of stories in the [[1980s]].

==The Morrison Doom Patrol==
In the late [[1980s]], another revival was attempted, beginning with longtime writer [[Paul Kupperberg]]. After 17 issues, Kupperberg was replaced by [[Grant Morrison]], who took the Doom Patrol and superhero comic books to places they'd rarely been, incorporating bizarre [[secret society|secret societies]], elements of [[Dada]], [[surrealism]], and the [[cut-up technique]] pioneered by [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Brion Gysin]]; the ideas of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also borrowed. Morrison's innovative run gained a [[cult following]], but was derided by others as incomprehensable. Controversially, it also introduced the concept that Caulder was directly responsible for the accidents which mutilated Farr, Trainor, and Steele.

Morrison left after four years, and was replaced by Rachel Pollack.

==Other Doom Patrol revivals==

In [[December]] [[2001]], a 4th Doom Patrol title was launched by writer [[John Arcudi]] and artist [[Tan Eng Huat]].  The series, in which Robotman led a team of new, young heroes, lasted only 22 issues.  

In [[August]] [[2004]], a new Doom Patrol series was launched, written and illustrated by [[John Byrne]], with inks by [[Doug Hazlewood]].  Touted as "Together again for the first time!", Byrne generated controversy among longtime Doom Patrol fans by rebooting the series, eliminating the continuity that dated back to the [[Silver Age]].  In the current series, the Chief, Elasti-Girl, Robotman, and Negative Man are joined by three new members: Grunt, a four-armed gorilla; Nudge, a teenage girl with telepathic powers who shares a bond with Grunt; and Vortex, who can generate wind gusts.  The new team was introduced in the pages of [[JLA]].
