'''Angel Salvadore''', often simply called '''Angel''' but now going by the codename '''Tempest''', is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]]. She first appeared in ''[[New X-Men]]''  #118.

==Fictional character biography==

===Rescue===

'''Angel Salvadore''' is fourteen years old when her [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] nature first manifests, and she is driven out of her home by her abusive [[step-father]]. The following morning, she awakes and discovers that a [[cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] has formed; she emerges after sprouting a pair of wings. She is captured by [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]], humans who seek to harvest mutant body parts to graft onto themselves. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] rescues her from a mobile operating theatre by the side of the road. He kills all the U-Men and escorts her back to the school. They stop for a bite to eat, which is a mistake as the diner owner has gone insane from previous dealings with his mutant family. They are attacked when the owner sees Angel digesting her food in the manner of flies.

===Xavier Institute===

At first Angel doesn't fit in well, even annoying [[Emma Frost]]. She later helps the X-Men fight the menace of [[Cassandra Nova]] by working with the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] and stealing needed supplies. 

After accepting a bet to [[kiss]] [[Beak (comics)|Beak]],<ref>New X-Men  #131</ref> her classmate in the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]'s ;Special Class," Angel grew close to him, and they began to see each other romantically. Angel, Beak and the other Special Class students would be part of another confrontration with the U-Men, deep in the woods on the Xaiver Mansion grounds. Angel is the only one to see Xorn brutally murder the U-Men. He convinces her it would be their secret.

Angel and Beak's efforts would be recognized in a Prizegiving ceremony later held by the Institute. The two, not realizing they had any change of winning, had snuck outside, where Angel reveals to Beak she is pregnant<ref>New X-Men  #138</ref>. She would later lay pods in Wolverine's old shack. The two would try to keep it a secret, which led to Angel being a suspect in the seeming murder of Emma Frost. (She had done it, but only under telepathic control by Esme, one of the Stepford Cuckcoos).

Despite what the pair had come to believe, the X-Men welcome the children, who come to look mostly human but with wings.

===Xorn's Brotherhood===

Shortly afterwards, [[Xorn]], instructor of the Special Class, reveals himself to be the mutant [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He has been responsible for corrupting Esme and he had been teaching the class pro-Magneto propaganda under the guise of Xorn all along.

Angel is convinced to serve as a member of his latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The school is demolished and conquered. Manhattan itself is taken over by Magneto. Beak and her children come along as part of the Brotherhood. Beak rebels early on, not wanting to see captured humans killed. Beak is seemingly killed himself for his efforts, dropped from a levitating car. He survives and joins with the X-Men. Angel herself feels the need to rebel when Magneto threatens her fellow classmater Martha. Beak leads the X-Men back to Magneto's stronghold, using the key nobody had bothered to take from him before he was attacked. Magneto/Xorn is swiftly defeated and decapitated by Wolverine.

===Left On Her Own===

Later, Beak was unhinged from time<ref>Exiles #48</ref> and joined the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], ostensibly to prepare him for a future event during which several worlds will be threatened. As a result of this displacement, he was for a time unable to interact with beings from his home timeline, and his family believed him to have run away. Only by serving with the Exiles could he win them back. 

===Depowered===

As a result of the [[House of M]] event, Beak (who got back to his home reality thanks to the Exiles), his wife Angel and their children (except Tito) have lost their powers and unusual appearance, and are now finally able to live happily together again.<ref>Exiles #71</ref>

===New Warriors===   

Angel later resurfaced, along with her lover Beak, as a member of the newest incarnation of the [[New Warriors]]. Now going by the name Tempest, she has gained fire, ice and wind/flight powers given to her through technological means by [[Night Thrasher]].<ref>New Warriors (Vol. 4) #4</ref>  Her relationship with Barnell is noticeably more complacent than it has been in the past.

==Powers and abilities==
Angel possessed several superhuman abilities akin to those of the common housefly. She had a pair of veined wings growing from her back that allowed her to fly and which she could vibrate at high speed to create a deafening ultrasonic sound. She possessed a reproductive system that involved laying eggs with a complete gestation period of only five days from conception to birth. Angel was also able to vomit a highly acidic substance that she used to partially digest her food prior to consumption. As of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], she possesses no superhuman powers. When she later became a member of the New Warriors, she gained technologically based fire, ice, and flight powers from the new costume given to her.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the '''[[House of M]]''', Angel was a famous supermodel. She was possessed and nearly killed by [[Proteus (comics) | Proteus]].<ref>Exiles #69</ref>
