'''Angel Salvadore''', often simply called '''Angel''', is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Grant Morrison]] during his run on ''[[New X-Men]]''.  Her mutation is a partially [[insect|insectoid]] [[anatomy]] that gives her corrosive spit and insectoid wings that allow her to fly.  She was recruited by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] into enrolling in the [[X-Men]]'s [[Xavier Institute]].  She eventually had children with [[Beak (comics)|Beak]], Barnell Bohusk, a bird-like mutant also created by Morrison.

Angel Salvadore was fourteen years old when her [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] nature first manifested itself and she was driven out of her home by her abusive step-father. The following morning, she awoke and discovered that she had formed a coccoon about herself while she slept and had emerged after sprouting a pair of wings. She was then attacked by U-Men, humans who sought to harvest mutant body parts to graft onto themselves. 

Angel was rescued by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] who took her to the Xavier Institute where she reluctantly enrolled as a student. After accepting a bet to kiss [[Beak (comics)|Beak]], her classmate in the Xavier Institute's Special Class, Angel grew close to him and they began to see each other romantically. Angel would later reveal to Beak that she was pregnant and she laid pods on the ceiling of a shed on the school grounds. Her pods hatched during an investigation for the murder of [[Emma Frost]] where Angel was implicated as being the shooter.

Shortly afterwards, [[Xorn]], instructor of the Special Class, revealed himself to be the mutant [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and Angel was convinced to serve as a member of his latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Under the leadership of Beak, Angel and other members of the Special Class would rise up against Magneto and help guide the regrouping X-Men back to Magneto's stronghold where he was defeated.

Later on Beak was unhinged from time in order to gain experience from every harsh lesson he would learn with the Exiles in order to prepare him for a future event where several worlds will hang in the balance. As a result of his unhinging, he was for a time unable to interact with beings from his home timeline and his family believed him to have run away. Only by serving with the Exiles could he win them back. 

{{spoiler}}
As a result of the effects of the House Of M event, Beak (who got back to his home reality thanks to the Exiles), his wife Angel and their children (except Tito) have lost their powers and thus, their "hideous" appearence, and are now finally able to live happily together again.
