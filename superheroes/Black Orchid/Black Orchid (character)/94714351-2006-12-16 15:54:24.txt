'''Black Orchid''' is the name of three [[fictional]] [[superheroine]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The original version of the character first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #428 (July [[1973]]).

==Black Orchid I==
Although she has a number of superpowers—she can fly and is nigh-invulnerable—her main ability is a mastery of disguise. She often spends an entire investigation impersonating an insignificant background female, such as a maid, a secretary, someone's girlfriend, et cetera, and the other characters only discover her involvement at the end of the story upon finding the abandoned disguise with her calling card, a black [[orchid]].

After appearing in ''Adventure Comics'' #'s 428–430, the character next appeared as a backup feature in ''[[Phantom Stranger|The Phantom Stranger]]'' #'s 31–41 ([[1974]]–[[1976]]), after which the character appeared only sporadically, such as an occasional cameo in [[comic book]]s as diverse as the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' 12-issue limited series and ''[[Blue Devil]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #1 (both [[1985]]). She also appeared in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' (first series) as a member of the team in issues #4, 7, 11, 12, 19, and 22 (1987–1988).

==Black Orchid II==
In [[1988]], the character was relaunched in a three-part limited series called ''Black Orchid'' which was written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Dave McKean]]. The miniseries fleshed out the character considerably, providing an origin story which explained how and why she became known as Black Orchid. It also gave the character a civilian name in her origin sequence, Susan Linden-Thorne. She was given ties to the characters [[Swamp Thing]], [[Floronic Man]], and [[Poison Ivy]]. 

The original Black Orchid is killed in this miniseries, and a new one which is a "sister" of sorts to the original is introduced. She goes under the alias of Flora Black to meet with Sherilyn Sommers, her closest friend. 

An ongoing ''Black Orchid'' series, published under the [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, featuring the new Black Orchid, ran from [[1993]] to [[1995]]. The second version of the character used pheromone manipulation as [[mind control]] to became a [[femme fatale]], breaking and marrying millionaire Elliot Weems to claim his fortune and company business as her own. She then became the series' major villain in the closing story arc. She perished in the final issue. Her companion, a child version of Black Orchid heretofore nicknamed "Suzy", had matured over the course of the series, taking up the mantle of the third and final Black Orchid as a young adult.

==Black Orchid III==
Black Orchid '''III'''—the grown-up Suzy—is identical to the second and carries on the tradition in both the [[DC Universe]] and related Vertigo titles. She has appeared in four event titles: 1999's ''Totems'' graphic novel, 2001's ''Justice Leagues'' miniseries, 2005's ''Day of Vengeance'' miniseries, and 2006's ''Infinite Crisis'' miniseries. She is at present an ally of the [[Shadowpact]].

==Powers and abilities==
The first Black Orchid had superstrength, invulnerability, flight, and was a master of disguise. The second and third Black Orchids had superstrength, flight, and can absorb nutrients from the air. 

==Publication trivia==
The 1988 limited series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Limited Series in 1989, and for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Limited Series of the 1980s. The 1993 ongoing series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite New Continuing Series in 1993, the Squiddy Award for Most Improved Series in 1993 and 1994. Issue #8 of the series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Single Issue Story in a Series in 1993. The trade paperback collection of the mini-series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Reprint Volume in 1991.
