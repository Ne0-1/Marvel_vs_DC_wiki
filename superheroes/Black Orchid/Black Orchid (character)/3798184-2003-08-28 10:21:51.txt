'''Black Orchid''' is a [[fictional]] [[superheroine]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #428 ([[1973]]).

Although she has a number of superpowers -- she can fly and is nigh-invulnerable -- her main ability is a mastery of disguise. She often spends an entire investigation impersonating an insignificant background female, such as a maid, a secretary, someone's girlfriend, et cetera, and the other characters only discover her involvement at the end of the story upon finding the abandoned disguise with her calling card, a black [[orchid]].

After appearing in ''Adventure Comics'' #428-#430, the character next appeared as a backup feature in ''The Phantom Stranger'' #31-#41 ([[1974]]-[[1976]]), after which the character appeared only sporadically, such as an occasional cameo in [[comic-book]]s as diverse as the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' 12-issue limited series and ''Blue Devil Annual'' #1 (both [[1985]]).

In [[1988]], the character was relaunched in a three-part limited series called ''Black Orchid'' which was written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Dave McKean]]. The miniseries fleshed out the character considerably, providing an origin story which explained how and why she became known as Black Orchid. It also gave the character a civilian name. The original Black Orchid is killed in this series, and a new one which is a "sister" of sorts to the original is introduced.

An on-going ''Black Orchid'' series, featuring the new Black Orchid, ran from [[1993]] to [[1995]].
