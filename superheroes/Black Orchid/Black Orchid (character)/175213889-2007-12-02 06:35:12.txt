'''Black Orchid''' is the name of three [[fictional]] [[superheroine]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The original version of the character first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #428 (July [[1973]]).

==Susan Linden-Thorne==

Although she has a number of superpowers —she can fly and is super-strong and bulletproof- her main ability is a mastery of disguise. She often spends an entire investigation impersonating an insignificant background female, such as a maid, a secretary, someone's girlfriend, et cetera, and the other characters only discover her involvement at the end of the story upon finding the abandoned disguise with her calling card, a black [[orchid]].

After appearing in ''Adventure Comics'' #'s 428–430, the character next appeared as a backup feature in ''[[Phantom Stranger|The Phantom Stranger]]'' #'s 31, 32, 35, 36, and 38–41 ([[1974]]–[[1976]]), after which the character appeared only sporadically, such as an occasional cameo in [[comic book]]s as diverse as three panels in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' 12-issue limited series and ''[[Blue Devil]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #1 (both [[1985]]), as well as ''[[Deadshot]]'' vol. 1 #1 and [[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]] #2. She also appeared in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' as a member of the team in issues #4, 7, 11, 12, 19, and 22 (1987–1988).  She also had an appearance in the non-continuity ''[[Super Friends]]'' #31.

''Adventure Comics'' #428 proclaimed on its cover that it was an "origin issue," although almost no background on the character is given, not even her name.  Until Neil Gaiman explained her origin, the character was, in fact, most famous for her lack of an origin.

==Flora Black==

In [[1988]], the character was relaunched in a three-part prestige format limited series called ''Black Orchid'' which was written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Dave McKean]]. The miniseries fleshed out the character considerably, providing an origin story which explained how and why she became known as Black Orchid. It also gave the character a civilian name in her origin sequence, Susan Linden-Thorne. Instead of being a normal super-powered human (or '''meta''' in the DC Universe), her background was changed to be that of a human-plant hybrid with ties to the [[Parliament of Trees|Green]]. In this way she became related with other such human-plant hybrids as the [[Swamp Thing]], [[Floronic Man]], and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]]. 

The original Black Orchid is killed in this miniseries, and a new one which is a "sister" of sorts to the original is introduced. She goes under the alias of Flora Black to meet with Sherilyn Sommers, her closest friend. 

An ongoing ''Black Orchid'' series, published under the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint, featuring the new Black Orchid, ran from [[1993]] to [[1995]]. The second version of the character used pheromone manipulation as [[mind control]] to become a [[femme fatale]], breaking and marrying millionaire Elliot Weems to claim his fortune and company business as her own. She then became the series' major villain in the closing story arc. She perished in the final issue. Her companion, a child version of Black Orchid heretofore nicknamed "Suzy", had matured over the course of the series, taking up the mantle of the Black Orchid as a young adult.

==Suzy==
The grown-up Suzy is identical to her "sister" and carries on the tradition in both the [[DC Universe]] and related Vertigo titles. She has appeared in four event titles: 1999's ''[[Totems (comics)|Totems]]'' [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], 2001's ''[[Justice Leagues]]'' miniseries, 2004's ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', 2005's ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, and 2006's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries. She is at present an ally of the [[Shadowpact]].

==Powers and abilities==
The first Black Orchid had superstrength, invulnerability, flight, and was a master of disguise. The second and third Black Orchids had superstrength, flight, and can absorb nutrients from the air. The second version could generate seductive pheromones.

==Awards==
The 1988 limited series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Limited Series in 1989, and for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Limited Series of the 1980s. The 1993 ongoing series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite New Continuing Series in 1993, the Squiddy Award for Most Improved Series in 1993 and 1994. Issue #8 of the series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Single Issue Story in a Series in 1993. The trade paperback collection of the mini-series was nominated for the Squiddy Award for Favorite Reprint Volume in 1991.
