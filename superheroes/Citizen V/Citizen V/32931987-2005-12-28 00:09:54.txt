'''Citizen V''', is the codename of several [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The original Citizen V was an obscure hero from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], but the character's identity was revived in the modern day in the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]''.  The various incarnations of the character have usually been affiliated with an organization called the [[V-Battalion]].  The "V" in the character's and group's name is the letter "V", and is derived from the World War II-era slogan "V for Victory".

==World War II onward==
The original Citizen V was John Watkins, an [[Englishman]] who assisted the [[French resistance|resistance]] in [[Nazi]]-occupied France.  He led a group of [[freedom fighters]] called the V-Battalion, the membership of which included Paulette Brazee, also known as the She-Wolf.  He was killed in action by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], and Paulette took up the Citizen V identity.  After the end of World War II, the V Battalion hunted down Nazi fugitives.  The organization subsequently assimilated the remnants of the superheroic [[All-Winners Squad]] in the late 1940s, reimagining it as a clandestine peacekeeping force, led by Roger Aubrey (the [[Destroyer (Golden Age)|Destroyer]]).  John Watkins Junior, the son of John Watkins and Paulette Brazee, became Citizen V and led the V Battalion upon reaching adulthood, as did his own son, John Watkins III.

In the modern era, the Citizen V identity (with a completely redesigned costume) was adopted by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]], who claimed to be the grandson of the original while posing as a hero with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].  After he abandoned the role, it was taken up by [[Vantage (comics)|Dallas Riordan]], the Thunderbolts' former [[New York City]] liaison, whose paternal grandfather was a member of the V-Battalion (according to the ''[[Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe]]: Women of Marvel 2005'', she is the granddaughter of John Watkins and Paulette Brazee).

Shortly after Riordan was crippled in battle with the [[Crimson Cowl]], Helmut Zemo was killed by the [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]], but due to a failsafe/prank by [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]], his mind ended up in the comatose John Watkins III. In this body, Zemo retook the role while posing as Watkins, until a teleportion accident removed Zemo's mind from the body, leaving Watkins awake and in control of his own body for the first time in five years. John Watkins III continues to act as Citizen V, and serves as the field leader of the V Battalion.
