'''Shinobi Shaw''', also known as a '''White King''' of the '''Hellfire Club''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe]].  He is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]], a foe of the [[X-Men]] and their affiliated teams. His first appearance was in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #67 (June 1990).

==Fictional character biography==
Shinobi is thought to be the son of [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], the leader of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Shinobi himself has been somewhat uncertain about this as his powers are more like the former Black Bishop of the Club, [[Harry Leland (comics)|Harry Leland]]. 

Shaw was a member of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a group made up of [[Siena Blaze]], [[Graydon Creed]], [[Fabian Cortez]], [[Trevor Fitzroy]] and probationary members Andreas and Andrea Strucker (of [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]]). They were manipulated by the Gamemaster and originally [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], but the group quickly turned against her.  The group participated in an elaborate game, wherein they would hunt and kill assigned targets for points. During one of these games, the Upstarts targeted the surviving members of the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Hellions]], but were defeated by the combined forces of [[X-Force]] and the [[New Warriors]].{{issue}}

Shaw once attempted to kill his father, and initially believed himself successful (though his father would resurface later). Shaw was briefly able to take control of the Hellfire Club, assuming the mantle of Black King. Enjoying the luxury of the position, he was attended by many beautiful scantily clad female and male servants. Eager to return the Inner Circle to its former glory, Shaw approached [[Psylocke|Elizabeth Braddock]] and [[Archangel (comics)|Warren Worthington]], attempting to convince them to become a part of the Inner Circle. Both X-Men refused, however. He also tried to enlist [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] as a member, but she also refused.{{issue}}

Later, he worked with [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and [[Mindmeld]] as they experimented on [[Karma (comics)|Karma]]'s siblings.  However, his personal assassin [[Clear-Cut (comics)|Clear-Cut]] betrayed Shinobi and aided [[X-Force]] in defeating him.{{issue}}

Shinobi was confirmed as being one of a handful of mutants who retained their powers following [[M-Day]].<ref>''X-Men: 198 Files''</ref> Sometime after M-Day, Shinobi was killed by his father, and then resurrected by Selene. He is then sent with Harry Leland to kill his father and Donald Pierce.<ref>''X-Necrosha'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Shinobi is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who can alter his body's [[density]] from diamond-hard to intangible. He usually uses it as a means of escape, but he can also use the intangibility to reach into an opponent's heart and induce a heart attack (this has no visible adverse affects on Shaw himself). Although he does not demonstrate it well, Shinobi Shaw considered himself a criminal mastermind of the highest calibre.

==Other Versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===

Shinobi Shaw has recently appeared in the [[Ultimate X-Men]] title, as [[Emma Frost]]'s boyfriend. He is a member of the [[Academy_of_Tomorrow#Ultimate_X-Men|Academy of Tomorrow]], in addition to the Hellfire Club. One of his operatives, Gerald Levine, is currently spying on the Xavier Institute and [[Alternate_versions_of_Jean_Grey#Ultimate_Jean_Grey.2FMarvel_Girl|Marvel Girl]], under his orders. When visiting the school Shinobi and Gerald attacked Jean in an attempt to capture the [[Phoenix God]]. This failed, as the Phoenix fought back, and both Shinobi & Gerald were taken into police custody. Later, it is revealed that Emma's also a member of the Hellfire Club in secret.
