'''Shinobi Shaw''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe]].  He is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]], a foe of the [[X-Men]] and their affiliated teams.  Shinobi is the son of [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], the leader of [[The Hellfire Club (comics)|the Hellfire Club]].  Some of Shinobi Shaw's body is prosthetic as a result of injuries suffered battling [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].

Shinobi is a [[mutant]] who can can alter his body's [[density]] from diamond-hard to intangible. He usually uses it as a means of escape, but he can also use the intangibility to reach into an opponent's heart and induce a heart attack (this adversely affects the person who he is "phasing" into, but has no adverse affects on Shaw himself).

Shinobi once attempted to kill his father, and was allowed to believe himself successful; although his father lived, Shinobi was able to take control of the Hellfire Club briefly.  Now that his father has returned to power, Shinobi's whereabouts are undetermined.
