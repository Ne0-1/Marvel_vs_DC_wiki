'''Shinobi Shaw''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe]].  He is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]], a foe of the [[X-Men]] and their affiliated teams. His first appearance was in ''[[X-Factor]]'' #69 (August 1990).

==Character biography==
Shinobi is thought to be the son of [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], the leader of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Shinobi himself has been somewhat uncertain about this: his powers are more like the former Black Bishop of the Club, [[Harry Leland (comics)|Harry Leland]]. He is often confused with one of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s enemies, Reiko.

Shinobi once attempted to kill his father, and was allowed to believe himself successful; although his father lived. Shinobi was able to take control of the Hellfire Club briefly.  Now that his father has returned to power, Shinobi's whereabouts are undetermined.

==Powers and abilities==
Shinobi is a [[mutant]] who can can alter his body's [[density]] from diamond-hard to intangible. He usually uses it as a means of escape, but he can also use the intangibility to reach into an opponent's heart and induce a heart attack (obviously, this adversely affects the person who he is "phasing" into, but has no adverse affects on Shaw himself). Shinobi Shaw considered himself a criminal mastermind of the highest order but he did not do well to demonstrate this.
