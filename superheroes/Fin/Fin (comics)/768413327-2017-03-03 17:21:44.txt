===Publication history===
The Fin first appeared in ''[[Daring Mystery Comics]]'' #7-8, (April 1941, Jan.1942), and was created by [[Bill Everett]]. Decades later, a [[simulacrum]] of the Fin briefly appeared, along with simulacra of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], and the Golden Age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] and [[Vision (Timely Comics)|Vision]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''The Avengers''  #97 (March 1972).

In 2004 the Fin was revived by Marvel Comics and appeared as an ally of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] in that team's series ''The New Invaders'' #2-3 (Nov.-Dec. 2004), #6 (March 2005), and #8-9 (Mayâ€“June 2005).  He was in the (unfinished) miniseries All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes as a member of the [[Crazy Sues (comics)|Crazy Sues]], a unit of Allied men with special abilities during World War II.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The Fin received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Golden Age'' (2004).

===Fictional character biography===
Peter Noble was a Navy officer who was caught in a sinking [[submarine]] and was shocked to find that the immense pressure and lack of air did not kill him. He discovered an undersea civilization called Neptunia, and after several adventures on and under the sea he was made the Neptunians' ruler.

At some unknown point he met, fell in love with and married [[Nia Noble]], who became his Queen and co-ruler. Half a century later, he was called back to America and recalled to active duty as an admiral in command of a new vessel, the ''Infiltrator''.<ref>''[[New Invaders|Invaders]]'' (vol. 3) #2</ref> This ship was no ordinary [[battleship]]; it had been designed by Bruce Dickson, the [[Thin Man (comics)|Thin Man]], using technology from an incredibly advanced civilization. ''Infiltrator'' was capable of taking shortcuts through space, in theory making it undetectable and uncatchable. Noble and his wife came aboard and ran the ship's day-to-day operations, with the vessel acting as a base for the New Invaders team of superhuman operatives in their battle against the evil Neo-Nazi group called '''Axis Mundi'''. In the end, the vessel was destroyed and the Invaders members went their separate ways. Admiral Noble (ret.) once again returned to Neptunia with his bride to take up his duties as ruler.

===Powers and abilities===
The first Fin has twenty times normal human strength and is able to survive the crushing pressures of the ocean's depths. He can breathe air or water, and can swim as fast as a [[torpedo]]. However, if not immersed in water, his strength gradually weakens. The Fin is armed with a magical [[cutlass]], able to cut through nearly anything. The cutlass's magic also prevents him from aging.

==Fin (Wild Pack)==
The second Fin is a character originally from the 1990s series ''[[Silver Sable and the Wild Pack]]''.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #11 (April 1993)</ref> Although he initially disputed the name Fin, when pressed to reveal his real identity by fellow Intruder [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] he begrudgingly accepted the moniker others had given him.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #20 (January 1994)</ref>

He is later seen as a member of the Garrison,<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z hardcover'' Volume #5 (October 2008)</ref> the [[Vermont]] [[Fifty State Initiative]] superhero team, joined by fellow Intruders and Wild Pack [[alumni]] [[Man-Eater (comics)|Man-Eater]].<ref>''Penance: Relentless'' #3 (November 2007)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The second Fin has uncharted superhuman strength as well as the ability to send out a signal toward any object one hundred times a second, possibly a form of [[sonar]], used for [[acoustic location|echolocation]].  He is also a [[physics]] expert, whether or not this is merely a personal interest of Fin's or he possesses formal training, is as yet unrevealed.  Fin has kept his scientific expertise somewhat quiet in an attempt to prevent being exploited for his knowledge.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #20 (January 1994)</ref>
