The '''Fin''' is a fictional character appearing in [[comic books]] published by [[Timely Comics]], the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] ancestor of [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has elements of both the [[swashbuckling]] [[pirate]] and [[superhero]] genres. He first appeared in ''Daring Mystery Comics'' #7, April, 1941.

In 2004 the Fin was revived by Marvel Comics and appeared as an ally of the [[Invaders]] in that team's series ''The New Invaders''.

==Fictional character biography==
{{spoilers}}

Peter Noble was a Navy officer who was caught in a sinking [[submarine]] and was shocked to find that the immense pressure and lack of air did not kill him. He discovered an undersea civilization called Neptunia, and after several adventures on and under the sea he was made the Neptunians' ruler.

At some unknown point he met, fell in love with and married [[Nia Noble]], who became his Queen and co-ruler. Half a century later ([[New Invaders|Invaders]] (vol. 3) #2), he was called back to America and recalled to active duty as an Admiral in command of a new vessel, the ''Infiltrator''. This ship was no ordinary battleship; it had been designed by Bruce Dickson, the [[Thin Man (comics)|Thin Man]], using technology from an incredibly advanced civilization. ''Infiltrator'' was capable of taking shortcuts through space, in theory making it undetectable and uncatchable. Noble and his wife came aboard and ran the ship's day-to-day operations, with the vessel acting as a base for the New Invaders team of superhuman operatives in their battle against the evil Neo-Nazi group called '''Axis Mundi'''. In the end, the vessel was destroyed and the Invaders members went their separate ways. Admiral Noble (ret.) once again returned to Neptunia with his bride to take up his duties as ruler.

==Powers and Abilities==
The Fin has twenty times normal strength and is able to survive the crushing pressures of the ocean's depths. He can breathe air or water, and can swim as fast as a torpedo. However, if not immersed in water, his strength gradually weakens.

The Fin is armed with a magical sword, able to cut through nearly anything. The sword's magic also prevents him from aging.
