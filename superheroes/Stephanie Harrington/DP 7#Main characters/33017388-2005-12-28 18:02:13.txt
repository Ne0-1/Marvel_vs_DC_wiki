'''D.P. 7''' was a 32-issue [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] under their [[New Universe]] imprint from [[1986]] to [[1989]].  Along with ''[[Justice (New Universe)|Justice]]'' and ''[[Psi-Force]]'', it was one of the only New Universe title to last for 32 issues.

The title stands for ''Displaced Paranormals'' and refers to the seven main characters of the series (who never referred to themselves by this name since they didn't look to be [[superhero]]es, unlike ''[[Kickers, Inc.]]'').  All of them received certain superhuman powers as a result of the stellar phenomenon known as the ''White Event'' (later revealed in a ''[[Star Brand (comics)|Star Brand]]'' comic to be the result of an individual's attempt to give up a cosmic-powered weapon).

==Main Characters==

*'''Randy O'Brien''', nicknamed '''Antibody''', was a [[medical resident]] who could project a dark figure of himself that flew, could become intangible like the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]], and transfer its host's (O'Brien's) memories to another person  by physical contact.  At the beginning of the series, O'Brien could only project and within limits control one of these entities.  After the original was destroyed, five antibodies manifested themselves and gradually developed their own personalities.  The series ended with O'Brien becoming an antibody himself.

*'''David Landers''', nicknamed '''Mastodon''', was a [[cheese]] [[factory]] worker who became stronger as new muscles grew into his body, an effect that caused him great pain.  When on the run from the [[Clinic for Paranormal Research]], Landers met another group of paranormals known as the ''ESPeople'', and one of their members made his mind unable to be probed by [[telepathy|telepath]]s.

*'''Jeff Walters''', nicknamed '''Blur''', was a [[fast food]] [[restaurant]] [[manager]] whose body vibrated so fast that he could not stand still.  He required vast amounts of [[food]] for his accelerated metabolism and could also move at superhuman speed.

*'''Charlotte Beck''', nicknamed '''Friction''', was a [[dance]] [[student]] who acquired the power to make herself, anything she touched, and any other object she thought about within a limited range [[friction]]-free enough to make the object or person slide effortlessly.  Over time, Beck learned to make her power object-specific and during ''[[The War (comics)|The War]]'' was a special [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative.

*'''Dennis "Scuzz" Kazinski''' was a [[teenager|teenage]] [[dropout]] who produced an [[acid]]-like substance from his [[skin]].  He could increase his skin's production but not stop it, turning anything he wore into a tattered ruin within days and burning through a [[steel]] plate in ten seconds.  By the end of ''D.P. 7'', he became a member of the [[Cult]] of the White Event and attempted to stop Cure, another paranormal who'd acquired the power to remove others' paranormalities.  The others stopped Scuzz from killing Cure, but not without Scuzz succeeding in severely burning Cure's hands through which his power had to be projected.

*'''Stephanie Harrington''', nicknamed '''Glitter''', was a [[housewife]] and mother of three who had the power to heal and energize others by physical contact.  The use of this power was accompanied by the appearance of twinkling stars and when not used internalized itself to make Harrington superhumanly strong.  She eventually became [[divorce]]d from her husband who placed her in the Clinic and was [[recruit|recruited]] into the CIA during ''The War''.

*'''Lenore Fenzl''', nicknamed '''Twilight''', was a [[retired]] [[Latin]] [[teacher]] whose body constantly produced "[[fatigue]]-poison inducing [[bioluminescence]]" that could [[paralysis|paralyze]] and render unconscious individuals exposed to it.  The amount of time would depend on how long one was exposed, and individuals with accelerated metabolisms like Walters would slow to normal speed.  Fenzl's power required her to remain covered over her entire body at all times, and after leaving the Clinic for the second time became a special CIA agent during ''The War''.

==Plot synopsis==
{{msg:spoiler}}

Randy O'Brien first encounters David Landers when he's wheeled into the [[hospital]] in incredible [[pain]].  Landers rages until two dark arms spring from O'Brien's [[torso]] that restrain him long enough for O'Brien to give Landers a [[tranquilizer]] that renders him unconsciousness.  The two compare their experiences, and O'Brien reads a [[classified ad]] for the Clinic for Paranormal Research, a facility designed to help individuals who've acquired strange abilities.  Through his antibody (see above), he relays the information to Landers and they travel to the Clinic under assumed names.  They are at first convinced of the Clinic staff's sincerity and are enrolled into Therapy Group D, where they meet Walters, Beck, Kazinski, Harrington, and Fenzl.  Late one night, O'Brien's antibody intrudes on the Clinic staff, at least four of whom are paranormals themselves, and learn the Clinic has plans to make an [[army]] out of them, to be led by ''Philip Nolan Voight'', the Clinic director who acquired the power to magnify anyone else's for his own use.  

Therapy Group D fights off the Clinic staff and the paranormal Hackbarth who can mainpulate others' [[nervous system]]s.  They escape into the night and over the next year (twelve issues; unlike most comics, a year in the New Universe equalled a year in our own), the paranormals adjust to life with their powers.  Scuzz runs away at one point; he and everyone else is eventually apprehended by [[bounty hunter]]s and returned to the Clinic.  O'Brien and Landers, the last two to arrive, find their friends have been behavior-modified to not remember their escape or the Clinic's ulterior motives.  O'Brien and Landers defeat Voight and he disappears from the Clinic, although he later reappears to run for [[President of the United States|President]] in [[1988]].

Without Voight and his senior staff (the aforementioned Hackbarth is in a [[coma]], [[memory]] manipulator Charne was choked to death by an antibody, and telecognitive Speck was shot) to surreptitiously maintain order, paranormals at the Clinic soon form their own special interest groups (one is comprised of Clinic teenagers, one of [[African Americans]], etc.).  The potential for major disaster is soon fulfilled, and [[law enforcement]] soon comes in to shut the Clinic down, killing many of the patients in the process.  By this time, most of the reformed Therapy Group D has struck out on their own.  Except for Scuzz, the Displaced Paranormals are brought together after ''all'' paranormals are drafted into the [[United States Army]] after the destruction of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], believed to be caused by a [[nuclear weapon]] (though actually caused by another attempt to relinquish the Star Brand).

When the War is over, the Paranormals return to lives as normal as they can.
