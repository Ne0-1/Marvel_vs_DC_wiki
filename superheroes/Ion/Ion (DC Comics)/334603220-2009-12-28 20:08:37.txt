'''Ion''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]].  Created by [[writer]] [[Judd Winick]] and artist [[Dale Eaglesham]] for ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 3) #142, Ion was devised as the new superhero identity for ''Green Lantern'' protagonist [[Kyle Rayner]]. It was later revealed to be a benevolent [[symbiote]], bestowing its power to a host willingly. This followed a similar [[retcon]] as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], originally the new supervillain alias of [[Hal Jordan]], which was revealed to be a parasitic embodiment of fear in the 2004-2005 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Ion-20060124115140093.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Kyle Rayner as Ion, the Torchbearer of the [[Guardians of the Universe]].]]
As soon as sentient beings developed willpower, Ion was born, from the green wavelength of the so-called "[[emotional spectrum]]".  Its existence has been kept a secret for eons, and it resided in the Central Battery on Oa to keep [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], the parasitic fear entity also imprisoned there, in check, as well as granting the [[Guardians of the Universe]], [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]], The Green Glob, Halla's, and then The [[Green Lantern Corps]] a portion of its vast powers.  After Hal Jordan, under the influences of Parallax and [[Sinestro]], destroyed the Central Battery, Ion, along with Parallax and Sinestro, were set free.  After wandering throughout the cosmos, it eventually settled within Kyle Rayner as its host. <ref> ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps'' Secret Files & Origins #1</ref>

===Power of Ion===
Kyle first assumes the Ion identity after a prolonged series of events stemming from the death of his girlfriend [[Alexandra DeWitt|Alex]]. First, he unconsciously expels all his feelings of rage from himself, which takes physical form as one of Kyle's childhood nightmares and calls itself Oblivion. Kyle defeats Oblivion in the ''[[Green Lantern: Circle of Fire|Circle of Fire]]'' storyline, and his powers are boosted as a result. Over time his powers begin to grow even stronger until Kyle realized he is tapping into the Green Lantern energy left in the sun after Hal Jordan died. After a battle over control of the power with the villain [[Nero (DC Comics)|Nero]], Kyle absorbs all the powers of the Green Lantern Corps, resulting in Kyle taking the name ''Ion''.

Kyle uses his newly expanded abilities to recreate the [[Guardians of the Universe]] on the planet Oa, whom he places in the care of [[Ganthet]] and orders him to teach them humility, and then recharges the Central Power Battery on Oa. Kyle divests himself of his new abilities soon afterwards when he realizes he is losing touch with the people he was protecting.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns]]|penciled by=[[Ethan Van Sciver]]|story=Green Lantern: Rebirth|title=[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]|issue=1-6|date=October 2004-April 2005|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

===Return of Ion===
Some time after resuming the Green Lantern identity, Kyle becomes Ion once again when [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] transfers all of her abilities to Kyle after her death during the events of the [[Rann-Thanagar War]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Ron Marz]]|title=[[Ion (comics)|Ion The Torchbearer]]|issue=1|month=March | year=2006|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>  This is then followed by a twelve part Ion miniseries.  The series follows Kyle as he accepts his new role as "The Torchbearer" for the Guardians and the Corps.  While doing so, he is confronted with the most challenging adversaries from his past as Green Lantern and the sudden illness of his mother.  The events of the series are revealed to be a conspiracy against him and serve to launch Kyle towards his roles in the Sinestro Corps War and the events of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]''.<ref>''Ion: Guardian of the Universe'' #1-12</ref>

===Sinestro Corps War===
{{main|Sinestro Corps War}}
The first issue of "The Sinestro Corps" reveals that, like the retcon origin of Parallax, the Ion symbiote is a separate being, forcefully extracted from Kyle and imprisoned on [[Qward]] by the [[Sinestro Corps]]. Upon expelling Ion from Rayner, [[Sinestro]] forces Kyle to bond with [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], who invades Kyle and takes control of his body.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns]]|penciller=[[Ethan Van Sciver]]|story=Sinestro Corps War|title=Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special|issue=1|month=June | year=2007|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>  The Ion entity is eventually freed by several members of the Green Lantern Corps after being experimented on by the [[Anti-Monitor]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #23</ref>  

In ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'' #17, the Guardians, feeling that Kyle better serves the Corps as a Green Lantern, choose the [[Daxam]]ite [[Sodam Yat]] as the new host for Ion.

Witnessing the creation of the new Ion, [[Superman-Prime]] confronts him and they fight in the skies above New York. The pair are matched in terms of power until the fight moves into a nuclear power plant where Sodam Yat's Daxamite physiology causes him to be severely weakened by the lead present in the reactor. As he tries to escape the power plant, Ion is impaled with a lead rod by Prime. His powers diminished by lead poisoning, Sodam Yat is beaten nearly to death by Superman-Prime.

In ''Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Ion'', following the events of the war, The Guardians request Kyle Rayner assist Sodam in adjusting to his new role. While speaking about Sodam's history and attitude as a Lantern, it is revealed that Sodam must now permanently wear a Power Ring (despite his possession of the Ion powers) to prevent the lead in his body from killing him. They are then attacked by [[Nero (DC Comics)|Nero]], who had been freed during the initial assault on Oa but had not participated in the overall Sinestro Corps story. Kyle fights to less than his abilities to encourage Sodam to embrace his status as Ion. Sodam eventually defeats Nero with the exact same strategy that Kyle used when Nero first gained the yellow power ring, before the creation of the Sinestro Corp: seizing control of Nero's own constructs.

Yat continued to wield the power of Ion as a proud servant of the Green Lantern Corps before reigniting Daxam's sun.
