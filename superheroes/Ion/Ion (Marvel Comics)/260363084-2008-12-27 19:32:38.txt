'''Ion''' ('''Violetta Todd'''), is a fictional [[supervillain]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Violetta Todd was born in [[Augusta, Georgia]]. She was the niece of [[World War II]] [[superhero]], the [[Blazing Skull]]. Violetta became a [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and was transformed by an experiment gone wrong, caught in an explosion of electromagnetically charged gas, and transformed into a living cloud of [[ionization|ionized]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and hydrogen gas. This condition has made her bitter, often leading to violent behavior. She battled [[Machine Man]], the [[Human Torch]], and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and was sealed in a cryogenic tube.<ref>''Machine Man'' Vol. 1 #15</ref>

Some time later, she escaped and became a professional criminal.  She later appeared among an army of female superhumans gathered by [[Superia]] as her [[Femizons]]. alongside the other female superhumans, she battled [[Captain America]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>''Captain America'' #389-390</ref>

Ion was later defeated by the [[Whizzer (comics)#Stanley Stewart|Whizzer]] and [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], who brought her back to [[Project Pegasus]].<ref>''Quasar'' #52</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Violetta Todd was transformed into a being of ionized [[hydrogen]] gas by the explosion of an electromagnetically charged gas. She requires a special suit of synthetic stretch fabric incorporating unstable molecules and devices which strengthen and maintain the electromagnetic field which defines her humanoid form. She has the ability to exist as sentient ionized hydrogen gas surrounded by her electromagnetic field, which can be easily disrupted by a sufficiently powerful electric current -- without her special containment suit costume, Ion exists as a formless cloud of ionized gas. Exposure to extreme cold can return Ion to human form.

She has the ability to fire bolts of [[electromagnetic]] energy, the ability to imbue metal objects with electromagnetic energy, and the ability to capture opponents in her electromagnetic field. She also has the ability to control her body and parts thereof in gas form while her head is not solid and her mind only exists in astral form. She is able to manipulate electromagnetic fields, project electromagnetic energy, and levitate herself or objects, as well as sense the atomic composition of matter. 

Violetta Todd has a gifted intellect and a Ph. D. in nuclear physics. She is an extremely gifted nuclear physicist specializing in hydrogen fusion.
