'''Ion''', alias Violetta Todd, is a fictional [[supervillain]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==History==
Violetta was the niece of [[World War II]] [[superhero]], the [[Blazing Skull]]. Violetta became a [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and was transformed by an experiment gone wrong into a living cloud of [[ionization|ionized]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This condition has made her bitter, often leading to violent behavior and conflicts with superheroes.

==Powers and Abilities==
Ion is composed of a cloud of sentient ionized [[hydrogen]] gas. She is able to manipulate [[electromagnetic]] fields and levitate herself or objects, as well as sense the atomic composition of matter. However, her ionized form is easily disrupted by electrical currents, forcing her to wear a special containment suit at all times.
