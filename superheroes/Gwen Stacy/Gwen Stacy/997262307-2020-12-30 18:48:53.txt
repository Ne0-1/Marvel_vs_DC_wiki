'''Gwendolyne Maxine Stacy'''<ref name="middle_name" /> is a [[fictional character]] who appears in American [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as a [[supporting character]] in those featuring [[Spider-Man]]. A college student, she was the first romantic interest for [[Peter Parker]] before she was murdered by the [[Green Goblin]] ([[Norman Osborn]]). Her death has haunted Peter ever since, and stories published long afterwards indicate she still holds a special place in his heart.

The character has been portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in the 2007 film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and by [[Emma Stone]] in the 2012 [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]].'' An [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate reality]] rendition of the character was portrayed by [[Hailee Steinfeld]] in the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early history===
In her initial appearances, Peter Parker met Gwen while both were studying as undergraduates at [[Empire State University]],<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Sanderson |title=The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York City |year=2007 |pages=30–33 |isbn=978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> but with [[Aunt May]] in the hospital, Peter was troubled and ignored her advances. She dated both [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Harry Osborn]] to make Peter jealous. Gradually, however, a romance developed; Gwen, a science major, appreciated Peter's intellect. Their relationship began almost immediately after Peter stopped going out with [[Mary Jane Watson]], whom he began to see as shallow and self-absorbed.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Later issues introduced Gwen's father, NYPD Captain [[George Stacy]]. Though her father was both fond of Peter and supportive of his alter-ego Spider-Man, his death strained Peter's relationship with Gwen after he was killed by falling debris during a battle involving Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #90. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 55: "Captain George Stacy had always believed in Spider-Man and had given him the benefit of the doubt whenever possible. So in Spider-Man's world, there was a good chance that he would be destined to die."</ref> Gwen blamed Spider-Man for his death, and left for Europe to cope with her loss. She wanted Peter to ask her to marry him and convince her to stay, but his guilt stopped him from proposing.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Gwen's feelings for Peter eventually prompted her to return to New York, and their relationship was rekindled.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #98. Marvel Comics.</ref>

According to Lee, who scripted all of the stories featuring Gwen Stacy up to this point, the original intent was for Gwen Stacy to be Spider-Man's central love interest. However, [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s unexpected popularity with readers after her debut changed the course of the plan as fans liked Mary Jane more and demanded for her to be Peter Parker's main love interest instead, and that "no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!"<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisch|first=Sholly|title=The Wedding of the Year|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|pages=12–15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 30|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

===Death===
{{Main|The Night Gwen Stacy Died}}
[[Gerry Conway]] and [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Stan Lee as writer and editor, respectively, of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''. Together with inker [[John Romita, Sr.]], they came to the decision to have Gwen Stacy killed off.<ref name="LeeAmazing32">{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 32|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> It was Romita who first suggested the idea, during a plotting session with Conway when Romita was still penciller on ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref name="CloneGen">{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Gerry|title=Spider-Man: Clone Genesis|date=June 1995|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|isbn=0-7851-0158-6|pages=4–5|chapter=Foreword}}</ref> Conway later said his contribution to the decision was motivated by a desire to bring Mary Jane Watson to the forefront,<ref name="CloneGen"/><ref name="clone69">{{cite journal|last= Veronese|first= Keith|date= October 2010|title= Spider-Man: The Beginnings of the Clone Saga|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 69|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> as he shared Lee's feeling that she was a more interesting character than Gwen Stacy: "[Mary Jane] hadn't lost the edge that made her an interesting character. Gwen didn't have an edge. She was just a nice person".<ref name="Walker 21">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= October 2010|title= Gwen, the Goblin, and the Spider-Fans|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 21|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

In [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121]] (June 1973), the [[Green Goblin]] kidnaps Gwen Stacy and throws her off a bridge (depicted as the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] but described in the text as the [[George Washington Bridge]]).<ref name=saffel65>Saffel, Steve.

Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel implemented it remain controversial among fans because some believe that Peter himself was the one who caused her death. The death became a pivotal point in both Spider-Man's history and in [[American comic book]]s in general. Many point to Gwen's death as the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]].<ref name="Blumberg">{{cite journal| last = Blumberg| first = Arnold T.| date = Fall 2003| title = 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died:' The End of Innocence and the Birth of the Bronze Age| journal = Reconstruction| volume = 3| issue = 4| url = http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| access-date = 2008-11-14| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5mr8ahT2C?url=http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| archive-date = 2010-01-17}}</ref> Before her death, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes did not fail so catastrophically, nor did the hero's loved ones die so suddenly and without warning.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Sanderson|first1 = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 159|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In June [1973], Marvel embarked on a story that would have far-reaching effects.

A note on the letters page of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #125 states: "It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her".<ref name="saffel65"/> The comic book ''Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man'' (2007) concurred that the proximate<!--word is correct; NOT "approximate"--> cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-speed fall. An issue of ''Peter Parker/Spider-Man'' revisits the issue, and further confirms Gwen died of a broken neck due to the use of the webbing.{{issue|date=August 2012}} On the other hand, in the 1987 edition of the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', Gwen's death is attributed to the fall, not to Spider-Man's webbing, though the listed cause of death is still technically true - if she hadn't fallen from the bridge, the event that caused her death couldn't have happened. In his book ''[[The Physics of Superheroes]]'', physicist [[James Kakalios]] confirms that, consistent with [[Newton's laws of motion]], the sudden stop would have killed Gwen Stacy.<ref>[http://www.it.umn.edu/news/inventing/2002_Spring/superhero.html ''Inventing Tomorrow'' (University of Minnesota Institute of Technology magazine), Spring 2002: "Jim Kakalios enlists the aid of costumed crimefighters to teach critical thinking in an imaginative freshman seminar" by Paul Sorenson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615181025/http://it.umn.edu/news/inventing/2002_Spring/superhero.html |date=2006-06-15}}</ref>

Within the [[Marvel Comics]], Gwen Stacy's death has enormous repercussions. [[Mary Jane Watson]] feels the loss of Gwen deeply and becomes a more mature, compassionate person. Gwen's death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually to romance.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Miles Warren, one of Gwen's professors, was secretly in love with her. Following her death, Warren goes insane and adopts the persona of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Jackal]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the fourth and final issue of the miniseries ''[[Marvels]]'' (April 1994), photographer Phil Sheldon befriends Gwen Stacy, who has absolved Spider-Man of any blame for her father's death. Gwen's simple faith in heroes convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the "Marvels" (i.e., superheroes)—to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to praise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. When the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage to bait Spider-Man, Sheldon frantically follows the resulting chase in a taxi and witnesses her death. While it is reported that she died from the shock of the fall, Sheldon thinks it looks like something else. Sheldon's faith in the Marvels is shattered.<ref>''Marvels'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Clones===
Following the publication of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121, Stan Lee (who had since become Marvel's publisher) was frequently criticized by fans during his public appearances for killing off Gwen Stacy.<ref name="clone69"/> Lee, who had also found the character's death objectionable,<ref name="LeeAmazing32"/> insisted that Conway write a story bringing her back.<ref name="clone69"/> Conway strongly objected since he felt any sort of resurrection would break the plausibility of the stories, but ultimately gave in under the condition that after reviving Gwen, he could write her out of the book as soon as he wanted.<ref name="Walker 21"/> He decided that cloning would be the best means to bring the character back.

In the resulting story, set approximately two years after Gwen Stacy's death,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_giant_size/005.html|title=SpiderFan.org - Comics : Giant-Size Spider-Man #5|website=www.spiderfan.org}}</ref> "Gwen" reappears, perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time since her death. This story, published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 (May 1975), initiated the [[Clone Saga#The original Clone Saga|original Clone Saga]]. At the end of that story, Gwen's clone, a creation of Spider-Man villain the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], leaves to find a new life for herself, coming to accept that she is not really the same person who had a relationship with Peter Parker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 1988 crossover "[[The Evolutionary War]]", the [[High Evolutionary]], who had once been Miles Warren's teacher, captures Gwen's clone. He determines that Warren had actually not perfected the process, and instead injected a young woman with a genetic virus carrying Gwen's DNA, turning her into a copy of Gwen. After a subsequent altercation of Spider-Man and the [[List of deities in Marvel Comics#Young Gods|Young Gods]] against the High Evolutionary's Purifiers, this woman is purged of the virus by the Young Goddess Daydreamer.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Vol.1 #8 (November 1988). Marvel Comics.</ref> This is later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]], with the High Evolutionary stating that Warren had in fact succeeded in perfecting his own cloning technique, and Daydreamer had accidentally given the Gwen clone a false new life under the name of Joyce Delaney.<ref>''Scarlet Spider Unlimited'' Vol.1 #1 (November 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the second "[[Clone Saga]]", Joyce, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker's book of Spider-Man photos, ''Webs'', and remembers (to an extent) her real history. She returns to New York City, but after helping Spider-Man and [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] fight the Jackal, she again disappears from Spider-Man's life.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #61: "Heading Toward Omega" (August 1995) and ''Spider-Man: Maximum Clonage Omega'' (August 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> She makes herself a new life in London, but is murdered years later by the Gwen Stacy clone known as Abby-L.<ref>''Spider-Island Deadly Foes'' #1 (October 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Another Gwen clone appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (March 1995). This clone believes she is the real Gwen. She dies from clone degeneration in ''Spider-Man'' #56 (March 1995), the next issue of the story arc.

A further Gwen clone appears in the "Sibling Rivalry" crossover storyline between ''[[Superior Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Spider]]''. She joins the Jackal (alongside [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] and a regular Miles Warren clone) in capturing [[Superior Spider-Man]] and [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is sympathetic towards "Peter" and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal to the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal's lab is engulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is seemingly consumed by the fire.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' (Vol. 2) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy''===
In the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, a flashback revealed that Gwen Stacy was conscious during Spider-Man and Green Goblin's battle on the bridge, and as she was falling to her death. She overheard their conversation and discovered Peter is Spider-Man in the process. She was angry at Peter for keeping this secret and for his involvement in her father's death.<ref name="clone conspiracy 1">''The Clone Conspiracy #1''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the present, Gwen is supposedly revived by the [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] with his clones. The Jackal claims that this one is not a clone but the real Gwen who was harvested and reanimated from her remains and still has all her memories, including those of her death. The Jackal offers Gwen the opportunity to be his business partner as he tries to change the world with his new technology. Gwen is hesitant about this new life at first but accepts it when the Jackal shows that he has reanimated the clone of her father, who is in much better health than he was before he died.<ref name="clone conspiracy 1"/> When Spider-Man arrives at the incorporation and discovers the Jackal's experiments, he is surprised by Gwen's presence and notes that unlike the other people the Jackal revived, who were all clones, Gwen does not trigger his spider sense, making him wonder if she was the real one. He is attacked by the "reborn" [[Doctor Octopus]] before he can question the issue further.<ref name="clone conspiracy 1"/>

After the Jackal breaks up the fight and shows Spider-Man around the New U, the George Stacy clone recognizes something off about Gwen's face and points his gun at her. It is revealed that the Gwen clone was actually her Earth-65 counterpart [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]] who assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen is kidnapped by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and taken to [[Parker Industries]] to be studied. Kaine reveals that he and Spider-Woman came to this Earth to assist Spider-Man because they saw that Spider-Man agreeing with the Jackal's offer on other worlds always results in a global disaster.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rhino and Electro are sent to retrieve Gwen after attacking the staff, but Gwen tells them to take Kaine with him too because his condition could help with Jackal's experiments. [[Anna Maria Marconi]] also volunteers to come with because she has studied both Kaine and the drug.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Spider-Man is taken to Haven, he catches up with Gwen in the household in the facility, where she tries to convince him to support New U Technologies. Peter still has a hard time believing she is the real Gwen given his other experiences with clones. Gwen tries justifying her existence by telling Peter her memories, including how she overheard the Green Goblin talking to Spider-Man before her death. Peter thinks she died hating him, but Gwen said that she did not hate him, but rather died feeling betrayed. Peter again still has doubts towards Gwen not being a clone. She tries kissing him, to no avail which only pushes him to put the mask back on. Gwen witnesses Jackal order the cloned villains to kill Spider-Man and decides to help Peter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Doctor Octopus pulls a switch that activates the Carrion Virus in all of the revived, including Gwen and George, and causes them to start rapidly decaying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Gwen's father deteriorates in her arms, she assists Spider-Man by helping him get to the lab. When the cloned villains get to the lab doors, Gwen locks Spider-Man inside the lab and sacrifices herself to give him more time. Following the Carrion Virus being thwarted, Spider-Man and Anna check the building and see that Gwen has been reduced to dust.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Harry Osborn#Kindred|Kindred]] later visited the cemetery where Gwen Stacy and George Stacy were buried. He exhumed their bodies and placed them around the table at his hideout while awaiting for Spider-Man to find him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Spider-Man finally confronts Kindred, Gwen and George's corpses were sat around a dinner table alongside the exhumed bodies of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], [[Flash Thompson]], J. Jonah Jameson Sr., [[Jean DeWolff]], and Marla Jameson.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #51. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==

==="Age of Apocalypse"===
In the two-issue mini-series ''X-Universe'', which details what happened to the rest of the Marvel Universe during the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, the Green Goblin never killed Gwen Stacy. Instead she became the bodyguard of Donald Blake, who, in this reality, had never become [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|the Mighty Thor]]. Sometime later in the mainstream universe in X-Man #37, the Age of Apocalypse version of Gwen is pulled from her reality to the mainstream Earth's George Washington Bridge, much to Spider-Man's shock.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

==="House of M"===
In the reality seen in the "[[House of M]]" storyline, in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans, Gwen was never killed. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist – and had a decidedly hostile relationship with chemical weapon developer [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man's life story. Gwen and her father read textual accounts of their deaths in the main universe, though they believe this simply to be the morbid imaginings of Peter Parker, who is suffering from mental health issues.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #1-3 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Adventures''===
Gwen Stacy first appeared in ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' #53 as a new student of Midtown High. She had transferred from her previous school after the Torino Gang, a powerful New York mob, began harassing her in an attempt to keep her father, police captain George Stacy, from arresting members of their gang. However, the Torinos continued to harass Gwen at Midtown, prompting Spider-Man to help the police take down the gang.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #55. Marvel Comics.</ref> Like her father, Gwen believes Spider-Man is a hero. She subsequently began participating in a "Spider-Man Appreciation Society" designed to foster better public opinion of Spider-Man.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gwen is also attracted to Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker; although she openly flirted with him, Peter began dating a different girl, [[Sophia "Chat" Sanduval]], which made Gwen very unhappy.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Gwen was brainwashed by [[Emma Frost]] into believing ''she'' was dating Peter. Gwen's brainwashing wore off (or was undone by Emma), but Gwen now believes her relationship with Peter ended when he chose Chat over her,<ref>''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> causing her to treat Chat very coldly. She has since warmed to Chat, however.<ref>''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Recently, Gwen began a close friendship with Carter Torino who is the grandson of the head of the Torino Gang.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Their relationship is complicated by the fact Gwen's father is still trying to take down Carter's criminal family.<ref>''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies Return''===
In the limited series, ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', Gwen of 'Earth Z' is still a college student out with her friends Mary Jane and Harry Osborn. The zombified Spider-Man travels to this earth and, despite his best intentions, turns the [[Sinister Six]]. They then slay and partly consume Gwen and her friends. To stop the spread of the virus, Spider-Man obliterates the bodies.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #1 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Powerless''===
In the ''Powerless'' mini-series, Gwen Stacy again appears as the girlfriend of Peter Parker. Norman Osborn again kidnaps and attempts to kill her as a part of a plan to intimidate Peter. In a twist, the powerless Peter (with a limb crippled from a spider bite) manages to save Gwen from falling to her death.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===''Spider-Gwen''===

{{Main|Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)}}
In the alternate reality designated Earth-65, Gwen Stacy is the one bitten by the radioactive spider, and becomes a superhero going by the name of [[Spider-Woman#Gwen Stacy|Spider-Woman]]. She is also a member of a band fronted by Mary Jane Watson, simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after Gwen begins fighting crime, Peter Parker, her best friend attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him, becoming this universe's version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her father, who is also a police chief in this world, begins a hunt for her. This follows Gwen into college, where she is still a member of the Mary Janes. At a gig of theirs, an assassin is sent after Gwen's father, who is in the audience. Gwen defeats the assassin, the audience and band clearing out during the battle. While they are alone, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen taking off her mask to reveal who she is. Shocked upon learning Spider-Woman's identity, he tells her to run before he changes his mind. In the distance, the Captain Britain from Earth-833, called Spider-UK, is watching, saying that Gwen will "do quite nicely".<ref>''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gwen is recruited by Spider-UK to team up with other Spider-Totems across the multiverse, and next appears on Earth-616 with Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4 and [[Bullet Points (comics)|Spider-Man of Earth-70105]] (who in that reality is [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]) to rescue [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]], who was under attack by the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Marvel-616 Peter is hesitant to put Gwen in action and she is told by the others of how he failed to save her in his world. However he does recruit her for a mission and they both agree to look out for each other.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gwen is sent to recruit an alternate version of Peter Parker who is driven insane after he failed to save the Gwen Stacy in his dimension, killed the Green Goblin, and became the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]. She tells him that he can become the man he once was if he joins them, but they are attacked by the Inheritors. Hobgoblin sacrifices himself to save Gwen.<ref>''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the events of ''Spider-Verse'', Gwen returns to her home of Earth-65 where she continues her career as Spider-Woman in her own solo series, ''Spider-Gwen''. She first saves George Stacy from mercenary [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]] who was sent by [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and his lawyer [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] to target him.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #1</ref> Then she begins a hunt for the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] who has been terrorizing the city in her absence.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #2.</ref>

She appears as one of the main characters in the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' ''Spider-Verse'' event with [[Spider-Ham]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], [[Spider-UK]], [[Spider-Man Noir]], and [[Spider-Man India]] in a Battleworld called Archania ruled by Norman Osborn. They eventually form a team called the Web Warriors where they help other Spider-Men and Women in various dimensions. A child version of her also appears in ''Giant Size Little Marvel Avengers vs X-Men'' as a new kid that Tony Stark tries to ask out on a date. She rejects him because he's a kid with a goatee and mustache. Another version of her is a member of Arcadia's's [[A-Force]]. On Earth-8, she is married to Miles Morales and they have two children with Spider Powers.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #18.</ref>

In an issue of Web Warriors, [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Spider-Punk]] mentions that the Gwen Stacy in his dimension was a musical icon.<ref>''Web Warriors'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Man: Fairy Tales''===

===''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane''===
Gwen Stacy first appears at the end of ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' #5. She is the new girl at school and quickly becomes close friends with Peter Parker. In ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' #9, Peter and Gwen take their relationship to the next level by sharing a tender kiss, much to the dismay of [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]].

===''Spider-Man: Life Story''===
''Spider-Man: Life Story'' features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Gwen discovers that Peter is Spider-Man when she sees his costume underneath Peter's shirt at the train station shortly after Flash was deployed to Vietnam. She eventually marries Peter and becomes Chief Biologist for Miles Warren's bio-engineering company. In 1977, Harry Osborn's attack on Warren's company as the Black Goblin revealed that Miles created clones of Norman Osborn, Peter, and Gwen. Harry blows up the containment tubes containing the clones which kills all of them except for Peter's clone. However, Miles reveals that the "Gwen" Peter was with was actually her clone; he abducted the real Gwen with the intention of attempting to win her over later, with the result that the real Gwen died in the explosion. A year later, Peter and Gwen's clones rename themselves as Ben and Helen Parker and move out of New York for a second chance at life, the clone's relationship with the original Peter apparently not surviving the revelation of her clone status.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #1-2</ref> She apparently died at some point before the 1990s, at which point Peter's clone Ben was convinced that he was the original and Peter allowed him to take over so that he could 'retire' as Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Gwen Stacy first appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #14 (December 2001) as a teenage girl at Peter's high school.

''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra!]]''. p. 110.</ref> has amber eyes, wears punk-style clothing, and harbors a rebellious personality.<ref name="bagley-eyes">In an interview in [[Wizard Magazine]] #180 (2006), [[Mark Bagley]] remarked there were some "coloring issues" in Gwen's first appearances. He did not intend her eyes to be yellow.</ref> In her first appearance she gives a rousing speech on 'super powers'; in the next issue she pulls a knife on [[Kenny McFarlane|Kong]], a classmate who was bullying [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter]]. She is suspended from school temporarily. Gwen becomes friends with Peter, which leads Mary Jane Watson to believe Gwen is vying for his affections.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gwen is later taken in by [[Aunt May#Ultimate Marvel|Aunt May]] after her father, police captain John Stacy, is killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume and her estranged mother does not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house creates more tension between Peter and Mary Jane, and leads to their temporary break-up. Peter's relationship with Gwen is further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blames for her father's death. When Peter finds his friend [[Eddie Brock]], Gwen confides in him about her feelings of isolation. Eddie then tries to kiss her and Gwen is shocked.{{issue|date=July 2013}} When she eventually learns Peter is Spider-Man, the angry Gwen pulls her father's gun on him. He manages to convince her he is not to blame for her father's death. Gwen runs off but returns, explaining she is just really mad at everything at the moment. She wouldn't have really shot him, a fact Peter already knew because his spider sense didn't go off despite Gwen's wrath. Gwen then agrees to keep his secret.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gwen Stacy dies in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #62. Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her she never had romantic feelings for Peter. She considered him just as a friend. She is killed by [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]], a vampiric monster made by the splicing of [[genetics|genetic]] material from Peter Parker, his father, and [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Dr. Curt Connors]]. Although Peter is not in the area when she dies, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation. His guilt makes him decide to retire as Spider-Man for a while. Eventually, he takes up his hero identity when his responsibility for the innocent becomes too great to overlook.{{issue|date=July 2013}} At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen's death. [[Flash Thompson#Ultimate Marvel|Flash Thompson]] makes an off-color remark about Gwen's passing. It infuriates MJ to the point where she physically attacks Flash. It is revealed Flash had a crush on Gwen all along.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

A girl seeming to be Gwen Stacy appears in ''Ultimate Spider-Man #98''. Says ''Ultimate artist'' [[Mark Bagley]], "Gwen’s return is integral to the Clone storyline and is basically a way to rock Peter's world...again".{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm "Wizard Universe"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122065848/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm |date=January 22, 2008}}</ref> In this issue "Gwen" appears to have no memory of her "death" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages "Gwen". She transforms into what appears to be Carnage before leaping out the window.{{issue|date=July 2013}} In the next issue, "[[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]" claims "Gwen" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]]. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayer drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue #113, Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin causes a massive prison break from the Triskelion. An inmate appearing to be 'Gwen' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run. After "devouring" Gwen, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her "essence" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy.{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[http://www.ign.com/comics/ultimate-spider-man "Ultimate Spider-Man Pictures Full Size"]. [[IGN]].</ref>

During the "War of the Symbiotes" storyline, Gwen/Carnage's back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with Tony Stark. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker's house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage's face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Venom on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After a series of tests, it is concluded that this Gwen is not a clone but consciously and genetically is the genuine article now reborn (though Gwen's original body died, the Carnage symbiote absorbed her being and they had bonded since her death). After S.H.I.E.L.D. intervenes, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen's life. Her ghastly experience with the Carnage symbiote also causes her to develop a death anxiety she gradually controls. Six months after the "Ultimatum" storyline, in ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #1, Gwen is living with the Parkers again and seems to be dating Peter. However, circumstances involving the Chameleon made Gwen realize she made a mistake dating Peter. She breaks up with him, but still lives with the Parkers due to Gwen and Aunt May has become close in a surrogate mother-daughter fashion.

After Peter's death, Gwen and May re-located in [[France]], but returned to New York after hearing about the re-emergence of a [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|new Spider-Man]], Miles Morales.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #11.

Early in the series, ''Ultimate Spider-Man #25'' (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy's death in the [[Earth-616]] continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved. The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead. The cliffhanger was resolved in the next issue when Mary Jane awoke in #26, uninjured.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Film===
====Sam Raimi series====
* A student in Peter Parker's university class in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', portrayed by an uncredited [[Extra (acting)|extra]], is identified as Gwen Stacy in the film's novelization.
* Gwen Stacy is portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In this film's version, she is [[Eddie Brock|Eddie]]’s one-time [[Romantic interest|love interest]] before [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s, serving as an unintended rival to [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Gwen is a classmate and lab partner of Peter. Spider-Man rescues her early in the film from a construction crane accident during her modeling shoot. She later kisses an upside-down Spider-Man in a public ceremony similar fashion to how Mary Jane did in the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|first film]]'' which causes Mary Jane to become angry and hurt. As Peter is at the top of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Connors]]'s [[quantum mechanics]] class, he tutors Gwen, who considers Peter a [[genius]] and is very fond of him. Gwen was also friends with Eddie since he took pictures of her so she could be a model. They went on a single date before Peter, under the influence of the symbiote, steals Gwen from Eddie. He dances with her at the same jazz club where Mary Jane works, but Gwen realizes Peter is doing this to make Mary Jane jealous. Upset about this, Gwen apologizes to Mary Jane and storms out of the club, leaving Peter behind. She is later present at [[Harry Osborn]]'s funeral.
* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] said she would love to be a part of any continuation of the film franchise, while acknowledging her character's opportunity may have passed, especially after ''Spider-Man 3'' ended with Peter and Mary Jane once again in each other's arms. In May 2007, actor [[James Cromwell]], who played Captain Stacy in the film stated he thought the natural progression for the character would be for both to die early in ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'', mirroring the comics. Howard said a death would not have bothered her. The film was ultimately unmade, although Stacy was in the draft.

===''The Refrigerator Monologues''===
Gwen Stacy is recast as Paige Embry in ''[[The Refrigerator Monologues]]''. She is the unofficial leader of the Hell Hath Club, a group of women in the afterlife trying to cope with the brutal termination of their plot lines, and provides connecting narration for each of their stories. She loved wearing her lab coat and feels unhappy about being stuck in the clothes she was buried in.

Paige was a science intern with a nurse for a mother and a garbageman for a father. She snuck her boyfriend, Tom Thatcher, into her lab one night to show him an experimental form of "hypermecury" that she had helped design for the military. Despite Paige's precautions, Tom was exposed to hypermercury and became Kid Mercury, a Spiderman/Flash parody. He started working as a superhero, and Paige destroyed almost all of the hypermercury to prevent unworthy people from gaining his powers.

Their music theory teacher discovered their secret and tried to force Paige to give him the last remaining sample of hypermercury. Despite Tom and Paige's efforts, he took the hypermercury and became Dr. Nocturne, a Lizard/Doctor Ocotpus parody. When Paige tried to take him down, he tossed her off a bridge, and her neck broke from an abrupt stop in Tom's arms. She woke up in a garbage dump in Deadtown, but soon integrated herself into the community.

The frozen nature of her ghostly existence means she cannot stop loving Tom, even though she knows that he has moved on. However, Paige has grown to enjoy her life in "Deadtown," her name for the afterlife, although she is bitter about being sacrificed in the name of Kid Mercury's character development. She lives in an apartment building with a slam-poetry-loving gargoyle on the balcony, and has Odysseus (whom she thinks is a dick) for an upstairs neighbor.

Due to the popularity of [[Spider-Gwen]], in June 2015 Marvel published variant covers for 20 of their current series, which saw Gwen Stacy re-imagined as other Marvel characters, such as [[Doctor Strange]], [[Groot]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/24438/gwen_takes_over|title=GWEN TAKES OVER|publisher=Marvel|date=14 April 2015|access-date=5 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827021439/http://marvel.com/news/comics/24438/gwen_takes_over|archive-date=27 August 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> One of those variants, for "Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars #2", featured an amalgam of the design of Gwen Stacy and [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]] dubbed "[[Gwenpool]]", which turned out to be especially popular with the fans.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rich |last= Johnston |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/08/21/and-finally-has-marvel-noticed-that-gwenpool-is-a-thing-now/|title=And Finally… Has Marvel Noticed That Gwenpool Is A Thing Now?R|publisher=Bleeding Cool |date= August 21, 2015}}</ref> As the result, Marvel produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, a backup story in the series "[[Howard the Duck]]", and a one-shot "Gwenpool Holiday Special #1",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-announces-gwenpool-one-shot-howard-the-duck-back-up-stories|title=MARVEL ANNOUNCES "GWENPOOL HOLIDAY SPECIAL", "HOWARD THE DUCK" BACKUP STORIES|publisher=Comicbookresources |date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> with ''Howard the Duck'' #1 establishing that her name is actually "[[Gwen Poole]]", not Gwen Stacy, or even an alternate version of either Gwen Stacy or Wade Wilson. Following the publication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' by the same creative team was announced, starting in April 2016.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/21/marvel-announces-gwenpool|title=Marvel announces new Gwenpool series|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>
