'''Gwendolyn "Gwen" Stacy'''<ref name="name" /> is a [[supporting character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]’ [[Spider-Man]] series. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], she first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31 (December 1965).

A [[blonde]] college co-ed, Gwen was the first true love of Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]). Gwen was killed by the [[Green Goblin]] in [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121]] (June 1973). Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel implemented it are controversial among fans, but it is still a pivotal point in both Spider-Man’s history and in [[American comic books]] in general. Spider-Man writers and fans disagree about who is the character’s “one true love,” Gwen or his subsequent wife [[Mary Jane Watson]]. 

==Fictional character history==
===Background===
Gwen first appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 (December 1965); Peter Parker meets Gwen while they are undergraduates at [[Empire State University]]. Initially, with Aunt May in the hospital, Peter is troubled and ignores her advances, and in return, she feels insulted by his aloofness. She dates both Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn while pining for Peter. Gradually, however, a romance develops; Gwen, a science major, seems to appreciate Peter's intellectual personality, different from that of jocks like [[Flash Thompson]] and [[preppies]] like [[Harry Osborn]]. She is Peter Parker's first true love.

Their relationship almost ended as it started. A mind controlled Captain Stacy got into a fight with Peter, which Gwen observed. Thinking Peter attacked her father, the relationship was halted. Gwen eventually learned the truth and she and Peter reconciled. Peter would frequently feel insecure whenever she saw Flash Thompson with Gwen, and many misunderstanding ensued. 

Their romance becomes more complicated when her father, Police Captain [[George Stacy]], is killed by falling debris from a battle which involved Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus]] (''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #90). Gwen blames Spider-Man for that event, which sets back their relationship for a while. Gwen leaves for Europe to deal with her loss. She tries to get Peter to propose to her and convince her to stay, but his guilt stops him from doing so. By the time he changes her mind, she is already gone. 

Peter goes to London to see Gwen, but has to go into action as Spider-Man. Realizing she will put two and two together if she sees Peter and Spider-Man in London, Peter leaves without seeing Gwen. Gwen eventually realizes she was wrong to pressure Peter into marriage, so she returns to New York and they get back together.

The two start planning their future together and even discuss marriage a few times. Unfortunately, a funeral was to come before a wedding.

===The Death of Gwen Stacy ===
{{main|The Night Gwen Stacy Died}}
[[Image:DeathOfGwenStacyCover.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Trade-paperback reprint collection, ''The Death of Gwen Stacy''.<br>Art by [[J.G. Jones]].]]
In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121 (June 1973), "[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]" by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and penciller [[Gil Kane]], Gwen Stacy is held captive on a tower of the [[George Washington Bridge]] by the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, who is aware that Peter Parker is Spider-Man). Spider-Man arrives to fight the Green Goblin, and when the Goblin throws Gwen Stacy off the bridge, Spider-Man catches her by her leg with a string of web. He initially thinks he has saved her, but when he pulls her back onto the bridge, he realizes she is dead. Peter is unsure whether the whiplash from her sudden stop broke her neck or if the fall killed her, but he blames himself for her death regardless. (The Goblin does state that a fall from that height would kill anyone, but this has been refuted; see Kakalios, below). In shock and anger, Spider-Man nearly kills the Green Goblin in retaliation, but in the end chooses not to do so. The Goblin still seemingly dies when he is impaled by his own Goblin Glider in an attempt to kill Spider-Man, and would not return for nearly three hundred issues.

The death of Gwen Stacy had an enormous impact in the world of comic-book fandom.<ref>[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm The Night Gwen Stacy Died: The End of Innocence and the Birth of the Bronze Age]</ref> Before her, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes simply did not fail so catastrophically; nor did a loved one of the superhero die so suddenly, without warning, or so violently. Because of this, some fans and historians take the death of Gwen Stacy as one marker of the end of the period they refer to as the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].

Physicist James Kakalios shows in his book ''[[The Physics of Superheroes]]'' that, consistent with [[Newton's laws of motion]], it was the sudden stop that killed Gwen Stacy.<ref>[http://www.it.umn.edu/news/inventing/2002_Spring/superhero.html ''Inventing Tomorrow'' (University of Minnesota Institute of Technology magazine), Spring 2002: "Jim Kakalios enlists the aid of costumed crimefighters to teach critical thinking in an imaginative freshman seminar", by  Paul Sorenson]</ref> The comic book ''Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man'' (2007) concurred that the proximate<!--word is correct; NOT "approximate"--> cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-velocity fall.  An issue of Peter Parker/Spider-Man revisits the issue, and further confirms that Gwen died due to an unforseen error on Spider-Man's part: his webbing, at that time, was designed specifically for use by Spider-Man (who had increased strength that allowed him to handle the high-velocity falls that he routinely faced) -- but Gwen Stacy's neck snapped from the sudden jolt.

During a recent battle with the [[Sinister Twelve]], the Green Goblin captures Mary Jane and takes her to another bridge, throwing her over the side just as he had Gwen; however, this time Peter is able to save MJ by using multiple web-strands, catching Mary Jane by every major joint in the body and thus providing her with enough support to avoid any fatal injuries. <ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

===After death===
Gwen Stacy’s death has enormous repercussions. [[Mary Jane Watson]], a close friend of Gwen Stacy, is deeply affected by Gwen's death; she becomes more serious of matters at hand. Gwen's death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually a romantic relationship. The Green Goblin's status in Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]] is much elevated by his murder of Gwen Stacy. Before the death of Gwen Stacy, Doctor Octopus had seemed to be Spider-Man's primary archnemesis, but Gwen's death pushed the Green Goblin into that role.

Furthermore, the [[Punisher]], who would go on to become an important character in the Marvel Universe since his [[first appearance]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #129 (February 1974), was initially created as a character to hunt down Spider-Man. The [[Jackal (Marvel comics)|Jackal]] manipulates The Punisher into believing that Spider-Man killed Gwen Stacy. The Jackal, Miles Warren in disguse, a former professor of Gwen's, was secretly in love with her. Following her death, Warren had grown increasingly insane and adopted the persona of the Jackal; he also became obsessed with Gwen.

In the fourth and final issue of the miniseries ''Marvels'' (April 1994), photographer Phil Sheldon befriends Gwen Stacy, who has absolved Spider-Man of any blame for her father's death. Gwen's simple faith in heroes, demonstrated during a brief Atlantean invasion of Manhattan, convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the Marvels - beyond petty human jealousies and spite, they genuinely exist to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to praise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. Unfortunately, Gwen is kidnapped by the [[Green Goblin]] and held hostage to ensure that Spider-Man will challenge him. Sheldon, frantically following the resulting chase in a taxi, arrives at the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in time to see Spider-Man fight the Goblin - and to see Gwen accidentally knocked off the bridge and killed, despite (and tragically because of) Spider-Man's desperate attempt to save her. Sheldon's faith in the Marvels is shattered, as Sheldon cannot reconcile Spider-Man's failure to save Gwen with what he sees as the purpose of the heroes. Sheldon decides that he's done enough and retires - but not before passing on the body of his work to his assistant Marcie.

===Clone===
Approximately two years after her death,<ref>http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_giant_size/005.html</ref> Gwen Stacy reappears, perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time since her death. The Jackal has managed to create a clone of Gwen, and uses her as part of a plot against Spider-Man in the [[Clone Saga#The original Clone Saga|original Clone Saga]]. At the end of that story, Gwen’s clone leaves to find a new life for herself.

In the 1988 crossover "[[The Evolutionary War]]", Gwen's clone is captured by the [[High Evolutionary]], who had once been Miles Warren's teacher. The High Evolutionary is determined to discover how Warren had been able to perfect cloning. In the process, he discovers that Warren had not, but had instead created a genetic virus (the "carrion virus") that transforms already living beings.

Spider-Man investigates Warren's old laboratory and discovers that [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] had in fact been a genetic weapon created by Warren. Another former student of Warren's, Malcolm McBride, is infected with the virus and becomes the second Carrion.

The High Evolutionary tells Spider-Man that this Gwen Stacy is in fact not a clone but a woman named Joyce Delaney whom Warren had altered. Beautiful Dreamer, a follower of the High Evolutionary, is said to restore Delaney's memories, but later events suggest that the High Evolutionary had lied and Delaney never existed.

During the second [[Clone Saga]], Gwen Stacy's clone, now married to a clone of Prof. Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker's book of Spider-Man photos, ''Webs'', and remembers (to an extent) her real history, and returns to New York City. During this storyline, she again disappears from Spider-Man's life.

In many of her appearances, Gwen Stacy's clone has appeared somewhat confused by her contradictory and bizarre memories.

====Other clones====
Another Gwen clone is created and introduced in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (March 1995).  This clone believes she is the real Gwen. She is killed in ''Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #56 (March 1995), the next issue of the story arc. 

In ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' vol.3, #0 (December 1998), it is revealed that the evil geneticist [[Arnim Zola]] obtained samples of the DNA of various superhumans for cloning purposes. These experiments, discovered by the mercenary Deadpool, also include four clones of Gwen Stacy. Zola allows Deadpool to take the four Gwens to his San Francisco base of operations, where they serve and entertain him. They later died in a plane crash.<ref>http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/corpsecorps.htm#Gwen</ref>

===Spider-Man: Blue===
[[Image:Deadgirl gwen.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Gwen, Dead Girl, and Mockingbird in the afterlife.  ''Dead Girl'' #1, art by [[Mike Allred]].]]
Gwen and, to a lesser extent, Mary Jane, are the focus of the critically-acclaimed ''Spider-Man: Blue'', a 2002 [[limited series]] by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] that retells the beginning of Peter's relationship with the two women.  

The [[frame narrative]] has Peter, several years after her death, on [[Valentine's Day]] recording a voice "letter" to his dead love.

===Dead Girl===
In the 2006 [[limited series]] ''[[X-Statix]] Presents: Dead Girl'', Gwen, along with [[Moira MacTaggert]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], are in [[Heaven]], where they are members of the Dead Sisters' [[Book discussion club|Book Club]]. They assist [[Doctor Strange]], [[Dead Girl]], and a small group of dead heroes on a mission to the lower depths of [[Hell]].

===''Sins Past'' and ''Sins Remembered''===
<!--Please do not enhance the word "controversial". Example: do not edit the article to read "In the EXTREMELY controversial story" or anything to that effect. Aside from that, just try to maintain unbiased ([[NPOV]]). Happy editing!-->

The story arc "Sins Past" by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514 (August 2004 - January 2005) reveals that [[Norman Osborn]], the Green Goblin's alter ego, fathered twins, a boy and a girl, with Gwen Stacy, to whom she gave birth while in [[France]] shortly before her death. She vowed she would raise them with Peter and, seeing Norman's disregard for his sick son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], refused to allow Norman access to them.

Seeing her as a threat to his potential heirs, the Green Goblin killed Gwen Stacy. Norman Osborn then raised Gwen's two children, a boy and a girl named Gabriel and Sarah. Due to Norman's enhanced blood, the twins aged about 2-3 times faster than normal and became adults within the span of a few years (they are speculated to be between 5 to 9 years old). Osborn told them that Peter was really their father and was responsible for their mother's death.
[[Image:AmazingSpiderMan511Cover.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Cover of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #511 depicting Sarah, Gwen Stacy's daughter. Art by Mike Deodato Jr.]]
The twins then attack Spider-Man, and he subsequently deduces their true identities. However, seeking to confirm it, Peter goes to Gwen's grave and digs up a sample of her DNA to compare to the twin's DNA which was obtained from the envelope of a letter they had sent him. Spider-Man tells Mary Jane about his initial encounter with Gabriel and Sarah, whereupon Mary Jane reveals that she knew about Norman's involvement with Gwen and tells all to Peter. She has kept it from him all these years because Gwen was distraught and begged her not to say anything. By the story's end, Peter has told the twins the truth. Sarah believes Peter — concluding that he would never have dug up Gwen's grave to acquire a DNA sample if he thought there was even a chance that ''he'' was their father — but Gabriel does not. Gabriel takes the Green Goblin formula and briefly becomes the Grey Goblin. His glider explodes when it is shot by Sarah and he washes up on a beach with no memory of what happened.

A follow-up story to "Sins Past" was published in ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) issues #23-26 (December 2004-March 2005), titled "Sins Remembered" written by Samm Barnes with art by Scot Eaton. Spinning directly out of the events of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514, Spider-Man locates Sarah in [[Paris]], were Sarah has her brother (suffering from [[amnesia]]) restrained in her home. With the help of Spider-Man and [[Interpol]], Sarah helps build a case against a criminal called [[Dupres]] in exchange for the governments help with her rapid-aging disease which is causing her and Gabrial severe headaches. However, during this time Gabrial escapes Sarah and Spider-Man and has yet to be seen again. This [[story arc]] was later collected as a [[trade paperback]] in 2005 as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Vol. 5: Sins Remembered'' (ISBN 0-7851-1628-1).

====Development of "Sins Past"====
Straczynski later stated that he originally wanted Peter Parker to be the father of Gwen's kids but the editors [[veto]]ed the idea. They felt that it would age Peter Parker too much if he had two adult children. It was then decided by the whole creative and editorial team that Norman Osborn would be the father.<ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/rage/111497451826808.htm SBC.com (no date): All the Rage (column) - "Don't Panic", by Blair Marnell & John Voulieris]</ref>

A seeming discrepancy is established in several earlier stories, including "Spider-Man: Revenge of the Green Goblin" (2002), in that Norman Osborn refers to Harry Osborn as his "only son", while "Sins Past" reveals that he has twin heirs. Osborn says "I have no heir, my son is dead...and my grandson Normie is much too young to carry on my stead."

In an apparent chronological discrepancy, Mary Jane Watson says in #512, "Gwen had barely gotten back into town when we found out that [[Harry Osborn]] had overdosed on [[LSD]]", while the original story depicts Stacy back for over 20 issues' worth of time and events prior to Osborn's overdose. However, JMS reasons that because #116-118 were a slightly modified reprint of [[Spectacular Spider-Man]] Magazine #1, those three months are "unaccounted" for; a blank slate in chronology terms.<ref>http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17213</ref><ref>http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_amazing/117.html</ref> <ref>http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_amazing/118.html</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the two-issue mini-series X-Universe which detailed what happened to the rest of the Marvel Universe during the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Gwen Stacy was never killed by the Green Goblin but instead became the bodyguard of Donald Blake, who, in this reality, had never become [[the Mighty Thor]]. Gwen proves handy with a rifle.

===House of M===  
{{Main|Spider-Man: House of M}}
In the ''[[House of M]]'' storyline, in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans, Gwen was never killed. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist &ndash; and had a decidedly hostile relationship with [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] developer [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man's life story.

===''Spider-Man: Fairy Tales''===
Issue #1 of ''[[Spider-Man: Fairy Tales]]'' follows the fairy tale of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] is the part of Little Red Riding Hood, and [[Spider-Man|Peter]] is one of the woodsmen. Gwen Stacy has been previously killed by the wolf. 

Issue #4 is an adaption of [[Cinderella]] with Gwen as Princess Gwendolyn. She falls in love with the masked "Prince of Arachne", who is revealed to be Peter Parker, servant to [[Green Goblin|Sir Osborn]], but is killed during a fight between Osborn and Parker.

===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===
Gwen Stacy first appears at the end of ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' #5.

Gwen Stacy is the new girl at school and, as Peter Parker shows her around the school, she quickly becomes close friends with him. [[Mary-Jane Watson]] realizes her feelings for Peter and is about to tell him, when she discovers Gwen and [[Peter]]'s blossoming relationship. She then decides to hide her feelings and doesn't tell Peter. Gwen has provided a rival for his affections. In ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' #9, Peter and Gwen take their relationship to the next level by sharing a tender kiss, much to the dismay of [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]].  They date for a time, though Gwen breaks up with Peter when she learns that Mary Jane is the girl he truly loves. MJ, attempting to fix this, breaks up with Peter and reunites with Harry, but Peter cannot commit to Gwen and she is unwilling to accept him as a friend and not a lover. This Gwen is significantly closer to the "ice queen" portrayal of the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko comics.

===''Spider-Man Unlimited'' Animated Comic===
In the fourth issue of the comic book based on the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series, Spidey encounters a [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of Gwen Stacy. She helps him escape a hidden paradise known as '''The Haven'''.

===Ultimate Gwen Stacy===
[[Image:Gwenstacyultimate.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Ultimate Gwen Stacy.  Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Gwen Stacy first appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #14 (December 2001) as a teenage girl at Peter's high school. In stark contrast to her classic counterpart, Gwen is often strong-willed and rebellious and often dresses in punk style. In this continuity, her eyes are [[amber]]-colored.<ref name="bagley-eyes">In an interview in [[Wizard Magazine]] #180 (2006), [[Mark Bagley]] remarked that there were some "coloring issues" in Gwen's first appearances, and that he did not intend her eyes to be yellow.</ref>

In her first appearance she gives a rousing speech on 'super powers' in today's societies; in the next issue she pulls a knife on [[Kenny McFarlane|Kong]], a classmate who was bullying Peter. She is suspended from school temporarily. Gwen becomes friends with Peter after that (at one point stopping by his house for help after a possible suicide attempt), which leads [[Mary Jane Watson#Ultimate|Mary Jane Watson]] to believe that Gwen is vying for his affections.

Gwen is later taken in by [[Aunt May#Ultimate Aunt May|Aunt May]] after her father, police captain John Stacy, is killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume. Her estranged mother does not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house creates more tension between Peter and Mary Jane, and leads to their temporary break-up. Peter's relationship with Gwen is further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blames for her father's death.  Like Peter, Gwen is an outsider with no friends and she has expressed a desire to be accepted by her peers. When Peter finds his friend [[Venom (Eddie Brock)#Ultimate Venom|Eddie Brock]] from his early childhood days, Gwen confides in him about her feelings of isolation. Eddie then tries to kiss her and Gwen is furious due to the age difference and the fact that Eddie isn't taking the fact that her father has recently passed away into consideration while he pursues her.  Peter returns to their home later that night to find Gwen sitting on the couch in a bad mood. She explains what happened and how she believes Eddie to be a bad person.

Gwen has a lot of pent up anger which she directs at Spider-Man so when she eventually learns that Peter is Spider-Man she is furious and waits all night for him to return home.  When he does, the angry Gwen pulls her father's gun on him. Fortunately, he manages to convince her that he is not to blame for her father's death. Gwen runs off but returns shortly afterwards, apologizing for her behavior. She explains that she is just really mad at everything at the moment and that she wouldn't have really shot him, a fact Peter already knew because his spider sense didn't go off despite Gwen's wrath. Gwen then agrees to keep his secret.

Gwen Stacy dies in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #62. Initially Bendis wanted to avoid killing Gwen Stacy because he felt it would be redundant.  However as time went on Bendis realized she had to die[http://www.fanboyplanet.com/interviews/mc-brianmichaelbendis3.php]. Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her that she never had romantic feelings for Peter, and that she considered him just as a friend (or, in her words, "her superhero little brother"). She is killed by [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage]], a vampiric monster made by the splicing of [[genetics|genetic]] material from Peter Parker, his father, and [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Dr. Curt Connors]]. Although Peter is not in the area when she dies, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation.

[[Image:Ultgwenkilled.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Carnage kills Gwen Stacy in issue #62.]]

At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen's death. [[Flash Thompson#Ultimate Spider-Man|Flash]] makes an off-color remark about Gwen's passing, and it infuriates MJ to the point where she physically attacks Flash.  Peter and Liz try to restrain MJ and calm her down and Kong finds himself involved also, which land the five of them in detention. It is revealed that Flash had a crush on Gwen all along, and he feels bad that he never got the nerve to ask her out. Also, upon cleaning out Gwen's locker, Peter and MJ discover a photo of them smiling with Gwen hanging inside the locker, dating from a time the three skipped school earlier. 

A girl seeming to be Gwen Stacy appears in ''Ultimate Spider-Man #98''. Says ''Ultimate artist'' [[Mark Bagley]], "Gwen’s return is integral to the Clone storyline and is basically a way to rock Peter's world...again."<ref>http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm</ref>
[[Image:Gwen Stacy Return.JPG|thumb|150px|left|The return of Gwen Stacy?]]
The current Gwen has blue eyes, not amber. In this issue "Gwen" appears to have no memory of her "death" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages "Gwen" and she transforms into what appears to be [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]] before leaping out the window. (On a side note, it is revealed as far back as the thoughts page in issue #50 of Ultimate Spider-Man that Gwen would become Carnage.)

In the next issue, "[[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Richard Parker|Richard Parker]]" claims that "Gwen" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]]. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayer drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody.  Later it is revealed that she was taken into custody by Nick Fury, along with the [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]], and it's unknown what's going to happen to her.  Fury telld his leading scientist to "get to work..."

A preview for issue #113 shows Norman Osborn AKA Green Goblin; causing a massive prison break from the Tresikilion. One of the inmates appears to be 'Gwen' and she walks out in the other direction of the other prisoners, disappearing in the shadows. An upcoming arc is titled "War of the Symbiotes", involving the adaptation of the video-game and the return of Venom and Carnage.

Early in the series, ''Ultimate Spider-Man #25'' (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy's death in the [[Earth-616]] continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved.  The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the [[Queensboro Bridge]], and Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead. The cliffhanger was resolved in the next issue when Mary Jane awoke in #26, uninjured.

===What If: ===
At the very end of [[Peter David]]'s "What If: The Other" one-shot, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], now calling himself "Poison", uses part of the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] symbiote attached to him in a resurrection of Gwen Stacy. She takes the appearance of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].

In an earlier ''What If...?'' story, Peter manages to save Gwen by jumping after her rather than catching her with a web-line, allowing him to cushion her from the impact as they hit the water and susbequently give her CPR. In the aftermath of this rescue, he proposes to Gwen after revealing his secret identity to her and, in a subsequent confrontation with the Green Goblin, Norman Osborn finally fights off his evil side when Harry moves to protect him regardless of what he's become. However, their life is not destined to be a happy one; to ensure his victory, the Goblin has sent [[J. Jonah Jameson]] proof of Spider-Man's real identity, which Jonah has susbequently published and used to acquire a warrant for Peter's arrest, thus forcing Peter to escape from the police mere moments after his wedding to Gwen. As the issue ends, Gwen departs with [[Joe 'Robbie' Robertson]], who promises Gwen that they will do whatever they can to help Peter.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Spider-Man: The Animated Series====
[[Image:Stacyanimated.png‎|thumb|right|Gwen Stacy in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
Gwen was deliberately excluded from the 1990s [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|animated series]], as the creators felt they could neither allow her to live nor deliberately include a character who was going to die. As in the later movie, a variant of the bridge scene occurs with Gwen replaced by Mary Jane. Both Mary Jane and the Goblin are cast into a dimensional void in the forty-first episode of the series, because they couldn't get killed, due to the show's censorship.

Later in the [[Spider Wars|series finale]], Spider-Man visits a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], in which Peter Parker (Armored Spider-Man) is a wealthy industrialist similar to [[Iron Man]]. Gwen Stacy is his fiancée, and Spider-Man reflects that his alternate self is engaged to a woman he doesn't even know. [[Carnage (comics)|Spider-Carnage]] teams up with this dimension's [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in a plan to conquer or destroy every parallel reality (Spider-Carnage actually lied to Fisk that they were going to take over all reality).  

When Gwen tries to help Spider-Man stop Spider-Carnage, even after realizing that the Spider-Man we know isn't her fiancée, by using a sonic gun to kill him, Fisk foils the plan by removing the gun and Spider-Carnage kidnaps her, threatening to everyone present if one of them follows him, she'll die first before he destroys all reality, thus having Fisk realize about Spider-Carnage's real intentions.

Spider-Man then understands that Spider-Carnage isn't truly evil as he is confused because in his reality, his Uncle Ben and Aunt May have died and he is believed to be a clone to the Scarlet Spider, also known as Ben Reilly.  So, Spider-Man then goes to the Uncle Ben who was alive in this reality (Since this world's Spider-Man has never failed at anything, Uncle Ben was still alive) and tells him everything about Spider-Carnage's plan. Meanwhile, Spider-Carnage tells Gwen on how he'll destroy all reality - he's mixed up his dimension's Time Dilation Accelerator insides, thus creating an imbalance. So if a portal is created by the Accelerator, it will not lead to anywhere - it will vapourize anything that goes in there.  Spider-Man and Uncle Ben then arrive and Ben reforms Spider-Carnage while Spider-Man frees Gwen.  Spider-Carnage prevents the destruction of all reality but unfortunately cannot remove the Carnage symbiote. Gwen then witnesses as Spider-Carnage jumps into an unbalanced portal, killing himself. Gwen was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]].

====The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008)====
It has been confirmed that Gwen Stacy will be included in the upcoming [[Kids' WB!]] television series, ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. What role she will play is still uncertain, though from character art shown at Comic-Con 2007, the Gwen character is presented in a very bookworm fashion, in contrast to the design of Mary Jane Watson, possibly leaving the two as foils for the other's characters. She will be voiced by actress [[Lacey Chabert]]

===Novels===
Gwen Stacy appears in the sequel to the [[Mary Jane Watson#In Literature|Mary Jane novel]], where she is a nerdy, unpopular teenage girl who Mary Jane gives an extreme makeover, revealing Gwen Stacy's pretty face. However, Peter and Gwen start getting close, and MJ sees Gwen as a rival. In the end, Gwen and Mary Jane become best friends.

===Film===

In ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]), the Green Goblin holds Mary Jane above the Queensboro Bridge, not Gwen Stacy. Spider-Man is successful in saving Mary Jane when the Goblin throws her off, swinging down to catch her before she falls.

Gwen Stacy is portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. She is a new love interest for the titular character, serving as a rival to [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>http://forums.superiorpics.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/612931/Main/610896/</ref> Gwen is a classmate and lab partner of Peter, who (as Spider-Man) rescues her early in the film from a construction crane accident. She kisses an upside-down Spider-Man (the same way MJ kissed Spider-Man in the rain in the first film) which causes MJ to become angry and hurt. As Peter is at the top of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Connors]]' [[quantum mechanics]] class, he tutors her; Peter told MJ [[science]] wasn't Gwen's strongest subject. She considers Peter a [[genius]] and is very fond of him. 

She is also in a relationship with [[Venom (Eddie Brock)#Spider-Man 3|Eddie Brock]], who (as a friend) took pictures of her so Gwen could be a model. Eddie mistakes her casual friendship for the same kind of romantic attraction he feels for her. This relationship is short-lived, as Peter Parker, under the influence of the symbiote, steals her from Eddie (fueling his hatred for Parker) and goes out on a date with her. He dances with her at the same jazz club where MJ works, but Gwen realizes that Peter is doing this to make MJ jealous and as if Peter has moved on and does not care about her, she apologizes to Mary Jane, and leaves. 

She is later present at Harry Osborn's funeral, although it is never shown that they had met or have any relationship.
