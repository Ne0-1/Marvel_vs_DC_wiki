'''Gwendolyne "Gwen" Stacy''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She was a love interest to [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker). In most [[continuity|continuities]], she is second in Spider-Man's heart only to [[Mary Jane Watson]]. She has [[blonde hair]], in contrast to Mary Jane, who is a [[red hair|redhead]]; Gwen's [[eye color]], however, varies from continuity to continuity.

===Gwen Stacy in Earth 616===

====Life and death====

In the primary [[Earth 616]] continuity, Peter Parker met Gwen while they were undergraduates at [[Empire State University]]. Initially, Peter's problems as Spider-Man made him ignore her advances, and in return, she felt insulted by his aloofness. Gradually, however, a romance developed; Gwen, a science [[major]], seemed to appreciate Peter's intellectual personality, different from that of [[jock]]s like [[Flash Thompson]] and [[preppies]] like [[Harry Osborn]]. She was Peter Parker's first true love.

Their romance became more complicated when her father, Police Captain George Stacy, was killed by falling debris from a battle which involved Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus]]. Gwen blamed Spider-Man for that event, which set back their relationship for a while. Gwen left for Europe to deal with her loss. When she returned from Europe, Gwen and Peter resumed their relationship, but it would not last for long.

In the classic ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #121 (June [[1973]]), Gwen Stacy was held on a [[bridge]] by the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, who is aware that Peter Parker is Spider-Man). When the Green Goblin pushed her off, Spider-Man grabbed her legs with a string of web, but when he reached her she was dead. In anger, Spider-Man almost killed the Green Goblin in retaliation, but chose not to do so in the end.

It is not clear whether it was the shock of the fall or the sudden stop which killed her. This is a controversial issue; see [[#controversy|below]]. Her death became a pivotal event in Spider-Man's life; he considers it to be his greatest failure as Spider-Man. Her death is also an important milestone in comic book history; see [[#impact|below]].

====After death====

Miles Warren, a former professor of Gwen, had secretly been in love with her. Following her death, Warren grew increasingly insane, becoming the supervillain known as the [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]]; he also became completely obsessed with Gwen and created a [[cloning|clone]] of her. The Green Goblin manipulated the Jackal and the clone of Gwen and used both of them in the [[Clone Saga]]. Eventually the clone established her own identity.

In an extremely controversial story by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] in [[2004]], it was revealed that Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin's alter ego, fathered two children on Gwen Stacy, to whom she gave birth while she was in [[France]] shortly before her death. Feeling ashamed, she vowed that she would raise them with Peter.

Seeing her as a threat to his potential heirs, the Green Goblin killed Gwen Stacy. Norman Osborn then raised Gwen's two children, a boy and a girl Gwen had named Gabriel and Sarah, respectively. Due to Norman's enhanced blood, the twins aged faster than normal and became adults within the span of a few years. Osborn told them that Peter was really their father and was responsible for their mother's deaths.

The twins then attacked Spider-Man. Spider-Man told [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] about his initial encounter with Gabriel and Sarah, whereupon Mary Jane revealed that she knew about Norman's involvement with Gwen and told all to Peter. She had kept it from him all these years because Gwen was distraught and begged her not to say anything. By the story's end, Peter had told the twins the truth. Sarah believed Peter, but Gabriel did not. Gabriel took the Green Goblin formula and briefly became a new Green Goblin.

===Gwen Stacy in Ultimate Marvel===

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[continuity]], Gwen Stacy is a girl who is taken in by [[Aunt May]] after her father, Captain Stacy of the police, is killed by a robber who impersonated Spider-Man by wearing an identical costume. Living in the same house, Peter and Gwen are almost like siblings, though the relationship is complicated by Gwen's possible crush on Peter (who is dating [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]) and Gwen's hatred of Spider-Man (whom she blames for her father's death).

Recently, she learned that Peter is Spider-Man; fortunately, he managed to convince her that he was not to blame for her father's death, and she agreed to keep his secret. Soon after, however, in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #62, she was killed by [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], a vampiric monster made by the splicing of genetic material from Peter Parker and [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]. Although Peter was not in the area when she died, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation although it was used in a manner of which he had no knowledge, much less approval.

==The death of Gwen Stacy==

===Controversy===

There are two primary points of controversy surrounding the details of Gwen Stacy's death in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #121 (June [[1973]]).

====Bridge====

First, from which bridge did Gwen fall? Supposedly, it was the [[George Washington Bridge]]. However, the art depicts the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].

Further confusing the issue, as discussed [[#Gwen_Stacy_in_other_media|below]], [[Mary Jane Watson]] was held at the [[Queensborough Bridge]] in the [[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man movie]].

====Cause of death====

The bigger source of controversy is the cause of death, which is hotly debated among fans. There are two possibilities for how Gwen died: she could have died from the shock of the fall itself, or she could have died from the sudden stop.

If it was the shock of the fall, then there was nothing Spider-Man could have done once the Green Goblin pushed her off the bridge. She would have been dead before Spider-Man reached her.

However, Spider-Man himself worries that it was the sudden stop, and he torments himself with the what-if question that if he had not stopped her fall, she might have survived hitting the water below (though a realistic assessment indicates that hitting the water from that height would have probably killed her anyway).

The original comic featured a "snap" sound effect. Some fans believe this indicates that her neck was broken by being caught by Spider-Man's web. Other fans do not think this sound effect implies this. Further confusing the issue, some reprints of the story take out the "snap" sound effect.

===Impact===

The death of Gwen Stacy had enormous impact in the world of comic book fandom. Before her, except possibly as part of their origin story, superheroes simply did not fail so catastrophically. The girlfriend of the superhero did not die suddenly without warning and so violently. Because of this, the death of Gwen Stacy is often taken as a marker of the end of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] and the introduction of a new, darker era.

Gwen's death has been repeatedly revisited by many writers and artists:

* The fourth issue of the [[1994]] milestone mini-series ''[[Marvels]]'' centers on Gwen Stacy and her death.
* Gwen Stacy and, to a lesser extent, [[Mary Jane Watson]], are the focus of the critically-acclaimed ''Spider-Man: Blue'', a [[2002]] mini-series by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] that retells the beginning of Peter's relationship with the two women. 

Also in 2002, Marvel reprinted the issues leading up to and including Gwen Stacy's death as a graphic novel entitled ''The Death of Gwen Stacy''.

==Gwen Stacy in other media==

[[Image:gwentv.jpg|thumb|left|Gwen Stacy and Spider-Man meet in the Animated Series.]]
In the 1990s [[animated series]], as in the later movie, a variant of the bridge scene occurs with Gwen replaced by [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Both Mary Jane and the Goblin are cast into a dimensional void. Later in the series, Spider-Man visits a [[parallel universe]], in which Peter Parker is a wealthy industrialist. Gwen Stacy is his wife, and Spider-Man reflects that his alternate self is married to a woman whom he doesn't even know. 

In the film ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' ([[2002]]), the Green Goblin held not Gwen Stacy, who does not appear in the film, but rather [[Mary Jane Watson]] at a bridge. Spider-Man is successful in saving Mary Jane when the Green Goblin throws her off the bridge, which in the film is the [[Queensborough Bridge]].
