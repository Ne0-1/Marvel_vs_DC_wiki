'''Gwendolyne "Gwen" Stacy'''<ref name="name" /> was a [[supporting character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]’ [[Spider-Man]] series. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], she first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31 ([[1965#December|December 1965]]).

{{spoiler}}

A [[blonde]], bookish girl, Gwen was the first true love of the nerdy Peter Parker ([[Spider-Man]]). His [[supervillain|adversary]] the [[Green Goblin]] murdered Gwen in the [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121]] ([[1973#June|June 1973]]). Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel implemented it are controversial among fans, but it is still a pivotal point in both Spider-Man’s history and in [[American comic books]] in general. Spider-Man writers and fans disagree about who is the character’s “one true love,” Gwen or his subsequent wife [[Mary Jane Watson]].

==Character History==
===Peter Parker's girlfriend===
Gwen first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 (December [[1965]]); Peter Parker met Gwen while they were undergraduates at [[Empire State University]]. Initially, Peter's problems as Spider-Man made him ignore her advances, and in return, she felt insulted by his aloofness. Gradually, however, a romance developed; Gwen, a science major, seemed to appreciate Peter's intellectual personality, different from that of jocks like [[Flash Thompson]] and [[preppies]] like [[Harry Osborn]]. She was Peter Parker's first true love.

Their romance became more complicated when her father, Police Captain [[Spider-Man supporting characters#Gwen Stacy's relatives|George Stacy]], was killed by falling debris from a battle which involved Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus]] (''Amazing Spider-Man'' #90). Gwen blamed Spider-Man for that event, which set back their relationship for a while. Gwen left for Europe to deal with her loss. When she returned from Europe, Gwen and Peter resumed their relationship, but it would not last for long.

===The Death of Gwen Stacy===
{{main|The Night Gwen Stacy Died}}
[[Image:DeathOfGwenStacyCover.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Cover of graphic novel ''The Death of Gwen Stacy'']]
In the classic ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #121 (June [[1973]]), "[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]" by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and penciller [[Gil Kane]], Gwen Stacy was held on a [[bridge]] by the [[Green Goblin]] (Norman Osborn, who is aware that Peter Parker is Spider-Man). Spider-Man arrived to fight the Green Goblin, but Spider-Man was sick and not performing as well as usual. When the Green Goblin pushed Gwen Stacy off the bridge, Spider-Man caught her by a leg with a string of web. Spider-Man initially thought he had saved her, but when he pulled Gwen back up onto the bridge, he realized she was dead. In anger, Spider-Man almost killed the Green Goblin in retaliation, but chose not to do so in the end. The Green Goblin still seemingly died anyway when he was impaled by his own Goblin Glider in an attempt to kill Spider-Man (though the Green Goblin was later revealed to have survived).

The death of Gwen Stacy had enormous impact in the world of comic book fandom. Before her, except possibly as part of their origin story, superheroes simply did not fail so catastrophically. The girlfriend of the superhero did not die suddenly without warning, nor so violently. Because of this, the death of Gwen Stacy is often taken as a marker of the end of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] and the introduction of a new, darker era.

It is not clear whether it was the shock of the fall or the sudden stop which killed her. This is a controversial issue, because if it was the sudden stop, then in effect Spider-Man himself killed her. Physicist James Kalakios proves in his book ''The Physics of Superheroes'' that, consistent with [[Newton's Laws of Motion]], it was the sudden stop that killed Gwen Stacy.[http://www.it.umn.edu/news/inventing/2002_Spring/superhero.html] Her death became a pivotal event in Spider-Man's life; he considers it to be his greatest failure as Spider-Man.

===After death===

Gwen Stacy’s death had enormous repercussions. [[Mary Jane Watson]], a close friend of Gwen Stacy, was much affected by Gwen's death; her personality became much more serious. Gwen's death also drew Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually a romantic relationship. The Green Goblin's status in Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]] was much elevated by his murder of Gwen Stacy. Before the death of Gwen Stacy, Doctor Octopus had seemed to be Spider-Man's primary archnemesis, but the death of Gwen Stacy was key to making the Green Goblin, even more than Dr. Octopus, Spider-Man's primary archnemesis. Furthermore, the [[Punisher]], who has gone on to become an important character in the Marvel Universe since his [[first appearance]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #129 (February [[1974]]), was initially created as a character to hunt down Spider-Man.

[[The Punisher]] was manipulated into believing that Spider-Man had killed Gwen Stacy by a supervillain called the [[Jackal (Marvel comics)|Jackal]]. The Jackal was once Miles Warren, a former professor of Gwen, who had secretly been in love with her. Following her death, Warren grew increasingly insane and adopted the persona of the Jackal; he also became completely obsessed with Gwen and created a [[cloning|clone]] of her.

===Gwen Stacy’s clone===

Approximately two years (comic book time) after her death<ref>http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_giant_size/005.html</ref>, Gwen Stacy reappeared, perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time since her death. The Jackal, manipulated by Norman Osborn, had managed to create a clone of Gwen, and used her as part of a plot against Spider-Man in the [[Clone Saga#The original Clone Saga|original Clone Saga]]. At the end of that story, Gwen’s clone left to find a new life for herself.

In the 1988 crossover event, "[[The Evolutionary War]]," Gwen’s clone was captured by the [[High Evolutionary]], who had once been Miles Warren’s teacher. High Evolutionary was determined to discover how Warren had been able to perfect cloning. In the process he discovered that Warren had not, but had instead created a genetic virus (the so-called 'carrion virus') which transformed already living beings.

Later, Spider-Man investigated Warren's old laboratory and discovered that [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] had in fact been a genetic weapon created by Warren. Another former student of Warren's, Malcolm McBride, became infected with the virus and became the second Carrion.

The High Evolutionary told Spider-Man that she was, in fact, not a clone, but a normal woman named Joyce Delaney whom Warren had altered. One of his followers, Beautiful Dreamer, restored her memories. Later events, however, suggested that the High Evolutionary had lied (possibly in an attempt to discredit Warren) and Joyce Delaney never existed.

During the second [[Clone Saga]], Gwen’s clone, now married to a clone of Prof. Warren named Warren Miles, saw a copy of Peter Parker’s book of Spider-Man photos, ''Webs'', and remembered (to an extent) her real history and returned to New York City. During that storyline (in the last issues of the "Maximum Clonage" story arc), however, she disappeared from Spider-Man’s life again. She is thought to still be alive.

In many of her appearances, Gwen’s clone has appeared somewhat confused by her contradictory and bizarre memories.
====Other clones====
Another Gwen clone was created and introduced in Amazing Spider-Man (Vol. 1) #399. This Gwen clone believed that she was the real Gwen. She was killed off in the next issue of the story arc. (Spider-Man (Vol. 1) #56)  

In ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' (vol.3) #0 (December 1998) four Gwen clones appear. They were created by [[Arnim Zola]]. They currently live with the title character in San Francisco serving his wishes.

===Spider-Man: Blue===

[[Image:Deadgirl_gwen.jpg|thumb|right|Gwen, Dead Girl, and Mockingbird in the afterlife.  ''Dead Girl'' #1, art by [[Mike Allred]].]]
Gwen and, to a lesser extent, Mary Jane, are the focus of the critically-acclaimed ''Spider-Man: Blue'', a 2002 [[limited series]] by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] that retells the beginning of Peter's relationship with the two women.  

The [[frame narrative]] has Peter, several years after her death, on [[Valentine's Day]] recording a voice "letter" to his dead love.

===Dead Girl===
In the 2006 [[limited series]] ''[[X-Statix]] Presents: Dead Girl'', Gwen, along with [[Moira MacTaggert]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], are in [[Heaven]], where they are members of the Dead Sisters' [[Book club|Book Club]]. They assist [[Doctor Strange]], [[Dead Girl]], and a small group of dead heroes on a mission to the lower depths of [[Hell]].

===Sins Past===
<!--Please do not enhance the word "controversial". Example: do not edit the article to read "In the EXTREMELY controversial story" or anything to that effect. Aside from that, just try to maintain unbiased ([[NPOV]]). Happy editting!-->

In the controversial story arc "Sins Past" by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], taking place from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #509-514 (August [[2004]]-January [[2005]]), it was revealed that Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin's alter ego, fathered [[twin]]s, a boy and a girl, with Gwen Stacy, to whom she gave birth while she was in [[France]] shortly before her death. She vowed that she would raise them with Peter, and seeing his disregard for his sick son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], refused to allow Norman access to them.

Seeing her as a threat to his potential heirs, the Green Goblin killed Gwen Stacy. Norman Osborn then raised Gwen's two children, a boy and a girl Gwen had named Gabriel and Sarah, respectively. Due to Norman's enhanced blood, the twins aged about 2-3 times faster than normal and became adults within the span of a few years (they are speculated to be between 5 to 9 years old). Osborn told them that Peter was really their father and was responsible for their mother's death.
[[Image:AmazingSpiderMan511Cover.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Cover of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #511 depicting Sarah, Gwen Stacy's daughter. Art by Mike Deodato Jr.]]
The twins then attacked Spider-Man. Spider-Man told Mary Jane about his initial encounter with Gabriel and Sarah, whereupon Mary Jane revealed that she knew about Norman's involvement with Gwen and told all to Peter. She had kept it from him all these years because Gwen was distraught and begged her not to say anything. By the story's end, Peter had told the twins the truth. Sarah believed Peter, but Gabriel did not. Gabriel took the Green Goblin formula and briefly became the Grey Goblin. His glider exploded when it was shot by Sarah and he washed up on a beach with no memory of what happened.

====Controversy====
Straczynski later stated that he originally wanted Peter Parker to be the father of Gwen's kids but the editors [[veto]]ed the idea. They felt that it would age Peter Parker too much if he had two adult children. It was then decided by the whole creative and editorial team that Norman Osborn would be the father. [http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/rage/111497451826808.htm]

The story was controversial because it contradicted established continuity: none of the original issues upon which it was based (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #89 to 122) contain any hint of an attraction between Gwen and Norman (she never once referred to him by anything other than Mr. Osborn), nor any indication that she is pregnant or had ever been unfaithful to Peter. Her thought balloons were clear indicators that Gwen only had eyes for Peter Parker.
Her [[Spider-Man supporting characters#Gwen Stacy's relatives|aunt and uncle]] invite her to live with them in [[London]] in #93 after her father's death (which takes place in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #90), and the reason she stays away so long is given in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #98 as grief and anger over his death&mdash;not a pregnancy. She is clearly not pregnant when seen in #95. The trip itself lasts from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #93 to #98, the dialogue indicates that she was gone for no more than a few weeks&mdash;not several months, as suggested in "Sins Past." Mary Jane says in #512 that ''"Gwen had barely gotten back into town when we found out that Harry Osborn had overdosed on LSD,"'' but that happens over twenty issues after her return, in #120.

==Alternate continuities==
===Ultimate Gwen Stacy===
[[Image:Gwenstacyultimate.JPG|thumb|100px|Ultimate Gwen Stacy.  Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Gwen Stacy first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #14 (December [[2001]]). She is a teenage girl at Peter's high school who soon became close friends with Peter. In big contrast to her classic counterpart, Gwen was often loud and rebellious and often dressed in risque clothing. In this continuity, her eyes are [[amber]]-colored.<ref name="bagley-eyes">In an interview in [[Wizard Magazine]] #180 (2006), [[Mark Bagley]] remarked that there were some "coloring issues" in Gwen's first appearances, and that he did not intend her eyes to be yellow.</ref>

In her first appearance she gave a rousing speech on 'super powers' in today's societies; in the next issue she pulled a knife on [[Kenny McFarlane|Kong]], a classmate who was bullying Peter. She was suspended from school temporarily.

Gwen became friends with Peter after that (at one point stopping by his house for help after a possible suicide attempt), which led [[Mary-Jane Watson]] to believe that Gwen was vying for his affections.

Gwen was later taken in by [[Aunt May]] after her father, Police Captain John Stacy, was killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume. Her estranged mother did not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house created more tension between Peter and his girlfriend, and lead to their temporary break-up. Peter's relationship with Gwen was further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blamed for her father's death.

She eventually learned that Peter was Spider-Man and pulled her father's gun on him. Fortunately, he managed to convince her that he was not to blame for her father's death, and she agreed to keep his secret.

Gwen Stacy died in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #62. Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her that she never had romantic feelings for Peter, and that she considered him just as a friend (or, in her words, "her superhero little brother"). She was killed by [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage]], a vampiric monster made by the splicing of [[genetics|genetic]] material from Peter Parker, his father, and [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Dr. Curt Connors]]. Although Peter was not in the area when she died, he still felt some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation.

[[Image:Ultgwenkilled.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Gwen Stacy being killed by Carnage in issue #62]]

At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen's death. Flash made an off-color remark about Gwen's passing, and it led to a fight that ended up with him, Peter, MJ, Kong and Liz in detention. It was revealed that Flash had a crush on Gwen all along, and he felt bad that he never got the nerve to ask her out. [[Image:Gwen Stacy Return.JPG|thumb|150px|right|The return of Gwen Stacy?]]  Also, upon cleaning out Gwen's locker, Peter and MJ discover a photo of them smiling with Gwen hanging inside the locker, dating from a time the three skipped school earlier. 

Recently, a girl seeming to be Gwen Stacy appeared in ''Ultimate Spider-Man #98''. Says ''Ultimate artist'' [[Mark Bagley]], "Gwen’s return is integral to the Clone storyline and is basically a way to rock Peter's world...again."<ref>http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm</ref> The current Gwen has blue eyes, not amber. In this issue "Gwen" appeared to have no memory of her "death" and believed she was in a hospital, from which she had escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation overwhelms "Gwen" and she transforms into what appears to be [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]] before leaping out the window. (On a side note, it was revealed as far back as the thoughts page in issue #50 of Ultimate Spider-Man that Gwen would become Carnage.)

In the next issue, [[Richard Parker]], Peter's father, claims that "Gwen" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]].

Early in the series, ''Ultimate Spider-Man #25'' (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy's death in the [[Earth-616]] continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved.  The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the [[Queensboro Bridge]], and Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead. The cliffhanger was resolved in the next issue when Mary Jane awoke in #26, uninjured.

===What If: The Other===

At the very end of [[Peter David]]'s "What If: The Other" one-shot, [[Peter Parker]], now calling himself "Poison", uses part of the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] symbiote attached to him in a resurrection of Gwen Stacy. She takes the appearance of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].

===House of M===  
{{Main|Spider-Man: House of M}}

In the ''[[House of M]]'' storyline, in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] altered reality to give as many people as possible their greatest desires, Gwen was never killed. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist &ndash; and had a decidedly hostile relationship with [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] developer [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].

When the world was returned to normal at the conclusion of the story, Gwen remained dead and Mary Jane was again married to Peter - though Peter still had the memories of an idyllic life (and child) with Gwen. The shock of having his true life's memories restored was devastating to Peter.

Ironically, Mary Jane Watson, who was a very popular actress, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man's life story.
[[Image:SMLMJ Gwen Stacy.jpg|thumb|right|170 px|Gwen Stacy in [[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]].Art by [[Takeshi Miyazawa]].]]

===Age of Apocalypse===

In the two-issue mini-series [[X-Universe (comic)|X-Universe]] which detailed what happened to the rest of the Marvel Universe during the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Gwen Stacy was never killed by the Green Goblin but instead became the bodyguard of Donald Blake, who, in this reality, had never become [[the Mighty Thor]].

===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===

Gwen Stacy first appeared at the end of ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' # 5.

Gwen Stacy is the new girl at school and, as Peter Parker showed her around the school, she quickly became close friends with him. [[Mary-Jane Watson]] discovered her feelings for Peter and was about to tell him, when she discovered Gwen and Peter's blossoming relationship. She then decided to hide her feelings and didn't tell Peter. Gwen has provided a rival for his affections. In ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]'' #9, Peter and Gwen have taken their relationship to the next level by sharing a tender kiss, much to the dismay of Mary Jane.

===Spider-Man Unlimited Animated Comic===
In the fourth issue of the comic book based on the [[Spider-Man Unlimited]] animated series, Spidey encounters a [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of Gwen Stacy. She helps him escape a hidden paradise known as '''The Haven'''.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Gwen_animated.jpg|thumb|left|Gwen Stacy in her first animated appearance]]
Gwen was deliberately excluded from the [[1990s]] [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|animated series]], as the creators felt they could neither allow her to live nor deliberately include a character who was going to die. As in the later movie, a variant of the bridge scene occurs with Gwen replaced by Mary Jane. Both Mary Jane and the Goblin are cast into a dimensional void in the forty-first episode of the series, because they couldn't get killed, due to the show's censorship.

Later in the [[Spider Wars|series finale]], Spider-Man visits a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], in which Peter Parker (Armored Spider-Man) is a wealthy industrialist similar to [[Iron Man]]. Gwen Stacy is his fiancée, and Spider-Man reflects that his alternate self is engaged to a woman he doesn't even know. [[Carnage (comics)|Spider-Carnage]] teams up with this dimension's [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in a plan to conquer or destroy every parallel reality (Spider-Carnage actually lied to Fisk that they were going to take over all reality).  When Gwen tries to help Spider-Man stop Spider-Carnage, even after realizing that the Spider-Man we know isn't her fianceé, by using a sonic gun to kill him, Fisk foils the plan by removing the gun and Spider-Carnage kidnaps her, threatening to everyone present if one of them follows him, she'll die first before he destroys all reality, thus having Fisk realize about Spider-Carnage's real intentions.  Spider-Man then understands that Spider-Carnage isn't truly evil as he is confused because in his reality, his Uncle Ben and Aunt May have died and he is believed to be a clone to the Scarlet Spider, also known as Ben Reilly.  So, Spider-Man then goes to the Uncle Ben who was alive in this reality and tells him everything about Spider-Carnage's plan. Meanwhile, Spider-Carnage tells Gwen on how he'll destroy all reality - he's mixed up his dimension's Time Dilation Accelerator insides, thus creating an imbalance. So if a portal is created by the Accelerator, it will not lead to anywhere - it will vapourize anything that goes in there.  Spider-Man and Uncle Ben then arrive and Ben reforms Spider-Carnage while Spider-Man frees Gwen.  Spider-Carnage prevents the destruction of all reality but unfortunately cannot remove the Carnage symbiote. Gwen then witnesses as Spider-Carnage jumps into an unbalanced portal, killing himself by vapourizing himself and thus committing suicide. Gwen was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]].

===Novels===
Gwen Stacy appears in the sequel to the [[Mary Jane Watson#In Literature|Mary Jane novel]], where she is a nerdy and unpopular teenage girl who Mary Jane gives an extreme makeover, revealing Gwen Stacy's pretty face. However, Peter and Gwen start getting very close, and Gwen serves as a rival for MJ. In the end, Gwen and Mary Jane become friends.

In ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' ([[2002]]), the Green Goblin holds Mary Jane above the Queensboro Bridge, not Gwen Stacy. Spider-Man is successful in saving Mary Jane when the Goblin throws her off. The last name "Stacy" appears on a headstone in the cemetery during the funeral of Norman Osborn. 

In the official novilization of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' by [[Peter David]], Gwen Stacy makes a small cameo in one paragraph on page 106. While Peter is rambling during class about not making it on time for MJ's play, a girl described as a ''"pretty, young student, named Gwen Stacy"'' then precedes to whisper ''"Huh?"'' to Peter. He shrugs her off and continues to think about MJ. 

Gwen Stacy will be portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', set for release on May 4th, 2007. It has been revealed that she will be a new love interest for the title character, serving as a rival to Mary Jane Watson for his affections. <ref>http://forums.superiorpics.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/612931/Main/610896/</ref>
She will also be in a relationship with Eddie Brock, Junior.<ref name="ultimate">{{cite news | title=Ultimate Superhero Preview | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | pages=78, 80, 81, 230 | date =[[2006-09-29]] | accessdate=2006-09-29 }}</ref>
