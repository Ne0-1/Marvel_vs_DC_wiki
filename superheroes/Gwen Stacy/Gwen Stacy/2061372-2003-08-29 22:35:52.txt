'''Gwen Stacy''' was a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] who was the major sweetheart of [[Spider-Man]].

Peter Parker met her in college where his preoccupied life as Spider-Man made him seem aloof.  Eventually, Gwen warmed up to him and a romance developed.  That became more complicated when her father, Police Captain Stacy, was killed in a battle which involved Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus.  Gwen blamed Spider-Man for that event and so it hung over their relationship like a [[Sword of Damocles]]. But unlike the earlier situation with Betty Brant, Peter was ready to deal with it.

Eventually, Gwen Stacy was murdered by the [[Green Goblin]] at the George Washington Bridge despite Spider-Man's attempt to save her.   A clone of her was developed by an insane professor, but eventually that woman established her own identity.
