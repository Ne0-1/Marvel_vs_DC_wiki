'''Gwendolyn Maxine "Gwen" Stacy'''<ref name="name" /><ref name="middle_name" /> is a [[fictional]] character who appears in American [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as a [[supporting character]] in those featuring [[Spider-Man]]. A college student, Gwen was originally the first true love of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] before she was murdered by his nemesis [[the Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Spider-Man writers and fans alike often debate whether Peter's "one true love" is Gwen Stacy, or his subsequent love interest, [[Mary Jane Watson]], though stories written long after her death indicate that Gwen still holds a special place in his heart.

The character has been portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in the 2007 film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' and by [[Emma Stone]] as Peter Parker's friend and love interest in the 2012 [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and the sequel ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], she first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31 (December 1965). The [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] kidnapped and threw Gwen Stacy off the [[George Washington Bridge]] in [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man''#121]] (June 1973) after his Goblin persona returned as a result of stress in his life. Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel implemented it remain controversial among fans because some believe that Peter himself was the one that caused her death.  The death became a pivotal point in both Spider-Man’s history and in [[American comic book]]s in general. Many point to Gwen's death as the end of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of Comics]].<ref name="Blumberg">{{cite journal| last = Blumberg | first = Arnold T. |date=Fall 2003| title = 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died:' The End of Innocence and the Birth of the Bronze Age| journal = Reconstruction| volume = 3| issue = 4| url =http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-14}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Background===
Gwen Stacy first appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 (December 1965).<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 31|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= This monumental issue saw the first appearances of Peter's upcoming love interest Gwen Stacy, prospective best friend, Harry Osborn, and even the future super villain known as the Jackal.}}</ref> Peter Parker meets Gwen while both are studying as undergraduates at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30–33  | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Initially, with [[Aunt May]] in the hospital, Peter feels troubled and ignores her advances. Furious, she dates both [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Harry Osborn]]. Gradually, however, a romance develops; Gwen, a science major, seems to appreciate Peter's intellectual personality. In the comic books, their relationship begins almost immediately after Peter stops going out with Mary Jane, who he starts seeing as shallow and self-absorbed.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Their relationship almost ends before it begins. A mind-controlled (police) Captain [[George Stacy]], Gwen's father, gets into a fight with Peter, which Gwen observes. Thinking Peter attacked her father, she halts the relationship. Gwen eventually learns the truth. She and Peter reconcile. Their romance becomes more complicated when Gwen's father is killed by falling debris during a battle involving Spider-Man and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #90</ref><ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 55: "Captain George Stacy had always believed in Spider-Man and had given him the benefit of the doubt whenever possible. So in Spider-Man's world, there was a good chance that he would be destined to die."</ref> Gwen blames Spider-Man for his death, which sets their relationship back for a while. Gwen leaves for Europe to cope with her loss. She wants Peter to ask her to marry him and convince her to stay, but his guilt stops him from proposing.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Peter goes to London to see Gwen, but is forced into action as Spider-Man and leaves without seeing Gwen, reasoning that it would be too easy for her to put the pieces together if Peter Parker and Spider-Man are both sighted in London.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #96</ref> Gwen eventually realizes her error in trying to pressure Peter into marriage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #98</ref> She returns to New York and they get back together.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #99</ref>

===Death===
{{Main|The Night Gwen Stacy Died}}
In [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #121]] (June 1973), by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and penciller [[Gil Kane]], inked by [[John Romita Sr]] and [[Tony Mortellaro]], the [[Green Goblin]] ([[Norman Osborn]], who has identified Peter Parker as Spider-Man) holds Gwen Stacy captive on a tower of the [[George Washington Bridge]]. [[Spider-Man]] arrives to fight the Green Goblin. When the Goblin throws Gwen Stacy off the bridge, Spider-Man catches her by her leg with a string of web. He initially thinks he has saved her. After he pulls her back onto the bridge, he realizes she has already died. Devastatingly, the whiplash from Spider-Man's webbing is what actually killed her. In shock and anger, Spider-Man nearly kills the Green Goblin in retaliation, but in the end chooses not to do so. But despite his restraint, the Green Goblin seemingly dies anyway when he is impaled by his own [[goblin glider]] while attempting to kill Spider-Man. Norman Osborn would not return for nearly three hundred issues. Peter is left wondering if Gwen was dead before the fall or if his attempt to save her by breaking her fall snapped her neck.

The death of Gwen Stacy had an enormous impact in the world of comic-book fandom.<ref>[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm The Night Gwen Stacy Died: The End of Innocence and the Birth of the Bronze Age]</ref> Before her, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes did not fail so catastrophically; nor did a loved one of the superhero die so suddenly without warning.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 159|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In June [1973], Marvel embarked on a story that would have far-reaching effects.

In the real world, physicist [[James Kakalios]] shows in his book ''[[The Physics of Superheroes]]'' that, consistent with [[Newton's laws of motion]], the sudden stop would have killed Gwen Stacy.<ref>[http://www.it.umn.edu/news/inventing/2002_Spring/superhero.html ''Inventing Tomorrow'' (University of Minnesota Institute of Technology magazine), Spring 2002: "Jim Kakalios enlists the aid of costumed crimefighters to teach critical thinking in an imaginative freshman seminar" by  Paul Sorenson]</ref> The comic book ''Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man'' (2007) concurred that the proximate<!--word is correct; NOT "approximate"--> cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-speed fall.  An issue of ''Peter Parker/Spider-Man'' revisits the issue, and further confirms Gwen died of a broken neck due to the use of the webbing.{{issue|date=August 2012}} Contradictorily, in the fourth issue of ''[[Marvels]],'' the police forensic scientist reports that she died from the shock of the fall prior to her neck breaking, placing the blame on the Green Goblin and not Spider-Man.

During a later encounter, the Green Goblin throws Mary Jane off of the Brooklyn Bridge. Peter, having learned from Gwen's death, is able to save her using multiple net-webs that attach across her body (he is inadvertently assisted by how the Goblin throws her, as her body is mostly horizontal instead of vertical like Gwen's), thus stopping her entire body at the same time and preventing her neck from breaking.

===After death===
Within the fictional universe, Gwen Stacy's death has enormous repercussions. [[Mary Jane Watson]] feels the loss of Gwen deeply and becomes a more mature, compassionate person. Gwen's death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually to romance.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Miles Warren, one of Gwen's professors, was secretly in love with her. Following her death, Warren grows increasingly insane and adopts the persona of the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-man'' #129</ref> In the fourth and final issue of the miniseries ''[[Marvels]]'' (April 1994), photographer Phil Sheldon befriends Gwen Stacy, who has absolved Spider-Man of any blame for her father's death. Gwen's simple faith in heroes convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the "Marvels" (i.e., superheroes)—to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to praise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. When the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage to bait Spider-Man, Sheldon frantically follows the resulting chase in a taxi. He arrives at the [[George Washington Bridge]] in time to see Spider-Man fight the Goblin and to see Gwen accidentally knocked off the bridge and killed, despite Spider-Man's desperate attempt to save her. Sheldon's faith in the Marvels is shattered. He retires from news photography, but not before passing on the body of his work to his assistant Marcie.<ref>''Marvels #4''</ref>

===Clones===
Approximately two years after her death,<ref>[http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_giant_size/005.html SpiderFan.org - Comics : Giant-Size Spider-Man #5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Gwen Stacy reappears in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 (May 1975), perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time since her death. The Jackal has managed to create a clone of Gwen and has babies with her, and uses her as part of a plot against Spider-Man in the [[Clone Saga#The original Clone Saga|original Clone Saga]]. At the end of that story, Gwen's clone leaves to find a new life for herself.{{issue|date=December 2012}}
[[Image:Spider-Man Blue Vol 1 5.jpg|thumb|left|Gwen Stacy and [[Mary Jane Watson]] on the cover of ''[[Spider-Man: Blue]]'' Vol. 1 #3.]]

In the 1988 crossover "[[The Evolutionary War]]", the [[High Evolutionary]], who had once been Miles Warren's teacher, captures Gwen's clone. He is dismayed to learn that Miles Warren has perfected the art of cloning and thus lies to the new men that it was nothing more than a genetic construct created by a virus that he injected his apprentice, Joyce Delaney.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

During the second "[[Clone Saga]]", Gwen Stacy's clone, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker's book of Spider-Man photos, ''Webs'', and remembers (to an extent) her real history. She returns to New York City. During this storyline, she again disappears from Spider-Man's [[personal life|life]]. It was recently revealed the Gwen Stacy clone introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 was in fact the second Gwen clone Miles Warren created and has been living in London under the name Joyce Delaney. This clone was murdered by the Gwen Stacy clone known as Abby-L.<ref>''Spider-Island Deadly Foes'' #1</ref>

Another Gwen clone appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (March 1995).  This clone believes she is the real Gwen.{{issue|date=December 2012}} She dies from clone degeneration in ''Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #56 (March 1995), the next issue of the story arc.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

A further Gwen clone appears in the "Sibling Rivalry" crossover storyline between ''[[Superior Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' and ''[[Scarlet Spider]]''. She joins the Jackal (alongside [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] and a regular Miles Warren clone) in capturing [[Superior Spider-Man]] and [[Kaine]].<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #2</ref> She is sympathetic towards "Peter" and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal to the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal's lab is engulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is seemingly consumed by the fire.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' (Vol. 2) #20</ref>

==="Sins Past" and "Sins Remembered"===
<!--Please do not enhance the word "controversial." Example: do not edit the article to read "In the EXTREMELY controversial story" or anything to that effect. Aside from that, just try to maintain unbiased ([[NPOV]]). Happy editing!-->

The story arc Sins Past" by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #509–514 (August 2004–January 2005) reveals [[Norman Osborn]], the Green Goblin's ''alter ego'', fathered twins, a boy and a girl, with Gwen Stacy, to whom she gave birth while in [[France]] shortly before her death. She vowed she would raise them with Peter (despite the fact that he was not aware of Gwen's infidelity) and refused to allow Norman access to them. Seeing her as a threat to his potential heirs, the Green Goblin killed Gwen. Norman Osborn then raised Gwen's two children, a boy and a girl named Gabriel and Sarah. Due to Norman's enhanced blood, the twins aged about 2 to 3 times faster than normal and became adults within the span of a few years. Osborn told them Peter was really their father and was responsible for their mother's death.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The twins then attack Spider-Man, and he subsequently deduces their true identities. However, in seeking to confirm it, Peter goes to Gwen's grave and digs up a sample of her DNA to compare to the twins' DNA. Spider-Man tells Mary Jane about his initial encounter with [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah]], whereupon Mary Jane reveals she knew about Norman's involvement with Gwen. By the story's end, Peter has told the twins the truth. Sarah believes Peter and concludes he would never have dug up Gwen's grave to acquire a DNA sample if he thought there was even a chance ''he'' was their father—but Gabriel does not. Gabriel takes the Green Goblin formula and briefly becomes the Grey Goblin. His glider explodes when it is shot by Sarah. He washes up on a beach with no memory of what happened.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

"Sins Remembered", a follow-up story to "Sins Past" (published in ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' (Vol. 2) issues #23–26, December 2004&nbsp;– March 2005 and written by Samm Barnes with art by Scot Eaton) spins directly out of the events of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #509–514. Spider-Man locates Sarah in [[Paris]], where Sarah has her brother (suffering from [[amnesia]]) restrained in her home. With the help of Spider-Man and [[Interpol]], Sarah helps build a case against a criminal called [[Dupres]] in exchange for the government's help with her rapid-aging disease. However, during this time Gabriel escapes and has yet to be seen again. This [[story arc]] was later collected as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] in 2005 as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Vol. 5: Sins Remembered'' (ISBN 0-7851-1628-1).

Straczynski later stated he originally wanted to make Peter Parker the father of Gwen's kids but the editors vetoed the idea. They felt it would age Peter Parker too much if he had two adult children. The whole creative and editorial team then decided Norman Osborn would be the father.<ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/rage/111497451826808.htm SBC.com (no date): All the Rage (column){{spaced ndash}}"Don't Panic", by Blair Marnell & John Voulieris]</ref> In an e-mail to the comic book website [[Newsarama]], Straczynski claimed he regretted the version of "Sins Past" that went to press, and he had hoped to "[[retcon]]" it out of continuity during the events of the then-recent "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]" storyline: "I wanted to retcon the Gwen twins out of continuity, which was something I always assumed I could do at the end of my run. I wasn't allowed to do this, and yes, it pissed me off."<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=141756 J. Michael Straczynski rebuttal to OMD]</ref> In the original plans for "One More Day", the story would have ended with Gwen Stacy being resurrected by Mephisto's reality-warping spell along with Harry Osborn, but it was eventually decided to let her remain dead. Her son, Gabriel, has reappeared in subsequent stories. He exhibits a split personality where he commits crimes and then his heroic "American Son" persona tries to undo them. He is captured by Harry and Spider-Man.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Sarah's present activities are unknown.

==Other versions==

==="Age of Apocalypse"===
In the two-issue mini-series ''X-Universe'', which details what happened to the rest of the Marvel Universe during the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, the Green Goblin never killed Gwen Stacy. Instead she became the bodyguard of Donald Blake, who, in this reality, had never become [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|the Mighty Thor]]. Sometime later in the mainstream universe in X-Man #37, the Age of Apocalypse version of Gwen is pulled from her reality to the mainstream Earth's George Washington Bridge, much to Spider-Man's shock.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===Gwenpool===
Due to the popularity of [[Spider-Gwen]], in June 2015 Marvel published variant covers for 20 of the current series, which saw Gwen Stacy reimagined as other Marvel characters, such as [[Doctor Strange]], [[Groot]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/24438/gwen_takes_over |title=GWEN TAKES OVER|publisher=Marvel |date=14 April 2015}}</ref> One of those variants for "Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars #2" featured an amalgam of Gwen Stacy and [[Deadpool]] dubbed "Gwenpool", which turned out to be especially popular with the fans.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rich |last= Johnston |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/08/21/and-finally-has-marvel-noticed-that-gwenpool-is-a-thing-now/|title=And Finally… Has Marvel Noticed That Gwenpool Is A Thing Now?R|publisher=Bleeding Cool |date= August 21, 2015}}</ref> As the result, Marvel has announced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, first as a three-page backup story starting in "[[Howard the Duck]] #1", and second as a one-shot "Gwenpool Special #1".<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-announces-gwenpool-one-shot-howard-the-duck-back-up-stories|title=MARVEL ANNOUNCES "GWENPOOL HOLIDAY SPECIAL," "HOWARD THE DUCK" BACKUP STORIES|publisher=Comicbookresources |date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> In the Howard the Duck #2 backup it was reveled her name is Gwen Poole not Gwen Stacy.

==="House of M"===
In the reality seen in the "[[House of M]]" storyline, in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans, Gwen was never killed. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist – and had a decidedly hostile relationship with [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] developer [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man's life story. Gwen and her father read textual accounts of their deaths in the main universe, though they believe this simply to be the morbid imaginings of Peter Parker, who is suffering from mental health issues.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #1-3 (2005)</ref>

However, the Torinos continued to harass Gwen at Midtown, prompting Spider-Man to help the police take down the gang.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #55.

Marvel Comics</ref> Later, Gwen was brainwashed by [[Emma Frost]] into believing ''she'' was dating Peter. Gwen's brainwashing wore off (or was undone by Emma), but Gwen now believes her relationship with Peter ended when he chose Chat over her,<ref>''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> causing her to treat Chat very coldly. She has since warmed to Chat, however.<ref>''Spider-Man Marvel Adventures'' #6.

He did not intend her eyes to be yellow.</ref> In her first appearance she gives a rousing speech on 'super powers'; in the next issue she pulls a knife on [[Kenny McFarlane|Kong]], a classmate who was bullying Peter. She is suspended from school temporarily. Gwen becomes friends with Peter, which leads [[Mary Jane Watson#Ultimate|Mary Jane Watson]] to believe Gwen is vying for his affections.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gwen is later taken in by [[Aunt May#Ultimate Aunt May|Aunt May]] after her father, police captain John Stacy, is killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume. Her estranged mother does not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house creates more tension between Peter and Mary Jane, and leads to their temporary break-up. Peter's relationship with Gwen is further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blames for her father's death. When Peter finds his friend [[Eddie Brock]], Gwen confides in him about her feelings of isolation. Eddie then tries to kiss her. Gwen is shocked.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

When she eventually learns Peter is Spider-Man, the angry Gwen pulls her father's gun on him. Fortunately, he manages to convince her he is not to blame for her father's death. Gwen runs off but returns, explaining she is just really mad at everything at the moment. She wouldn't have really shot him, a fact Peter already knew because his spider sense didn't go off despite Gwen's wrath. Gwen then agrees to keep his secret.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

Gwen Stacy dies in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #62.  Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her she never had romantic feelings for Peter. She considered him just as a friend. She is killed by [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage]], a vampiric monster made by the splicing of [[genetics|genetic]] material from Peter Parker, his father, and [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Dr. Curt Connors]]. Although Peter is not in the area when she dies, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation. His guilt makes him decide to retire as Spider-Man for a while. Eventually, he takes up his hero identity when his responsibility for the innocent becomes too great to overlook.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen's death. [[Flash Thompson#Ultimate Spider-Man|Flash]] makes an off-color remark about Gwen's passing. It infuriates MJ to the point where she physically attacks Flash. It is revealed Flash had a crush on Gwen all along.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

A girl seeming to be Gwen Stacy appears in ''Ultimate Spider-Man #98''. Says ''Ultimate artist'' [[Mark Bagley]], "Gwen’s return is integral to the Clone storyline and is basically a way to rock Peter's world...again."{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm ""]. Wizard Universe.  {{wayback|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001060044.cfm |date=20080122065848 }}</ref> In this issue "Gwen" appears to have no memory of her "death" and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages "Gwen". She transforms into what appears to be [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Ultimate Carnage]] before leaping out the window.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

In the next issue, "[[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]" claims "Gwen" should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in [[stem cell research]]. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayer drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue #113, Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin causes a massive prison break from the Triskelion. An inmate appearing to be 'Gwen' walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It has been revealed the creature posing as Gwen Stacy is still the original Ultimate Carnage Spider-Man faced earlier in its run. After "devouring" Gwen, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her "essence" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy.{{dead link|date=August 2013}}<ref>[http://www.ign.com/comics/ultimate-spider-man "Ultimate Spider-Man Pictures Full Size"]. [[IGN]].</ref>

During the "War of the Symbiotes" storyline, Gwen/Carnage's back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with Tony Stark. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker's house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage's face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Venom on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After SHIELD intervenes, SHIELD Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen's life. Six months after the "Ultimatum" storyline, in ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #1, Gwen is living with the Parkers again and seems to be dating Peter. However, circumstances involving the Chameleon made Gwen realize she made a mistake dating Peter. She breaks up with him, but still lives with the Parkers due to Gwen and Aunt May has become close in a surrogate mother-daughter fashion.  After Peter's death, Gwen and May re-located in [[France]], but returned to New York after hearing about the re-emergence of a [[Miles Morales|new Spider-Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #11</ref><ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #13</ref>  Afterwards, they meet the Peter Parker of the [[Earth-616]] continuity after he was accidentally and briefly sent to the Ultimate universe,<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3</ref> with Gwen being intrigued to learn about her counterpart (although she is not informed that her other self dead, Gwen also "neglecting" to tell Peter that she is a clone), as she also attempts to tell Mary Jane about the other Peter's arrival in their world.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #4</ref>

When Green Goblin escapes custody after S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down, he arrives at the front yard of Aunt May's house and confronts the new Spider-Man.<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #3</ref> Gwen and Aunt May are inside watching the television where the battle of the new Spider-Man and Green Goblin was being broadcast. Soon, Spider-Man emerges to aid the new Spider-Man in the fight, to the surprise of Gwen and Aunt May. Green Goblin flees at his arrival and the two Spider-Men depart. Gwen is unsure of the identity of the original Spider-Man, however, Aunt May assures her that his motives show that it him.<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4</ref> Later, Gwen and Aunt May walk over to Mary Jane's house and overhear  Peter's unknown resurrection.

Early in the series, ''Ultimate Spider-Man #25'' (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy's death in the [[Earth-616]] continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved. The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead. The cliffhanger was resolved in the next issue when Mary Jane awoke in #26, uninjured.{{issue|date=July 2013}}

===''What If''===
In "What if Gwen Stacy had lived?", Peter manages to save Gwen by jumping after her rather than catching her with a web-line. In doing this, he was able to cushion her from the impact as they hit the water and subsequently give her CPR. In the aftermath of this rescue, Gwen sees him without his mask. After explaining himself to her, Peter proposes to Gwen. She accepts. Meanwhile, the Green Goblin - believing Spider-Man to be dead - calls a meeting of assorted underworld figures at a deserted warehouse. Then Spider-Man shows up for another confrontation...which turns the mobsters against the Goblin, when they mistakenly presume this to be a setup. The Goblin is pursued to his apartment, where Norman Osborn at last fights off his evil side for good - upon seeing his son Harry move to protect him from Spider-Man. Harry's loyalty makes Norman realizes that he cannot kill his own son, which permanently saves him from himself. Unfortunately, Norman has already mails to "Spider-Man's second greatest enemy" ([[J. Jonah Jameson]]) proof of Spider-Man's real identity (following the Goblin's escape from the warehouse). On the day of Peter's wedding to Gwen, Jonah has published the expose and uses it to acquire a warrant for Peter's arrest, thus forcing Peter to escape from the police mere moments after his wedding to Gwen. The shock of her nephew "being that awful Spider-Man" causes Aunt May to have a heart attack as well. As the issue ends, Gwen departs with [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe 'Robbie' Robertson]], who promises Gwen they will do whatever they can to help Peter and quits the ''Bugle''.<ref>''What If?'' Volume 1 #24</ref>

In "What If Spider-Man Had Kept His Six Arms?", Spider-Man (whose six-arms mutation was permanent here) was able to prevent Gwen Stacy's death.<ref>''What If?'' Volume 2 #42</ref>

At the very end of [[Peter David]]'s one-shot titled "What If: The Other," [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] (now calling himself "Poison") uses part of the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] symbiote attached to him in the resurrection of Gwen Stacy. She takes the appearance of [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].<ref>''What If: The Other''</ref>

===Television===
* Gwen Stacy was deliberately excluded from the 1990s [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|animated series]], as the creators felt they could neither allow her to live nor deliberately include a character who was going to die.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} As a result, a variant of the bridge scene occurs with Gwen replaced by Mary Jane Watson with both Mary Jane and Green Goblin are cast into a dimensional void. Also, aspects of the character were blended with [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]]. An alternate version of Gwen did appear in the episode "Farewell Spider-Man" voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]]. She appears as the fiancée of the high-tech armored Spider-Man (that resembles [[Iron Man]]), thus never in a relationship with Peter Parker in this parallel universe. The primary version of Spider-Man meets Gwen for the first time. Gwen plays a role in help defeating [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Carnage]].
* Gwen Stacy appeared in almost every episode of ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]. In the series, Gwendolyn Stacy is friends with Peter Parker and Harry Osborn. She is the daughter of New York Police Department captain George Stacy. She had romantic feelings for Peter but when he dated Liz Allen she dated Harry, although the series was canceled before Peter and Gwen got into a relationship.

: Harry later seeks to cause Peter pain, by playing on Gwen's concern for him after Norman's apparent death; Gwen is forced to stay his girlfriend, since she would be the only one to care for him.

===Film===
====Sam Raimi series====
* Gwen Stacy is portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. She is a potential new [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], serving as an unintended rival to [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Gwen is a classmate and lab partner of Peter Parker and Spider-Man rescues her early in the film from a construction crane accident. She kisses an upside-down Spider-Man in similar fashion to how Mary Jane did in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' which causes MJ to become angry and hurt. As Peter is at the top of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Connors]]'s [[quantum mechanics]] class, he tutors her. She considers Peter a [[genius]] and is very fond of him. She is also friends with [[Eddie Brock]] as he took pictures of her so Gwen could be a model. His relationship is short-lived, as Peter, under the influence of the symbiote, steals her from Eddie. He dances with her at the same jazz club where MJ works, but Gwen realizes Peter is doing this to make MJ jealous, Gwen was upset about this and walks up to Mary Jane and sadly said "I'm so sorry", and storms out of the club, leaving Peter behind. She is later present at [[Harry Osborn]]'s funeral.
* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] said she would love to be a part of any continuation of the film franchise, while acknowledging her character's opportunity may have passed, especially after ''Spider-Man 3'' ended with Peter and Mary-Jane once again in each other’s arms. In May 2007, actor [[James Cromwell]], who played Captain Stacy in the film stated he thought the natural progression for the character would be for both to die early in ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'' mirroring the comics. Howard said a death would not have bothered her. The film was ultimately unmade despite Stacy making the draft.

====Marc Webb series====
* [[Emma Stone]] portrays Gwen Stacy in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as Peter Parker's love interest. She works as an assistant at [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]'s laboratory at [[Oscorp]], where Peter gets bitten by the spider. She subsequently develops a crush on him, and he soon reveals to her his secret identity as Spider-Man. Gwen plays an important role in the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]'s defeat, by helping Peter develop an antidote for the serum that mutates people into reptilian hybrids through cross-species genetics, using her own scientific background. Unfortunately, her father is killed by the Lizard before Peter can defeat the villain. George begs Peter to keep Gwen out of his dangerous life. Peter honors that vow without telling Gwen immediately; this affronts Gwen until she realizes what her father did, and subsequently forgives Peter. However, when Peter later wonders if he should keep said promise, she just smiles at this development.
* Emma Stone reprises her role as Gwen Stacy in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. Gwen continues to work at Oscorp, under control of [[Harry Osborn]], Peter's best friend, but because Peter keeps breaking his promise to Gwen's father to stay away from her he continually breaks up and makes up with her so to settle they try being just friends. Their relationship is further strained when Gwen tells Peter that she is moving to Oxford University in England. Gwen witnesses Peter, as Spider-Man, his first fight with Max Dillon aka Electro who is also an employee of Oscorp and when she begins looking into Max's incident she is shut out and forced to run from the company. Later when Gwen is in a taxi for the airport Spider-Man leaves a message in web on the bridge saying "I love you" and he then swoops her up onto the bridge and tells her that he is going wherever she goes. However, their reunion is cut short when Electro starts shorting out the power to the city and Spider-Man and Gwen work together to stop Electro first by making Peter's web shooters electric-proof with a car battery and then by reversing the electrical charge so Spider-Man can fire it at Max and destroys him. Coming out of the control tower, Harry arrives with mutated skin, a glider and a battle suit. Learning Spider-Man is Peter thanks to Gwen, Harry takes Gwen hostage atop of the power plant's clock tower. Dropping her through the glass rooftop, Spider-Man saves her and begins battle against Harry. Gwen watched as the two fight and then begins to fall again thanks to Harry being knocked off of his glider. Gwen dangles as the two wrestle on the gears above and the web line eventually breaks. Spider-Man catches her with another web an instant too late as her head hits the concrete floor, killing her instantly. Gwen's death sends Peter into depression for five months, but finally after a talk with Aunt May and being inspired by watching Gwen's graduation speech about hope and life, he is able to resume being Spider-Man to honor her memory and beliefs.
