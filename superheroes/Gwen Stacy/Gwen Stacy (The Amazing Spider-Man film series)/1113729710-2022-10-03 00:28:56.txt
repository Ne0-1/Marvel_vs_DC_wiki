'''Gwendolyne Maxine Stacy''' is a fictional character in [[Marc Webb]]'s ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film series)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' films, based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Gwen Stacy|character of the same name]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. She was portrayed by [[Emma Stone]] in the films ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. As opposed to taking a supporting role in the [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|previous film trilogy]], Gwen is given a prominent role in Webb's films as one of [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter Parker]]'s classmates, serving as his primary love interest and a [[foil (fiction)|foil]] to his character. Webb based Gwen's character off of her traditional comic-book portrayal. For her performance in the films, Stone has received critical praise and wider recognition, despite the divided response to the film series as a whole.

==Character development and execution==
===Origins and casting===
The character of Gwen Stacy first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 in 1965. Intended to be [[Spider-Man]]'s primary love interest, she was soon superseded in popularity by [[Mary Jane Watson]] in that role by fans. This eventually led to the now-controversial decision by Spider-Man writers to [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|kill off Gwen]], which served as one of the most pivotal moments in comic-book history; Spider-Man's failure to save Gwen was one of the first big failures by a superhero, and is regarded as the end of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref name="Blumberg">{{cite journal| last = Blumberg| first = Arnold T.| date = Fall 2003| title = 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died:' The End of Innocence and the Birth of the Bronze Age| journal = Reconstruction| volume = 3| issue = 4| url = http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| access-date = 2008-11-14| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100116034408/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/034/blumberg.htm| archive-date = 2010-01-16}}</ref> The character has subsequently been cloned or revived several times or seen different iterations in the comics, including one as [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]], and has been included in several television shows and cartoons based on Spider-Man.

The first big-budget cinematic appearance of Gwen Stacy was in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', with [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] portraying the character in a supporting role, as Mary Jane was already serving as Peter's main love interest in that trilogy. Following the cancellation of ''Spider-Man 4'' and reboot of the Spider-Man film series, it was originally reported that both Gwen and Mary Jane would appear in the first film  of the new series before Gwen was confirmed as the only one of Peter's love interests to appear.<ref name="Sperling">{{cite magazine|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2010/09/23/spider-man-female-leads-theyre-getting-closer/|title='Spider-Man' female leads: they're getting closer|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| last=Sperling| first=Nicole|date=September 23, 2010|access-date=September 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|url=https://www.thewrap.com/deal-central/column-post/martin-sheen-play-uncle-ben-sonys-spider-man-reboot-22295|title=Martin Sheen & Sally Field in Talks to Raise 'Spider-Man'|publisher=TheWrap.com|date=November 4, 2010|access-date=November 6, 2010}}</ref> The shortlist of actresses to play the role included [[Lily Collins]], [[Ophelia Lovibond]], and [[Imogen Poots]], with [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Emma Roberts]], and [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], as reported by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' as "potentially in the mix".<ref>{{cite news|last=Rome|first=Emily|url=http://heatvision.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/08/spiderman-marc-webb-imogen-poots-lilly-collins-ophelia-lovibond-teresa-palmer-emma-roberts.html| title=Will one of these women be Spider-Man's love interest?

==Film appearances==
===''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (2012)===
{{main|The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)}}
Gwen first appears as the daughter of [[NYPD]] captain [[George Stacy]] and as a classmate to [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter Parker]] and [[Flash Thompson]] at [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown Science High School]]. She breaks up a fight between the two, admonishing Flash for not finishing his homework and for beating up Peter, then later commends the latter for standing up to Flash. Peter and Gwen begin to develop a mutual interest in each other from that point onwards. They encounter each other later at [[Oscorp]], where Gwen is interning as a research assistant, as Peter sneaks into the facility to find [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] and is later bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him new abilities. Gwen catches up with Peter after his [[Uncle Ben]] picks him up following after-school detention, and later consoles Peter after Ben's death.

After Peter starts tracking down Ben's killer as a masked vigilante, Gwen invites him to dinner with her family, where Peter and Captain Stacy argue about the vigilante's motives. Afterwards, Peter reveals to her that he is, in fact, the vigilante, sharing a kiss with her. Gwen also plays a crucial part in the Lizard's defeat; having helped Peter develop an antidote for Connors' serum for turning people into reptilian hybrids using her own scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, her father is killed by the Lizard before Peter can defeat the villain. George makes Peter promise to keep Gwen out of his dangerous life. Peter honors that vow without immediately telling Gwen, which offends her until she realizes what her father did and forgives Peter. However, when Peter later hints that he's reconsidering keeping that vow, she quietly smiles at this development.

===''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' (2014)===
{{main|The Amazing Spider-Man 2}}
Two years later, Gwen and Peter are graduating from high school. She calls him, telling him that he'll be "late" to the graduation ceremony while unbeknownst to her, he is in action as Spider-Man helping the NYPD apprehend [[Rhino (character)|Aleksei Sytsevich]]. Peter arrives just after Gwen finishes her speech as [[valedictorian]] to collect his diploma, kissing her in front of the crowd. Gwen and Peter talk where she invites him to dinner before she was called by her mother for a family photo. Later in the evening, Peter tells Gwen about the visions of her father he's been having and insists that he needs to keep his promise which as a result, Gwen breaks up with Peter.

Gwen is seen then working at Oscorp and meets [[Max Dillon (film character)|Max Dillon]] in an elevator, where she finds out his birthday and the fact that he is obsessed with Spider-Man. She later meets up with Peter again, in which they try to maintain their friendship and establish some "ground rules". Gwen tells Peter that she is trying to apply for a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], meaning she has to move to [[England]] if she gets it. Before the two can discuss it, Max, having suffered an industrial accident and become Electro, shuts off the power to Times Square whilst looking for electricity to power himself. Gwen recognizes Max and starts asking questions; Donald Menken, a high ranking and mutinous Oscorp board member, decides that she is a threat, fires her and targets her for elimination. In the chaos, she also encounters Peter's childhood best friend [[Harry Osborn (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Harry Osborn]].

Gwen later leaves Peter a voicemail, saying that she got the position at Oxford and has to leave early for a flight. Peter catches up to her and declares his love for her, agreeing to accompany her to England. They are interrupted by an intentional blackout caused by Electro. Peter takes Gwen down where the police are and Gwen helps him with his web-shooters to go against Electro. Peter heads off to fight with Electro having the upper-hand. As Electro has Spider-Man in the air and is electrocuting him, Gwen comes in a police car and hits Electro, against Peter's demands. The two defeat and kill Electro by [[overcurrent|overloading]] his electricity supply.

Just after they do so, Harry arrives, now as the [[Green Goblin]], having figured out Spider-Man's identity and wanting revenge for being refused a potentially life-saving blood transfusion. Goblin takes Gwen to a clock tower and drops her but Spider-Man catches her. The two fight at the top of the tower, and Spider-Man manages to subdue the Goblin. However, during the fight, Gwen falls and is supported by a web connected to one of the gears. The gear soon gives away, which cuts the web and Gwen again plummets. Goblin is then defeated and Peter tries to save Gwen using his web. Though he successfully catches her inches from the ground, she dies nonetheless due to [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] causing her head to hit the floor. Devastated by his failure to save Gwen, Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.

Five months pass and Spider-Man is nowhere to be seen in New York as Peter spends every day at Gwen's grave. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich dubs himself the "Rhino" and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by re-watching Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man and confronts him.{{efn|After Peter is temporarily transported to [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|an alternate reality]] in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', he reveals that Gwen's death still haunts him and that he became more brutal while fighting crime. Later on, Peter achieves his redemption when he manages to catch the other [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter]]'s girlfriend [[MJ (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|MJ]] as she is falling, preventing her from meeting the same fate as Gwen. He returns to his universe as a happier and more optimistic man.}}

==Comic appearances==
===Marvel Infinite tie-in comics===
Gwen appears in comics that tie into both films in the series, helping Peter redesign his Spider-Man suit and attempting to maintain a friendship with him after their initial breakup before resuming their relationship.

==In other media==
===Video games===
*This version of the character also appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' movie video game, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. Several months after the film, Gwen continues to work at Oscorp, and occasionally provides assistance to Spider-Man.
*Gwen Stacy does not appear in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' movie video game, but is mentioned by Peter Parker while speaking to his Aunt May when he excuses himself to leave the house and pretend to check up on Gwen during an attack on Oscorp (when in reality, she wasn't present at the incident). [[Beenox]] confirmed that the character was excluded from the plot so the game doesn't generate spoilers for the then-upcoming film.

==Reception==
Emma Stone's performance as Gwen Stacy has received positive reviews and led to wider recognition for the actress, as she was nominated for several awards, winning "Favorite Movie Actress" at the [[2015 Kids' Choice Awards]]. Critics praised Stone's chemistry with [[Andrew Garfield]] in both ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' and ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'', and the fact that her character was significantly more fleshed-out than the Gwen Stacy of the Sam Raimi trilogy.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-amazing-spiderman-20120702,0,6500728.story | title= Review: 'The Amazing Spider-Man's' Peter and Gwen are super | work= Los Angeles Times | date=July 2, 2012 | access-date=July 2, 2012 | first = Kenneth | last=Turan | author-link = Kenneth Turan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-03-22 |title=Spider-Man: 5 Best Versions Of Gwen Stacy (& 5 Worst) |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-best-worst-versions-gwen-stacy/ |access-date=2020-08-16 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref> In a review of the first film, Stephanie Zacharek of [[Movieline]] wrote that she "had no specific desire to see the series resuscitated.
