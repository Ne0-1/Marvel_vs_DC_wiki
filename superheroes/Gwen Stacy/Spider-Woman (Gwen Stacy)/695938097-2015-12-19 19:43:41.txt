'''Spider-Woman''' ([[Gwen Stacy]]) or commonly referred to as '''Spider-Gwen''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] fictional character that debuted in ''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #2 as part of the 2014–15 [[Spider-Man]] event ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' [[comic book]]. Her debut was exceedingly popular. After her debut, she would star in an [[ongoing series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] named ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' beginning February 2015. The series explores her universe of Earth-65, where, instead of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], Gwen Stacy was bitten by the radioactive spider, forcing her into a career as the Spider-Woman of her world.

==Publication history==
A spider-powered Gwen Stacy was first conceptualized by long-time Spider-Man writer [[Dan Slott]] for the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' event; however, his initial concept was very different from what was published, which was mainly the work of ''Spider-Gwen'' creators [[Jason Latour]] and Robbi Rodriguez. He said "In my head, I lived with this character for a year, and the visual I had for her was pretty much ''[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]'' outfit, but all red and blue with web patterns and a half mask.<ref name=design>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/slott-details-the-unexpected-origins-of-spider-gwen-and-spider-punk Slott Details the Unexpected Origins of Spider-Gwen and Spider-Punk]</ref> <ref name="Edge of Spider-Verse">{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Robbie|title=Meet Gwen Stacy, Spider-Woman, in Edge of Spider-Verse #2|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/23143/meet_gwen_stacy_spider-woman_in_edge_of_spider-verse_2||website=[[Marvel.com]]|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
In the alternate reality designated Earth-65, Gwen Stacy is the one bitten by the radioactive spider, and becomes a superhero going by the name of [[Spider-Woman#Other versions|Spider-Woman]]. She is also a member of a band fronted by Mary Jane Watson, simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after Gwen begins fighting crime, Peter Parker attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him, becoming this universe's version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her father, who is also a police chief in this world, begins a hunt for her. This follows Gwen into college, where she is still a member of the Mary Janes. At a gig of theirs, an assassin is sent after Gwen's father, who is in the audience. Gwen defeats the assassin, the audience and band clearing out during the battle. While they are alone, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen taking off her mask to reveal who she is. Shocked upon learning Spider-Woman's identity, he tells her to run before he changes his mind. In the distance, the Captain Britain from Earth-833 called Spider-UK is watching, saying that Gwen will "do quite nicely."<ref>''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #2. Marvel Comics</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, Gwen is recruited by Spider-UK to team up with other Spider-Totems across the multiverse, and next appears on Earth-616 with [[Ezekiel (comics)|Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4]] and [[Bullet Points (comics)|Spider-Man of Earth-70105]] (who in that reality is [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]]) to rescue [[Kaine]], who was under attack by the Inheritors.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #9.

Marvel Comics</ref>

After the events of ''Spider-Verse'', Gwen returns to her home of Earth-65 where she continues her career as Spider-Woman in her own solo series, ''Spider-Gwen''. She begins a hunt for the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] who has been terrorizing the city in her absence while trying to make amends with her fellow band members following her lengthy absence,<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #1–2</ref> but ended up being attacked in her own home by the Vulture, and having her secret identity exposed to police captain [[Punisher|Frank Castle]].<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #3</ref> Afterwards, Gwen is able to make some peace with Peter's death after a talk with his [[Uncle Ben]] and [[Aunt May]], and returns to her band.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #4–5</ref>

===Secret Wars===
On the [[Battleworld]] domain of Arachnia during the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Gwen finds herself wandering around New York aimlessly as a superhero while trying to remember her life. She begins investigating and discovers that she was apparently murdered by Mayor [[Norman Osborn]], [[Spider-Man]]'s arch enemy before Spider-Man disappeared years ago. Gwen sneaks into Oscorp to discover a file in one of their tablets titled "[[Sinister Six]]," which contains pictures of Gwen, Anya, Pavitr, Billy, and two more spider-people [[Spider-Ham]] and [[Marvel Noir|Spider-Man Noir]]. Snooping around some more, Gwen finds Spider-Ham hooked up to several machines until she is caught by Mayor Norman Osborn.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' vol. 2 #1</ref>

The duo escaped from the building after being discovered by Mayor Norman Osborn and was later found by Spider-Man India, [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and Spider-UK. The Spider-Man India brought them to his hideout in Chinatown where he had devised a machine to track the exotic resonances of the spider-heroes in this dimension, the device subsequently picked up another Spider. The signal brought the spider-heroes to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]. Once there, they stopped the criminals [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], and discovered the origin of the signal in the form of the Spider-Man Noir of Earth-90214. The spiders were soon interrupted by the arrival of the [[Sinister Six]] (consisting of [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], Sandman, Scorpion, and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]).<ref>''Spider-Verse'' vol. 2 #2</ref>
