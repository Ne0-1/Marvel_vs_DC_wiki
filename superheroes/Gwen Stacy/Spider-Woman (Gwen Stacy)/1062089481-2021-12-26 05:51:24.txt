'''Spider-Woman''' ('''[[Gwen Stacy|Gwendolyne Maxine Stacy]]'''; [[colloquial]]: '''"Spider-Gwen"''' or '''"Ghost-Spider"''') is a [[superhero|superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She was created by [[Jason Latour]] and Robbi Rodriguez. The character debuted in ''[[Edge of Spider-Verse]]'' issue #2 as part of the 2014–15 "[[Spider-Verse]]" [[comic book]] storyline, leading to the ongoing series ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' that began in 2015.

Spider-Woman is a [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|variant]] of [[Spider-Man]] and an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe version]] of Gwen Stacy. She lives on [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#List of main alternate Earths and universes|Earth-65]], where Gwen Stacy is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes a superheroine instead of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man. The character's various enemies include Earth-65 versions of [[Kingpin (Matt Murdock)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]]. Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman harbors much of Peter's personality and conflicts along with his powers and abilities.

Spider-Woman was met with positive reviews from critics, with them applauding her design—cited as a popular choice for [[cosplay]]—and a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective. For promotion, several other versions of the character were developed, accompanied by merchandise. She was also featured on animated television series and in multiple video games as a playable character. [[Dove Cameron]] voices the character in the 2018–19 ''[[Marvel Rising]]'' [[media franchise]] as "Ghost-Spider", an alias later integrated into the comics, while [[Hailee Steinfeld]] voices [[Gwen Stacy (Spider-Verse)|the character]] in the [[Spider-Verse (franchise)|''Spider-Verse'' film series]]; [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]], [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]], [[Emily Tennant]], Catherine Luciani and Allegra Clark have also provided the character's voice in other media.

After losing her powers, Gwen's seeks aid from the corrupt [[Kingpin (Matt Murdock)|Matt Murdock]] (This universe's version of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]) and scientist Elsa Brock. It's discovered that combining the mutagenic Lizard serum with isotopes can form a version of the Venom symbiote. Gwen bonds with Elsa Brock's symbiote, restoring her abilities.

Back on Earth-65, Gwen tries to return to her normal life of superhero activities, drumming with the Mary Janes, and attempting to rekindle her relationships with friend Harry Osborn and her father George. Without her secret identity, things prove challenging, leading to judgments from the public and regular attacks by criminals like the [[Man-Wolf]]. Additionally, her symbiote starts causing massive headaches while dropping parts of itself as "gummy spiders." Since Elsa Brock has disappeared from public life, Gwen travels to Earth-616 to find her counterpart Eddie Brock. Peter Parker of Earth-616, now a teacher at Empire State University, volunteers to analyze the symbiote since his world's Eddie Brock is not a scientist. The two heroes then save people from the villain Swarm and Gwen is asked who she is. Since this universe already has a Spider-Woman, Gwen decides she needs a new name. Considering how so many of her multiverse counterparts are dead, as if "Death loves Gwen Stacy," she decides to adopt her "Ghost-Spider" nickname as a new official alias.<ref>''Spider-Gwen: Ghost Spider'' Vol. 1 #1–10, 2019</ref>

Realizing her secret identity is intact in this dimension, Gwen decides to attend college peacefully on Earth-616 without worrying about villains attacking. With Peter's help, she enrolls in Empire State University, explaining to school admissions that she comes from another dimension. This, along with her test records and Parker vouching for her, earns Gwen enrollment and a scholarship that applies to visitors from other worlds and dimensions. Gwen begins regularly attending classes while "commuting" back and forth from her own Earth, regularly encountering Peter. In costume, she fights menaces on both worlds, including Miles Warren, whose unhealthy obsession with the Earth-616 Gwen Stacy led to him becoming the villainous Jackal.<ref>''Ghost Spider Vol. 1'' #1, 2019</ref>

==Characteristics==
Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman is depicted as harboring much of [[Earth-616]] Peter Parker's personality and conflicts, such as receiving negative media attention of herself and having the conflict of being a superheroine over her normal life of a band member.<ref name="Kotaku"/> Critical commentary noted her as a sarcastic, wisecracking heroine when fighting criminals and [[supervillain]]s.<ref name="Kotaku"/> ''Spider-Gwen'' (Vol. 2) #1's summary of the character reveals that she originally used her powers for attention. After advice expressed to Gwen Stacy by her father that Spider-Woman could use her powers for good purposes, she was motivated to stop bullying, which Peter Parker in Earth-65 was a victim of.<ref name="Samantha"/> Spider-Woman eventually became an idol to Peter and he used an experimentation on himself to become a superhero like her,<ref name="Samantha"/> leading to his demise. Gwen Stacy was branded a criminal after Peter's death, having been blamed for killing him.<ref name="Samantha"/> Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] felt that this aspect was the most intriguing change of her story, "[Peter Parker becomes] both Gwen's first major villain and the defining, [[Uncle Ben|Uncle-Ben]]-style tragedy in her life."<ref name="IGN"/> Evan Narcisse from ''[[Kotaku]]'' explained that it was a role reversal that felt "enriching" to what the creators attended to do, which gave Gwen Stacy "a reason to live".<ref name="Kotaku"/> After saving her father's life and revealing her identity to him, she vows to use her powers to stop crime.<ref name="Samantha"/> Captain Stacy is then depicted as choosing his daughter over his job. Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] opined that even though Captain Stacy is no Uncle Ben, he fills the wise mentor role for Gwen very well.<ref name="Color"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Spider-Woman was originally depicted as having similar powers to Spider-Man, which originated from a bite by a radioactive spider.<ref name="debut"/> These powers include superhuman speed, agility,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/spider-woman-gwen-stacy/in-comics|title=GWEN STACY / SPIDER-GWEN|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|access-date=April 1, 2021|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220205609/https://www.marvel.com/characters/spider-woman-gwen-stacy/in-comics}}</ref> enhanced strength that enables her to lift about 10 tons,<ref name="Samantha"/> the ability to adhere to surfaces such as walls, and a precognitive "Spider-Sense" that warns her of danger. She uses web-shooters that were created by retired crime fighter and billionaire mogul [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]].<ref name="debut"/><ref name="Samantha"/> The mechanisms help filter moisture from the air to create an adhesive web-fluid, which itself creates web nets, ropes and globs, among other shapes. They also help her swing from building to building, not requiring refilling as long as moisture is present.<ref name="Samantha"/><ref name="debut"/> Spider-Woman also has a wristwatch that allows her travel to [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|the multiverse]] after the events of "Spider-Verse". She is commonly depicted as using her [[smartphone]] for superhero equipment.<ref name="Samantha"/> As the daughter of a police captain, Spider-Woman has developed detective skills and analytical thinking. She is not trained in fighting, but has picked up elements from kung fu films.<ref name="Samantha"/>

The character is eventually depicted as depowered, but regains her powers after bonding with her universe's version of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote. Her symbiote feeds off the nutrients of her body but if it does not consume the correct nutrients, Gwen's powers become unstable. To help keep her symbiote stable, Gwen often eats extra food and has made kale chips a regular part of her diet, since the symbiote responds well to cellulose.<ref>''Spider-Gwen'' #25.

The character has drawn critical attention on a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective. Aja Romano of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' felt that the new take on Gwen Stacy was a fresh one on its original version due to a common trope of women dying for the sake of men's angst.

She is later chosen by Morales to continue being their universe's Spider hero while the Morales family move to Parker's universe.

* Spider-Gwen, as Ghost-Spider, appears in the ''[[Marvel Rising]]'' animated media franchise, voiced again by Dove Cameron. While this version is primarily based on Stacy, the character uses an alias originating in comics used for a [[Ghost Rider]] variant of Spider-Man rather than the comic book aliases of Spider-Woman and Spider-Gwen and has the partially dyed pink hair of [[Gwenpool|Gwen Poole]] in her civilian identity. This redesign was cited by a ''Marvel Rising'' character designer, who mistook an image of Gwen Poole by [[Gurihiru]] for Gwen Stacy while using [[Google Images]] to reference the former character's physical appearance during the series' development. The "Ghost-Spider" alias was later integrated into [[Marvel Comics]] and related animated Spider-Man media to distinguish the character from [[Spider-Woman|other Spider-Women]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/tv/81626/marvel-to-launch-new-animation-franchise-marvel-rising/|title=MARVEL TO LAUNCH NEW ANIMATION FRANCHISE 'MARVEL RISING'|date=December 7, 2017|website=Marvel.com|access-date=December 10, 2017|archive-date=December 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208004045/https://news.marvel.com/tv/81626/marvel-to-launch-new-animation-franchise-marvel-rising/|url-status=dead}}</ref>
