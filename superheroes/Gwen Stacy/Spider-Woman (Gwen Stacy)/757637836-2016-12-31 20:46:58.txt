'''Spider-Woman''' ('''[[Gwen Stacy]]'''), commonly referred to as '''Spider-Gwen''', is a fictional [[superhero]] in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Jason Latour]] and Robbi Rodriguez, the character debuted in ''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #2, as part of the 2014â€“15 ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' [[comic book]] storyline. This led to the ongoing series ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' that began in 2015.

The character is a [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|variant]] of [[Spider-Man]] and an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe version]] of [[Gwen Stacy]]. She resides in what Marvel official nomenclature dubs Earth-65, where, instead of Peter Parker being bitten by a radioactive spider and becoming Spider-Man, Gwen Stacy instead is bitten and becomes the superhero Spider-Woman.

The character is featured in other alternate universes and appears in other Marvel media such as an animated television series and video games, and in merchandise such as action figures.

In the [[Earth-616|primary continuity]] of the comic books comprising the [[Marvel Universe]], college-student [[Gwen Stacy]] was the girlfriend of Peter Parker, whom she was unaware was also [[Spider-Man]]. This primary version of Gwen Stacy was killed in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #121 ([[cover-date]]d June 1973).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Michael|title=Marvel Brings Spider-Man's Dead Girlfriend Back to Life|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/spider-gwen-brings-iconic-spider-man-girlfriend-back/story?id=29244084|website=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=September 3, 2016|date=February 26, 2015|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20151213174558/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/spider-gwen-brings-iconic-spider-man-girlfriend-back/story?id=29244084|archivedate=December 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Andy|title=Spiderman's Dead Girlfriend Is A Kick-Ass Superhero Now|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/26/spider-gwen_n_6757768.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=3 September 2016|date=26 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317110819/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/26/spider-gwen_n_6757768.html|archivedate=March 17, 2016}}</ref> The concept of an alternate-universe, spider-powered Gwen Stacy was first conceptualized by longtime Spider-Man writer [[Dan Slott]] for the "[[Spider-Verse]]" story arc across multiple series.<ref name="design">{{cite web|last1=Ching|first1=Albert|title=Slott Details the Unexpected Origins of Spider-Gwen and Spider-Punk|url=http://www.cbr.com/slott-details-the-unexpected-origins-of-spider-gwen-and-spider-punk/|publisher=[[ComicBookResources.com]]|accessdate=September 9, 2016|date=March 13, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909235327/http://www.cbr.com/slott-details-the-unexpected-origins-of-spider-gwen-and-spider-punk/|archivedate=September 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Andy|title='Spider-Gwen' puts female spin on an icon|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/02/25/spider-gwen-comic-book-exclusive-preview/23982725/|website=[[USA Today]]|accessdate= September 3, 2016|date=February 25, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716065749/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/02/25/spider-gwen-comic-book-exclusive-preview/23982725/|archivedate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Slott had suggested "Gwen Stacy as a [[Spider-Woman]]" to Spider-Man editor [[Nick Lowe (comics)|Nick Lowe]], who then approached Jason Latour to write a series based on that character.

Latour was inspired with helping create the character when he originally asked himself what he really knew about Gwen Stacy outside of being a  "fridged"{{efn|The term "fridged" was coined by comic book writer [[Gail Simone]]. It's derived when [[Green Lantern]] ([[Kyle Rayner]]'s) [[Alexandra DeWitt|girlfriend]] was killed by being [[Women in Refrigerators|stuffed in a refrigerator]] which motivated Rayner's career as a superhero.<ref name="Nerdist"/>}} character who got killed off for the sake of the hero as a plot progression. Which he felt like wasn't a whole lot.<ref name="USA Today"/> Latour also felt like he grew up in times where white males were dominant in superhero comics. So Latour saw Gwen as a potential heroine to better represent women saying,  "The fact that it's a woman does change the meaning and subtext of everything that's going on. As a creator, that's really enjoyable and it opens up the story to go in a lot of directions it wouldn't have gone before.<ref name="USA Today"/>

==Fictional character biography==
In the alternate reality designated Earth-65, Gwen Stacy is the one bitten by the radioactive spider and becomes a superhero going by the name of [[Spider-Woman]]. She is also a member of a band alongside [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Betty Brant]] and [[Glory Grant]], simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after Gwen begins fighting crime. Peter Parker attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him in [[Midtown High School]], becoming Earth-65's universe's initial version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. [[George Stacy|Her father]], who is also a police chief, begins a hunt for her along with  [[Punisher|Captain Frank Castle]] and Detective [[Jean DeWolff]]. At a gig of the Mary Janes playing, an assassin named [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]] (hired by [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s top advisor and corrupt lawyer, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]]) is sent after Gwen's father, who is in the audience. Gwen defeats the assassin, the audience and band clearing out during the battle. While they are alone, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen taking off her mask to reveal who she is. Shocked upon learning Spider-Woman's identity, he tells her to run before he changes his mind. In the distance, the [[Captain Britain Corps|Captain Britain]] from Earth-833 called [[Spider-UK]] is watching, saying that Gwen will "do quite nicely."<ref name="debut">{{Cite comic|writer = [[Jason Latour|Latour, Jason]] |penciller = Rodriguez, Robbie |inker = Rodriguez, Robbie |story = Gwen Stacy: Spider-Woman  |colorist= Renzi, Rico |letterer= Cowles, Clayton |title = Edge of Spider-Verse |volume =1 |issue = #2 |date = September 17, 2014 |publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|editor=[[Nick Lowe|Lowe, Nick]]}}</ref>

After the events of "Spider-Verse", Gwen returns to her home of Earth-65 where she continues her career as Spider-Woman in her own solo series, ''[[Spider-Gwen]]''.

On the [[Battleworld]] domain of Arachnia during the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Gwen finds herself wandering around New York aimlessly as a superhero while trying to remember her life. She begins investigating and discovers that she was apparently murdered by Mayor [[Norman Osborn]], [[Spider-Man]]'s arch enemy before Spider-Man disappeared years ago. Gwen sneaks into Oscorp to discover a file in one of their tablets titled "[[Sinister Six]]", which contains pictures of Gwen, Anya, Pavitr, Billy, and two more spider-people [[Spider-Ham]] and [[Spider-Man Noir]]. Snooping around some more, Gwen finds Spider-Ham hooked up to several machines until she is caught by Mayor Norman Osborn.<ref name="Spiderverse">{{Cite comic|writer = [[Mike Costa|Costa, Mike]], [[Christos Gage|Gage, Christos]] |penciller =Lima Arajuo, Andre   |inker =  Arajuo, Andre Lima|story = |title = Spider-Verse |volume = 2 |issue = #1-5 |date = Julyâ€“November 2015 |publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]|colorist=Rosenberg, Rachelle|letterer=Caramagna, Joe|editor=[[Nick Lowe]], Devin Lewis}}</ref>

The duo escaped from the building after being discovered by Mayor [[Norman Osborn]] and was later found by [[Pavitr Prabhakar|Spider-Man (Pavitr Prabhakar)]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and Spider-UK. Pavitr brought them to his hideout in Chinatown where he had devised a machine to track the exotic resonances of the spider-heroes in this dimension, the device subsequently picked up another Spider. The signal brought the spider-heroes to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]. Once there, they stopped the criminals [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], and discovered the origin of the signal in the form of the Spider-Man Noir of Earth-90214. The spiders were soon interrupted by the arrival of the [[Sinister Six]] (consisting of [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], Sandman, Scorpion, and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]).<ref name="Spiderverse"/>

The Sinister Six defeated the Spider-Men and brought them to Mayor Norman Osborn who stated he wanted to help them and showed no ulterior motives. Mayor Osborn had developed lenses that could focus in fifth-dimensional space and created the mapping of a tattered web that appeared to be the structure of the universe using the resonances of the heroes. All of the Spider-Heroes decided to stay at the Ozcorp Tower except for Gwen. When she went to the Mount Olivet Cemetery to visit the gravestone of her deceased counterpart, she was startled by the arrival of this domain's native Peter Parker who stated that he used to be Spider-Man.<ref name="Spiderverse"/>

Gwen and Peter were soon attacked by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] who was sent by Mayor Osborn to follow Gwen at a discreet distance and Peter (who had lost his powers a long time ago) was captured by him, but Gwen was able to save him and defeat Venom. Afterwards, Gwen devised a plan to bring down Mayor Osborn. Her along with the rest of the Web Warriors eventually defeated Mayor Osborn.<ref name="Spiderverse"/>

Despite being warned off his dogged pursuit of Gwen Stacy (in his belief that she is Spider-woman) by his superiors, Captain Frank Castle is observing the movements of Gwen from afar. Gwen who is wondering if her recent de-powering (at the hands of Cindy Moon from Earth-65) maybe for the best and that her negative public perception is warranted. She is persuaded in having a night out with her friends By Glory Grant. At the close of the night, after being shown a shortcut to the Dollar Dog restaurant she almost attacks a homeless man which prompts her to almost destroy the power-up isotopes charges she has been given that will restore her powers temporarily. Before she can however, The restaurant becomes the location of an attempted armed robbery. Frank Castle, who has maintained his visual of Gwen, is there to prevent the robbery and attempts to apprehend Gwen, but she activates a power-up and manages to hurl Castle through the restaurant window, which is witnessed by her friends (and Mary Jane band members). Gwen flees into the night with a renewed sense of purpose in being Spider-Woman.

The day after the events at the Dollar Dog, Frank seeks help from Kraven the Hunter in his pursuit of Gwen. Gwen, now home after her power-up ended abruptly during the apprehension of a street mugger, reveals to her father, George Stacy, the loss of her powers and her limited number of power-ups. Their home is soon invaded and Gwen and her father are attacked by a succession of animals under the control of Kraven. May Parker, dropping by for a visit, help fight them off, but the attack culminates in Kraven himself besting a powerless (her power-up bracelet broken in the animal attacks) Gwen and removing her mask (which she had quickly donned) while being observed and photographed by Castle from a little distance away. George manages to subdue Castle and destroy his camera. Gwen is released from Kraven's grasp after he is hit by a passing car and George attempts to explain that he has called the police and that he is prepared to turn himself in as an accomplice but that Gwen needs to leave right away. Instead, Gwen renders her father unconscious and flees the scene with him in her arms. Kraven reveals that during the melee he has obtained one of the power-up isotopes which he promises to use to settle his debt to Castle.

When the remaining Siege Perilous piece is found at the police station, Gwen goes to visit her father in order to divert from catching on to the fact that Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid are in the station. This fails when Wolf Spider attacks with Rio Morales as a hostage. After rescuing Rio, Spider-Woman, Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid flee. When Wolf Spider claims the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], Wolf Spider starts to drain the life-force of every spider-based character from an underwater lair where Kid Arachnid and Spider-Woman are among the victims.
