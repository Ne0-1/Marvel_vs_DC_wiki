===Fictional character biography===
Melati Kusuma is a former graduate student of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]. She stole Connors' regenerative lizard serum, modified it to her own [[DNA]] and administered it to herself.
Connors later registered her for the Initiative and she was sent to [[Camp Hammond]]. At the camp she was victim of a training accident; her arm was blown off by [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], whose powers were out of control. The arm regenerates in moments.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #1">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref>. During their "field trip" to [[Texas]] to save the [[President of the United States|President]] from [[HYDRA]] she performed very well<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2</ref>, and was activated for field work. She worked with [[War Machine]] in an attempt to use [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. tech]] to take away [[Spider-Man]]'s powers, just as had been done to [[She-Hulk#World War Hulk|She-Hulk]]<ref>''She-Hulk'' (vol 2) #18</ref>. Spider-Man called her a "dollar-store version of the Lizard" and convinced her she would fail even as she had him pinned down, warning her that her powers would be taken away when he defeated her, which he does by firing a blast of webbing into her face. Komodo was seen begging War Machine not to have her powers removed as she considers her former human identity to be a nobody.  It was also recently revealed that, while in human form, both of her legs are missing below the knee.

During ''[[World War Hulk]]'', when a number of Komodo's teammates broke rank to go and fight the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Komodo chose to follow orders and stay put. Komodo has recently struck up a relationship with fellow trainee [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] even going as far as to show him her true form.

While fighting [[KIA (comics)|KIA]], he used his Tactigon to infect her with poison so potent that it would kill her before she could regenerate.  In a desperate gamble to save her, Hardball used his power to sever her poisoned legs, stopping the poison before it can travel to the rest of her body. Although he manages to save her, this solution is especially painful for her as she is a former amputee who lost her legs once before.

When Komodo completed her Initiative training, she was assigned to [[Arizona]], as a part of the [[Desert Stars]] team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> She later appears with the rest of her new team during the [[Secret Invasion]]. When the new [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] and the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] arrive and identify team member the Blacksmith as a [[Skrull]], Komodo helps them fight and kill the Skrull infiltrator.  As the rest of the Desert Stars team was incapacitated during the fight, Komodo leaves with the 3-D Man and the Skull Kill Krew to travel to Nevada to help Hardball's team and find the Skrull infiltrators on the other Initiative teams.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref>

Hardball later becomes the new leader of [[HYDRA]] and leaves the Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' #1</ref> Komodo insists on accompanying the [[Shadow Initiative]] to take down Hardball in [[Madripoor]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> When the group arrive, Komodo is depowered when Hardball fires a [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. tech]] dart at her, and she is abandoned by her retreating teammates.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #23</ref> Komodo is held in a HYDRA cell, and later freed by the returning Shadow Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24</ref>

Komodo later quits the Shadow Initiative when she learns that Hardball has joined the team. The price for leaving, as laid out by Initiative operative [[Taskmaster]], is to have S.P.I.N. tech take away her powers. She chooses to have her powers removed rather than remain on the same team with Hardball, and is next seen in human form in a wheelchair with no legs.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27</ref> She then joins up with the Avengers Resistance to help them rescue Night Thrasher.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Komodo possesses an accelerated healing factor derived from the Lizard serum created by Dr. Curt Connors<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #1"/>. The serum was created from lizard DNA in an attempt to create a serum capable of granting humans the regenerative properties of lizards. The extent of her healing factor is unknown, but it is shown she is able to regenerate lost limbs in seconds. She also possesses razor-sharp claws on each of her fingers. Unlike Connors she maintains control of her human consciousness when she is in her lizard form, and has the ability to control transformations between human and lizard forms<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref>. This is a result of her being able to perfect the formula to her DNA.  Komodo also appears to have superhuman strength, reflexes, and agility.

===Appearance===
In her lizard form, Komodo has lizard-like features such as her tail, green skin, and spines.

Melati has black hair and appears to be of Asian descent. Her code-name is taken from an [[Komodo dragon|animal]] specific to certain islands in [[Indonesia]] and her name is commonly used by Indonesians (Melati means [[jasmine]], Kusuma means [[flower]] in Javanese language). <ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #3"/>. After willingly revealing her human form to Hardball it is revealed that Melati has lost her legs in an unknown manner. <ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8</ref>. It was later revealed that she lost her legs in a car accident, "Just a stupid kid driving too fast."<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Special'' #1</ref>
