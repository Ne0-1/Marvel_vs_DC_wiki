===Fictional character biography===
Melati is a former graduate student of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]. She stole Connors' regenerative lizard serum, modified it to her own DNA and administered it to herself.
Curt later registered her for the Initiative and she was sent to [[Camp Hammond]]. At the camp she was victim of a training accident; her arm was blown off by [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], whose powers were out of control. The arm regenerates in moments.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref>. During their "field trip" to Texas to save the [[President of the United States|President]] from [[HYDRA]] she performed very well<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2</ref>, and was activated for field work. She worked with [[War Machine]] in an attempt to use [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. tech]] to take away [[Spider-Man]]'s powers, just had been done to [[She-Hulk#World War Hulk|She-Hulk]]<ref>''She-Hulk''(vol 2) #18</ref>. Spider-Man called her a "dollar-store version of the Lizard" and convinced her she would fail even as she had him pinned down, warning her that her powers would be taken away when he defeated her, which he does by firing a blast of webbing into her face. Komodo was seen begging War Machine not to have her powers removed as she considers her former human identity to be a nobody.  It was also recently revealed that she does not have the lower part of her legs in her human form.

Later, during World War Hulk, when a number of Komodo's teammates broke rank to go and fight the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Komodo chose to follow orders and stay put.

===Powers and abilities===
Komodo possesses an accelerated healing factor derived from the Lizard serum created by Dr. Curt Connors<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref>. The serum was created from lizard DNA in an attempt to create a serum capable of granting humans the regenerative properties of lizards. The extent of her healing factor is unknown, but it is shown she is able to regenerate lost limbs in seconds. She also possesses razor-sharp claws on each of her fingers. Unlike Connors she maintains control of her human consciousness when she is in her lizard form, and has the ability to control transformations between human and lizard forms<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref>. This is a result of her being able to perfect the formula to her DNA.  Komodo also appears to have superhuman strength, reflexes, and agility.

===Appearance===
Komodo has lizard-like features such as her tail, green skin, and spines.

Melati has black hair and appears to be of Asian descent. Her name is taken from an animal specific to an island in Indonesia and her name is commonly used by Indonesians (Melati means [[jasmine]] in Malay language). <ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref>.
