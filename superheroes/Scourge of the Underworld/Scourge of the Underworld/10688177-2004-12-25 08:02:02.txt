'''The Scourge of the Underworld''' is the name of a series of [[fictional character]]s who have appeared in various series set in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The Scourge would appear, usually in disguise, execute a minor [[supervillain]], shout "Justice is served!", and disappear.

The Scourge first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #194 ([[1986]]) and made single-issue appearances in most of Marvel's series published at the time, although the bulk of his story was told in ''[[Captain America]]'' #318-320.  The Scourge of the Underworld first surfaced as a [[taxicab]] driver who unexpectedly executed a villain leaving the scene of a crime, and most of the Scourge's other assassinations were committed under similar disguises.  His most infamous appearance was in ''Captain America'' #319, in which he killed over a dozen minor supervillains at the "Bar With No Name".  According to the Scourge in ''Captain America'' #320, he was the brother of the Enforcer, a minor villain who had been one of his first victims.  The Scourge making this confession was then executed by another Scourge, and that Scourge was later killed by yet another Scourge.  This last Scourge also killed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent who had used the identity of the [[Red Skull]] in the [[1950s]].  It was revealed in ''Captain America'' #350 that the Scourge had been financed by the original Red Skull, who had been believed dead at the time but had actually survived in a body that was [[clone]]d from Captain America's [[DNA]].

Years later, in the ''[[USAgent]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Scourge was an identity used by several people, all of whom were financed by the original Angel, a hero from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] who had been driven to [[vigilantism]] in recent years.  USAgent and the [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] fought the Scourges, including one who had claimed to be the USAgent's brother.  In the end, the Angel died (although he was survived by a brother who had also used the identity of the Angel) and the remaining Scourges were defeated and arrested.

In the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', a new Scourge appeared; this one assassinated the Thunderbolts members [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], [[Baron Zemo]] and [[Techno (comics)|Techno]], as well as several civilians.  It was revealed that this Scourge was actually Jack Munroe, alias [[Bucky]] and [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], who was being mentally controlled by the [[superhuman]]-hating government agent [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]; Gyrich himself was being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]].  Munroe was being defeated and freed from Gyrich's control by the Thunderbolts and their allies, the Redeemers, and apparently abandoned the Scourge equipment and identity after the battle.
