'''The Scourge of the Underworld''' is the name of a series of [[fictional character]]s that have appeared in various series set in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The Scourge would appear, usually in disguise, execute a minor [[supervillain]] (especially ones fans considered ill conceived), shout his catchphrase, "Justice is served!", and disappear.

Unlike a similar character, [[Punisher|The Punisher]], who is usually treated as an [[anti-hero]], The Scourge is unambiguously condemned as a villain (despite the fact that the Scourges kill only villains), and whom the [[superhero]] community, most notably [[Captain America]], is determined to bring to justice.

==Fictional character biography==
The Scourge first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #194 (1986) and made single-issue appearances in most of Marvel's series published at the time, although the bulk of his story was told in ''[[Captain America]]'' #318-320. The Scourge of the Underworld first surfaced as an old lady who unexpectedly executed a villain leaving the scene of a crime, and most of the Scourge's other assassinations were committed under similar disguises. His most infamous appearance was in ''Captain America'' #319, in which he killed over a dozen minor supervillains at "the Bar With No Name" (see below).

According to the Scourge in ''Captain America'' #320, he was the brother of the Enforcer, a minor villain who had been his first victim and received information on villains from his private detective, [[Domino (Dominic Dunsinane)|Domino]]. The Scourge making this confession was then executed by another Scourge, and that Scourge was later killed by yet another Scourge. This last Scourge also killed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent who had used the identity of the [[Red Skull]] in the 1950s. It was revealed in ''Captain America'' #350 that the Scourge had been financed by the original Red Skull, who had been believed dead at the time but had actually survived in a body that was [[cloning|clone]]d from Captain America's [[DNA]].

Years later, in the ''[[U.S. Agent]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Scourge was an identity used by several people, all of whom were financed by the original [[Angel (Timely Comics)|Angel]], a hero from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] who had been driven to [[vigilante|vigilantism]] in recent years. U.S. Agent and the [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] fought the Scourges, including one who had claimed to be the U.S. Agent's brother. In the end, the Angel died (although he was survived by a brother who had also used the identity of the Angel), Domino died, and the remaining Scourges were defeated and arrested.

The Red Skull's minion [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] was at one time sent by the Skull to recruit the villains [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] II and [[Blackwing#Blackwing (Joseph Manfredi)|Blackwing]] for his pool of underlings, loosely titled '''The [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]]'''. She used her illusion-casting abilities to generate the image of the Scourge, who then "shot and killed" both villains, in reality, simply fooling [[Captain America]] so as to allow her to escape with the criminals.  The primary writer and conceiver of the Scourge plotline as well as the Captain America storyline, Mark Gruenwald, had often expressed some disappointment in what he saw as the short-sightedness in killing so many potentially "fun" villains rather than re-imagining or improving them. 

The Scourge played a major role in the story ''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'', despite the fact that the character never actually appears during the story outside of a dream sequence.  Throughout the events of the story, the [[Shocker (comics)#Shocker I|Shocker]] is stricken with paranoia over the idea that the Scourge will come for him next.  During the climax of the arc, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] employs an unseen Scourge imposter to fake an attempt on the Shocker's life, preventing him from killing [[Spider-Man]] and causing him to flee the scene, all in order to avoid attention being drawn near a location that the Kingpin was having robbed. 

In the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', a new Scourge appeared; this one assassinated the Thunderbolts members [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] and [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Techno]], as well as a pair of civilians (Gayle Rogers and Roberta Haggerty) who were investigating Jolt's death. It was revealed that this Scourge was actually Jack Monroe, alias Bucky and [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], who was being mentally controlled by the [[superhuman]]-hating government agent [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]; Gyrich himself was being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]. Monroe was defeated and freed from Gyrich's control by the Thunderbolts and their allies, the Redeemers. He then, apparently, abandoned the Scourge equipment and identity after the battle.  As Scourge, Monroe had access to a wide array of technology based on equipment confiscated from super-villains.  Some were installed in the costume he wore, while several others were miniaturized using [[Henry Pym#Powers and abilities|Pym particles]] and stored in one of the costume's [[gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]s; all were accessible by a voice-coded system.  Specific items used included versions of the [[Green Goblin]]'s [[Goblin glider|glider]], the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]]'s helmet-installed energy projector, and [[Stilt-Man]]'s telescoping legs, as well as various unspecified weaponry, including a metal [[quarterstaff]].  He could also access his gauntlet's Pym particles to alter the size of himself or others, though excessive use of this ability on the Thunderbolt [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] forced him to abandon much of his weapon stores when his supply of Pym particles was spent.

Three characters bearing the names of the Scourge's previous victims - [[Hellrazor#Caged Angels|Hellrazor]], Caprice, and [[Mind-Wave#Caged Angels|Mindwave]] (minus the hyphen) - appeared in ''Thunderbolts'' #116. Caprice and Mindwave appeared along with [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]] and [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]] as supervillains incarcerated in Thunderbolts Mountain in ''Thunderbolts'' #117 telepathically discussing a plot against the Thunderbolts.

== The Punisher, Scourge of the Underworld ==
Spinning out of the events of the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], the vigilante anti-hero [[Punisher|The Punisher]] has widened his targets to the throngs of super-villains that either rampage with impunity or are working as registered operatives following the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. The Punisher is referred to by both criminals and various solicitations for [[The Punisher War Journal]] comic book as "The Scourge of the Underworld". In his capacity as a villain-killer, Punisher has slain such villains as [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]], [[Plunderer]], and the original [[Stilt-Man]], though it was later revealed that the Plunderer had survived his seemingly fatal injuries.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' vol.II #4</ref> In a move that harkens back to the Bar with No Name incident, Punisher infiltrated the pub where Stilt-Man's wake was held, poisoned the attendees, and then blew up the villain-filled bar. Several of the apparent victims include:

* [[Absorbing Man]]
* [[Answer (comics)|Answer]]
* [[Armada (Marvel Comics)|Armada]]
* [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]]

* [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] II
* [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]
* [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]]
* [[Xandu (comics)|Xandu]]

However, ''She-Hulk'' (volume 2) #17 later revealed that all of these victims were treated at the hospital for third-degree burns, had their stomachs pumped, and survived.

==Villains killed in the Bar With No Name==
In ''[[Captain America]]'' #319, the Scourge was disguised as the bartender of "the [[Bar With No Name]]," a super-villain hang-out. A number of villains had gathered there that evening to organize a concerted effort to stop the Scourge, all at the urgings of villain "manager" Gary Gilbert, formerly a villain called [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]].

Security equipment that Gilbert borrowed from the gadget-villain called the [[Tinkerer]] was ineffective in detecting the Scourge, as no one thought to scan the bartender, and eighteen villains were killed, including Gilbert himself, in the second panel from the end of the issue. The villains had no chance against Scourge due to a "no weapons policy" in the "Bar With No Name."
