'''The Scourge of the Underworld''' is the name of a series of [[fictional character]]s that have appeared in various series set in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

Writer/editor [[Mark Gruenwald]] originally created the Scourge in 1985 as a plot device intended to thin the criminal population of the Marvel Universe, in particular eliminating those [[supervillain]] characters he deemed to be too minor, redundant, or ill-conceived.{{fact|date=August 2013}}  Since that time, other writers have expanded upon the concept and fleshed out the Scourge's backstory.

==Organization==
The Scourge is originally depicted as an individual [[vigilante]] dedicated to the assassination of criminals. This person, whose true name has never been revealed, is seen over the course of several months murdering known supervillains. The Scourge approaches a supervillain in disguise, shoots him or her with an explosive-tipped bullet, shouts his [[catchphrase]] ("Justice is served!"), and disappears. This first Scourge's killing spree reaches its apex in ''Captain America'' #319, where he guns down eighteen such criminals at an underworld meeting which is, ironically, held to devise a way of countering the menace of the Scourge. The Scourge disguises himself as the bartender, who nobody thinks to search. When Captain America captures the Scourge in the following issue, the character claimed to be the brother of the [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]], whom Scourge has killed because his sibling's criminal activities has shamed their father. He claims that this crime led to him creating the Scourge persona with help from a private investigator only identified as "Domino", who provides him detailed information on the supervillain community. Immediately after making this confession, the Scourge is himself shot and killed by an unseen assailant, who is heard to cry "Justice is served!" in the fashion of the Scourge's other killings.

Some time later, in ''Captain America'' #350, it is revealed that the Scourge is actually the creation of the [[Red Skull]], who states that he created the Scourge as his personal assassin, with Albert Malik, the communist villain who assumed the identity of the Red Skull during the 1950s, as one of this version's confirmed kills. This is apparently a ruse by the Skull, as during the 1994 ''[[U.S. Agent]]'' miniseries, it is suggested that the Scourge is ultimately an identity used by several people, all of whom were financed by the original [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]], a hero from the [[World War II]] era of Marvel Comics, who has been driven to [[vigilante|vigilantism]]. His Scourge agents operate through subterfuge to get close to targets, then kill them.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

The organization operates through behind the scenes direction by Angel, and under him are several individual Scourge agents capable of autonomous action. A man named [[Domino (Dominic Dunsinane)|Domino]] works for the organization, but the identities of most Scourges are unknown, with the exceptions of [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]], [[Caprice (comics)|Caprice]], and [[Bloodstain (comics)|Bloodstain]]. A member must be a legal adult willing to submit to thorough investigation of his or her personal background and swear an oath of loyalty to the principles of the Scourge organization. Any Scourge attempting to reveal the existence of the organization will be assassinated by another member.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

When not in disguise, a Scourge wears an all-white coat and hat, and a skull-like mask. Most Scourges are armed with a .50 cal Thompson machine gun with a sawed-off barrel and stock using a special purpose 5-round magazine. Each .50 cal round is equipped with an acceleration activated, delay-triggered explosive shell which exhibits the signature sound of "pum-SPAAK" in the comic book panels. Scourges also use radio devices for communication with Domino, as well as makeup and costumes for disguise.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

===Membership===
The first person identified as a Scourge killed several supervillains, including the [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]],<ref>''[[Iron Man]]'' #194</ref> [[Miracle Man]],<ref>''[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'' #24</ref> [[Hate-Monger#Other versions|Hate Monger III]],<ref>''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #2</ref> [[Melter]],<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #263</ref> [[Titania (Grapplers)|Titania I]],<ref>''[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'' #33</ref> [[Basilisk (comics)#Basilisk (Basil Elks)|Basilisk]],<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #289</ref> [[Human Fly (comics)#The Human Fly (Richard Deacon)|The Human Fly]],<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #276</ref> [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] and [[Blue Streak (comics)#Blue Streak (Don Thomas)|Blue Streak]].<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #318</ref> This Scourge was also responsible for the "Bar With No Name" massacre, in which he killed 18 supervillains.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #319</ref> This Scourge is eventually unmasked and defeated by [[Captain America]]. According to this Scourge, he is the brother of the Enforcer, his first victim, and receives information on villains from his private detective [[Domino (Dominic Dunsinane)|Domino]]. The Scourge making this confession is then executed by the second known person to use the Scourge identity.<ref>''Captain America'' #320</ref>

The second person identified as a Scourge kills [[Hammer and Anvil (comics)|Hammer and Anvil]],<ref>''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #29</ref> and the [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|The Wraith]] (Brian DeWolff),<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #278</ref> before killing the Scourge who talks to Captain America, and some time later, he kills a member of the [[The Watchdogs|Watchdogs]].<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #351</ref> This Scourge is captured by the [[U.S. Agent]] and killed by another Scourge.<ref>''Captain America'' #358-364</ref>

A third, renegade Scourge kills the Soviet agent who uses the identity of the [[Red Skull#Albert Malik|Red Skull]] (Albert Malik) in the 1950s.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #347</ref> This Scourge attempts to kill the then-current Captain America (later known as the [[U.S. Agent]]). It was revealed that this Scourge has been financed by the original Red Skull, who is believed dead at the time but has actually survived in a body that is [[cloning|cloned]] from Captain America's [[DNA]].<ref>''Captain America'' #350</ref> This Scourge is eventually eliminated by the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' #394</ref>

The fourth person identified as a Scourge is first seen killing the second Scourge, who had been captured by the [[U.S. Agent]].<ref>''Captain America'' #364</ref> When this Scourge is captured by the U.S. Agent, he is killed by yet another Scourge.<ref>''U.S. Agent'' #{{Issue|date=April 2009}}</ref>

The fifth person identified as a Scourge is Priscilla Lyons, also known as [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]]; the sixth Scourge is an agent also known as Caprice, and the seventh Scourge is an agent also known as Bloodstain. Lyons is unable to bring herself to kill the [[Matador (comics)|Matador]] and is targeted by the other Scourges. She seeks the help of U.S. Agent, who captures some of the Scourge agents and confronts the Angel and Domino. Bloodstain dies in combat during this encounter.<ref>''U.S. Agent'' #1-4</ref>

==Appearances==
The Scourge first appears in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #194 (1985) and makes single-issue appearances in most of Marvel's series published at the time, although the bulk of his story is told in ''[[Captain America]]'' #318-320. The Scourge of the Underworld first surfaces as an old lady who unexpectedly executes a villain leaving the scene of a crime, and most of the Scourge's other assassinations are committed under similar disguises. His most famous appearance is in ''Captain America'' #319, in which he kills eighteen minor supervillains at "the Bar With No Name" (see below).

Years later, in the ''[[U.S. Agent]]'' miniseries, U.S. Agent and the [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] fight the Scourges, including one who claims to be the U.S. Agent's brother. In the end, the Angel dies (although he is survived by a brother who also uses the identity of the Angel), Domino dies, and the remaining Scourges are defeated and arrested.

The Red Skull's minion [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] is at one time sent by the Skull to recruit the villains [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] II and [[Blackwing#Blackwing (Joseph Manfredi)|Blackwing]] for his pool of underlings, loosely titled [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|The Skeleton Crew]]. She uses her illusion-casting abilities to generate the image of the Scourge, who then "kills" both villains; in reality, this is a ruse to fool [[Captain America]] so as to allow her to escape with the criminals. The primary writer and creator of the Scourge plotline as well as the Captain America storyline, Mark Gruenwald, had often expressed some disappointment in what he saw as the short-sightedness in killing so many potentially "fun" villains rather than re-imagining or improving them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Scourge plays a major role in the story ''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'', despite the fact that the character never actually appears during the story, outside of a dream sequence. Throughout the events of the story, the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] is stricken with paranoia over the idea that the Scourge will come for him next. During the climax of the arc, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] employs an unseen Scourge imposter to fake an attempt on the Shocker's life, which prevents him from killing [[Spider-Man]] and causes him to flee the scene, all in order to avoid attention being drawn near a location that the Kingpin wants to rob.

In the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', a new Scourge appears; this one assassinates the Thunderbolts members [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] and [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Techno]], as well as a pair of civilians (Gayle Rogers and Roberta Haggerty) who investigate Jolt's death. This Scourge is actually Jack Monroe, alias Bucky and [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], who is being mentally controlled by the [[superhuman]]-hating government agent [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]; Gyrich himself was being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]. Monroe is defeated and freed from Gyrich's control by the Thunderbolts and their allies, the Redeemers. He then, apparently, abandons the Scourge equipment and identity after the battle. As Scourge, Monroe had access to a wide array of technology based on equipment confiscated from super-villains. Some are installed in the costume, while several others are miniaturized using [[Henry Pym#Powers and abilities|Pym particles]] and stored in one of the costume's [[gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlets]]; all are accessible by a voice-coded system. Specific items used include versions of the [[Green Goblin]]'s [[Goblin glider|glider]], the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]]'s helmet-installed energy projector, and [[Stilt-Man]]'s telescoping legs, as well as various unspecified weaponry, including a metal [[quarterstaff]]. He could also access his gauntlet's Pym particles to alter the size of himself or others, though excessive use of this ability on the Thunderbolt [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] forced him to abandon much of his weapon stores when his supply of Pym particles was spent.

Three characters bearing the names of the Scourge's previous victims – [[Hellrazor#Caged Angels|Hellrazor]], Caprice, and [[Mind-Wave#Caged Angels|Mindwave]] (minus the hyphen) – appeared in ''Thunderbolts'' #116. Caprice and Mindwave appeared along with [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]] and [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]] as supervillains incarcerated in Thunderbolts Mountain in ''Thunderbolts'' #117 telepathically discussing a plot against the Thunderbolts. Caprice, Mindwave, Mirage, and Bluestreak are all killed in their cells by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in ''Thunderbolts'' #121.

After the [[Punisher]] fails to assassinate Osborn due to the intervention of [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Osborn asks the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to hunt him down.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #1</ref> In ''[[Punisher]]'' #5, the Hood is granted the powers of the Dark Dimension by his master [[Dormammu]] to revive eighteen murdered criminals ([[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] I, [[Bird-Man]] II, [[Black Abbott (comics)|Black Abbot]], [[Blue Streak (comics)|Blue Streak]] I, [[Cheetah (Marvel Comics)|Cheetah]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]] I, [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]], [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] I, [[Hijacker (comics)|Hijacker]], [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], [[Letha]], [[Megatak]], [[Mind-Wave]], [[Miracle Man]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Lascivious (comics)|Titania]] I, [[Turner D. Century]], and [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] I) to help him take down the Punisher. Scourge tells the villains that if they fail, they will be returned to their previous states of death and rot.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> The Hood tells these criminals that the Scourge of the Underworld is actually Frank Castle and by killing him they'd be avenging their previous deaths and prolonging their new lives. When Microchip asks if he thinks any of them believed the story, the Hood replies, "Sure they did".<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #6</ref> Several of these villains (including Firebrand, the Wraith, Cyclone and Mirage) are killed again while confronting the Punisher, but ultimately Basilisk and Death Adder subdue the vigilante, and the terms of the Hood's agreement are apparently fulfilled.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

The original Scourge is among the various people in Erebus when [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] travels to the Underworld. He is later seen in [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s jury (alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Armless Tiger Man]], Artume, [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], [[Commander Kraken]], [[Iron Monger]], [[Jack O'Lantern (comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], Kyknos, Nessus, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], and [[Veranke]]) at [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' trial.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

In ''Thunderbolts'' #133, an otherwise unidentified man is christened '''Scourge''' by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and assigned to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. His first mission is to eliminate [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133</ref> This character is later revealed to be [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] with a new identity.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136</ref>

An unknown person under the name of '''Scourge''' joins up with Villains for Hire (the villain counterpart of [[Heroes for Hire]]).<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #1</ref> This Scourge ends up in fact being [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] in disguise, as part of a massive con to take down Purple Man.<ref>''Villains for Hire'' #4</ref>

Another new Scourge is shown to be using a list of the locations of supervillains who have been relocated via the witness protection program and killing them, most recently [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], member of the Serpent Squad. In the battle, he severely injures the hero (and former villain) [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], who recognizes his voice.<ref>''Captain America (vol. 6) #11''</ref> He is then shown to be working for [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], revealed to be under the influence of Hydra. Encountering the villain the [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]], whom Scourge subdues and kills after a short but brutal fight, he pulls off his damaged mask, shattered from the fight, to reveal his identity to be Dennis Dunphy, formerly known as the hero [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]].<ref>''Captain America (vol. 6) #12''</ref>
