'''The Scourge of the Underworld''' is the name of a series of [[fictional character]]s who have appeared in various series set in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The Scourge would appear, usually in disguise, execute a minor [[supervillain]] (especially ones fans considered ill conceived), shout his catchphrase, "Justice is served!", and disappear.

Unlike the character's precursor, [[The Punisher]], who is usually treated as an [[anti-hero]], The Scourge is unambiguously condemned as a villain whom the [[superhero]] community, most notably [[Captain America]], is determined to bring to justice.

==Character history==

The Scourge first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #194 (1986) and made single-issue appearances in most of Marvel's series published at the time, although the bulk of his story was told in ''[[Captain America]]'' #318-320. The Scourge of the Underworld first surfaced as an old lady who unexpectedly executed a villain leaving the scene of a crime, and most of the Scourge's other assassinations were committed under similar disguises. His most infamous appearance was in ''Captain America'' #319, in which he killed over a dozen minor supervillains at "the Bar With No Name" (see below).

According to the Scourge in ''Captain America'' #320, he was the brother of the Enforcer, a minor villain who had been his first victim. The Scourge making this confession was then executed by another Scourge, and that Scourge was later killed by yet another Scourge. This last Scourge also killed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent who had used the identity of the [[Red Skull]] in the 1950s. It was revealed in ''Captain America'' #350 that the Scourge had been financed by the original Red Skull, who had been believed dead at the time but had actually survived in a body that was [[cloning|clone]]d from Captain America's [[DNA]].

Years later, in the ''[[USAgent]]'' miniseries, it was revealed that the Scourge was an identity used by several people, all of whom were financed by the original [[Angel (Golden Age)|Angel]], a hero from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] who had been driven to [[vigilantism]] in recent years. USAgent and the [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] fought the Scourges, including one who had claimed to be the USAgent's brother. In the end, the Angel died (although he was survived by a brother who had also used the identity of the Angel) and the remaining Scourges were defeated and arrested.

It is worth mentioning that The Red Skull's minion Mother Night was at one time sent by the Skull to recruit the villains [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] II and [[Blackwing]] for his pool of underlings, loosely titled '''The Skeleton Crew'''. She used her illusion-casting abilities to generate the image of the Scourge, who then "shot and killed" both villains, in reality, simply fooling [[Captain America]] so as to allow her to escape with the criminals.  The primary writer and conceiver of the Scourge plotline as well as the Captain America storyline, Mark Gruenwald, had often expressed some disappointment in what he saw as the short-sightedness in killing so many potentially "fun" villains rather than re-imagining or improving them. The Mother Night "recruitment" sequence is a likely loop by which various Scourge victims might be "resurrected". 

In the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', a new Scourge appeared; this one assassinated the Thunderbolts members [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], [[Baron Zemo]] and [[Techno (comics)|Techno]], as well as several civilians. It was revealed that this Scourge was actually Jack Monroe, alias [[Bucky]] and [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], who was being mentally controlled by the [[superhuman]]-hating government agent [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]; Gyrich himself was being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]. Monroe was defeated and freed from Gyrich's control by the Thunderbolts and their allies, the Redeemers. He then, apparently, abandoned the Scourge equipment and identity after the battle.

In ''[[Captain America]]'' #319, the Scourge was disguised as the bartender of "the Bar With No Name," a super-villain hang-out.

Security equipment that Gilbert borrowed from the gadget-villain called the [[Tinkerer]] was ineffective in detecting the Scourge, as no one thought to scan the bartender, and eighteen villains were killed, including Gilbert himself, in the second panel from the end of the issue.
