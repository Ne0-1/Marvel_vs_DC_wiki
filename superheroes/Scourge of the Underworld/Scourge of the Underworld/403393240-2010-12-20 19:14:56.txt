'''The Scourge of the Underworld''' is the name of a series of [[fictional character]]s that have appeared in various series set in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  

Writer/editor [[Mark Gruenwald]] originally created the Scourge in 1985 as a plot device intended to thin the criminal population of the Marvel Universe, in particular eliminating those [[supervillain]] characters he deemed to be too minor, redundant, or ill-conceived.  Since that time, other writers have expanded upon the concept and fleshed out the Scourge's backstory.

==Organization==
The Scourge was originally depicted as an individual [[vigilante]] dedicated to the assassination of criminals.  This person, whose true name has never been revealed, was seen over the course of several months murdering known supervillains in cold blood.  The Scourge would approach a supervillain in disguise, shoot him or her with an explosive-tipped bullet, shout his [[catchphrase]] ("Justice is served!"), and disappear.  This first Scourge's killing spree reached its apex in ''Captain America'' #319, where he gunned down eighteen such criminals at an underworld meeting. When Captain America captured the Scourge in the following issue, the character claimed to be the brother of a super-villain known as the Enforcer, who had killed his brother as punishment for the way his sibling's criminal activities had shamed their father.  He claims that this crime led to him creating the Scourge persona with help from a private investigator named "Domino," who provided him detailed information on the supervillain community.  However, immediately after making this confession, the captured man was himself shot and killed by an unseen assailant, who was heard to cry "Justice is served!" in the fashion of the Scourge's other killings.  This was the first solid evidence that there was indeed more than one Scourge.

Some time later, in ''Captain America'' #350, it is revealed that the Scourge is actually the creation of the [[Red Skull]], who states that he created the Scourge as his personal assassin, with Albert Malik, the communist villain who assumed the identity of the Red Skull during the 1950s, as one of this version's confirmed kills. This was apparently a ruse by the Skull, as during the  1994 ''[[U.S. Agent]]'' miniseries, it is suggested that the Scourge is ultimately an identity used by several people, all of whom were financed by the original [[Angel (Timely Comics)|Angel]], a hero from the [[World War II]] era of Marvel Comics, who had been driven to [[vigilante|vigilantism]] in recent years. His Scourge agents operate through subterfuge to get close to targets, then kill them. 

The organization operates through behind the scenes direction by Angel, and under him are several individual Scourge agents capable of autonomous action. A man named [[Domino (Dominic Dunsinane)|Domino]] worked for the organization, but the identities of most Scourges are unknown, with the exceptions of [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]], [[Caprice (comics)|Caprice]], and [[Bloodstain (comics)|Bloodstain]]. A member must be a legal adult willing to submit to thorough investigation of his or her personal background and swear an oath of loyalty to the principles of the Scourge organization. Any Scourge attempting to reveal the existence of the organization would be assassinated by another member.

When not in disguise, a Scourge wears an all-white coat and hat, and a skull-like mask. Most Scourges are armed with a .50 cal Thompson machine gun with a sawed-off barrel and stock using a special purpose 5-round magazine. Each .50 cal round is equipped with an acceleration activated, delay-triggered explosive shell which had the chilling signature sound of "pum-SPAAK" in the comic book panels.  Scourges also use radio devices for communication with Domino, as well as makeup and costumes for disguise.

== Membership ==

According to this Scourge, he was the brother of the Enforcer, his first victim, and received information on villains from his private detective, [[Domino (Dominic Dunsinane)|Domino]]. The Scourge making this confession was then executed by the second known person to use the Scourge identity.<ref>''Captain America'' #320</ref>

The second person identified as a Scourge killed [[Hammer and Anvil (comics)|Hammer and Anvil]],<ref>''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #29</ref> and the [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Wraith (Brian DeWolff)|The Wraith]] (Brian DeWolff),<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #278</ref> before killing the Scourge who talked to Captain America, and some time later, he killed a member of the [[The Watchdogs|Watchdogs]].<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #351</ref> This Scourge was captured by the [[U.S. Agent]] and killed by another Scourge.<ref>''Captain America'' #358-364</ref>

A third, renegade Scourge killed the Soviet agent who had used the identity of the [[Red Skull#Albert Malik|Red Skull]] (Albert Malik) in the 1950s.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #347</ref> This Scourge attempted to kill the then-current Captain America (later known as the [[U.S. Agent]]). It was revealed that this Scourge had been financed by the original Red Skull, who had been believed dead at the time but had actually survived in a body that was [[cloning|cloned]] from Captain America's [[DNA]].<ref>''Captain America'' #350</ref> This Scourge was eventually eliminated by the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' #394</ref>

The fourth person identified as a Scourge was first seen killing the second Scourge, who had been captured by the [[U.S. Agent]].<ref>''Captain America'' #364</ref> When this Scourge was in turn captured by the U.S. Agent, he was in turn killed by yet another Scourge.<ref>''U.S. Agent'' #{{Issue|date=April 2009}}</ref>

The fifth person identified as a Scourge was Priscilla Lyons, also known as [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]]; the sixth Scourge was an agent also known as Caprice, and the seventh Scourge was an agent also known as Bloodstain. Lyons was unable to bring herself to kill the [[Matador (comics)|Matador]], and was thus targeted by the other Scourges. She sought the help of U.S. Agent, who captured some of the Scourge agents, and then confronted the Angel and Domino. Bloodstain was killed in combat during this encounter.<ref>''U.S. Agent'' #1-4</ref>

== Fictional history ==
The Scourge first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #194 (1986) and made single-issue appearances in most of Marvel's series published at the time, although the bulk of his story was told in ''[[Captain America]]'' #318-320. The Scourge of the Underworld first surfaced as an old lady who unexpectedly executed a villain leaving the scene of a crime, and most of the Scourge's other assassinations were committed under similar disguises. His most famous appearance was in ''Captain America'' #319, in which he killed eighteen minor supervillains at "the Bar With No Name" (see below).

Years later, in the ''[[U.S. Agent]]'' miniseries, U.S. Agent and the [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]] fought the Scourges, including one who had claimed to be the U.S. Agent's brother. In the end, the Angel died (although he was survived by a brother who had also used the identity of the Angel), Domino died, and the remaining Scourges were defeated and arrested.

The Red Skull's minion [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] was at one time sent by the Skull to recruit the villains [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] II and [[Blackwing#Blackwing (Joseph Manfredi)|Blackwing]] for his pool of underlings, loosely titled '''The [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]]'''. She used her illusion-casting abilities to generate the image of the Scourge, who then "shot and killed" both villains, in reality, simply fooling [[Captain America]] so as to allow her to escape with the criminals.  The primary writer and conceiver of the Scourge plotline as well as the Captain America storyline, Mark Gruenwald, had often expressed some disappointment in what he saw as the short-sightedness in killing so many potentially "fun" villains rather than re-imagining or improving them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Scourge played a major role in the story ''The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'', despite the fact that the character never actually appears during the story outside of a dream sequence.  Throughout the events of the story, the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] is stricken with paranoia over the idea that the Scourge will come for him next.  During the climax of the arc, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] employs an unseen Scourge imposter to fake an attempt on the Shocker's life, preventing him from killing [[Spider-Man]] and causing him to flee the scene, all in order to avoid attention being drawn near a location that the Kingpin was having robbed. 

In the pages of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', a new Scourge appeared; this one assassinated the Thunderbolts members [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] and [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Techno]], as well as a pair of civilians (Gayle Rogers and Roberta Haggerty) who were investigating Jolt's death. It was revealed that this Scourge was actually Jack Monroe, alias Bucky and [[Nomad (comics)#Jack Monroe|Nomad]], who was being mentally controlled by the [[superhuman]]-hating government agent [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]; Gyrich himself was being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]. Monroe was defeated and freed from Gyrich's control by the Thunderbolts and their allies, the Redeemers. He then, apparently, abandoned the Scourge equipment and identity after the battle.  As Scourge, Monroe had access to a wide array of technology based on equipment confiscated from super-villains.  Some were installed in the costume he wore, while several others were miniaturized using [[Henry Pym#Powers and abilities|Pym particles]] and stored in one of the costume's [[gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlets]]; all were accessible by a voice-coded system.  Specific items used included versions of the [[Green Goblin]]'s [[Goblin glider|glider]], the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]]'s helmet-installed energy projector, and [[Stilt-Man]]'s telescoping legs, as well as various unspecified weaponry, including a metal [[quarterstaff]].  He could also access his gauntlet's Pym particles to alter the size of himself or others, though excessive use of this ability on the Thunderbolt [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] forced him to abandon much of his weapon stores when his supply of Pym particles was spent.

Three characters bearing the names of the Scourge's previous victims - [[Hellrazor#Caged Angels|Hellrazor]], Caprice, and [[Mind-Wave#Caged Angels|Mindwave]] (minus the hyphen) - appeared in ''Thunderbolts'' #116. Caprice and Mindwave appeared along with [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]] and [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]] as supervillains incarcerated in Thunderbolts Mountain in ''Thunderbolts'' #117 telepathically discussing a plot against the Thunderbolts. Caprice, Mindwave, Mirage, and Bluestreak were all killed in their cells by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in ''Thunderbolts'' #121.

After the [[Punisher]] tries to assassinate Osborn (failing due to the intervention of [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]), Osborn asks the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to hunt him down.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #1</ref> In ''[[Punisher]]'' #5, the Hood is granted the powers of the Dark Dimension by his master [[Dormammu]] to revive seventeen murdered criminals ([[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] I, [[Bird-Man]] II, [[Black Abbott (comics)|Black Abbot]], [[Blue Streak (comics)|Blue Streak]] I, [[Cheetah (Marvel Comics)|Cheetah]], [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]] I, [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]], [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] I, [[Hijacker (comics)|Hijacker]], [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], [[Letha]], [[Megatak]], [[Mind-Wave]], [[Miracle Man]], [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)|Mirage]], [[Lascivious (comics)|Titania]] I, and [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] I) to help him take down the Punisher; and if they fail, they will be returned to their previous states of death and rot.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> The Hood told these criminals that the Scourge of the Underworld was actually Frank Castle and by killing him they'd be avenging their previous deaths and prolonging their new lives.  When asked by Microchip if he thought any of them believed that crap about the Punisher being Scourge, the Hood replied "sure they did".<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #6</ref> Several of these villains (including Firebrand, the Wraith, Cyclone and Mirage) are killed again while confronting the Punisher, but ultimately Basilisk and Death Adder subdue the vigilante, and the terms of the Hood's agreement are apparently fulfilled.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

In ''Thunderbolts'' #133, an otherwise unidentified man is christened '''Scourge''' by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and assigned to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. His first mission is to eliminate [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133</ref> This character is later revealed to be [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] with a new identity.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136</ref>

The original Scourge is among the various people in Erebus when [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] travels to the Underworld.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

== Villains killed in the Bar With No Name ==
In ''[[Captain America]]'' #319, the Scourge was disguised as the bartender of "the [[Bar With No Name]]," a super-villain hang-out in rural [[Medina County, Ohio]]. A number of villains had gathered there that evening to organize a concerted effort to stop the Scourge, all at the urgings of villain "manager" Gary Gilbert, formerly a villain called [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]].

Security equipment that Gilbert borrowed from the gadget-villain called the [[Tinkerer]] was ineffective in detecting the Scourge, as no one thought to scan the bartender, and eighteen villains were killed, including Gilbert himself, in the second panel from the end of the issue. The villains had no chance against Scourge due to a "no weapons policy" in the "Bar With No Name."
