'''Lady Octopus''' (real name '''Carolyn Trainer''' and also known as '''[[Doctor Octopus]] II''') is a [[supervillain]]ess in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as a protégée to her predecessor of the name and primarily an enemy to [[Spider-Man]] and [[Scarlet Spider]] ([[Ben Reilly]]).

==Publication history==
Lady Octopus first appearance was in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406 (October 1995) and was created by [[J. M. DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]].

==Fictional character biography==
Carolyn Trainer is the daughter of Seward Trainer who was a student of [[Doctor Octopus]]. After Doctor Octopus was killed by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] during the [[Clone Saga]], Carolyn replaced the teacher she adored.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #18</ref>

She obtained a set of four tentacles identical to Octavius's and made use of a personal force-field that kept anything from hitting her. However, her tentacles could lash out from the shield at any time during its use. She took the "Doctor Octopus" name in honor of her beloved instructor and began a campaign to steal her father's research in merging reality and virtual reality.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #405</ref>

When she found her father was being protected by [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]], she became jealous of the father-son relationship between him and her father. She tried but failed to blackmail her way into gaining Trainer's data by stealing a serum that could cure a seriously ill [[Mary Jane Watson]], resulting in her being beaten heavily by Spider-Man and revealing she was working for the mysterious [[Doctor Octopus|Master Programmer]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #62–63</ref><ref>''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #229</ref>

Carolyn continued her efforts to merge reality and virtual reality, ending up in a technological gang war against Mr. Tso and his boss [[Alistair Smythe]] with the Scarlet Spider in the middle of it. She hired the Looter, Override and Aura, and the Pro to assist her in this, as well as Stunner (Octavius's lover), and eventually succeeded in defeating Smythe and gaining the technology she needed before the Scarlet Spider thwarted her.<ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #1–2</ref><ref>''Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1–2</ref><ref>''Scarlet Spider'' #1–2</ref><ref>''Spectacular Scarlet Spider'' #1–2</ref>

The Master Programmer was revealed to be a digitized copy of Doctor Octopus' mind and Carolyn's overall plan had been to allow Master Programmer to exist in the real world, effectively resurrecting the original Doctor Octopus. This thwarted, she attempted to claim her father's then-comatose body and was finally captured by the police.<ref>''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #232</ref>

Later, she was involved in the resurrection of Doctor Octopus. The cult group known as [[The Hand (comics)|The Hand]], working for [[Richard Fisk|the Rose]], dug up Octavius' corpse and brought him back from the dead, albeit with large mental gaps. Carolyn injected him with all the data of the Master Programmer and returned the tentacles to him. She joined him as an assistant and faded into the background.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #425–428</ref>

Lady Octopus made a small appearance in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' as Lady Octopus to distinguish her from her mentor. She was given a new suit of armor by [[Lucia von Bardas]] and [[Tinkerer]]. She and [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin V]] were sent to assassinate [[Captain America]], but were defeated. They regrouped to a dock where a small army of Tinkerer's clients where waiting (consisting of [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] IX, [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel II]], [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]], [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|King Cobra]], [[Mentallo]], [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Spider-Slayer|Spider-Slayer XIX]], [[Trapster]] and [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]).<ref>''Secret War'' #3</ref> Lady Octopus fought [[Spider-Man]] and Captain America when the [[Fantastic Four]] join the battle. Just then, Lucia von Bardas activated the devices in the villains' suits linking them together to a giant bomb.<ref>''Secret War'' #4</ref> After Daisy Johnson deactivated von Bardas, Lady Octopus and the other villains Lucia von Bardas manipulated were all hospitalized with severe injuries.<ref>''Secret War'' #5</ref>

Lady Octopus has been hired by Walter Declun (a former member of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]]) to assist [[Absorbing Man]], [[Hydro-Man]], [[Killer Shrike]], a [[Mandroid]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] II, and Rock to defend him from Black Panther and the Fantastic Four after they uncovered his plot to destabilize all of Wakanda on [[Doctor Doom]]'s behalf. Walter Declun also upgraded their technological equipment in order to perform the job.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #11</ref>

Lady Octopus was later seen shortly before the [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]] when she went on a rampage in New York only to be defeated by [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #63</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Octopusforcefield.png|145px|thumbnail|left|A demonstration of Lady Octopus's personal force-field.]]
Lady Octopus has no superhuman abilities. The harness she uses can act as an extension of her own body, and can lift far more than her human body, provided she braces herself appropriately with other tentacles. The reaction time of these "tentacles" is superhumanly fast. The tentacles also enable her to traverse very difficult terrain and cover ground at car-like speeds. The tentacles are also armed with lasers.

Through the tentacles, Lady Octopus seems able to interface with appropriately equipped computer systems and enter virtual-reality interfaces telepathically.

The force field the harness projected over her body was resistant to most traumatic concussive force and conventional weapons attack. The weak point of the force field is around the tentacles themselves, something Scarlet Spider took advantage of with his impact webbing.

Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus was highly learned in the science of robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering.

==Other versions==

===MC2===
A version of her in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate future]] series ''Spider-Girl'' returned to supervillainy years after Otto Octavius's death, initially reclaiming the 'Doctor Octopus' title. Intending to create mutate soldiers for the mob, Carolyn Trainer briefly turned [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] back into Man-Wolf, before beating [[Spider-Girl]] in a pitched battle. Later, she freed crime boss Canis from prison in the hope of uniting to take over the criminal underworld and oppose the [[Black Tarantula]]; it turned out she was in fact working for the Tarantula, setting Canis up for a fall. Spider-Girl battled her once again and finally took her down.{{issue|date=March 2013}}
