'''Lady Octopus''' ('''Carolyn Trainer''', formerly the second Doctor Octopus), is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]]ess in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Her first appearance was in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406 (October 1995).  She was created by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]].

==Fictional character biography==
During the [[Clone Saga]], [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] was killed by [[Kaine]] and was replaced not long after by Carolyn Trainer, daughter of [[Seward Trainer]] and adoring student of Octavius.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #18</ref>

She obtained a set of four tentacles identical to Octavius' and made use of a personal force-field that kept anything from hitting her.  (However, her tentacles could lash out from the shield at any time during its use.) She took the name '''Doctor Octopus''' in honor of her beloved instructor, the original Dr. Octopus and began a campaign to steal her father's research in merging reality and virtual reality.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #405</ref> 

When she found her father was being protected by the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]], she became jealous of the father-son relationship between him and her father. She tried but failed to blackmail her way into gaining Trainer's data by stealing a serum that could cure a seriously ill [[Mary Jane Watson]], resulting in her being beaten heavily by Spider-Man and revealing she was working for the mysterious '''Master Programmer'''.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #62-63</ref><ref>''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #229</ref>   

Carolyn continued her efforts to merge reality and virtual reality, ending up in a technological gang war against Mr Tso and his boss [[Alistair Smythe]] with the Scarlet Spider in the middle of it. She hired the Looter, Override and Aura, and the Pro to assist her in this, as well as Octavius' lover Stunner, and eventually succeeded in defeating Smythe and gaining the technology she needed before the Scarlet Spider thwarted her.<ref>''Web of Scarlet Spider'' #1-2</ref><ref>''Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1-2</ref><ref>''Scarlet Spider'' #1-2</ref><ref>''Spectaculer Scarlet Spider'' #1-2</ref>  

The Master Programmer was revealed to be a digitised copy of Octavius' mind, and Carolyn's overall plan had been to allow the Programmer to exist in the real world, effectively resurrecting the original Doctor Octopus. This thwarted, she attempted to claim her father's then-comatose body and was finally captured by the police.<ref>''Spectaculer Spider-Man'' #232</ref> 

Later, however, she was involved in the resurrection of Otto Octavius. The cult group known as [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]], working for [[Richard Fisk#Other Roses|the Rose]], dug up Octavius' corpse and brought him back from the dead, albeit with large mental gaps; Carolyn injected him with all the data of the Master Programmer and returned the tentacles to him. She joined him as an assistant and faded into the background.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #425-428</ref>

She made a small appearance in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' as '''Lady Octopus''' to distinguish her from her mentor. She was given a new suit of armor by [[Lucia von Bardas]] and [[Tinkerer]]. She and [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] V were sent to assassinate [[Captain America]], but were defeated. They regrouped to a dock where a small army of Tinkerer's clients (consisting of [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] IX, [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] II, [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]], [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], [[Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]], [[Mentallo]], [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Spider-Slayer]] XIX, [[Trapster]], and [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]).<ref>''Secret War'' #3</ref> Lady Octopus fought Spider-Man and Captain America when the [[Fantastic Four]] join the battle. Just then, Lucia von Bardas activated the devices in the villains' suits linking them together to a giant bomb.<ref>''Secret War'' #4</ref>. After Daisy Johnson deactivated Lucia von Bardas, Lady Octopus and the other villains Lucia von Bardas manipulated were all hospitalized with severe injuries<ref>''Secret War'' #5</ref>

Lady Octopus has been hired by [[Walter Declun]].<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 5) #11</ref> She was later seen shortly before [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], when she tried capture [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]]. Carolyn is briefly encountered by Mockingbird.<ref>''New Avengers'' #63</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Octopusforcefield.png|145px|thumbnail|left|A demonstration of Lady Octopus's personal force-field.]]
Lady Octopus has no superhuman abilities. The harness she uses can act as an extension of her own body, and can lift far more than her human body, provided she braces herself appropriately with other tentacles. The reaction time of the these "tentacles" is superhumanly fast. The tentacles also enable her to traverse very difficult terrain and cover ground at car-like speeds. The tentacles are also armed with lasers.

Through the tentacles, Lady Octopus seems able to interface with appropriately equipped computer systems and enter virtual-reality interfaces telepathically.

The force field the harness projected over her body was resistant to most traumatic concussive force and conventional weapons attack. The weak point of the force field is around the tentacles themselves, something Ben Reilly, as the Scarlet Spider, took advantage of with his impact webbing.

Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus was highly learned in the science of robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
A version of her in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate future]] series ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' returned to supervillainy years after Octavius' death, initially reclaiming the title of Doctor Octopus. Intending to create mutate soldiers for the mob, Carolyn Trainer briefly turned [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] back into Man-Wolf, before beating Spider-Girl in a pitched battle. Later, she freed crime boss Canis from prison in the hope of uniting to take over the criminal underworld and oppose the [[Black Tarantula]]; it turned out she was in fact working for the Tarantula, setting Canis up for a fall. Spider-Girl battled her once again and finally took her down.
===Video games===
* A female, 2099 version of Doctor Octopus (With elements of Lady Octopus) appears as a boss in the video game ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'',<ref>http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/spider-man-shattered-dimensions/achievements/ Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions Achievements</ref> voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. '''Dr. Serena Patel''' is the head scientist of Alchemax's Shadow Division which is dedicated to the creation of dangerous super-weapons and twisted experiments. Fearing that Spider-Man's war on Alchemax would lead to her, Patel creates a battle suit and models it after her idol Dr. Otto Octavius along with six high-tech mechanical arms, and gives herself the title of 2099's Dr. Octopus. Believing that Octavius killed the Heroic Age Spider-Man, she uses her knowledge of history to defeat the 2099 Spider-Man including creating [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin 2099]] and manipulating [[Alternate versions of Venom#Scorpion 2099|Scorpion 2099]]. When she finds a fragment of the Tablet of Chaos and Order, she goes mad with power and builds a Condensed Matter Reactor powered by the fragment to wreak havoc and take over the world. When Spider-Man 2099 finds Doctor Octopus, he is attacked by her and escapes upon setting off the self-destruct sequence. Spider-Man 2099 escapes the explosion and finds her at the Condensed Matter Reactor. Doctor Octopus ends up unleashing some strange creatures wielding a copy of her tentacle on Spider-Man 2099 as he moves about to shut down the 4 reactor cores. After shutting down the reactor cores, Spider-Man 2099 confronts Doctor Octopus in the reactor. Doctor Octopus is defeated by Spider-Man by knocking her out and claims the tablet fragment.
