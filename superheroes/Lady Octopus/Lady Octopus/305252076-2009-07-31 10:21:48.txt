'''Lady Octopus''' ('''Carolyn Trainer''', formerly the second Doctor Octopus), is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]]ess in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Her first appearance was in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406 (October 1995).  She was created by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]].

==Fictional character biography==
During the [[Clone Saga]], [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] was killed by [[Kaine]] and was replaced not long after by Carolyn Trainer, daughter of [[Seward Trainer]] and adoring student of Octavius.

She obtained a set of four tentacles identical to Octavius' and made use of a personal force-field that kept anything from hitting her.  (However, her tentacles could lash out from the shield at any time during its use.) She took the name '''Doctor Octopus''' in honor of her beloved instructor, the original Dr. Octopus and began a campaign to steal her father's research in merging reality and virtual reality.

When she found her father was being protected by the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]], she became jealous of the father-son relationship between him and her father. She tried but failed to blackmail her way into gaining Trainer's data by stealing a serum that could cure a seriously ill [[Mary Jane Watson]], resulting in her being beaten heavily by Spider-Man and revealing she was working for the mysterious '''Master Programmer'''. 

Carolyn continued her efforts to merge reality and virtual reality, ending up in a technological gang war against Mr Tso and his boss [[Alistair Smythe]] with the Scarlet Spider in the middle of it. She hired the Looter, Override and Aura, and the Pro to assist her in this, as well as Octavius' lover Stunner, and eventually succeeded in defeating Smythe and gaining the technology she needed before the Scarlet Spider thwarted her.

The Master Programmer was revealed to be a digitised copy of Octavius' mind, and Carolyn's overall plan had been to allow the Programmer to exist in the real world, effectively resurrecting the original Doctor Octopus. This thwarted, she attempted to claim her father's then-comatose body and was finally captured by the police. 

Later, however, she was involved in the resurrection of Otto Octavius. The cult group known as [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]], working for [[Richard Fisk#Other Roses|the Rose]], dug up Octavius' corpse and brought him back from the dead, albeit with large mental gaps; Carolyn injected him with all the data of the Master Programmer and returned the tentacles to him. She joined him as an assistant and faded into the background.

She made a small appearance in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' as '''Lady Octopus''' to distinguish her from her mentor.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Octopusforcefield.png|145px|thumbnail|left|A demonstration of Lady Octopus's personal force-field.]]
Lady Octopus has no superhuman abilities. The harness she uses can act as an extension of her own body, and can lift far more than her human body, provided she braces herself appropriately with other tentacles. The reaction time of the these "tentacles" is superhumanly fast. The tentacles also enable her to traverse very difficult terrain and cover ground at car-like speeds. The tentacles are also armed with lasers.

Through the tentacles, Lady Octopus seems able to interface with appropriately equipped computer systems and enter virtual-reality interfaces telepathically.

The force field the harness projected over her body was resistant to most traumatic concussive force and conventional weapons attack. The weak point of the force field is around the tentacles themselves, something Ben Reilly, as the Scarlet Spider, took advantage of with his impact webbing.

Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus was highly learned in the science of robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
A version of her in the [[MC2]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate future]] series ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' returned to supervillainy years after Octavius' death, initially reclaiming the title of Doctor Octopus. Intending to create mutate soldiers for the mob, Carolyn Trainer briefly turned [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] back into Man-Wolf, before beating Spider-Girl in a pitched battle. Later, she freed crime boss Canis from prison in the hope of uniting to take over the criminal underworld and oppose the [[Black Tarantula]]; it turned out she was in fact working for the Tarantula, setting Canis up for a fall. Spider-Girl battled her once again and finally took her down.
