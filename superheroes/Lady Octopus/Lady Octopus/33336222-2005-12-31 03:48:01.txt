'''Lady Octopus''' (Carolyn Trainer, formerly the second Doctor Octopus), is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]]ess in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Her first appearance was in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #406 (October 1995).  She was created by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Angel Medina]].

==Character Biography==
During the [[Clone Saga]], [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] was killed by [[Kaine]] and was replaced not long after by Carolyn Trainer, daughter of [[Seward Trainer]] and adoring student of Octavius.  She obtained a set of four tentacles identical to Octavius' and made use of a personal force-field that kept anything from hitting her.  (However, her tentacles could lash out from the shield at any time during its use.) She took the name '''Doctor Octopus''' in honor of her beloved instructor, the original Dr. Octopus.  

When she found her father was being protected by the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]], she became jealous of the father-son relationship between him and her father. Her attempts to claime her father's then-comatose body resulted in her defeat and capture by the police. Later, however, she was involved in the resurrection of Otto Octavius. After Octvaius was brought back to life by the cult group known as [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]], Trainer returned the tentacles to him. She joined him as an assistant and faded into the background.

A version of her in the [[MC2]] [[parallel universe|alternate future]] series ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' recently troubled the title character, while the mainstream version made a small appearance in ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'', both as '''Lady Octopus''' to distinguish her from her mentor.

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Octopus has no superhuman abilities. The harness she uses can act as an extension of her own body, and can lift far more than her human body, provided she braces herself appropriately with other tentacles. The reaction time of the these "tentacles" is superhumanly fast. The tentacles also enable her to traverse very difficult terrain and cover ground at car-like speeds. The force field the harness projected over her body was resistant to most traumatic concussive force and conventional weapons attack.

Aside from her harness, Lady Octopus was highly learned in the science of robotics, information technology, applied physics, and mechanical engineering.
