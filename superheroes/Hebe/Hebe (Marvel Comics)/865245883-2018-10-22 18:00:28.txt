She first appeared in ''Ka-Zar'' #1 (August 1970), written by [[Allyn Brodsky]] and [[Frank Springer]], and is based on the [[Hebe (mythology)|mythological character of the same name]].

==Publication history==
Hebe first appeared in ''Ka-Zar'' #1, and appeared very sparsely over the subsequent four decades.  She made a notable appearance in ''Incredible Hulk: Hercules Unleashed'' (October 1996).  She then appeared in ''Hulk vs. Hercules: When Titans Collide'' #1 (June 2008), and became a recurring character in the second year of ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' beginning in issue #127.

==Fictional character biography==
The third child of Zeus and Hera (her brothers are [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]), she is the Goddess of Youth and the cup-bearer of the gods, responsible for brewing [[ambrosia]]. She was married to the newly-divine Hercules as a peace offering between Hercules and her mother Hera, and for a time the two of them had a happy relationship. However, Hercules grew dissatisfied with life on Olympus, and returned to the mortal world  in search of adventure. He also began having affairs, which left Hebe distraught as Hera told her that the failure of her marriage was her fault.<ref name="assault">''Assault on New Olympus Prologue'' #1</ref>

Following the destruction of Olympus at the hands of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], Hebe serves her mother Hera as a secretary at the Olympus Group.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #123''</ref>  She later arranges for [[Norman Osborn]] and his [[Dark Avengers]] to arrive on the site of a battle between Hera and Hercules' group, believing that her ultimate duty was still to him.  When Hera discovered her betrayal, she blasted Hebe with her thunderbolt, sending her hurtling out of the Olympus Group tower to the ground. Relatively unharmed, she fled the scene in search of Hercules, but could not find him.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #128-129</ref>

She is later discovered by [[Aunt May]] living with a group of homeless people in [[Central Park]], and is convinced to take her followers to a shelter at which May works. May quickly befriends Hebe, whose ambrosia mixture makes the shelter a huge success. May sets her up on a blind date with her nephew [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], which is interrupted by an angry Hercules.  Hebe tearfully confronts him his abandoning her, and Hercules admits that it was never her that drove him away, but his desire for adventure, as he cannot be happy as a god away from the world. Hebe says that she loves him for that, and the two depart on better terms, with Spider-Man, to confront Hera's evil scheme.<ref name="assault" /> Hebe's joy of reunion with her former husband was quickly dashed away when Hercules apparently sacrificed himself to save Earth.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #141</ref>

When [[Amadeus Cho]] takes over the Olympus Group she becomes his assistant, and is ecstatic to learn that Hercules is not in the Underworld. [[Agamemnon (comics)|Vali Halfling]] reveals that Hebe's ambrosia is one of the four elements needed to ascend to the power-level of the Skyfathers.<ref>''Heroic Age: Prince of Power'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Hebe is one of the few deities to survive Amatsu-Mikaboshi's destruction of the Council of God-Heads. She and Hercules reunite in Hawaii, and despite her protests for Hercules not to agree for [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]] and Pele to re-make him as a true All-Father, Hercules consents and ascends to the full power and prestige of Skyfather.<ref>''Chaos War'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
An Olympian goddess, Hebe is immortal (and eternally young), with enhanced durability.
