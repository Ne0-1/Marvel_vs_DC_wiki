==Publication history==

The character first appeared in ''Ka-Zar'' #1, and very sparsely over the subsequent four decades.  She made a notable appearance in ''Incredible Hulk: Hercules Unleashed'' (October 1996).  She then appeared in ''Hulk vs. Hercules: When Titans Collide'' #1 (June 2008), and became a recurring character in the second year of ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'', starting with issue #127.

==Fictional character biography==
The third child of Zeus and Hera (her brothers are [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]), she is the Goddess of Youth and the cup-bearer of the gods, responsible for brewing ambrosia.  She was married to the newly-divine Hercules as a peace-offering between Hercules and her mother Hera, and for a time the two of them had a happy relationship.  However, Hercules grew dissatisfied with life on Olympus, and returned to the mortal world in the late 20th century in search of adventure.  He also began having affairs, which left Hebe distraught, as Hera told her that the failure of her marriage was her fault.<ref>''Assault on New Olympus Prologue'' #1</ref>

In the modern era, following the destruction of Olympus at the hands of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], Hebe served her mother Hera as a secretary at the Olympus Group.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #123''</ref>  She later arranges for [[Norman Osborn]] and his Dark Avengers to arrive on the site of a battle between Hera and Hercules' group, believing that her ultimate duty was still to him.  When Hera discovered her betrayal, she blasted Hebe with her thunderbolt, sending her hurtling out of the Olympus Group tower to the ground.  Relatively unharmed, she fled the scene in search of Hercules, but could not find him.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #128-129</ref>

She is later discovered by [[Aunt May]] living with a group of homeless people in [[Central Park]], and is convinced to take her followers to a shelter that May works at.  May quickly befriends Hebe, whose ambrosia mixture makes the shelter a huge success.  May sets her up on a blind date with her nephew [[Peter Parker]], which is interrupted by an angry Hercules.  Hebe tearfully confronts him about why he abandoned her, and Hercules admits that it was never her that drove him away, rather, his desire for adventure, as he cannot be happy as a god away from the world.  Hebe says that she loves him for that, and the two depart on better terms to confront Hera's evil scheme.<ref>''Assault on New Olympus Prologue'' #1</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
An Olympian goddess, Hebe is immortal (and eternally) young, with enhanced durability.
