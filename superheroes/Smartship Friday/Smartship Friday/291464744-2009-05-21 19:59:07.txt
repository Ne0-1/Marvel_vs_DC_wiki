'''Smartship Friday''' is a fictional starship in the [[Marvel Universe]].  It first appeared in ''Power Pack'' #1 (Aug 1984) and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[June Brigman]].

The [[Kymellian]] [[Aelfyre Whitemane]] owned this “smartship”, which named itself Friday after the character from [[Robinson Crusoe]].  A smartship is a starship which is controlled by a computer system so advanced that it is effectively sentient, with a human-like personality.

After Whitemane was fatally wounded and had transferred his superhuman abilities into the four children who would become [[Power Pack]]<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 1) #1</ref>, Friday devoted itself to their service, adopting the role of mentor to the fledgling superheroes.  Power Pack often argued over the use of gender-specific pronouns for Friday (possibly prompted by Friday's constant statements of maternal love towards the children), speculating that though an artificial intelligence (and thus sexless) he/she may or may not have been female, but no decision was reached amongst themselves or by Friday one way or another - although in the [[Marvel Adventures]] line of comics (a separate continuity), Friday's voice was revealed to be identical to that of film actress [[Rosalind Russell]]<ref>''Power Pack: Day One'' #2</ref>.

Friday was also used by the [[New Warriors]] during the period when [[Alex Power]] was a member of the team, but was destroyed in that series' final issue<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 1) #75</ref>.  The artificial intelligence was later restored to another - more advanced - starship<ref>''Power Pack'' (vol. 2) #3</ref>, but in the wake of several alien invasions that pointedly destroyed orbital Earth defences, ships and installations over the next 10 years of Marvel continuity, Friday's status remains unknown, having not been seen since the Power Pack 2000 miniseries 'Peer Pressure'.

==Other versions==

===Marvel Adventures===

Friday was and remains a regular cast member of the Marvel Adventures line of successful Power Pack children's digest collections, which feature the most recognisable (and lucrative) versions of the characters from their long and varied publication history.  Because of the team's youthful status in these books, Friday's role is often that of a baffled, but well-meaning mentor, and its physical appearance is identical to its original body before it was destroyed in New Warriors #75.
