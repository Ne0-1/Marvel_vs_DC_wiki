'''Smartship Friday''' is a fictional starship in the [[Marvel Universe]].  It first appeared in ''Power Pack'' #1 (Aug 1984) and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[June Brigman]].

The [[Kymellian]] [[Aelfyre Whitemane]] owned this “smartship”, which named itself Friday after the character from [[Robinson Crusoe]].  A smartship is a starship which is controlled by a computer system so advanced that it is effectively sentient, with a human-like personality.

After Whitemane was fatally wounded and had transferred his superhuman abilities into the four children who would become [[Power Pack]], Friday devoted itself to their service.

Friday was also used by the [[New Warriors]] during the period when [[Alex Power]] was a member of the team.
