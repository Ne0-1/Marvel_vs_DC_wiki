==Fictional character biography==
In the beginning of times, alien sorcerer [[X'Hoss]] foretells the creation of the Designate, who will help evolve sentient beings to the next level of existence. Billions of years later, '''Tarene''' is born. She is told about the fate of the evil [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and together with others seeks a way to stop him. In the meantime, [[Thanos]] obtains X'Hoss' knowledge and destroys Tarene's home-world. She gains the help of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Orikal]] in defeating the villain.

Tarene later transforms herself into an Asgardian goddess and becomes Thor's loyal ally, taking the name "Thor Girl." She tries to aid Thor in his adventures, but in the battle against a revived [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] sacrifices nearly all of her cosmic powers to contribute the additional power needed to defeat him. Upon Odin's apparent death, Thor Girl loses all of her cosmic powers. She retains the powers she had as Thor Girl. She returns to Earth in an attempt to live a normal life, but is also seen adventuring every now and then.

She knows that she is destined to, and one day will, regain her full power and then some, to become The Designate.
