===Civil War/The Initiative===
Thor Girl is one of the heroes who registered with the Superhuman Registration Act that was forged during the 2006-2007 "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" storyline. After the Superhuman Registration Act is passed, Thor Girl interferes in a jewel theft undertaken by the [[Grey Gargoyle]], a previous foe of hers, and pummels the villain, preventing the jewel heist in the process. In return, the Grey Gargoyle undertakes a law suit with the assistance of Mallory Book at the Superhuman Law Offices of [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Thor Girl is one of the first recruits for the [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] training facility. Other fellow trainees include [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], [[Rage (comics)|Rage]], and [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref>

The Initiative recruits are sent as crowd control in Manhattan with Thor Girl aiding mass evacuation when the city is attacked by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who is seeking revenge upon the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]]. However, Rage breaks ranks to try and help the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in battle against the Hulk and his [[Warbound]], and Thor Girl is among the trainees who sides with Rage. Easily defeated, Thor Girl and the others are imprisoned at Manhattan Square Gardens and controlled by obedience disks. The Initiative's black ops team, including the empathic metamorph Trauma, are sent in to free Thor Girl and her compatriots, with Trauma assuming the form and powers of Thor as he battles the Warbound, leaving Thor Girl awestruck by the encounter.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref>

Subsequent to Trauma's assumption of Thor's form, Thor Girl has expressed a kind of hero worship of and becomes enamored with Trauma.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} However, both Tarene and Trauma are brutally attacked by the [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] clone, calling himself KIA (Killed In Action). Tarene is badly burned while protecting Trauma, who is then stabbed in the chest by KIA.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #9</ref>

Thor Girl recovers fairly quickly. At first, she assists in a mass super-human effort dedicated to rebuilding New York.<ref>''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control'' #1-3 (March 2008)</ref> Later, she is assigned together with [[Ultra Girl]] to the Cavalry, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s local superhero team, once her Initiative training is complete.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

==="Secret Invasion"===
During the events of the 2008 "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, the [[Skrull]] [[Dum Dum Dugan]] calls all the sleeper agents in the Initiative, causing Ultragirl and Thor Girl to fight each other out of fear. When the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] arrives to the scene, [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] confirms that Thor Girl is a Skrull, killing her with her own hammer with the help of [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref> It is unclear at this point how long the Skrull agent had been impersonating Thor Girl.

After the invasion is over, the real Thor Girl is shown in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> She attends a therapy session with Trauma, when Camp Hammond is attacked by the Thor clone [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]]. The clone beats Thor Girl badly, until [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] intervenes.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref>

==="Fear Itself"===
During the 2011 "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Thor Girl joins Steve Rogers' New Initiative, under [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy's]] leadership. She is quite confused about why Odin took all of the Asgardians back to the Asgard Realm, and is still deciding as to whether she should join them. While saving some people in the city, she is attacked because she has a hammer similar to those which had been appearing all around the earth, and accidentally kills a police officer who shot at her by deflecting the bullets back into him.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> At Prodigy's request she turns herself in and is kept in a holding cell, but when she is accosted by men outside the cell, who attempt to interrogate her as to the nature of the Worthy, [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] arrives to rescue her and subdues the men.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As her powers are based upon the Asgardians, Thor Girl possesses the conventional physical attributes of the Asgardian gods. She is immune to all Earthly diseases and is highly durable, able to withstand attacks which would destroy an ordinary human. She also will heal at incredible speeds due to her godly life force. Thor Girl also possesses superhuman strength which rivals the most powerful of the gods and her now Asgardian-level metabolism provides her with far greater than human endurance in all physical activities. Additionally, like most Asgardians, she is near-ageless with a lifetime which may stretch into several millennia.

As Thor Girl, Tarene wields a gold hammer through which she could channel her powers as a continuous beam of energy capable of knocking Thor off his feet and shattering buildings. Like Thor, she can also use her hammer to fly and control the weather, allowing her to summon storms, gusts of wind, create lightning bolts and various other effects. She can also traverse dimensional barriers such as from Earth to Asgard.

When she had her cosmic powers, the full extent of what she could do was unknown, but it was stated her powers were on a level that closely rivaled Odin's.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

==Other versions==
In one alternate future world, Thor Girl tried to reach back in time to empower the alien [[Desak]] trying to locate a missing Thor.<ref>''Thor Annual 2001''</ref><ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #48, 50</ref>
