'''Thor Girl''' is a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. 

==Character biography==
In the beginning of times, alien sorcerer [[X'Hoss]] foretells the creation of the Designate, who will help evolve sentient beings to the next level of existence. Billions of years later, '''Tarene''' is born. She is told about the fate of the evil [[Destroyer (comics)|Destroyer]] and together with others seeks a way to stop him. In the meantime, [[Thanos (comics)|Thanos]] obtains X'Hoss' knowledge and destroys Tarene's homeworld. She gains the help of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in defeating the villain.

Tarene later transforms herself into an Asgardian goddess and becomes Thor's loyal ally, taking the name "Thor Girl."  She tries to aid Thor in his adventures, but in the battle against a revived [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]] sacrifices nearly all of her cosmic powers to contribute the addtional power needed to defeat him.  Upon Odin's apparent death, Thor Girl loses all of her cosmic powers. She retains the powers she had as Thor Girl. She returns to Earth in an attempt to live a normal life, but is also seen adventuring every now and then.

Thor Girl is one of the heroes who registered with the Super-hero Registration Act which was forged during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event.

==Powers==
Thor Girl possesses superhuman strength and invulnerablity due to her Asgardian powers, as well as near immortality. Her hammer appears to have weather control powers and is able to discharge energy blasts.  When her tears are placed in her sacred chalice while she holds a magical stone, anyone not touching the stone is destroyed by a searing wave of eldritch energy.

When she had her cosmic powers the full extent of what she could do was unknown, but it was stated her powers were on a level to rival Odin's.

==Alternate versions==
In one alternate future world, Thor Girl tried to reach back in time to empower the alien Desak trying to locate a missing Thor.
