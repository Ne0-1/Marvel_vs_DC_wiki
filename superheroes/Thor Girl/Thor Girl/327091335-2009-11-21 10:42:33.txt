'''Thor Girl''' ('''Tarene''') is a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by writer [[Dan Jurgens]] and artist [[John Romita, Jr.]], she first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #22 (August 2000). 

==Fictional character biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
In the beginning of time, alien sorcerer [[X'Hoss]] foretells the creation of the Designate, who will help evolve sentient beings to the next level of existence. Billions of years later, '''Tarene''' is born. She is told about the fate of the evil [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] and together with others seeks a way to stop him. In the meantime, [[Thanos]] obtains X'Hoss' knowledge and destroys Tarene's home-world. She gains the help of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Orikal]] in defeating the villain.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Tarene later transforms herself into an Asgardian goddess and becomes Thor's loyal ally, taking the name "Thor Girl" and the civilian identity of Jake Olson's 'cousin' Tara{{Issue|date=November 2009}}.  She tries to assist Thor in his adventures, aiding him in his confrontations with [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]]{{Issue|date=November 2009}}, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and Nullitor,  but in a later battle against a revived [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] she sacrifices nearly all of her cosmic powers to contribute the additional power needed to defeat him{{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. Upon Odin's apparent death, Thor Girl loses most of her cosmic powers{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. She retains the powers she had as Thor Girl. She returns to Earth in an attempt to live a normal life as Tara Olson, but is also seen adventuring occasionally{{Issue|date=November 2009}}.

She knows that she is destined to, and one day will, regain her full power and then some, to become The Designate.

===Civil War/The Initiative===

Thor Girl is one of the heroes who registered with the Superhuman Registration Act which was forged during the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

After the Superhuman Registration Act is passed, Thor Girl interferes in a jewel theft undertaken by the [[Grey Gargoyle]], a previous foe of hers, and pummels the villain, preventing the jewel heist in the process. In return the Grey Gargoyle undertakes a law suit with the assistance of Mallory Book at the Superhuman Law Offices of [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg and Holliway]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Thor Girl is one of the first recruits for the [[Camp Hammond]] training facility. Other fellow trainees include [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] and [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

The Initiative recruits are sent as crowd control in Manhattan with Thor Girl aiding mass evacuation when the city is attacked by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who is seeking revenge upon the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]]. However, Rage breaks ranks to try and help the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in battle against the Hulk and his [[Warbound]], and Thor Girl is among the trainees who sides with Rage. Easily defeated, Thor Girl and the others are imprisoned at Manhattan Square Gardens and controlled by obedience disks. The Initiative's black ops team, including the empathic metamorph Trauma, are sent in to free Thor Girl and her compatriots, with Trauma assuming the form and powers of Thor as he battles the Warbound, leaving Thor Girl awestruck by the encounter.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} 

Subsequent to Trauma's assumption of Thor's form{{Issue|date=November 2009}}, Thor Girl has expressed a kind of hero worship of and becomes enamoured with Trauma{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. However both Tarene and Trauma are brutally attacked by the [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] clone calling himself KIA (Killed In Action). Tarene is badly burned while protecting Trauma, who is then stabbed in the chest by KIA.<ref>Avengers the Initiative #9</ref>

Thor Girl recovers fairly quickly. At first, she assists in a mass super-human effort dedicated to rebuilding New York <ref>"World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control" #1 -3 (March 2008)</ref>. Later, she is assigned together with [[Ultra Girl]] to the Cavalry, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s local superhero team, once her Initiative training is complete.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During the events of [[Secret Invasion]], the [[Skrull]] [[Dum Dum Dugan]] calls all the sleeper agents in the Initiative, causing Ultragirl and Thor Girl to fight each other out of fear. When the [[Skrull Kill Krew]] arrives to the scene, [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] confirms that Thor Girl is a Skrull, killing her with her own hammer with the help of [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]].<ref>''Avengers The Initiative'' #18</ref>

It is unclear at this point how long the Skrull agent had been impersonating Thor Girl.

After the invasion is over, the real Thor Girl is shown in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> She attends a therapy session with Trauma, when Camp Hammond is attacked by the Thor clone. The clone beats Thor Girl badly, until Gauntet intervenes.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

As her powers are based upon the Asgardians, Thor Girl possesses the conventional physical attributes of the Asgardian gods.  She is immune to all Earthly diseases and is highly durable, able to withstand attacks which would destroy an ordinary human. She also will heal at incredible speeds due to her godly life force.  Thor Girl also possesses superhuman strength which rivals the most powerful of the gods and her now Asgardian-level metabolism provides her with far greater than human endurance in all physical activities. Additionally, like most Asgardians, she is near-ageless with a lifetime which may stretch into several millennia. 

As Thor Girl, Tarene wields a gold hammer through which she could channel her powers as a continuous beam of energy capable of knocking Thor off his feet and shattering buildings. Like Thor, she can also use her hammer to fly and control the weather, allowing her to summon storms, gusts of wind, create lightning bolts and various other effects. She can also traverse dimensional barriers such as from Earth to Asgard.

When she had her cosmic powers the full extent of what she could do was unknown, but it was stated her powers were on a level that closely rivaled Odin's.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}
