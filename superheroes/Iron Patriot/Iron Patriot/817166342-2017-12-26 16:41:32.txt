'''Iron Patriot''' is a fictional [[powered exoskeleton]] combat suit used by several characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The [[Aliases|alias]] is an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgam]] of [[Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man's armors|armor]] and [[Captain America]]'s [[American patriotism|patriotism]].

==Fictional history==
===Norman Osborn===
{{Main article|Norman Osborn}}
[[Norman Osborn]] donned the original Iron Patriot armor during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline to exert his authority as 'commander' of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and his own [[Dark Avengers|personal Avengers]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> Osborn's Iron Patriot's activities have been increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes such as when he was tricked into attacking [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (in an early Iron Man suit) and when the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] led by the new [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] (Bucky Barnes) used Iron Patriot's tracking device on [[Luke Cage]] as a trick to destroy his own house.<ref>''New Avengers'' #60</ref> During his [[Siege (comics)|invasion]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] on the "claim" of a [[national security]] threat, Osborn's Iron Patriot armor gets dismantled remotely by Stark in the middle of Osborn's fight with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], revealing Osborn's [[Green Goblin]]-like facepaint in fear of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Void]].<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]]. ''Siege'' #1â€“4</ref> When Rogers, Stark and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] transfer him to the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] penitentiary, Osborn blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

===Iron Patriot drones===
Later storylines show replicas of the Iron Patriot armor. During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, one is seen amongst Iron Man's many armors summoned to assists the New Avengers against the new [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Red Skull]] (in her Skadi form), and is vaporized with the other armors by the female villain's new powers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #17</ref>

During the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, another is seen at a weapons expo that [[Daisy Johnson]] and [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] were attending. During the attack by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (Advanced Idea Mechanics) and their fight with the [[Secret Avengers]] (which [[Rebel Ralston]] gets killed), the [[Andrew Forson|Scientist Supreme]] of the A.I.M. High Council takes the opportunity to steal the armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> The Iron Patriot armor was replicated and its low-level A.I. was grown considerably, creating an army of sentient Iron Patriot drones which A.I.M. used to incriminate the [[United States]] in numerous international attacks. When an army of Iron Patriot droids that were going to attack [[Iran]] appear, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sent the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to destroy the Iron Patriot droid army.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

[[War Machine|James Rhodes]] wears yet another back-up armor per S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]]'s suggestion. Using holographic communication, S.H.I.E.L.D. hacks into the A.I.M. network which allows Rhodes to talk to the Iron Patriot suits. Rhodes makes the Iron Patriot army understand their programmed actions are wrong, and states Rhodes could teach them. In response, the Iron Patriot androids send Rhodes a new version of Iron Patriot armor for a while.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

Later on, however, the Iron Pariot drones were disabled and badly damaged when the Secret Avengers were confronted by a vengeful Inhuman called the Junkman (who possess the power of technopathy).

'''Dr. Toni Ho''' is [[Ho Yinsen]]'s daughter who is an engineer with three doctorates.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #1</ref> Toni Ho first appeared in ''New Avengers'' Vol. 4 #1 (December 2015), and created by [[Al Ewing]] (writer) and [[Gerardo Sandoval]] (artist).

She becomes a member of the rehabilitated [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (Avengers Idea Mechanics) after being bought out by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. As part of the group, she serves as part of a support team for the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #9</ref> Toni also studied Aikku Jokinen, the wearer of the sentient [[Pod (comics)|Pod]] suit. Toni took an interest in Aikku, not only due to Pod's suit but because she sympathizes with Aikku's personal reasons for not wanting to take Pod off. As Toni has fallen in love with Aikku, and Aikku reciprocated these feelings. Both were attacked by the [[Mister Fantastic|Maker]] and Toni donned her own Iron Man armor to defend Aikku and Pod. When Pod ejected Aikku to save her, Toni helps her love interest with the new undersuit.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4  #13-15</ref>

Toni later uses her own Iron Patriot armor as a member of the [[U.S.Avengers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/newscomic-riffs/wp/2016/07/01/marvel-is-creating-an-american-themed-avengers-led-by-a-british-writer-and-a-brazilian-mutant/title=Page Not Found - The Washington Post|date=30 April 2012|publisher=}}</ref> In their first mission, the team encountered the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] in their floating volcanic island base. They're later approached by a future version of [[Danielle Cage]] as Captain America when her nemesis, the Golden Skull, arrived in their timeline to steal all the wealth in the world. In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crashes a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEOs were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull, who was wearing a golden armored suit. Danielle then goes back to her timeline with the Golden Skull as her prisoner.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #1-3</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Aikku becomes concerned about Toni, since she's been spending too much time upgrading her armor.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #5</ref> During the event, the team arrives in [[Washington D.C.]] to confront Hydra when [[Robert Maverick|Red Hulk]] begins to attack them due to nanites that were injected in him, which start to control him. In an attempt to save them, Toni used a teleportation device to send Enigma and Squirrel Girl away, where they ended up in Paris. She and Red Hulk are then captured and imprisoned, when they see a nearly dead Roberto in one of the cells. While adjusting to prison life, Toni manages to save Roberto just in time when Hydra soldiers arrive at their cell. At the prison, Toni helps Roberto in the careful use of his powers to defeat the guards and free Red Hulk from the nanites controlling him, enabling them to take control of the prison. She then makes contact with Enigma, after she and Squirrel Girl help the Champions of Europe to defeat Hydra soldiers in Paris, and makes plans to have them return to the US. She also tells Enigma that she'll quit the Iron Patriot mantle so that their relationship can continue. During the course of this imprisonment, Toni lets go of some of her anger against Tony Stark, realizing that her father's sacrifice was a heroic act and should be honored. In the aftermath of the event, Toni deactivates the nanites inside Red Hulk, enabling him to return to normal. She's later approached by some A.I.M. agents who want her to become the organization's new leader after Roberto quits.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #6-10</ref> 

While travelling through space, Smasher and the U.S.Avengers are attacked by space pirates known as warpjackers. After a brief fight, the pirates tell them that Glenbrook is actually a planet named Kral X and that it's ruler, Ritchie Redwood, is ruthless. Arriving in Kral X, the heroes manage to help Cannonball and the planet's rebels in overthrowing Ritchie. After restoring order to the planet, the heroes head home.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #11-12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Iron Patriot armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in the helmet which allowed the suit to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armors utilized repulsor technology, the original Iron Patriot design did not as "[[Norman Osborn|Oz]] [was] too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system so the chest's star-shaped Uni Beam projector had a less powerful output.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List â€“ Spider-Man'' #1</ref> However, the new Iron Patriot armor is a complete redesign that's an update of the previous model.

To help his [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|fiancÃ©]], Harry gains access to the American Son armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #597.

After he is defeated, Gabriel is placed in a psychiatric hospital and the American Son armor is thought to be destroyed.
