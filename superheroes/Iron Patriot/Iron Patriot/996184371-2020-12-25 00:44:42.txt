==Fictional history==

Norman Osborn donned the original Iron Patriot armor during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline to exert his authority as "commander" of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and the [[Dark Avengers]] in spite of the original [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name="Dark Avengers #1">''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> However, Osborn's activities as Iron Patriot have been increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes such as when he was tricked into attacking [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and when the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] led by [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] used the Iron Patriot armor's tracking device on [[Luke Cage]] as a trick to destroy his own house.<ref>''New Avengers'' #60</ref> During Osborn's [[Siege (comics)|invasion]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] on the grounds of a national security threat, the Iron Patriot armor is disabled during Osborn's fight with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], revealing Osborn's [[Green Goblin]]-like face paint in fear of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Void]].<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]]. ''Siege'' #1–4</ref> When Rogers, Stark and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] transfer him to the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]] penitentiary, Osborn blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect America as Iron Patriot.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

===James Rhodes===
{{Main|War Machine}}
James Rhodes temporarily wore the Iron Patriot armor in ''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 and the ''Iron Patriot'' series.<ref name="Secret Avengers 6">''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref><ref>''Iron Patriot'' #1-5</ref>

===Iron Patriot Drones===
An Iron Patriot drone is seen during the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline summoned to assists the New Avengers, but is vaporized by the new [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Red Skull]]'s powers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #17</ref> 

A Iron Patriot drone is seen during the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event at a weapons expo that [[Daisy Johnson]] and [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] were attending. During an attack carried out by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and their subsequent fight with the [[Secret Avengers]], the [[Scientist Supreme]] takes the opportunity to steal the Iron Patriot armor to replicate.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> As a result, its low-level A.I. grew considerably as an army of sentient Iron Patriot drones, which A.I.M. used to incriminate the United States in numerous international attacks. The Iron Patriot drones were sent to attack [[Iran]], to which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sent the [[Hulk]] to destroy them in response.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #4</ref> Using holographic communication, S.H.I.E.L.D. hacks into the A.I.M. network so the Iron Patriot drones can understand their programmed actions are wrong.<ref name="Secret Avengers 6">''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

The Iron Patriot drones are next seen during the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline when the Junkman's technopathic [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] powers disable them during the former's fight with the Secret Avengers.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Sharon Carter===
{{Main|Sharon Carter}}
Sharon Carter briefly wore her own Iron Patriot armor to combat [[Selene (comics)|Selene]].<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 9 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Iron Patriot armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in the helmet which allowed the suit to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. The original Iron Patriot design lacked repulsor technology as "[[Norman Osborn|Oz]] [was] too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system so the star-shaped Uni Beam projector had a less powerful output.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List – Spider-Man'' #1</ref> However, the new Iron Patriot armor is a complete redesign that's an updated model.

==Other versions==
===American Son===
'''American Son''' is another exoskeleton used by [[Harry Osborn]] during the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #597-599.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent of Iron Patriot armor appears during the "United We Stand" storyline due to [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Tony Stark/Iron Man]] inspired by [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Steve Rogers/Captain America]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #19-21.
