'''Iron Patriot''' is a fictional [[powered exoskeleton]] used by several characters in [[Marvel Comics]]. The [[Aliases|alias]] is an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgam]] of [[Iron Man]]'s armor and [[Captain America]]'s colors.

==Fictional history==

===Norman Osborn===
'''[[Norman Osborn]]''' donned the original Iron Patriot armor during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline to exert his authority as 'commander' of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and [[Dark Avengers|his own personal Avengers]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref>

Iron Patriot's activities have been increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes such as when he was tricked into attacking [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] in an early Iron Man suit while suffering from brain damage and when the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] led by the new [[Bucky|Captain America]] (Bucky Barnes) used Iron Patriot's tracking device on [[Luke Cage]] as a trick to destroy his own house.<ref>''New Avengers'' #60</ref>

During his [[Siege (comics)|invasion]] of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] on the "claim" of a [[national security]] threat, Iron Patriot fights with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. But in the middle of Iron Patriot's fight with Rogers, Stark dismantles the Iron Patriot armor remotely, revealing Osborn's green facepaint with yellow eyes to create a goblin-like look as he tells them they are all dead as the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Void]] is released.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]]. ''Siege'' #1–4</ref> When Rogers, Stark and Thor transfer him to the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] penitentiary, Osborn blames his [[Green Goblin]] alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

===Backup Iron Patriot===
During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, a back-up Iron Patriot armor is seen amongst many Iron Man armors to assists the New Avengers against the new [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Red Skull]] (in her Skadi form) but the armors are vaporized by the female villain's new powers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #17</ref>

During the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a second back-up Iron Patriot armor is seen at a weapons expo that [[Daisy Johnson]] and [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] were attending. During the attack by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and their fight with the [[Secret Avengers]], [[Andrew Forson]] of the A.I.M. High Council takes the opportunity to steal the armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> The Iron Patriot armor was replicated and its low-level A.I. was grown considerably, creating an army of sentient Iron Patriot drones which A.I.M. used to incriminate the [[United States]] in numerous international attacks. When an army of Iron Patriot droids that were going to attack [[Iran]] appear, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sent the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to destroy the Iron Patriot droid army.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

===James Rhodes===
'''[[War Machine|James "Rhodey" Rhodes]]''' wears yet another back-up Iron Patriot armor per S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]]'s suggestion. Using holographic communication, S.H.I.E.L.D. hacks into the A.I.M. network which allows Rhodes to talk to the Iron Patriot suits. Rhodes makes the Iron Patriot army understand their programmed actions are wrong, and states he could teach them. In response, the Iron Patriot androids send Rhodes a new version of Iron Patriot armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

Later, Rhodes wears his Iron Patriot armor to apprehend [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] after he steals one of Iron Man's old suits. He ends up letting Gambit go after learning that he needs the technology to save the life of one of his friends.<ref>''Gambit'' vol. 3 #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Iron Patriot armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armors utilized repulsor technology, the original Iron Patriot design does not as "Oz is too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system so the chest's star shaped Uni Beam projector has a less powerful output.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List – Spider-Man'' #1</ref> However, the new Iron Patriot armor is a complete redesign that's an update of the previous model.

==Other versions==

===American Son===
The "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline established '''American Son''', another exoskeleton made from [[Iron Man]]'s arsenal with [[Captain America]]'s colors.

In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and related tie-ins to that storyline, [[Harry Osborn]] is approached with a job during his father [[Norman Osborn]]'s corrupt tenure as director of H.A.M.M.E.R., which temporarily replaced S.H.I.E.L.D.. To help his [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|fiancé]], Harry gains access to the American Son armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #597. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this was a ruse in which Norman would eventually arrange for American Son to publicly die tragically in order to increase sympathy for himself. After this discovery, Harry dons the American Son armor and fights Norman in the Iron Patriot armor to which the son came victorious over the father.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #599. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After their father's incarceration, [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel Stacy]] shoots Harry Osborn in the chest.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, American Son saves his brother. After his attempt on Harry's life, Gabriel confronts the American Son suit and demands to know why 'he' interfered.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is subsequently revealed that Gabriel has stolen the American Son armor and now suffers from a split personality. Gabriel himself commits crimes himself while his 'American Son' persona undoes the damage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During Gabriel's fight with [[Spider-Man]] and Harry, Harry hacked into the American Son armor and quickly over powers Gabriel. After he is defeated, Gabriel is placed in a psychiatric hospital and the American Son armor is thought to be destroyed. However, a package is soon delivered to his room containing American Son's helmet and a note from Norman telling him that he loves and misses Gabriel.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Iron Patriot===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Iron Patriot is '''[[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Antonio "Tony" Stark]]'''. In the "United We Stand" storyline in which a 'civil war' occurs throughout the United States, Stark repaints one of his [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] armors into the first Iron Patriot armor at the same time as [[Ultimate Captain America]] is elected President, and serves as  his new Secretary of Energy.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Iron Patriot armor is later destroyed by [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] but Stark uses a back-up Iron Patriot armor and eventually returns to his Iron Man persona.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref>
