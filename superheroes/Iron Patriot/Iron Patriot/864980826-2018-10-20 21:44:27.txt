==Fictional history==
===Norman Osborn===
{{Main article|Norman Osborn}}
[[Norman Osborn]] donned the original Iron Patriot armor during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline to exert his authority as 'commander' of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and his own [[Dark Avengers|personal Avengers]].<ref name="Dark Avengers #1">''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> Osborn's Iron Patriot's activities have been increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes such as when he was tricked into attacking [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (in an early Iron Man suit) and when the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] led by the new [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] (Bucky Barnes) used Iron Patriot's tracking device on [[Luke Cage]] as a trick to destroy his own house.<ref>''New Avengers'' #60</ref> During his [[Siege (comics)|invasion]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] on the "claim" of a [[national security]] threat, Osborn's Iron Patriot armor gets dismantled remotely by Stark in the middle of Osborn's fight with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], revealing Osborn's [[Green Goblin]]-like facepaint in fear of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Void]].<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]]. ''Siege'' #1–4</ref> When Rogers, Stark and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] transfer him to the Raft penitentiary, Osborn blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

===James Rhodes===
{{Main article|War Machine}}
During the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, another is seen at a weapons expo that [[Daisy Johnson]] and [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] were attending. During the attack by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (Advanced Idea Mechanics) and their fight with the [[Secret Avengers]] (which [[Rebel Ralston]] gets killed), the [[Andrew Forson|Scientist Supreme]] of the A.I.M. High Council takes the opportunity to steal the armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> The Iron Patriot armor was replicated and its low-level A.I. was grown considerably, creating an army of sentient Iron Patriot drones which A.I.M. used to incriminate the [[United States]] in numerous international attacks. When an army of Iron Patriot droids that were going to attack [[Iran]] appear, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sent the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to destroy the Iron Patriot droid army.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

[[War Machine|James Rhodes]] wears yet another back-up armor per S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]]'s suggestion. Using holographic communication, S.H.I.E.L.D. hacks into the A.I.M. network which allows Rhodes to talk to the Iron Patriot suits. Rhodes makes the Iron Patriot army understand their programmed actions are wrong, and states Rhodes could teach them. In response, the Iron Patriot androids send Rhodes a new version of Iron Patriot armor for a while.<ref name="Secret Avengers 6">''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

===Toni Ho===
{{Main article|Toni Ho}}
'''Dr. Toni Ho''' is [[Ho Yinsen]]'s daughter who is an engineer with three doctorates.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #1</ref> She first wore the Iron Patriot armor when she joined the [[U.S.Avengers]].<ref name="U.S. Avengers #1">''U.S. Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Iron Patriot armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in the helmet which allowed the suit to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armors utilized repulsor technology, the original Iron Patriot design did not as "[[Norman Osborn|Oz]] [was] too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system so the chest's star-shaped Uni Beam projector had a less powerful output.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List – Spider-Man'' #1</ref> However, the new Iron Patriot armor is a complete redesign that's an update of the previous model.

==Iron Patriot models==
There are different models of the Iron Patriot armor:

* '''Iron Patriot Armor Model 1''' - This was the first version of the Iron Patriot armor that was re-purposed from Iron Man Armor Model 25 by Norman Osborn. It's unibeam was modified to a star which reduced the energy that was released.<ref name="Dark Avengers #1"/>

* '''Iron Patriot Armor Model 2''' - This version of the Iron Patriot armor is worn by James Rhodes. This version sports tasers and retractable shoulder guns similar to the ones seen on the War Machine armor. It also has a stealth mode and a manual ejection protocol.<ref name="Secret Avengers 6"/>

* '''Iron Patriot Armor Model 3''' - This version of the Iron Patriot armor is worn by Toni Ho who designed it on her own after Avengers Idea Mechanics was merged with the American government to form the American Intelligence Mechanics. This version uses non-lethal weapons like microsonic attacks, gas pellets, and stun lasers. In addition, it can even produce a forcefield.<ref name="U.S. Avengers #1"/>

* '''Iron Patriot Armor Model 4''' - This version of the Iron Patriot armor is a heavy-combatant version that was created by Toni Ho. She first wore the armor when the U.S.Avengers attacked Golden Skull's All-In Casino. The Iron Patriot Armor Model 4 is not just a weapon as Toni Ho describes, it is also used for rescue operations. It can fire non-lethal concussive beams and enhances the wearer's strength.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Iron Patriot drones===
Later storylines show replicas of the Iron Patriot armor. During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, one is seen amongst Iron Man's many armors summoned to assists the New Avengers against the new [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Red Skull]] (in her Skadi form), and is vaporized with the other armors by the female villain's new powers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #17</ref>

During the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline, the Iron Patriot drones were disabled and badly damaged when the Secret Avengers were confronted by a vengeful Inhuman called the Junkman (who possesses the power of technopathy).<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

To help his [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|fiancé]], Harry gains access to the American Son armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #597.

Marvel Comics.</ref>

After their father's incarceration, [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel Stacy]] shoots Harry in the chest,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #1.

Gabriel himself commits crimes himself while his 'American Son' persona undoes the damage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During Gabriel's fight with [[Spider-Man]] and Harry, Harry hacked into the American Son armor and quickly overpowers Gabriel. After he is defeated, Gabriel is placed in a psychiatric hospital and the American Son armor is thought to be destroyed. However, a package is soon delivered to his room containing American Son's helmet and a note from Norman telling him that he loves and misses Gabriel.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
