'''Iron Patriot''' is a fictional [[powered exoskeleton]] used by several characters in [[Marvel Comics]]. The [[Aliases|alias]] is an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgam]] of [[Iron Man]]'s armor and [[Captain America]]'s [[American patriotism|patriotism]].

==Fictional history==

===Norman Osborn===
'''[[Norman Osborn]]''' donned the original Iron Patriot armor during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline to exert his authority as 'commander' of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and [[Dark Avengers|his own personal Avengers]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref>

Iron Patriot's activities have been increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes such as when he was tricked into attacking [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] in an early Iron Man suit and when the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] led by the new [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] (Bucky Barnes) used Iron Patriot's tracking device on [[Luke Cage]] as a trick to destroy his own house.<ref>''New Avengers'' #60</ref>

During his [[Siege (comics)|invasion]] of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] on the "claim" of a [[national security]] threat, Iron Patriot fights with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. But in the middle of Iron Patriot's fight with Rogers, Stark dismantles the Iron Patriot armor remotely, revealing Osborn's [[Green Goblin]]-like facepaint as he tells them they are all dead as the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Void]] is released.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]]. ''Siege'' #1–4</ref> When Rogers, Stark and Thor transfer him to the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] penitentiary, Osborn blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #16</ref>

===Backup armors===
During the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, a back-up Iron Patriot armor is seen amongst many Iron Man armors to assists the New Avengers against the new [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Red Skull]] (in her Skadi form) but the armors are vaporized by the female villain's new powers.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 4 #17</ref>

During the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a second back-up Iron Patriot armor is seen at a weapons expo that [[Daisy Johnson]] and [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] were attending. During the attack by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and their fight with the [[Secret Avengers]], [[Andrew Forson]] of the A.I.M. High Council takes the opportunity to steal the armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> The Iron Patriot armor was replicated and its low-level A.I. was grown considerably, creating an army of sentient Iron Patriot drones which A.I.M. used to incriminate the [[United States]] in numerous international attacks. When an army of Iron Patriot droids that were going to attack [[Iran]] appear, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sent the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to destroy the Iron Patriot droid army.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #4</ref>

[[War Machine]] (James Rhodes) wears yet another back-up Iron Patriot armor per S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]]'s suggestion. Using holographic communication, S.H.I.E.L.D. hacks into the A.I.M. network which allows Rhodes to talk to the Iron Patriot suits. Rhodes makes the Iron Patriot army understand their programmed actions are wrong, and states he could teach them. In response, the Iron Patriot androids send Rhodes a new version of Iron Patriot armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref> 

==Powers and abilities==
The Iron Patriot armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in his helmet which allowed him to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armors utilized repulsor technology, the original Iron Patriot design does not as "[[Norman Osborn|Oz]] is too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system so the chest's star shaped Uni Beam projector has a less powerful output.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List – Spider-Man'' #1</ref> However, the new Iron Patriot armor is a complete redesign that's an update of the previous model.

==Other versions==
===American Son===
The "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline established '''American Son''', another exoskeleton made from [[Iron Man]]'s arsenal with [[Captain America]]'s colors.

In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and related tie-ins to that storyline, [[Harry Osborn]] is approached with a job during his father [[Norman Osborn]]'s corrupt tenure as director of H.A.M.M.E.R., which temporarily replaced S.H.I.E.L.D.. To help his [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|fiancé]], Harry gains access to the American Son armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #597. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this was a ruse in which Norman would eventually arrange for American Son to publicly die tragically in order to increase sympathy for himself. After this discovery, Harry dons the American Son armor and fights Norman in the Iron Patriot armor to which the son came victorious over the father.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #599. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After their father's incarceration, [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel Stacy]] shoots Harry Osborn in the chest,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> but American Son saves his brother. After his attempt on Harry's life, Gabriel confronts the American Son suit and demands to know why 'he' interfered.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is subsequently revealed that Gabriel has stolen the American Son armor and now suffers from a split personality. Gabriel himself commits crimes himself while his 'American Son' persona undoes the damage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man presents: American Son'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During Gabriel's fight with [[Spider-Man]] and Harry, Harry hacked into the American Son armor and quickly over powers Gabriel. After he is defeated, Gabriel is placed in a psychiatric hospital and the American Son armor is thought to be destroyed. However, a package is soon delivered to his room containing American Son's helmet and a note from Norman telling him that he loves and misses Gabriel.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Iron Patriot appears during the "United We Stand" storyline when a 'civil war' occurs throughout the United States. As a response to [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] as the [[President of the United States]],<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]]'s [[List of Marvel Comics characters: A#Anthony|brain tumor consciousness]] uses the remote-controlled Iron Patriot armor to fight the Commander Crimson<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #21.
