'''General Immortus''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] villain. He first appeared in ''[[My Greatest Adventure]]'' #80, though this comes under dispute{{Fact|date=December 2007}} as his image is viewed in #79.

==Fictional character biography==
General Immortus was the leader of a criminal syndicate who had lived for centuries due to a life-extending potion. As his potion began to run out, he hired young scientist [[Chief (comics)|Niles Caulder]] to recreate the potion. When Caulder discovered Immortus's identity and plan, he sabotaged the "life extending ray" that he had been developing. Caulder, as "The Chief" later formed the [[Doom Patrol]] specifically to combat one of Immortus's later schemes. 

From time to time thereafter, Immortus sparred with the Doom Patrol, usually in an effort to force the Chief to reveal the secret of his life extending ray. Immortus was a one-time member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], a group formed largely to combat the Doom Patrol. 

Immortus was behind the seeming death of most of the original Doom Patrol when he threatens a small fishing town. The Patrol seemingly sacrifice their lives in order to save the innocent civilians.

A second Doom patrol was initiated by Mrs Caulder otherwise correctly known as Dr. Niles Caulder's child bride [[Celsius]]. In Showcase #95 he tortured her to find the secret to immortality, and managed to become young for the briefest moment on his Moon Base until the Doom Patrol got free and started to destroy the base, as he began regressing to an old man. The immortality failed because it was matched to Arani's physiology. A new Doom Patrol was born out of the actions of General Immortus.

In 2004, DC writer [[John Byrne]] restarted the Doom Patrol series and declared that the previous history had never happened, though this revision did not tamper with the history of all its villains, since their history had also been chronicled in various ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' books. Since ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', all Doom Patrol continuity Byrne attempted to wipe out is now largely chronicled, including that of General Immortus.

==Powers and abilities==
Immortus is a cunning criminal mastermind, and has lived for centuries as a result of his life-extending potion.

==Teen Titans animated series==

In the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans animated series]], Immortus is apparently much older than he was in the comic books. There are scenes of Immortus commanding troops in various battles going back to Phaeronic Egypt, and upon quoting [[The Art of War]] Immortus claims that [[Sun Tzu]] was one of his best students. According to [[Steve Dayton|Mento]] of the [[Doom Patrol]], Immortus is a master tactician as a result of his millennia of combat experience in virtually every major world conflict. It is not clear if the animated series Immortus is actually immortal, or has just been using his life extending potion for thousands of years, although the former is more likely (Immortus says, in regard to the Doom Patrol, "Persistent, yes. But not immortal!", implying that because he is immortal and they aren't, he has the advantage.) He commanded his robots to bring in [[Argent (comics)|Argent]]. During the final battle, he and his army was washed away by [[Aqualad]] and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Tramm|Tramm]]. Soon he was flash-frozen in "Titans Together". [[Xander Berkeley]], also voice of [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] and Mento of the [[Doom Patrol]], provides Immortus' wheezy British voice. His uniform resembles that of a Nazi officer, implying that he may have been a member, whilst his overall appearance is similar to [[Karl DÃ¶nitz]].

Apparently, he and the other villains were somehow freed, since he appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #32.  He also appears in issue #35 with [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] as his (temporary)foot soldier and a robot army of sladebots as his followers.  He attempts to infiltrate [[Titans Tower]] and use their giant defense robot against them, betraying Private H.I.V.E. in the process.  He is quickly defeated.
