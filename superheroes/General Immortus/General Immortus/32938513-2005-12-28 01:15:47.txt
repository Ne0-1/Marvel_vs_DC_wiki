'''General Immortus''' is a [[DC Comics]] villain.  He first appeared in [[My Greatest Adventure]] #80.

==Biography==
General Immortus was the leader of a criminal syndicate who had lived for centuries due to a life-extending potion.  As his potion began to run out, he hired young scientist [[Niles Caulder]] to recreate the potion.  When Caulder discovered Immortus's identity and plan, he sabotaged the "life extending ray" that he had been developing.  Caulder, as "The Chief" later formed the [[Doom Patrol]] specifically to combat one of Immortus's later schemes.  

From time to time thereafter, Immortus sparred with the Doom Patrol, usually in an effort to force the Chief to reveal the secret of his life extending ray.  Immortus was a one-time member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], a group formed largely to combat the Doom Patrol.  

In 2004, DC writer [[John Byrne]] restarted the Doom Patrol series and declared that the previous history had never happened.  It remains to be seen what history, if any, General Immortus now has.

==Powers and Abilities==
Immortus is a cunning criminal mastermind, and has lived for centuries as a result of his life-extending potion.

==Teen Titans animated series==

There are scenes of Immortus commanding troops in various battles going back to Phaeronic Egypt.  According to Mento of the [[Doom Patrol]], Immortus is a master tactician as a result of his millenia of combat experience.  It is not clear if the animated series Immortus is actually immortal, or has just been using his life extending potion for thousands of years.

Immortus appeared in:
*"Homecoming pt. 2"
