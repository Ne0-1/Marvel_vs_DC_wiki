'''General Immortus''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] villain. He first appeared in ''[[My Greatest Adventure]]'' #80, the first story in the "[[Doom Patrol]]" feature, though they all can be seen in artwork used in a "Next Issue" ad in #79. He has also been known to be called "The Forever Soldier" or "The Forever General".<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = General Immortus | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 136 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
General Immortus was the leader of a criminal syndicate who had lived for centuries due to a life-extending potion. As his potion began to run out, he hired young scientist [[Chief (comics)|Niles Caulder]] to recreate the potion. When Caulder discovered Immortus's identity and plan, he sabotaged the "life extending ray" that he had been developing.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Caulder, as "The Chief" later formed the [[Doom Patrol]] specifically to combat one of Immortus's later schemes.<ref name="dc-doom">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Doom Patrol | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 109  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

From time to time thereafter, Immortus sparred with the Doom Patrol, usually in an effort to obtain the results of the Chief's life-extension research. Immortus was a one-time member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], a group formed largely to combat the Doom Patrol. 

A second Doom patrol was initiated by an [[India]]n woman named Arani, claiming to be Mrs. Niles Caulder and calling herself [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]]. In ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #95, the general submitted her to a mind scan to find the secret to immortality, and managed to become young for the briefest moment on his Moon Base until the Doom Patrol got free and started to destroy the base as he began regressing to his former [[senescence]]. It turned out the immortality treatment failed because it had been prepared specifically for Arani's physiology.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In 2004, DC writer [[John Byrne]] restarted the Doom Patrol series and declared that the previous history had never happened, though this revision did not tamper with the history of all its villains, since their history had also been chronicled in various ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' books. Since ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', all Doom Patrol continuity Byrne attempted to wipe out is now largely restored, including that of General Immortus.

He was seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', where he was killed by [[Parademon]]s in the final issue.

==Powers and abilities==
Immortus is a cunning criminal mastermind, and has lived for centuries as a result of his life-extending potion.

In the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans animated series]], Immortus (voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]]) is apparently much older than he was in the comic books. There are scenes of Immortus commanding troops in various battles going back to Phaeronic Egypt, and upon quoting [[The Art of War]] Immortus claims that [[Sun Tzu]] was one of his best students. According to [[Steve Dayton|Mento]] of the [[Doom Patrol]], Immortus is a master tactician as a result of his millennia of combat experience in virtually every major world conflict. His uniform and the uniforms of his foot soldiers resemble those of the [[Wehrmacht]], implying that he may have been a Nazi party member, whilst his overall appearance is similar to [[Karl Dönitz]].

It is not clear if the animated series Immortus is actually immortal, or has just been using his life extending potion for thousands of years, although the former is more likely (Immortus says, in regard to the Doom Patrol, "Persistent, yes. But not immortal.")

Immortus commanded his robots to bring in [[Argent (comics)|Argent]]. During the final battle, he and his army was washed away by [[Aqualad]] and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Tramm|Tramm]]. Soon he was flash-frozen in "Titans Together".

Apparently, he and the other villains were somehow freed, since he appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #32.  He also appears in issue #35 with [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] as his (temporary) foot soldier and a robot army of sladebots as his followers.  He attempts to infiltrate [[Titans Tower]] and use their giant defense robot against them, betraying Private H.I.V.E. in the process.  He is quickly defeated.
