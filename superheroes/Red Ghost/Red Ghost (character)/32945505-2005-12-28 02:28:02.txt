'''The Red Ghost and his super-apes''' are a group of [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain|supervillains]], who started their career fighting the [[Fantastic Four]], before confronting other Marvel heroes like [[Iron Man]] and [[Spider-Man]]. 

The characters were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''Fantastic Four'' #13 (April, 1963) and #29 (August, 1964).

==Origins and powers==
Before becoming the Red Ghost, Ivan Kragoff was a [[Soviet]] scientist bent on beating the [[United States|Americans]] to the [[moon]] and claiming it for the communist empire. He assembled a crew of three trained apes, a [[gorilla]], a [[baboon]] and an [[orangutan]], and took off on his lunar trip, while on the very next panel, the FF were aiming their own rocket for the same destination.

Kragoff knew enough of the FF's history, and he purposefully designed his rocket in such a way that he and his crew would be heavily exposed to the cosmic rays that would, he expected, give them superpowers. This they did: Kragoff can become intangible and invisible like a "ghost", comrade Gorilla is super-strong, the Baboon is a [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] and can transform into anything, and finally the Orangutan controls [[magnetism]] like the [[Magneto (comics)|X-Men's arch-enemy]]. Additionally they all became smarter (the apes, not Kragoff).
These superhuman abilities parallel, and even surpass, the FF's own ones, which is probably logical considering the way they were acquired, and makes for great fight scenes.
