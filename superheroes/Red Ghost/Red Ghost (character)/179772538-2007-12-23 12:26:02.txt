'''The Red Ghost''' ('''Ivan Kragoff''') and his '''Super-Apes''' ('''Mikhlo, Igor and Peotr''') are a group of [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]s, who started their career fighting the [[Fantastic Four]], before confronting other Marvel heroes like [[Iron Man]] and [[Spider-Man]].  The characters were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''Fantastic Four'' #13 (April, 1963) and #29 (August, 1964).

==Fictional character biography==
Ivan Kragoff was born in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], in what was at the time the [[Soviet Union]]. Before becoming the Red Ghost, Ivan was a [[Soviet]] scientist bent on beating the [[United States|Americans]] to the [[moon]] and claiming it for the [[Communist]] empire.  He assembled a crew of three apes — '''Mikhlo the [[Gorilla]]''', '''Igor the [[Baboon]]''', and '''Peotr the [[Orangutan]]''' — which he subjected to specialized training regimens of his own design, then took off on his lunar trip, while on the very next panel, the FF were aiming their own rocket for the same destination.

Kragoff knew enough of the Fantastic Four's history, and he purposefully designed his rocket in such a way that he and his crew would be heavily exposed to the [[cosmic ray]]s that would, he expected, give them superpowers. This they did: Kragoff gained the ability to become as intangible and invisible as a "ghost", Mikhlo became super-strong and super-durable, Igor gained the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and could transform into nearly anything, and Peotr gained the ability to control either [[gravity]] (like [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]) or [[magnetism]] (like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]) (accounts vary by writer). Additionally the apes became smarter. Probably thanks to the similar origins, these superhuman abilities parallel, and even surpass, the Fantastic Four's own.

===Additional Exposures===
Kragoff next experimented with a cosmic-ray intensifier to attempt to increase his own superhuman powers but instead unintentionally caused himself to be unable to leave a state of intangibility. He had his supersimians kidnap Anthony Stark and forced him to build a “cosmitronic cannon" and return him to a tangible state. But when next Kragoff became intangible, his atoms began to disperse as a side effect of his treatment with the cannon. Kragoff’s consciousness managed to force his atoms to remain together, although his body remained in an intangible and, at times, invisible state.

Months later, Mister Fantastic went into space to expose himself to cosmic radiation to revitalize his own powers. Unknown to Richards, Kragoff, still intangible, was also aboard the spaceship. Kragoff used his invisibility to hide from Richards for days until he was able to immerse himself into cosmic radiation. The radiation restored his powers to what they originally had been. The Red Ghost could again become tangible or intangible and visible and invisible at will. He even gained the power to make other objects in his vicinity intangible. He used these powers to attack Quesar during the Acts of Vengeance.

=== Super-Apes on their own ===
The Super-Apes later show up and had divorced themselves from the Red Ghost and had started a life of crime on their own by taking over a private [[zoo]] in Salina, Kansas. They had turned the animals against the local population and captured three members of the New Warriors when they enter the complex. Instead of fighting their way out of the situation, they used their intellects and settled on a peaceful co-existence with the people of the town.

===Regression and progression===
Shortly after the [[Heroes Return|Fantastic Four returned]] from a pocket dimension created by [[Franklin Richards]], the Super-Apes had gained high levels of intelligence and were working on a virus that would take out humans, leaving simians dominant. The Red Ghost, conversely, had degenerated into a child-like mental state and spent most of the time interested in a bunny rabbit.

===Wild Kingdom===
The Red Ghost and the Super-Apes resurfaced in the with the Red Ghost back to his original intelligence level. They attempted to build a new Communist state in the political vacuum of Niganda - the Socialist Simian Republic of Niganda, "A country where a new form of Marxist-Leninist socialism can grow, based on the purity of the ape world."

==Powers and abilities==
The Red Ghost possesses the ability to become intangible at will.  Through concentration, the Red Ghost can achieve different degrees of intangibility and can even become like a diffuse mist.  He can either float while intangible or walk on air (in a manner similar to [[Shadowcat]]).  The Red Ghost can become transparent or invisible when in intangible form, to the extent that he has not registered with the sensitive equipment of Reed Richards was unable to detect him hiding in the same spacecraft over several days. The Red Ghost can alter the tangibility of parts of his body independently of each other. Thus he can grab an object in a hand while the rest of his body remains intangible. Since his additional exposures to cosmic rays, Red Ghost can make people and objects become intangible if they are nearby or in his field of vision.  While he is intangible, his body metabolism enables him to go without eating or without breathing for extended periods of time.

==Achievements==
The Red Ghost is a scientific genius in fields including rocketry, engineering, communications, genetics, robotics, physics, hypnotism, and the training of simians.  He has perfected forcefield devices, devices to mentally communicate with and control other primates, a cosmitronic gun, freeze ray pistols, rocket fuel from material found in a meteorite crater, and spacecraft made of transparent ceramic plastic to be unshielded against cosmic ray storms.  He has studied various forms of socialist and communist theory.

==In other media==

*The Red Ghost appeared in the 1960's ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' TV series.

The Fantastic Four fight him and his apes on a space station. He reveals to them that Galactus is coming, and that they must stay on the station if they hope to survive. In the end, the four escape and tell him to come with them off the station (which is self destructing), but he refuses and disappears when they leave. It is unknown if he survived.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Red Ghost===
The [[Ultimate Universe]] version of Ivan Kragoff was introduced in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #47 (Dec 2007). He is based in a laborarory in [[Siberia]], and is first seen experimenting on a bear named Misha, with the ability to talk. He is in contact with Dr [[Franklin Storm#Ultimate Franklin Storm|Franklin Storm]], and persuades Storm that Sue and Reed might be interested in his work. His assistant Sorba then destroys their plane with a beam weapon and captures them. It appears Kragoff's work is focussed towards reviving a woman named Irina, whom Storm believes dead. Sorba later stabs Kragoff, and reveals that she plans on using a beam of energy from the [[N-Zone]] to merge the herself with Sue so that she can gain her powers and use them to destroy those that she believes are harming nature. As the beam is about to combine the two, Sue escapes and the beam hits Sorba and several viles of simian DNA. When the smoke clears it is revealed that Sorba has become a gigantic, deformed, gorilla-like creature with multiple limbs and heads. She begins to attack Sue as Reed, Johnny, Ben, and [[Crimson Dynamo#Ultimate Crimson Dynamo|The Crimson Dynamo]] rush to save her.
