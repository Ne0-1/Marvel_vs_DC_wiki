Super-Turtle was created by cartoonist [[Henry Boltinoff]] (1914-2001), a native New Yorker whose work had appeared in Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post, and dozens of other publications prior to DC hiring him in 1940 to do one or two-page gag fillers. Boltinoff’s work appeared in countless DC books for the next several decades. His numerous cartoon creations include Casey the Cop, Moolah the Mystic, Cap's Hobby Hints, Little Pete, and the subject of today’s DIAL B for BLOG.
