'''Master Mold''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[robot]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Since his primary purpose was to act as a portable [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]]-creating factory, and the Sentinel robots were primarily used to hunt [[mutants]], Master Mold has almost exclusively appeared in the [[X-Men]] and related, mutant-themed, comic books.

==Publication history==
The Master Mold first appeared in ''X-Men'' #15-16 (December 1965-January 1966), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

The character subsequently appears in ''The Incredible Hulk Annual'' #7 (1978), ''X-Factor'' #13-14 (February-March 1987), ''Power Pack'' #36 (April 1988), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #18-24 (May-July 1989), ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #246-247 (July-August 1989), ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #30 (August 1991), and ''Cyclops: Retribution'' #1 (January 1994).

The Master Mold received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #5.

==Fictional character biography==
Master Mold was created by Dr. [[Bolivar Trask]] during the original run of X-Men comics. In the 1960s, out of fear of a race of superhuman mutants that could dominate the whole world and enslave normal human beings, Trask makes Master Mold, a super-computer, in the shape of a giant Sentinel robot, that will control and facilitate the construction of the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] (mechanical warriors that are programmed to hunt and capture all superhuman mutants). Unbeknownst to all, the original Master Mold is also programmed by the time-traveling Tanya Trask (aka [[Madame Sanctity]]), part of the Askani Sisterhood, with the mission to find and destroy [[Apocalypse: The Twelve#The Twelve|The Twelve]]: a group of mutants that are linked to the rise of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], which the ruthless Sanctity considered an event that must be stopped at all costs. For unknown reasons, some of the mutants that are catalogued as the Twelve are not part of the group.

The original Master Mold is eventually destroyed, but several others are later built by other people who want to manufacture Sentinels. In the late 1980s, the remains of Master Mold merges with the advanced Sentinel from the future, [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], thanks to the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to form the being called [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], which acts like an almost-human Master Mold during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Another Master Mold appeared in Incredible Hulk Annual #7. It claimed to be [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]], who was thought to be dead after Project Armageddon. It said that he (as Steven Lang) did not die immediately from the crash of his flying gunship, he managed to pull himself out of the wreckage and crawl to his greatest weapon, Master Mold, which merged with Lang when he tried to activate it. It was nearly destroyed by [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who was with Angel and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] in Master Mold's meteor space base. Then it was completely destroyed when the asteroid exploded, right after Hulk, Angel and Iceman managed to escape.

Master Mold also claimed the name and identity of Stephen Lang during a story arc running from issues 17 through 24 of ''Marvel Comics Presents''. In this story, later reprinted in the graphic novel, ''Cyclops: Retribution'', Master Mold creates a virus designed to wipe out mutantkind called the Retribution Virus. During this arc, it is revealed that he blames Cyclops entirely for his death as Stephen Lang. He hypnotizes [[Moira MacTaggart]] and uses her to unleash the virus, infecting Cyclops, [[Callisto]], and [[Banshee]], who is completely incapacitated. However, MacTaggart breaks free of his grasp. While she attempts to cure the virus, Cyclops and Callisto team up with Conscience, another artificial construct developed from Stephen Lang's brain engrams, to stop Master Mold and save not only mutantkind, but also humanity, which had become threatened by the virus. Cyclops, though weakened from the effects of the disease, nearly single-handedly destroys the Master Mold before finally succumbing to his illness and falling unconscious. As Master Mold prepares to kill Cyclops and finish unleashing the virus, he is suddenly attacked by a cured Banshee, who uses his sonic scream to "finish the job that Cyclops started" and destroys Master Mold. The virus is then cured before it has a chance to spread.

Another Master Mold is built in secret in the jungles of Ecuador. This particular Master Mold builds a new breed of Sentinels, known as Wild Sentinels, which are capable of assimilating non-organic materials to assume different shapes, most of them insectoid, as well as a breed of Nano-Sentinels. This Master Mold is taken over by [[Cassandra Nova]], who uses the Wild Sentinels to destroy [[Genosha]] and in her subsequent plan to destroy the X-Men. Following their defeat at the hands of Rogue's X-Men team, the Children of the Vault escaped and regrouped in the Ecuadorian Master Mold.

The Master Mold will return in ''Uncanny X-Men #500''.

==Capabilities==
Dr. Bolivar Trask equipped Master Mold with powerful weaponry and the ability to speak; Master Mold was also mobile so that it could defend itself from mutant attackers or so that it can be relocated easily if Trask had to find a new headquarters.

==Other versions==
In ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'', one of [[Madison Jeffries]]'s Boxbots dubbed ''Bot'' becomes the new Master Mold and traps Jeffries' within its body in order to use his powers to build new Sentinels without exhausting Jeffries.

==Other media==
===''X-Men'' animated series===
[[Image:Mastermold2.jpg|Master Mold in the X-men Animated Series|right|thumb]]
Master Mold also serves an important role during the first season of the mid-1990s [[X-Men (animated series)|''X-Men'' animated series]].  In one episode, the X-Men [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] are kidnapped by Sentinels, sent by Trask and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], while vacationing on the fictional island of [[Genosha]]. There, the three X-Men, along with several other mutants, are enslaved by Trask and Gyrich who are harnessing the mutants' powers to create a massive [[dam]] in Genosha whose [[water power]] will be used to run Trask's newly-created Master Mold.

The X-Men eventually escape Genosha and destroy most of the Sentinels by Storm's flooding the dam. Later on in the season, they learn that Trask has lost control of Master Mold, who is now stationed in [[Washington, D.C.]] Master Mold has [[Senator Kelly]], and dozens of other important world leaders, kidnapped and demands that Trask replace their brains with computers that can be controlled by Master Mold. Master Mold rationalizes that his created purpose to protect humans from mutants is illogical, since mutants themselves are humans, so he tells Trask that he and his Sentinels are the only things that could protect humanity from itself. The X-Men help rescue Trask and Kelly from Master Mold, and at the end of the season's last episode, [[Professor X]]avier, with the help of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], flies the X-Men's jet full of explosives into Master Mold's torso.

Master Mold and all Sentinels are believed to be destroyed at this point, but they resurface in season four. It is revealed that several Sentinels, and Master Mold's head and intelligence, had survived Xavier's attack. Master Mold was commissioning Sentinels to steal top-secret, indestructible lightweight plastics in order to create a new body for himself. He also had Sentinels kidnap his creators, Trask and Gyrich, whom he felt had betrayed him, as well as Xavier, whom he blamed from having destroyed his body. The X-Men eventually freed them and [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] destroyed Master Mold's head once and for all.

However, in [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop's]] timeline, Master Mold has been rebuilt and rules the United States (similar to [[Skynet (fictional)|Skynet]] in the [[nuclear warfare|post-apocalyptic]] future seen in the [[Terminator series|Terminator]] film series), using the Sentinels to hunt down mutants who are put in concentration camps.

===''Wolverine and the X-Men''===
Master Mold also appears in the new cartoon ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', although Judging by the voice and shape, this version appears to be female. She was created by [[Bolivar Trask]] to create and control the Sentinels. However, in the future, Mold has gained complete control over the world, having its Sentinels detain mutants, taking them to replicate their powers, to evolve. Humans such as [[John Wraith|Colonel Moss]] were made into cyborgs and placed as the wardens of the detention facilities. When Professor X was sighted, Mold ordered him to be captured, alive.

===Computer and video games===
Although Sentinels appear in many [[Video game|computer and video games]], Master Mold appears in only a few ones:  


* He appears in the background of the Sentinel processing plant combat area of the [[video game]] ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (arcade game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''. He lifts off if the Sentinel wins, is destroyed if the Sentinel loses.
* In 2004's ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', Master Mold, actually a giant Sentinel piloted by anti-mutant extremist General Kincaid, is the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] of the game.
* Master Mold appears as the final boss for Cyclops' stage in the 1992 game ''[[Spider-Man and the X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', but his name was mistakenly put as ''Master Blast'' in the back of the box of the cartridges and the advertisements.
* In ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'', Master Mold serves as the chief antagonist. In this continuity, Master Mold was a project developed by [[William Stryker]] in the bowels of Alkali Lake. On a trip back, The Master Mold is re-activated by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Stryker]], who survived the events of X2, and set out to finish his father's work.
