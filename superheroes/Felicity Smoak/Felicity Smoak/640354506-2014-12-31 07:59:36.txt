==Fictional character biography==
Portrayed as the manager of a New York computer software firm in her 1984 debut appearance, Firestorm first encountered her in the course of one of his battles with a villain, where he inadvertently magnetized and effectively destroyed several of the computers storing the software programs in development. This resulted in millions of dollars in property damage, which threatened to ruin the software firm and led to a heated confrontation between Felicity and Firestorm where she threatened to organize a class action lawsuit against him. Felicity would make recurring appearances, often taking an adversarial role against Firestorm and making a point of explaining what the collateral damage of his battles cost to her and other civilians. On one occasion, a frustrated Firestorm lashed out against Felicity's confrontational behaviour by using his molecular transmutation powers to transform her clothes to soap sud, a tactic he previously used on the supervillain [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]]. Humiliated from being rendered nude in public, Felicity retaliated by filing a lawsuit against him.

At some point, Felicity developed a romantic relationship with Ronnie's father, reporter Ed Raymond. She had no idea that Ed's son Ronnie comprised one-half of the Firestorm gestalt entity. When Ronald discovered that Felicity was seeing his father, he was uncertain how to treat her due to their tumultuous past interactions. Over time, Felicity and Ed fell deeply in love and were married. After the wedding Felicity learned the truth about Ronnie's secret dual identity, but by this point she had forgiven him for his past transgressions and stopped berating him, although she would still insist on reminding him about the importance of using his superpowers in a responsible manner.

===The New 52===
DC Comics rebooted its comic properties in 2011 as part of a relaunch entitled [[The New 52]], jettisoning much of its old continuity to make way for fresh interpretations of existing characters and retellings of popular stories. The New 52 version of Felicity Smoak is introduced in 2014 in ''Green Arrow'' #35, the first issue of that book to be written by ''Arrow'' showrunner [[Andrew Kreisberg]]; his comic book version of Felicity is a close facsimile of the one seen in that show. In #35, she is introduced in an end-of-issue cliffhanger as an assassin out to kill Oliver, but quickly explains that while she is a hacker-for-hire who has "done questionable things" in her past, "leading a hero to his death isn't one of them", explaining she did not know her target was the Green Arrow when she accepted the job. After proving her hacker credentials by explaining to him that she knows his secret identity, as well as highly specific details from his superhero, personal, professional and family lives, she offers to become a part of his team out of a desire to help him save the city. Surmising that whoever hired her to kill Oliver has extremely evil plans, she teams up with Green Arrow to track down her client's other target, a woman named [[Mia Dearden]], who they soon discover is being pursued by the deadly archer [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]].

Felicity Smoak appears in the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', portrayed by [[Emily Bett Rickards]] as an I.T. expert and skilled hacker, an ally of [[Oliver Queen]] who can hack into electronic databases and computer files in order to help him accomplish his missions. Felicity also discloses her [[Jews|Jewish]] heritage in this series. 

Originally from [[Las Vegas]], Felicity Smoak feared becoming a [[cocktail waitress]] if she didn't go to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Her father abandoned her and her mother at a young age. While in college, Felicity was a member of a [[Hacktivism|hacktivist]] group, along with her boyfriend Cooper Seldon and Myron Forest. It was also revealed that her natural hair color is black (alluding to her original comic book counterpart) but dyed blonde. After a successful hack into a government database, Cooper is tracked down and arrested, protecting Felicity in the process. After Cooper's arrest, Felicity changed her look and personality from a [[cybergoth]] hacker to a more studious looking woman, dying her hair blonde in the process.

After graduating, Felicity moved to [[Star City (comics)|Starling City]], getting a job in the I.T. department of [[Queen Industries|Queen Consolidated]]. Here, she met Oliver Queen, a billionaire playboy who had just returned from being presumed dead for five years. Increasingly strange requests from Oliver caused Felicity to become suspicious of his true intentions; yet, Felicity felt extremely trusting towards Oliver despite all of his sketchy requests. Eventually, Oliver Queen revealed to Felicity his true identity as The Hood after being shot by his mother Moira. Although Felicity was wary of Oliver's killing ways, Felicity agreed to help Oliver with his crusade from time to time. Felicity became a major part of Oliver's team, eventually becoming a full-fledged member, becoming Oliver's main source for in-field information, hacking, and even duties such as undercover work and serving as the liaison between the Arrow and [[Larry Lance|Quentin Lance]] from the Starling City Police Department. 

Over the course of the series, attraction between Oliver and Felicity continues to grow; eventually Oliver realizes that he is in love with her during a preparation of a showdown between him and [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]]. However, Felicity becomes [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]'s vice president at Palmer Technologies after he bought Queen Consolidated, and Palmer becomes Felicity's suitor and thus Oliver's rival for her affection.  She is also a one-time love interest of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], a young CSI who operates as the superhero [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] at [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]].

Felicity also made guest appearances in the television series' spin-off ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''; she helps Barry and his partners against [[Captain Cold|Leonard Snart]] and later Team Arrow and Barry's team subsequently work together against [[Rainbow Raider|Ray Bivolo]] and [[Captain Boomerang|Digger Harkness]].
