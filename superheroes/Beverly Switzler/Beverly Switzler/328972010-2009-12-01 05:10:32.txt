Later Howard and Beverly find themselves unemployed and living in a shack in the middle of a garbage dumb. Beverly decides to look for work and is hired by a company called Globally Branded Content to be a supervisor for a boyband singer. She is surprised, however, to learn that her salary will be an unusually high $100,000 a year. She eventually learns that this is because the head of the company is Doctor Bong, who reveals that he still has feelings towards her. Howard also learns that Bong is the head of the company and attempts to rescue Beverly, only for Bong to throw him into a vat of chemicals, with the intention of killing him. Howard survives however, but his DNA is altered causing him to transform into a series of animals. Howard and Beverly then go home, only for Bong to repeatedly phone then and ask Beverly to continue her romantic affair with him. Upon learning that Beverly feels nothing towards him but hate, he tries to have her killed by informing the US Military Howard is an Al Quida terrorist by the name of Osama el-Braka (Braka is Arabic for duck), and that Beverly is his accomplice. The military them destroy their home and were going to kill Howard and Beverly, but since Howard was a rat and not a duck at the time they decide they must have gone to the wrong address. Seeing as they are now homeless, Howard and Beverly and their pet Pit Bull try to search for a hotel to stay in, but are rejected by most because they have no ID, no address, and because the hotels does not allow dogs or rodents. They were then arrested by police officers and Beverly's former classmate, Suzi Pazzuza, for disturbing the peace. When interrogating them she does believe either of their accounts, although they both manage to escape from police custody. Meanwhile, Doctor Bong hires an assassin to kill Howard and Beverly, but the assassin only agrees if Bong will bring him a bracelet which contains the power of the douchblade, will grant a female wearer superpowers. Although the assassin is male, he states that he is undergoing hormone treatment so that he can become a woman and wield the doucheblade. Bong learns learns that the douchblade is in possession of detective Pazuzu, so he and the assassin's son travel there to kill her and steal the doucheblade, although Beverly and Howard also learn this and travel to her home to protect her. A confrontation then ensures which ends with the Bracelet landing in Howard's wrist, causing him to transform into a woman and possess the douchblades powers. He then kills the assassin's son and was preparing to kill Bong when Beverly intervenes and tells Howard to stop, but tells Bong that if he ever interferes with her life again she will kill him. Bong accepts that the two no longer have feelings for one another and he leaves. Beverly and Doctor Bong have not encountered each other since.

===Civil War===
During the civil war event, Howard and Beverly attempt to register under the Superhuman Registration Act,  with Howard posing as a superhero and Beverly as his sidekick, because Beverly states that they could use the money paid to registered heroes.
