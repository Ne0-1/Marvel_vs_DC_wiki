''Validus'' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and a member of the [[Fatal Five]].

He posesses vast superhuman strength, enabling him to easily overpower even the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[Superboy]], who could move multiple planets with ease. In addition, he could fire "brain bolts", which were powerful enough to incapacitate [[Mon-El]] and Superboy with a single hit. He was also invulnerable to telepathy.

It was revealed much later in the Legion of Super-Heroes' storyline that Validus was the kidnapped child of [[Lightning Lad]] and [[Saturn Girl]].  

Post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], his origin was changed considerably; he was no longer sibling to [[Lightning Lad]] and [[Light Lass]], [[Darkseid]] had nothing to do with his creation, and he was also vastly weaker.
