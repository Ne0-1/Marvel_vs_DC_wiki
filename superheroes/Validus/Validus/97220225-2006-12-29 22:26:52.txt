'''Validus''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who is an enemy of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and a member of the [[Fatal Five]].

He possesses superhuman strength, enabling him to easily overpower even the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[Superboy]]; in fact, it took the combined strengths of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]ian-level heroes [[Superboy]], [[Mon-El]], and [[Ultra Boy]] to overpower him.  In addition, he could fire energy bolts known as 'mental lightning', which were powerful enough to incapacitate a Kryptonian or Daxamite with a single hit. He was also invulnerable to [[telepathy]].

In the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] universe, Validus killed the original [[Invisible Kid]].

It was revealed much later in the Legion of Super-Heroes' storyline that, as revenge for his defeat in The [[Great Darkness Saga]], [[Darkseid]] had kidnapped one of the twin children of [[Lightning Lad]] and [[Saturn Girl]] at birth.  He then sent the newborn back in time, cursed with a monstrous body and with near-mindlessness (that made him easily controlled by the likes of the [[Emerald Empress]]) with the idea that either the parent or the child would kill the other.

After [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], Validus' origin was changed considerably: he was no longer the child of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl, [[Darkseid]] had nothing to do with his creation, and he was also significantly weaker.
