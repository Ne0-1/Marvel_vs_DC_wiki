==Fictional character biography==
In the latter half of the 30th century, an entity known as the [[Sun-Eater]] threatened to consume Earth's sun, thus destroying the solar system. Desperate to stop the Sun-Eater's efforts, Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes recruited the aid of the Fatal Five. They discovered that Validus was among their ranks, but had no idea of his true parental heritage. The Fatal Five reluctantly agreed to help the Legion, and the Sun-Eater's efforts were averted. Validus remained a loyal member of the Fatal Five, always ready to do Tharok's bidding.<ref name="dc-fata"/> During one memorable altercation with the Legion, Validus killed [[Lyle Norg]], the original Invisible Kid. 

Validus' true origin stemmed from a diabolical plot by a powerful Legion foe. As revenge for his defeat in "[[The Great Darkness Saga]]", [[Darkseid]] kidnapped one of the identical twin children of [[Lightning Lad]] and [[Saturn Girl]] at birth. He then sent the newborn back in time, cursed with a monstrous body and near-mindlessness (that made him easily controlled by the likes of the [[Emerald Empress]]) with the idea that either the parent or the child would kill the other.

Years later, Validus fell under Darkseid's influence yet again. He manipulated Validus against Lightning Lad, placing him in a situation where the Legionnaire would be forced to kill him to save the life of his other son, Graym. Thanks to the efforts of Saturn Girl however, the plot was averted and both parents discovered that Validus was their child. Soon after, Validus reverted to his normal, human condition. His parents soon renamed him '''Garridan'''.

During the [[Legion of Super-Heroes#"Five Years Later"|"Five Years Later"]] era chronicled in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4), it was revealed that Darkseid's tampering with Garridan's body chemistry had spawned a new virus which [[Brainiac 5]] dubbed "The Validus Plague".  Only natives of [[Winath]] and [[Titan (DC comics)|Titan]] (the homeworlds of Garridan's parents) were susceptible to the disease, but for them it was fatal. As a result, Garridan was forced to wear a containment suit, allowing him mobility yet keeping him in perpetual medical [[quarantine]].  His replacement in the reformed Fatal Five was a similar enigmatic behemoth named "Mordecai" by Leland McCauley IV.

After the events of the ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries, Legion continuity was rebooted entirely, and Validus' origin was changed considerably. He was no longer the child of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl, [[Darkseid]] had nothing to do with his creation, and he was also significantly weaker. In the "[[Legion of Super-Heroes#.22Threeboot.22 continuity .282005.E2.80.94.29|Threeboot]]" continuity, Validus was the name of a nature spirit in the folklore of the planet of [[Winath]], known as the Lord of Lightning. [[Mekt Ranzz]] was a member of a cult that worshipped him. Since the Ranzzes gained their powers and left the planet the cult has grown considerably, seemingly granting everyone on Winath lightning powers. This was later revealed as the product of nanomachines in their blood.

On the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Validus as a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Injustice League]]. However, in the actual issue, he does not appear.

Validus (alongside the other Fatal Five members) were among the villains in [[Superboy-Prime]]'s [[Legion of Super-Villains]].<ref>As seen in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]''.</ref>  However, Garridan Ranzz (along with his twin brother Graym) was recently depicted as a young child living with Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad.<ref>''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' (vol. 6) #1 (July 2010).</ref>  Thus, it appears that Validus and Garridan are not the same being in current continuity; or that this Validus is from a different moment in time.

==Powers and abilities==
Validus possesses incalculable superhuman strength, enabling him to easily overpower even the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]; in fact, it took the combined strengths of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]ian-level heroes Superboy, [[Mon-El]], and [[Ultra Boy]] to overpower him. In addition, he was extremely resistant to all forms of harm, and could fire energy bolts from his brain which were powerful enough to incapacitate a Kryptonian or [[Daxam]]ite with a single hit. He was also immune to [[telepathy]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* Validus has appeared in "Far From Home", an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' with the other Fatal Five against the Legion. He had a robotic body in this series.

* Validus is a member of the Fatal Five in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' TV series with the other Fatal Five. No mention is made of Lightning Lad being his father. This version is vulnerable to telepathy, as [[Saturn Girl]] mind-controlled him in the pilot episode "Man of Tomorrow". In Season Two, Validus was eventually recruited by [[Imperiex]] when he released him. Imperiex appears to perfectly understand Validus' seemingly incoherent grunting; in "Message in a Bottle" he answers the brute's question as if he had spoken clearly. In the two-part Season Finale, Validus was turned into computer data by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] (in [[Brainiac 5]]'s body) when trying to help Imperiex. It is unknown if he was restored to normal like everyone else was.

===Toys===
* Validus was the Collect and Connect figure for the [[DC Universe Classics#Wave Fifteen|fifteenth wave]] of the [[DC Universe Classics]] line.
