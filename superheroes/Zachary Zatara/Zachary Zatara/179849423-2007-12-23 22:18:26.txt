'''Zachary Zatara''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]].

Zachary is a descendant of the [[Homo Magi]] just like his cousin [[Zatanna]] and uncle [[John Zatara]]. He first appeared in ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] (vol. 3)'' # 34, and was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Tony Daniel]].

==Fictional character biography==

After the events of [[Day of Vengeance]], when magic in the [[DC Universe]] was changed, Zachary developed abilities similar to his relatives, [[Zatanna|Zatanna Zatara]] and [[John Zatara]]. Calling himself the "most popular teenaged magician", he briefly joins the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Zachary has little tact, patience, and modesty when it comes to his skills. As a result, he was left with few to no friends amongst the Titans, many of whom looked at him as a selfish brat.

During the initial "auditions" for the Teen Titans, Zachary met with [[Kid Devil]] (Eddie Bloomberg), with whom he would share a very shaky friendship.  One night after performing as a stage magician in [[Metropolis]], Zachary is approached by Eddie, who asks him about a mysterious candle he found.  Zachary explains that Eddie's candle is magical in nature and Eddie lights it.  They are transported to [[Neron]]'s realm and meet Neron himself. Although Zachary advised him not to listen to Neron's offers, Eddie makes a deal with the demon where he is transformed into a real demon.  Neron then sends both the "new" Kid Devil and Zachary back to Earth.  Zachary reluctantly keeps Eddie's secret.

Zachary helped Eddie gain entrance into the Teen Titans, and together they have multiple adventures. They battle [[Kid Crusader]] and, during one stint, went to New [[Azarath]], where they were almost eaten by [[Phantasm (comics)|the Phantasm]].  Zachary would remain a Titan for several months, before eventually quitting because one of his female teammates was driving him crazy, destabilizing his powers. 

[[One Year Later]], he is performing as a professional stage magician in Japan with an attractive young Japanese assistant called "Bunny," who he treats with mixed amounts of kindness and condescension. The current Teen Titans come speak with him, as they are looking for [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. Zachary wants nothing to do with them and does not remember his times with Eddie or the Titans fondly. Still, he states that Raven had come to him in Japan and began to ask him "weird questions...about herself".<ref>''Teen Titans (vol. 3)'', # 39</ref>  After he kicks them out, it is revealed he possesses a secret photo of Raven.  At the last second, he tries to call Eddie back, but they have already left and he goes back to his show.

Although Zachary has a less than close relationship with the Titans, he does agree to aid Robin and Ravager defeat a gang of metahuman created by Robin's wanna-be nemisis, [[Dodge (comics)|Dodge]].

==Powers and abilities==

Like other members of the Zatara family, Zachary is able to manipulate magic by speaking spells backwards.  So far, his powers have been shown to affect inanimate objects, summon simple objects into existence, and transmogrify one object to another.

It is unknown how his magical strength level compares with his cousin Zatanna.  Probably, it is weaker since he states he can not affect human beings, although he can affect doves.

==Trivia==
*[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]] features a character Zatara, who is similar to Zachary Zatara in appearance, age, and reverse talking magic powers.  He is son of the late Zatanna and John Constantine, and the grandson of Giovanni Zatara. Besides being a magician, he inherited his father Constantine's ability to see the dead.

*In his appearance in ''52'', [[Keith Giffen]] drew Zatara in [[fishnets]] like his cousin Zatanna as a joke, stating "As a goof, in the breakdowns, I drew that new [Zatara] kid in Zatannaâ€™s fishnets-and-corset getup. The penciler actually drew him that way. My pleas to let it go through like that went unheeded."
