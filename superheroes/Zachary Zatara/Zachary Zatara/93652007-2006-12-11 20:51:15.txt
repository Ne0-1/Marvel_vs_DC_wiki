'''Zachary Zatara''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]].

Zachary is a descendant of the [[Homo Magi]] just like his cousin [[Zatanna]] and uncle [[John Zatara]]. He first appeared in ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] (vol. 3)'' # 34, and was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Tony Daniel]].

==History==
After the events of [[Day of Vengeance]], when magic in the [[DC Universe]] is changed, Zachary develops abilities similar to his relatives.  Calling himself the most popular teenaged magician, he briefly joins the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], but leaves because one of his female teammates was "driving [him] crazy".  During Zatara's tenure on the Titans, he and [[Kid Devil]] went to New [[Azarath]] and were almost eaten by [[Phantasm (comics)|the Phantasm]].

He is currently performing as a professional stage magician, along with an assistant called "Bunny".  The Teen Titans speak with him, as they track down [[Raven (comics)|Raven]].  According to Zachary, when Raven showed up, she began to ask him "weird questions... about [herself]".  <ref>''Teen Titans (vol. 3)'', # 39</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

As with the other members of the [[Zatara]] family, Zachary can use his magic to affect inanimate objects, by saying almost any desired effect backwards. For example, in ''Teen Titans'' issue 39, he simply says "Azzip" to summon warm pizza into his hands.

However, as he explains, he cannot affect people with these powers (unlike Zatanna). Though he has been shown to affect [[dove]]s with ease in one performance, the exact limit between small animals and humans is unclear.
