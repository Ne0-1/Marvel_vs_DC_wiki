'''Adam Warlock''' is a [[fictional character]] who originated in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], which owns all [[trademarks]] and [[copyrights]] pertaining to the character.  Although Warlock was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], who wrote and drew his first appearances in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' Vol. 1 #66 & 67, a later body of work written, and in some cases [[illustration|illustrated]], by [[Jim Starlin]], has come to be generally regarded as the definitive portrayal of the character. 

==Him==
Warlock began as "Him", an artificially-created human who was "born" in a cocoon at a scientific complex called "The Beehive". The goal of his creators, [[Enclave (comics)|the Enclave]], was to create and subsequently exploit the perfect human.  Shortly after he first sprang from his cocoon (which he is capable of creating around himself for protection and rejuvenation), he battled the Fantastic Four (''Fantastic Four'' #66-67), but soon became aware of his creators' plans for him and decided to rebel. Having not had a childhood or parents (in fact, having no life experience whatsoever other than the data implanted by the Enclave), Warlock was lacking in maturity and restraint. Seeing the problems of the world, the being known only as Him reformed his cocoon and fled into space, in slumber. However, he was soon caught in an asteroid shower and endangered, being saved in the nick of time by the alien being [[Watcher (comics)|the Watcher]], who sent Him back to earth. He ended up in a military atomic research center, which he took over after it was abandoned. It was here he came in contact with the mighty [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Seeing mankind's wrongs, Him despised humanity, and because of this (and the fact that he decided to take Thor's sometimes paramour [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] to become his mate) they did battle, finally fleeing from the raging thunder god, in his cocoon once more deciding not to have dealings with humans (''Thor'' v.1 #165-166, 1969). Later it is said that here Warlock died his first death.

In 1972 star Marvel creative team [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]] decided to revive Him as a hero, calling him "Adam Warlock" and testing him out in the first two issues of the new "tryout" series ''[[Marvel Premiere]]''.  Apparently reception was good, so they gave Warlock his own eponymous series.  Warlock, in his cocoon, comes in contact with the being known as the [[High Evolutionary]].  Under his guidance, Warlock's life was given direction and purpose, though to this day he remains arrogant and aloof.  Warlock also came into possession of the Soul Gem at this point.  The Soul Gem, one of the [[Infinity Gems]], allowed Warlock to sense the [[soul]]s of others and draw them into a dimension contained within the gem.

Warlock was transported to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], an attempt by the [[High Evolutionary]] to create a Utopian society out of the framework of the original Earth.  Unfortunately, it had fallen under the influence of the nefarious [[Man-Beast]], a [[wolf]] that had been genetically modified into humanoid form by the [[High Evolutionary]].  

The series went immediately downhill; by issue #2 creators Thomas and Kane had minimal involvement, and the plots became redundant, including absurd twists on classic Marvel characters with inconsistant artwork. The sales were so low that the magazine was discontinued with issue #8 (Oct. 1973), ending with a cliffhanger (Warlock finally facing supreme villain the Man-Wolf in the [[oval office]]). The story was finally concluded months later in the pages of ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' issues #176-178 (June-Aug, 1974), in which Warlock fights the Hulk, unites with him, then dies to save Counter-Earth. In the process of ending the Man-Beast's regime, Warlock's narcissism led him to another death, this time by crucifixion. He resurrected himself once more in his cocoon. Warlock's recreation of Christ's murder and rebirth on Counter-Earth led to the creation of a planet-wide organized religion; this also was the first step toward Warlock’s “God Complex”. At the end of ''Hulk'' #178, a seemingly enlightened Warlock leaves his followers with words of hope, and goes to seek out other worlds in need. He makes the "beast of humanity" metaphor very clear and flies away, not to be seen in print again for another few years.

==Thanos & The Magus==

Many famous comic characters experience a sort of "new origin"; a certain writer or artist (or occasionally both) does a defining run on the feature, solidifying the character beyond their original creation; [[Alan Moore]]'s work on [[Swamp Thing]], for instance, or [[John Byrne]]'s [[Superman]]. Comics auteur [[Jim Starlin]] has played a similar role for more than one Marvel hero; he brought his talents to bear on  Warlock beginning in Feb. 1975 in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #178. Starlin began with a brief outline of the character's history thus far, and opens his new storyline with Him standing on a desolate planet, lamenting his failure to accomplish the good he attempts and all the destruction he inadvertently causes (his attitude substantially changed from the enlightened optimistic stance of his last appearance). Soon he learns from a damsel in distress of an intergalactic menace known as the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], a powerful being who has set up a genocidal religion/militia known as The Universal Church of Truth, ruling a thousand worlds with an iron fist. Warlock feels compelled to battle evil once again, and with his mischievous new scantily clad, cigar-chomping friend [[Pip the Troll]], he journeys through many perils of the body, mind, and soul to the Magus himself. Warlock's trials include addiction to his aforementioned Soul Gem, resisting the temptation of a power-offering woman ruler, a massive one-sided trial against him, a simulated surreal clown-world (from which he emerges partially insane), and fighting lots and lots of alien grunts. It is revealed that the Magus is a future incarnation of Warlock himself, supremely powerful due to a near-infinity of metamorphosing in his cocoon, plus the natural knowledge of future events possessed by any time-lost future individual. The Magus was sent back in time by the cosmic being, the [[In-Betweener]] as a force for 'Life' to offset [[Thanos]]' role as a champion of Death.  The In-Betweener had driven the Magus mad and released him thousands of years in the past on a planet called Sirius X, which he would rename Homeworld. Thus Warlock finds he has this to look forward to.

After ''Strange Tales'' #181, the series continued directly to the now-resurrected ''Warlock'' #9 (the consecutive issues 8 and 9 were separated by two  years and seven Warlock appearances in other titles),  wherin Starlin continued the Warlock vs. His Future Self storyline, at the same time incorporating a continuation of the story of his mad villain Thanos, who was the focus of Starlin's epic run on ''[[Captain Marvel]]'' (#25-33, March 1973 - July 1974) and continues to be his most returned-to character today. Thanos (whose mysterious aims were totally unknown) also held the secret of time-travel and therefore was unseen by The Magus' knowledge of present/future events; he locked himself in mortal combat with the Magus, while Warlock entered Kismet (a dimension whose capabilities have yet to be fully explained), destroyed the timeline where he would become the Magus, and emerged in the future and took his future self's soul into the soul gem (for all intents and purposes killing him), retroactively preventing Magus from ever existing (thus having an early death at his own hands to look forward to instead of power and evil).  Starlin's under-the-radar philisophic and confusing plotline and psychedelic cosmic art was not immensely popular until years later, but it was enough for the Warlock series to continue, still under Starlin's control, even after the Magus story was concluded.

After a few filler issues and a bizarre storyline involving a comatose earthling slowly destroying the universe (concluding with Warlock apparently too physically large to go back to Earth due to a twisted extension of an obscure cosmic theory), loose ends seemingly begin to be tied with issue #15 (Nov. 1976) with Warlock deciding to continue his fight against evil and the beginning of more Thanos plot; unfortunately the series was cancelled again and there was no issue 16.

Warlock next made an appearance in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #55 (March 1977) also featuring Spider-Man and some of the [[Elders of the Universe]]. This was written by Bill Mantlo and drawn by then-unknown [[John Byrne]] and has little relevance to Starlin's meticulous storyline, but it introduced the fact that the Elders each possessed a gem similar to Warlock's.

Starlin finally got a chance to finish his epic in ''[[Avengers]] Annual'' #7 (1977), in which Thanos rises to attempt to destroy the universe a second time, killing Warlock's dearest friends Pip and [[Gamora]] (Thanos' attractive green-skinned ward and Warlock's possible love interest, introduced in the Magus storyline) though Warlock is able to take their souls into his gem, thus saving them (but just their souls). The Avengers get involved and, with his leadership, they nearly stop him. Warlock is taken out of the battle when the Warlock of a few months past comes to take his soul (see above), but he was content to leave his miserable existence and the end of the issue finds him in a green paradise with all the souls the gem had ever taken, living together in loving/accepting harmony. But Thanos is still on the loose; this is wrapped up in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]] Annual'' #2, in which Spider-Man and the Thing join the fray, and together earth's heroes (with a final appearance of Warlock from the grave) kill Thanos by turning him into a statue.

These issues proved popular enough to be collected in a six-volume deluxe-format miniseries in 1983, and again in 1992.

The story of Warlock was briefly revisited in ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #61-63 (March-May 1980) by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and Jerry Bingham, which finds The Thing coming into contact with [[Her (comics)|Her]], created by the Enclave to be the female equivalent of Him; she wants to find Warlock in order to become his mate.  After contact with [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]], [[Moondragon]], and the High Evolutionary, Warlock's grave is visited on Counter-Earth, and the High Evolutionary explains that Warlock's conveniently-forgotten too-big-to-be-in-the-world thing from the Starlin years was all in his head, tying up the last loose-end and proving finally that he was indeed dead.  Warlock did not appear again in the 1980's, even in Starlin's groundbreaking graphic novel, ''[[The Death of Captain Marvel]]''.

==The Infinity Gauntlet==
In 1990, Starlin began writing what was arguably his third character-defining run for Marvel, this time starring the [[Silver Surfer]] (''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #34-50, with the exception of #39, an unrelated filler story), drawn by [[Ron Lim]]. After Thanos' return at the bidding of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself, the mad villain collects all six [[Infinity Gems]] (in ''[[The Thanos Quest]]'' #1-2) and becomes [[omnipotence|omnipotent]]. The Surfer along with [[Drax the Destroyer]] is exiled by Thanos to the Soul Gem, and meets Warlock, Pip and Gamora. Warlock, who while living in the Soul World had taken to the life of a monk and had not fought since entering the Soul Gem, releases the Surfer and Drax from the Soul Gem, and soon after decides to take up the fight against Thanos himself.

The souls of Warlock, Pip and Gamora left the Soul Gem and inhabited recently-deceased corpses, which metamorphosed into their bodies (Warlock employing the cocoon technique for additional power). Once again the entire Marvel Universe is involved in the battle in a six-issue mini-series entitled ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]''. Warlock was instrumental in Thanos' defeat here as well, and in the end obtained the gems for himself.  Having lived so long in the Soul Gem's strange world and spent so much time with the gem he was able to understand the workings of Thanos and the Gauntlet, giving him an edge over his foe.  What made Warlock most ideal in leading the heroes and cosmic beings against Thanos was the fact he stood outside the realms of Order & Chaos because of the circumstances surrounding his conception, the trials of the Magus, and his time in Soul World.  Most importantly was no doubt the destruction of his own timeline, making it very hard to predict his fate.  This was clearly shown when [[Gamora]] wore the Time Gem and got inaccurate visions of Warlock's future, and explains why [[Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]] wished Warlock as their leader against Thanos (representing, paradoxically, the opposite of both). 

Warlock was soon forced to separate the Infinity Gauntlet's gems to separate bearers after the cosmic beings of the universe and the Living Tribunal deemed Warlock unworthy to carry the Infinity Gauntlet.  When Warlock asked why Thanos was allowed to wield the power, Warlock was told that it was because he was a being of existence and Warlock was a created being.  Warlock kept the Soul Gem for himself, and split the rest of the gems among the members of the [[Infinity Watch]] including his friends Pip and Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Moondragon, and one mysterious, unseen person who was later revealed to be Thanos himself.  Warlock was given his own series again, ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'', beginning in Feb. 1992, written by Starlin. Warlock's temporary possession of the Gauntlet had unforeseen consequences; in attempting to control his emotions to better wield the Gauntlet, Warlock purged all good and evil from his being, leaving him a being consisting entirely of logic.  The "moral" aspects of his persona in turn took on physical forms: the evil half became a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half became the self-styled [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]].  Each attempted to gain control over the universe, and each was thwarted and exiled to the world of the Soul Gem, where they had no substance and (Warlock assumed) would pose no threat to anyone (in ''[[Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Infinity Crusade]]'', completing the Infinity Trilogy of the early '90s). During this time Warlock was so popular he was given a second series, ''The Warlock Chronicles'' (beginning in July 1993).  ''Chronicles'' ended with issue #8 in February 1994, and Starlin's last issue on ''Watch'' was #33 (October 1994); the series continued for nine further issues, finally ending with the Gems being stolen by the alien vampire called [[Rune (Ultraverse)|Rune]] and the disbanding of the group in #42 (July 1995).

Some time later, Warlock was killed by Rune and the Gems disappeared into a parallel universe, the "[[Ultraverse]]", where Warlock found himself reborn.  Warlock eventually returned to the [[Marvel Universe]], and encountered Thanos and the former members of the Infinity Watch a number of times more.  He starred in a miniseries shortly thereafter, in which he fought the reanimated corpse of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]].

==Infinity Abyss and further adventures==

Warlock's next major appearance was in the ''Infinity Abyss'' miniseries.  Warlock was found to be living in an intergalactic Insane Asylum, encased in a self-generated cocoon.  Warlock was reincarnated with a slight different appearance after a clone of Thanos asked Moondragon to revive him.  Warlock assisted in preventing a universal crisis against [[Thanos]]' clones, and ended up watching over Atleza, a being posed to keep the cosmos from falling into the Infinity Abyss.  He also engaged in a relationship with Gamora.  Later, Warlock, being outside the cosmos then was able to convince Thanos to restore the Marvel Universe after he destroyed it after receiving ultimate power, assisted Thanos in his first reformed quest, and recently assisted [[She-Hulk]].

==2004 ''Warlock'' miniseries==
In the 2004 ''Warlock'' mini series by [[Greg Pak]], another Warlock was created by the Enclave.  This new Warlock was meant to be the savior of the human race.  He would be a god among men and 'fix' our world.  He had a failsafe device installed in his head (which resembled the placement of the Soul Gem) that prohibited him from questioning his role as god of Earth.  The new Warlock was befriended by his designer Janie.  Janie managed to get through to this Warlock and override his failsafe.  The new Warlock, confused by all the deception and the contradictory way of the human condition, chose to destroy the Earth.

All this, though, turned out to be an elaborate fantasy inside Janie's head and part of an attempt by the Enclave to condition her for their own purposes. However, the original Adam Warlock projects himself into the simulation and was able to give her a chance to see humanity and feel compassion for it in a way Him wasn't able to comprehend when he first emerged from the Enclave's labs. Janie emerges from her cocoon at the Enclave as a new Warlock and quickly leaves. The series concluded with her planning to help Earth in her own way having learned valuable lessons from the original Warlock.

==Trivia==
*Although the 1970s Starlin issues have been reprinted several times by Marvel Comics, other issues of the Warlock book (including The Counter-Earth saga and most of the Infinity Watch) have to this date not been reprinted.

*Starlin's ''Warlock'' was one of the series that got [[Scott McCloud]] interested in comics during his high school years.

*Having shared his soul with that of the Silver Surfer during the Infinity Gauntlet, Warlock gained the power to mentally control his board.  He also shared a telepathic link with the Soul Gem so could tell if the Gauntlet had a new owner.

*When Warlock gained the full might of the Gauntlet, he was able to shut off Drax The Destroyer’s hunger to kill Thanos.

*Warlock's gem made him more powerful than Mephisto in the devil's own realm.  Warlock stated that this was because Mephisto's realm was an aspect of Mephisto's soul, and the Soul Gem made Warlock the master of all souls.
