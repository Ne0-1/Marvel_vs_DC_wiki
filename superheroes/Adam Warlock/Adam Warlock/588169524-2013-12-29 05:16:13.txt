==Publication history==

===1960s to 1970s===
The character debuted in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #66-67 (Sept.-Oct. 1967) in a story written by [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciler|pencilled]] and co-plotted by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 124|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Adam Warlock was an artificial being created by scientists to be the first of an invincible army. Simply referred to as "Him' in his early appearances, Warlock later rebelled sgainst his creators in ''Fantastic Four'' #66.}}</ref> After a second appearance as "Him" in ''Thor'' #165-166 (June–July 1969), writer and then Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] and [[penciler]] [[Gil Kane]] significantly revamped Him as the [[allegory|allegorical]] [[Messiah]] '''Adam Warlock''' in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #1 (April 1972).<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: "Roy Thomas and artist Gil Kane allowed 'Him' to meet another Lee-Kirby character, the godlike High Evolutionary."</ref>

In 2009, Thomas explained he had been a fan of the soundtrack to the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and sought to bring the story to comic books in a superhero context: "Yes, I had some trepidation about the [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] parallels, but I hoped there would be little outcry if I handled it tastefully, since I was not really making any serious statement on religion... at least not overtly."  <ref name=backissuep3>{{cite journal|last = Walker|first = Karen|title = The Life and Death (and Life and Death) of Adam Warlock|magazine = [[Back Issue (magazine)|Back Issue]]|issue = 34|page = 3|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = June 2009}}</ref> Choosing to use a preexisting character while keeping the series locale separate from mainstream Marvel Earth, he created Counter-Earth, a new planet generated from a chunk of Earth and set in orbit on the opposite side of the sun.<ref name=backissuep4>Walker, p. 4</ref> Thomas and Kane collaborated on the costume, with the red tunic and golden lightning bolt as their homage to [[Fawcett Comics]]' 1940s-1950s character [[Captain Marvel (Fawcett Comics)|Captain Marvel]].<ref name=backissuep4 />

The story continued in the series ''The Power of Warlock'', which ran eight issues (Aug. 1972 - Oct. 1973),<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 156: "Adam Warlock received his own bimonthly comic book in August [1972], written by Roy Thomas and pencilled by Gil Kane."</ref> with some plotlines concluded in ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #176-178 (June-Aug. 1974).<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 166: "Adam Warlock  rose from the dead to defeat Man-Beast and his New Men on Counter-Earth in issue #178 of ''Incredible Hulk''."</ref>

In a 2009 retrospective survey of the character, writer Karen Walker said the series
{{quote|"... continued the story of Adam's attempts to drive the [fallen-angel figure the] [[Man-Beast]] out of Counter-Earth, but drifted toward standard superhero stories with pseudo-[[Biblical]] references injected into them. Warlock spends much of his time trying to convince the [[High Evolutionary]] not to destroy the planet, and the rest of his time battling the Man-Beast and his minions. Although the concept of a superhero savior was still present, it often came across as forced, and certainly contradictory to the idea of a pacifistic savior. It's questionable whether the concept could really work in a medium driven by physical conflict."<ref name=backissuep5>Walker, p. 5</ref>}}

Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] revived Warlock in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #178-181 (Feb.-Aug. 1975).<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 168: "Adam Warlock returned in a new series, taking over ''Strange Tales'' for four issues...The original ''Warlock'' comic book would return with issue #9 in October [1975]."</ref> Warlock's adventures became more cosmic in scope as Starlin took the character through an extended storyline referred to as "The Magus Saga."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/effect/109537201997793.htm|title= Warlock: The Magus Saga|first= Jim|last= Kingman|date=September 16, 2004|publisher= Comics Bulletin|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090114220900/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/effect/109537201997793.htm|archivedate= February 9, 2013|deadurl= yes|accessdate= February 9, 2013}}</ref>

The reimagined title continued the numbering of ''The Power of Warlock'' and began with ''Warlock'' #9 (Oct. 1975) and ran seven issues. The bimonthly series was initially written and drawn by Starlin, but was eventually co-penciled and inked by [[Steve Leialoha]]. Some plot threads were concluded in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #55 (March 1977), ''Avengers Annual'' #7 (Nov. 1977) and ''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #2 (Dec. 1977).<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 97|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= The spirit of the recently deceased Adam Warlock...reduced Thanos to a statue of hardened granite.}}</ref>

Starlin, in a 2009 interview, recalled,
{{bquote|"I had quit [the cosmic superhero series] ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'' over a dispute at that point,  but I settled the dispute with Marvel and I was going to come back [to that title]. But [a different team was in place]. So Roy [Thomas] asked me [what character] I wanted to do. So I went home that night and pulled out a bunch of comics. I came across, in the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', Him, and came back the next day and said that's who I wanted to do, and that night I started working on it... I had basically taken Captain Marvel, a warrior, and turned him into sort of a messiah-type character. So when I got to Warlock, I said to myself, 'I got a messiah right here to start off with; where do I go from there?' And I decided a [[paranoid]] [[schizophrenic]] was the route to take."<ref name=backissuep6>Walker, p. 6</ref>}}

Artist [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]] recalled in a 2006 interview there was a "lost" Adam Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the [[Jonathan Swift]] novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/warlock.htm|title= The Legendary 'Lost' Warlock|first= Daniel|last= Best|year= 2007|publisher= Adelaide Comics and Books|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120319195813/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/warlock.htm|archivedate= February 9, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> Portions of it were printed in the second volume of ''[[Marvel Masterworks]]: Warlock''.

Warlock's adventures were reprinted, with new Starlin covers, in the six-issue [[limited series]] ''Special Edition on Warlock'' (Dec. 1982 - May 1983).<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock.htm#S1175 ''Warlock Special Edition'' (1982-1983)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''. Note: The [[Grand Comics Database]] uses the title ''Warlock'' ([http://www.comics.org/series/2670/ ''Warlock'' Marvel, 1982 Series]), which is at odds with subsequent UHMCC volume numbers.</ref> This reprint series was itself reprinted, with yet another set of new Starlin covers, as ''Warlock'' vol. 2 (May-Oct. 1992).<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock2.htm#S239 ''Warlock'' (II) (1992)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''</ref>

Although regarded as deceased, Warlock made a brief appearance in a ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #63 (May 1980).
{{-}}

===1990s revival===
Eleven years later, Starlin revived the character and two members of his supporting cast in the [[miniseries]] ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991).<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 254: "With the help of Dr. Strange, Warlock amassed a small army of heroes in order to confront Thanos head-on at his headquarters."</ref><ref>Cowsill, Alan "1990s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 192: "Marvel's cosmic heroes joined forces with Spider-Man, Adam Warlock, and a host of earth-based heroes to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos."</ref> This plot development was a continuation of a larger storyline that began with the resurrection of [[Thanos]] in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990).

Following the events of the ''The Infinity Gauntlet'', Warlock and several compatriots starred in the series ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch''. Initially written by Starlin and drawn by [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]], it ran 42 issues (Feb. 1992 - Aug. 1995). Its plots tied directly into the limited series ''Infinity War'' (June-Nov. 1992) and ''Infinity Crusade'' (June-Dec. 1993).

Warlock starred in several limited series, including ''Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection'' #1-4 (March–June 1993); ''The Warlock Chronicles'' #1-8 (July 1993 - Feb.1994); and ''Warlock'' vol. 3, #1-4 (Nov. 1998 - Feb. 1999), by writer-penciler [[Tom Lyle]].<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock.htm#S612 ''Warlock'' (III) (1998-1999)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''</ref> The character was featured in the [[intercompany crossover]]s between [[Marvel Comics]] and the [[Malibu Comics]] "[[Ultraverse]]" in the [[one shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Rune / Silver Surfer'' (April 1995 in indicia, June 1995 on cover); ''[[Rune (comics)|Rune]]'' vol. 2, #1-7 (Sept. 1995 - April 1996), and the two-issue ''Ultraverse Unlimited'' (June and Sept. 1996).

Following the unrelated, 1999-2000 series ''Warlock'' vol. 4, featuring the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[cybernetic]] character [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] of the [[New Mutants]] team,<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/mtech.htm#S695 ''Warlock''(IV) (Mutant Alien) (1999-2000)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''</ref> Adam Warlock co-starred with Thanos in the limited series ''The [[Infinity Abyss]]'' #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002); ''[[Marvel Universe: The End]]'' #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003; first four issues biweekly); and ''Thanos'' #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April 2004). A version of the character starred in the four-issue limited series ''Warlock'' vol. 5 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005), by writer [[Greg Pak]] and artist [[Charles Adlard]]. After appearances in ''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007) and ''[[Annihilation Conquest]]'' # 1-6 (Nov. 2007 - April 2008), he was a key character in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' vol. 2, #1-25 (July 2008 - April 2010), ''The Thanos Imperative'' #1 (June 2010) and the ''Ignition'' one-shot (May 2010)

During Warlock's temporary possession of the Gauntlet, he purges all good and evil from his being, leaving him entirely a creature of logic.

===Annihilation: Conquest===
Warlock is incapacitated by the backlash of souls killed during the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" war, and re-enters hibernation in a cocoon.

==Powers and abilities==
As Him, the character possessed superhuman strength; speed; durability; stamina; agility and the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for energy projection, flight and recuperation (e.g. creating a cocoon for self-preservation and regeneration). However, Him sacrificed the majority of these powers by prematurely emerging from his cocoon in order to defend the High Evolutionary from an assault by the Man-Beast. In compensation, the High Evolutionary gave Him the Soul Gem.<ref name="Premiere" /> The Gem possesses a consciousness of its own and demonstrates a vampiric hunger for the life energies of organic beings. It contains an idyllic [[pocket universe]] that hosts all the souls the Gem has ever taken. The latest version of Warlock uses "Quantum magic" and can manipulate energy; create force fields; teleport; travel faster than light and detect or produce [[wormholes]] and other irregularities in space on a cosmic scale.

He has the power to devolve the followers of Man-Beast into the animals from which they evolved,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy; [[Mike Friedrich|Friedrich, Mike]]|penciller= Kane, Gil; [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]; [[Tom Sutton|Sutton, Tom]]|inker= Sutton, Tom|story= Count-Down For Counter-Earth|title= Warlock|issue= 2|date= Oct. 1972}}</ref> as well as revert the [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Brute]] into Counter-Earth Reed Richards.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy; [[Ron Goulart|Goulart, Ron]]; Friedrich, Mike|penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]|inker= Sutton, Tom|story= The Brute|title= Warlock|issue= 6|date= June 1973}}</ref> This power comes from his soul gem.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Friedrich, Mike|penciller= Brown, Bob|inker= Sutton, Tom|story= Confrontation|title= Warlock|issue= 8|date= Oct. 1973}}</ref>

==Other versions==

===The Magus===
[[Image:Themagusoriginal.png|thumb|220px|The Magus, from ''Strange Tales'' #181 (Aug. 1975). Art by [[Jim Starlin]].]]
The Magus is Adam Warlock's future, evil self who has traveled to the past and rules a religious empire called the [[Universal Church of Truth]]. The Magus guides Warlock through a series of actions that will eventually result in him becoming the Magus.<ref name="ST178" /><ref name="ST179" /><ref name="ST180" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= 1000 Clowns!|title= Strange Tales|issue= 181|date= Aug. 1975}}</ref> Warlock resists, and avoids becoming the Magus with the aid of [[Thanos]]. When Warlock successfully chooses a different future - suicide - the Magus ceases to exist.<ref name="Warlock11" />

Warlock is later resurrected and acquires the [[Infinity Gauntlet (weapon)|Infinity Gauntlet]],<ref name="Gauntlet6" /> a powerful artifact. He uses it to expel his evil psyche, which takes physical form as the Magus. The Magus wages [[Infinity War|war]] on Warlock and other superheroes in an attempt to gain the Infinity Gauntlet for himself, but fails. After the Magus is defeated, he is trapped in a soul dimension as a phantom.<ref name="InfinityWar" />

The Magus escapes the Soul Gem in an immaterial form. He absorbs the life energies of others to regain his physical form and power, and schemes to usurp the cosmic power of [[Genis-Vell]]. Genis defeats the Magus and reverts him back to an energy form.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter David|David, Peter]]|penciller= [[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, Jim]]|inker= McKenna, Mark|story= Getaways|title= [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]|volume= 4|issue= 32|date= July 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[ChrisCross]]|inker= [[Rich Perotta|Perotta, Rich]]|story= Soul Survivor|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 4|issue= 33|date= Aug. 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Javaun J. Kirby|Kirby, Javaun J.]]|inker= Kirby, Javaun J.|story= Dancing in the Dark|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 4|issue= 34|date= Sept. 2002}}</ref> The Magus then retaliates against Genis's friends and allies. The Magus wounds [[Moondragon]] and then heals her, revealing that she is destined to become his slave.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Pat Quinn (comics)|Quinn, Pat]]|inker= |story= ... Go the Spoils|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 5|issue= 24|date= Aug. 2004}}</ref>

In an effort to repair damage to [[spacetime]], Warlock "stitches" a tear with an alternate, stable timeline- the timeline where he became the Magus, causing his immediate transformation. Magus then takes control of the Universal Church of Truth and fights the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name="GotG1719" />

The Magus allies himself with [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)#Lord Mar-Vell|Lord Mar-Vell]], and is killed when he fails a mission.<ref name="Imperative1" /> The church briefly resurrected him as a child before the [[Annihilators]] imprisoned him inside his cocoon.<ref name="Earthfall4" />

===The Goddess===
The Goddess is the embodiment of Adam Warlock's goodness, created when he uses the Infinity Gauntlet to remove the quality from himself.<ref name="Gauntlet6" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Ethereal Revisionism|title= Infinity War|issue= 2|date= July 1992}}</ref> She appears as a central figure in the 1993 limited series ''[[Infinity Crusade]]''. She assembles a collection of [[cosmic cube]]s and forges them into a Cosmic Egg. Using its power, she recreates [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], dubbing it Paradise Omega.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Epiphany|title= Infinity Crusade|issue= 1|date= June 1993}}</ref> Embarking on a crusade to eliminate sin, the Goddess uses telepathy to control spiritual beings across the universe, recruiting them to her cause. When Warlock and Earth's other heroes learn she plans to destroy all sin by destroying anything capable of sin, they rally against her. She is defeated when her followers learn her true goal, and is absorbed into the soul gem.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Rapture|title= Infinity Crusade|issue= 6|date= Nov. 1993}}</ref>

===Earth X===
In the ''[[Earth X]]'' limited series, [[Mar-Vell]] is reincarnated as the child of the synthetic Adam Warlock/Him and Kismet/Her.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Krueger|Krueger, Jim]]); [[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]]|penciller= [[John Paul Leon|Leon, John Paul]]|inker= [[Bill Reinhold|Reinhold, Bill]]|story= Earth X Chapter Ten|title= [[Earth X]]|issue= 10|date= January 2000}}</ref>
