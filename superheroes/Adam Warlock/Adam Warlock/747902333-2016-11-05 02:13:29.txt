'''Adam Warlock''', originally known as '''Him''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character's earliest appearances were in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #66-67 ([[cover-date]]s Sept. 1967 and Oct. 1967) and ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #165-166 (June–July 1969). He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and significantly developed by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jim Starlin]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character has appeared in over four decades of Marvel publications, and starred in the  titles ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' and ''[[Strange Tales]]'' as well as five eponymous volumes and several related [[limited series]]. Adam Warlock has been associated with Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]], and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==

===1960s to 1970s===
The character's origin was shown in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #66 (Sept 1967) in a story written by [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciler|pencilled]] and co-plotted by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 124|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Adam Warlock was an artificial being created by scientists to be the first of an invincible army. Simply referred to as "Him' in his early appearances, Warlock later rebelled sgainst his creators in ''Fantastic Four'' #66.}}</ref> The character also appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #67 (Oct 1967) and ''Thor'' #165-166 (June–July 1969). Because his role in the ''Fantastic Four'' story was minor, sources disagree on which issue is the character's true [[first appearance]].<ref>
*''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine lists ''Fantastic Four'' #66 as the origin and ''Fantastic Four'' #67 as the first appearance. 
*''[[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]'' and [[Comics Guaranty]] list ''Fantastic Four'' #67 as a [[cameo appearance]] and ''Thor'' #165 as the first appearance.</ref> Writer and then Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] and [[penciler]] [[Gil Kane]] significantly revamped Him as the [[allegory|allegorical]] [[Messiah]] '''Adam Warlock''' in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #1 (April 1972).<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: "Roy Thomas and artist Gil Kane allowed 'Him' to meet another Lee-Kirby character, the godlike High Evolutionary."</ref>

In 2009, Thomas explained he had been a fan of the soundtrack to the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and sought to bring the story to comic books in a superhero context: "Yes, I had some trepidation about the [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] parallels, but I hoped there would be little outcry if I handled it tastefully, since I was not really making any serious statement on religion... at least not overtly."  <ref name=backissuep3>{{cite journal|last = Walker|first = Karen|title = The Life and Death (and Life and Death) of Adam Warlock|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 34|page = 3|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = June 2009|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Choosing to use a preexisting character while keeping the series locale separate from mainstream Marvel Earth, he created Counter-Earth, a new planet generated from a chunk of Earth and set in orbit on the opposite side of the sun.<ref name=backissuep4>Walker, p. 4</ref> Thomas and Kane collaborated on the costume, with the red tunic and golden lightning bolt as their homage to [[Fawcett Comics]]' 1940s-1950s character [[Captain Marvel (Fawcett Comics)|Captain Marvel]].<ref name=backissuep4 />

The story continued in the series ''The Power of Warlock'', which ran eight issues (Aug. 1972 - Oct. 1973),<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 156: "Adam Warlock received his own bimonthly comic book in August [1972], written by Roy Thomas and pencilled by Gil Kane."</ref> with some plotlines concluded in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #176-178 (June-Aug. 1974).<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 166: "Adam Warlock  rose from the dead to defeat Man-Beast and his New Men on Counter-Earth in issue #178 of ''Incredible Hulk''."</ref>

In a 2009 retrospective survey of the character, writer Karen Walker said the series
{{quote|... continued the story of Adam's attempts to drive the [fallen-angel figure the] [[Man-Beast]] out of Counter-Earth, but drifted toward standard superhero stories with pseudo-[[Biblical]] references injected into them. Warlock spends much of his time trying to convince the [[High Evolutionary]] not to destroy the planet, and the rest of his time battling the Man-Beast and his minions. Although the concept of a superhero savior was still present, it often came across as forced, and certainly contradictory to the idea of a pacifistic savior. It's questionable whether the concept could really work in a medium driven by physical conflict.<ref name=backissuep5>Walker, p. 5</ref>}}

Writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] revived Warlock in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #178-181 (Feb.-Aug. 1975).<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 168: "Adam Warlock returned in a new series, taking over ''Strange Tales'' for four issues...The original ''Warlock'' comic book would return with issue #9 in October [1975]."</ref> Warlock's adventures became more cosmic in scope as Starlin took the character through an extended storyline referred to as "The Magus Saga."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/effect/109537201997793.htm|title= Warlock: The Magus Saga|first= Jim|last= Kingman|date=September 16, 2004|publisher= Comics Bulletin|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114220900/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/effect/109537201997793.htm|archivedate=January 14, 2009 |deadurl= yes|accessdate= February 9, 2013}}</ref>

The reimagined title continued the numbering of ''The Power of Warlock'' and began with ''Warlock'' #9 (Oct. 1975) and ran seven issues. The bimonthly series was initially written and drawn by Starlin, but was eventually co-penciled and inked by [[Steve Leialoha]]. Some plot threads were concluded in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #55 (March 1977), ''Avengers Annual'' #7 (Nov. 1977) and ''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #2 (Dec. 1977).<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 97|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= The spirit of the recently deceased Adam Warlock...reduced Thanos to a statue of hardened granite.}}</ref>

Starlin, in a 2009 interview, recalled,
{{quote|I had quit [the cosmic superhero series] ''[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]'' over a dispute at that point,  but I settled the dispute with Marvel and I was going to come back [to that title]. But [a different team was in place]. So Roy [Thomas] asked me [what character] I wanted to do. So I went home that night and pulled out a bunch of comics. I came across, in the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', Him, and came back the next day and said that's who I wanted to do, and that night I started working on it... I had basically taken Captain Marvel, a warrior, and turned him into sort of a messiah-type character. So when I got to Warlock, I said to myself, 'I got a messiah right here to start off with; where do I go from there?' And I decided a [[paranoid]] [[schizophrenic]] was the route to take.<ref name=backissuep6>Walker, p. 6</ref>}}

Artist [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]] recalled in a 2006 interview there was a "lost" Adam Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the [[Jonathan Swift]] novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/warlock.htm|title= The Legendary 'Lost' ''Warlock''|first= Daniel|last= Best|year= 2007|publisher= Adelaide Comics and Books|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120319195813/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/warlock.htm|archivedate=March 19, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> Portions of it were printed in the second volume of ''[[Marvel Masterworks]]: Warlock''.

Warlock's adventures were reprinted, with new Starlin covers, in the six-issue [[limited series]] ''Special Edition Warlock'' (Dec. 1982 - May 1983).<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock.htm#S1175 ''Warlock Special Edition'' (1982-1983)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators.

Although regarded as deceased at the time, Warlock made a brief appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #63 (May 1980).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Gruenwald|Gruenwald, Mark]]|penciller= [[Jerry Bingham|Bingham, Jerry]]|inker= [[Gene Day|Day, Gene]]|story= Suffer Not a Warlock to Live!|title= [[Marvel Two-in-One]]|issue= 63|date= May 1980}}</ref>

===1990s revival===
Eleven years later, Starlin revived the character and two members of his supporting cast in the [[miniseries]] ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991).<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 254: "With the help of Dr. Strange, Warlock amassed a small army of heroes in order to confront Thanos head-on at his headquarters."</ref><ref>Cowsill, Alan "1990s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 192: "Marvel's cosmic heroes joined forces with Spider-Man, Adam Warlock, and a host of earth-based heroes to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos."</ref> This plot development was a continuation of a larger storyline that began with the resurrection of [[Thanos]] in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990).

Following the events of the ''The Infinity Gauntlet'', Warlock and several compatriots starred in the series ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch''. Initially written by Starlin and drawn by [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]], it ran 42 issues (Feb. 1992 - Aug. 1995). Its plots tied directly into the limited series ''Infinity War'' (June-Nov. 1992) and ''Infinity Crusade'' (June-Dec. 1993).

Warlock starred in several limited series, including ''Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection'' #1-4 (March–June 1993); ''The Warlock Chronicles'' #1-8 (July 1993 - Feb.1994); and ''Warlock'' vol. 3, #1-4 (Nov. 1998 - Feb. 1999), by writer-penciler [[Tom Lyle]].<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock.htm#S612 ''Warlock'' (III) (1998-1999)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref> The character was featured in the [[intercompany crossover]]s between [[Marvel Comics]] and the [[Malibu Comics]] "[[Ultraverse]]" in the [[one shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Rune / Silver Surfer'' (April 1995 in indicia, June 1995 on cover); ''[[Rune (comics)|Rune]]'' vol. 2, #1-7 (Sept. 1995 - April 1996), and the two-issue ''Ultraverse Unlimited'' (June and Sept. 1996).

Following the unrelated, 1999-2000 series ''Warlock'' vol. 4, featuring the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[cybernetic]] character [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] of the [[New Mutants]] team,<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/mtech.htm#S695 ''Warlock''(IV) (Mutant Alien) (1999-2000)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref> Adam Warlock co-starred with Thanos in the limited series ''The [[Infinity Abyss]]'' #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002); ''[[Marvel Universe: The End]]'' #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003; first four issues biweekly); and ''Thanos'' #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April 2004). A version of the character starred in the four-issue limited series ''Warlock'' vol. 5 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005), by writer [[Greg Pak]] and artist [[Charles Adlard]]. After appearances in ''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007) and ''[[Annihilation Conquest]]'' # 1-6 (Nov. 2007 - April 2008), he was a key character in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' vol. 2, #1-25 (July 2008 - April 2010), ''The Thanos Imperative'' #1 (June 2010) and the ''Ignition'' one-shot (May 2010)

During Warlock's temporary possession of the Gauntlet, he purged good and evil from his being, leaving him entirely a creature of logic.

===The Infinity Revelation===
While on a new quest, Thanos encounters Warlock's soul in Death's domain. It follows Thanos back to the living world, where it regains human form. Warlock accompanies Thanos on a journey as their universe merges with another one. Due to the convergence, Warlock is retroactively replaced by his counterpart from the other universe.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= Smith, Andy|story= The Infinity Revelation|title= Thanos: The Infinity Revelation|issue= 1|date= August 2014}}</ref>

Extremely disgruntled by the experience, the new Warlock left Thanos to ponder his situation, and he eventually ended up on "New Krall" acting as a gladiator in a fighting pit. Thanos receives a message through time/space from his omnipotent former self to seek this new Adam Warlock who is now unnaturally more powerful than before. Agreeing, Thanos first seeks [[Pip the Troll]] to teleport to New Krall and then contacts [[Gamora]] to also go to Adam, as they both are his closest friends and can keep him from doing any damage to the universe. During this time Annihilus begins a re-invasion of the Positive Zone searching for an immense power source that turns out to be Adam himself and launches a devastating siege on New Krall. The Shi'ar, led by [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] (also looking for the power source), appear and Annihilus, now with the power of the Hulk and a new fear projection ability, defeats them. Pip swiftly teleports Adam, Gamora, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and himself back to the Guardians' ship to safety and are joined by Thanos, where they discover the universe that Adam created was not destroyed, but became a part of him and has given him the power of Eternity and Infinity.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= Smith, Andy|title= Thanos: The Infinity Relativity|issue= 1|date= 2015}}</ref>

Thanos enhances Pip's abilities to teleport the ship to Annihilus' empire to stop Annihilus once and for all, but are overwhelmed by Annihilus, who teleports Thanos into limbo and takes Adam prisoner (by placing a neural disruptor on him), forcing the Guardians to retreat. Pip stays behind, stating Adam is his only friend and he will not abandon him. The comatose Adam is placed into Annihilus' ship's power source to use him as battery. Pip, after hiding on Annihilus' ship for three months, finds the comatose Adam and launches a rescue mission, killing his guards and striking Adam repeatedly to waken him. Finally awakening, Adam unconsciously destroys the universe and is left floating in a void. Panicking, Adam calls out for Thanos and wills the Titan back into existence. Thanos then proposes to Adam a plan to beseech the [[One Above All]] to recreate the universe. The One Above All agrees, on the condition Adam act as the universe's new [[Living Tribunal]]. Adam and Thanos restore the universes and immediately kill Annihilus and his fleet, ending his threat once and for all. Finally, on Thanos' request, the "new" Living Tribunal resurrects the original Adam Warlock from the point he was killed moments before the convergence took place.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Smith, Andy|title= Thanos The Infinity Finale|issue= 1|date= 2016}}</ref>

The true Adam, alive again, decides to take Thanos' advice to go back to "the existence that is his". He immediately goes to Pip the Troll, who runs to his friend with open arms, and they return to their old life of adventure.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= [[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]]|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= In the Beginning!|title= The Infinity Entity|issue= 1|date= May 2016}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Davis, Alan|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= Part Two: Overload!|title=The Infinity Entity|issue= 2|date= May 2016}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Davis, Alan|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= Part Three: Answers?|title=The Infinity Entity|issue= 3|date= May 2016}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Davis, Alan|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= Part Four: The Truth|title=The Infinity Entity|issue= 4|date= June 2016}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Him, the character possessed superhuman strength; speed; durability; stamina; agility and the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for energy projection, flight and recuperation (e.g., creating a cocoon for self-preservation and regeneration). However, Him sacrificed the majority of these powers by prematurely emerging from his cocoon in order to defend the High Evolutionary from an assault by the Man-Beast. In compensation, the High Evolutionary gave Him the Soul Gem.<ref name="Premiere" /> The Gem possesses a consciousness of its own and demonstrates a vampiric hunger for the life energies of organic beings. It contains an idyllic [[pocket universe]] that hosts all the souls the Gem has ever taken. The latest version of Warlock uses "Quantum magic" and can manipulate energy; create force fields; teleport; travel faster than light and detect or produce [[wormholes]] and other irregularities in space on a cosmic scale.

He has the power to devolve the followers of Man-Beast into the animals from which they evolved,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy; [[Mike Friedrich|Friedrich, Mike]]|penciller= Kane, Gil; [[John Buscema|Buscema, John]]; [[Tom Sutton|Sutton, Tom]]|inker= Sutton, Tom|story= Count-Down For Counter-Earth|title= Warlock|issue= 2|date= Oct. 1972}}</ref> as well as revert the [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Brute]] into Counter-Earth Reed Richards.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy; [[Ron Goulart|Goulart, Ron]]; Friedrich, Mike|penciller= [[Bob Brown (comics)|Brown, Bob]]|inker= Sutton, Tom|story= The Brute|title= Warlock|issue= 6|date= June 1973}}</ref> This power comes from his soul gem.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Friedrich, Mike|penciller= Brown, Bob|inker= Sutton, Tom|story= Confrontation|title= Warlock|issue= 8|date= Oct. 1973}}</ref>

===The Magus===
[[Image:Themagusoriginal.png|thumb|The Magus, from ''Strange Tales'' #181 (Aug. 1975). Art by Jim Starlin.]]
There have been three incarnations of the Magus.

The original Magus is an older, evil Adam Warlock who has traveled to the past and rules a religious empire called the Universal Church of Truth. To ensure his own creation, he guides his younger self through a series of actions that will result in him becoming the Magus.<ref name="ST178" /><ref name="ST179" /><ref name="ST180" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Starlin, Jim|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= 1000 Clowns!|title= Strange Tales|issue= 181|date= Aug. 1975}}</ref> With the aid of Thanos, Warlock alters his future and destroys the Magus's timeline, erasing him from existence.<ref name="Warlock11" />

When Warlock acquires the Infinity Gauntlet,<ref name="Gauntlet6" /> he expels good and evil from his soul, unintentionally giving them corporeal forms. The evil half names himself the Magus and attempts to gain the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. He fails, and Warlock traps him in the Soul Gem. Since he is only part of a soul, he cannot interact with the other inhabitants of Soul World and exists only as a phantom.<ref name="InfinityWar" /> The Magus escapes the Soul Gem in an immaterial form, absorbing the life energies of others to regain tangibility. He is defeated by [[Genis-Vell]] and reverts to an ethereal entity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Peter David|David, Peter]]|penciller= [[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, Jim]]|inker= McKenna, Mark|story= Getaways|title= [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]|volume= 4|issue= 32|date= July 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[ChrisCross]]|inker= [[Rich Perotta|Perotta, Rich]]|story= Soul Survivor|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 4|issue= 33|date= Aug. 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Javaun J.

Go the Spoils|title= Captain Marvel|volume= 5|issue= 24|date= Aug. 2004}}</ref>

Warlock becomes the third Magus when he repairs a damage to the spacetime continuum. This Magus works for the evil [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)#Lord Mar-Vell|Lord Mar-Vell]], and is killed when he fails a mission.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Walker, Brad|inker= Hennessy, Andrew|story= Ignition|title= Thanos Imperative: Ignition|issue= 1|date= July 2010}}</ref> The Universal Church of Truth resurrects him as a child,<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Huat, Tan Eng|inker= Hennessy, Andrew|title= Annihilators: Earthfall|issue= 1|date= November 2011}}</ref> who is then imprisoned by the Annihilators.<ref name="Earthfall4" />

===The Goddess===
The Goddess is the embodiment of Adam Warlock's goodness, created when he uses the Infinity Gauntlet to remove the quality from himself.<ref name="Gauntlet6" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Starlin, Jim|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Ethereal Revisionism|title= Infinity War|issue= 2|date= July 1992}}</ref> She appears as a central figure in the 1993 limited series ''Infinity Crusade''.

===Earth X===
In the ''[[Earth X]]'' limited series, [[Mar-Vell]] is reincarnated as the child of the synthetic Adam Warlock/Him and [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet/Her]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Krueger|Krueger, Jim]]); [[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]]|penciller= [[John Paul Leon|Leon, John Paul]]|inker= [[Bill Reinhold|Reinhold, Bill]]|story= Earth X Chapter Ten|title= [[Earth X]]|issue= 10|date= January 2000}}</ref>
