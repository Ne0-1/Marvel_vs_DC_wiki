==Overview==

'''Adam Warlock''' is a [[fictional character]] who is published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Although the character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], his most prominent appearances were written and (in some cases) [[illustration|illustrated]] by [[Jim Starlin]].  He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #66 ([[1967]]).

==Character History==

Warlock is an artificially-created human who was "born" in a cocoon at a scientific complex called "The Beehive". The goal of his creators, the Enclave, was to create and subsequently exploit the perfect human. While in the cocoon, he became aware of his creators' plans for him. He awoke from the cocoon and rebelled. Having not had a childhood or parents, Warlock was lacking in maturity and restraint. (At this point, he was also lacking a name; for his first several appearances, Warlock simply went by "Him".) Warlock came into conflict with the Fantastic Four and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]; during his encounter with the latter, he was killed when he attempted to force Thor's sometime paramour [[Sif]] to become his mate.

Warlock was revived and his behavior improved when he met the being known as the [[High Evolutionary]]. Under his guidance, Warlock's life was given direction and purpose, though to this day he remains arrogant and aloof. Warlock also came into possession of the Soul Gem at this point. The Soul Gem, one of the [[Infinity Gems]], allowed Warlock to sense the [[soul]]s of others and draw them into a dimension contained within the gem.

Warlock was then transported to Counter-Earth, an attempt by the [[High Evolutionary]] to create a utopian society out of the framework of the original Earth. Unfortunately, it had fallen under the influence of the nefarious [[Man-Beast]], a [[wolf]] that had been genetically modified into humanoid form by the [[High Evolutionary]]. In the process of ending the Man-Beast's regime, Warlock's narcissism led him to another death, this time by crucifixion. He was, again, revived later.

Shortly, Warlock came into conflict with the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], a future incarnation of Warlock himself and leader of the Universal Church of Truth, a quasi-religious militia which conquered and ruled a thousand worlds with an iron fist. Warlock travelled through time to the moment when he would become the Magus and stole his future self's soul, retroactively preventing him from ever existing.

Subsequently Warlock died once more, battling the mad [[Titans (comics)|Titan]] [[Thanos]].

Warlock's [[soul]] resided in the Soul Gem for several years, until Thanos was restored to life by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death itself]]. Thanos, having obtained the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] (a glove bearing all of the Infinity Gems) and become [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], exiled the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Drax the Destroyer]] to the world within the Soul Gem. After sending the pair back to their physical bodies, Warlock's soul left the Soul Gem and inhabited a recently-deceased corpse, which metamorphosed into Warlock's new body. Warlock was instrumental in Thanos' defeat here as well, and in the end obtained the Infinity Gauntlet for himself.

Warlock was soon forced to separate the Infinity Gems among separate bearers, the cosmic powers of the universe having prevented the Gems from functioning as one after Thanos' gross misuse of their power. Warlock kept the Soul Gem for himself, and split the rest of the gems among the members of the [[Infinity Watch]]. Warlock's temporary possession of the Gauntlet had had unforeseen consequences; in attempting to control his emotions to better wield the Gauntlet, he had purged all good and evil from his soul. As a result, these aspects took on physical form: the evil half became a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half became the self-styled Goddess. Both attempted to gain control over the universe, and both were thwarted and exiled to the world of the Soul Gem, where they had no substance and (Warlock assumed) would pose no threat to anyone.

Some months later, Warlock was killed (again) by the alien vampire called [[Rune (comics)|Rune]]; the Infinity Watch disbanded and the Gems disappeared into a parallel universe, the "[[Ultraverse]]", where Warlock found himself reborn. Warlock eventually returned to the [[Marvel Universe]], and encountered Thanos and the former members of the Infinity Watch a number of times more.  He received a miniseries shortly thereafter, in which he fought the reanimated corpse of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]].

Warlock's next major appearance was in the Infinity Abyss mini-series.  Warlock was found to be living in an intergalatic Insane Asylum, encased in another self-generated cocoon.  Warlock was reincarnated with a slight different appearance after a clone of Thanos asked Moondragon to revive him.  Warlock assisted in preventing a universal crisis against Thanos' clones, and ended up watching over Atleza, a being posed to keep the cosmos from falling into the Infinity Abyss.  He also engaged in a relationship with Gamora.  Later, Warlock, being outside the cosmos then was able to convice Thanos to restore the Marvel Universe after he destroyed it after receiving ultimate power, assisted Thanos in his first reformed quest, and most recently assisted [[She-Hulk]].

In 2004, Marvel Comics has released a second Warlock series written by Greg Pak, which is apparently a second artificial being--a second version of "Him"--created by the Enclave in the Marvel Universe.

==Author/Publisher Background==

Although the character was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, comic fans tend to consider the definitive Adam Warlock saga to be the issues of the series Jim Starlin had authored and illustrated in the 1970's.  Starlin's Warlock became a series heavilly influenced by its creator.  Scott McCloud had placed a panel in his Reinventing Comics book as one of the series that got him interested in comics during his high school years.

It should be noted that the "Starlin Issues" have been reprinted several times by Marvel Comics, while other issues of the Warlock book (The Counter-Earth saga) have to this date not been reprinted.
