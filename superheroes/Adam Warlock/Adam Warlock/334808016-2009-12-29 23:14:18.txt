'''Adam Warlock''', originally known as '''Him''', is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #66 (Sept. 1967) (in [[cocoon]] form) and #67 (Oct. 1967), (in humanoid form) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character has appeared in over four decades of Marvel publications, and starred in the popular titles ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' and ''[[Strange Tales]]''; five self-titled volumes and several related [[limited series]]. Adam Warlock has also been associated with Marvel merchandise including [[clothing]]; [[toy]]s; [[trading cards]]; [[animated]] [[television series]] and [[video game]]s.  

==Publication history==
The character debuted in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #66-67 (Sept.-Oct. 1967) in a story written by [[Stan Lee]] and [[penciler|pencilled]] and co-plotted by [[Jack Kirby]]. Established as an artificial human called '''Him''', the character was created for personal gain and power by the scientific group the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]]. The [[superhero]] team the [[Fantastic Four]], rescuing their friend [[Alicia Masters]] from the Enclave's island base, escape together when Him "hatches" from his [[cocoon]] and destroys the island. Him abandons his masters and departs Earth for space. 

After a final appearance as "Him" in ''Thor'' #165-166 (June-July 1969), writer [[Roy Thomas]] and [[penciler]] [[Gil Kane]] significantly revamped Him as the [[allegory|allegorical]] [[Messiah]] '''Adam Warlock''' in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #1 (April 1972). The [[High Evolutionary]], a master of [[genetics]], evolved Him to a more advanced state of being and rechristened the character "Adam Warlock" in ''Marvel Premiere'' #2 (May 1972). The story continued in the series ''The Power of Warlock'', which ran eight issues (Aug. 1972 - Oct. 1973), with Warlock also making an appearance in ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #158 (Dec. 1972).

After this storyline is resolved in ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #176-178 (June-Aug. 1974), writer-artist [[Jim Starlin]] revived Warlock in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #178-181 (Feb.-Aug. 1975). Warlock's adventures became more cosmic in scope as Starlin took the character through an extended storyline referred to as "The Magus Saga",<ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/effect/109537201997793.htm Silver Bullet Comics (Sept. 16, 2004): "Comic Effect" (column by Jim Kingman): "The Magus Saga"]</ref> which continued in ''Warlock'' #9 (Oct. 1975), the reimagined title continuing the numbering of ''The Power of Warlock''. This bimonthly series, written and drawn by Starlin, who was eventually assisted by co-penciler and [[inker]] [[Steve Leialoha]], ran seven issues. It chronicled Warlock's conflict with his future [[demagogue]] self, the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], and his religious empire, culminating in issue #12. A final story arc dealt with Warlock's battle with the entity the [[Star Thief]] before this series was canceled with issue #15 (Nov. 1976).

Warlock's adventures were reprinted, with new Starlin covers, in the six-issue [[limited series]] ''Special Edition on Warlock'' (Dec. 1982 - May 1983).<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock.htm#S1175 ''Special Edition on Warlock'' (1982-1983)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''. Note: The [[Grand Comic-Book Database]] uses the title ''Warlock'' ([http://www.comics.org/series/2670/ ''Warlock'' Marvel, 1982 Series]), which is at odds with subsequent UHMCC volume numbers.</ref> This reprint series was itself reprinted, with yet another set of new Starlin covers, as ''Warlock'' vol. 2 (May-Oct. 1992).<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock2.htm#S239 ''Warlock'' (II) (1992)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''</ref>

Warlock then made three connected appearances: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #55 (March 1977) with hero [[Spider-Man]]; and the first "[[Thanos]] War" in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Annual #7 (1977) and ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' Annual #2 (1977). The last story featured Warlock's death and brief resurrection and return from the world of the [[Soul Gem]], before disappearing from Marvel continuity. Although regarded as deceased, Warlock makes a brief appearance in a storyline in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #61 - 63 (March - May 1980), albeit as a soulless inanimate shell. 

Eleven years later Starlin revived the character, together with two members of his supporting cast in the limited series ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991). This plot development was a continuation of a larger storyline that began with the resurrection of Thanos in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990). 

Following the events of the ''The Infinity Gauntlet'' (July-Dec. 1991), Warlock and several compatriots starred in the series ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch''. Written by Starlin and drawn initially by [[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]], it ran 42 issues (Feb. 1992 - Aug. 1995). Many of the early storylines continued to focus on the [[Infinity Gems]] and the consequences of their use in the Marvel Universe, with plots tying into two related limited series, ''The Infinity War'' (June-Nov. 1992) and ''The Infinity Crusade'' (June-Dec. 1993).

Warlock starred in several limited series, including ''Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection'' #1-4 (March-June 1993); ''The Warlock Chronicles'' #1-8 (July 1993 - Feb. 1994); and ''Warlock'' vol. 3, #1-4 (Nov. 1998 - Feb. 1999), by writer-penciler [[Tom Lyle]].<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/warlock.htm#S612 ''Warlock'' (III) (1998-1999)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''</ref> The character also featured in the [[intercompany crossover]]s between [[Marvel Comics]] and the [[Malibu Comics]] ''[[Ultraverse]]'' in the [[one shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Rune / Silver Surfer'' (April 1995 in indicia, June 1995 on cover); ''[[Rune (comics)|Rune]]'' vol. 2, #1-7 (Sept. 1995 - April 1996); and the two-issue ''Ultraverse Unlimited'' (June & Sept. 1996).

Following the unrelated, 1999-2000 series ''Warlock'' vol. 4, featuring the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[cybernetic]] character [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] of the team the [[New Mutants]],<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/mtech.htm#S695 ''Warlock''(IV) (Mutant Alien) (1999-2000)] at ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators''</ref> Adam Warlock co-starred with Thanos in the limited series ''The [[Infinity Abyss]]'' #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002; published biweekly); ''[[Marvel Universe: The End]]'' #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003; first four issues biweekly); and ''Thanos'' #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April 2004; two issues biweekly). A version of the character starred in the four-issue limited series ''Warlock'' vol. 5 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005), by writer [[Greg Pak]] and artist [[Charles Adlard]]. Warlock undergoes changes in the miniseries ''[[Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007), and is featured in the subsequent ''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007) and ''[[Annihilation Conquest]]'' # 1-6 (Nov. 2007 - April 2008) before joining the titular heroic team in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' vol. 2, #1 (July 2008). A storyline in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #17-19 (Oct.-Dec. 2009) has Warlock adopting the alias of the Magus, and eventually being killed by a Guardians team-mate.

Artist [[Alan Weiss]] recalled in a 2006 interview there was a "lost" Adam Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the [[Jonathan Swift]] novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref>Best, Daniel [http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/warlock.htm "The Legendary 'Lost' Warlock"] Adelaide Comics and Books, 2007</ref>

== Biography ==
===Creation, Metamorphosis and Death===
After his birth and escape from the Enclave and Earth, Him is revealed to have been caught in an [[asteroid]] shower and saved by [[cosmic entity]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], who sends the artificial being back to Earth. Discovering the Asgardian [[goddess]] [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], Him decides to take her as his mate, which incites the fury of the Norse god and [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Him subsequently escapes Thor by creating another cocoon around himself.<ref>''Thor'' #165-166 (June-July 1969)</ref>

Found by the [[High Evolutionary]], the entity is evolved to a higher state of being and rechristens him "Adam Warlock": "Adam", for being the first of his kind, and "Warlock", because humanity would fear his power. The High Evolutionary also bestows on Warlock the green [[Soul Gem]] (eventually revealed to be one of the six [[Infinity Gems]]), a gem with the power to suck the [[soul]]s from opponents. Warlock's mission is to stop the High Evolutionary's flawed creation, the [[Man Beast]], on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the High Evolutionary's copy of the original Earth. A protracted war ensues,<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #1 - 2 (April & May 1972); ''The Power of Warlock'' #1 - 8 (Aug. 1972 - Oct. 1973)</ref> with the monster the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] aiding Warlock on two separate visits to Counter-Earth. Although the Man-Beast captures and tortures a [[crucified]] Warlock, he is reborn and reverts the Man-Beast back into wolf form. With the chaos on Counter-Earth at an end, Warlock departs for space.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #158 (Dec. 1972)</ref><ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #176-178 (June-Aug. 1974)</ref> 

In another galaxy, Warlock learns of the [[Universal Church of Truth]], an intergalactic religious empire presided over by a mysterious figure known as the Magus.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #178 (Feb. 1975)</ref> Eventually meeting and befriending the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Pip the Troll]]<ref>''Strange Tales'' #179 (Apr. 1975)</ref> and female assassin [[Gamora]],<ref>''Strange Tales'' #180 (June 1975)</ref> Warlock opposes the Church, despite opposition from the Church's [[Matriarch]] and soldier-priests the Black Knights.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #181 (Aug. 1975)</ref> The [[Machiavellian]] alien [[Thanos]], Gamora's employer, appears and claims he will aid Warlock to stop the Magus. Warlock, unaware of Thanos' attempt to rule the universe with the reality-changing [[Cosmic Cube]],<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #25-33 (bimonthly: March 1972-July 1974)</ref> accepts. 

During his first encounter with the Magus, Warlock discovers the entity is in fact his futuristic evil [[alter ego]], who tells Warlock his constant use of the Soul Gem brings him closer to being the Magus.<ref>''Warlock'' #9 (Oct. 1975)</ref> Thanos engages the Magus in personal combat while Warlock encounters the [[cosmic entity]] the [[In-Betweener]], who has been sent to esnure that Warlock becomes the Magus.<ref>''Warlock'' #10 (Dec. 1975)</ref> Warlock, however, succeeds in altering his personal timeline by killing a version of himself that exists a few months into the future. Knowing that he will in turn die, Warlock prevents the Magus from ever existing.<ref>''Warlock'' #11 (Feb. 1976)</ref> Warlock also encounters the villain the Star Thief, a [[coma]]tose and human hospital patient whose [[subconscious]] is capable of destroying entire stars.<ref>''Warlock'' #13 - 14 (June & Aug. 1976)</ref> 

Denied a homecoming to Earth after a protracted battle with the Star Thief, Warlock struggles to control the [[vampiric]] Soul Gem.<ref>''Warlock'' #15 (Nov. 1976)</ref> After rescuing the hero [[Spider-Man]] from a rocket in space, the pair thwart the cosmic entity the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], who attempts to steal the Soul Gem. The heroes also discover the existence of the other gems.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #55 (March 1977)</ref> 

Warlock returns to Thanos' vessel to find Gamora dying and Pip's mind destroyed by Thanos. The Eternal has secretly collected the five other gems and been draining the energies of the Soul Gem without Warlock's knowledge, using the power from all six artifacts for a weapon capable of destroying a [[star]]. Thanos, still pining for the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] - who abandoned him after his previous failure - intends to extinguish every star in the universe as an offering to the entity. Warlock travels to Earth and enlists the aid of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; the [[Kree]] hero [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]; and heroine [[Moondragon (comics)|Moondragon]]. After an exhaustive battle between Warlock's allies and Thanos' mercenary fleet, Thanos mortally wounds Warlock. Captain Marvel witnesses Warlock's soul being taken by his temporally displaced previous self, a feat Warlock had arranged in the past to stop the Magus from existing. Avengers Thor and [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] force Thanos to retreat, but with Captain Marvel are eventually defeated. The cosmic entities [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]] intervene, and via a subconscious message draw Spider-Man and [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] into the battle. Spider-Man frees the fallen heroes, and then makes contact with the Soul Gem, releasing the spirit of Warlock. A newly empowered Warlock turns Thanos to stone before returning to the Soul Gem, finally ending the threat.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #7 (Nov. 1977) and ''Marvel Two-In-One Annual'' #2 (1977)</ref> 

Fellow Enclave creation [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Her]] becomes intent on finding Warlock, as she was created to be his mate. Aided by the Thing; Moondragon and [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] member [[Starhawk]], Her locates Warlock's corpse, but abandons any hope of Warlock being her mate, as his mind and soul are gone.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #61 - 63 (March - May 1980)</ref>

=== Rebirth ===
Believing the balance in the universe is too heavily in favour of life, Death resurrects Thanos,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990)</ref> who decides to win "her" favour" by performing a cosmic feat. The Eternal finds and humbles the [[Elders of the Universe]] (killing the Elder the [[Gardener (comics)|Gardener]]) and the entity the [[In-Betweener]], taking from them the Infinity Gems.<ref>''The Thanos Quest'' #1-2 (Sept.-Oct. 1990)</ref> Taking the Soul Gem inadvertently revives Adam Warlock, who senses Thanos' rebirth. Warlock also brings to souls of Pip and Gamora, and they are able to re-enter the material world by assuming control of three recently deceased humans.

Thanos uses the Gems, which he mounts on his left glove as the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], to erase half the population of the universe. After Thanos defeats a cosmic hierarchy that includes [[Galactus]]; the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], Warlock leads a group of Earth's surviving superheroes against him. The space [[pirate]] [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] steals the Gauntlet, but after undoing all of Thanos' changes loses the Gauntlet to Warlock.<ref name=gauntlet>''The Infinity Gauntlet'' #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991)</ref> Warlock, however, is deemed unworthy of the Gauntlet by the entity the [[Living Tribunal]] as he is an artificial being. Warlock concedes and divides the Infinity Gems among himself and his companions — Pip; Gamora; [[Drax the Destroyer]]; Moondragon; and a reformed Thanos — the group being called the [[Infinity Watch]].<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #1-42 (Feb. 1992 - Aug. 1995)</ref>

Warlock's temporary possession of the Gauntlet has unforeseen consequences: in attempting to control his emotions, the character purges all good and evil from his being, leaving him entirely as a creature of logic.  The "moral" aspects of his persona in turn take on physical forms — the evil half becomes a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half becomes the self-styled [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]]. Warlock, aided by an army of superheroes, eventually defeats each in turn, and absorbs them into the Soul Gem.<ref>''The Infinity War'' #1-6 (June-Nov. 1992)</ref><ref>''The Infinity Crusade'' #1-6 (June-Dec. 1993)</ref> 

Warlock and a multitude of superheroes also team with Thanos to defeat several rogue [[cloning|clone]]s of the Eternal,<ref>''The Infinity Abyss'' #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002; published biweekly)</ref> and Warlock eventually convinces Thanos to destroy and recreate the universe to fix a fundamental flaw.<ref>''Marvel Universe: The End'' #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003; first four issues biweekly)</ref> Warlock also assists in Thanos' attempt at redeeming himself.<ref>''Thanos'' #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April 2004; two issues biweekly)</ref>

=== Annihilation and the Guardians ===
[[Image:Guardians-17.jpg|thumb|The modern version of ''Adam Warlock'' featured on the cover of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' vol. 2, #17 (Oct. 2009). Art by [[Mike Perkins]].]]
Warlock is incapacitated by the backlash of souls killed during the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" storyline, and re-enters hibernation in a cocoon.<ref>''Annihilation'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007)</ref> The superheroines [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]] and [[Moondragon]] awaken Warlock as he is to be the prophesied "Savior of the Kree" who will deliver them from the fellow alien race the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Quasar'' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007)</ref>  Warlock, however, is disoriented due to being awakened prematurely and also now wears a costume reminiscent of the Magus. The leader of the Phalanx possesses Adam Warlock, but is eventually driven from his body by the cybernetic [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] of the [[New Mutants]]. Adam Warlock's soul, stored in Quasar's [[quantum bands]], is then returned to his body. Once the Phalanx is defeated, Warlock agrees to join the hero [[Star Lord]] in forming a team to deal with galactic threats.<ref>''Annihilation Conquest'' # 1-6 (Nov. 2007 - April 2008)</ref> They form a new version of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #1 (July 2008)</ref> 

When Warlock is forced to merge two realities to restore the universe, altering the timeline forces the Magus persona on him. As the Magus, Warlock slaughters many of the Guardians and reveals that due to the change in the timeline he has been the Magus for several months.  Star Lord temporarily suppresses Warlock with the [[Cosmic Cube]]; and while in control of himself Warlock begs Star Lord to execute him, which Star Lord does.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #17-19 (Oct.-Dec. 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Him, the character possessed superhuman strength; speed; durability; stamina; agility and the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for energy projection, flight and recuperation (e.g. creating a cocoon for self-preservation and regeneration). Once Him became Warlock and acquired the green Soul Gem, the character no longer used many of the cosmic abilities. The Gem possesses a consciousness of its own and demonstrates a vampiric hunger for the life energies of organic beings. It also contains an idyllic [[pocket universe]] that hosts all the souls the Gem has ever taken. The latest version of Warlock uses "Quantum magic" and can manipulate energy; create force fields; teleport; travel faster than light and detect [[wormholes]] and other irregularities in space.

==In other media==
Adam Warlock appears in the [[video game]] ''[[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems]]''. A version of the character appeared in the first season of the [[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer TV series]] (1994). Adam Warlock has also appeared as part of Marvel's [[OverPower]] [[collectible card game]], Upper Deck's Marvel [[Vs.]] [[collectible card game]] and [[HeroClix]] [[collectible miniatures game]], and as a [[Marvel Legends]] action figure .
