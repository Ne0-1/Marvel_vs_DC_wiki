The '''Demolition Team''' are a team of [[comic book]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. They first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #176 (May 1984) and were created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Gibbons]].

==History==
In their initial appearance, the Demolition Team were hired by [[Congressman]] Jason Bloch to destroy the [[Los Angeles]] branch of Ferris Aircraft. The Ferris employees were virtually defenseless against the team and their state-of-the-art weaponry provided by the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]. Help finally arrived in the form of the mysterious [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Predator]] who defeated the entire team unaided. It is assumed the Demolition Team were sent to [[prison]] soon after the incident.

===Current Status===
The Demolition Team returned several years later with updated technology only to be handily defeated by the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] after attacking a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Germany]]. Most of the team met their end at the hands of the [[OMACs]] during the events of ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', but Hardhat was seen alive in [[Infinite Crisis]] #7.

==Members==
*'''Hardhat''' - former heavyweight [[boxing]] [[palooka]] from [[New York City]]. His powered helmet and harness made him into a human [[juggernaut]].
*'''Jackhammer''' - former [[oil rig]] worker from [[Houston]]. He carried a larger, more powerful version of a [[jackhammer]] capable of untold destruction.
*'''Rosie''' - leader of the Demolition Team. A former, no-nonsense bar owner in [[New Orleans]], she brandished a rapid-fire hot [[rivet]] gun.
*'''Scoopshovel''' - former professional [[jai-alai]] player from [[San Diego]]. His [[hydraulic]] power-arm allowed him to dig up almost anything.
*'''Steamroller''' - a former [[motorcycle]] stunt rider from [[Chicago]]. He rode a compact version of a [[steamroller]] that could flatten buildings.
