The '''Demolition Team''' are [[fictional character]]s, a team of [[comic book]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. They first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #176 (May 1984) and were created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Gibbons]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Demolition Team | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 98  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

==Fictional character history==
In their initial appearance, the Demolition Team were hired by [[Congressman]] Jason Bloch to destroy the [[Los Angeles]] branch of Ferris Aircraft. The Ferris employees were virtually defenseless against the team and their state-of-the-art weaponry provided by the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]. Help finally arrived in the form of the mysterious [[Carol Ferris|Predator]] who defeated the entire team unaided.<ref name="dc-ency"/> It is assumed the Demolition Team were sent to [[prison]] soon after the incident.

The Demolition Team returned several years later with updated technology only to be handily defeated by the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] after attacking a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Germany]]. Hardhat later appeared committing crimes in [[Opal City]].

Rosie, together with several other scientific geniuses and cybernetic beings ([[Automan (comics)|Automan]], [[Brainstorm (comics)|Brainstorm]], [[Doctor Cyber]], [[Ford (comics)|Ford]], and [[Emil Hamilton]]), was for a brief period part of the composite cybernetic being known as [[Enginehead (comics)|Enginehead]]. However (if this story is still canon), the being seems to have been divided into the individual personalities again shortly after the events of the series ''Enginehead'' 1&ndash;6 (2004).

Most of the team met their end at the hands of the [[OMACs]] during the events of ''[[The OMAC Project]]'', but Hardhat was seen alive in [[Infinite Crisis]] #7.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Members==
*'''Hardhat''' - former heavyweight [[boxing]] palooka from [[New York City]]. His powered helmet and harness made him into a human [[juggernaut]], currently a resident of [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].
*'''Jackhammer''' - former [[Oil platform|oil rig]] worker from [[Houston]]. He carried a larger, more powerful version of a [[jackhammer]] capable of untold destruction. He is not to be confused with a similarly-named character who employed an armor suit with two hydraulically charged hammer pistons against Superman while he had been weakened by [[Blaze and Satanus|Lord Satanus]] and Syren for a time.
*'''Rosie''' - leader of the Demolition Team. A former, no-nonsense bar owner in [[New Orleans]], she brandished a rapid-fire hot [[rivet]] gun.
*'''Scoopshovel''' - former professional [[jai-alai]] player from [[San Diego]]. His [[hydraulic]] power-arm allowed him to dig up almost anything.
*'''Steamroller''' - a former [[motorcycle]] stunt rider from [[Chicago]]. He rode a compact version of a [[steamroller]] that could flatten buildings.
