'''Iron Cross''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Iron Cross was a German champion of World War II who wore armor created by Professor Franz Schneider that gave him superhuman strength and flying ability.  He could project electrical charges, sleeping gas, or an octupus-like black fluid from his armor.

Although he appeared to have been killed during a confrontation with the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and [[Liberty Legion]]<ref>Invaders #37</ref>, in reality he survived.  After the war, he joined the [[V-Battalion]], and was a founder of the Penance Council.  He has lived for over 100 years, kept alive by his armor.  He apparently died when he overloaded his armor in a successful effort to disrupt [[HYDRA]]'s attempt to use VMP and nanotech to take over the world.
