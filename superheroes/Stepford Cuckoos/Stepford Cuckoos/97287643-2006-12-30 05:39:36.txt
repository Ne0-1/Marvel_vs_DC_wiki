The '''Stepford Cuckoos''' are a group of [[fictional character|fictional]] mutant psychically-linked [[quintuplets]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], students at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. Known properly as '''Celeste''', '''Esme''', '''Mindee''', '''Phoebe''', and '''Sophie Cuckoo'''; their names, when placed in alphabetical order, also denote their respective ages-- with Celeste being the first "born" and Sophie being the youngest.  

Originally calling themselves the '''Five-in-One''', with the deaths of Esme and Sophie the remaining sisters are now known as the '''Three-in-One'''.

First appearing in ''[[New X-Men]]'' (volume 1) #118, they were created by [[Grant Morrison]]. Their origin, as the cloned "daughters" of [[Emma Frost]], is revealed in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]''

==Fictional character histories==
===Origins===
As revealed in the first issue of ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|Phoenix: Warsong]]'' the sisters are grown from ova cells harvested from [[Emma Frost]] while she lay comatose after the Sentinel attack that killed her students, the original Hellions and be only five of many of such cloned daughters.  The remaining hundreds (if not thousands) of Cuckoo sisters reside within incubation chambers inside a hidden underground laboratory at ''The World'', the complex where the latest [[Weapon Plus]] living weapons: [[Huntsman (comics)|Huntsman]], [[Fantomex]] and [[Ultimaton]], were created. They were planned to be powerful weapons able to kill every mutant by concentrating on their signatures.

[[Image:TeenStepfordCuckoos.jpg|left|thumb|The Five-in-One]]They were first introduced as the protégés and favorites of [[Emma Frost]] and along with [[Quentin Quire]], were noted as the strongest [[telepath]]s among the fourth-generation students at the [[Xavier Institute of Higher Learning]].  It is still unknown though how they ended up being at the Institute in the first place and why they didn't remember being weapons. Although Quire and the Stepford Cuckoos were rivals, Quire had a crush on Sophie. Sophie and the other Cuckoos considered him to be disgusting and rejected him completely.

Partly as an expression of adolescent rebellion, partly under the influence of the drug Kick, and partly out of a desire to impress Sophie, Quire incited a riot at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. Sophie died stopping Quire in ''New X-Men'' #137 (April 2003), having used the drug Kick to boost her powers. The Stepford Cuckoos held Frost to be partially responsible for Sophie's death and disassociated themselves from Frost at that time. With the death of Sophie, the Five-in-One became the Four-in-One.




===Corsairs and becoming the Phoenix===
Soon afterwards, the Institute was rebuilt, with Emma Frost and [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] as headmasters and leaders of the [[X-Men]]. Frost and Summers divided the older students into several six-person training squads, each taught by a staff member. The remaining three Cuckoos, now calling themselves the '''Three-in-One''', were assigned to the [[Corsairs]] squad, led by Frost's boyfriend Cyclops. The three girls were the co-leaders of the squad.

In ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong|X-Men: Phoenix Endsong]]'' (March-June 2005), the [[Phoenix Force]] came back to earth seeking the body of Jean Grey. Kid Omega, still in love with Sophie, sensed the Phoenix and [[exhumation|exhumed]] Sophie's body. Kid Omega sought the Phoenix, which resurrected Sophie, but she promptly chose to die again once she realized why Kid Omega had wanted to resurrect her. Following the return of the Phoenix to the White Hot Room, a shard of it in firefly form flew to one of the Cuckoos, who replied, "What took you so long?" It has  been revealed that this Cuckoo was Celeste, and that she now wields the Phoenix force.

In the wake of [[House of M]], in which the vast majority of the world's mutant population was depowered, the Cuckoos retained their powers. With few students left, the squad system was dissolved and Emma Frost placed the remaining students into an all-out brawl to determine who would be part of an in-training X-Men team. The Cuckoos, still resentful of Emma, refused to participate. Instead, they ran to Cyclops and informed him of Frost's plan, of which he was unaware. They still reside at the Xavier Institute.

===Weapon Plus & Phoenix - Warsong===

In ''New X-Men'' #154 (May 2004), [[Grant Morrison]]'s last issue of ''New X-Men'', the Stepford Cuckoos are identified as Weapon XIV (each girl being units 1 to 5, ordered alphabetically by their first names), the living weapon code between Weapon XIII ([[Fantomex]]) and Weapon XV ([[Ultimaton]]).

[[Image:Warsong3.PNG|Cover to ''Phoenix: Warsong #3, by [[Marc Silvestri]].|150px|thumb]]
Manipulated by both the Phoenix and Sublime, the Cuckoos awoke their dead sisters and travelled to the "[[Weapon Plus#The World|World]]". a pocket of space/time created by [[Weapon Plus]]. During the sisters' visit to "The World," they were greeted by a computer image of [[John Sublime]]. It is revealed that the Phoenix fragment has manifested in order to destroy the Cuckoos and all of their clones to prevent them from being activated as a weapon and kill al mutants - Sophie and Esme being the first such casualties of its purge.  Emma, Mindee, and Phoebe were successful in stunting Celeste's linkage with the Phoenix; only to be ambushed by Sublime's machinery, which absorbed the cosmic fragment and distributes it among each of the cloned telepaths.

==Powers==
The Cuckoos are a [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[hive mind]].  Each powerful telepaths individually, their combined power is even greater than the sum of its parts.  Though they most often function and act as one unit, they are indeed capable of thinking and operating individually.

When all five sisters were alive, Sophie was the dominant consciousness and often commanded the Cuckoos. However, as implied by Esme's actions, it is possible for another one of the Cuckoos to wrest control of the [[gestalt]] and perhaps even use the powers of all sisters without the consent and knowledge of the others. With the loss of Sophie and Esme, The Cuckoos are not as strong as they were with five.<ref>X-men #142</ref>

The power level of the Cuckoos, in all of their incarnations, have been reported by many of the staff at Xavier's School to be extremely impressive and strong; these staff members include: [[Professor X]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Emma Frost]], and [[Henry McCoy]].

==Similarities between Emma and the Cuckoos==
[[Image:SCE.png|left|thumb|Stepford Cuckoos and Emma Frost]]
One of the more noticeable characteristics of the Cuckoos was their similarity to Emma Frost, which led them to be called "mini-Emmas" in the comics themselves. The Cuckoos also have a physical resemblance to Emma, though Emma's hair is not truly blonde.  

Personality-wise, Esme shared the ruthless, dominating side of Frost, while Sophie displayed Frost's later heroic nature and ideals. They both sought [[individuality]], as Emma had during her teenage years, especially before leaving her family.

''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]'' informs that the Stepford sisters are a result of John Sublime's theft of [[Emma Frost]]'s egg-cells. What is not revealed  however, is what other genetic sources were combined with Emma's to create the Cuckoos - as they are her offspring, instead of her clones because egg-cell couldn't possibly create a viable being, which would explain the difference in hair phenotype between themselves and their "mother".

==Personalities==
*'''Esme''' : She was the first to split from her sisters, falling in love with Shi'ar-soldier-in-disguise [[Image:Esme.png|100pxpx|thumb|Esme, after leaving her sisters and joining Xorn's Brotherhood of Mutants]] Kato/Stuff leading to recurring joke about the other Cuckoos always disliking their sister's boyfriends. After this failed relationship she returned to her sister at least seemingly since she soon afterwards attempted to [[murder]] Frost, which failed, when she was discovered by Sage and Bishop, Esme fled the [[X-Mansion]]. It was revealed  at the same time that Esme had killed Sophie, wanting to seize control of the Cuckoos but having a hard time doing so because Sophie the strongest telepath, so she had used Kick to amplify her own powers and manipulated Sophie into overextending her telepathic powers to the point of death. Esme returned in the [[Planet X (comics)|Planet X]] storyline, in which it was revealed that Esme had been working for [[Xorn]] (who had revealed himself as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], though this would turn out to be another lie) the entire time, and that she had developed a crush on him. However, Esme turned on him and tried to destroy his mind in ''New X-Men'' #150 (February 2004) after he rejected her affections, for which Xorn killed her. She died in Emma's arm who revealed that Esme was the one she was the most proud of.

*'''Sophie''' : Sophie didn't manifest individuality up until her death but she was the dominant mind in the mix, which led to her death (see Esme). She returned once when [[Quentin Quire]] and the Phoenix awoke her but disgusted by Quentin she decide to die again.

*'''Mindee''' : She was the next Cuckoo to become autonome. She had a relationship with Germaine who was killed by a mob when the students were trapped in the X-Corporation building in the aftermath of Planet X. She then had a hate relationship with Jay Guthrie whom she labelled a music hater for he always interrupted while she played the piano. She also helped Gambit during Exodus's Brotherhood's attack on the School and in Black Tom's defeat.

*'''Celeste''' : She was the third Cuckoo to fall in love, this time with SHIELD agent Jake. She was then chosen by a Phoenix fragment to be its next host, resulting in the Warsong events.

*'''Phoebe''' : So far, Phoebe hasn't been seen to be independant at all.

==Alternate versions==
* In the "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" timeline, 150 years from now, Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe are members of the X-Men and operators of Cerebra, having merged with the machine, and calling themselves '''Three-in-One'''. Their psychic powers have also been amplified, allowing them to see the future. They also appear to be in their early to mid-twenties, despite the long time that has passed. While not made explicit, a healing factor could be responsible for their youthful appearance.
* In ''[[House of M]]'', the quintuplets were part of the New Mutant Leadership Program at the United Nations. From the five, Sophie appeared to be the one with the stronger personality. Sophie joined [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]], [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] and the rest of the New Mutants on their trip to Japan to find Seiji Ashida, while Celeste, Esme, Mindee, and Phoebe remained on New York, though they agreed to maintain the secret.
* In the alternate future depicted in ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe have each developed their own look and now call themselves the '''Spikes'''.

==Trivia==
*The first appearance of the Stepford Cuckoos was in ''New X-Men'' #118 (November 2001); however, they were not identified by name. They were first called the Stepford Cuckoos in ''New X-Men'' #123 (April 2002), which was also the first issue in which Esme was named. Sophie, Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee were named in ''New X-Men'' #134 (January 2003), ''New X-Men'' #149 (January 2004), ''New X-Men'' #153 (April 2004), and ''New X-Men'' #156 (June 2004), respectively. In the ''New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook'', their last name was confirmed as "Cuckoo" and their codename as the "Three-in-One".
*Originally, the first letter of each of the Cuckoo's names was supposed to spell out the word "spice" when put in proper sequence, '''S'''ophie, '''P'''hoebe, '''C'''eleste and '''E'''sme. However, Grant Morrison never mentioned the name of the fifth Cuckoo (the one whose name was supposed to start with "'''I'''") during his run on New X-Men, and it was only later on that this fifth Cuckoo was dubbed "Mindee" by writer Chuck Austen, who was unaware of Morrison's easter egg. Mindee was Austen's pet Cuckoo.
*Their name is an allusion to the [[Stepford Wives]] and the [[Midwich Cuckoos]].  The Cuckoos and their abilities are roughly based on those of the "Paper-dolls", telepathic quadruplets from a [[1964]] novel by [[L. P. Davies]].

==In other media==
* The Stepford Cuckoos appear as antagonists in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.
* Three identical blond girls were shown in the background in an Institute Scene in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. Writer Zak Penn confirmed in a chat that these were indeed the Stepford Cuckoos. [http://www.thexverse.com/community/showthread.php?t=762&page=5]
