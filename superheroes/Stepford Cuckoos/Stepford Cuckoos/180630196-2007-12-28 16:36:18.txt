The '''Stepford Cuckoos''' are a group of [[fictional character|fictional]] mutant psychically-linked [[Multiple birth|quintuplets]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], students at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. Known properly as '''Celeste''', '''Esme''', '''Mindee''', '''Phoebe''', and '''Sophie Cuckoo'''; their names, when placed in alphabetical order, also denote their respective ages-- with Celeste being the first "born" and Sophie being the youngest. 

Originally calling themselves the '''Five-in-One''', with the deaths of Esme and Sophie the remaining sisters are now known as the '''Three-in-One''' in ''[[New X-Men]]'' #149-150.

First appearing in ''[[New X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #118, they were created by [[Grant Morrison]]. Their origin, as the artificially created "daughters" of [[Emma Frost]], is revealed in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]]''.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Origins===
As revealed in the first issue of ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|Phoenix: Warsong]]'' the sisters are grown from ova cells harvested from [[Emma Frost]] while she lay comatose after the Sentinel attack that killed her students, the original Hellions, and are only five of many of such cloned daughters. The remaining hundreds (if not thousands) of Cuckoo sisters reside within incubation chambers inside a hidden underground laboratory at ''The World'', the complex where the latest [[Weapon Plus]] living weapons: [[Huntsman (comics)|Huntsman]], [[Fantomex]] and [[Ultimaton]], were created. They were planned to be powerful weapons able to kill every mutant by concentrating on their signatures. Like Fantomex was Weapon XIII, the Cuckoos were branded ''Weapon XIV''

[[Image:TeenStepfordCuckoos.jpg|left|thumb|The Five-in-One]]They were first introduced as the protégés and favorites of [[Emma Frost]] and along with [[Quentin Quire]], were noted as the strongest [[telepath]]s among the fourth-generation students at the [[Xavier Institute of Higher Learning]]. It is still unknown though how they ended up being at the Institute in the first place and why they didn't remember being weapons. Although Quire and the Stepford Cuckoos were rivals, Quire had a crush on Sophie. Sophie and the other Cuckoos considered him to be disgusting and rejected him completely.

Partly as an expression of adolescent rebellion, partly under the influence of the drug Kick, and partly out of a desire to impress Sophie, Quire incited a riot at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. Sophie died stopping Quire in ''New X-Men'' #137 (April 2003), having used the drug [[List_of_comic_book_drugs#Kick|Kick]] to boost her powers. The Stepford Cuckoos held Frost to be partially responsible for Sophie's death and disassociated themselves from Frost at that time, declaring they would work with Madame LaFarge in Switzerland. With the death of Sophie, the Five-in-One became the Four-in-One. Wary of having a part of themselves missing, they tested to see if their powers were still evident by contacting [[Jean Grey]] telepathically and informing her that Emma Frost was attempting to conduct an affair with Cyclops.

Unbeknownst to anyone, Esme Cuckoo had been collaborating with [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], currently disguised as the X-man [[Xorn]]. Taking control of the Cuckoos' telepathic groupmind, she steered Angel Salvadore to attack Emma Frost, shattering Emma's diamond body into fragments. After [[Jean Grey]] managed to telekinetically reassemble Emma and return her to life, she revealed Esme's guilt. As Bishop and Sage confronted her, they came under telepathic attack from the Cuckoos, who left the mansion.

Revealing himself, Magneto destroyed the X-Mansion and went on to launch an all-out attack on New York. With help from Esme and his Special Class from the Xavier Institute, he held the city hostage and began rounding up its human residents and preparing them for execution. During this, he accidentally killed one of his students, [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]]. His plan was to use his powers to reverse the earth's magnetic poles and remake the world for mutants. He is confronted by the X-Men, who were led into his headquarters by [[Beak (comics)|Beak]], who had a key. During the fight Esme attacks him, angry that Magneto had not noticed her. She uses her powers to give Magneto Alzheimer's in fast forward, but Magneto grabs her metallic earrings and plunges them into her brain, killing her. Magneto is killed by Wolverine, but not before killing [[Jean Grey]].

The Magneto who collaborated with Esme and attacked New York was later [[retcon]]ned to have been [[Xorn|Kuan-Yin Xorn]] impersonating Magneto, rather than Magneto himself.

===Corsairs and becoming the Phoenix===
Soon afterwards, the Institute was rebuilt, with Emma Frost and [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] as headmasters and leaders of the [[X-Men]]. Frost and Summers divided the older students into several six-person training squads, each taught by a staff member. The remaining three Cuckoos, now calling themselves the '''Three-in-One''', were assigned to the [[Corsairs]] squad, led by Frost's boyfriend Cyclops. The three girls were the co-leaders of the squad.

In ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong|X-Men: Phoenix Endsong]]'' (March-June 2005), the [[Phoenix Force]] came back to earth seeking the body of Jean Grey. Kid Omega, still in love with Sophie, sensed the Phoenix and [[exhumation|exhumed]] Sophie's body. Kid Omega sought the Phoenix, which resurrected Sophie, but she promptly chose to die again once she realized why Kid Omega had wanted to resurrect her. Following the return of the Phoenix to the White Hot Room, a shard of it in firefly form flew to one of the Cuckoos, who replied, "What took you so long?" 

In the wake of [[House of M]], in which the vast majority of the world's mutant population was depowered, the Cuckoos retained their powers. With few students left, the squad system was dissolved and Emma Frost placed the remaining students into an all-out brawl to determine who would be part of an in-training X-Men team. The Cuckoos, still resentful of Emma, refused to participate. Instead, they ran to Cyclops and informed him of Frost's plan, of which he was unaware. They still reside at the Xavier Institute.

===Weapon Plus & Phoenix - Warsong===

[[Image:Cuckoosweapon.png|left|100px|The Stepford Cuckoos are identified as Weapon XIV. Art by [[Marc Silvestri]].|thumb]]
In ''New X-Men'' #154 (May 2004), [[Grant Morrison]]'s last issue of ''New X-Men'', the Stepford Cuckoos are identified as Weapon XIV (each girl being units 1 to 5, ordered alphabetically by their first names), the living weapon code between Weapon XIII ([[Fantomex]]) and Weapon XV ([[Ultimaton]]).

[[Image:Warsong3.PNG|right|150px|Cover to ''Phoenix: Warsong #3'', by [[Marc Silvestri]].]]
Manipulated by both the Phoenix and Sublime, the Cuckoos awoke their dead sisters and travelled to the ''[[Weapon Plus#The World|World]]'', a laboratory created by [[Weapon Plus]] with technology capable of manipulating time, where [[Fantomex]], [[Huntsman (comics)|Huntsman]] and [[Ultimaton (comics)|Ultimaton]] were created. During the sisters' visit to "The World," they were greeted by a computer image of [[John Sublime]]. It is revealed that the Phoenix fragment has manifested in order to destroy the Cuckoos and all of their clones to prevent them from being activated as a weapon and kill all mutants - Sophie and Esme being the first such casualties of its purge. Emma, Mindee, and Phoebe were successful in stunting Celeste's linkage with the Phoenix; only to be ambushed by Sublime's machinery, which absorbed the cosmic fragment and distributes it among each of the cloned telepaths. Now referring to themselves as the Thousand-in-One and under Sublime's control; the cosmically-empowered psychics proceed to enact their programmed destiny of mutant destruction. Celeste however, is still in partial control of both herself and her sisters' supermind, alerts the X-Men that they can short-circuit the girls' linkage by destroying Sublime's machinery; which they do. Phoebe, distraught at having lost access to the cosmic power, sends a bolt of her last remaining energy through the facility's floor... prompting an explosion that would destroy everything within a half-mile radius. Celeste, at Emma's behest, accepts her role as a Phoenix host, and stops the explosion by temporarily freezing localized time. She then goes on to destroy the thousand-strong Cuckoo clones, by shattering their newly-manifested Diamond forms; before casting the entity out of her body. It however, refuses to depart the area; to which Celeste reacts by reabsorbing force into her own and her two remaining sisters' diamond hearts. Unlike their mother's diamond composition, the Cuckoo's hearts haven't a single flaw; and as such, nothing can destroy, enter, or escape them... even the splintered Phoenix itself. The price the sisters must pay for this, is that they can never again feel emotion; thus leaving them even more cold-hearted and detached from their fellow man than they were before.

===Post Civil War===
The Stepford Cuckoos are being considered as "potential recruits" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.
The girls are next seen helping Elixir master medical and anatomical knowledge via Beast's brain. They are soon after teleported to Limbo with the other students and captured by Belasco who has helmets placed on them to keep them asleep to prevent them from using their powers. They were freed by a newly revived X-23 and turn the tide of the battle against Belasco.  At the battle's end, Magik sends them and the rest of the student body back to Earth. When the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks Xavier, the [[Astonishing X-Men]] and the [[New X-Men]], the Stepford Cuckoos contact several other X-teams such as Excalibur, the Uncanny X-team, and X-Factor to get their help. They then help [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]] access all his forgotten knowledge and abilities to compensate for his power loss as thanks for when he saved them during the [[Purifiers]]' attack on the school.

==Powers and abilities==
The Cuckoos are a [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[hive mind]] capable of transforming their individual bodies into indestructible diamond. Powerful telepaths individually, their combined power is even greater than the sum of its parts. These powers allow them the psychic standards of broadcasting/receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, force blasts of pure psionic energy, astral projection, etc.

Though they most often function and act as one unit, they are indeed capable of thinking and operating individually. When all five sisters were alive, Sophie was the dominant consciousness and often commanded the Cuckoos. However, as implied by Esme's actions, it is possible for another one of the Cuckoos to wrest control of the [[gestalt]] and perhaps even use the powers of all sisters without the consent and knowledge of the others. With the loss of Sophie and Esme, The Cuckoos are not as strong as they were with five.<ref>X-men #142</ref>

Like their mother, Emma Frost; each Cuckoo sister also possesses the ability to transform herself into an organic diamond, and as such becomes completely impervious to harm. Unlike Frost, however, their Diamond forms are flawless; such that nothing can enter or escape their core. Also unlike their progenitor; they can never feel the effects of emotion, even when in their "normal" tissue form, due to their hearts' perpetual diamond status. During the ''Warsong'' series, the Cuckoos were also observed to have gained the power of flight, presumably from Phoenix-induced telekinesis. With the Phoenix fragment splintered and held captive inside of their diamond hearts, it has yet to be revealed if the sisters have retained their ability to fly.

The power level of the Cuckoos, in all of their incarnations, have been reported by many of the staff at Xavier's School to be extremely impressive and strong; these staff members include: [[Professor X]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Emma Frost]], and [[Beast (comics)|Henry McCoy]]. 



===Personalities===
[[Image:Esme.png|100pxpx|thumb|Esme, after leaving her sisters and joining Xorn's Brotherhood of Mutants]] 
*'''Esme:''' She was the first to split from her sisters, falling in love with [[Shi'ar]]-soldier-in-disguise [[Kato]]/[[Stuff (comics)|Stuff]]. This led to a recurring joke about the other Cuckoos always disliking their sister's boyfriends. After this failed relationship she seemed to return to her sisters, though she soon attempted to [[murder]] Frost. She failed, and when she was discovered by Sage and Bishop, Esme fled the [[X-Mansion]]. It was also revealed that Esme was the one responsible for the events that killed Sophie. Wanting to seize control of the Cuckoos but having a hard time doing so because Sophie was resisting the takeover, Esme used the drug Kick on herself to augment her own psychic powers and take control of the Stepford Cuckoos's group mind. Esme manipulated her sister Sophie into also using the drug Kick in order to overexert her telepathic powers to the point of death. Esme returned in the [[Planet X (comics)|Planet X]] storyline, in which it was revealed that Esme had been working for [[Xorn]] the entire time, and that she had developed a crush on him. However, Esme turned on him and tried to destroy his mind in ''New X-Men'' #150 (February 2004) after he rejected her affections. Xorn reluctantly was forced to kill her by manipulating her metal earrings into bullets that repeatedly pierced the inside of her head. She died in Emma's arms, who told Esme that out of all the Cuckoos, Emma was most proud of her. Esme was resurrected in the [[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|''Warsong'' series]] along with Sophie, but a Phoenix-powered Celeste destroyed them both in her judgment to burn away what doesn't work.

*'''Sophie:''' Sophie didn't manifest individuality until just before her death. She was, however, the dominant mind amongst her sisters, which ultimately led to her death. When Quentin Quire began a riot on the Xavier Campus, Sophie (being subtly coerced by Esme) got high off Kick to strengthen her power and fight him. The experience killed Sophie and caused her sisters to distance themselves to Emma Frost. She returned once when [[Quentin Quire]] and the Phoenix awoke her but disgusted by Quentin she decide to die again. She later returned, along with Esme in the [[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|''Warsong'' series]]; only to be incinerated by Celeste. 

*'''Mindee:''' She was the next Cuckoo to become autonomous. She had a relationship with Germaine who was killed by a mob when the students were trapped in the X-Corporation building in the aftermath of Planet X. She then had a combative relationship with [[Icarus (comics)|Jay Guthrie]] whom was always interrupting her while she played the piano. She also helped Gambit during Exodus's Brotherhood's attack on the School and in Black Tom's defeat.

*'''Celeste:''' She was the third Cuckoo to fall in love, this time with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Jake Oh. She was then chosen by a Phoenix fragment to be its next host, resulting in the Warsong events. While being empowered by the Phoenix Force fragment, she was able to freeze time in order to protect the X-Men from an imminent explosion. She then apologetically proceeded to kill her recently resurrected sisters Esme and Sophie, as well as the Thousand-In-One sister clones as part of her judgment. When the Phoenix Force fragment refused to depart afterwards, Celeste split it into three and sealed each part into the diamond hearts of Mindee, Phoebe, and herself, trapping the Phoenix Force fragment there forever at the price of rendering all three permanently emotionless.

*'''Phoebe:''' Phoebe demonstrated the power-hungry aspect of Emma's personality, similar to the latter's days as White Queen of the Hellfire Club. In contrast to Esme, Phoebe desired power out of the sheer affinity for wielding it, rather than as a means for individuality.

*'''The Thousand-In-One:''' numerous clones of the Cuckoos, they were only seen calling Emma their mother before being killed by the Phoenix, using Celeste's body.

==Other versions==
===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the "[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]" timeline, 150 years from now, Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe are members of the X-Men and operators of Cerebra, having merged with the machine, and calling themselves '''Three-in-One'''. Their psychic powers have also been amplified, allowing them to see the future. They also appear to be in their early to mid-twenties, despite the long time that has passed. While not made explicit, a healing factor could be responsible for their youthful appearance. With the release of the Warsong series this can be attributed to the nanites in their bodies and the fact that they are manufactured "weapons".

===House of M===
In ''[[House of M]]'', the quintuplets were part of the New Mutant Leadership Program at the United Nations. From the five, Sophie appeared to be the one with the stronger personality. Sophie joined [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]], [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] and the rest of the New Mutants on their trip to Japan to find Seiji Ashida, while Celeste, Esme, Mindee, and Phoebe remained on New York, though they agreed to maintain the secret.

===X-Men: The End===
In the alternate future depicted in ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe have each developed their own look and now call themselves '''the Spikes'''.

==Trivia==
{{trivia|date=June 2007}}
*The first appearance of the Stepford Cuckoos was in ''New X-Men'' #118 (November 2001); however, they were not identified by name. They were first called the Stepford Cuckoos in ''New X-Men'' #123 (April 2002), which was also the first issue in which Esme was named. Sophie, Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee were named in ''New X-Men'' #134 (January 2003), ''New X-Men'' #149 (January 2004), ''New X-Men'' #153 (April 2004), and ''New X-Men'' #156 (June 2004), respectively. In the ''New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook'', their last name was confirmed as "Cuckoo" and their codename as the "Three-in-One".
*Originally, the first letter of each of the Cuckoo's names was supposed to spell out the word "spice" when put in proper sequence, '''S'''ophie, '''P'''hoebe, '''C'''eleste and '''E'''sme. However, Grant Morrison never mentioned the name of the fifth Cuckoo (the one whose name was supposed to start with "'''I'''") during his run on New X-Men, and it was only later on that this fifth Cuckoo was named "Mindee" by [[Chuck Austen]], who was unaware of Morrison's easter egg. Mindee was Austen's pet Cuckoo during his subsequent run in [[X-Men (vol. 2)]].
*Their name is an allusion to [[The Stepford Wives]] and the [[The Midwich Cuckoos]]. The Cuckoos and their abilities are roughly based on those of the "Paper-dolls", telepathic quadruplets from a [[1964]] novel by [[L. P. Davies]].

==In other media==
===Video games===
The Stepford Cuckoos appear as antagonists in the video game ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. They were the ones who boosted up [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]]'s powers at an abandoned Weapon X facility.

===Film===
Three identical blond girls were shown in the background in an Institute Scene in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. Writer Zak Penn confirmed in a chat that these were indeed the Stepford Cuckoos. [http://www.thexverse.com/community/showthread.php?t=762&page=5]
