The '''Stepford Cuckoos''' are a group of [[fictional character]]s of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  They are three (formerly five) [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[teenage]] girls, born as [[quintuplet]]s, in training to be [[X-Men]]. [[telepathy|Telepaths]], their minds are usually in contact and can be linked together into a group mind. They therefore sometimes referred to themselves as the '''Five-in-One'''. Two of the five, '''Esme''' and '''Sophie''', are dead; the remaining three, '''Celeste''', '''Mindee''', and '''Phoebe''', sometimes refer to themselves as the '''Three-in-One'''. Like their former mentor [[Emma Frost]], they are [[blonde-haired]] and [[blue-eye]]d, though their eyes glow [[white]] when they use their telepathic [[superpower]]s. Their name is an [[allusion]] to the [[Stepford Wives]] and the [[Midwich Cuckoos]].

==First appearance==
The [[first appearance]] of the Stepford Cuckoos was in ''New X-Men'' #118 (November 2001); however, they were not identified by name. They were first called the Stepford Cuckoos in ''New X-Men'' #123 (April 2002), which was also the first issue in which Esme was named. Sophie, Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee were named in ''New X-Men'' #134 (January 2003), ''New X-Men'' #149 (January 2004), ''New X-Men'' #153 (April 2004), and ''New X-Men'' #156 (June 2004), respectively. In the ''New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook'', their last name was confirmed as "Cuckoo" and their codename as the "Three-in-One".

==Biographies==
[[Image:TeenStepfordCuckoos.jpg|left|thumb]]

Writer [[Grant Morrison]] introduced the Stepford Cuckoos as the protégés of [[Emma Frost]] and, along with [[Kid Omega]], the strongest [[telepath]]s among the fourth-generation students at the [[Xavier Institute of Higher Learning]]. Although Kid Omega and the Stepford Cuckoos were rivals, Kid Omega had a crush on Sophie. Sophie and the other Cuckoos considered him to be disgusting and rejected him completely. Partly as an expressions of adolescent rebellion, partly under the influence of the drug Kick, and partly out of a desire to impress Sophie, Kid Omega incited a riot at the [[X-Mansion]]. Sophie died stopping Kid Omega in ''New X-Men'' #137 (April 2003). The Stepford Cuckoos held Frost to be partially responsible for Sophie's death and disassociated themselves from Frost at that time. With the death of Sophie, the Five-in-One became the Four-in-One.

Soon afterwards, Esme attempted to [[murder]] Frost, an attempt which failed. Esme fled the [[X-Mansion]], and it was revealed that Esme had really been responsible for Sophie's death. Esme wanted to seize control of the Cuckoos, but had a hard time doing so because Sophie was the dominant personality and the strongest telepath. Therefore, Esme had concocted a plan to become dominant by using Kick to amplify her own powers and by manipulating Sophie into overextending her telepathic powers to the point of death. With the departure of Esme, the Four-in-One were now the Three-in-One.

Esme returned in the [[Planet X (comics)|Planet X]] storyline, in which it was revealed that Esme had been working for [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] (who had masqueraded as [[Xorn]]) the entire time. When Esme turned on him in ''New X-Men'' #150 (February 2004), Magneto killed her. (It was later revealed that the person who was apparently Magneto was actually a Magneto imposter.)

In ''X-Men: Phoenix Endsong'' (March-June 2005), Kid Omega, still in love with Sophie, [[exhumation|exhumed]] and [[resurrection|resurrected]] her, but she promptly chose to die again once she realized why Kid Omega had wanted to resurrect her.

The Cuckoos now appear in ''[[New X-Men: Academy X]]'', wherein they were co-leaders of the Corsairs squad under the mentorship of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].

==Superpowers==
The Stepford Cuckoos are [[telepathy|telepaths]]. Sophie was the dominant and most powerful one before she died. The Cuckoos are usually in telepathic contact with each other, and they have the ability to fully combine their minds into one extremely powerful supermind. However, with the loss of two of their number, their powers as the Three-in-One are considerably weakened from when they were the Five-in-One.

==Link to Weapon Plus?==
In ''New X-Men'' #154 (May 2004), [[Grant Morrison]]'s last issue of ''New X-Men'', the Stepford Cuckoos are identified as Weapon XIV. However, whether the Stepford Cuckoos actually are linked to the [[Weapon X]] Project is extremely doubtful, for several reasons:
* The issue is set in an [[alternate future]] which never comes to pass.
* Various other events and facts in the issue contradict [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].
* No other comic book has ever mentioned or drawn any connection between the Stepford Cuckoos and the Weapon Plus Program.
However, an interview with Mike Marts stated that more will be revealed about the Cuckoos in early 2006.

==Boyfriends==
Writers have continued to use a running joke about [[boyfriend]]s of the Stepford Cuckoos. Thus far, whenever one of the Stepford Cuckoos has become involved in a romantic relationship, the other Stepford Cuckoos have usually expressed strong disapproval, perhaps out of [[jealousy]]. On the other hand, perhaps the disapproval is justified, considering that the Cuckoos have had an extremely poor track record when it comes to boyfriends:
* Esme's boyfriend Kato, seen in ''New X-Men'' #123 (April 2002), apparently a [[Japan]]ese mutant, turned out to actually be the [[sponge]]-like Stuff, an "advance [[scout]] of the [[Shi'ar Imperial Guard|Shi'ar Superguardian Team]], assigned to lifeform sterilization procedure."
* [[Kid Omega]] had a crush on Sophie (which she did not return) and engaged in such actions for her sake as inciting a riot at the [[X-Mansion]] (indirectly causing her death) and [[resurrection|resurrecting]] her (an action she promptly rejected).
* Germaine, Mindee's boyfriend who first appeared in ''New X-Men'' #155 (June 2004), died the very next issue, #156 (June 2004), defending her from an anti-mutant [[mob]].
* When Xavier's Institute held a dance to celebrate the end of the school year, all three Cuckoos attended the dance with Julian Keller ([[Hellion (comics)|Hellion]]). It should be noted that Julian is extremely arrogant, sometimes cruel, and, as one of the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]], is one of the antagonists of ''New Mutants'' v2 and ''New X-Men: Academy X''. Julian later left his dates to have a dance with Wind Dancer, whom he shares a mutual attraction.
