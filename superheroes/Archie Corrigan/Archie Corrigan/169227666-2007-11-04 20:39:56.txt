'''Archie Corrigan''' is a fictional comic book character from the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. 

==Fictional character biography==

He is a friend of [[Wolverine (comics)|Patch]] and is a [[Aviator|pilot]]. He owns and operates South Seas Skyways, of which he was the entire company.  He lives in [[Madripoor]].

Corrigan has helped Patch out on several encounters with the criminal elements of Madripoor. 

One of his encounters involves him asking Patch along to a competency hearing for his brother, as part of moral support. Archie's brother, Burt, sometimes believes he is any number of movie characters. He was being cared for in his own home but another relative had called the hearing. Archie believed this woman was simply after Burt's inheritance.

Archie, Patch, and [[Jessica Drew]] flew from Madripoor to San Francisco for the hearing, using old smuggling skills to avoid custom agents and other aspects of the law.

Burt, happy to see his brother, was surprisingly stable at the moment and Archie felt good about how the hearing would go. Unforutnately Burt was late to the hearing. He would arrive, fifteen minutes off schedule, crashing through the window on a horse. Everyone would believe he was having another 'episode', until a large group of fanged monstrosities followed Burt in. 

In a subsequent incident, it is learned that [[Professor X]] knows of and trusts Archie. The X-Men [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], who is traveling to Madripoor, is told to contact him. He does not do so, as he is distracted by other forces.

Some time later, Archie and several of Patch's friends are slain inside Patch's bar by the forces of [[Nguyen Ngoc Coy]] and Madripoor's ruler, [[Prince Baran]]. Artificial claws were used in order to make Patch believe he did it. The two wished to frame Wolverine for the crimes. Coy and Baran soon died violently themselves.

==Powers and abilities==
Although he had no actual [[List of comic book superpowers|super powers]], Archie was a good [[Hand to hand combat|fighter]], pilot, and smuggler.
