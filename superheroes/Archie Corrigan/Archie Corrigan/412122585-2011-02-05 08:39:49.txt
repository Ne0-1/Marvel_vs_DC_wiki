===Archie's brother===
Archie's father passes away, leaving him thirty dollars, one dollar for every year of aggravation. His brother Burt, a mentally unstable man, gains the majority of the inheritance. Archie's Aunt Ruth calls a competency hearing for Burt. Archie asks Patch to come with him as moral support. All believe Ruth is simply after Burt's money. Archie's brother manifests a disconnect with reality, seeing life in terms of action movie stars.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol 2 #11 (September 1989)</ref> 

Archie, Patch, and [[Jessica Drew]] fly from Madripoor to San Francisco for the hearing, using old smuggling skills to avoid custom agents and other aspects of the law. They soon become involve in an internation chase for the 'Gehenna Stone'; it causes people to act irrationally in order to own it. It also potentially serves as the seat of power for the Annunaki deity Ba'al-Hadad. The demon can manifest vampire like creatures, which consistently pursue Archie and his allies. The demon is killed back in Madripoor, in the home of [[Prince Baran]]. Burt moves on with his life, later seen breaking the bank at a casino.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol 2 #12-16 (1989-1990)</ref>

===Professor X===
In a subsequent incident, it is learned that [[Professor X]] knows of and trusts Archie. The X-Man [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], who is traveling to Madripoor, is told to contact him. He does not do so, as he is distracted by other forces.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Some time later, Archie and several of Patch's friends are slain inside Patch's bar. This includes Rose and Richard O'Donnel, the latter being a former operator of the bar <ref>''Wolverine: Save The Tiger'' one-shot (1992)</ref>. This is the result of General Nguyen Ngoc Coy and Madripoor's ruler, Prince Baran. Artificial claws were used in order to make Patch believe he did it. The two wished to frame Wolverine for the crimes and then have him secretly killed in the basement of the police station run by Chief Tai. Logan escapes and kills the goons sporting artificial claws that committed the murder. To save himself Baran kills Coy. The crime lord Tiger Tyger, AKA [[Jessan Hoan]], shoots Prince Baran in the back, having returned from murdering Police Chief Tai.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol2 #98 (Feb 1996)</ref> 

Despite this chaos, Archie later assists Wolverine, the [[Silver Samurai]] and other allies in transport to an ancient mystical temple. There Wolverine destroys a magical being called the 'Doombringer'.<ref>"Wolverine: Doombringer" One-shot (November 1997)</ref>
