'''"Black" Jack Tarr''' is a fictional character in the Marvel Universe.  Jack Tarr is Sir [[Denis Nayland Smith]]'s aide-de-camp, and is a powerful giant of a man with a gruff manner. 

Tarr served with distinction in the Biritish army, and accepted a position with the [[British Foreign Service]] after his discharge from the military.  Sometime later, he became an agent for the British intelligence agency, [[MI-6]].  Eventually, he was assigned to the command of Sir Denis Nayland Smith of [[Scotland Yard]].

While serving with Smith, Tarr came into contact with [[Shang-Chi]] and the small band of adventurers fighting a covert war against the criminal mastermind Dr. [[Fu Manchu]].  When Fu Manchu was finally defeated, this group elected to remain together as private adventurers under the name [[Freelance Restorations]], and Tarr eventually became the leader of Freelance Restorations when Smith retired.
