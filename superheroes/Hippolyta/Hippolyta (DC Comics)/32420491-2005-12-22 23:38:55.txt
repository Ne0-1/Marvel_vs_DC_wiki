'''Queen Hippolyta''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero|superheroine]], based on [[Hippolyte]], Queen of the [[Amazons]] in [[Greek mythology]]. 

==History==
Hippolyta and the rest of the [[themyscira|Themyscirian]] Amazons were first created by a select few of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek Gods]], which included [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], [[Hestia]], [[Demeter]] and [[Aphrodite]]. They took the souls of women slain throughout time by the hands of men and sent them to the bottom of the [[Aegean Sea]]. The souls then began for form bodies with the clay on the sea bed. Once they reached the surface the clay bodies became living flesh and blood Amazons. The first one to break surface was Hippolyta and thus she was titled as Queen of the new race. The second Amazon to break surface was her sister [[Antiope (disambiguation)|Antiope]] and she ruled as a second to Hippolyta in all affairs. Each of the goddesses that created the Amazons blessed them with personalized gifts: hunting skills (Artemis'), wisdom (Athena's), warm homes (Hestia's), plentiful harvests (Demeter's), and beauty inside and out (Aphrodite's). The Amazons eventually founded the city of [[Themyscira]] in [[Turkey]] and became known as fierce warriors of peace in both Turkey and [[Greece]].

The jealous and vengeful god [[Ares]] soon after tried to discredit their name by having his half-brother demi-god [[Heracles|Herakles]] invade the Amazons and demean their standing. When Herakles first approached the Amazons seeking battle, Hippolyta met him outside the city gates and tried to reason with him for peaceful negotiations. When this did not work and Herakles attacked the Amazon Queen using his strength to his advantage, Hippolyta easily turned the tables on him by using her wisdom and battle skills to subdue him. Still wishing peace, Hippolyta invited Herakles and his men into their city to celebrate a potential friendship with a feast. Hiding his anger, Herakles accepted the invitation. Once in their stronghold, Herakles and his men drugged the wine the Amazons were drinking and took them prisoner. After abusing and raping the Amazons, Hippolyta cried out to Athena to help them escape their bonds. Athena said that she would only aid them on the condition that the Amazons not seek retrobution against Herakles and his men as that would be beneath the ideals the Amazons were created to stand for. Hippolyta hastily agreed and the Amazon's bonds were broken and the drugs given wore off. Once out of their drugged state the Amazons were filled with hate and revenge. Breaking Hippolyta's oath to Athena, the Amazons began slaughtering their captures but were upset to find that Herakles and his general [[Theseus]] had returned to their homelands. After the slaughter Athena repremanded the Amazons for disobeying her orders. She demanded the Amazons serve penance for their actions. Though Hippolyta agreed to the goddess' wishes, her sister [[Antiope (mythology)|Antiope]] scoffed at Athena for being angered at them for killing their rapist capturers. Antiope then denounced all ties to the Olympian gods and said goodbye to her sister Hippolyta. She left for Greece, along with half of the Amazon Nation who supported Antiope in her new quest, to battle Herakles and Theseus out of vengance.

Hippolyta and her remaining faithful Amazons then went to the sea shore where the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]] told them their punishment for going against their ideals. They were to be given immortality so that they would forever safeguard a doorway to the underworld called Doom's Doorway. Not only must they protect anyone from entering, but they must also vanquish any evils that try to escape. The doorway was on a far-off isolated island and it would take some time to get there. To guide their way, the god [[Poseidon]] cleared a pathway for them across the seas. Once they arrived at the island the Amazons created a new city and named their new home Themyscira, after their previous fallen city. They continued to live on the island guarding Doom's Doorway, and paying homage to their gods, for 3 thousand years.

It was into this period of living on the island for millenia that Hippolyta began to ache for a child of her own. She prayed to her gods her secret wish and they responded. She was told to go to the sea shore and form the figure of a baby with the island's clay, which she did. The original goddesses again united to create a new Amazon for Queen Hippolyta. It was revealed that in her previous life Hippolyta was a pregnate cavewoman who was killed by her mate. The goddesses used the soul of this unborn child to fall into the clay body of the infant and, just as with the previous Amazons, the clay was changed into flesh and blood. Hippolyta named the child Diana, after a stranger who was washed ashore on the island and helped the Amazons defeat a creature escaping Doom's Doorway with her life.This Diana was later revealed to be the mother to [[Steve Trevor]]. Princess Diana soon after became the hero [[Wonder Woman]].

When Wonder Woman died in a tragic battle with the demon [[Neron]], she was granted divinity as the [[Goddess]] of Truth. During her brief time as a god of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], Diana was replaced in the role of '''Wonder Woman''' by her mother, Queen Hippolyta, who immediately got involved in a mission back to the [[1940s]] with [[Jay Garrick]]. After this mission, she elected to join the [[Justice Society of America]] and remained in that era for eight years. When she returned from the past, Hippolyta took Diana's place in the [[Justice League|JLA]] as well.

In Diana's absence, Hippolyta established a distinguished [[career]]. The Queen enjoyed her role in the Justice Society and became accustomed to life in the [[United States]]. Mother and daughter fought on several occasions over Hippolyta's true role &mdash; heroine or queen &mdash; and their differences were unresolved when the queen sacrificed herself to save the [[Earth]] from [[Imperiex]] during the Imperiex War featured in ''[[Our Worlds At War]]''.
