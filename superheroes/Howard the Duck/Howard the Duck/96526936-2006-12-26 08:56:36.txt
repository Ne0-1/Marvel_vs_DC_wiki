'''Howard the Duck''' is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character]] created by [[Steve Gerber]] for [[Marvel Comics]] and featured in several comic book series of the same name about the misadventures of an ill-tempered humanoid [[duck]] trapped in a human dominated world.  Howard's adventures are generally [[parody|parodies]] of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]], written in a tongue-in-cheek style and combined with a degree of [[metafiction]]al awareness of the limitations of the medium, often very experimental for a non-[[underground comics|underground]] comic.
There was a [[film]] adaptation with the [[Howard the Duck (film)|same title]] in 1986.

==Publication history==
Howard the Duck was created in 1973 by Gerber (with artist [[Val Mayerik]] designing Howard's original look) in the comic book ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'', as a secondary character in that comic's ''[[Man-Thing]]'' story, dropped into the Everglades by the Demonic "Thog the Overmaster" of the dread realm Sominus <ref> Marvel Treasury Edition #12 1976 </ref>. He graduated to his own backup feature in ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'', confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as the Hellcow and the Man-Frog, before acquiring his own comic book title with ''Howard the Duck'' #1 in 1976.

Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series, illustrated by a variety of artists, with [[Gene Colan]] eventually becoming the regular [[penciller]]. The series gradually developed a substantial [[cult following]], possibly amplified by Howard's entry into the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. presidential campaign]] under the auspices of the [[All-Night Party]] (an event later immortalized in a brief reference in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Tommyknockers]]''). Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived ''Howard the Duck'' newspaper strip from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, later written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Alan Kupperberg]].

Due to ''Howard the Duck'' being one of Marvel's few non-[[superhero]] titles, and Gerber's status as one of Marvel's better-known and most unusual writers from his earlier work on ''Man-Thing'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy that was unusual for mass-market comics writers of the time, and the stories became increasingly dark and experimental. At one point, unable to meet deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer.

The story of Howard was picaresque and involved him taking odd jobs and defeating minor villains, often through coincidence.  After five issues in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Howard and Beverly take to the road, eventually ending up in New York where Howard is nominated for president by the All-Night Party.  A doctored photo scandal leads him to [[Canada]], and the defeat of a supervillain, Le Beaver, who falls to his death.  He suffers a nervous breakdown, and after the testimony of recurring foe, S. Blotte the Kidney Lady, is sent to a mental institution, where he meets Winda Wester and is turned briefly into the [[Son of Satan]].  Beverly and Paul Same (an artist upstairs for whom Beverly does nude modeling) get them both back to Cleveland, but after several months, Beverly and Winda are kidnapped by a sheik from a Middle Eastern country.  Upon escaping to a cruise ship, Howard and Beverly are taken by the latter's former classmate, Lester Verde, now styling himself Doctor Bong, who intends to marry Beverly and perform experiments on Howard, as he has, in [[The Island of Dr. Moreau|Moreau]]-like fashion, on other animals, including a female duck named Fifi.  Verde does indeed marry Beverly, and Howard, transformed into a human by Verde, flees with Fifi, who is killed when they crash land in [[Central Park]].  He is restored to his natural form by sleeping with Amy Pope.  By odd coincidence, Howard becomes employed as a dishwasher by Beverly's uncle and namesake, who goes by Lee.  After more adventures, he greets Winda, Paul, and Paul's new patron, Iris Raritan, as the cruise ship ''Damned'' docks.  At a party on [[Long Island]], Iris and her guests are robbed by the [[Circus of Crime]] who abduct Howard.  Ignatz Hubley, a former victim of the circus, tries to shoot the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], but hits Paul instead when Iris intervenes.  After defeating the Circus, plagued by pessimistic dreams, Howard goes his own way, as alone as he was at the beginning of the series.

In 1978, the writer and publisher clashed over issues of creative control, and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. This was the first highly publicized "creator's rights" case in comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to dramatize the case; these included ''[[Destroyer Duck]]'' with [[Jack Kirby]] (Kirby himself helped pave the way for [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] comics with his series ''[[Captain Victory]]'') and ''Stewart the Rat'' with Gene Colan. 

The series continued for four more issues with stories by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Mark Evanier]], and [[Bill Mantlo]] (Gerber returned briefly to write, though not plot, #29, as part of a contract fulfillment), but fans of the original series did not respond well to the loss of Gerber. Marvel re-launched ''Howard the Duck'' in 1979 as a bimonthly magazine &mdash; an unusual format for mass-market comics at the time &mdash; with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan as well as [[Michael Golden]], and unrelated backup features by others; this series was canceled after nine issues.  Articles in these issues state that Howard was Mayerik's idea, though this is contrary to either Gerber or Mayerik's claim, though it follows Marvel's house art-first style.  Mantlo, beginning with Issue #30, returned the series to its former [[status quo]], bringing Beverly back into the picture and having her divorce Doctor Bong, and getting Paul Same out of the hospital.  Lee Switzler brings everyone back to Cleveland and employs Howard as a cab driver, while Paul, back to being a somnambulator after his release from the hospital, seems to have become Winda's boyfriend.  The second story of issue #9, written by [[Steven Grant]] had Howard walk away from Beverly.  Grant followed that with a story in ''[[Bizarre Adventures]]'' #34, in which the suicidal Howard is put through a parody of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.  Issue #32, again written by Steven Grant, appeared in early 1986; #33, by Christopher Stager, some nine months later, along with a three-issue adaptation of the movie.

In 2001, with Marvel under new management and launching its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of "mature readers" comics, Gerber returned to his former publisher to write a six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]], illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters, it, like the original series, parodied a wide range of other comics and [[pop culture]] figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than would have been allowable 25 years earlier.  The series as Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a rat, and entering a scenario parodying [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]''.  (It should be noted that Gaiman and Gerber have mutual admiration for each other's work.)

He had cameo appearances in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (1st series) #3 (Feb. 2005) and (2nd series), # 3/100 (Feb. 2006, the 100th issue of all the various She-Hulk series). He was also featured in Ghost Rider Volume 2 issue #81, cover dated January 1997 with a cameo appearance.

In the [[one-shot]] multi-character [[omnibus (media)|omnibus]] ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Choosing Sides]]'' (Feb. 2006), Howard attempts to register under the [[Superhero Registration Act]], but learns his socially disruptive life has created so many bureaucratic headaches that the government's policy is that Howard does not exist. This lack of government oversight delights him: "No more parking tickets, no taxes, no jury duty." In this story, as well, Howard says he was pressured to give up cigars.

==Characters==
Howard the Duck, as his name suggests, is a three-foot-tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[duck]]. He generally wears a tie and shirt, and is almost always found smoking a [[cigar]]. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to [[Donald Duck]], and Marvel redesigned that aspect of character.

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude to the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though has no goals but comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, "Trapped in a world he never made", played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]]<!--the following is a presumption, and needs to be attributed to a critic, an editor, Gerber, etc.:  , but also reflected the sense of alienation that Howard shared with the majority of his readers-->. A common reaction to meeting Howard the first time is a startled, "You...you're a DUCK!"

His near-constant companion and occasional lover is former art model and [[Cleveland]] native '''Beverly Switzler'''. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though she is a beautiful woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are '''Paul Same''' (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter) and '''Winda Wester''' (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ingenue with [[psychic]] powers).

Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in "the Cosmic Axis". In the black-and-white ''Howard the Duck'' magazine series, writer [[Bill Mantlo]] theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it "very pedestrian" and "'comic-booky' — in the worst sense of the term." He believes Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of cartoon animals.<ref>"Mad Genius, Angry Fowl" Interview, Diamond Comic Distributors, 2001</ref>

His antagonists, who usually appeared in a single story each, are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, and sometimes political figures, but also include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, also known as [[Doctor Bong]] &mdash; modeled on [[Doctor Doom]] and writers [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]] &mdash; is a former [[tabloid]] reporter who has the power to "reorder reality" by smashing himself on his [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet; his main goal is to marry Beverly. After several issues, she agrees to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, and remains married to him for some time. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of ''[[She-Hulk]]'' and ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' in the mid-1990s.  The other recurring villains were included the Kidney Lady (S. Blotte), who had been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she see as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]] and the [[Unification Church]] ([[Moonies]]).  Another important villain was the Sinister S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring from Indecency) organization, whose leader was implicitly [[Anita Bryant]], though she looked like old, fat [[Elvis Presley]] with a [[smiley face]]/[[orange (fruit)|orange]] on her head.

Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]].

Seemingly an [[autodidact]], Howard at various times references [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the [[Brontë]] sisters, and other figures of philosophical and political significance. In a parody of the Marvel comic character [[Shang-Chi]], he was trained in the art of ''Quak-Fu''. In the 2001 miniseries<!--This appears to be a presumption, unless Gerber or an editor confirms it:  , as a mocking gesture toward Disney's mascot [[Mickey Mouse]]-->, he was turned into various animals, primarily a [[mouse]].

==Other media==
*In [[1986 in film|1986]], [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Universal Pictures]] produced the movie '''''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''''', starring [[Lea Thompson]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], [[Tim Robbins]], and [[Chip Zien]] as the voice of Howard. In the film, Howard was brought to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] by a laser experiment gone awry, which also summoned an evil alien spirit called a [[Dark Overlord of the Universe]] intent on destroying the Earth.  Besides Howard (who was portrayed by an assortment of stunt actors in a duck suit) and the Dark Overlord of the Universe (presumably based on [[Thog]] the Overmaster of Sominus, but bearing no resemblance to the character), the only character borrowed from the Marvel Comics mythos was Beverly Switzler, though in this version she became a rock singer. The film was widely panned and was a [[box office bomb]], but it renewed enough attention on the character for Marvel Comics to keep using the character on occasion. Many people consider ''Howard the Duck'' as one of the top 100 [[Films considered the worst ever|worst films]] ever made.{{fact}} The character of Beverly was originally offered to then-unknown singer [[Tori Amos]], but the offer was retracted when Thompson expressed interest. At the time, Amos was the lead singer of the rock band [[Y Kant Tori Read]].{{fact}}

*Howard the Duck was seen on [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s shirt on the animated series ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' (''The Phoenix Saga Part 2'').

*Gower Goose, an ally of [[Megaton Man]], is a satire of Howard the Duck

*In [[Amalgam Comics]], Howard was fused with [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]] to form [[Lobo the Duck]]

*Strangest of all, during a tacitly-approved cross-over between Marvel's "Spider-Man Team-Up" Vol. 1 # 5 and Image Comics' "Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck" #1 (both Nov. 1996), Gerber claims that Howard and Beverly Switzler changed their names to Leonard the Duck and Rhonda Martini, remained in the Image Universe and "were last sighted in Chicago boarding the Amtrak for Buffalo" while the duck who returned to Marvel is "only an empty trademark, a clone whose soul departed him at the corner of Floss and Regret." <ref>"Fowl Play: the Behind-the Scenes Story of Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck #1 by Steve Gerber 1996</ref>.  

*The only Howard the Duck action figure ever released was as a "freebie" companion packed in with the Marvel Legends Series 5 [[Silver Surfer]] action figure by ToyBiz.

==Appearances in Popular Culture==
*In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s book ''[[The Transmigration of Timothy Archer]]'', published in 1982, one of the characters (Angel Archer) reads a current issue of ''Howard the Duck''.
*In [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[The Stand]]'', a character reads a ''Howard the Duck'' comic and is bewildered by the concept.  In the 1990 reissue of the book, the comic was changed to ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''.
*On the rock band [[The Pretenders]]' first album, 1980s ''[[Pretenders (album)|Pretenders]]'', the song "Precious" contains a brief reference.  Songwriter Chrissie Hynde, a native of Northeastern Ohio, uses Cleveland as the backdrop for the song, which includes the lines:
<blockquote>
And Howard the Duck and Mr. Stress [a long-time local bar band] both stayed<br>
Trapped in a world that they never made<br>
But not me, baby, I'm too precious.
</blockquote>

==Trivia==
*In Italy, Howard the Duck was translated as "Orestolo il Papero", which means "Orestolo the Gosling".
<!--"Beginning scenes of what? Also, this claim needs a citation   *In the beginning scenes as Howard is being pulled upward from his homeworld, a brief overhead view of the city he lives in shows that is nearly identical to the city of [[St. Canard]] in [[Darkwing Duck]].-->
