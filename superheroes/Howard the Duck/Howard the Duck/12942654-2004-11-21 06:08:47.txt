'''Howard the Duck''' is a [[comic book]] character created by [[Steve Gerber]] for [[Marvel Comics]] and featured in several comic book series of the same name. Howard's adventures are generally [[parody|parodies]] of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]&mdash;usually set in mundane surroundings such as [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]&mdash;written in a tongue-in-cheek style and combined with a degree of [[metafiction]]al awareness of the limitations of the medium, often very experimental for a non-[[underground comics|underground]] comic.

There was a [[film]] adaptation with the same title in [[1986]].

==Publication history==
Howard the Duck was first created in [[1973]] by Gerber (with artist [[Val Mayerik]] designing Howard's original look) in the comic book ''Adventure into Fear'', as a secondary character in that comic's "[[Man-Thing]]" story. In his appearances with Man-Thing, Howard confronted bizarre horror-parody characters such as the Hellcow and the Man-Frog.

He acquired his own comic book title with ''Howard the Duck'' #1 in [[1976]]. Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series, illustrated by a variety of artists, with [[Gene Colan]] eventually becoming the regular [[penciller]]. The series gradually developed a substantial cult following, possibly amplified by Howard's entry into the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. presidential campaign]] (an event later immortalized in a brief reference in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Tommyknockers]]''). Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived ''Howard the Duck'' newspaper strip from [[1977]] to [[1978]], at first created by Gerber and Colan, later written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Alan Kupperberg]].

Due to ''HtD'' being one of Marvel's few non-[[superhero]] titles, and Gerber's status as one of Marvel's better-known and most unusual writers from his earlier work on ''Man-Thing'' and ''[[The Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy that was unusual for mass-market comics writers of the time, and the stories became increasingly dark and experimental. At one point, unable to meet deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer.

In [[1978]], the writer and publisher clashed over issues of creative control, and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. This was the first highly-publicized "creator's rights" case in comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to dramatize the case; these included ''[[Destroyer Duck]]'' with [[Jack Kirby]] (Kirby himself helped pave the way for creator-owned comics with his series ''Captain Victory'') and ''Stewart the Rat'' with Gene Colan. Gerber did not work for Marvel again until [[2001]].

The series continued for four more issues with stories by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Mark Evanier]], and [[Bill Mantlo]] (Gerber returned briefly to write #29), but fans of the original series did not respond well to the loss of Gerber. Marvel then re-launched ''HtD'' in [[1979]] as a bimonthly magazine&mdash;an unusual format for mass-market comics at the time&mdash;with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan, and unrelated backup features by others; this series was cancelled after nine issues. ''HtD'' was briefly revived in a standard comic format in [[1986]] to coincide with the release of the movie adaptation, but was cancelled again after two issues.

''HtD'' #1-27 and other Gerber-written ''HtD'' stories have been reprinted by Marvel in a paperback collection, ''The Essential Howard the Duck'', ISBN 0785108319.

In 2001, with Marvel under new management and launching its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of "mature readers" comics, Gerber returned to his former publisher to write a six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]], illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]]. Featuring several familiar ''HtD'' characters and, like the original series, parodying a wide range of other comics and [[pop culture]] figures&mdash;but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than would have been allowable 25 years earlier&mdash;the series was generally well reviewed.

==Characters==
Howard, as his name suggests, is a three-foot-tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[humanoid]] [[duck]] from another dimension (populated by his own kind) who finds himself on Earth due to a shift in "the Cosmic Axis". He wears a tie and shirt, and is almost always found smoking a [[cigar]]. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; after [[Disney]] threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to [[Donald Duck]], Marvel redesigned the character so that Howard now wears pants. Howard was once briefly transformed into a human being, and in the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking response to Disney's complaints, he turned into various animals including (ironically) a mouse.

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude to the often bizarre events around him; there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and he has no goals but comfort and to be left alone, but he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, "Trapped in a world he never made," played off the [[genre]] trappings of [[1950s]] [[science fiction]], but also reflected the sense of alienation that Howard shared with the majority of his readers.

His constant companion is former art model and Cleveland native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though she is a beautiful woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter) and Winda Wester (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ingenue with [[psychic]] powers).

His antagonists, who usually appeared in only one story each, are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, and sometimes political figures, but also include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, [[Doctor Bong]]&mdash;modelled on both [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Lester Bangs]]&mdash;is a former [[tabloid]] reporter who has the power to "reorder reality" by smashing himself on his [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet; his main goal is to marry Beverly.

Other Marvel Comics characters have occasionally appeared, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]].

==Howard the Duck: the movie==
In [[1986]], [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Universal Pictures]] produced the movie '''''Howard the Duck''''', starring [[Lea Thompson]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Tim Robbins]]. In the film, Howard was brought to Cleveland by a laser experiment gone awry, which also summoned an evil alien spirit intent on destroying the Earth; besides Howard (who was portrayed by an assortment of stunt actors in a duck suit), the only character borrowed from the comic book was Beverly Switzler, though in this version she became a rock singer. It was widely panned and was a [[box office bomb]], but it renewed enough attention on the character for Marvel Comics to keep using the character on occasion.
