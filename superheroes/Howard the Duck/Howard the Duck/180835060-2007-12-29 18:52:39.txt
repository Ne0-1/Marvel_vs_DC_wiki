'''Howard the Duck''' is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and artist [[Val Mayerik]].  The character first appeared in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #19 (Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, [[anthropomorphic]], "[[funny animal]]" [[cartoon]] trapped on human-dominated Earth.  Howard's adventures are generally social [[satire]]s, and also often [[parody|parodies]] of [[genre fiction]] with a [[metafiction]]al awareness of the medium.

==Publication history==
Howard the Duck was created in 1973 by Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' as a secondary character in that comic's ''[[Man-Thing]]'' feature.  He graduated to his own backup feature in ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'', confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as the Hellcow and the Man-Frog, before acquiring his own comic book title with ''Howard the Duck'' #1 in 1976.

Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series, illustrated by a variety of artists, with [[Gene Colan]] eventually becoming the regular [[penciller]]. The series gradually developed a substantial [[cult following]], possibly amplified by Howard's entry into the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. presidential campaign]] under the auspices of the [[All-Night Party]] (an event later immortalized in a brief reference in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Tommyknockers]]''). Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived ''Howard the Duck'' newspaper strip from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, later written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Alan Kupperberg]].

Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy when he became ''Howard the Duck'''s editor in addition to his writing duties (as evidenced by the credits on later issues), which was unusual for mass-market comics writers of the time, and the stories became increasingly experimental. At one point, unable to meet the deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer. One of those illustrated text pieces inspired Gerber's Vertigo series [[Nevada (comics)|''Nevada'']].

In 1978, the writer and publisher clashed over issues of creative control, and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. This was the first highly publicized "creator's rights" case in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to dramatize the case; these included ''[[Destroyer Duck]]'' with [[Jack Kirby]].

Disney also threatened to sue Marvel for infringing Donald Duck's copyright and enforced a different design, including the use of pants (as seen in the movie and some later comics)<ref>http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99564488180361.htm</ref>.

The series continued for four more issues with stories by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Mark Evanier]], and [[Bill Mantlo]]. Gerber returned briefly to write, though not plot, #29 as part of a contract fulfillment.

Issue #31, dated May 1979, announced on its letters page that it would be the final issue of ''Howard the Duck'' as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and [[Michael Golden]] and unrelated backup features by others; this series was canceled after nine issues.  Articles in these issues claimed that Howard was Mayerik's idea, though this is contrary to statements by both Gerber and Mayerik. The second story of issue #9, written by [[Steven Grant]], had Howard walk away from Beverly.  Grant followed this with a story in ''[[Bizarre Adventures]]'' #34, in which the suicidal Howard is put through a parody of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.

The original comic book series reappeared in early 1986 with issue #32, written by Grant. Issue #33, a parody of ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', written by Christopher Stager, appeared nine months later, along with a three-issue adaptation of the movie.

In a story rejected by Jim Shooter, Gerber explained that a [[Krylorian]] had made up the events in the Mantlo stories much like the events in ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'' magazine were considered made up, though those stories, as originally conceived, were intended to fill in material left by the publication gap between ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #6 and the Hulk's appearances in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]''.  Shooter considered this an insult to Mantlo (as well as to himself, as the story lampooned Shooter's ''[[Secret Wars]]''), not regarding the insult Mantlo's stories may have been to Gerber, and Gerber's story was never illustrated.  He also identified Howard's parents as Dave and Dottie, names that differ from the Mantlo and later DeMatteis stories.<ref>http://www.stevegerber.com/writings/scripts/index.php3</ref>

Gerber returned to Howard with ''[[Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' #5, around the same time he was writing a "Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck" crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was also scheduled to appear in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 2, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]], and issues of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' leading up to issue #25 and the ''[[Daydreamers]]'' miniseries by [[J.M. DeMatteis]].  Gerber was not pleased with this development, and decided to change the “unofficial crossover” somewhat.<ref>http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%e2%80%99s-not-like-you%e2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/</ref>
[[Image:Modern Howard the Duck.jpg|thumb|Promotional art for ''Howard the Duck'' #1 (2007), by [[Ty Templeton]] and [[Juan Bobillo]].]]

In the Spider-Man comic, Spider-Man and Howard meet two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the Savage Dragon comic, a villain creates hundreds of clones of Howard during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse with a character hidden in a bag, they reveal that they rescued the “real” Howard, while Spider-Man left with one of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed “Leonard the Duck,” which is now a character owned by Gerber, who went on to appear in [[Image Comics]] and [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] comics. Gerber considers this the real Howard, and Marvel's Howard an empty shell.

In 2001, when Marvel launched its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of "mature readers" comics, Gerber returned to write the six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]], illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and [[pop culture]] figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than would have been allowable 25 years earlier.  The series has Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a rat (possibly as a parody of Mickey Mouse, in retaliation for the earlier lawsuit), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' and several others. 

Howard had cameo appearances in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 1, #3 (February 2005) and vol. 2, #3/100 (February 2006, the 100th issue of all the various She-Hulk series). He returned in a series by writer [[Ty Templeton]] and artist [[Juan Bobillo]] in 2007.  This series is rated for all ages, though it has also been published with a [[Marvel Zombies]] tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim.

==Fictional character biography==
Howard is abducted from his native world and dropped into the [[Florida Everglades]] by the demonic [[Thog|Thog the Overmaster]] of the dread realm Sominus.<ref>''Marvel Treasury Edition'' #12 (1976)</ref> After five issues set in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Howard and Beverly Switzler take to the road, eventually ending up in [[New York City]], where Howard is nominated for [[U.S. president]] by the All-Night Party.  A doctored-photo scandal leads him to [[Canada]], and the defeat of a supervillain, Le Beaver, who falls to his death.  Howard then suffers a [[nervous breakdown]], and after the testimony of recurring foe, S. Blotte the Kidney Lady, he is sent to a [[mental institution]]. There he meets Winda Wester and is turned briefly into the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]].  Beverly and Paul Same (an artist for whom Beverly does nude modeling) get them both back to Cleveland. Later, while on a [[cruise ship]], Howard and Beverly are taken captive by the supervillain Doctor Bong, who marries Beverly against her will and transforms Howard into a human. After escaping back to New York and being restored to his natural form, Howard is hired as a dishwasher by Beverly's uncle and namesake, who goes by Lee.  After more adventures, he attends a party on [[Long Island]], where he is abducted by the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]] and his [[Circus of Crime]]. After defeating them, Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, goes his way alone, as he had at the beginning of the series.

Mantlo, beginning with Issue #30, returned the series to its former status quo, bringing Beverly back into the picture and having her divorce Doctor Bong, and getting Paul, who has been shot by the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], out of the hospital. Lee Switzler brings everyone back to Cleveland and employs Howard as a cab driver, while Paul, back to being a [[somnambulist]] after his release from the hospital, seems to have become Winda's boyfriend. At the end of the magazine series, Howard walks away from Beverly.  After that, he meets [[CeCe Ryder]] when [[hitchhiking]], and is later offered a genetically constructed mate whom he does not take to.

[[She-Hulk]] accidentally pulls him though a cosmic wormhole, and along with [[theoretical physicist]] [[Brent Wilcox]], they prevent other universes from crowding out [[Earth-616]].  By this point, Beverly is working as a rent-a-[[ninja]].

The sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]], in an attempt to return Howard to his home world, inadvertently teleports [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]] into her New York apartment. The disoriented dinosaur rampages through the city before being subdued by [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)]].

After meeting two mutants from [[X-Men]] mentor [[Charles Xavier]]'s [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], Howard and Beverly (apparently back together with Howard again working as a driver) spend some days at the Academy, becoming friends with the mutants Artie, Leech, [[Franklin Richards]], Synch and Chamber. During a battle with a rampaging [[Black Tom Cassidy]], Howard and some others escape with the help of the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Generation X'' #20-21, 23, 25 (Oct.-Nov. 1996, Jan. & March 1997)</ref>

Back with Beverley, he undergoes further shape-shifting experiments from Doctor Bong.

Sometime later, Howard attempts to register under the [[Superhero Registration Act]], but learns his socially disruptved life has created so many bureaucratic headaches that the government's policy is that Howard does not exist. This lack of government oversight delights him: "No more parking tickets, no taxes, no jury duty." In this story, as well, Howard says he was pressured to give up his cigars.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Choosing Sides]]'' #1 (Feb. 2006)</ref>

==Characters==
Howard the Duck, as his name suggests, is a three-foot-tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[duck]]. He generally wears a tie and shirt, and is almost always found smoking a [[cigar]]. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to [[Donald Duck]], and Marvel redesigned that aspect of character.

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude to the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, "Trapped in a world he never made", played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]]<!--the following is a presumption, and needs to be attributed to a critic, an editor, Gerber, etc.:  , but also reflected the sense of alienation that Howard shared with the majority of his readers-->. A common reaction to meeting Howard the first time is a startled, "You...you're a DUCK!"

His near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and [[Cleveland]] native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though she is a beautiful and sexy woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter) and Winda Wester (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ingénue with [[psychic]] powers); he has also worked with [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Man-Thing]] and associates on various occasions.

Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in "the Cosmic Axis". In the black-and-white ''Howard the Duck'' magazine series, writer [[Bill Mantlo]] theorized that Howard came from an [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional]] planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it "very pedestrian" and 'comic-booky' — in the worst sense of the term." He believes Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of cartoon animals.<ref>[http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3 "Mad Genius, Angry Fowl" Interview], Diamond Comic Distributors, 2001. Retrieved on 2007-04-06.</ref> A panel in ''Fear'' #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic rat and an anthropomorphic dog, in a hypothetical panel about other dimensions.

His antagonists, who usually appear in a single story each, are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, and sometimes political figures, but also include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, also known as [[Doctor Bong]] - modeled on [[Doctor Doom]] and writers [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]] - is a former [[tabloid]] reporter who has the power to "reorder reality" by smashing himself on his [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet; his main goal is to marry Beverly. After several issues, she agrees to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, and remains married to him for some time. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of ''[[She-Hulk]]'' and ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady (S. Blotte) who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]] and the [[Unification Church]] "Moonies". Another important villain was the Sinister S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring from Indecency) organization, whose leader was implicitly [[Anita Bryant]], though she looked like an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]] with a [[smiley face]]/[[orange (fruit)|orange]] on her head.

Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]. Also, [[Omega The Unknown]] appeared to him in a dream, as did Spider-Man, whom he had previously met for real, unlike Omega.

Seemingly an [[autodidact]], Howard at various times references [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Albert Camus]] (whose novel ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' Gerber considers the principal influence on the series<ref>http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99202219022753.htm</ref>), the [[Brontë]] sisters, and other figures of philosophical and political significance. In a parody of the Marvel comic character [[Shang-Chi]], he was trained in the art of ''Quak-Fu''. In the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking gesture toward Disney's mascot [[Mickey Mouse]], he was turned into various animals, primarily a [[mouse]].<ref>http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99564488180361.htm</ref>

==In other media==
*In [[1986 in film|1986]], [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Universal Pictures]] produced the movie ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'', starring [[Lea Thompson]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], [[Tim Robbins]], and, as the voice of Howard, [[Chip Zien]]. Besides Howard (who was portrayed by an assortment of stunt actors in a duck suit) the only character borrowed from the Marvel Comics mythos was Beverly Switzler, though in this version she was a rock singer. In the film, Howard is brought to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] by a laser experiment gone awry, which also summoned an evil alien called the [[Dark Overlord of the Universe]] who was intent on destroying the Earth.  The film was widely panned and was a [[box office bomb]]. 

*Howard the Duck was seen on [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s shirt on the animated series ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' (''The Phoenix Saga Part 2''). Aside from this, Howard never appeared in animation.

*In ''Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck'' #1 (Nov. 1996), Gerber claims that Howard and Beverly Switzler changed their names to Leonard the Duck and Rhonda Martini, remained in the Image Universe and "were last sighted in Chicago boarding the Amtrak for Buffalo" while the duck who returned to Marvel is "only an empty trademark, a clone whose soul departed him at the corner of Floss and Regret".<ref>"Fowl Play: the Behind-the Scenes Story of Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck #1 by Steve Gerber 1996</ref> This was done because [[Tom Brevoort]] invited Gerber to write the comic, claiming he was the only one to write Howard, then Gerber noticed the Howard guest appearances in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' and ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' and felt as though he had been tricked.<ref>[http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%e2%80%99s-not-like-you%e2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/ Stevegerblog] (Steve Gerber blog)</ref>

==Other versions==

*An alternate version of Howard the Duck appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #2-3, when the infected zombie duck is swiftly killed by [[Ash Williams]] of the [[Evil Dead series]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] after Howard ate the brains of that alternate-reality's Ash.

*Howard appears on a mid-1970s painted [[drinking glass]] from [[7-11]] [[convenience stores]].

===Toys===
A Howard the Duck action figure is sold together with [[Toy Biz]]'s Marvel Legends Series 5 [[Silver Surfer]] figure. The only such figure as of 2007, it uses the original, pant-less version of the character.

==In popular culture==
*In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s book ''[[The Transmigration of Timothy Archer]]'', published in 1982, one of the characters (Angel Archer) reads a current issue of ''Howard the Duck''.
*In [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[The Stand]]'', a character reads a ''Howard the Duck'' comic and is bewildered by the concept.  In the 1990 reissue of the book, the comic was changed to ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.
*On the rock band [[The Pretenders]]' first album, 1980s ''[[Pretenders (album)|Pretenders]]'', the song "Precious" contains a brief reference.  Songwriter [[Chrissie Hynde]], a native of Northeastern Ohio, uses Cleveland as the backdrop for the song, which includes the lines:
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Howard the Duck and Mr. Stress &nbsp;[''a long-time local bar band'' ]&nbsp; both stayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trapped in a world that they never made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not me, baby, I'm too precious.
</blockquote>
<!--This needs confirmation; it seems highly unlikely given character licensing rights that this was Howard the Duck in a DC cartoon. Also "toy variation" is vague -- what does that mean? *A toy variation of Howard the Duck appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Comfort and Joy".-->
*In the [[Kitchen Sink Press]] series ''[[Megaton Man]]'', a comedy relief character is '''Gower Goose''', who is an intended parody of Howard.
