'''Howard the Duck''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and artist [[Val Mayerik]].  Howard the Duck first appeared in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #19 ([[cover-date]]d Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, [[anthropomorphic]] "[[funny animal]]" trapped on a human-dominated Earth.

Howard's adventures are generally social [[satire]]s, while a few are [[parody|parodies]] of [[genre fiction]] with a [[metafiction]]al awareness of the medium.  The book is [[existentialist]], and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: "that life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view."<ref name=mediascene /> This is diametrically opposed to screenwriter [[Gloria Katz]], who, in adapting the comic to the screen, declared, "It's a film about a duck from outer space... It's not supposed to be an existential experience".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/foom/126874125950897.htm|title= F.O.O.M.

Howard the Duck was portrayed by Ed Gale and voiced by [[Chip Zien]] in the 1986 ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' film adaptation, and was later voiced by [[Seth Green]] in the films ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', both set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series (for the most part ditching the horror parodies), illustrated by a variety of artists, beginning with [[Frank Brunner]]. For Gerber, Howard was a flesh and blood duck and that, "if [[Wile E. Coyote]] gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt."<ref name=mediascene>{{cite journal|title = Where are the jokes?

Sporting the slogan "Get Down, America!", the All-Night Party was a fictional political party that appeared in Gerber's ''Howard the Duck'' series during the U.S. [[United States Presidential election, 1976|Presidential campaign of 1976]],<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 177: "Howard the Duck ended up being nominated as [a] presidential candidate!"</ref> and led to Howard the Duck receiving thousands of write-in votes in the actual election.<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Marvel attempted a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] with a short-lived ''Howard the Duck'' newspaper [[comic strip]] from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik,<ref name="CBAC3" /> later written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Alan Kupperberg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kupperberg_a.htm |title=Alan Kupperberg |first= |last= |date=May 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E9FTjFvu?url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kupperberg_a.htm |archivedate=February 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 2, 2013 |quote=In 1978 he took over the ''Howard the Duck'' weekly comic with Marv Wolfman. |df= }}</ref>

Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy when he became ''Howard the Duck'' 's editor in addition to his writing duties. With issue #16, unable to meet the deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/31464/ ''Howard the Duck'' #16] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

In 1978, the writer and publisher clashed over issues of creative control,<ref name=tcj41p7>{{cite journal|last = |first = |authorlink = |title = Marvel Fires Gerber|journal= The Comics Journal|issue = #41|page = 7|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = August 1978|location= Stamford, Connecticut<!--location in 1978-->}}</ref> and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. On August 29, 1980, after learning of Marvel's efforts to license Howard for use in film and broadcast media, Gerber filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marvel corporate parent Cadence Industries and other parties, alleging that he was the sole owner of the character.<ref name="Martin">{{cite web |url= http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/all-quacked-up-steve-gerber-marvel-comics-and-howard-the-duck/ |title= All Quacked-Up: Steve Gerber, Marvel Comics, and Howard the Duck|first= Robert Stanley|last= Martin|date= May 28, 2014|publisher= HoodedUtilitarian.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140529143308/http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/all-quacked-up-steve-gerber-marvel-comics-and-howard-the-duck/|archivedate= May 29, 2014|deadurl= yes|accessdate= June 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=HTDdocuments>{{cite web | url = http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/the-howard-the-duck-documents/|title=The Howard the Duck Documents| publisher=HoodedUtilitarian.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140529145709/http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/05/the-howard-the-duck-documents/|archivedate= May 29, 2014}}</ref> This was one of the first <!-- The Siegel and Shuster legal battle with DC Comics in the 1970s predates Gerber's battle with Marvel -->highly publicized [[creator's rights]] cases in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to fund a lawsuit against Marvel; these included ''[[Destroyer Duck]]'' with [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name="DAK38"/> The lawsuit was settled on September 24, 1982, with Gerber acknowledging that his work on the character was done as [[work-for-hire]] and that Marvel parent Cadence Industries owned "all right, title and interest" to Howard the Duck and the Howard material he had produced. On November 5, 1982, Judge [[David Vreeland Kenyon|David Kenyon]] approved the motion and dismissed the case.<ref name="Martin"/><ref name=HTDdocuments /><ref name="DAK38"/>

Around this time [[The Walt Disney Company]] threatened to sue Marvel for infringement of copyright claiming that Howard looked too similar to [[Donald Duck]] and enforced a different design, including the use of pants (as seen in the movie and some later comics).<ref name="Schroeder">{{cite web |url= http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99564488180361.htm |title= Steve Gerber: The Dark Duck Returns|first= Darren|last= Schroeder|date= July 20, 2001|publisher= SilverBulletComicBooks.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20020815054620/http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99564488180361.htm|archivedate=August 15, 2002 |deadurl= yes|accessdate= February 3, 2013}}</ref>

The series continued for four more issues with stories by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Mark Evanier]], and [[Bill Mantlo]]. Gerber returned briefly to write, though not plot, #29 as part of a contract fulfillment.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Issue #31 (May 1979) announced on its letters page that it would be the final issue of ''Howard the Duck'' as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]] and unrelated backup features by others; this series was canceled after nine issues.  Articles in these issues claimed that Howard was Mayerik's idea, though this is contrary to statements by both Gerber and Mayerik. In issue #6, Mantlo introduced the concept of "Duckworld", which Gerber loathed.  It depicted an all-duck parallel Earth in which there were duck equivalents of famous people, such as "Ducktor Strange" (a parody of [[Doctor Strange]]) who later appeared in ''[[She-Hulk|The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' (#19) and Truman Capoultry ([[Truman Capote]]), who narrated the issue.  As Gerber told ''[[Mediascene]]'': "Howard's world, which would never be depicted visually, was inhabited by other anthropomorphized animals like himself. Like the cartoon worlds of Disney and Warner Brothers. Unlike the Disney and Warners worlds, however, Howard's reality was beset with the same plethora of social ills and personal vicissitudes which human beings confront daily. And the same, or similar, laws of nature applied there, too."<ref name=mediascene />  The first story of issue #9, written by [[Bill Mantlo]], had Howard walk away from [[Beverly Switzler]], and what happened to him next was documented in a story by [[Steve Skeates]] in the same issue.  [[Steven Grant]] followed this with a story in ''[[Bizarre Adventures]]'' #34, in which the suicidal Howard is put through a parody of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.

The original comic book series reappeared in early 1986 with issue #32, written by Grant. Grant had in fact written the story as a topical humor piece four years before, and as a result the jokes were outdated at the time it was published.<ref name="DAK38">{{cite news | author = Zimmerman, Dwight Jon | date = September 1986 | title = Steve Gerber (part 2) | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 38 | pages = 6–19 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> Issue #33, a parody of ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', written by Christopher Stager, appeared nine months later, along with a three-issue adaptation of the movie. A text article in ''Howard the Duck'' #33 explained that [[Harvey Pekar]], himself a Cleveland resident, was mentioned as a possible writer for that issue, but he was unavailable and nothing came of it.

Issue #32 was originally written by Gerber.<ref name="DAK38"/> In the story, Gerber explained that "a [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]] [[Cyndi Lauper]]"<!--comparison made in the script--> named Chirreep had made up the events in the Mantlo stories much like the events in ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'' magazine were considered made up by [[Bereet]]. Marvel's then-[[editor-in-chief]] [[Jim Shooter]] considered this an insult to Mantlo and Gerber's story was never published.  He identified Howard's parents as Dave and Dotty, names that differ from the Mantlo stories, in which his parents are named Ronald and Henrietta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevegerber.com/writings/scripts/index.php3|first= Steve|last= Gerber|title=Scripts: The Unpublished ''Duck'' |publisher=SteveGerber.com|year= 2001|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120324092101/http://www.stevegerber.com/writings/scripts/index.php3|archivedate=March 24, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= June 4, 2012|quote= Unfortunately, the then-editor-in-chief of Marvel requested changes in the story which I found unacceptable. As a result, I pulled the script, and it was never published.}}</ref> Gerber's script lampooned ''[[Secret Wars]]'', written by Jim Shooter, but Shooter has denied this played any role in choosing to reject the story, insisting that he only took issue with the insults to Mantlo.<ref>{{cite web|first= Jim|last= Shooter|authorlink = Jim Shooter|url=http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/08/gerber-and-duck-part-2.html|title=Gerber and the Duck – Part 2|publisher=Jim Shooter|date= August 2, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130101214856/http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/08/gerber-and-duck-part-2.html|archivedate=January 1, 2013 |deadurl= no|accessdate= June 4, 2012}}</ref>

Gerber brought back Howard in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' #14–17, again living with Beverly, now working as a rent-a-[[ninja]].  How they got back together is never explained and Beverly is not involved in the story as the She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from [[Empire State University]].

Gerber returned to Howard with ''[[Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' #5, around the same time he was writing a "[[Savage Dragon]]/Destroyer Duck" crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was scheduled to appear in ''[[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]], and issues of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' leading up to issue #25 and the ''[[Daydreamers (comics)|Daydreamers]]'' miniseries by [[J.M. DeMatteis]].  Gerber was not pleased with this development, and changed the "unofficial crossover" somewhat.<ref name="Gerber2007">{{cite web |url=  http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%e2%80%99s-not-like-you%e2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/|title= …and it's not like you're going to read about it on the Steve Gerber Web site|first= Steve|last= Gerber|date= January 17, 2007|publisher= SteveGerberBlog|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013040916/http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%E2%80%99s-not-like-you%E2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/|archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl= yes|accessdate= February 3, 2013}}</ref>

In ''Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5, [[Spider-Man]], Beverly and Howard meet the [[Elf with a Gun]] and two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, grab a disc, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the ''Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck'' crossover comic, Elf with a Gun creates thousands of clones of Howard and Beverly during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse, they reveal that they rescued the "real" Howard and Beverly, while Spider-Man left with two of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed "Leonard the Duck", and Beverly has her hair dyed black and is renamed "Rhonda Martini". They made just one more appearance afterward, in a single-panel cameo in ''[[Vertigo Winter's Edge]]'' #2.  Gerber considered this the real Howard and Marvel's Howard an empty shell.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2001, when Marvel launched its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of "mature readers" comics, Gerber returned to write the six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]], illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and [[popular culture|pop culture]] figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier.  The series has [[Doctor Bong]] causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of [[Mickey Mouse]], in retaliation for the earlier lawsuit), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with [[God]] in [[Hell]].

Howard had cameo appearances in ''She-Hulk'' (vol. 2) #9 (Feb. 2005) and #3/100 (Feb. 2006, the 100th issue of all the various She-Hulk series). He returned in ''Howard the Duck'' (vol. 4) #1-4, a miniseries by writer [[Ty Templeton]] and artist [[Juan Bobillo]], in 2007.  This series was rated for ages 9 and up, though one issue was published with a ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim.

In November 2014, Marvel announced an ongoing series starting in March 2015 featuring Howard as a [[private investigator]] on Earth. The creative team will be writer [[Chip Zdarsky]] and artist Joe Quinones.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newsarama.com/22800-marvel-s-howard-the-duck-to-get-new-ongoing-series.html|title= Marvel's ''Howard the Duck'' To Get New Ongoing Series|first= Lucas|last= Siegel|date= November 21, 2014|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141123205654/http://www.newsarama.com/22800-marvel-s-howard-the-duck-to-get-new-ongoing-series.html|archivedate= November 23, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Back to New York===
Howard returned to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard managed to recover the necklace. But on his way to give it back to Richards, he found himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain's collection. Upon returning to Earth, he confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him, after he was robbed by [[Aunt May|May Parker]], Spider-Man's aunt. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard was approached by Richards in the middle of his fight against the Ringmaster and Richards revealed himself to be Talos the Untamed, who revealed that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara located the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but were unable to put it all together when Talos grabbed it, who proceeded to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos was confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara took cover. He was able to point out that Tara, who revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a [[Skrull]], could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt ([[Super-Skrull]]), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand.

Howard has no superhuman powers, but he is skilled in the martial art known as Quak-Fu, enough to defeat, or at least to hold his own against, far larger opponents.

On one occasion, Howard used a suit of powered armor known as the "Iron Duck" armor designed by Claude Starkowitz. Besides its property as body armor, the suit was equipped with foot-mounted leaping coils, a chest-mounted searchlight, and flamethrowers in both arms.<ref name="HtD30" />

Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to [[Donald Duck]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-121/|title= Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #121|first= Brian|last= Cronin|date= September 20, 2007|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121010192806/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-121/|archivedate=October 10, 2012 |deadurl= no |accessdate= February 2, 2013|quote= Disney did, in fact, threaten to sue Marvel over the appearance of Howard the Duck}}</ref> and Marvel redesigned that aspect of the character by writing into the script that Howard was the target of anti-nudity protests, and was forced to do business with "Wally Sidney", a failed cartoonist who made his fortune through a chain of conservative clothing retailers known as "Sidney World". Howard tries on various outfits, to include ones akin to Donald Duck's sailor uniform and [[Uncle Scrooge]]'s coat and [[top hat]] before settling on his new attire of a business suit complete with trousers. Although Howard sulks that he has lost, Beverly reassures him that she does not want him to be a victim of a mob, and loves him no matter what he wears.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Colan, Gene|inker= Janson, Klaus|story= Animal Indecency!|title= Howard the Duck|volume= 2|issue= #2|date= December 1979}}</ref>

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude to the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, "Trapped in a world he never made", played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]]<!--the following is a presumption, and needs to be attributed to a critic, an editor, Gerber, etc.: , but reflected the sense of alienation that Howard shared with the majority of his readers-->. A common reaction to meeting Howard the first time is a startled, "You...you're a DUCK!"

His near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and [[Cleveland]] native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though she is a beautiful and sexy woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter named the Winky Man) and Winda Wester (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ingénue with [[psychic]] powers); he has worked with [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Man-Thing]] and associates on various occasions.

Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in "the Cosmic Axis" from a world similar to Earth, but where there are "more ducks" and "apes don't talk". In the black-and-white ''Howard the Duck'' magazine series, writer [[Bill Mantlo]] theorized that Howard came from an [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional]] planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it "very pedestrian" and 'comic-booky' — in the worst sense of the term." He believes Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of cartoon animals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|title= Mad Genius, Angry Fowl|first= Nate|last= Shelton|date= November 2001|publisher= Diamond Previews Online|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304034542/http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3|archivedate=March 4, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= April 6, 2007|quote= The title character was no super-hero; he was just a cantankerous little guy named Howard who was, in the words of his creator, "the living embodiment of all that is querulous, opinionated, and uncool"…and happened to hail from an alternate Earth populated by "funny" cartoon animals.}}</ref> A panel in ''Fear'' #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic mouse and an anthropomorphic dog, in a hypothetical panel about other dimensions.  [[Destroyer Duck]] was depicted existing in such a world, and in ''Howard the Duck'' (vol. 2) #6, Howard mentions that [[Moses]] is believed to be a [[moose]] in his world and [[Jesus|Yeshua]] a [[flying squirrel]].

His antagonists, who usually appear in a single story each, are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, and sometimes political figures, but include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, better known as [[Doctor Bong]] – modeled on [[Doctor Doom]] and writers [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]] – is a former [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporter who has the power to "reorder reality" by smashing himself on the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet on his head; his main goal is to marry Beverly. After several issues, she agrees to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, and remains married to him for some time. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of ''[[She-Hulk]]'' and ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady (S. Blotte) who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]] and the [[Unification Church]] ("Moonies"). Another important villain was the organization S.O.O.F.I. ('''S'''ave '''O'''ur '''O'''ffspring '''F'''rom '''I'''ndecency), whose leader was implied in the story to be [[Anita Bryant]], though she looked like an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]] with a [[smiley|smiley face]]/[[orange (fruit)|orange]] on her head.

Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared, including [[Spider-Man]], the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]. [[Omega the Unknown]] appeared to him in a dream, as did the founding members of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] and Spider-Man, whom he had previously met for real, unlike Omega.

Seemingly an [[autodidact]], Howard at various times references [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Albert Camus]] (whose novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' Gerber considers the principal influence on the comic series),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|title= Steve Gerber: An Absurd Journey Part I |first= Darren|last= Schroeder|date= June 7, 2001|publisher= SilverBulletComicBooks.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121130214049/http://comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3845/steve-gerber-an-absurd-journey-part-i/|archivedate=November 30, 2012 |deadurl= yes|accessdate= February 3, 2013|quote= I suppose that would be Albert Camus's ''The Stranger'', which I encountered my first or second year of college.

In a parody of the Marvel comic character [[Shang-Chi]], he was trained in the martial art of Quak-Fu. In the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking gesture toward Disney's mascot [[Mickey Mouse]], he was turned into various animals, primarily a [[mouse]].<ref name="Schroeder" />

Rose|Tim Rose]], Steve Sleap, Lisa Sturz, and Mary Wells. The only character borrowed from the Marvel Comics mythos was Beverly Switzler, though this version was a rock singer. In the film, Howard is brought to [[Cleveland]] by a laser spectroscope experiment gone awry which additionally summoned an evil alien, one of the Dark Overlords of the Universe, who intended to sacrifice all human life in order to free the others of its kind from their celestial prison.

===Newspaper comic strip===
Between June 1977 and October 1978, Howard the Duck appeared in a syndicated daily comic strip that comic strip historian [[Allan Holtz]] has described as having low distribution and that was eventually replaced by the ''[[Hulk in other media#Syndicated comic strip|Hulk]]'' strip.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2010/01/obscurity-of-day-howard-duck.html|title= Obscurity of the Day: Howard the Duck|first= Allan|last= Holtz|date= January 27, 2010|publisher= Stripper's Guide|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309201726/http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2010/01/obscurity-of-day-howard-duck.html|archivedate=March 9, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= June 4, 2012|quote= The newspaper strip version began on June 6, 1977 at the height of Howard-mania. At first Steve Gerber and Gene Colan, the creative team on the comic book, handled the strip as well. Colan, however, dropped out after just five months, and his job was taken over by [[Val Mayerik]], who was occasionally spelling Colan on the comic book.}}</ref> Among the handful of newspapers it appeared in (syndicated by the [[Register and Tribune Syndicate]]) were the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' and ''[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]''. A total of eleven story arcs, as well as a number of single-joke strips, constitute the 511 individual strips that were printed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemsworld.com/howard/ |title='&#39;Howard the Duck'&#39; strip listing and compilation|publisher=Nemsworld.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141017184058/http://www.nemsworld.com/howard/|archivedate= October 17, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= June 4, 2012}}</ref>

The strip started with original stories written by Steve Gerber and illustrated by Gene Colan: "Pop Syke", "The Cult of the Entropy" and "The Self Made Man". The latter was started by Colan and completed by [[Val Mayerik]], who stayed on to do two additional Gerber scripted stories: "The Sleigh Jacking" and "In Search of the Good Life".

These were followed by an adaptation of the "Sleep of the Just" story from issue #4 of the Marvel comic, scripted by Gerber and illustrated by Alan Kupperberg. Colan's departure (and eventually Gerber's) grew out of escalating disagreements fueled by a dispute with Marvel over the delay in payment for work on the strip.<ref name="CBAC3">{{cite book|last = Cooke|first = Jon B.|chapter=Steve Gerber's Crazy Days|title = Comic Book Artist Collection, Vol. 3|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date = April 2005|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|page = 66|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F9bAN1DE7igC&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=newspapers+that+carried+the+howard+the+duck+comic+strip&source=bl&ots=Lej5BynvRM&sig=N6GKRstADpB7NHvGzwIqROs4L3s&hl=en&ei=F7WTTfuEF4i-sQPtka3BBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn = 978-1893905429}}</ref>  Gerber was replaced by Marv Wolfman as writer while Alan Kupperberg continued as artist. The remaining stories were: "Close Encounters of the Fowl Kind", "The Tuesday Ruby", "The Clone Ranger", "The Mystery of the Maltese Human" and "Howard Heads Home". As the series drew to an end, its already meager list of client papers shrank, making copies of these last post-Gerber stories particularly hard to find.

In November 1978, the first of a projected eight-issue series reprinting the entire strip was published by John Zawadzki. Titled ''It's Adventure Time with Howard the Duck'', only the initial issue was published.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 7018|title= ''It's Adventure Time With....Howard the Duck''}}</ref>

===Radio===
In 1980, a pilot for a radio show version of Howard was recorded. [[James Belushi]] played the role of Howard.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DCUEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PT20&ots=0RaRMS1_vC&dq=howard%20the%20duck%20radio%20show&pg=PT20#v=onepage&q=howard%20the%20duck%20radio%20show&f=false "Belushi Voice"], ''Billboard'', October 4, 1980, page 21</ref>
