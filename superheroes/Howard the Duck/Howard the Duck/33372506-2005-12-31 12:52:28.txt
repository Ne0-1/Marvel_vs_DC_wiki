'''Howard the Duck''' is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character]] created by [[Steve Gerber]] for [[Marvel Comics]] and featured in several comic book series of the same name. Howard's adventures are generally [[parody|parodies]] of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]&mdash;usually set in mundane surroundings such as [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]&mdash;written in a tongue-in-cheek style and combined with a degree of [[metafiction]]al awareness of the limitations of the medium, often very experimental for a non-[[underground comics|underground]] comic.

There was a [[film]] adaptation with the same title in 1986.

==Publication history==
Howard the Duck was created in 1973 by Gerber (with artist [[Val Mayerik]] designing Howard's original look) in the comic book ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'', as a secondary character in that comic's "[[Man-Thing]]" story. In his appearances with Man-Thing, Howard confronted bizarre horror-parody characters such as the Hellcow and the Man-Frog.

He acquired his own comic book title with ''Howard the Duck'' #1 in 1976. Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series, illustrated by a variety of artists, with [[Gene Colan]] eventually becoming the regular [[penciller]]. The series gradually developed a substantial [[cult following]], possibly amplified by Howard's entry into the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. presidential campaign]] under the auspices of the [[All-Night Party]] (an event later immortalized in a brief reference in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Tommyknockers]]''). Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived ''Howard the Duck'' newspaper strip from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, later written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Alan Kupperberg]].

Due to ''Howard the Duck'' being one of Marvel's few non-[[superhero]] titles, and Gerber's status as one of Marvel's better-known and most unusual writers from his earlier work on ''Man-Thing'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy that was unusual for mass-market comics writers of the time, and the stories became increasingly dark and experimental. At one point, unable to meet deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer.

In 1978, the writer and publisher clashed over issues of creative control, and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. This was the first highly-publicized "creator's rights" case in comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to dramatize the case; these included ''[[Destroyer Duck]]'' with [[Jack Kirby]] (Kirby himself helped pave the way for creator-owned comics with his series ''Captain Victory'') and ''Stewart the Rat'' with Gene Colan. 

The series continued for four more issues with stories by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Mark Evanier]], and [[Bill Mantlo]] (Gerber returned briefly to write, though not plot, #29), but fans of the original series did not respond well to the loss of Gerber. Marvel then re-launched ''Howard the Duck'' in 1979 as a bimonthly magazine&mdash;an unusual format for mass-market comics at the time&mdash;with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan as well as [[Michael Golden]], and unrelated backup features by others; this series was cancelled after nine issues. Issue #32, written by Steven Grant, appeared in early 1986; #33, by Christopher Stager, some nine months later, along with a three-issue adaptation of the movie.

''Howard the Duck'' #1-27 and other Gerber-written ''Howard the Duck'' stories have been reprinted by Marvel in a paperback collection, ''The Essential Howard the Duck'' (ISBN 0785108319).

In 2001, with Marvel under new management and launching its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of "mature readers" comics, Gerber returned to his former publisher to write a six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]], illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters and, like the original series, parodying a wide range of other comics and [[pop culture]] figures&mdash;but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than would have been allowable 25 years earlier&mdash;the series (collected in ISBN 0785109315) was generally well reviewed.

==Characters==
Howard, as his name suggests, is a three-foot-tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[humanoid]] [[duck]] from another dimension (populated by his own kind) who finds himself on Earth due to a shift in "the Cosmic Axis". He wears a tie and shirt, and is almost always found smoking a [[cigar]]. It is implied (through taglines and various references) that, in his own dimension, Howard had been a scholar - the writers, at various times, reference [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the [[BrontÃ«]] sisters, and other figures of philosophical and political significance. In a parody of the Marvel comic character [[Shang-Chi]], he was trained in the art of ''Quak-Fu''. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; after [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to [[Donald Duck]], Marvel redesigned the character so that Howard now wears pants. Howard was once briefly transformed into a human being, and in the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking response to Disney's complaints, he turned into various animals including (ironically) a mouse.

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude to the often bizarre events around him; there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and he has no goals but comfort and to be left alone, but he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, "Trapped in a world he never made," played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]], but also reflected the sense of alienation that Howard shared with the majority of his readers.

His constant companion is former art model and Cleveland native '''Beverly Switzler'''. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though she is a beautiful woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are '''Paul Same''' (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter) and '''Winda Wester''' (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ingenue with [[psychic]] powers).

His antagonists, who usually appeared in only one story each, are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, and sometimes political figures, but also include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde a.k.a. [[Doctor Bong]]&mdash;modelled on [[Doctor Doom]], [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]]&mdash;is a former [[tabloid]] reporter who has the power to "reorder reality" by smashing himself on his [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet; his main goal is to marry Beverly.  After several issues, she agrees to marry him to save Howard from his evil experimentation, and remains married to him for some time. Doctor Bong would reappear in several issues of [[She-Hulk]] and [[Deadpool]] in the mid-1990s.

Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]].

==Other Media==
In 1986, [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Universal Pictures]] produced the movie '''''Howard the Duck''''', starring [[Lea Thompson]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Tim Robbins]]. In the film, Howard was brought to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] by a laser experiment gone awry, which also summoned an evil alien spirit called a [[Dark Overlord of the Universe]] intent on destroying the Earth; besides Howard (who was portrayed by an assortment of stunt actors in a duck suit), the only character borrowed from the comic book was Beverly Switzler, though in this version she became a rock singer. It was widely panned and was a [[box office bomb]], but it renewed enough attention on the character for Marvel Comics to keep using the character on occasion. It is considered by many as one of the top 100 [[List of films that have been considered the worst ever|worst films]] ever made. The character of Beverly was originally offered to then-unknown singer [[Tori Amos]], but the offer was retracted when Thompson expressed interest. At the time Amos was the lead singer in a rock band.

Howard the Duck was seen on [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s shirt on the animated series of ''X-men the Phoenix saga part 2''.

==Trivia==
* This film is acknowledged to be [[George Lucas]]' biggest [[box office]] bomb thus far.  [[George Lucas|Lucas]] disowned the film shortly after its release. Ironically enough, "Howard The Duck" is featured on his website for [[LucasFilm]] in the category of other films that he and his studio have worked on [http://www.lucasfilm.com/films/other/duck.html].
