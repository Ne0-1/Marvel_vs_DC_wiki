'''Howard the Duck''' is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]] created by writer [[Steve Gerber]] and artist [[Val Mayerik]].  The character first appeared in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #19 (Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, [[anthropomorphic]], "[[funny animal]]" trapped on human-dominated Earth.  Howard's adventures are generally social [[satire]]s, and also often [[parody|parodies]] of [[genre fiction]] with a [[metafiction]]al awareness of the medium.

==Publication history==
Howard the Duck was created in 1973 by Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' as a secondary character in that comic's ''[[Man-Thing]]'' feature.  He graduated to his own backup feature in ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'', confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as the Hellcow and the Man-Frog, before acquiring his own comic book title with ''Howard the Duck'' #1 in 1976.

Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series, illustrated by a variety of artists, beginning with [[Frank Brunner]], who left because he considered Howard a [[cartoon]] in the real world, which Gerber did not, with [[Gene Colan]] eventually becoming the regular [[penciller]]. The series gradually developed a substantial [[cult following]], possibly amplified by Howard's entry into the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. presidential campaign]] under the auspices of the [[All-Night Party]] (an event later immortalized in a brief reference in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Tommyknockers]]''). Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived ''Howard the Duck'' newspaper strip from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, later written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Alan Kupperberg]].

Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy when he became ''Howard the Duck'''s editor in addition to his writing duties (as evidenced by the credits on later issues), which was unusual for mass-market comics writers of the time, and the stories became increasingly experimental. At one point, unable to meet the deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer. One of those illustrated text pieces inspired Gerber's Vertigo series [[Nevada (comics)|''Nevada'']].

In 1978, the writer and publisher clashed over issues of creative control, and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. This was the first highly publicized [[creator's rights]] case in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to dramatize the case; these included ''[[Destroyer Duck]]'' with [[Jack Kirby]].

Disney also threatened to sue Marvel for infringing Donald Duck's copyright and enforced a different design, including the use of pants (as seen in the movie and some later comics).<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99564488180361.htm Steve Gerber: The Dark Duck Returns: Interviews & Features Archive - Comics Bulletin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The series continued for four more issues with stories by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Mary Skrenes]], [[Mark Evanier]], and [[Bill Mantlo]]. Gerber returned briefly to write, though not plot, #29 as part of a contract fulfillment.  [[Harvey Pekar]], himself a Cleveland resident, was mentioned as a possible replacement for Gerber, but he was unavailable, and nothing came of it.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #33</ref>

Issue #31, dated May 1979, announced on its letters page that it would be the final issue of ''Howard the Duck'' as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and [[Michael Golden]] and unrelated backup features by others; this series was canceled after nine issues.  Articles in these issues claimed that Howard was Mayerik's idea, though this is contrary to statements by both Gerber and Mayerik (it would, however, conform to the "Marvel way" of comics creation--art first--akin to Kirby's creation of [[Silver Surfer]] without initial input from [[Stan Lee]]). The first story of issue #9, written by [[Bill Mantlo]], had Howard walk away from Beverly, and what happened to him next was documented in a story by [[Steve Skeates]] the same issue.  [[Steven Grant]] followed this with a story in ''[[Bizarre Adventures]]'' #34, in which the suicidal Howard is put through a parody of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.

The original comic book series reappeared in early 1986 with issue #32, written by Grant. Issue #33, a parody of ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', written by Christopher Stager, appeared nine months later, along with a three-issue adaptation of the movie.

In a story rejected by [[Jim Shooter]], Marvel's then-[[editor-in-chief]], Gerber explained that a [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]] [[Cyndi Lauper]]<!--comparison made in the script--> named Chirreep had made up the events in the Mantlo stories much like the events in ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'' magazine were considered made up by [[Bereet]], though those stories, as originally conceived, were intended to fill in material left by the publication gap between ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #6 and the Hulk's appearances in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]''.  Shooter considered this an insult to Mantlo (as well as to himself, as the story lampooned Shooter's ''[[Secret Wars]]''), not regarding the insult Mantlo's stories may have been to Gerber (Mantlo himself had used the Krylorians to erase [[Doug Moench]]'s contributions to the Hulk's continuity), and Gerber's story was never illustrated.  He also identified Howard's parents as Dave and Dotty, names that differ from the Mantlo stories, in which his parents are named Ronald and Henrietta.<ref>[http://www.stevegerber.com/writings/scripts/index.php3 SteveGerber.com - Scripts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Gerber brought back Howard in ''[[The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #14-17, again living with Beverly, now working as a rent-a-[[ninja]].  How they got back together is never explained, and Beverly is not involved as She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from [[Empire State University]].

Gerber returned to Howard with ''[[Spider-Man Team-Up]]'' #5, around the same time he was writing a "[[Savage Dragon]]/Destroyer Duck" crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was also scheduled to appear in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]], and issues of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' leading up to issue #25 and the ''[[Daydreamers]]'' miniseries by [[J.M. DeMatteis]].  Gerber was not pleased with this development, and changed the "unofficial crossover" somewhat.<ref>http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%e2%80%99s-not-like-you%e2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/</ref>
[[Image:Modern Howard the Duck.jpg|thumb|Promotional art for ''Howard the Duck'' #1 (2007), by [[Ty Templeton]] and [[Juan Bobillo]].]]

In the Spider-Man comic, Spider-Man and Howard meet two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the Savage Dragon comic, a villain creates hundreds of clones of Howard during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse with a character hidden in a bag, they reveal that they rescued the “real” Howard, while Spider-Man left with one of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed “Leonard the Duck,” which is now a character owned by Gerber, who went on to appear in [[Image Comics]] and [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] comics. Gerber considers this the real Howard, and Marvel's Howard an empty shell.

In 2001, when Marvel launched its [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint of "mature readers" comics, Gerber returned to write the six-issue ''Howard the Duck'' [[miniseries]], illustrated by [[Phil Winslade]] and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar ''Howard the Duck'' characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and [[pop culture]] figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier.  The series has Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a rat (possibly as a parody of Mickey Mouse, in retaliation for the earlier lawsuit), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with [[God]] in [[Hell]]. 

Howard had cameo appearances in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' #3 (Feb. 2005) and vol. 2, #3/100 (Feb. 2006, the 100th issue of all the various She-Hulk series). He returned in a series by writer [[Ty Templeton]] and artist [[Juan Bobillo]] in 2007.  This series is rated for all ages, though it has also been published with a [[Marvel Zombies]] tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim.

==Fictional character biography==

There he battles Garko the Man-Frog <ref>''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #4</ref>, after which he is arrested for [[disturbing the peace]] and mistaken for a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] during a [[strip search]].  Upon release (because the officer fears he has mutant abilities that could be used against him), he encounters a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)#Known Vampires|vampire]] cow, Bessie the Hellcow.<ref>''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #5</ref> 

Howard soon meets artists' model Beverly Switzler and a bizarre series of encounters follows.

Howard and Beverely hit the road, seeking shelter in a gothic mansion where they battle an animated Gingerbread Man.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #6-7</ref> They eventually end up in [[New York City]], where Howard is nominated for [[U.S. president]] by the [[All-Night Party]].<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #7</ref>  Howard battles the [[Band of the Bland]] — Dr. Angst, Sitting Bullseye, Tillie the Hun, the Spanker, and Black Hole — alongside the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Marvel Treasury'' #12</ref>  A doctored-photo scandal leads him to [[Canada]], and the defeat of a supervillain, Le Beaver, who falls to his death.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #9</ref> Howard then suffers a [[nervous breakdown]], and flees Bev and their situation on a bus. Unfortunately, the passengers are all believers in various weird cults, and try to interest Howard in them. His seatmates are Winda Wester (afflicted with an Elmer Fudd-like speech impediment) and S. Blotte the Kidney Lady. After the bus crashes, Howard and Winda are sent to a [[mental institution]]. There he meets Daimon Hellstrom, and is briefly possessed by Hellstrom's demonic soul, becoming the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]].<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #10-14</ref>  Beverly and Paul get them both back to Cleveland. Later, while on a [[cruise ship]] returning from scenic Bagmom, Howard and Beverly are taken captive by Lester Verde, who had a crush on Beverly in college and is now in the identity of the supervillain Doctor Bong,<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #15</ref> who illegally marries Beverly against her will and transforms Howard into a human.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #18-19</ref> After escaping back to New York and being restored to his natural form, Howard is hired as a dishwasher by Beverly's uncle and namesake, who goes by Lee.  Howard battles Sudd,<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #20</ref> and then battles Soofi.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #21</ref> Howard is then reunited with the Man-Thing, Korrek, and Jennifer Kale, and they all battle Bzzk'Joh.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #22-23</ref> He then attends a party on [[Long Island]], where he is abducted by the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]] and his [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #25-27</ref> After defeating them, Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, goes his way alone, as he had at the beginning of the series.

Mantlo, beginning with Issue #30, returned the series to its former status quo, bringing Beverly back into the picture and having her divorce Doctor Bong, and getting Paul, who has been shot by the Ringmaster, out of the hospital. Lee Switzler brings everyone back to Cleveland and employs Howard as a cab driver, while Paul, back to being a [[somnambulist]] after his release from the hospital, seems to have become Winda's boyfriend. Howard dons a suit of "Iron Duck" armor, and battles Doctor Bong.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #30-31</ref> He later battles Morton Erg and the Gopher.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' #32</ref> He encountered [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]],<ref>''Howard the Duck Magazine'' #5</ref> and even returns to Duckworld at one point.<ref>''Howard the Duck Magazine'' #6</ref> At the end of the magazine series, Howard walks away from Beverly (at her request).  After that, he is mistaken for "Duck Drake, Private Eye", meets [[CeCe Ryder]] when [[hitchhiking]], and is later offered a genetically constructed mate whom he does not take to.

[[She-Hulk]] accidentally pulls him though a cosmic wormhole, and along with [[theoretical physicist]] [[Brent Wilcox]], they prevent other universes from crowding out [[Earth-616]].  By this point, Beverly is working as a rent-a-[[ninja]]. Howard met the Critic, and traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and his cohorts.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #14-16</ref>

In an encounter with [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], [[Ben Reilly]] (then-current Spider-Man), and a rematch with the [[Circus of Crime]], Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting [[Savage Dragon]] and [[Destroyer Duck]].  The group leaves the warehouse believing that they have brought the correct Howard with them.<ref>''Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5</ref>

The sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]], in a weekly attempt to return Howard (a Howard with [[stubble]] who accuses her and [[Doctor Strange]] of being responsible for bringing him to this world) to his home world, inadvertently teleports [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon Boy]] into her New York apartment. The disoriented dinosaur attempts to eat Howard, but spits him out when shot with [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]]'s hellfire gun, then rampages through the city before being subdued by [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)]]. Howard relates to the pair being trapped in a world he never made, and wanders off.<ref>''[[Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 3 #81-82</ref>

===[[Heroes Reborn]]===
After giving a ride from the western desert and becoming involved in an anti-mutant bar brawl with [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and [[Skin (comics)|Skin]], assisting the mutants with his knowledge of Quack-Fu, Howard and Beverly (apparently back together with Howard again working as a driver) spend [[Thanksgiving]] at [[Charles Xavier]]'s [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]].  Chamber, however, is celebrating Thanksgiving with [[Husk (comics)|Husk]]'s family, and the young mutants [[Artie Maddicks]], [[Leech (comics)|Leech]], and [[Franklin Richards]] are intrigued by the pair, inviting Beverly and dragging Howard to a [[treehouse]] where they have hidden the visiting [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] [[Tana Nile]]. Working as a video store clerk in Cleveland, Beverly gets him to play a department store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the [[North Pole]], where [[Santa Claus]] has sold out to [[HYDRA]].  Some time after Christmas, Howard returns alone to his friends' treehouse, and during a battle with a rampaging [[Black Tom Cassidy]], the group escapes with the apparent help of the [[Man-Thing]].<ref>''Generation X'' #20-21, 23,  ''Howard the Duck Holiday Special!'' #1, ''Generation X'' #25 (Oct.-Nov. 1996, Jan. , Feb., March 1997)</ref>  Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially [[Ward Cleaver|Ward]] and [[June Cleaver]], has a sister named Princess, and is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].  This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly.<ref>''Daydreamers'' 1-3</ref>  When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp.  While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the [[Cult of Entropy]], who wrapped him in [[swaddling clothes]].<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #5</ref>  Although we last saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane.  The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during [[Heroes Reborn]], inside him, which he knows because it is making him [[nauseous]].  Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead.<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #6</ref> He then encountered [[Namor]], who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains that he would not be lugging his friend's body if that were the case.  Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor.  Once he sees that Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says he is returning to Cleveland.<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #7</ref>

Back with Beverly, he undergoes further shape-shifting experiments from Doctor Bong.  Beverly is hired by Verde's Globally Branded Content Corporation, which manufactures [[boy band]]s from protein vats based on the [[sexual arousal]] of a [[focus group]] of [[gay men]].  Attempting to destroy an escapee whom Beverly has taken in, Bong inadvertantly knocks Howard into a vat, which changes him, unstably, into a mouse<ref>''Howard the Duck'' vol. 2 #1</ref>--showering changes his form multiple times.  Verde then goes to the press and claims that his building was attacked by Osama el-Barka ("Osama the Duck" in Arabic).  Howard and Beverly are sent back on the road after the [[junkyard]] office where they are living is destroyed by a [[S.W.A.T.]] team.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' vol, 2 #2</ref>  Denied admittance to every possible shelter due to lack of funds, the pair and their dog find a sign for the Boarding [[House of Mystery]], but are taken to the police station for questioning and [[strip search]]es by Suzy [[Pazuzu]], with whom Beverly had attended high school.  One of the officers on the case is the same beat cop who mistook Howard for a mutant many years before.  Suzy is the inheritor of the [[douche]]blade, which starts to take her over until in a skirmish, the bracelet is caught by Howard.  The doucheblade causes its holder to grow enormous [[breasts]] and armor in a parody of [[Witchblade]], and possessed by this, Howard kills the male lover of a businessman who works with Verde as he and Verde break into Suzy's house.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly encounter [[Cain and Abel]], the latter with a rock stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity.  There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard's return to his true form, and Beverly never being [[tight]] again, and meet parodies of [[John Constantine]], [[Wesley Dodds]], [[The Endless]], and Gerber's own [[Nevada (comics)|Nevada]] (called Utah), all characters from [[DC Comics]]' [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] [[imprint]].  The downside is that everyone staying in the place gets their every wish, so [[Che Guevara]] can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' vol. 2 #4</ref>  One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of [[Spider Jerusalem]]), takes Beverly and Howard to be on the [[Oprah Winfrey|Iprah]] Show with the topic "Why Women Give It to Men Who Don't Get It," guest starring [[Dr. Phil|Dr. Phlip]].  Upon leaving the house, Howard is once again transformed into a mouse.  Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the [[Angel Gabriel]] called Deuteronomy, intended to replace [[God]], because God has been spending all his time in a bar in [[Hell]] since 1938.  Deuteronomy is a creature half [[id]] and hald [[superego]], while Iprah is an all-[[ego]] promoter of self-indulgent [[pop psychology]].  Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends [[Cherub]] Thrasher to resurrect [[Sigmund Freud]], whose [[cigar]] blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk).  Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy.  Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' vol. 2 #5</ref>

Thrasher tells Howard that he is not dead, but in an Existential Suspension Loop or E.S.L., and takes him to the bar where God drinks.  [[Yahweh]], who prefers to be called "Yah," (saying being called "God" is like calling Howard "Duck" (a form to which Yah restores him for real)), leaves a resentful [[Jesus]] to take care of the [[Holy Ghost]]--Gabriel calls this "tripolar disorder"--in order to talk to Howard.  Yah says he prefers to talk to non-believers, since he did not create religion (other than [[Zoroastrianism]] as a [[practical joke]]), and says that ''[[Bonanza]]'' is more accurate as [[historical fiction]] than any religious text.  He created the [[multiverse]] as a work-for-hire, introducing sentient life in spite of his corporate employers' misgivings.  They were afraid of competition.  The only reason they don't "pull the plug" is because it's a popular [[tourist attraction]].  His employers insisted he create [[death]], so Yah sneaked [[evolution]] in, so that science would allow for the extension of life, as well as the [[afterlife]]--near earth asteroids are no accident and are sent by his colleagues.  In the end, Yah tells Howard, "you have to find your own little bit of grace," for he is still too busy trying to learn his project management software to have a master plan.  Howard asks if he can get out of the E.S.L., and Yah tells him he can go anywhere he chooses.  Yah shows Howard a possible existence on his homeworld, and he decides life with Beverly is preferable--so Yah uses a Trans-Planar Conduit to send him home.  Yah asks Howard to tell the people that he is really "a slob like one of them," but Howard says he doesn't want to say anything for fear of starting his own religion, declaring, "Let 'em believe what they want, 'til they're ready to use the brains you gave 'em."  Arriving in the empty Iprah studio, outside, he finds a bum who was paid $23 to give him a [[mezuzah]], a [[snow globe]] depicting one of the abstract, lifeless universes Yah showed Howard he created for hire.<ref>''Howard the Duck'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

In [[Adam Beechen]]'s ending of ''[[Doctor Fate]]: More Pain Comics'', which Gerber left unfinished when he died, Howard, who is heard but unseen, dispatched the [[Elf with a Gun]] to destroy [[Negal]] and [[Ymp]], then invited to Elf for one last drink with Yah, Bev, [[Thundarr the Barbarian|Thunny]], and Megs before Yah goes back "upstairs."<ref>''[[Countdown to Mystery]]'' #8</ref>

===[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]===
Sometime later, Howard attempts to register under the [[Superhero Registration Act]], but learns his socially disrupted life has created so many bureaucratic headaches that the government's policy is that Howard does not exist. This lack of government oversight delights him: "No more parking tickets, no taxes, no jury duty." In this story, as well, Howard says he was pressured to give up his cigars.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Choosing Sides]]'' #1 (Feb. 2006)</ref>

===Post-Civil War===
However, after he defeats the supervillain [[MODOK#Howard the Duck|M.O.D.O.T.]]'s scheme to control the public through mass media, his attorney, [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]], successfully restores his citizenship including all relevant responsibilities.<ref>''Howard The Duck'' #4 (Jan 2008)</ref>

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
Howard the Duck is briefly seen as part of the super-powered army gathered to battle invading Skrull forces.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> He is seen armed with a pistol.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref> He is later seen kicking a Skrull during interrogation after the invasion.<ref>''Secret Invasion''#8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Howard has no superhuman powers, but he is moderately skilled in the martial art known as "Quack-Fu".

==Characters==
Howard the Duck, as his name suggests, is a three-foot-tall [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[duck]]. He generally wears a tie and shirt, and is almost always found smoking a [[cigar]]. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to [[Donald Duck]], and Marvel redesigned that aspect of character.

Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude to the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, "Trapped in a world he never made", played off the [[genre]] trappings of 1950s [[science fiction]]<!--the following is a presumption, and needs to be attributed to a critic, an editor, Gerber, etc.: , but also reflected the sense of alienation that Howard shared with the majority of his readers-->. A common reaction to meeting Howard the first time is a startled, "You...you're a DUCK!"

His near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and [[Cleveland]] native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though she is a beautiful and sexy woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a [[sleepwalking]] [[crime]]-fighter) and Winda Wester (a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]ing ingénue with [[psychic]] powers); he has also worked with [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Man-Thing]] and associates on various occasions.

Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in "the Cosmic Axis" from a world similar to Earth, but where there are "more ducks" and "apes don't talk." In the black-and-white ''Howard the Duck'' magazine series, writer [[Bill Mantlo]] theorized that Howard came from an [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|extra-dimensional]] planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it "very pedestrian" and 'comic-booky' — in the worst sense of the term." He believes Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of cartoon animals.<ref>[http://www.stevegerber.com/interviews/diamond.php3 "Mad Genius, Angry Fowl" Interview], Diamond Comic Distributors, 2001. Retrieved on 2007-04-06.</ref> A panel in ''Fear'' #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic rat and an anthropomorphic dog, in a hypothetical panel about other dimensions.  [[Destroyer Duck]] was depicted existing in such a world, and in ''Howard the Duck'' vol. #6, Howard mentions that [[Moses]] is believed to be a [[moose]] in his world and [[Jesus|Yeshua]] a [[flying squirrel]].

His antagonists, who usually appear in a single story each, are often parodies of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] characters, and sometimes political figures, but also include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, also known as [[Doctor Bong]] - modeled on [[Doctor Doom]] and writers [[Bob Greene]] and [[Lester Bangs]] - is a former [[tabloid]] reporter who has the power to "reorder reality" by smashing himself on his [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped helmet; his main goal is to marry Beverly. After several issues, she agrees to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, and remains married to him for some time. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of ''[[She-Hulk]]'' and ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady (S. Blotte) who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]] and the [[Unification Church]] "Moonies". Another important villain was the Sinister S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring from Indecency) organization, whose leader was implicitly [[Anita Bryant]], though she looked like an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]] with a [[smiley face]]/[[orange (fruit)|orange]] on her head.

Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared, including [[Spider-Man]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], and the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]. Also, [[Omega The Unknown]] appeared to him in a dream, as did Spider-Man, whom he had previously met for real, unlike Omega.

Seemingly an [[autodidact]], Howard at various times references [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Albert Camus]] (whose novel ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' Gerber considers the principal influence on the series<ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/99202219022753.htm Steve Gerber: An Absurd Journey Part I: Interviews & Features Archive - Comics Bulletin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>), the [[Brontë]] sisters, and other figures of philosophical and political significance. In a parody of the Marvel comic character [[Shang-Chi]], he was trained in the art of ''Quak-Fu''. In the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking gesture toward Disney's mascot [[Mickey Mouse]], he was turned into various animals, primarily a [[mouse]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

He is swiftly slain by the original [[Ash Williams]] of the [[Evil Dead series]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #2-3</ref>

===MC2===
* Howard is seen as a blindfold-wearing martial arts teacher.<ref>[[J2 (comics)|J2]] #11</ref>

==Other media==
===Television===
* Howard the Duck was seen on [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s shirt on the animated series ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' (''The Phoenix Saga Part 2''). Aside from this, Howard never appeared in animation, although there have been reports of a cameo role in an (October 2008) episode of ''[[South Park]]''.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===Film===
* In [[1986 in film|1986]], [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Universal Pictures]] produced the movie ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'', starring [[Lea Thompson]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], [[Tim Robbins]], and, as the voice of Howard, [[Chip Zien]]. Besides Howard (who was portrayed by an assortment of stunt actors in a duck suit) the only character borrowed from the Marvel Comics mythos was Beverly Switzler, though in this version she was a rock singer. In the film, Howard is brought to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] by a laser experiment gone awry, which also summoned an evil alien called the Dark Overlord of the Universe, who was intent on destroying the Earth. The film was widely panned and was a [[box office bomb]].

===Other comics===
* In ''Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck'' #1 (Nov. 1996), Gerber claims that Howard and Beverly Switzler changed their names to Leonard the Duck and Rhonda Martini, remained in the Image Universe and "were last sighted in Chicago boarding the Amtrak for Buffalo" while the duck who returned to Marvel is "only an empty trademark, a clone whose soul departed him at the corner of Floss and Regret".<ref>"Fowl Play: the Behind-the Scenes Story of Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck #1 by Steve Gerber 1996</ref> This was done because [[Tom Brevoort]] invited Gerber to write the comic, claiming he was the only one to write Howard, then Gerber noticed the Howard guest appearances in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' and ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' and felt as though he had been tricked.<ref>[http://www.stevegerber.com/sgblog/2007/01/17/and-it%e2%80%99s-not-like-you%e2%80%99re-going-to-read-about-it-on-the-steve-gerber-web-site/ Stevegerblog] (Steve Gerber blog)</ref>

* In the [[Kitchen Sink Press]] series ''[[Megaton Man]]'', a comedy relief character is '''Gower Goose''', who is an intended parody of Howard.{{issue}}

* In the Claypool Comics series "Elvira Mistress of the Dark", Gordon the Goose (clearly modelled on Howard) appears, together with Dorkheem the Sorceror and Heap-Thing. (issues #49, 58 & 59)

* In America's Best Comics "Top 10" #8 a duck appearing to be Howard (with his distinctive blue hat & jacket) can be seen at the Transworld Transport Terminus.

===Newspaper comic strip===
Between June 1977 and October 1978 Howard the Duck appeared in a daily comic strip which featured in a number of papers including "The Toronto Star" and "Spokane Daily Chronicle". A total of eleven stories were printed as well as a number of single joke strips.<ref>as detailed on http://www.nemsworld.com/howard/</ref>

These began with original stories written by Steve Gerber and illustrated by Gene Colan: "Pop Syke", "The Cult of the Entropy", "The Self Made Man", "The Sleigh Jacking" and "In Search of the Good Life".

These were followed by an adaptation of the "Sleep of the Just" story from issue 4 of the Marvel comic, illustrated by Gene Colan and Alan Kupperberg, before Steve Gerber left the series to be replaced by Marv Wolfman as writer. Illustrated by Alan Kupperberg, the remaining stories were: "Close Encounters of the Fowl Kind", "The Tuesday Ruby", "The Clone Ranger", "The Mystery of the Maltese Human" and "Howard Heads Home".

As the series drew to an end, it was printed in fewer and fewer papers, making copies of these last (post Gerber) stories particularly hard to find.

Collections of some of these strips have been gathered together and can be seen at www.nemsworld.com/howard/.

===Memorabilia===

*Howard appears on a mid-1970s painted [[drinking glass]] from [[7-11]] [[convenience stores]].

===Toys===
* A Howard the Duck action figure is sold together with [[Toy Biz]]'s Marvel Legends Series 5 [[Silver Surfer]] figure. The only such figure as of 2007, it uses the original, pant-less version of the character.

* The Summer 2008 booster expansion entitled "Secret Invasion" of Heroclix includes Howard the Duck. His 'powers' include Master of Quack Fu, Offical Non-person, and Trapped in a Game He Never Made.  His sculpt shows him wearing pants. A Heroclix figure of Howard the Duck is part of the Secret Invasion expansion for the WizKids superhero combat game.

==Popular culture==
* In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s book ''[[The Transmigration of Timothy Archer]]'', published in 1982, one of the characters (Angel Archer) reads a current issue of ''Howard the Duck''.
* In [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[The Stand]]'', a character reads a ''Howard the Duck'' comic and is bewildered by the concept. In the 1990 reissue of the book, the comic was changed to ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.
* On the rock band [[The Pretenders]]' first album, 1980s ''[[Pretenders (album)|Pretenders]]'', the song "Precious" contains a brief reference.  Songwriter [[Chrissie Hynde]], a native of Northeastern Ohio, uses Cleveland as the backdrop for the song, which includes the lines:
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Howard the Duck and Mr. Stress &nbsp;[''a long-time local bar band'' ]&nbsp; both stayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trapped in a world that they never made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not me, baby, I'm too precious.
</blockquote>
<!--This needs confirmation; it seems highly unlikely given character licensing rights that this was Howard the Duck in a DC cartoon. Also "toy variation" is vague -- what does that mean? *A toy variation of Howard the Duck appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Comfort and Joy".-->
* The 1977 album [[Oops! Wrong Planet]] by rock band [[Utopia (band)|Utopia]] features the song "Trapped". The chorus lyrics are: "Trapped! Trapped in a world that he never made".
* On Lil' Waynes ''Tha Carter 2'' album, the song "Weezy Baby" features the line "...and I am no coward/No Howard the Duck."
