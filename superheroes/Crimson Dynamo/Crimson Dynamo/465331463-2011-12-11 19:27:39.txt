The '''Crimson Dynamo''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Красное Динамо, ''{{lang|ru|Krasnoye Dinamo}}'') is the name of several [[fictional character]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]], most of whom have been [[supervillain]]s. The various Crimson Dynamos have been [[powered armor]]-wearing [[Russia]]n or [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents who have clashed with the superhero [[Iron Man]] over the course of his heroic career. The original Crimson Dynamo first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #46 (Oct. 1963).

==Incarnations==
===Anton Vanko===
The first Crimson Dynamo was also the creator of the armor: Professor '''Anton Vanko''' (Ванко Антон). A Soviet scientist of [[Armenia]]n birth with a [[Ph.D]] in Physics, Vanko was the world's foremost expert on electricity. At the behest of the Soviet government, he built a powered exoskeleton capable of performing incredible feats; the Crimson Dynamo armor allowed Vanko to generate and control electricity in all of its forms, allowing him to fire devastating bolts of lightning and fly using electromagnetic propulsion.

As the Crimson Dynamo, Vanko was tasked by the Russian government with defeating [[Iron Man]], his American counterpart, in battle.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #46</ref> After losing to Iron Man, Vanko defected to the United States out of fear that his superiors would kill him for failing. Vanko began to work for Tony Stark as one of his chief scientists. Eventually, the two became friends, and Vanko developed pride and admiration for his new home. Unfortunately, soon the Soviets came for Vanko, just as he predicted. The KGB sent their top agent, the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], as well as Boris Turgenev, the latter of whom stole the armor and became the second Crimson Dynamo. Vanko died saving Iron Man by firing an unstable, experimental laser pistol at Boris, killing himself in the process.<ref name="Tales of Suspense #52">''Tales of Suspense'' #52</ref>

===Boris Turgenov===
'''Boris Turgenov''', the second Crimson Dynamo, had a very short career as a supervillain. In his first and only appearance, ''Tales of Suspense'' #52 (April 1964), Turgenov came to the United States with the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] to kill Anton Vanko, Tony Stark, and Iron Man (who the public thought was one of Stark's bodyguards). Turgenov almost carried out his mission, virtually defeating Iron Man with the stolen Crimson Dynamo suit. He was killed by Vanko, who, sacrificing his own life for the cause of freedom, fired an experimental and unstable laser pistol at Boris.

Both Vanko's heroic sacrifice and Turgenov's death was revisited in the Iron Man miniseries ''Enter the Mandarin'', where it is revealed that [[Temugin]] (the son of Iron Man's archenemy, the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]) witnessed the event.

===Alex Nevsky===
[[Image:Crimson Dynamo 002.jpg|thumb|right|'''Alex Nevsky''' as the third Crimson Dynamo.]]
'''Alex Nevsky''', the third Crimson Dynamo, first appeared in ''Iron Man'' #15 (July 1969). Nevsky was Anton Vanko's up-and-coming protege; he greatly admired and respected Vanko's scientific genius. However, the Soviet government discredited Vanko after he fled to the West, ruining Nevsky's promising career. Sent into exile for his association with the turncoat, Nevsky grew to hate the Soviet Union, as well as Iron Man for besting Vanko. Nevsky also sought vengeance against Tony Stark, whom Nevsky felt exploited Vanko under the American capitalist system (not knowing that Stark and Iron Man are the same person). Disguised as '''Alex Niven''', the brilliant new scientist behind Cord Industries, Nevsky planned to help the struggling competitor beat out Stark Industries in the marketplace.<ref>''Iron Man'' volume 1 #15</ref> From there, Nevsky went after Iron Man, besting him with a new and improved Crimson Dynamo armor. Finally, he worked towards undermining Tony Stark by romancing Janice Cord, Stark's girlfriend at the time and the daughter of Cord Industries' [[CEO]].

After he donned the Crimson Dynamo armor in public,<ref>''Iron Man'' #21</ref> his old Soviet masters sent the [[Titanium Man]] to kill him. When the Titanium Man killed Janice, Nevsky blamed Iron Man for the tragedy and swore to avenge her.<ref>''Iron Man'' #22</ref> Although he held [[Titanium Man]] just as responsible for Janice's death, Nevsky was forced by circumstance to partner with him and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] in Vietnam, where all three Communist-aligned fugitives formed the [[Titanic Three]].<ref>''Avengers'' #130</ref> After defecting to Vietnam, Nevsky made one final attempt to kill Iron Man, and was once again unsuccessful.<ref>''Iron Man'' #73</ref> As a result, he was found and assassinated by the [[KGB]], who confiscated his armor for their own purposes.<ref>According to the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]''</ref>

===Yuri Petrovich===
'''Yuri Petrovich''', the fourth Crimson Dynamo, first appeared in ''Champions'' #7 (Aug. 1976) as the son of '''Ivan Petrovich''' - a friend of the now-reformed Black Widow. When Western agents (presumably Americans) failed to convince Ivan to defect to the West, they assassinated Yuri's mother; in the chaos that followed, Ivan and Yuri each believed the other dead. Yuri was brought to the West, where Soviet agents posing as Westerners indoctrinated him to hate the West. When the Black Widow and Ivan defected to the United States, Yuri was "rescued" by the Soviets, returned to Russia, and trained as a KGB assassin. He was given the Crimson Dynamo armor and sent to kill the Black Widow and Ivan. Yuri and his allies (his girlfriend [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]], the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], [[Rampage (comics)|Rampage]], and the original [[Titanium Man]]) fought the Black Widow and her teammates, the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]]. When Yuri learned of the true nature of his "Western" captors, he went berserk. Darkstar teamed up with the Champions to subdue Yuri, and after he and his other allies were defeated, Yuri was returned to Russia, convicted by the Soviet government, and exiled to a [[Siberia]]n labor camp.<ref>''Champions'' #8-10</ref>

===Dmitri Bukharin===
{{Main|Dmitri Bukharin}}
[[Image:Yuricrimson.jpg|250px|thumb|left|'''[[Dmitri Bukharin]]''' as the fifth Crimson Dynamo, wearing Yuri Petrovich's armor.]]
'''[[Dmitri Bukharin]]''', the fifth Crimson Dynamo, was given Yuri's armor by his masters in the KGB. He joined the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]], but was expelled after his teammates decided to sever their connections to the Soviet government. Afterward, he received a new, redesigned suit of armor.<ref>Behind the scenes between ''Secret Wars II'' #7 and ''X-Factor'' Annual #1.</ref> He later joined the [[Supreme Soviets]], a group of superhumans who were loyal to the Soviet government; the group became the People's Protectorate after the USSR dissolved. When the new government confiscated his armor, he was given another suit and adopted the codename '''[[Dmitri Bukharin|Airstrike]]'''. By the events of ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'', however, he had returned to the identity and armor of the Crimson Dynamo, albeit as an ally of Iron Man instead of an enemy.

Bukharin's tenure as the Crimson Dynamo - from April 1978 (his debut in ''Iron Man'' #109) to April 1990 - is the longest of anyone in the Crimson Dynamo's publication history, and occurred during such seminal Iron Man storylines as "[[Demon in a Bottle]]", "[[Doomquest]]", and "[[Armor Wars]]". As a result, the Bukharin Dynamo is often considered to be the definitive version of the character.

===Valentin Shatalov===
[[Image:Crimson Dynamo Shatalov.jpg|thumb|'''Valentin Shatalov''' as the sixth Crimson Dynamo.]]
'''Valentin Shatalov''', a Colonel-General in the Soviet Army and a KGB agent, first appeared in ''Iron Man'' #255 (April 1990). He used his rank to obtain the Crimson Dynamo from Dmitri Bukharin for his own use. He was the founder of Remont-4, a group of Russian superhumans who sought to return the Soviet Union to [[Stalinism]]. Shatalov and his allies (the cyborg Firefox and the original [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], among others) recruited the original [[Titanium Man]] to their cause. The Remont-4 fought the Soviet Super Soldiers and a group of Russian mutant exiles in addition to plaguing Iron Man.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

In Shalatov's first appearance as the Dynamo, he was in a training session with [[Devastator (comics)|Devastator]] in Russia at the same time Iron Man had encountered an out-of-control mutant dubbing himself Freak Quincy in Los Angeles. Quincy's out-of-control powers tapped into Devastator's satellite uplink from the other side of the world, and he managed to switch the minds of Stark and Shalatov. His unfamiliarity with the Iron Man armor resulted in Shalatov firing pulse bolts that destroyed Quincy's arms, although the mutant survived. After Stark and Shalatov struggled to maintain each others' identities, Shalatov was able to get the hospitalized Quincy to recreate the transmission that switched their minds. Out of respect for Stark, Shalatov did not reveal Stark's identity.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

Some time after the fall of the Soviet Union, Shalatov received an upgraded Dynamo armor, less bulky than the Bukharin model, and with silver accents, this was the first Dynamo armor that was not completely crimson. Shalatov later met Tony Stark in person, when the latter traveled to Russia to oversee the opening of the first Stark Enterprises branch in the country, and revealed to Stark that he had kept his identity as Iron Man a secret. Stark's trip to Russia was interrupted by the rampage of the Titanium Man, Boris Bullski, who still could not accept the new Russia, and saw Stark's presence in his homeland as an affront to everything he believed the U.S.S.R. stood for. As the Titanium Man fought Iron Man, the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the Dynamo, Shalatov's leg was broken. He begged Iron Man not to finish the fight with Bullski, as he felt having the American Avenger take down a former Soviet hero would be too damaging to his country's morale. Stark volunteered to wear the Dynamo armor in Shalatov's place, and with radio assistance from Shalatov and the Widow, fought Bullski. When Bullski refused to surrender, Shalatov overrode Stark's control of the Dynamo armor, firing a blast that killed Bullski. Shalatov took the fall with his superiors, who had wanted to recover Bullski alive, and he was relieved of his duties as Crimson Dynamo.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

===Crimson Dynamo after the Cold War===
Like many of Iron Man's Cold War-era villains, the Crimson Dynamo fell into a degree of obscurity after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since Shatalov, there have been seven people to bear the Crimson Dynamo mantle, almost all of them anonymous, short-lived or otherwise unremarkable foes.

The seventh Crimson Dynamo was an unknown man wearing Dmitri Bukharin's former armor. His skill with the armor was minimal, and he was deftly handled by both [[Nick Fury]] (whom his employer had earlier brainwashed) and [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

[[Image:Crimsondynamogennady1.jpg|250px|left|thumb|'''Gennady Gavrilov''' as the eighth Crimson Dynamo.]]
In Marvel Epic's six issue 2003 series "Crimson Dynamo", '''Gennady Gavrilov''', a Russian collegiate, became the eighth Crimson Dynamo after he found the helmet of a suit designed by Anton Vanko - a "Beta unit", based on but improved over the original, with its very own recharging satellite in orbit. Believing the helmet to be a sophisticated gaming system, Gavrilov caused the dormant armor to awaken and make its way towards the helmet, inadvertently leaving a trail of destruction. He would eventually, if briefly, wear the entire armor in a standoff with the Russian military. He kept the armor afterward, but it is unknown if he ever wore it again.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

The ninth Crimson Dynamo appeared in the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' miniseries as a member of [[Lucia von Bardas]]'s army of villains, which she gathered to defeat the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. This Dynamo's armor was created by the [[Tinkerer]].{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

The tenth Crimson Dynamo is introduced in ''Iron Man'' vol. 4 #7 (June 2006), where he is apprehended by Iron Man after attempting to rob a bank. It was later revealed that this armor had been bought on the black market, and that the designs for Crimson Dynamo-based technology have been for sale for a while.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

The eleventh Crimson Dynamo was a member of the "Alpha Gen Soviet Super-Soldiers", a group of Russian superhumans put into cryogenic stasis after the Cold War ended. During a fight between [[The Order (comics)|the Order]] and the Infernal Man, Order member Corona set off an enormous explosion which awakened the Super-Soldiers. This Crimson Dynamo was apparently destroyed by Order members Supernaut and Aralune.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}

'''Boris Vadim''', the twelfth Crimson Dynamo, first appears in the premiere issue of ''Hulk'' vol. 2 (March 2008). A [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-sanctioned team consisting of Iron Man, [[Doc Samson]] and [[She-Hulk]] encounters the [[Winter Guard]], a Russian superhero team of which Vadim is a member, while investigating the apparent murder of the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] in Russia.<ref>''Hulk'' #1</ref>
In ''War Machine: Weapon of SHIELD'', Vadim was seen ignoring orders from his superiors and helping [[War Machine]] defeat invading [[Skrull]]s.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #35</ref> He later flees to the United States seeking political asylum, joining the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]]'s mercenary group.<ref>''Hulk'' #14''</ref> Some time later, while battling the mutated Igor Drenkov, Vadim was devoured.<ref>''Hulk: Winter Guard'' #0</ref>

'''Galina Nemirovsky''', a young woman, replaced Boris Vadim to become the thirteenth Crimson Dynamo.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = [[Hulk: Winter Guard]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = December 2009|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> She is considered by her Russian masters to be one of the best Crimson Dynamo pilots ever, and was a graduate of their "Federal Dynamo" program.<ref>''Darkstar & The Winter Guard'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Crimson Dynamo wears an armored battle-suit that serves as an exoskeleton, providing the wearer with superhuman strength and durability. The suit's outer layer was composed of a carborundum matrix alloy, and is equipped with hand-blasters that can fire high-frequency electrical bolts, small missiles contained in the back shoulder area of the battle-suit, computers and radio transmitter and receiver, boot jets that allow flight. Subsequent versions of the battle-suit have featured upgrades of various kinds, by the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]] and other Russian scientists. As Crimson Dynamo, Valentin Shatalov's version of the armor was equipped with a powerful chest-mounted fusion-caster weapon.

==Other versions==
===Civil War: House of M===
In the [[House of M]], Crimson Dynamo was a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #2</ref>

===Ultimate Crimson Dynamo===
[[The Ultimates]] featured '''Alex Su''' (a '''[[China|Chinese]] Dynamo''') as a member of [[Liberators (comics)|The Liberators]]. Based on similar technology to Tony Stark's [[Iron Man|Iron-Tech]] he is unable to exit his armor, having been fused inside, but can supposedly use it to control up to 50 giant-sized drone versions (which are revealed to be piloted independently). He is apparently killed when [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Tony Stark]] vaporizes him while piloting the Iron Man Six aircraft.

Major '''Valentin Shatalov''' appears in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #47. He is based in a shack in [[Siberia]], and has apparently been out of contact with his superiors for a long time, becoming entirely self-sufficient. When he is given the order to activate his armor he has forgotten correct procedure, and his contact was not even sure he was still alive. Reed Richards reports that this Crimson Dynamo is an "Eastern Bloc version of Iron Man", making the latest Ultimate version extremely similar to the original character. He has joined forces with the Fantastic Four to defeat the [[Red Ghost]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* Crimson Dynamo appeared in the Iron Man portion of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''. The episode he appeared in was based on his first comic book appearance. In fact some of the stills are actual comic book panels.
* Crimson Dynamo appeared in two episodes of the [[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]] animated series voiced by [[William Hootkins]] and later by [[Stuart M. Rosen|Stu Rosen]]. In "Not Far From the Tree", he worked with an A.I.M.-made clone of [[Howard Stark]]. In "The Armor Wars (Part 1)", Tony Stark's discovery about Dynamo using Stark technology as part of his armor ignites the animated version of the [[Armor Wars]]. He wore the Crimson Dynamo armor associated with Valentin Shatalov; however, Stark referred him as "Yuri" in the episode.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Two versions of the Crimson Dynamo have appeared in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', voiced by [[Mark Oliver]] and [[Brian Drummond]]. In this version, the Crimson Dynamo armor was initially a [[monochromic]] white and red armor/robot designed for space travel by [[Project Pegasus]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm Comics Continuum]</ref> and could literally withstand anything.
** The first Crimson Dynamo appears in the episode "Iron Man vs. the Crimson Dynamo" and was piloted by '''Ivan Vanko''', a cosmonaut stranded in space in very close orbit to the [[Sun]] for two years. He crash-landed on an under construction highway and took a beeline for the Project Pegasus headquarters. After several failed attempts to stop him, Iron Man visits to Project Pegasus to find out Vanko's reasons for targeting the building. A scientist, Anton Harkov told Tony the story of leaving him in space, and that Vanko was out for revenge. While breaking through the building Vanko reveals one of his causes of his anger is that Harkov "took my family from me". Pepper then does a search for Vanko's family. One last attempt by Iron Man to save Harkov allows Pepper enough time to bring in Vanko's family. After seeing his family he abandons his attempts of revenge. This version had no weapons except for a flamethrower beneath the wrist (which could have been intended as a tool for repairs) and a jet pack (which could have been used for maneuvering in space) and relied on his tremendous strength in battle.
** The second appearance of the Crimson Dynamo was when it was piloted by '''O'Brian''' (one of Stane's bodyguards) in the episode "Seeing Red". Stane acquired the suit from Harkov in order to capture Iron Man, and analyze his suit. This version kept the jet pack, but Stane replaced the flamethrower with a powerful laser, redesigned it for pure ground use, and gave it two other lasers, missiles, and a powerful Gatling laser. (Stane later said Stark International would mass produce Crimson Dynamo armor, possibly to sell them as weapons to the military). After learning of Harkov's betrayal, Tony becomes enraged, after managing to escape he threatens to "burn Project Pegasus to the ground". The armor is defeated when Tony fights it in his new "Dynamo-Buster" armor, and he infects Project Pegasus' computers with the Technovore virus. Tony in turn regards this as one of his first "true" enemy defeats.
** The third appearance of the Crimson Dynamo was in the episode "Enter: Iron Monger". It was stated to be "Crimson Dynamo 3.0". After destroying a few Iron Man copies during a test, it was easily destroyed in turn by the Iron Monger mecha.
* Crimson Dynamo appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]. This version is based on the Valentin Shatalov version of the character. He teams with [[Melter]] in Doctor Doom's plot to frame and destroy Iron Man. This Dynamo speaks in severely broken English ("I am break you!"), referring to himself in the third person, and often calling random things weak (for example, he quoted "Interpersonal relationships are for the weak! Crimson Dynamo am strong!").{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
* Crimson Dynamo/Ivan Vanko<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/avengersemh/comics/aemh02prev01.jpg</ref> appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]]. In the episode "Iron Man is Born", Crimson Dynamo is shown as an inmate at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. In the episode "The Breakout" Pt. 1, he is freed alongside other villains and nearly killed Iron Man alongside Living Laser, Blizzard and Whiplash until he escaped and detonated the Vault. In the episode "Gamma World" Pt. 2, Crimson Dynamo was with [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]], and [[Wonder Man]] when they find Abomination in the desert. In the episode "Masters of Evil", Crimson Dynamo aided the supervillains in capturing the Avengers in exchange for destroying Iron Man. He along with the rest of them were defeated by the Avengers, but escaped thanks to Enchantress' magic. He later reappears in the episode "This Hostage Earth" alongside the rest of his team and the new members before fighting Captain America when the teams are split. He is later attacked by several spirits, to which he responds by screaming in terror. His fate is not presently known.

===Film===

* [[Mickey Rourke]] plays '''Ivan Antonovich Vanko''' — an amalgamation of the Crimson Dynamo and [[Whiplash (comics)#Anton Vanko|Whiplash]] — in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Michael Fleming, Marc Graser|title=Mickey Rourke set for 'Iron Man 2'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2009-03-11|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001114.html|accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> A disgruntled physicist and [[Bratva]] member, Vanko serves as the main antagonist of the film, forging a suit (a harness containing his own arc reactor, which powers two electrified whips) to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family. He is the son of Anton Vanko (portrayed by [[Yevgeni Nikolayevich Lazarev|Yevgeni Lazarev]]), who in the film collaborated with [[Howard Stark]] on the original arc reactor technology years ago. Howard Stark, however, took sole credit for inventing the arc reactor — which powers Tony Stark's factory, the Iron Man suit, and chest-mounted electromagnet — and had Anton discredited and deported back to the Soviet Union to live in squalor because the two disagreed on how to apply the new technology: Anton sought to use the reactor for military-industrial purposes to make money while Howard envisioned it primarily as a humanitarian invention. Disguising himself as [[motorsport marshal|fire marshal]] B. Turgenev (a reference to the second Crimson Dynamo), Ivan attacks Tony Stark with his "Whiplash" suit during the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco]]. At the film's climax, Vanko dons a suit of gray armor with features highly reminiscent of the various "Crimson Dynamo" suits, as well as upgraded whips from the Whiplash suit.

===Video games===
* Crimson Dynamo is the main villain in ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (video game)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]].
* Crimson Dynamo is a member of the [[Masters of Evil]] in the videogame ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. The Crimson Dynamo in-game is Valentin Shatalov, the sixth Crimson Dynamo yet the armor is not any existing one, but resembles a smoothed-out version of the eighth Crimson Dynamo (though he mentions he has had upgrades). He is a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] and assists [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]] and [[Mysterio]] in the attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Omega Base. Crimson Dynamo has special dialogue with Iron Man (who mentions to Iron Man that his new armor can defeat him). A VS simulation disk involves fighting Crimson Dynamo in Asgard.
* Crimson Dynamo appears in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' voiced by [[Jess Harnell]].
* The Valentin Shatalov version of Crimson Dynamo appears as a villain in [[Iron Man 2 (video game)|the video game adaption]] to ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' voiced by [[Dimitri Diatchenko]]. He is allied with both [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]], and is the pilot of the 20-foot Crimson Dynamo armor. He was allies with [[Kearson DeWitt]], but was soon stopped when DeWitt discovered [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|a spy]] inside of Shatalov's operation. Shatalov decided that it was time to utilize the Dynamo armor, and used it with great efficiency against Iron Man. After Iron Man pummeled Shatalov for a short time, the general fired an electric beam at him, and War Machine came in to distract Shatalov. Iron Man then defeated Shatalov and destroyed most of the Dynamo armor. Shatalov died after interrogation from the armored duo.
