Jeb's powers manifested while he deliberately taunted a boy from a rival family (Abe Cabot; the whole story arc ("She Lies With Angels") was a parody of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').<ref name=shelies>''Uncanny X-Men'' #437-441</ref> Jeb's father Thomas died when Jeb was very young. He develops what is commonly called '[[black lung]]' due to working in the local coal mines. Jeb has not joined any of the X-teams but has already had to deal with fallout from their problems. His house has been severely damaged by an attack from the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] when they came to take his sister Paige. She survives this attack. Jay, not in his right mind, is killed by the anti-mutant forces of the insane [[William Stryker]]. The Guthries have to deal with anti-mutant prejudice in their hometown, because of the large amount of mutants in their family.<ref name=shelies/> 

After the events of [[M-Day]], Jeb has lost his powers. In the wake of M-day [[Hank McCoy]] and [[Dark Beast]] visited the Guthrie's mother in hopes of getting a genetic sample because of the amount of mutants she produced. While Hank tried to convince Lucinda for her cooperation, [[Dark Beast]] persuaded Jeb's brother Lewis into trying a vial of an untested formula that could have returned him his powers. Instead the shot renders him sick. Hank McCoy is able to save Lewis's life.<ref>''New X-Men'' #42</ref>
