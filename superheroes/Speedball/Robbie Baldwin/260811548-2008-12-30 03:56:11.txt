'''Robert "Robbie" Baldwin''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] [[Character (arts)|character]], owned by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

Originally known as '''Speedball''', the character was created by artist [[Steve Ditko]] and writer [[Tom DeFalco]], initially as a candidate for Marvel's separate [[New Universe]] imprint.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/11/03/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-23/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed], [[Comic Book Resources]], November 3, 2005</ref>

Baldwin [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #22 (1988). The character's origin and early exploits as Speedball were depicted soon after in a solo series. Baldwin has spent most of his time as a member of the superhero team the [[New Warriors]].

In the Marvel Comics [[fictional crossover#comics|crossover]] "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Baldwin's powers change, and he changes his name and appearance to '''Penance'''.  Following this change, Baldwin becomes a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

==Publication history==
Marvel Comics published ten issues of the monthly comic book series ''Speedball'' from 1988 to 1989.  The series was primarily plotted and penciled by [[Steve Ditko]], who also supplied the covers.  It was co-written by [[Tom DeFalco]] and inked by several different artists. 

After the series' cancellation, the Speedball character primarily appeared in ''New Warriors'' and its related comics, written primarily by [[Fabian Nicieza]].  Speedball continued to be the most consistent character through the second and third volumes of the ''New Warriors''.  

Baldwin became a featured character in [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]]' ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'', after it was revealed that he was the only New Warrior to survive the Stamford disaster.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=98158 Paul Jenkins on Penance], [[Newsarama]], January 19, 2007</ref>  Baldwin's character underwent a drastic change in this series, in which his powers alter and he takes the name Penance, joining the Thunderbolts.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=96554 Better Know a Thunderbolt: Penance], [[Newsarama]], January 6, 2007</ref> He would also feature in his own [[limited series]], ''Penance: Relentless'', also written by Jenkins, which examines the background to these changes.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=11376 REFLECTIONS #221: Paul Jenkins, Part 2], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 9, 2007</ref> In the Thunderbolts comics series, [[Mike Deodato]] based Baldwin's appearance on actor [[Edward Norton]]{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

==Fictional character biography==
Robbie Baldwin is a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]<ref>[http://adherents.com/lit/comics/Penance.html The Religion of Speedball/Penance]</ref> born to a mother who co-starred in a [[soap opera]] with [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>''New Warriors'', vol. 1 #32</ref> As a high school student, he becomes a costumed crimefighter after an accident at the Hammond Research Laboratory where he works part-time. When Hammond scientists try to tap into a mysterious other-dimensional energy source, the energy bombards Baldwin. Baldwin survives the experience but finds himself surrounded by energy bubbles and clad in an odd costume.

During a battle with some thieves minutes later, Baldwin discovers that his body now generates a kinetic energy field that protects him from impact and makes him a bouncing dynamo of [[kinetic energy]]. Calling himself Speedball, Baldwin becomes a crimefighter in his hometown of [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]],  [[Connecticut]].<ref>''Speedball #1''</ref>  Baldwin's father, a successful [[district attorney]], and his mother, a former soap opera star-turned teacher, have marital problems while Baldwin secretly leads his double life.  This situation leads to domestic stress that escalates over time, driven partly by the conflict between Robbie and his father, who as district attorney is expected to uphold Springdale's ordinance against costumed superheroes and has an extreme prejudice against these "[[vigilante]]s". 

The energy source also affect Niels, a cat belonging to one of the scientists, giving him the same powers. Speedball makes a number of attempts to catch the cat, hoping that study of Niels would give him better control of his powers. He would later learn that a villainous scientist, Clyde, was also after the cat, hoping to gain Speedball-like powers, and had allegedly created most of the supervillains in Springdale to this end. Speedball would later adopt the cat.

===The New Warriors===
When Baldwin is shopping in [[New York City]] with his mother, he joins a battle between [[Terrax]] and a number of superheroes. The heroes become the founding members of the [[New Warriors]], and Baldwin agrees to join the team. The commute from Connecticut to New York City is difficult — he is depicted jumping in front of a speeding train to get enough of a kinetic charge to bounce into the city — and Baldwin is frequently late for [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]]'s formal meetings. After Baldwin's mother discovers his secret identity, his parents' marriage ends and Baldwin moves permanently to New York City. Baldwin finds friendship with all of his fellow New Warriors, but his closest friendships were with [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and [[Rage (comics)|Rage]]. After Baldwin is transported to the dimension his powers derive from,<ref>''New Warriors'', vol. 1 #50</ref> Darrion Grobe joins the New Warriors as Speedball, although the other members think he is Baldwin. Baldwin returns from the kinetic dimension and begins a brief relationship with [[Timeslip (comics)|Timeslip]].

===Civil War===
{{seealso|Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Front Line}}
[[Image:Cwfrontline10.PNG|225px|left|The birth of Penance. Art by [[Steve Lieber]].|thumb]]
During the "Civil War", the New Warriors attempt to apprehend a group of supervillains in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] for their [[television]] [[reality television|reality show]]. [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], one of the criminals, creates an explosive blast that kills 612 civilians, including 60 children, as well as the New Warriors with the exception of Baldwin. This event triggers the push for superhero registration at the heart of "Civil War".<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref> Baldwin is presumed dead after the incident, but he is found alive after the blast launches him over 500 miles.<ref>''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #1 (Aug. 2006)</ref> Baldwin's kinetic field keeps him alive, but it "burns out" as a result. 

After awakening from a coma, Baldwin is arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed in federal prison. After he discovers his powers are still functional, Baldwin is taken to the new penitentiary called [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Negative Zone Prison Alpha|Negative Zone Prison Alpha]]. [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], the facility's creator, offers Baldwin the chance to testify before [[United States Congress|Congress]]. On the Capitol steps, Baldwin is shot by an assailant and taken away in an ambulance. The panel in which Speedball is shot bears a striking resemblance of the iconic photo in which [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was assassinated.<ref>http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/rubyshot.jpg</ref> Baldwin recovers from the wound (yet bullet fragments remain inoperably lodged near his spine), and Richards determines that Baldwin's powers are evolving. Baldwin thwarts an escape from the prison and says that he will comply with the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. 

Baldwin orders a new suit of armor that features 612 internal spikes (the number of Nitro's victims from Stamford) to trigger his powers. Baldwin then rechristianing himself "Penance" and was assigned to the Thunderbolts. 

The transition of Baldwin from "Speedball" to Penance was widely panned by fans of the character and by other writers at Marvel. This was reflected in other stories published shortly after the end of Civil War. In the ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI]] Summer Fun Spectacular''</ref>, [[Squirrel Girl]] (who has an unrequited crush on Speedball) confronts Robbie after learning of his transformation into Penance. Writer Dan Slott spoofs his transformation through forth-wall breaking satire, by having Robbie scream that he became Penance not out of guilt, but to become "deep" and to escape his comedy-character background. Furthermore, he reveals that he has created a similar "costume" for his pet cat Niels (who he has renamed "P-Cat, the Penitent Puss") while banging his head against the wall in a parody of the self-injury aspects of the emo-subculture. Writer Paul Jenkins, who wrote Civil War Frontline, later reversed his portrayal of Baldwin in Thunderbolts "Desperate Measures", portraying the character with his pre-Civil War personality and later, in the "Penance" mini-series retconning the purpose of the Penance costume: revealing that Baldwin designed it as an instrument of torture to be used on Nitro, who he utlimately hunted down and forced into the suit. Furthermore, the Penance mini-series also featured Wolverine (who teamed up to help Baldwin capture Nitro) jokingly ask Baldwin, after Robbie confided that he was going to have a new costume commissioned without the same number of spikes that the previous Penance suit contained, to get a brand new costume, citing that the old Penance costume made him look like a super-villain.

===Thunderbolts===
{{see also|Thunderbolts (comics)}}
After the events of Civil War, Baldwin joined [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s new government sponsored [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team. This team mostly comprises [[supervillain]]s who are being forced to reform, or at least give the appearance that they have in public. [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] has expressed concern about Penance's sanity, albeit for selfish reasons after Moonstone (who finds Baldwin and his survivor's guilt mental problems to be an annoyance) convinces him that Baldwin could be manipulated and exploited as a Hulk-level enforcer for Osborn's sinister schemes.

When Norman Osborn sends [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and Penance to deal with a vigilante named [[Americop]]<ref>''Thunderbolts: Desperate Measures''</ref>, Bullseye turns against Baldwin in order to force him to use his powers to cripple the vigilante. After finding out that Norman gave the order to Bullseye to do this, Baldwin destroys an expensive, one-of-a-kind eavesdropping device of Osborn's with his powers, while reminding him that unlike many of the Thunderbolts under Norman's leadership, he has no fail safe nanities in him that force his compliance. 

This causes Norman to gain a newfound respect for Penance. He arranges for [[Doc Samson]] to be assigned to give Robbie additional psychiatric assistance, much to Moonstone's professional jealousy, as Moonstone wanted to be named Baldwin's therapist instead so that she could exploit Penance's fragile mental state to her own ends. 

During this time, it is discovered that Robbie still has access to his original forcefield powers, using them to beat back a mind-controlled [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]]. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>. During this time, Samson is able to help Speedball focus his powers back to their original state, which he uses to defeat Moonstone in combat when (under the influence of a group of renegade telepaths) tries to kill Samson. 

Ultimately, in the five issue Penance mini-series, Baldwin goes [[desertion|AWOL]] from the Thunderbolts and leads them on a complicated series of wild goose chases as Baldwin, with Wolverine's help, makes his way to [[Latveria]] to bring back Nitro and make him stand trial for his act of mass murder. During this adventure, Baldwin steals the ill-gotten fortune of Norman Osborn's former employee and rival, Mendall Stromm after stealing information Norman obtained on Stromm illegally via his position with the Thunderbolts. He also defeats Doctor Doom (who was holding Nitro prisoner, for Namor the Sub-Mariner) and held his own against Wolverine in combat, before convincing the X-Man to aid him in his quest. After secretly donating Stromm's fortune to charity, for the rebuilding of Stamford, Baldwin arranges for a new Penance suit (with less spikes than the previous one) built after locking Nitro in the previous one.    

Unfortunately, shortly after the events of Secret Invasion, Moonstone would get her revenge against Speedball for defeating her in combat. After mocking his costume and survivor's guilt, Moonstone drugged Speedball and proclaimed that, in her capacity as a psychiatrist, she was going to have Speedball permenantly committed to a corrupt maximum security hospital she could find.

==Powers and abilities==
===As Speedball===
Baldwin's body became surrounded by a repulsive force field after coming into contact with kinetic energy. Early in his career, the slightest touch, such as snapping his fingers, would turn on this field, but he eventually gained conscious control over it. The field repelled all energy that struck it, especially kinetic energy. As such, bullets, punches, and all other physical attacks bounced off him. A side effect of this, though, was that he, too, would bounce in the opposite direction. Baldwin often used this to his advantage, such as purposely running into a wall in order to gain momentum and thus hit an opponent with twice the force.

While with the Warriors, Baldwin gained far greater control over his powers via a combination of experience in battle and Night Thrasher's mentorship off the battlefield. Whereas previously Baldwin could barely bounce in the direction he wanted, he eventually became more proficient at controlling his leaps and using his powers in various ways, such as to deliver impressive blows, and even to project a stream of [[kinetic energy]] from his bubble field at a distance.  He eventually learned to mentally "throw" the bubbles that surrounded his field to use as concussive force attacks.  He was able to somewhat deflect [[Siena Blaze|Siena Blaze's]] electromagnetic attack that "no one short of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] could have withstood", as well as resist the omnipath [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster's]] telepathy, one of the few people in the world to do so<ref> New Warriors #46</ref>.

===As Penance===
After the events of Stamford, Baldwin believed his powers to be burned out. However, they still exist, but now only manifest when he feels pain.  While his powers are still kinetically based, they no longer appear to manifest as a "bubble field." Rather, his powers seem far more explosive in nature.  In order to stimulate his powers, his Penance suit constantly rakes his flesh. Baldwin tolerates this to an almost masochistic degree, once stating that he would 'Wear [the suit] all the time if I could'. It's surmised{{Fact|date=November 2007}} that his new powers are actually stimulating his masochistic impulses, or that the contrary is possible: Baldwin's [[survivor guilt]] led him into a combination of his kinetic energies and the [[self-injury|cutting]] practice.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
In a reality where the Hulk, after being sent into space, kills [[Annihilus]] and leads the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] to Earth; Robbie (as Speedball) is one of the remaining superpowers, alongside [[Quentin Quire]] and his [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].<ref>''Exiles: Days of Then and Now'' #1</ref>

===[[House of M]]===
Robbie appears as a member of the [[House of M (characters)#Wolfpack|Wolfpack]].  He appears in his Speedball costume.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref>

===''Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers''===
Speedball features in an arc of [[Robert Kirkman]]'s ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 3), featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed "The League of Losers". A group of heroes including [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], [[Darkhawk]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], [[Araña]], [[X-23]], [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], and [[Terror Inc.|Terror]] (although Araña dies along the way) go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]' time machine, Chronok having come to the present and already having killed all of Marvel's major heroes.

It's revealed Chronok is from the same time period as Kirkman's [[Mutant 2099]]; the group stays with him and his mentor Reed Richards to wait for Chronok. The team defeats Chronok, but at the end of the story, Richards reveals they can't go back to their present, due to time-travel and alternate timelines. The group decides to stay in the future, satisfied with the impact they made, however unnoticed. Mutant 2099 suggests reforming the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] or the "Fantastic Nine".

Due to the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|method for resolving time travel paradoxes]], the League of Losers' actions created an alternate universe.  This is the alternate future visited by [[Squirrel Girl]], a superhero with a crush on him, in ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI]] Summer Fun'' (2007).  She tries to convince him to return, suggesting that no-one would mix him up with the Penance from her time, but before he can decide, the 2099 version of [[Craig Hollis|Mr Immortal]], Squirrel Girl's GLI leader, tells her she needs to return to the present.

===[[Marvel Zombies]]===
A zombified Speedball participates in a multi-zombie attack on the castle of [[Doctor Doom]]; where a few human survivors where hiding. Later, he is seen in the ruins of New York. He is one of the many casualties in the conflict waged against the [[Silver Surfer]], ending up torn apart by the [[Power Cosmic]].

===[[Marvel Apes]]===
In the Marvel Apes universe, a chimp version of Speedball appears alongside an ape-hero called Ape X. The two seem to act as partners and are both Avengers. He seems loyal to them, but at the end of the second issue he is seen with a group of what would usually be considered "his enemies". He asks Marty Gibbon about the human version of Speedball, but Marty doesnt have the heart to tell him about the Stanford incident. He's later revealed to be part of a group trying to reveal that the [[Alternate versions of Captain America#Marvel Apes|Captain America]] leading the Ape-vengers is [[Baron Blood (comics)|Baron Blood]] in disguise. After freeing the  [[Captain America|real Cap]] from the ice, the group goes out to fight Blood and in the battle, Speedball is gravely wounded and is taken through the portal to the 616 universe to be medically treated. After being healed, he says that he can't go back, as he'd be seen as a traitor for helping humans, and in the epilogue he tries applying for the Avengers.

===MC2===
An older version of Speedball exists in the [[MC2]] universe, and appears sporadically in the ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' series and related miniseries.  At some point he became a member of the Avengers, but has since left the team

===Ultimate Speedball===
An [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Speedball is mentioned in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #81. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man Annual'' #2 (2006), an overweight man in a Speedball costume is depicted in police custody.

==In other media==
===Video games===
*In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'' [[video game]] (which was only released in Japan), Speedball makes a brief appearance between levels to talk with Spider-Man.

*Speedball is mentioned in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game. While racing the [[Human Torch]], [[Spider-Man]] jibes: "Speedball is faster than you!" He is also mentioned in the game while Peter researches himself on a website on mutants; one article is noticed by Peter with Speedball claiming "He's the coolest guy since the '''[[Ultimates]]'''."
