'''Robert "Robbie" Baldwin''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] character that appears in [[Marvel Comics]]. Originally known as '''Speedball''' and later as '''Penance''', the character was created by artist [[Steve Ditko]] and writer [[Tom DeFalco]], initially as a candidate for Marvel's separate [[New Universe]] imprint.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/11/03/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-23/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed (column of Nov. 3, 2005]</ref>
Baldwin [[first appeared]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #22 (1988). Baldwin's origin and early exploits as Speedball were depicted soon after in a solo series. Baldwin has spent most of his time as a member of the superhero team the [[New Warriors]].  In the Marvel Comics [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Baldwin's powers change, and he changes his name and appearance to Penance.  Following this change Baldwin becomes a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

==Publication history==
Marvel Comics published ten issues of the monthly comic book series ''Speedball'' from 1988 to 1989.  The series was primarily plotted and penciled by [[Steve Ditko]], who also supplied the covers.  It was co-written by [[Tom DeFalco]] and inked by several different artists. 

After the series' cancellation, the Speedball character primarily appeared in ''New Warriors'' and its related comics, written primarily by [[Fabian Nicieza]].  Speedball continued to be the most consistent character through the second and third volumes of the ''New Warriors''.  

Baldwin became a featured character in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'', after it was revealed that he was the only New Warrior to survive the Stamford disaster.  Baldwin's character underwent a drastic change in this series, in which his powers alter and he takes the name Penance, joining the Thunderbolts.

==Fictional character biography==
Robbie Baldwin is a high school student who becomes a costumed crimefighter after an accident at the Hammond Research Laboratory where he works part-time. When Hammond scientists try to tap into a mysterious other-dimensional energy source, the energy bombards Baldwin. Baldwin survives the experience but finds himself surrounded by energy bubbles and clad in an odd costume.

During a battle with some thieves minutes later, Baldwin discovers that his body now generates a kinetic energy field that protects him from impact and makes him a bouncing dynamo of kinetic energy. Calling himself Speedball, Baldwin becomes a crimefighter in his hometown of [[Springdale, Connecticut]].<ref>''Speedball #1''</ref>  Baldwin's father, a successful [[District Attorney]], and his mother, a former soap opera star-turned teacher, have marital problems while Baldwin secretly leads his double life.  This situation leads to domestic stress that escalates over time, driven partly by the conflict between Robbie and his father, who as District Attorney is expected to uphold Springdale's ordinance against costumed superheroes and has an extreme prejudice against these "[[vigilantes]]". 

The energy source also affect Niels, a cat belonging to one of the scientists, giving him the same powers. Speedball makes a number of attempts to catch the cat, hoping that study of Niels would give him better control of his powers. He would later learn that a villainous scientist, Clyde, was also after the cat, hoping to gain Speedball-like powers, and had allegedly created most of the supervillains in Springdale to this end. Speedball would later adopt the cat.

===The New Warriors===
When Baldwin is shopping in [[New York City]] with his mother, he joins a battle between [[Terrax]] and a number of superheroes. The heroes become the founding members of the [[New Warriors]], and Baldwin agrees to join the team. The commute from Connecticut to New York City is difficult — he is depicted jumping in front of a speeding train to get enough of a kinetic charge to bounce into the city — and Baldwin is frequently late for [[Night Thrasher]]'s formal meetings. After Baldwin's mother discovers his secret identity, his parents' marriage ends and Baldwin moves permanently to New York City. Baldwin finds friendship with fellow New Warriors [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and [[Rage (comics)|Rage]]. After Baldwin is transported to the dimension his powers derive from,<ref>''New Warriors'', vol. 1 #50</ref> Darrion Grobe joins the New Warriors as Speedball, although the other members think he is Baldwin. Baldwin returns from the kinetic dimension and begins a brief relationship with [[Timeslip (comics)|Timeslip]].

===Civil War===

In the 2006 multi-title [[fictional crossover|crossover]] "Civil War", the New Warriors attempt to apprehend a group of supervillains in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] for their [[television]] [[reality show]]. [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]], one of the criminals, creates an explosive blast that kills about 600 civilians, including 60 children, as well as the New Warriors with the exception of Baldwin. This event triggers the push for superhero registration at the heart of "Civil War".<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #1</ref> Baldwin is presumed dead after the incident, but he is found alive after the blast launches him over 500 miles.<ref>''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #1 (Aug. 2006)</ref> Baldwin's kinetic field keeps him alive, but it "burns out" as a result. 

After awakening from a coma, Baldwin is arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed in federal prison. After he discovers his powers are still functional, Baldwin is taken to the new penitentiary called [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Negative Zone Prison Alpha|Negative Zone Prison Alpha]]. [[Reed Richards]], the facility's creator, offers Baldwin the chance to testify before the [[U.S. Congress]]. On the Capitol steps, Baldwin is shot by an assailant and taken away in an ambulance. The panel in which Speedball is shot bears a striking resemblance of the iconic photo in which Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated.<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/rubyshot.jpg]</ref> Baldwin recovers from the wound (under Baldwin's request, the bullet remains lodged in his spine), and Richards determines that Baldwin's powers are evolving. Baldwin thwarts an escape from the prison and says that he will comply with the Superhuman Registration Act. Baldwin orders a new suit of armor that features 612 internal spikes that cause him constant pain, symbolic of the 612 deaths he feels responsible for (60 of which are larger and cause more pain, reminiscent of the 60 children who lost their lives of the 612). In Nova #3, Baldwin removes his helmet to reveal himself to his old friend, and only has minor bleeding on his head.

===Thunderbolts===
{{see also|Thunderbolts (comics)}}
After his psychological and physical transformation into Penance, Baldwin joined [[Norman Osborn]]'s new government sponsored [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team. This team is comprised mostly of [[supervillain]]s who are being forced to reform, or at least give the appearance that they have in public. Penance believes he fits in with the rest of his new teammates as a reforming supervillain. Ironically, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] has expressed concern about Penance's sanity, albeit for selfish reasons. 

Recently, after Nova returned to Earth, he was attacked by the Thunderbolts, who wrongly attacked him for being an unregistered superhuman. Robbie, however, held back, unwilling to fight his best friend. But as the battle escalated, he used his powers against Nova, but only to stop the fighting, not to harm him. Nova easily withstood the attack and was about to retaliate when Iron Man arrived and took the Thunderbolts to task for starting the battle. Later that evening, Robbie arrived at the home of Nova's parents and revealed his identity to his former teammate, who was shocked by the revelation. He apologizes to Nova for attacking him and asks him to join the Initiative. But Nova, shaken by how much things have changed in his absence, decides to return to space. He says goodbye to Robbie and asks him not to let the Initiative turn him into something he isn't.

Outside of ''Thunderbolts'', Penance also appears in the ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI]] Summer Fun Spectacular'' one-shot comedy comic. [[Squirrel Girl]], who has romantic feelings for Robbie, is shocked at how much he has changed, and attempts to bring him back to his old self by explaining that none of this was his fault. He refuses to listen, however, insisting "You just don't ''get it'', do you? This self-punishment thing? It's too ''deep'' for you!"   while repeatedly banging his head on a wall. He also claims that his pet cat Niels is now "P-Cat, the Penitent Puss", who now wears a similar torture costume. The comic itself self-referentially maintains "it's canon, fanboys."

Recently, in the ''Desperate Measures'' one shot, Norman Osborn sends [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] and Penance to deal with a vigilante named [[Americop]], with Bullseye as team leader. Bullseye's mission is to cause Penance so much pain that his power would overload Americop, burning out most of Americop's nervous system. Penance is not happy about this and destroys an expensive device of Osborn's. Ironically, right after this, Osborn sends a memo stating that Penance is making progress.

==Powers and abilities==
===As Speedball===
Baldwin's body became surrounded by a repulsive force field after coming into contact with kinetic energy. Early in his career, the slightest touch, such as snapping his fingers, would turn on this field, but he eventually gained conscious control over it. The field repeled all energy that striked it, especially kinetic energy. As such, bullets, punches, and all other physical attacks bounced off of him. A side effect of this, though, was that he, too, will bounce in the opposite direction. Baldwin often used this to his advantage, such as purposely running into a wall in order to gain momentum and thus hit an opponent with twice the force.

While with the Warriors, Baldwin gained far greater control over his powers via a combination of experience in battle and Night Thrasher's mentorship off the battlefield. Whereas previously Baldwin could barely bounce in the direction he wanted, he eventually became more proficient at controlling his leaps and using his powers in various ways, such as to deliver impressive blows, and even to project a stream of [[kinetic energy]] from his bubble field at a distance.  He eventually learned to mentally "throw" the bubbles that surrounded his field to use as concussive force attacks.  He was able to somewhat deflect [[Siena Blaze|Siena Blaze's]] electromagnetic attack that "no one short of the Hulk could have withstood", as well as resist the omnipath [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster's]] telepathy, one of the few people in the world to do so<ref> New Warriors #46</ref>.

===As Penance===
After the events of Stamford, Baldwin believed his powers to be burned out. However, they still exist, but now only manifest when he feels pain.  While his powers are still kinetically based, they no longer appear to manifest as a "bubble field." Rather, his powers seem far more explosive in nature.  In order to stimulate his powers, his Penance suit constantly rakes his flesh; Baldwin tolerates this to an almost Masochistic degree, once stating that he would 'Wear [the suit] all the time if I could'. It's surmised{{Fact|date=November 2007}} that his new powers are actually stimulating his masochistical impulses, or that the contrary is possibile: Baldwin's [[survivor's guilt]] led him into a combination of his kinetic energies and the [[self-harm|cutting]] practice.

==Other versions==
===''Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers''===
Speedball features in an arc of [[Robert Kirkman]]'s ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 3), featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed "The League of Losers". A group of heroes including [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], [[Darkhawk]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], [[Araña]], [[X-23]], [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]] and [[Terror Inc.|Terror]] (although Araña dies along the way) go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing [[Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]]' time machine, [[Chronok]] having come to the present and already having killed all of Marvel's major heroes.

It's revealed Chronok is from the same time period as Kirkman's [[Mutant 2099]]; the group stays with him and his mentor Reed Richards to wait for Chronok. The team defeats Chronok, but at the end of the story, Richards reveals they can't go back to their present, due to time-travel and alternate timelines. The group decides to stay in the future, satisfied with the impact they made, however unnoticed. Mutant 2099 suggests reforming the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] or the "Fantastic Nine".

Due to the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|method for resolving time travel paradoxes]], the League of Losers' actions created an alternate universe.  This is the alternate future visited by [[Squirrel Girl]], a superhero with a crush on him, in ''[[Deadpool]]/[[Great Lakes Initiative|GLI]] Summer Fun'' (2007).  She tries to convince him to return, suggesting that no-one would mix him up with the Penance from her time, but before he can decide, the 2099 version of [[Craig Hollis|Mr Immortal]], Squirrel Girl's GLI leader, tells her she needs to return to the present.

===[[Marvel Zombies]]===
A zombified Speedball participates in a multi-zombie attack on the castle of [[Doctor Doom]].

===MC2===
An older version of Speedball exists in the [[MC2]] universe, and appears sporadically in the ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' series and related miniseries.  At some point he became a member of the Avengers, but has since left the team



===Ultimate Speedball===
An [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Speedball is mentioned in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #81. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man Annual'' #2 (2006), an overweight man in a Speedball costume is depicted in police custody.
