'''Speedball''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[Marvel Comics]].

'''Robert Baldwin''' was a young [[intern]] at a scientific research firm in [[Connecticut]] when he was exposed to the energy from another dimension, becoming '''Speedball'''. He gained the power to surround himself with a field of super bouncy material, which also made him invulnerable.
He soon joined the [[New Warriors]]. For a time, he was transported back to the dimension he gained his powers from. During this time, Darrion Grobe took up the mantle of Speedball.
