'''Willie Lumpkin''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], who is best known as the [[mailman]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] in their self-titled comic book.

==Newspaper comic strip==

The character was originally created for a [[print syndication|syndicated]], daily comic strip by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Dan DeCarlo]].  Lee had initially submitted samples of a strip about a [[New York City]] beat cop, but was told by his editor that it was too "big city-ish" and that he wanted a friendly mailman to better appeal to mainstream America.  ''Willie Lumpkin'', which was only published in 1960, drew humor from the people and situations Willie Lumpkin would encounter along his mail delivery route in the small town of "Glenville."

==In Marvel Comics==
Lee and artist [[Jack Kirby]] then introduced their comic book version of Willie Lumpkin in ''Fantastic Four'' #11 (February, 1963).  The comic book Lumpkin is depicted as significantly older than in the comic strip, though the character's good nature was retained, as were references to his past as a mailman in Glenville, which the comic book located in [[Nebraska]].

In his first comic book appearance, Lumpkin is represented as having befriended the Fantastic Four, to whom he makes regular fan mail deliveries at their [[Baxter Building]] headquarters in New York City.  He half-jokingly requests to join the team on the grounds that he has the "power" to wiggle his [[ear]]s.  He serves as their mailman for many years, and on occasion falls into the zone of danger that typically surrounds the adventuring heroes.  Examples include a story in which he is forced to spend Christmas Eve locked in a closet while the Fantastic Four fight the [[Super-Skrull]], or when he is mind-controlled into accessing [[Doctor Doom]]'s time machine by a minion of Immortus, the future identity of [[Kang the Conqueror]].  An alien [[Skrull]] also impersonates him in another story to infiltrate the Fantastic Four's headquarters.  Willie Lumpkin also crossed over into ''[[Spider-Man]]'' comics, where he briefly dates Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]].

Willie Lumpkin appeared in his own solo feature in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #18 (May, 1989).  The fan-favorite story was a parody of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' in which Lumpkin is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who had intended to haunt cantankerous Spider-Man nemesis [[J. Jonah Jameson]] but couldn't find his address.  The story concludes with the normally amiable postman deciding that he hates Christmas.

==Other versions and appearances in other media==

In the 2005 [[Fantastic Four (2005 movie)|''Fantastic Four'' film adaptation]], Willie Lumpkin was portrayed by his own creator, Stan Lee.

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, there is a government agent named Lumpkin, who works for the agency that runs the think-tank/school in the Baxter Building.  Although his first name is not mentioned, this is an obvious homage.

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, a character named Tino Lumpkin was a member of the [[Challengers of the Fantastic]], who worked as postman for that team. Though he had no on-panel appearances, Tino Lumpkin is the [[Amalgam Comics]] equivalent of Willie Lumpkin.
