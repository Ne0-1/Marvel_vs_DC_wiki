==Publication history==

===Newspaper comic strip===

The character was originally created for a [[print syndication|syndicated]] daily comic strip by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Dan DeCarlo]]. Lee recalled in a 1998 interview that,
{{quote|[[Mel Lazarus]] had done a strip called ''[[Miss Peach]]'', which used not panels but one long panel instead. I liked that idea very much, so when Harold Anderson, the head of Publishers Syndicate, asked me to do a strip, I came up with ''Barney's Beat'', which was about a New York City cop and all the characters on his patrol who he'd meet every day and there would be a gag. I did some samples with Dan DeCarlo, and I thought it was wonderful. Harold said it was too "big city-ish" and they're not going to care for it in the small towns because they don't have cops on a beat out there. He wanted something that would appeal to the hinterland, something bucolic. He said, "You know what I want, Stan? I want a mailman! A friendly little mailman in a small town." I don't remember if I came up with the name Lumpkin or he did, but I hated it. I think I came up with the name as a joke and he said, "Yeah, that's it! Good idea!"<ref name=comicbookartist>{{cite news |  title=Stan the Man & Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas | url = http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html | work = [[Comic Book Artist]] | issue = 2 | date = Summer 1998 |accessdate= 2013-12-30}}</ref>}}

''Willie Lumpkin'' drew humor from the people and situations Willie would encounter along his mail delivery route in the small town of Glenville. The daily strip ran from December 1959 to May 6, 1961. A Sunday strip ran through May 28.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ger |last=Apeldoorn | publisher = The Fabuleous Fifties|title=Late Mail|url=http://allthingsger.blogspot.nl/2013/11/late-mail.html | date= November 11, 2013}}</ref>

===Marvel Comics===
Lee and artist [[Jack Kirby]] then introduced their comic book version of Willie Lumpkin in ''Fantastic Four'' #11 (Feb. 1963).  The comic book Lumpkin is depicted as significantly older than in the comic strip, though the character's good nature was retained, as were references to his past as a mailman in Glenville, which the comic book placed in [[Nebraska]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In his first comic book appearance, Lumpkin is represented as having befriended the Fantastic Four, to whom he makes regular fan mail deliveries at their [[Baxter Building]] headquarters in New York City.  He half-jokingly requests to join the team on the grounds that he has the "power" to wiggle his [[ear]]s.

Lumpkin appeared in his own solo feature in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #18 (May 1989). In this parody of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', he is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who had intended to haunt cantankerous Spider-Man nemesis [[J. Jonah Jameson]] but couldn't find his address. The story concludes with the normally amiable postman deciding he hates Christmas.

==Fictional character biography==
In Marvel Comics, Willie Lumpkin serves as the postal worker mailman whose Manhattan route includes the joint home and office of the superhero group the [[Fantastic Four]]. On occasion he falls into the danger that typically surrounds the adventuring heroes. Examples include a story in which he is forced to spend Christmas Eve locked in a closet while the Fantastic Four fight the [[Super-Skrull]],{{issue|date=March 2013}} or when he helped to save the team from the [[Mad Thinker]]. This incident involved Reed's trust in Lumpkin; he had hired the mailman to manipulate the machinery as part of a safety routine.<ref>"Fantastic Four" Vol 1. #15 (June 1963)</ref> Later Lumpkin is mind-controlled into accessing [[Doctor Doom]]'s time machine by a minion of [[Immortus]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}  An alien [[Skrull]] also impersonates him in another story to infiltrate the Fantastic Four's headquarters.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

He also briefly dated [[Peter Parker]]'s [[Aunt May]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/49115/#263953 ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #343 (Jan. 1991)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> When May briefly appeared to have died, Lumpkin grieved and was seen to befriend a new companion named Doreen Greenwald.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/18329/ ''Spider-Man Holiday Special, 1995'' (1995)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref>

Lumpkin has since retired, and his niece Wilhemina "Billie" Lumpkin has taken his position as the Fantastic Four's mail carrier.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/61472/#307013 ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3, #2 (Feb. 1998)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

He was interviewed about the Fantastic Four on the news show ''Lateline'',<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/335453/ ''Fantastic Four'' #543 (April 2007)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> saying how  though the group took on cosmic menaces, they always found time to greet him. Sometime later, the super-team, miniaturized, entered his body to remove an otherwise inoperable brain tumor.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/946711/#1080226 ''Fantastic Four'' #606 (July 2012)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

''[[Marvels]]'' is a "history" of the world of Marvel super-heroes painted by [[Alex Ross]] and which spans from the late 1930s to the 1960s. In one scene, main character Phil Sheldon, a journalist who observes the Marvel characters from a distance (and sometimes close-up), meets his ex-girlfriend in a [[movie theatre]] where she introduces him to her date, Bill Lumpkin. With a smile, Lumpkin tells Sheldon that they have met though he states that Sheldon will not remember where, causing the reporter a little embarrassment.<ref>"Marvels" Vol. 1 #1 (Jan. 1994)</ref>
