'''Despero''' is the name of a fictional supervillain in the DC Comics universe. 

He is easily distinguished by his muscular body, pink skin, fin on his head, pointed ears, lavender eyes (and a third eye on his forehead), and sharp teeth. He stands at 6'5" and weighs in at 289 lbs.

Despero made his first appearance in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #1 from the [[1960s]]. He looked significantly different in that issue than he did in later appearances. His current bulked-up look comes from the fact he bathed in the Flame of Py'tar, a power-giving flame from his native planet Kalanor, a planet he enslaved and conquered.

He is most well-known for his classic battle with Justice League International. He is also known for brutally murdering the parents of the Justice League member called [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]]. His most classic look is just simply him wearing a [[United Nations]] flag like a cape.

His hatred of the Justice League burns like an inferno, and he hopes to one day adorn his mantelpiece with their skulls, in a metaphorical sense.

== Powers and Abilities ==

Despero is a villain who is not to be underestimated. The Flame of Py'tar made Despero into a superhuman wrecking machine with near Superman-level strength and toughness.

However, Despero is not a dumb hunk of muscle. He's very intelligent, and a master manipulator, often using psychology against the JLA. The third eye on his forehead is directly conneted to his brain, giving him telepathic powers that rival the [[Martian Manhunter]].

== Appearances in other media ==

Despero has appeared in the [[2000s]] ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' cartoon, voiced by [[Keith David]].
