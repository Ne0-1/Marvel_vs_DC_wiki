'''Despero''' is the name of a fictional supervillain in the DC Comics universe. 

He is easily distinguished by his muscular body, pink skin, fin on his head, pointed ears, lavender eyes (and a third eye on his forehead), and sharp teeth.

Despero made his first appearance in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #1 from the [[1960s]]. In these early appearances, he appeared of normal build. His current bulked-up look is a result of having bathed in the Flame of Py'tar, a power-giving flame from his native planet Kalanor, which he enslaved and conquered with his [[psychic]] abilities. In his first appearance the Justice League liberated the planet from his rule, and he has sworn vengeance ever since.

Making his debut with the release of Justice League of America #1 (1961), Despero has the distinction of being the Justice Leagueâ€™s first adversary, and has gone through virtually as many transformations as the League itself.  Initially conceived as a physically weak, mind-controlling tyrant with a penchant for playing chess for the fates of his enemies, he was later redesigned to be a physical powerhouse fueled by his burning, all-consuming hatred of the Justice League.  

He is most well-known for his classic battle with Justice League International. He is also known for brutally murdering the parents of Justice League member [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]].

During the "Breakdowns" story (which ran through Justice League America/Justice League Europe titles), Despero returned to Earth. Despero attacked the Justice League and Lobo at the [[United Nations]] building (New York) and even donned the [[United Nations]] flag as a cape. After being defeated  his mind was transferred with that of the Justice League robot [[L-Ron]]. Although he was seemingly killed when L-Ron's body was destroyed by a duck hunter, he was later shown to be battling for control of his original body. L-Ron succeeded in casting him out, at which point he existed as a "free floating evil essence", able to possess innocent people. 

During ''JLA/JSA: Virtue and Vice'' he had joined forces with [[Johnny Sorrow]] in a plan to destroy the League and the [[Justice Society]]. He possessed President [[Lex Luthor]], but was cast out of the President by Johnny Sorrow's own gaze and apparently returned to corporeal form.

Years later, in the wake of ''Identity Crisis'', the JLA was attacked by a reformed [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] that once again knew the heroes' alter-egos. The [[Martian Manhunter]] discovered Despero was responsible for the restoration of the Society's memory. After he was defeated, Despero was taken by [[Hal Jordan]] into [[Oa]]'s custody.

==Powers and abilities==
Despero is a powerful villain. The Flame of Py'tar gave Despero physical strength and durability that surpasses beings like Superman and Captain Marvel. Also very intelligent, he is skilled as both a warrior and [[tyrant]]. His hypnotic third eye is directly connected to his brain, giving him telepathic powers that surpass (as seen in ''JLA'' #119) those of the [[Martian Manhunter]]. It is also capable of projecting realistic illusions and entrancing virtually any sentient being. It can also project beams of telekinetic energy enabling the teleportation of matter anywhere in the universe.

In his "spirit" form, Despero can possess any living being, granting the victim the strength and telepathic abilities of his own body.

In his first appearance, Despero used a [[teleportation]] machine which resembled a chess set. It used pieces shaped like the Leaguers to move them to different locations. The machine was subsequently shown to be in the possession of the [[Weapon Master]].

Despero was defeated in the Justice League series when the Py'tar briefly took willing possession of the Martian Manhunter and appealed to the people of Kalanor to reject Despero's ways and accepted it as the living soul of the planet, which they did. The Py'tar then spread its power across Kalanor, seeding it with lush vegetation in the form of gigantic trees and transforming all of Despero's followers in space into trees as well. It then claimed Despero himself, pulling him deep underground into the planet's core, never to be seen again.
