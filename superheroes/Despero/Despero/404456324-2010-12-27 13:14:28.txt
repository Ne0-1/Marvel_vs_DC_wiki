==Fictional character biography==
Despero first appears when in pursuit of two rebels from the planet Kalanor, which he rules as a [[tyrant]]. The rebels make contact with the [[Justice League of America]], with member [[Barry Allen|Flash]] accepting Despero's challenge and defeating him in a game similar to [[chess]]. Despero is then imprisoned and Kalanor is freed.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #1 (Oct. 1960)</ref> 

The villain eventually escapes his prison and in revenge ages half of the Justice League and banishes the remainder to other worlds. When Despero attempts to deceive [[Wonder Woman]], she overpowers the villain and forces him to undo his actions.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #26 (March 1964)</ref> Despero is thwarted again when the Justice League intervene in his intergalactic plans of conquest,<ref>''Justice League of America'' #133-134 (Aug.-Sept. 1976)</ref> and save member the [[Martian Manhunter]] who is being forced to play in a life and death chess match.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #177 - 178 (April–May 1980)</ref>

Despero eventually returns with even greater abilities, and completely destroys the Justice League Satellite. After defeating the Justice League, Despero reshapes [[Gotham City]] to suit his purposes. Taunted by Batman, Despero is eventually distracted, allowing fellow member [[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]] to extinguish the "Flame of Py'tar", the source of Despero's power. The villain's form is immediately dispelled and reality restores itself.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #247 - 250 (Feb.-May 1986); #251-254 (June-Sept. 1986)</ref>

Despero eventually reforms, and targets the Justice League member [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]]. After murdering Gypsy's parents, Despero is about to kill her when the Martian Manhunter intervenes. The villain quickly defeats the Manhunter, although fellow Justice League member [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Gardner]] arrives and hurls Despero away. Despero attacks the League at their headquarters, and kills the [[coma]]tose [[Commander Steel|Steel]] (on life support for injuries sustained during a battle against the [[Android (robot)|android]]s of [[Professor Ivo]]<ref>''Justice League of America'' #260 (March 1987)</ref>). When Despero is about to murder the [[Ted Kord|Blue Beetle]], the Martian Manhunter bestows upon him the gift of "Mayavanna": a sacred Martian rite that provides the subject with a reality in which they obtain their desires. Despero sees himself killing the entire League and destroying the world, and is immediately at peace. The villain then reverts Despero into a [[fetus]], and is eventually given to trader [[Manga Khan]] in exchange for his servant robot, [[L-Ron]].<ref>''Justice League America'' vol. 2, #37-40 (April–July 1990)</ref> 

A re-aged Despero is angered by this defeat and escapes form Manga Khan, returning to Earth to battle the Justice League. Unknown to Despero, Kahn hires the [[bounty hunter]] [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] to recapture him. Despero engages the Justice League, [[Justice League Europe]], and Lobo in [[Times Square]], [[New York]], and keeps them all at bay. A desperate [[Green Lantern]] [[Kilowog]] and L-Ron use the slave collar Despero still wears to switch minds with L-Ron, with the diminutive robot's body being destroyed shortly afterwards. Now in Despero's body, L-Ron returns to Manga Khan.<ref>''Justice League Europe'' #30 - 34 (Sept. 1991-Jan. 1992)</ref>

L-Ron reappeared, still in Despero's body, and had a number of adventures with the ''[[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]''<ref>''Justice League Task Force'' #0 (Oct. 1994); #13-33 (June 1994-March 1996) and #37 (Aug. 1996)</ref> and ''[[Justice League International]]''.<ref>''Justice League International'' #67-68(Aug.-Sept. 1994)</ref> Despero returns in spirit form, and temporarily repossesses his old form until stopped by the heroine ''[[Supergirl]]''.<ref>''Supergirl'' vol. 4, #17-18 (Jan.-Feb. 1998)</ref> The villain makes a second attempt to return to a corporeal state, possessing the Martian Manhunter. The team [[Young Justice]], however, use the Manhunter's fear of fire against him and team ally the [[Secret (comics)|Secret]] banishes Despero's spirit form.<ref>''Young Justice'' #6 (March 1999)</ref>

Despero's spirit eventually returns with the aid of [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] villain [[Johnny Sorrow]], and takes over the body of [[Lex Luthor]], currently [[President of the United States]]. Together they release the [[Seven Deadly Enemies of Man|Seven Deadly Sins]] which possess several members of the JLA and JSA, and neutralize the [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]]. The remainder of the teams successfully drive the Sins from their comrades, and eventually defeat both Sorrow and Despero, who is driven from Luthor when exposed to Sorrow's lethal stare.<ref>''JLA/JSA: Virtue and Vice'' (Dec. 2002)</ref> The villain returns as the guiding force behind a new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and allows them to remember they once learnt the Justice League's identities. Although Despero takes mental control of several of the League, he is eventually stopped by Green Lantern and imprisoned on the planet [[Oa]].<ref>''JLA'' #116 - 119 (Sept.- Nov. 2005)</ref>

Having allied himself with a race that destroys species unworthy of survival, Despero attempts to convince them to destroy Earth by using an alien substance known as the 'Blackrock' to influence Earth's alien superhumans- [[Martian Manhunter]], [[Supergirl]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], etc.- to turn against humanity by playing n their occasional feelings of isolation. However, his efforts are foiled when [[Batman]] exposes himself to the blackrock while under attack by Superman, the sight of his friend's contamination helping Superman to recognise what is happening to him, allowing Superman to confront the aliens directly and convince them that Despero deceived them.<ref>Superman/Batman'' #33 (March 2007)</ref> Despero returned in his original human form when plucked from the timestream by [[Mister Mind]], and is convinced to join a group called "The Time Stealers". The villains successfully create an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] that differs significantly from the original. Hero [[Booster Gold]] and several allies ([[Rip Hunter]] and the [[Justice League International]]) eventually undo the change and restore the original universe.<ref>''Booster Gold'' 5; (Feb. 2008); #7-10 (April-Aug. 2008)</ref>

Despero briefly allied with villains [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine Le Fey]] and [[Enigma (DC Comics)|Enigma]] and became god-like until stopped by the combined efforts of [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]].<ref>''Trinity'' #4 (June 2008)</ref> Despero returns to attack the Justice League, but when teleported away by member [[Zatanna]], is imprisoned on [[Oa]] once again.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 2, #38 (Dec. 2009)</ref> 

At the request of human computer [[Vril Dox]], Despero joins in the fight against the original [[Starro]] (a humanoid), that controls all other versions and is conquering the galaxy. Despero engages Starro in combat and although easily destroyed begins to regenerate into a superior form, which was always the villain's intent. Vril Dox uses Despero's still living head as a weapon against Starro and its forces.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S'' #12 - 13 (March–April 2010).

==Powers and abilities==
Despero is an alien from the planet Kalanor, and in addition to a genius intellect possesses a third eye on his forehead capable of [[hypnotism]], [[illusion]]s, [[telekinesis]], and [[telepathy]]. Despero is also empowered by the "Flame of Py'tar", a mystical source of power that grants superior strength, durability, and the ability to alter his mass (from human-sized to massive).

==In other media==
===Television===
* Despero appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hearts and Minds" voiced by [[Keith David]]. In this incarnation, Despero is a native of the harsh desert planet of Kalanor. Born with a third eye, he was outcast. In his travels through the desert, he stumbled upon the Flame of Py'tar, which gave him the ability to control the minds of others and project powerful energy blasts that could overpower [[Green Lantern]]s. He built up an army of followers empowered by the Py'tar, defeated several members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], and threatened to spread his fanatical crusade across the galaxy. It is eventually discovered that the Flame of Py'tar is actually the dormant life-force of Kalanor. The [[Martian Manhunter]] allows it to speak through his body, thereby exposing Despero as a fraud while releasing the Py'tar. The Py'tar then spread its power across Kalanor, seeding it with lush vegetation. Despero's followers traveling the universe are transformed into trees that fall to the nearby planets.
