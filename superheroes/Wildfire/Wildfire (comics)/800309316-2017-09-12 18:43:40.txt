'''Wildfire''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Cary Bates]] and [[Dave Cockrum]], the character debuted in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes|Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' #195 (June 1973). The story is set in a fictional universe's 30th and 31st centuries.

==Publication history==
Wildfire was immediately popular with readers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} At that time, the editors of ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' held periodic elections in which readers could choose the Legion's leader. Soon after his introduction, Wildfire was elected to that post. In-story, Wildfire actually lost the election to [[Superboy]], but as no candidate had received a majority of the votes, the membership decided that the Legion needed a member who was available full-time rather than the [[time travel]]ling, part-time Kryptonian member.

{{Plot|date=April 2009}}
Wildfire was originally Drake Burroughs, an astroengineer. While he was working on a new propulsion system, the unit's safety valve snapped and discharged a blast of anti-matter energy. Burroughs was engulfed and his body disintegrated instantly. However, his consciousness somehow survived, and he found himself transformed into a being of pure anti-energy. Fortunately, his colleagues had on hand a "containment suit" that could be used to keep Drake's anti-energy from dispersing. Once confined to a specific area, Drake's energy form stabilized and became self-regenerating. He again possessed a semblance of [[humanoid]] form; however, he had no true human form and lacked most human sensory functions, such as taste or touch. 

Drake's new form had vast super-powers, the most potent of which was the power to fire energy blasts. He was originally reluctant to use that ability due to an accident in which he nearly killed his former girlfriend. Calling himself ERG-1 (Energy Release Generator 1), Drake decided to petition for membership in the Legion. To his surprise, he was turned down because the abilities he demonstrated simply duplicated those of other members such as [[Mon-El]], [[Colossal Boy]], and [[Chemical King]]; at that time, Legion's by-laws required that each member possess at least one superpower no other active member had. Drake had not demonstrated his energy-blasting or manipulation abilities because he was afraid he could not control them safely. Still, anxious to prove his abilities, he followed several Legionnaires on a mission to the planet Manna-5, during which Colossal Boy was knocked unconscious by an enemy machine and none of the other Legionnaires present had the power to save him. ERG-1 destroyed the machine, but expelled all his energy from his containment suit. Because his energy form was invisible, the Legionnaires assumed he had been killed in saving Colossal Boy and that his power could only be used once.

However, ERG-1 was alive. By now, his energy form was stable enough so that he could survive without his suit, though he could neither take humanoid form nor communicate with anyone. He followed the Legionnaires back to Earth where they put his containment suit on display. Upon reaching the Legionnaires' headquarters, he managed to regain the suit and save the Legion from another menace. He was then admitted to the team and adopted the name Wildfire.

Over time, Wildfire lost many of his powers. This was partly because of the trauma of the explosive exit from his containment suit. In addition, his original containment suit was eventually destroyed and subsequent copies were not as versatile. His later suits were also not nearly as durable and it was easier to cause him to be expelled from it. Even so, he always retained his flight, energy absorption, energy projection, and super strength, and was commonly considered among the four most powerful Legionnaires along with [[Superboy]], [[Mon-El]] and [[Ultra Boy]].

Initially, Wildfire and Superboy were rivals and actually fought over the position of team leader. Wildfire acquitted himself well in that battle, establishing that his raw power was comparable to a Kryptonian's. As leader, Wildfire got mixed reviews. Though he was decisive and a gifted tactician, his poor people skills swiftly alienated many of his fellow members (though not, ironically, Superboy; at the conclusion of a particularly rough crisis, he told his one-time rival that he had become "one hell of a leader."){{citation needed|reason=I don't think Superboy would've used such language|date=July 2014}} He led the Legion through the [[Earthwar]] and [[Omega (comics)|Omega]] crises but was defeated for re-election by [[Lightning Lad]].

Shortly after becoming leader, Wildfire recruited a young Amerindian mutant, [[Dawnstar]]. He soon became enamored of her, but for years theirs was a [[love-hate relationship]]. It was clear to their teammates that they were extremely fond of each other, if not actively in love, but Dawnstar would not admit to her feelings. Wildfire, in return, was often [[passive-aggressive]] in his treatment of her. It was eventually revealed that Dawnstar did reciprocate his feelings. However, she feared that she would never know physical love since Wildfire did not possess a physical body.

Some time later, the Legion admitted an extra-[[dimension]]al being named [[Quislet]]. Like Wildfire, Quislet was an entity of pure energy and required a containment device to survive on Earth; unlike Wildfire, though, Quislet's condition was natural to his species. He taught Wildfire how to control his energy form without needing the containment suit. In this new form, Wildfire was much closer to human, being visible, tangible, and possessing facial features. However, his body was still so hot that his mere touch burned Dawnstar. The two [[star-crossed]] lovers attempted to consummate their passion, but Wildfire could not bear to cause his beloved pain (though she was willing to attempt to bear it). He might have attained greater control of his temperature given further lessons with Quislet, but before he could do so, Quislet's own containment device was destroyed and he was forced to return to his own dimension. Quislet had been surreptitiously assisting Wildfire to maintain physical form, and after he left, Wildfire quickly lost the ability to maintain his form. He resumed use of the containment suit. He remained in that form for some time; eventually, in post-Crisis continuity, he used his powers to reignite Earth's sun, and eventually his consciousness ended up in [[Sun Boy]]'s corpse, a condition he maintained until the Legion reboot.

Following Zero Hour, Wildfire was absent from Legion comics for some years, and when he returned, it was with a drastically different origin.

In a fight with [[Mordru]], '''Atom'X''' (Randall Burroughs) and '''Blast-Off''' (Jahr-Drake Ningle), members of the [[Uncanny Amazers]] and [[Workforce (comics)|Workforce]] respectively, were seemingly killed by the villain. However, some time later, several Legionnaires noticed energy patterns in the area, and [[Umbra (comics)|Umbra]] was able to contain the energy long enough for them to realize that it was sentient. However, when they retrieved it to a laboratory they found it contained the inseparable minds of both Atom'X and Blast-Off. Although Umbra in particular was disgusted by the forced integration, they successfully contained the energy long enough to create a containment suit for it, and the new being took the name '''Drake Burroughs''' after his forebears and the codename '''ERG-1'''.

Shortly afterward, ERG-1 was one of the Legionnaires [[Legion Lost|lost]] in a spatial rift - although he suffered a traumatic experience as his containment suit was ripped open by the rift.

When [[Element Lad]] had returned the other Legionnaires to normal space, albeit becoming separated from them in time in the process, ERG-1's energy leeched into space too, congealing as a "star" noticed by [[Shikari Lonestar|Shikari]]'s nomadic people, the Kwai, which led her to discover and accidentally revive the other Legionnaires, who had been held in suspended animation. Soon afterward, while the Legionnaires met the Kwai, [[Kid Quantum]] noticed that the "feral star" the Kwai had been following was in fact ERG-1. [[Brainiac 5]], with the Kwai's help and materials, managed to create a new containment suit for him, restoring a semblance of form to him. In addition, the time spent alone in space had merged his two minds into one. Shortly afterward, he took the name '''Wildfire''' after a mistranslation by Shikari.

Some time after they returned to their home galaxy, however, he was captured by [[Qward]] and used to power their whole planet for a considerable period. Though his power was great, it was finite, and after his rescue, he was left so weakened by the experience that the threat of running out of energy became a real and ongoing threat to him.

==="Threeboot"===
Drake was eventually introduced into the "Threeboot" continuity in the "Quest for Cosmic Boy" storyline. This version of Drake has the same abilities as the previous versions, and his containment suit is identical to the one he used in pre-''Zero Hour'' continuity. This version of E.R.G.-1 was believed to have been destroyed when his containment suit ruptured during his try-out mission. However, his energy was collected and reconstituted by his brother Randall. This E.R.G.-1 was manipulated by his brother to become an assassin, but that was eventually stopped by [[Brainiac 5]] and [[Salu Digby|Atom Girl]].<ref>''Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #34-35</ref> He was later seen fighting the creatures from the Intruder Planet.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #50 (March 2009)</ref>

===One year later===
A version of Drake resembling his original incarnation appears in "[[The Lightning Saga]]" crossover in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) and ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2), unwillingly masquerading as a statue in the [[Fortress of Solitude]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #5</ref> He reveals that his containment suit is actually the [[Red Tornado]]'s robotic shell<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #9</ref> and indicates that he has at least some of the Red Tornado's memories.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #10</ref>

By the end of ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'', this version of Drake has finally entered into a relationship with Dawnstar.

===New 52===
In DC's [[New 52]] reboot, Wildfire, along with Dawnstar, [[Chameleon Girl]], [[Tellus (comics)|Tellus]], [[Tyroc]], [[Gates (comics)|Gates]], and [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] are all stranded in the 21st Century after apprehending a time-travelling terrorist. This new series, also  titled ''Legion Lost'' ran for 16 issues and dealt with the characters' feelings of being trapped in a (to them) primitive society and having to fit in while not changing their future. In this version Wildfire wore a more armor-like suit of red & black instead of the original orange and red.
In the ''[[The New 52: Futures End|Future's End: 5 Years Later]]'' event, he is revealed to have joined, and left, the [[Justice League]].

==Equipment==
As a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] he is provided a [[Legion Flight Ring]]. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.

==Other versions==
*A version of Drake appeared in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' Annual #7, under the ''[[Legends of the Dead Earth]]'' banner. This Drake claims to be the last living Legionnaire from the long dead planet Earth, his energy powers having rendered him immortal. Drake's origin is much the same as his original counterpart. While the book implied that this was the future of the post-Zero Hour Legion, Drake's backstory conflicts too greatly with that of the version of Wildfire that was introduced in later in the series, along with certain elements that never occurred in the main series, such as the introduction of Quislet and Reflecto, and a new character called Galaxy Girl, into the Legion. This Drake has led various teams of Legionnaires in battle against a group of terrorists who have been blowing up stars and planets in order to keep the rest of the universe separated from one another, but the members he recruits continue to die on their missions because of their prejudices. The only three surviving members who still aid him are Rimborians, Gizi and Ziga, and an alien named Membrain. Drake, up until that point, suffered some memory loss, and by undergoing sensory deprivation and having them restored, he decided to recruit teenagers. This is a successful move, as his new team is able to stop the terrorist group, revealed to be [[Durla]]ns, from destroying any more stars and move on to help reunite the universe as the United Planets.
*A version of Drake called '''Erg''' plays a [[Tin Woodsman]]-esque role in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' Annual #5, ''The Long Road Home''. The story was released under the [[Elseworlds]] banner.
* An ancestor of [[Dawnstar]], known as [[Wildstar (DC Comics)|Wildstar]] is a member of the 21st century hero team [[R.E.B.E.L.S.]]. She has the combined powers of Dawnstar and Wildfire.

==In other media==
Wildfire appeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Far From Home".  He has a small, non-speaking part.

He later appears in the second (2007â€“2008) season of the [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|animated ''Legion'' TV series]], in the episode "Dark Victory, part 1", fighting off [[Imperiex]]'s forces. According with producer [[James Tucker (producer)|James Tucker]], Wildfire would have replace Kell-El as a member of the Legion if the show had been renewed for a third season.<ref>http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bravebold/backstage/interviews/wftucker.php</ref>
