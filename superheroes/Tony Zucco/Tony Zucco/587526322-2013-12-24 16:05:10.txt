'''Anthony "Tony" Zucco''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. He was introduced in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (April 1940) and is best known for his connections to the origin of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

==Fictional character history==
===Pre-Crisis===
Antonio Zucco (originally just '''"Boss Zucco"''' in his first appearance) is a [[Mafia]] boss, or simple low level thug (his position of power varies depending upon the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]) in [[Gotham City]] who is responsible for the death of [[Dick Grayson]]'s parents. 

Throughout the years, Zucco's role in Robin's origin remains largely the same. Zucco tries to extort the Haly's Circus, where the Flying Graysons are the main attraction. When the ringmaster Mr. Haly (who runs an honest business) refuses to pay him [[extortion|protection money]], Zucco sabotages the trapeze ropes the Graysons use in their act. The ropes break while Dick's parents are in mid-air. Because the Graysons perform their act without a [[safety net]], they fall to their deaths. 

Dick is subsequently [[adoption|adopted]] by Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. [[Batman]]) and becomes his partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Both of them locate Tony Zucco and send him to jail. In the Golden Age version, he is sent to the [[electric chair]]. In the Silver Age version, he is sentenced to [[life in prison]].

===Post-Crisis===
====''Batman: Year Three''====
Having been sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the Grayson murders, Zucco is incarcerated in Blackgate Penitentiary. After serving seven years of his sentence, he files for a [[parole]] hearing and offers testimony against other Gotham criminals. He professes remorse for his crimes, but hides an ulterior motive. Before he was sent to prison, Zucco had hidden a ledger in the orphanage where Dick briefly resided following his parents' deaths; the ledger contains incriminating information about the Mafia's operations in Gotham. Zucco plots to remove the ledger from the oprhanage before it is demolished. Wanting to keep the truth from Dick (who has recently became [[Nightwing]]), [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] goes to the parole hearing and pleads for the judge to keep Zucco in prison. Unfortunately, Dick learns of Zucco's release. Despite Alfred's attempts to stop him, Dick races to Blackgate to confront his parents' killer. However, as he steps out of the prison, Zucco is gunned down by a helicopter hired by a rival crime boss. While Zucco's death gives Dick some [[closure (psychology)|closure]], his already-strained relationship with Batman becomes further complicated. Bruce insists he knew nothing about Zucco's murder.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #436-439 (August-September 1989)</ref>

====''Batman: Dark Victory''====
In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', Zucco (dubbed '''Anthony "Fats" Zucco''') is portrayed as a low-level thug working for [[Sal Maroni]], a member of [[Carmine Falcone]]'s Mafia empire. He and another minor family head, Edward Skeevers, are put in charge of [[drug trafficking]]. After constant attacks by other enemies such as [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], Zucco starts a new method of smuggling these drugs. He only lets Skeevers in on the secret, believing that its success will make their minor families greater than the Falcones and the Maronis put together, and attempts to take over Haley's Circus in order to use its trucks for his trafficking activities. He kills Dick Grayson's parents as a demonstration of power to the circus' owner, and then quickly goes underground. He is later found by Batman and Dick Grayson, who is not yet Robin, and is chased down a dark alley by Grayson until he has a [[heart attack]], confessing to various crimes.<ref>''Batman: Dark Victory'' #0-13 (November 1999 - December 2000)</ref>

====''Blackest Night''====
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
Tony Zucco's remains have been reanimated as a [[Black Lantern]] in DC Comics' 2009/2010 crossover ''[[Blackest Night]],'' with John and Mary Grayson, [[Jack Drake|Jack]] and Janet Drake, [[Captain Boomerang]], and the original Dark Knight's deceased rogue gallery members. They all attempt to take the lives of Dick Grayson and [[Tim Drake]], who became the new Batman and [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]. Grayson eventually cryogenically suspended himself and Drake during the battle, which forced the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life from them.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (December 2009)</ref> This Zucco has an appearance similar to his depiction in Dark Victory.

====''The Black Mirror''====
It is eventually revealed that Zucco had fathered a daughter named Sonia. Unlike her father, she is a seemingly a legitimate businesswoman and runs the GGM Bank under the alias of Sonia Branch.<ref>''Detective Comics'' (vol. 1) #876 (April 2011)</ref> Batman (Dick Grayson), who initially hoped that Sonia is not as corrupted as her father, is disappointed when he realizes that Sonia manipulated him into subduing rivals who wish to take over her bank. Due to the lack of evidence, Sonia remains beyond the reach of the law.<ref>''Detective Comics'' (vol. 1) #878 (August 2011)</ref>

==Other versions==
===All Star Batman and Robin===
In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'', Grayson's parents are killed by a low-level [[hitman]] called '''"Jocko-boy" Vanzetti'''. Throughout the early issues, he is toyed with and brutalized by Batman (even coating his [[batarangs]] with [[snake poison]]).<ref>''All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder'' #1 (September 2005)</ref> Later, he is brought to the [[Batcave]], to be tortured and interrogated by Dick Grayson (at one point with an axe) while Batman looks on. During this period, he reveals that [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] ordered the hit.<ref>''All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder'' #7 (November 2005)</ref> Afterwards, he is thrown into Gotham Bay with his hands tied behind his back.<ref>''All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder'' #8 (January 2008)</ref>

As in the comics, he threatens Haley's Circus' owner Mr. Haley for protection money and kills Dick Grayson's parents by sabotaging the trapeze ropes. Batman, who as Bruce Wayne adopts Dick, goes after Zucco with a vengeance. After a couple of brief run-ins with Batman, an increasingly paranoid Zucco escapes town, but returns nine years later. Batman tries to handle it on his own, not wanting Robin to get involved. when Robin learns that his parents' murderer is back in town, he goes after Zucco on his own, ultimately saving Batman's life. Robin is briefly tempted to kill Zucco, but ultimately spares him and leaves him to be arrested.

* Tony Zucco appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "A Matter of Family" voiced by [[Mark Hamill]].

His brothers are a [[Strongman (circus)|strong man]] (referred to in the credits as '''Bruiser'''), a [[Lion taming|lion tamer]], and a [[Juggling|juggler]]. Tony Zucco's skill is [[knife throwing]]. As a child, he was part of a knife-throwing duo with his father, with Tony throwing the knives while his father was bound to the giant target. One night, he missed, killing his father. When John Grayson appears in the tent near the Grayson's trailer and Zucco offers his "protection", John refuses. John Grayson is attacked by Zucco's brothers. Dick calls the police minutes after Zucco first appears in their big top tent. The call is intercepted by Batman, who quickly arrives and takes Zucco and his brothers down. The police arrive and take Zucco's "Lion Tamer" brother away while Zucco and the other two brothers escape. Swearing revenge on Batman and the Graysons, Zucco tampers with the railings of the Graysons' trapeze act, resulting in the deaths of Dick's parents. After the Graysons' murder, Batman corners every one of Zucco's remaining brothers until he learns their boss' whereabouts, which turns out to be Haley's Circus. When Zucco knocks Batman out at Haley's Circus, he straps the Dark Knight to a knife-throwing wheel. Dick arrives in his Robin costume just in time and battles Zucco long enough for Batman to free himself. At one point, Dick has the chance to enact revenge on Zucco for the murder of his parents when Zucco falls from the same platform as the Flying Graysons.
