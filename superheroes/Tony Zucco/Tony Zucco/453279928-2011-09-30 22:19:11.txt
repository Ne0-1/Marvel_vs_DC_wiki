'''Anthony "Tony" Zucco''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. He was introduced in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (April 1940) and is best known for his connections to the origin of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

==Fictional character history==
===Pre-Crisis===
Antonio Zucco (originally just '''"Boss Zucco"''' in his first appearance) is a [[Mafia]] boss, or simple low level thug (his position of power varies depending upon the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]) in [[Gotham City]] who is responsible for the death of [[Dick Grayson]]'s parents. 

Throughout the years, Zucco's role in Robin's origin remains largely the same. Zucco tries to extort the Haley's Circus, where the Flying Graysons are the main attraction. When the ringmaster, Mr. Haley (who runs an honest business), refuses to pay him [[extortion|protection money]], Zucco sabotages the ropes the Graysons use in their act. The ropes break while Dick's parents are in mid-air and, because the Graysons perform their act without a [[safety net]], they fall to their deaths. 

Dick is subsequently [[adoption|adopted]] by Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. [[Batman]]) and becomes his partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Both of them locate Tony Zucco and send him to jail. In the Golden Age [[canon (fiction)|canon]], he is sent to the [[electric chair]], whereas he is sent to [[life in prison|prison for life]] in the Silver Age version.

===Post-Crisis===
====''Batman: Dark Victory''====
In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', Zucco (dubbed '''Anthony "Fats" Zucco''') is portrayed as a low-level thug working for [[Sal Maroni]], a member of [[Carmine Falcone]]'s Mafia empire. He and another minor family head, Edward Skeevers, are put in charge of [[drug trafficking]]. After constant attacks by other enemies such as [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], Zucco starts a new method of smuggling these drugs. He only lets Skeevers in on the secret, believing that its success will make their minor families greater than the Falcones and the Maronis put together, and attempts to take over Haley's Circus in order to use its trucks for his trafficking activities. He kills Dick Grayson's parents as a demonstration of power to the circus' owner, and then quickly goes underground. He is later found by Batman and Dick Grayson, who is not yet Robin, and is chased down a dark alley by Grayson until he has a [[heart attack]], confessing to various crimes.

====''Batman: Year Three''====

Having been sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the Grayson murders, Zucco is incarcerated in Blackgate Penitentiary. After serving seven years of his sentence, he files for a [[parole]] hearing and offers testimony against other Gotham criminals. He professes remorse for his crimes, but hides an ulterior motive. Before he was sent to prison, Zucco had hidden a ledger in the orphanage where Dick briefly resided following his parents' deaths; the ledger contains incriminating information about the Mafia's operations in Gotham. Zucco plots to remove the ledger from the oprhanage before it is demolished. Wanting to keep the truth from Dick—who has recently became [[Nightwing]]—[[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] goes to the parole hearing and pleads for the judge to keep Zucco in prison. Unfortunately, Dick learns of Zucco's release and, despite Alfred's attempts to stop him, races to Blackgate to confront his parents' killer. However, as he steps out of the prison, Zucco is gunned down by a helicopter hired by a rival crime boss. While Zucco's death gives Dick some [[closure (psychology)|closure]], his already-strained relationship with Batman becomes further complicated. Bruce insists he knew nothing about Zucco's parole.

===Blackest Night===
Tony Zucco's remains have been reanimated as a [[Black Lantern]] in DC Comics' 2009/2010 crossover ''[[Blackest Night]],'' with John and Mary Grayson, [[Jack Drake|Jack]] and Janet Drake, [[Captain Boomerang]], and the original Dark Knight's deceased rogue gallery members. They all attempt to take the lives of Dick Grayson and [[Tim Drake]], who became the new Batman and [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]. Grayson eventually cryogenically suspended himself and Drake during the battle, which forced the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life from them.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' (December 2009) #3</ref>  This Zucco has an appearance similar to his depiction in Dark Victory.

===The Black Mirror===
It is eventually revealed that Tony had fathered a daughter named '''Sonia Zucco'''. Unlike her father, she is a legitimate businesswoman and runs the GGM Bank under the alias of Sonia Branch.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #876 (April 2011)</ref>

==Other versions==
===All Star Batman and Robin===
In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'', Grayson's parents are killed by a low-level [[hitman]] called '''"Jocko-boy" Vanzetti'''. Throughout the early issues, he is toyed with and brutalized by Batman. Later, he is brought to the [[Batcave]], to be tortured and interrogated by Dick Grayson—at one point with an axe—while Batman looks on. During this period, he reveals that [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] ordered the hit. Afterwards, he is thrown into Gotham Bay with his hands tied behind his back.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Tony Zucco appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Robin's Reckoning" voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]. Tony Zucco starts off as a young man eager to make a name for himself in the [[racketeering]] business. On the side he strong arms companies to pay him protection money. As in the comics, he threatens Haley's Circus, and kills Dick Grayson's parents. Zucco's brashness infuriates his uncle mob boss [[Arnold Stromwell]] who disowns him after Batman's visit to his house. Batman, who as Bruce Wayne adopts the young Grayson, goes after Zucco with a vengeance. After a couple of brief run-ins with Batman, Zucco escapes and hides out in a condemned building on the edge of Gotham. Nine years later, Batman and Robin catch up with one of Zucco's henchman, and learn that the mobster has returned to the city. Batman tries to handle it on his own, not wanting Robin to get involved in it. Upset at Batman's orders, Robin goes after Zucco anyway, despite Alfred's protests. Batman goes to the amusement park and finds Zucco, but injures his leg, and is forced to fight the henchmen with his injury. Batman defeats everyone but Zucco, who stands over Batman with a machine gun once his henchmen are defeated, but Robin shows up on his motorcycle and drags Zucco to the edge of a pier where they fight. Batman comes up behind them, and manages to calm Robin down. Robin apologizes to Batman, and throws Zucco back onto the pier. After this fight with Batman and Robin, Zucco is arrested. Batman explains that he distanced Robin from the investigation because he did not want Zucco to hurt him any more.

* Tony Zucco appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "A Matter of Family" voiced by [[Mark Hamill]] (who voiced [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series''). In this version, Zucco has three brothers who act as his underlings and acts as Gotham's Mafia Don. They are all involved in circus acts. His brothers are a strong man (referred to in the credits as Bruiser), a lion tamer, and a juggler. Zucco's skill is knife-throwing. In his childhood he works in the circus as part of a knife-throwing duo with his father, with Zucco throwing the knives while his father is bound to the giant target. One night, he misses, killing his father. When John Grayson appears in the tent near the Grayson's trailer and Zucco offers protection money, John refuses. John Grayson is attacked by Zucco's brothers. Dick calls the police minutes after Zucco first appears in their big top tent. The call is intercepted by Batman who quickly arrive and takes Zucco and his brothers down. The police arrive and take the "Lion Tamer" away while Zucco and the other two brothers escape. Swearing revenge on Batman and the Graysons for the loss of his brother, Zucco plans to kill the Graysons by removing two nuts from the railings of the Graysons' trapeze act. After the Graysons' murder, Batman corners every one of Zucco's brothers until he learns their boss' whereabouts, which turns out to be Haley's Circus. When Zucco knocks out Batman at Haley's Circus, he straps the Dark Knight to a knife-throwing wheel and recounts his childhood in the circus. Dick arrives in his Robin costume just in time and battles him long enough for Batman to free himself. At one point Dick has the chance to enact revenge on Zucco for the murder of his parents when Zucco falls from the same platform as the Flying Graysons. Dick chooses to spare Zucco who is then arrested by the police. Afterward, Dick Grayson officially becomes Batman's sidekick Robin.
