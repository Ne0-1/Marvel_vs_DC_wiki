'''Shang-Chi''' ({{zh|t=上氣|p=shàng qì|l=rising of the spirit}}) is a fictional character, often called the "Master of [[Kung Fu]]", appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]]. Shang-Chi is an extraordinary master of numerous unarmed and weaponry-based [[Chinese martial arts|wushu]] styles, including the use of the ''[[Gun (staff)|gun]]'', ''[[nunchaku]]'' and ''[[jian]]''. He later, upon joining the Avengers, ultimately gains the power to create countless duplicates of himself.

==Publication history==
The character was conceived in late 1972. Marvel had wished to acquire the rights to adapt the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television program, but were denied permission by the show's owner, Time Warner, owner of DC Comics. Marvel acquired the comic book rights to [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp villain [[Dr. Fu Manchu]] instead.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|title= A success written in the stars|date= March 3, 2001|publisher= Universo HQ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125065341/http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|archivedate= November 25, 2010|deadurl= yes}}</ref> They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 161|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer Steve Englehart and artist/co-plotter Jim Starlin created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

Shang-Chi first appeared in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 (December 1973) by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin.<ref>{{cite book| last = Cooke| first = Jon B.| title = Comic Book Artist Collection: Volume 3| publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2005|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|pages = 6–7|chapter= Everybody was Kung Fu Watchin'!

Shang-Chi appeared again in issue #16, and with issue #17 (April 1974) the title was changed to ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu]]''. Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a run including four giant-size issues and an annual. He co-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''Giant-Size Spider-Man'' #2<ref name="Manning">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 76|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Written by Len Wein with art by Ross Andru, this story saw Shang-Chi and Spidey being manipulated into mistaking each other for an enemy.}}</ref> and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #84 and 85. Shang-Chi teamed up with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #29. ''Special Collector's Edition'' #1 (1975) cover titled as "Savage Fists of Kung Fu" reprinted stories from ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #1-2; ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu Special'' #1; and ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2265|title= Special Collector's Edition}}</ref> He did several crossovers with other Marvel martial artists, including [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Daughters of the Dragon]] ([[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]]). He appeared regularly in ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''.

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the ''Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black'' one-shot (1990) and the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse'' (2002) with artist Paul Gulacy on art again. The character had two stories in the [[anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' including one by Moench that ran in the series' first eight issues in 1988, and co-starred in the ''[[Moon Knight]] Special'' (1992). In 1997 a story arc starring Shang-Chi ran in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #514-516, and was intended to lead into a mini-series for the character in 1998.<ref>{{cite news | last = Middaugh | first= Dallas | date = August 1997 | title = ''Journey into Mystery'' to Launch New Titles | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 23}}</ref>

Although spun out of licensed properties, Shang-Chi is a Marvel-owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as ''Marvel Team-Up'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''. Most of the original, licensed, characters in the supporting cast have been phased out in the more recent series and stories.

In some of his modern appearances, mention is made of his villainous father either in cryptic terms or using a variety of new names, due to Marvel no longer having the rights to Fu Manchu. In ''Secret Avengers'' #6-10, writer Ed Brubaker officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where a rogue group of S.H.I.E.L.D agents resurrect a zombified version of Fu Manchu only to discover that "Fu Manchu" was only an alias; that Shang-Chi's father was really an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality.

Shang-Chi returned as a main character in the 2007 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' comic book, and both he and several characters of his supporting cast appear in that year's ''[[Pete Wisdom|Wisdom]]'' miniseries.

Shang-Chi appeared in ''Wolverine: First Class'' #9, where [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] approached him for advice in order to defeat his nemesis, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].

===Return===
Some time later, Shang-Chi returned from China, and rejoined Tarr, Reston, and Wu. They battled Argus' terroristic group, formed to cause the United States to act more aggressively against all terrorists.

===Heroes for Hire===
As a member of the restored [[Heroes for Hire]], Shang-Chi had put his strength of character at the service of their teammates.

Still working for MI6, he goes on to collaborate with [[Pete Wisdom]] of MI-13 in facing the [[Welsh dragon]], which had turned amnesiac and become a human crime lord. Shang-Chi had been told by Wisdom that the dragon (being inherently noble) would go free once it remembered its true origins, and was embittered to find this had been a lie.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]|penciller= [[Manuel Garcia (comics)|Garcia, Manuel]]|inker= [[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]|story= The Rudiments of Wisdom Part Three: Enter With Dragon|title= [[Pete Wisdom|Wisdom]]|issue= 3|date= April 2007}}</ref> He became the tutor of a young Earth-616 [[Killraven]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Cornell, Paul|penciller= Garcia, Manuel|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= The Rudiments of Wisdom Part Six: Look Out, Here Comes Tomorrow|title=Wisdom|issue= 6|date= July 2007}}</ref>

When the Illuminati were exposed to have tampered with the mind of Captain America and attempting to destroy worlds threatening Earth as part of the Incursions as seen in the ''[[Time Runs Out]]'' storyline, Shang-Chi joined a faction of the Avengers led by Sunspot.{{issue|date=May 2016}} Sunspot's Avengers, having taken control over AIM, discovered that "incursion points" (points where an Incursion world that is about to hit Earth can be seen) were causing a massive number of physical mutations among those who stumbled upon the locations.{{issue|date=May 2016}} Sending Shang-Chi to an incursion point in Japan,{{issue|date=May 2016}} Shang-Chi was exposed to cosmic-level radiation that transformed Shang-Chi into a mutate capable of creating duplicates of himself.{{issue|date=May 2016}}

==Powers and abilities==
Although it has never been determined exactly how extensive Shang-Chi's fighting skills are, he has beaten numerous superhuman opponents.  Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty-handed fighter and practitioner of kung fu alive. Much of his physical abilities seem to stem from his mastery of chi, which often allows him to surpass physical limitations of normal athletes.  He has also demonstrated the ability to dodge bullets from machine guns and sniper rifles, and is able to deflect gunshots with his bracers. Shang-Chi is also highly trained in the arts of concentration and meditation, and is an expert in various hand weapons including swords, staves, [[kali stick]]s, nunchaku, and shuriken.

Following exposure to the cosmic radiation from the Incursions, Shang-Chi can now create an infinite number of duplicates of himself.{{issue|date=May 2016}}
