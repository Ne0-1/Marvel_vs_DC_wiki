'''''Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu''''' is a [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] from the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]] featuring Shang-Chi, the son of [[Fu Manchu]], who exhibits extraordinary skills at [[martial arts]].

Shang-Chi was raised by his father to be the ultimate lackey for the would-be world conqueror.  However, his first mission, which was to kill his father's old archenemy, [[Sir Denis Nayland Smith]], ended with him learning the true evil nature of his father.  Disillusioned, Shang-Chi swore eternal opposition to his father's ambitions and fought him as an agent of British intelligence.

The title, originally created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]], was an early success that grew even more with the coming of writer [[Doug Moench]] and artist [[Paul Gulacy]] whose long tenure on the title made the series one of the most acclaimed publications for Marvel in the [[1970s]].

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the ''Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black'' [[graphic novel]] ([[1990]]) and the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''Master of Kung Fu'' ([[2002]]).

Although based on a licensed property, Shang-Chi is a Marvel property and has been firmly established as a part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.
