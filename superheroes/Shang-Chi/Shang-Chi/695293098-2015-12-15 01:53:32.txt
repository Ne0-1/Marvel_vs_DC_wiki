'''Shang-Chi''' ({{zh|t=上氣|p=shàng qì|l=rising of the spirit}}) is a fictional character, often called the "Master of [[Kung Fu]]", appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]]. 

He has no special superpowers, but he exhibits extraordinary skills in the [[martial arts]] and is a master of [[Chinese martial arts|Wushu]] (the actual Mandarin name for the various Chinese fighting arts) both empty handed and with weapons, including the staff, [[nunchaku]] and double-edged sword.

==Publication history==
The character was conceived in late 1972, the publisher wished to acquire the rights to adapt the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television program. Failing to get permission from Time Warner, owner of DC Comics. The publisher acquired the comic book rights to [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp novel villain [[Dr. Fu Manchu]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|title= A success written in the stars|date= March 3, 2001|publisher= Universo HQ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125065341/http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm|archivedate= November 25, 2010|deadurl= yes}}</ref> The result was Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as the previously unheard of son of Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 161|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer Steve Englehart and artist/co-plotter Jim Starlin created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

Shang-Chi first appeared in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 (December 1973) by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin.<ref>{{cite book| last = Cooke| first = Jon B.| title = Comic Book Artist Collection: Volume 3| publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| year = 2005| pages = 6–7|chapter= Everybody was Kung Fu Watchin'!

Shang-Chi appeared again in issue #16, and with issue #17 (April 1974) the title was changed to ''The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu''. Amidst the martial arts craze in the United States in the 1970s, the book became very popular, surviving until issue #125 (June 1983), a run including four giant-size issues and an annual. He co-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''Giant-Size Spider-Man'' #2<ref name="Manning">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 76|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Written by Len Wein with art by Ross Andru, this story saw Shang-Chi and Spidey being manipulated into mistaking each other for an enemy.}}</ref> and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #84 and 85. Shang-Chi teamed up with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #29. ''Special Collector's Edition'' #1 (1975) cover titled as "Savage Fists of Kung Fu" reprinted stories from ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #1-2; ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu Special'' #1; and ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2265|title= Special Collector's Edition}}</ref> He did several crossovers with other Marvel martial artists, including [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Daughters of the Dragon]] ([[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]]). He appeared regularly in ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''.

The series began by introducing Shang-Chi as a man raised by his father Fu Manchu to be the ultimate lackey for the would-be world conqueror. In Shang-Chi's first mission, he kills one of his father's old enemies, Dr. Petrie, and learns of Fu Manchu's true, evil nature. Disillusioned, Shang-Chi swears eternal opposition to his father's ambitions and fights him as an agent of British intelligence, under the orders of Nayland Smith.

The series was an instant sales success. Though Englehart and Starlin soon left as the creative talent for the title, its success grew once writer [[Doug Moench]] and artist [[Paul Gulacy]], began collaborating in issues #22. Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] observed that "Ingenious writing by Doug Moench and energetic art by Paul Gulacy brought ''Master of Kung Fu'' new life."<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Craig was later succeeded by [[Mike Zeck]] who became the regular penciller in issue #64 (1978).

I learned many things from my father: That my name means 'The Rising and Advancing of a Spirit', that my body could be forged into a living weapon through the discipline of kung fu, and that it might be used for the murder of a man called Dr. Petrie.

Since then I have learned that my father is Dr. Fu Manchu, the most insidiously evil man on earth...and that to honor him would bring nothing but dishonor to the spirit of my name."

Gulacy was a film buff, and modeled many characters after film stars: Juliette on [[Marlene Dietrich]], James Larner on [[Marlon Brando]], Clive Reston (often broadly hinted at as being the son of [[James Bond]] as well as the grand nephew of [[Sherlock Holmes]]) occasionally looking like [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Sean Connery]], and a minor character Ward Sarsfield (after the real-life name of [[Sax Rohmer]]) resembling [[David Niven]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Cooke|first = Jon B.|title = A Master of Comics Art: Artist Paul Gulacy and His Early Days at Marvel|journal = Comic Book Artist|issue = 7|page = 32|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = February 2000|url = http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/07gulacy.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080215033728/http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/07gulacy.html|archivedate=February 15, 2008|deadurl= no|quote= CBA: Did you ever get any other flak?

Moench continued for a long tenure, though the title did not again receive the same level of acclaim as the Gulacy period until [[Gene Day]], who had previously been inking the book, took over penciling in #100 (1981). Despite critical success, sales lagged, and the publication schedule change from monthly to bimonthly. Day died of a heart attack after finishing issue #120, and Moench left the book after #122. The character's long-running battle with his father ended with #118 and with the main storyline resolved, the book was canceled with issue #125 as Shang-Chi retired to a passive life as a fisherman in a village. In 2010, [[Comics Bulletin]] ranked Moench's work on ''Master of Kung-Fu'' with artists Gulacy, [[Mike Zeck]], and Day sixth on its list of the "Top 10 1970s Marvels".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/columns/447/top-10-1970s-marvels/|title= Top 10 1970s Marvels|first= Jason|last= Sacks|date= September 6, 2010|publisher= [[Comics Bulletin]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6IbkCDdAA|archivedate= August 3, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= August 3, 2013}}</ref>

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the ''Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black'' one-shot (1990) and the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse'' (2002) with artist Paul Gulacy on art again. The character had two stories in the [[anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' including one by Moench that ran in the series' first eight issues in 1988, and co-starred in the ''[[Moon Knight]] Special'' (1992). In 1997 a story arc starring Shang-Chi ran in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #514-517, and was intended to lead into a mini-series for the character in 1998.<ref>{{cite news | last = Middaugh | first= Dallas | date = August 1997 | title = ''Journey into Mystery'' to Launch New Titles | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 23}}</ref>

Although spun out of licensed properties, Shang-Chi is a Marvel-owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as ''Marvel Team-Up'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''. Most of the original, licensed, characters in the supporting cast have been phased out in the more recent series and stories.

In some of his modern appearances, mention is made of his villainous father either in cryptic terms or using a variety of new names, due to Marvel no longer having the rights to Fu Manchu. In ''Secret Avengers'' #6-10, writer Ed Brubaker officially sidestepped the entire issue via a storyline where a rogue group of S.H.I.E.L.D agents resurrect a zombified version of Fu Manchu only to discover that "Fu Manch" was only an alias; that Shang-Chi's father was really an ancient Chinese sorcerer who discovered the secret to immortality.

Shang-Chi returned as a main character in the 2007 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' comic book, and both he and several characters of his supporting cast appear in that year's ''[[Pete Wisdom|Wisdom]]'' miniseries.

Shang-Chi appeared in ''Wolverine: First Class'' #9, where [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] approached him for advice in order to defeat his nemesis, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].

Still working for MI6, he goes on to collaborate with [[Pete Wisdom]] of MI-13 in facing the [[Welsh dragon]], which had turned amnesiac and become a human crime lord.

==Powers and abilities==
Although it has never been determined exactly how extensive Shang-Chi's fighting skills are, he has beaten numerous superhuman opponents.  Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty handed fighter and practitioner of kung fu alive. Much of his physical abilities seem to stem from his mastery of chi, which often allows him to surpass physical limitations of normal athletes.  He has also demonstrated the ability to dodge bullets from machine guns and sniper rifles, and is able to deflect gunshots with his bracers. Shang-Chi is also highly trained in the arts of concentration and meditation, and is an expert in various hand-weapons including swords, staves, [[kali stick]]s, nunchaku, and shuriken.

==Supporting characters==
The series, especially as written by Doug Moench was notable for its strong supporting characters. As they evolved these characters became nearly as integral to the series as Shang-Chi himself:

* '''Fu Manchu''' is portrayed in a manner mostly consistent with the Sax Rohmer novels. He is a brilliant and calculating master-villain who aspires to rule the world. As the series progresses the character deteriorates, gradually losing his nobler qualities. By the end of the series he is a pathetic figure, reduced to stealing his son's blood to preserve his immortality. He is currently known as '''Zheng Zu'''. Other notable aliases include: Mr. Han, The Father, The Devil Doctor, Chang Hu and Wang Yu-Seng.

* '''Sir Denis Nayland Smith''' is Fu Manchu's nemesis from the novels. In the comics he retains this role, his obsession with the villain often bringing out the dark side of his own character. In his better moments he becomes a sort of surrogate father to Shang-Chi. Ultimately, he is too caught up in what Shang-Chi calls 'games of deceit and death' and fails in this role. The relationship the two finally form is that of two flawed characters who feel strong friendship in spite of deep differences.

* '''Fah Lo Suee''' is the daughter of Fu Manchu and is the final character from the novels to appear in the comic. She is a villainess in her own right, though she is not interested in the misguided idealism of Fu Manchu. She is a pragmatist, seeking the best way to power. As such, she shifts alliances often. Usually she is an enemy of Shang-Chi and his friends but sometimes she is an ally. When last seen she had become a highly ranked official in [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI-6]]. She is currently known as  Zheng Bao Yu.

* '''[[Black Jack Tarr]]''' is Smith's aide-de-camp and a powerful giant of a man with a gruff manner. Though he is initially an enemy of Shang-Chi, the two become close friends over time. He exhibits the most [[bigot]]ed traits of any character and invariably addresses Shang-Chi as 'Chinaman' rather than using his name. It is one of the successes of the series that readers are drawn to feel for Tarr while the writing never turns a blind eye to his politically incorrect attitudes.

* '''[[Clive Reston]]''' is a British spy who resembles a younger and more vulnerable version of [[James Bond]]. Where Bond is a successful womanizer and seems unaffected by heavy drinking, Reston struggles with [[alcoholism]] and a romantic rivalry with Shang-Chi. The resemblance to Bond is intentional. Reston's dialogue makes it clear that he is Bond's son, and the grand-nephew of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the time of ''Wisdom'', he's the director of MI6 and has been knighted; he believes [[MI-13 (Marvel Comics)|MI-13]] to be a doomed organisation and that MI6 should handle the "weird happenings", to the extent of keeping things from the rival agency. After this attitude helped lead to a Martian invasion, he has become more cooperative, and worked with MI-13 and MI5 against [[Dracula (comics)|Dracula]].

* '''Leiko Wu''' is introduced as a [[femme fatale]] like those in the Bond films. She is a beautiful Chinese-British woman who is torn between her history with Reston and her growing attraction to Shang-Chi. Though initially sarcastic and self-possessed to the point of arrogance (Leiko is actually a Japanese name meaning "arrogant") her relationship with her new lover causes her to become more contemplative.

* '''[[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|Midnight]]''' is an [[Africa]]n child named M'Nai adopted by Fu Manchu, and raised alongside his son Shang-Chi. Fu Manchu impressed with his stoic nature trained him as one of the Si-Fan his elite assassins. Due to his badly disfigured face he always wore a mask. Fu Manchu sent him to kill Shang-Chi after his son turned his back on him, even though Shang-Chi and M'Nai considered themselves brothers. Midnight died as a result of their second battle, but was later resurrected as "Midnight Sun" by the alien [[Kree]] in cloned body and gifted with cosmic powers strong enough to challenge the [[Silver Surfer]]. After a couple of battles with the Surfer he settled down to a peaceful life in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] where he was accepted by the [[Inhumans]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/midnightsun.htm|title= Midnight Sun|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= October 10, 2004|publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20121102071923/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/midnightsun.htm|archivedate= January 31, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= January 31, 2013}}</ref>

* '''Rufus T. Hackstabber''' is a memorable character who appeared only twice in the series; he keeps referring to Shang-Chi as "Chang-Shee". The character strongly resembles [[Groucho Marx]] and his fast-paced nonsensical patter plays well off Shang-Chi's laconic seriousness. Hackstabber's name is a play on Rufus T. Firefly, Groucho's character in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]''.

* '''[[Shen Kuei]]''' or "''Cat''" is a master thief whose skill in martial arts equals Shang-Chi's. The meaning of the character's name is both similar and opposite to Shang-Chi's name. He is a sort of mirror image, a 'good bad guy' in opposition to Shang-Chi's 'bad good guy'. While they share mutual respect, the two always find themselves in opposition. He has recently appeared in [[Cable & Deadpool]] working as a mercenary for [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. He has also defeated [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who looks at him as a Rock God among mercenaries and has also referred to him as "The [[Keith Moon]] of spy trade" and "The [[Justin Timberlake]] of the Cherry Pop Club".

* '''Rufus "''Super Midnight''" Carter''' is an [[African-American]] kickboxing champion and antiques dealer who secretly works for the [[CIA]]. He is a light-hearted character who helps to draw out Shang-Chi's sense of whimsy in his several appearances. Carter's unusual nickname is accounted for by his origin. A colleague challenged Doug Moench to write a story using "Carter's Super Midnight" (the name of a brand of [[carbon paper]]) as a title.
