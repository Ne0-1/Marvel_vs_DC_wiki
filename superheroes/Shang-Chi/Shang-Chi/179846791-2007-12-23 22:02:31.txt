'''Shang-Chi''' ({{zh-cpl|c=上氣|p=shàng qì|l=rising of the spirit}}) is a [[Marvel Comics]] character, often called the "Master of [[Kung Fu]]". He was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]]. He has no special superpowers, but he exhibits extraordinary skills in the [[martial arts]] and is an master of [[Wushu]] (a general name for the various Chinese styles) both empty handed and with weapons, including the staff, [[nunchaku]] and double-edged sword.

==Publication history==
===Origin===
The character was conceived in late [[1972]] when Marvel Comics acquired the comic book rights to [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp novel villain Dr. [[Fu Manchu]] while they also held the rights to the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television program. Instead of producing a straight adaptation of either source, the decision was made to combine them.  The result was Shang-Chi, a master of Kung Fu, who was introduced as the (previously unheard of) son of Fu Manchu. Though an original character himself, many of Shang-Chi's supporting characters (most notably Fu Manchu and [[Sir Denis Nayland Smith]]) were Rohmer creations. No characters from the ''Kung Fu'' television series carried over into the comic series, though the character Lu Sung, in an early issue, bears a strong resemblance to [[Kwai Chang Caine]] with the addition of a moustache.

Shang-Chi first appeared in ''Special Marvel Edition'' #15 in December [[1973]] by Englehart and Starlin (''SME'' #1–14 were reprints of older Marvel [[superhero]] stories). Shang-Chi appeared again in issue #16, and in issue #17 (April [[1974]]) the title was changed to ''The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu''. Amidst the martial arts craze of the [[United States]] in the [[1970s]], the title would prove to be very popular and continue on until issue #125 (June [[1983]]).  In addition to the series run, Shang-Chi appeared in five Giant-Size issues, as well as ''[[Marvel Team-Up|Marvel Team-Up #84]]'' co-starring with [[Spider-Man]], and ''[[Marvel Two-in-One|Marvel Two-in-One #29]]'' where he teamed with the Thing.  Shang-Chi also appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] Special Collector's Edition'' #1 entitled "Savage Fists of Kung Fu".  He also appeared quite prominently in [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] sister [[imprint]] [[magazine]] entitled ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]''.

The series started by introducing Shang-Chi as a man raised by his father Fu Manchu to be the ultimate lackey for the would-be world conqueror.  However, his first mission, in which he killed Dr. Petrie, one of his father's old enemies, ended with Shang-Chi learning of Fu Manchu's true, evil nature. Disillusioned, Shang-Chi swore eternal opposition to his father's ambitions and fought him as an agent of British intelligence, under the orders of Nayland Smith.

The series was an instant sales success. Though Englehart and Starlin quickly left the book, the title's success grew even stronger with the coming of writer [[Doug Moench]] and artist [[Paul Gulacy]], who collaborated for the first time on #22.  Their critically acclaimed run went on (with short gaps) until #51 when Gulacy was replaced by artist [[Jim Craig]], who in turn was succeeded by [[Mike Zeck]] who became official regular penciller with #64 ([[1978]]).
{{QuoteSidebar|275px|#eeffff|right|Prologue from Master of Kung Fu:|"Call me Shang-Chi, as my father did when he raised me and molded my mind and my body in the vacuum of his Honan, China retreat.  I learned many things from my father:  That my name means 'The Rising and Advancing of a Spirit', that my body could be forged into a living weapon through the discipline of Kung Fu, and that it might be used for the murder of a man called Dr. Petrie.  

Since then I have learned that my father is Dr. Fu Manchu, the most insidiously evil man on earth…and that to honor him would bring nothing  but dishonor to the spirit of my name."
|&ndash;Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu}}

Gulacy was a film buff, and modelled many of the characters he drew on film stars: Juliette on [[Marlene Dietrich]], James Larner on [[Marlon Brando]], Clive Reston (often broadly hinted at as being the son of [[James Bond]] as well as the grand nephew of [[Sherlock Holmes]]) occasionally looking like [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Sean Connery]], and a minor character Ward Sarsfield (after the real-life name of [[Sax Rohmer]]) who looked like [[David Niven]]. Writer Doug Moench introduced other film-based characters, including two modeled after [[Groucho Marx]] and [[W. C. Fields]].

Moench continued on the series for a long tenure, though the title did not again receive the same level of acclaim as the Gulacy period until [[Gene Day]], who had previously been working on the title as its inker,  took over the penciling chores in #100 ([[1981]]). However, despite critical success, sales started to lag, and the title began to be published bi-monthly. Day died prematurely of a coronary after finishing issue #120, and Moench left the book after #122. The title was cancelled three issues later in #125, where Shang-Chi retired to a passive life as a fisherman in a village.

Shang-Chi had two more short series: the ''Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black'' [[graphic novel]] ([[1990]]) and the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] miniseries ''Master of Kung Fu: Hellfire Apocalypse'' ([[2002]]) (with artist Paul Gulacy on art again).  The character also had two stories in the [[anthology]] series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' (including one by Moench that ran in the series' first eight issues in [[1988]]), and co-starred in the ''[[Moon Knight]] Special'' ([[1992]]). 

Although spun out of licensed properties, Shang-Chi is a Marvel-owned character and has been firmly established as a part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with guest appearances in numerous other titles, such as ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.  Most of the original, licensed, characters in the supporting cast have been phased out in the more recent series and stories. 

In some of his modern appearances, mention is made of his villainous father who has apparently returned from the dead (Marvel's version of Fu Manchu was meant to have died in ''Master Of Kung Fu'' #118). However Fu Manchu is never named, only referred to as Shang's 'father' and is never shown out of shadow, as Marvel have opted not to renew the license to the character. Shang-Chi returns as character in the [[2007]] ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' comic book. 
==Fictional character biography==
Shang-Chi is the supreme master of kung fu, and the son of Fu Manchu, the Chinese mastermind who has repeatedly attempted world conquest.  Shang-Chi rebelled against his father and became an ally of Fu Manchu's archenemy, Sir Denis Nayland Smith.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Shang-Chi has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

===Heroes for Hire/World War Hulk===
As a member of the newly restored [[Heroes for Hire]], Shang Chi had put his strengh of character at the service of their teammates, his desire for inner peace often mistaken for coldness. However, Shang Chi warms with time, or at least shows more his genuine emotions, as when he avenges the death of fellow teammate Orka, forges a measure of friendship with the goofy [[Humbug (comics|Humbug]] and forges a somewhat romantic relationship with the more feisty and emotive [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Maria Vasquez|Tarantula]], peaking in a passionate kiss in the [[Savage Land]]. He later tries to put more distance between him and Maria, fearing that a strong relation could lead his inner peace to downfall, thing that happens a few time later, during the [[World War Hulk]]. Humbug, turning cards against the heroes, tries to doublecross both his friends, both the "Earth Hive" of insects, joining the [[Brood (comics)|Hive]] and offering [[Colleen Wing]] and Tarantula to a lifetime of tortures. Even so, when a dying Humbug begs his friend to [[mercy kill]] him, Shang Chi refuses, until he finds that Humbug actually had no qualms to torture Tarantula, if it meant less suffering for Colleen. Shang Chi than snaps his neck, and leaves with the catatonic Tarantula, ashamed of what he had to become, a soulless murderer.

===Supporting characters===
The series, especially as written by Doug Moench was notable for its strong supporting characters.  As they evolved these characters became nearly as integral to the series as Shang-Chi himself:  
* '''Fu Manchu''' is portrayed in a manner mostly consistent with the Sax Rohmer novels.  He is a brilliant and calculating master-villain who aspires to rule the world.  As the series progresses the character deteriorates, gradually losing his nobler qualities.  By the end of the series he is a pathetic figure, reduced to stealing his son's blood to preserve his immortality.
* '''Sir Denis Nayland Smith''' is Fu Manchu's nemesis from the novels.  In the comics he retains this role, his obsession with the villain often bringing out the dark side of his own character.  In his better moments he becomes a sort of surrogate father to Shang-Chi.  Ultimately, he is too caught up in what Shang-Chi calls 'games of deceit and death' and fails in this role.  The relationship the two finally form is that of two flawed characters who feel strong friendship in spite of deep differences.
* '''Fah Lo Suee''' is the daughter of Fu Manchu and is the final character from the novels to appear in the comic. She is a villainess in her own right, though she is not interested in the misguided idealism of Fu Manchu. She is a pragmatist, seeking the best way to power. As such, she shifts alliances often. Usually she is an enemy of Shang-Chi and his friends but sometimes she is an ally. When last seen she had become a highly ranked official in [[MI-6]].
* '''[[Black Jack Tarr]]''' is Smith's aide-de-camp and a powerful giant of a man with a gruff manner.  Though he is initially an enemy of Shang-Chi, the two become close friends over time.  He exhibits the most [[bigot]]ed traits of any character and invariably addresses Shang-Chi as 'Chinaman' rather than using his name.  It is one of the successes of the series that readers are drawn to feel for Tarr while the writing never turns a blind eye to his politically-incorrect attitudes.
* '''Clive Reston''' is a British spy who resembles a younger and more vulnerable version of [[James Bond]].  Where Bond is a successful womanizer and seems unaffected by heavy drinking, Reston struggles with [[alcoholism]] and a romantic rivalry with Shang-Chi.  The resemblance to Bond is intentional.  Reston's dialogue makes it clear that he is Bond's son, and the grand-nephew of [[Sherlock Holmes]].
* '''Leiko Wu''' is introduced as a [[femme fatale]] like those in the Bond films.  She is a beautiful  Chinese-British woman who is torn between her history with Reston and her growing attraction to Shang-Chi.  Though initially sarcastic and self-possessed to the point of arrogance (Leiko is actually a Japanese name meaning "arrogant") her relationship with her new lover causes her to become more contemplative. 
* '''Midnight'''[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/midnightsun.htm] an [[Africa]]n child named M'Nai adopted by Fu Manchu, and raised alongside his son Shang-Chi. Fu Manchu impressed with his stoic nature trained him as one of the Si-Fan his elite assassins. Due to his badly disfigured face he always wore a mask. Fu Manchu sent him to kill Shang-Chi after his son turned his back on him, even though Shang-Chi and M'Nai considered themselves brothers. Midnight died as a result of their second battle, but was later resurrected as "[[Midnight Sun (comics)|Midnight Sun]]" by the alien [[Kree]] in cloned body and gifted with cosmic powers strong enough to challenge the [[Silver Surfer]]. After a couple of battles with the Surfer he settled down to a peaceful life in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] where he was accepted by the [[Inhumans]].
* '''Rufus T. Hackstabber''' is a memorable character who appeared only twice in the series.  The character strongly resembles [[Groucho Marx]] and his fast-paced nonsensical patter plays well off Shang-Chi's laconic seriousness.  Hackstabber's name is a play on Rufus T. Firefly, Groucho's character in ''[[Duck Soup]]''.
* '''[[Shen Kuei]]''' or "''Cat''" is a master thief whose skill in martial arts equals Shang-Chi's.  The meaning of the character's name is both similar and opposite to Shang-Chi's name.  He is a sort of mirror image, a 'good bad guy' in opposition to Shang-Chi's 'bad good guy'.  While they share mutual respect, the two always find themselves in opposition.  He has recently appeared in [[Cable & Deadpool]] working as a mercenary for [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. He has also defeated [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], who looks at him as a Rock God among mercenaries and has also referred to him as "The [[Keith Moon]] of spy trade" and "The [[Justin Timberlake]] of the Cherry Pop Club".
* '''Rufus "''Super Midnight''" Carter''' is an [[African-American]] kickboxing champion and antiques dealer who secretly works for the [[CIA]].  He is a light-hearted character who helps to draw out Shang-Chi's sense of whimsy in his several appearances.  Carter's unusual nickname is accounted for by his origin.  A colleague challenged Doug Moench to write a story using "Carter's Super Midnight" (the name of a brand of [[carbon paper]]) as a title.{{-}}

==Powers and abilities==
Although it has never been determined exactly how extensive Shang-Chi's fighting skills are, he has beaten numerous superhuman opponents. Even without having any superhuman powers, he has on several occasions matched other Marvel superhumans such as [[Spider-man]] and [[the Thing]].  In one instance, he indefinitely held off a crowd of at least 30 super criminals for Captain America with help from [[Falcon]]. After the death of fellow Hero for Hire, Orka, Shang managed to single-handedly take out the [[Headmen]] including a reprogrammed Doombot, although his hands were injured badly after the battle. All of these incidents were empty handed. 

Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty handed fighter alive. Much of his physical abilities seem to stem from his mastery of chi, which often allows him to surpass physical limitations of normal athletes. In one instance, Shang was able to stand shirtless in minus 20 degree weather without feeling any physical discomfort. He has also demonstrated the ability to dodge bullets and to deflect single shots with his bracers.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] continuity, Shang-Chi has been turned. In a mid-Manhattan battle, detailed in In ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #23, he and dozens of other zombie-heroes attempt to consume the last batch of humans. The humans are defended by that universe's Magneto and the Ultimate Fantastic Four. During a successful rescue attempt, Thing sends Shang-Chi flying through the air with one punch.

===Ultimate Shang-Chi===
[[Image:Ultshangchi.jpg|160px|right|thumb|A sketch of Ultimate Shang-Chi by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Shang-Chi first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'' #15.  He is the son of an international crime lord named Fu Manchu.  Trained from birth to become a living weapon, he became the world's greatest martial artist.  A noble spirit, he eventually came to renounce his father's empire.  Seeking to get away from his father's reach, he emigrated to New York where he worked as a floor sweeper at Wu's Fish Market in Chinatown.  At some point, he met and befriended fellow martial artist [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]].

While Shang-Chi was in Chinatown, three separate gangs were threatening the locals.  He was the only one who was willing to stand up to them.  One day, he stopped a couple of the thugs from mugging a newcomer to the area, Leiko, unaware that she was an agent sent by his father to look for him.  Shortly after, he was attacked by more gang members, attracting the attention of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], who was in the area at the moment.  Before Spider-Man could lend his help, Shang-Chi had already beaten the gang members.  Seeing that Shang-Chi didn't need his help, Spider-Man left.

Leiko met with the local gangs promising them exclusive rights to the local drug trade if they could break, but not kill, Shang-Chi.  Wu Kwan, the man who ran the fish market overheard the conversation and told Shang-Chi to leave the city for his own safety.  Before he could do so, he was confronted by the heavily armed gangs.  Shang-Chi, who was outnumbered 40 to 1, began to cut a swath through his foes but was overwhelmed by their sheer numbers.  This was when Spider-Man came to lend him a hand, and together they triumphed.  Impressed by Shang-Chi's skills, Spider-Man asked him to teach him some moves.  In gratitude, Shang-Chi only had time to teach him the [[White Ape]] maneuver before departing the city.

Shang-Chi secretly returned though, feeling that the denizens of New York's Chinatown needed someone to protect them.  He and his friend Danny Rand were recently drawn into the gang war between the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] after the latter targeted him to win over the Chinatown gangs to his cause.  The conflict climaxed when Shang-Chi, Danny Rand, Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Moon Knight]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] ambushed Hammerhead's penthouse, where a battle royale ensued.  It ended with an unconscious Elektra, Hammerhead and Moon Knight.  The gang members were then arrested by the police. {{-}}

The martial arts warrior recently disguised himself as a costumed criminal in order to take down the Kingpin.  The Kingpin discovered his plan and threatened to kill the hero, but he was rescued by the Man Without Fear, Daredevil, who then recruited him as a part of his team.

===House of M===
:Shang-Chi never realizes his father's evil doings before his death at Magneto's hands<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref>. This causes him to become consumed with a desire for vengeance. In this reality, Shang-Chi is the head of the Dragons criminal organization, alongside [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], [[Mantis (comics)|Mantis]], [[Zaran]] and [[Machete (comics)|Machete]].

==Film==
A feature film, ''The Hands of Shang-Chi'', is in the planning stages, with [[Yuen Wo Ping]] directing and [[Ang Lee]] producing.<ref>[http://www.aintitcool.com/?q=node/22523 Marvel's Shang-Chi gets a MASTER for a director and a big green meanie for a producer?], [[Ain't It Cool News]]</ref>
