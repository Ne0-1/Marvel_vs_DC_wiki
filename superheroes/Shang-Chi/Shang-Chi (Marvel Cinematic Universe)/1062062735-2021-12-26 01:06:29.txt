'''Xu Shang-Chi'''{{efn|{{lang-zh|s=徐尚气|t=徐尚氣|p=Xú Shàngqì|w={{Tone superscript|Hsü2 Shang4-ch'i4}}}}}} ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ʃ|uː|_|ʃ|ɑː|ŋ|ˈ|tʃ|iː}} {{Respell|SHOO|_|shahng|CHEE}}) is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[Simu Liu]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[multimedia franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Shang-Chi|of the same name]]. In the franchise, Shang-Chi is the son of [[Ying Li (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ying Li]] and [[Wenwu]], the founder and first leader of the [[Ten Rings]] terrorist organization. Trained to be a highly skilled [[martial arts|martial artist]] and [[assassin]] by his father, alongside his sister [[Xialing]], Shang-Chi left the Ten Rings for a normal life in [[San Francisco]], only to be drawn back into the world he left behind when Wenwu seeks him out.

Shang-Chi has been noted as being the first Asian [[superhero]] to lead a large-budget film, and Liu's portrayal has been positively received. He first appeared in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).

Both being of Asian descent, Cretton and Callaham were cognizant of some of the racial stereotypes surrounding Shang-Chi in the comics, with Liu saying everyone involved was "very sensitive to not have it go into stereotypical territory".

He also sought to dispel stereotypes originating from [[Bruce Lee]] films in the 1970s that all Asian men know martial arts, making it clear in an [[Instagram]] caption that "Asian actors don't just do kung fu; but Shang-Chi does.

For an early sequence in the film where Shang-Chi fights off assassins form the Ten Rings, Cretton took heavy inspiration from the works of [[Jackie Chan]], working closely with choreographers Brad Allan and Andy Cheng, who were both trained in Chan's stunt team. Cretton stated that his favorite moment of the sequence was  "The jacket stunt...when he’s able to take his jacket off, spin it around and throw his jacket back on. It's a straight nod to Jackie Chan from the stunt team of Jackie Chan."<ref>{{Cite web|last1=September 6|first1=Peter Hartlaub|last2=September 9|first2=2021Updated|last3=2021|last4=Pm|first4=12:09|title=Behind the scenes of the 'Shang-Chi' bus chase through San Francisco — from the film's director|url=https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/behind-the-scenes-of-the-shang-chi-bus-chase-through-san-francisco-from-the-films-director|access-date=September 12, 2021|website=Datebook {{!}} San Francisco Arts & Entertainment Guide|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
=== Early life ===
Xu Shang-Chi was born to [[Xu Wenwu]], the ancient leader of the [[Ten Rings]] organization, and Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical village of [[Ta Lo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ta Lo]] in an alternate universe. Shang-Chi's childhood was blissful, with his father renouncing his criminal ways to spend time with his family and his mother entertaining him and his sister Xialing with tales of her village. When Li is murdered by the Iron Gang, old rivals of the Ten Rings, Wenwu takes up his mystical [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Ten Rings|ten rings]] and takes Shang-Chi with him to the Iron Gang's hideout, where he proceeds to brutally massacre the gang.  Wenwu reactivates the Ten Rings organization and has Shang-Chi trained in [[martial arts]] as an assassin under the brutal tutelage of [[Death Dealer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Death Dealer]]. At the age of 14, Shang-Chi is sent on a mission to kill the Iron Gang's leader and avenge his mother. Despite his success, Shang-Chi is traumatized by the ordeal and flees to [[San Francisco]] to assume a new life, adopting the name "Shaun". He leaves his younger sister Xialing behind with his father.
While attending high school, Shang-Chi befriended [[Katy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Katy]], establishing a close friendship into adulthood.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).}}

=== Confronting his past ===
{{Further|Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings}}
10 years later, in present-day,<!-- Do not add "2023" or "2024" without a non-speculatory reliable source or until it gets added to the Disney+ timeline order! --> Shang-Chi is attacked by the Ten Rings led by [[Razor Fist (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Razor Fist]]. Shang-Chi fights them off but loses his pendant given to him by his mother. Fearing that the Ten Rings will attack Xialing for her pendant, Shang-Chi tracks her down and reveals his past to Katy, who agrees to help him. They find Xialing at her [[Street fighting#Underground street fight clubs|underground fight club]] in [[Macau]], but are attacked by the Ten Rings led by Death Dealer, with Wenwu arriving to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, and Xialing. The trio are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu reveals that he believes Li is still alive and is being kept in Ta Lo, using the two pendants to create a map that can be used to enter the village. Wenwu plans to destroy the village after freeing Li and imprisons Shang-Chi and the others when they object to his plans.

The trio escape the compound with the help of [[Trevor Slattery]] and his [[hundun]] companion Morris and drive to Ta Lo to warn the village of the Ten Rings. At Ta Lo, Shang-Chi is introduced to his aunt and Li's sister, [[Ying Nan]], who explains the history of Ta Lo and reveals that Wenwu is being manipulated by the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]] into believing Li is still alive so he will use the rings to break the seal imprisoning it. Nan gifts Shang-Chi with an outfit crafted from the red [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Dragon scales|scales]] of the [[Great Protector]], the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] guardian of Ta Lo, and teaches him the fighting style of Ta Lo. Shang-Chi defends the village with his new allies when Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive to destroy the seal. Shang-Chi fights his father, but is defeated and cast into a lake. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector and uses his newfound powers to disarm Wenwu.

After the Dweller escapes its seal, Wenwu sacrifices himself to save Shang-Chi from the Dweller and bequeaths the ten rings to Shang-Chi, who uses them and the Ta Lo fighting style to destroy the Dweller. Back in San Francisco, Shang-Chi and Katy are summoned by the sorcerer [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] to accompany him to [[Kamar-Taj]], where they are introduced to [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] and [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]] via hologram. Wong, Banner, and Danvers discover that the rings are emitting a mysterious signal and Wong vows to keep looking into it. Shang-Chi then suggests they go to a bar, and he, Katy, and Wong sing karaoke together.

==Reception==
Karen Rought of ''Hypable'' praised the decision to have Shang-Chi already know who he is and what he can do from the very beginning, contrasting with many familiar [[Origin story|origin stories]] seen in other comic-book movies. Of this, Rought noted that "yes, this is an origin story, but it was more about self-acceptance than self-discovery...that was a breath of fresh air for the first film about a new character in the MCU." She described Liu's take on the character to "offers us a perfect dichotomy in his role...He's a kind-faced, goofy, normal guy who hides a secret."<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 6, 2021|title='Shang-Chi' movie review: Marvel introduces a whole new world|url=https://www.hypable.com/shang-chi-movie-review/|access-date=September 12, 2021|website=Hypable|language=en-US}}</ref> Justin Chang of [[NPR]] was drawn into the character by his complicated relationship with Wenwu, saying that "[Shang-Chi] has a complicated, vaguely Oedipal rivalry with his father, who turned him into the fighting machine he is and subjected him to all manner of cruel manipulation and abuse", demarking the character's "depths of...trauma".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Marvel's 1st Asian Superhero Gets The Full Blockbuster Treatment In 'Shang-Chi'|url=https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1032875594/shang-chi-review-marvels-1st-asian-superhero|access-date=September 12, 2021|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref> Herb Scribner of ''Deseret'' called Shang-Chi "absolutely excellent" and that "he needs to be around for Marvel films for the foreseeable future." Scribner felt that "as Shang-Chi, Liu walks the line of a young man trying to find his way and a vulnerable young boy trying to find his family" and compared the character favorably to other leading characters in the MCU including [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] and Bruce Banner.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Scribner|first=Herb|date=August 23, 2021|title='Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is your next favorite Marvel movie|url=https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/23/22634154/shang-chi-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review|access-date=September 12, 2021|website=Deseret News|language=en}}</ref>

After comments from 2017 in which Liu criticized the Chinese government resurfaced, saying that his parents told him that China was a "third world" country where people were "dying of starvation". A China release for ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' thus became unlikely; this led many Chinese fans to express disappointment that they would not be able to see the movie, citing the film's decision to remove controversial character elements related to Shang-Chi as a positive.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tartaglione|first1=Nancy|date=September 10, 2021|title='Shang-Chi' China Release Unlikely In Wake Of Unearthed Comments By Star Simu Liu; 'The Eternals' Hopes In Question|url=https://deadline.com/2021/09/shang-chi-china-release-simu-liu-marvel-1234830474/|access-date=September 12, 2021|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=September 8, 2021|title='Shang-Chi' fans in China call government decision not to release movie a "tragedy"|url=https://www.newsweek.com/shang-chi-fans-china-call-government-decision-not-release-movie-tragedy-1627012|access-date=September 12, 2021|website=Newsweek|language=en}}</ref>

Liu has said that he has "no knowledge whatsoever of any of the future Marvel plans for this character or any other character" but would like to return for an adaptation of "[[Spider-Island]]", a comic he described as being a "very famous story in which Shang-Chi and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Spider-Man]] have a little team-up moment" and that he would like for Shang-Chi to train Spider-Man in the "Way of the Spider".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mithaiwala|first=Mansoor|date=September 4, 2021|title=Simu Liu Interview: Shang-Chi|url=https://screenrant.com/simu-liu-shang-chi-interview/|access-date=September 12, 2021|website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref> In an interview on the podcast ''Phase Zero'', Liu also showed interest in starring in a future episode of ''[[What If...?
