'''Xu Shang-Chi''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ʃ|uː|_|ʃ|ɑː|ŋ|ˈ|tʃ|iː}} {{Respell|SHOO|_|shahng|CHEE}}; {{lang-zh|s=徐尚气|p=Xú Shàngqì}}) is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[Simu Liu]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[multimedia franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Shang-Chi|of the same name]]. In the franchise, Shang-Chi is the son of [[Ying Li (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ying Li]] and [[Wenwu]], the founder and first leader of the [[Ten Rings (organization)|Ten Rings]] terrorist organization. Trained to be a highly skilled [[martial arts|martial artist]] and [[assassin]] by his father, alongside his sister [[Xialing]], Shang-Chi left the Ten Rings for a normal life in [[San Francisco]], only to be drawn back into the world he left behind when Wenwu seeks him out.

Shang-Chi has been noted as being the first Asian [[superhero]] to lead a large-budget film, and Liu's portrayal has been positively received. He first appeared in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021), and will return in the film's sequel. An alternate version of the character is set to appear in the animated series ''[[Marvel Zombies (TV series)|Marvel Zombies]]'' (2024).<ref name="SDCC2022CBR">{{Cite web |last=Nolan |first=Liam |date=July 22, 2022 |title=SDCC Live: Marvel Studios Animation Panel Reveals Future of X-Men '97, What If and Marvel Zombies |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-studios-animation-x-men-what-if-zombies-sdcc/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220722212921/https://www.cbr.com/marvel-studios-animation-x-men-what-if-zombies-sdcc/ |archive-date=July 22, 2022 |access-date=July 22, 2022 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref>

== Concept and creation ==
The character was conceived in late 1972 by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]].  Marvel Comics had wished to acquire the rights to adapt the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television program, but were denied permission by [[Warner Communications]], who was also the owner of Marvel's primary rival, [[DC Comics]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=99}}</ref> Instead, Marvel acquired the comic book rights to [[Sax Rohmer]]'s pulp villain [[Fu Manchu|Dr. Fu Manchu]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 3, 2001 |title=A success written in the stars |url=http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125065341/http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/entrevista_starlin_eng01.cfm |archive-date=November 25, 2010 |publisher=[[Universo HQ]]}}</ref> Englehart and Starlin developed Shang-Chi, a master of [[kung fu]], who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Fu Manchu.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Sanderson |first1=Peter |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0756641238 |location=London, United Kingdom |page=161 |chapter=1970s |quote=Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jim Starlin]] created Marvel's ''Master of Kung Fu'' series.

Starlin left the series after #17 (replaced by Paul Gulacy) and Englehart after #19 (replaced by [[Doug Moench]]). No characters from the ''Kung Fu'' television series were officially included in the comic series, though in the #19 issue the character Lu Sun bore such a strong resemblance to [[Kwai Chang Caine]] that to avoid copyright issues, the character was given a mustache throughout the issue.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brian Cronin |title=Shang-Chi: How Marvel Edited a Comic to Hide a Kung Fu Character's Appearance |date=October 27, 2021 |url=https://www.cbr.com/shang-chi-how-marvel-edited-a-comic-to-hide-a-kung-fu-characters-appearance/ |access-date=March 7, 2022 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |publication-date=October 26, 2021 |quote=In #19, Shang-Chi runs afoul of the monstrous Man-Thing, who can burn anyone who experiences fear while touching him.

Moench later recalled to Jon B. Cooke in TwoMorrows' Comic Book Artist #7, while noting that no one had ever bothered them during their time together on the series (when they had cameos and facial likenesses of a number of major characters), "There had been an earlier problem when Paul drew David Carradine and they actually had to go over Paul's artwork and put a mustache on the David Carradine character, but for some reason, when we were doing it, it all slipped by and there was never any problem." |archive-date=March 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307213445/https://www.cbr.com/shang-chi-how-marvel-edited-a-comic-to-hide-a-kung-fu-characters-appearance/ |url-status=live }}</ref> With artist [[Paul Gulacy]], Shang-Chi's visual appearance was modeled after that of [[Bruce Lee]].<ref name="CBA7">{{Cite magazine |last=Cooke |first=Jon B. |date=February 2000 |title=A Master of Comics Art - Artist Paul Gulacy and His Early Days at Marvel |url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/07gulacy.html |url-status=live |magazine=[[Comic Book Artist]] |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |issue=7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021213030/http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/07gulacy.html |archive-date=October 21, 2007 |access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref> According to Englehart, his name was influenced by his study of the [[I-Ching]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Master of Kung Fu 15-19 - Deadly Hands of Kung Fu 1-2 |url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Master%20of%20Kung%20Fu.html |access-date=September 7, 2021 |website=www.steveenglehart.com |archive-date=September 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210907101230/http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Master%20of%20Kung%20Fu.html |url-status=live }}</ref> composed of  [[List of hexagrams of the I Ching#Hexagram 46|升 (shēng)]] meaning "ascending" and [[Qi|chi]] meaning vital energy.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Francisco |first=Eric |title=Shang-Chi: Why Marvel's most influential comic disappeared. |url=https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/shang-chi-master-of-kung-fu-history-origins |access-date=August 31, 2021 |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |language=en |archive-date=January 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128141822/https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/shang-chi-master-of-kung-fu-history-origins |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Inspirations and dispelling stereotypes ===
Both being of Asian descent, Cretton and Callaham were cognizant of some of the racial stereotypes surrounding Shang-Chi in the comics, with Liu saying everyone involved was "very sensitive to not have it go into stereotypical territory". Cretton believed the resulting script for ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' was a "really beautiful update" to the character from what began in the comics, and was an authentic story about Asian identity.<ref name="EWApril2021">{{Cite magazine |last=Coggan |first=Devan |date=April 19, 2021 |title=Simu Liu suits up in first look at Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings |url=https://ew.com/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-simu-liu-first-look/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210419131805/https://ew.com/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-simu-liu-first-look/ |archive-date=April 19, 2021 |access-date=April 19, 2021 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Callaham added that there is "no single Asian American voice", and he and Cretton contemplated how the film could speak to "the wider Asian diaspora" and would be "exciting and entertaining, but also personal to all these people".<ref name="EWCoverStoryJul2021">{{Cite magazine |last=Yu |first=Phil |date=July 6, 2021 |title=Simu Liu is hitting new heights with Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings |url=https://ew.com/movies/simu-liu-cover-shang-chi-legend-ten-rings/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210706182002/https://ew.com/movies/simu-liu-cover-shang-chi-legend-ten-rings/ |archive-date=July 6, 2021 |access-date=July 6, 2021 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>  Cretton likened Shang-Chi to Will Hunting from ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997), who is a "mixture of masculinity and vulnerability", noting both characters had secrets and superpowers they do not understand while Liu believed that Shang-Chi's struggles with identity were the core of the character, rather than his martial arts skills.<ref name="EWCoverStoryJul2021" /><ref name="LiuMensHealth">{{Cite web |last=Samuel |first=Ebenezer |date=May 19, 2021 |title=Simu Liu Wants You to See Yourself as a Superhero |url=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36343557/simu-liu-shang-chi-marvel-superhero/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519183928/https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a36343557/simu-liu-shang-chi-marvel-superhero/ |archive-date=May 19, 2021 |access-date=May 20, 2021 |website=[[Men's Health]]}}</ref>

When he was contacted to portray the role, Liu wanted the film to "allow society to see Asian men as powerful, desirable and an aspiration of possibility." Liu used experiences as a child battling stereotypes and '[[microaggression]]s as being relatable to Shang-Chi's character arc of coming to terms with his heritage. He also sought to dispel stereotypes originating from [[Bruce Lee]] films in the 1970s that all Asian men know martial arts, making it clear in an [[Instagram]] caption that "Asian actors don't just do kung fu; but Shang-Chi does. It's one of the many things that flesh out his personality, but it's easily the most challenging from a physical perspective.”<ref>{{Cite web |title=Simu Liu Manifests His Destiny In 'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings' |url=https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/09/01/simu-liu-shang-chi |access-date=September 12, 2021 |website=www.wbur.org |language=en |archive-date=January 31, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220131192814/https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/09/01/simu-liu-shang-chi |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite knowing little about the character at first, Liu was reassured early in ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings''<nowiki/>'s production that "it was very clear from the get-go that [Cretton] was committed to telling an origin story of a hero [that] was not stereotypical, not a trope, who was fully three-dimensional and had a fully modernized [2021] origin story.

For an early sequence in the film where Shang-Chi fights off assassins form the Ten Rings, Cretton took heavy inspiration from the works of [[Jackie Chan]], working closely with choreographers [[Brad Allan]] and [[Andy Cheng]], who were both trained in Chan's stunt team.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Early life ===
Xu Shang-Chi was born to [[Xu Wenwu]], the ancient leader of the [[Ten Rings (organization)|Ten Rings]] organization, and Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical village of [[Ta Lo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ta Lo]] in an alternate universe. Shang-Chi's childhood was blissful, with his father renouncing his criminal ways to spend time with his family and his mother entertaining him and his sister Xialing with tales of her village. When Li is murdered by the Iron Gang, old rivals of the Ten Rings, Wenwu takes up his mystical [[Ten Rings (object)|ten rings]] and takes Shang-Chi with him to the Iron Gang's hideout, where he proceeds to brutally massacre the gang.  Wenwu reactivates the Ten Rings organization and has Shang-Chi trained in [[martial arts]] as an assassin under the brutal tutelage of [[Death Dealer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Death Dealer]]. At the age of 14, Shang-Chi is sent on a mission to kill the Iron Gang's leader and avenge his mother. Despite his success, Shang-Chi is traumatized by the ordeal and flees to [[San Francisco]] to assume a new life, adopting the name "Shaun". He leaves his younger sister Xialing behind with his father. While attending high school, Shang-Chi befriended [[Katy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Katy]], establishing a close friendship into adulthood.

=== Confronting his past ===
{{Further|Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings}}
10 years later, in present-day,<!-- Do not add "2023" or "2024" without a non-speculatory reliable source or until it gets added to the Disney+ timeline order! --> Shang-Chi is attacked by the Ten Rings led by [[Razor Fist (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Razor Fist]]. Shang-Chi fights them off but loses his pendant given to him by his mother. Fearing that the Ten Rings will attack Xialing for her pendant, Shang-Chi tracks her down and reveals his past to Katy, who agrees to help him. They find Xialing at her [[Street fighting#Underground street fight clubs|underground fight club]] in [[Macau]], but are attacked by the Ten Rings led by Death Dealer, with Wenwu arriving to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, and Xialing after breaking up the fight. The trio are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu reveals that he believes Li is still alive and is being kept in Ta Lo, using the two pendants to create a map that can be used to enter the village. Wenwu plans to destroy the village after freeing Li and imprisons Shang-Chi and the others when they object to his plans.

The trio escape the compound with the help of [[Trevor Slattery]] and his [[hundun]] companion Morris and drive to Ta Lo to warn the village of the Ten Rings. At Ta Lo, Shang-Chi is introduced to his aunt and Li's sister [[Ying Nan]], who explains the history of Ta Lo and reveals that Wenwu is being manipulated by the [[Dweller-in-Darkness (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dweller-in-Darkness]] into believing Li is still alive so he will use the rings to break the seal imprisoning it. Nan gifts Shang-Chi with an outfit crafted from the red dragon scales of the [[Great Protector]], the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] guardian of Ta Lo, and teaches him the fighting style of Ta Lo. Shang-Chi defends the village with his new allies when Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive to destroy the seal. Shang-Chi fights his father, but is defeated and cast into a lake. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector and uses his newfound powers to disarm Wenwu.

After the Dweller escapes its seal, Wenwu sacrifices himself to save Shang-Chi from the Dweller and bequeaths the ten rings to Shang-Chi, who uses them and the Ta Lo fighting style to destroy the Dweller. Shang-Chi later makes a paper lantern and lights it in memory of his father.

Back in San Francisco, Shang-Chi and Katy are summoned by the sorcerer [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] to accompany him to [[Kamar-Taj (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kamar-Taj]], where they are introduced to [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] and [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]] via hologram. Wong, Banner, and Danvers discover that the rings are emitting a mysterious signal and Wong vows to keep looking into it. Shang-Chi then suggests they go to a bar, and he, Katy, and Wong sing karaoke together.

==Reception==
Karen Rought of ''Hypable'' praised the decision to have Shang-Chi already know who he is and what he can do from the very beginning, contrasting with many familiar [[Origin story|origin stories]] seen in other comic-book movies. Of this, Rought noted that "yes, this is an origin story, but it was more about self-acceptance than self-discovery...that was a breath of fresh air for the first film about a new character in the MCU." She described Liu's take on the character to "offers us a perfect dichotomy in his role...He's a kind-faced, goofy, normal guy who hides a secret."<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 6, 2021 |title='Shang-Chi' movie review: Marvel introduces a whole new world |url=https://www.hypable.com/shang-chi-movie-review/ |access-date=September 12, 2021 |website=Hypable |language=en-US |archive-date=June 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611094112/https://www.hypable.com/shang-chi-movie-review/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Justin Chang of [[NPR]] was drawn into the character by his complicated relationship with Wenwu, saying that "[Shang-Chi] has a complicated, vaguely Oedipal rivalry with his father, who turned him into the fighting machine he is and subjected him to all manner of cruel manipulation and abuse", demarking the character's "depths of...trauma".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Marvel's 1st Asian Superhero Gets The Full Blockbuster Treatment In 'Shang-Chi' |language=en |work=NPR.org |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1032875594/shang-chi-review-marvels-1st-asian-superhero |access-date=September 12, 2021 |archive-date=February 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220222075215/https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1032875594/shang-chi-review-marvels-1st-asian-superhero |url-status=live }}</ref> Herb Scribner of ''Deseret'' called Shang-Chi "absolutely excellent" and that "he needs to be around for Marvel films for the foreseeable future." Scribner felt that "as Shang-Chi, Liu walks the line of a young man trying to find his way and a vulnerable young boy trying to find his family" and compared the character favorably to other leading characters in the MCU including [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] and Bruce Banner.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Scribner |first=Herb |date=August 23, 2021 |title='Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is your next favorite Marvel movie |url=https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/23/22634154/shang-chi-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review |access-date=September 12, 2021 |website=Deseret News |language=en |archive-date=November 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119124638/https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/23/22634154/shang-chi-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review |url-status=live }}</ref>

After comments from a 2017 interview in which Liu referencing that his parents told him that China was a "third world" country where people were "dying of starvation",a Chinese release for ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' thus became unlikely. This led many Chinese fans to express disappointment that they would not be able to see the movie, citing the film's decision to remove controversial character elements related to Shang-Chi as a positive.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tartaglione |first=Nancy |date=September 10, 2021 |title='Shang-Chi' China Release Unlikely In Wake Of Unearthed Comments By Star Simu Liu; 'The Eternals' Hopes In Question |url=https://deadline.com/2021/09/shang-chi-china-release-simu-liu-marvel-1234830474/ |access-date=September 12, 2021 |website=Deadline |language=en-US |archive-date=October 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211019020824/https://deadline.com/2021/09/shang-chi-china-release-simu-liu-marvel-1234830474/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=September 8, 2021 |title='Shang-Chi' fans in China call government decision not to release movie a "tragedy" |url=https://www.newsweek.com/shang-chi-fans-china-call-government-decision-not-release-movie-tragedy-1627012 |access-date=September 12, 2021 |website=Newsweek |language=en |archive-date=January 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220106111540/https://www.newsweek.com/shang-chi-fans-china-call-government-decision-not-release-movie-tragedy-1627012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
