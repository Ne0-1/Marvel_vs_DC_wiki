'''Salem's Seven''' was a team of magical [[supervillains]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]].  They were foes of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].  All seven were the children of [[Nicholas Scratch]] and the grandchildren of [[Agatha Harkness]].  They were humans with magic powers who could transform into fantastic creatures with super-powers.

==Publication history==
The team first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1 #186 (September 1977), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[George Pérez]].

The team subsequently appears in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #14 (1979), ''Fantastic Four'' #223 (October 1980), ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #3 (December 1985), ''The Avengers 2000 Annual'', ''Marvel Knights: 4'' #25-27 (February–April 2006), and ''Four'' #30 (August 2006).

The team has an entry named "Salem's Seven" in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #19.

==Fictional team history==
Salem's Seven originated in the town of New Salem, Colorado, a hidden town populated entirely by magicians who mostly lived in fear and loathing of normal humanity.  All of Salem's Seven were fathered among different women by Nicholas Scratch.  Scratch's own mother Agatha Harkness was the most powerful of the town's inhabitants, but she chose to leave the village and live among humanity. In time she became governess for [[Franklin Richards]], son of [[Invisible Woman|Sue]] and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Scratch had Salem's Seven abduct Agatha for purportedly betraying the New Salem community. They also brought back Franklin with them to give to Scratch as a new host-body, which forced the Fantastic Four to pursue.  Although initially overcome and imprisoned, the Four defeated their captors, banished Scratch from this dimension, and saved Harkness.  When Salem's Seven much later tried to avenge themselves on Harkness, she removed their ability to change forms.

Over the years, Salem's Seven managed to reverse the spells locking them out of their enhanced forms, greatly weakening Harkness in the process. They took control of New Salem, and with [[Vertigo (Salem's Seven)|Vertigo]] as their leader, they turned the whole community against Harkness and burned her at the stake.  The [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|the Vision]] were then drawn to New Salem, where they were captured by the Seven.  Gazelle dissented with the group's plans of sacrifice, and was thrown in with the prisoners. The Vision escaped and battled Vertigo, who drew into herself the powers of the other 665 residents of New Salem. When the Vision defeated her, Vertigo lost control of the power. The Scarlet Witch managed to channel some of it off, but in the ensuing explosion all of New Salem was apparently wiped out, including the Seven.

The next Halloween, Wanda attempted to commune with Agatha Harkness's spirit, but was drawn through into the land of the dead, where she was confronted with spirits of the Seven (except Gazelle) who had aligned themselves with a being that called itself [[Samhain]]. Wanda defeated Samhain and bound him within the spirits of the six of the Seven.

Via samples of their DNA, Brutacus, Hydron, Reptilla, Thornn, and Vakume were later re-animated as some of [[Arnim Zola]]'s proto-husks.  These were all introduced and then promptly slain for humorous effect by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] in ''Deadpool'' #0, a free [[sales promotion|giveaway]] from [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]].

Salem's Seven was recently resurrected when the Scarlet Witch's [[mental breakdown]] and manipulation of magic restored them to life. Their father, Nicholas Scratch, manipulated them into releasing [[Shuma-Gorath]] but then aided the FF, [[Diablo (comics)|Diablo]], and [[Doctor Strange]] in defeating Scratch and Shuma-Gorath. The seven are now living with Strange and are friends of the FF.

==Team members==
* '''Brutacus''' - Son of Scratch, transforms into a leonine humanoid with red horns which has strength and durability sufficient to match [[Thing (comics)|the Thing]] or [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|the Vision]]
* '''Gazelle''' - Daughter of Scratch, transforms into a cloven-hoofed person with super-speed and agility.
* '''Hydron''' - Son of Scratch, transforms into [[biped]]al [[merman]] who can fire controllable streams of water from the stump-end of his left arm.
* '''Reptilla''' - Daughter of Scratch, transforms into serpentine form with a single long tail instead of legs, and two poisonous serpents instead of her arms.  She has the ability to constrict and to also bite with her hand-snakes.
* '''Thornn''' - Son of Scratch, transforms into a yellow demonic humanoid with large red thorns jutting from the arms and legs.  He has the ability to throw explosive or stunning thorns.
* '''Vakume''' - Son of Scratch, transforms into a featureless purple humanoid.  He has the ability to become intangible and control air, creating winds and vacuums.
* '''Vertigo''' - African-American and eldest daughter of Scratch with no special transformation. She is not the same character as [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)#Vertigo II|Vertigo]] of the [[Savage Land Mutates]], but possesses the same ability to attack a person's sense of balance.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
Appearing in [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] operating out of Salem, Oregon, the Seven (as they are called) are a new Super Hero team. Although they are saving many people, they are just as quick to fight the Fantastic Four to get the chance to do so first. Members Include:

* '''Alpha Dog''' - Leader of the Seven. He is able to alter density of objects allowing for the appearance of super-strength and invulnerability.
* '''Ghostware''' - Member of the Seven with the ability to phase others and self through solid matter.
* '''Neuropath''' - Member of the Seven with emotional induction which allows for control of others' emotions.
* '''Penultimate''' - Member of the Seven with cybernetically-enhanced body and high-tech weaponry.
* '''Primal Screamer''' - Member of the Seven with powerful vocal blasts.
* '''Filament''' - Member of the Seven who creates hyper-dimensional threads which cut through all matter
* '''Synchron''' - Member of the Seven who can alters probability in such a way that he can be in several positions at once, attacking from many directions.

In issue #56, it is revealed that the group are one being, a creature known as the Dragon-of-Seven which can separate into multiple forms. As a single entity, the Dragon takes the form of [[Agatha Harkness]]. The Dragon posed as Harkness to get the Fantastic Four to doubt how they work as a team, and as the Seven so that they would doubt even further, as part of a plot to kidnap the Human Torch, force him to explode, and give birth to more just like it. The Dragon was killed when the Invisible Woman found a way to reverse the heat waves, so that the Dragon, in the form of the Seven, would explode instead.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Salem's Seven appeared in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' episode ''The Sorceress Apprentice''. Alongside [[Nicholas Scratch]], they kidnapped Agatha Harkness. Scarlet Witch and Vision fought them while the other Avengers were busy fighting [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]].
