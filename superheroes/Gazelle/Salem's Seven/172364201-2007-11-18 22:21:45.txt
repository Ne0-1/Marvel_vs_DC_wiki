'''Salem's Seven''' was a team of magical [[supervillains]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]].  They were foes of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].  All seven were the children of [[Nicholas Scratch]] and the grandchildren of [[Agatha Harkness]].  They were humans with magic powers who could transform into fantastic creatures with super-powers.

==Fictional team history==
Salem's Seven originated in the town of New Salem, Colorado, a hidden town populated entirely by magicians who mostly lived in fear and loathing of normal humanity.  All of Salem's Seven were fathered among different women by [[Nicholas Scratch]].  Scratch's own mother Agatha Harkness was the most powerful of the town's inhabitants, but she chose to leave the village and live among humanity. In time she became governess for [[Franklin Richards]], son of [[Invisible Woman|Sue]] and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Scratch had Salem's Seven abduct Agatha for purportedly betraying the New Salem community. They also brought back Franklin with them to give to Scratch as a new host-body, which forced the Fantastic Four to pursue.  Although initially overcome and imprisoned, the Four defeated their captors, banished Scratch from this dimension, and saved Harkness.  When Salem's Seven much later tried to revenge themselves on Harkness, she removed their ability to change forms.

Over the years, Salem's Seven managed to reverse the spells locking them out of their enhanced forms, greatly weakening Harkness in the process. They took control of New Salem, and with Vertigo as their leader, they turned the whole community against Harkness and burned her at the stake.  The [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|the Vision]] were then drawn to New Salem, where they were captured by the Seven.  Gazelle dissented with the group's plans of sacrifice, and was thrown in with the prisoners. The Vision escaped and battled Vertigo, who drew into herself the powers of the other 665 residents of New Salem. When the Vision defeated her, Vertigo lost control of the power. The Scarlet Witch managed to channel some of it off, but in the ensuing explosion all of New Salem was apparently wiped out, including the Seven.

The next Halloween, Wanda attempted to commune with Agatha Harkness's spirit, but was drawn through into the land of the dead, where she was confronted with spirits of the Seven (except Gazelle) who had aligned themselves with a being that called itself [[Samhain]]. Wanda defeated Samhain and bound him within the spirits of the six of the Seven.

Via samples of their DNA, Brutacus, Hydron, Reptilla, Thornn, and Vakume were later re-animated as some of [[Arnim Zola]]'s proto-husks.  These were all introduced and then promptly slain for humorous effect by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] in Deadpool #0, a free [[sales promotion|giveaway]] from [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard magazine]].

Salem's Seven was recently resurrected when the The [[Scarlet Witch|Scarlet Witch's]] mental break down and manipulation of magic restored them to life. Their father, Nicholas Scratch, manipulated them into releasing [[Shuma-Gorath]] but then aided the FF, [[Diablo (comics)|Diablo]], and [[Doctor Strange]] in defeating Scratch and Shuma-Gorath. The seven are now living with Strange and are friends of the FF.
