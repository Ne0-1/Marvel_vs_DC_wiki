'''Salem's Seven''' is a fictional team of magical beings and former [[supervillains]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They were initially foes of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], but in more recent years, they have become allies to both. All seven are the children of [[Nicholas Scratch]] and the grandchildren of [[Agatha Harkness]]. They are humans with magic powers who can transform into fantastic creatures with super-powers.

==Publication history==
The team first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1 #186 (September 1977), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[George Pérez]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=305}}</ref>

==Fictional team history==
Salem's Seven originated in New Salem, [[Colorado]], a hidden town in an unsettled part of the [[Rocky Mountains]] populated entirely by magic users who mostly lived in fear and loathing of normal humanity due to the persecution that was imposed on them during the [[Salem witch trials]]. All of Salem's Seven were fathered among different women by [[Nicholas Scratch]]. Scratch's own mother Agatha Harkness was the most powerful of the town's inhabitants, but she chose to leave the village and live among humanity. In time, she became the governess for [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] (son of [[Invisible Woman]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]). Scratch had Salem's Seven abduct Agatha for purportedly betraying the New Salem community. They also brought back Franklin with them to give to Scratch as a new host-body, which forced the Fantastic Four to pursue. Although initially overcome and imprisoned, the Four defeated their captors, banished Scratch from this dimension, and saved Harkness. When Salem's Seven much later tried to avenge themselves on Harkness, she removed their ability to change forms.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #186. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Over the years, Salem's Seven managed to reverse the spells locking them out of their enhanced forms, greatly weakening Harkness in the process. They took control of New Salem, and with Vertigo as their leader, they turned the whole community against Harkness and burned her at the stake. The [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|the Vision]] were then drawn to New Salem, where they were captured by the Seven. Gazelle dissented with the group's plans of sacrifice, and was thrown in with the prisoners. The Vision escaped and battled Vertigo, who drew into herself the powers of the other 665 residents of New Salem. When the Vision defeated her, Vertigo lost control of the power. The Scarlet Witch managed to channel some of it off, but in the ensuing explosion all of New Salem was apparently wiped out, including the Seven.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #3, Marvel Comics.</ref>

The next Halloween, Wanda attempted to commune with Agatha Harkness's spirit, but was drawn through into the land of the dead, where she was confronted with spirits of the Seven (except Gazelle) who had aligned themselves with a being that called itself [[Samhain]]. Wanda defeated Samhain and bound him within the spirits of the six of the Seven.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Via samples of their DNA, Brutacus, Hydron, Reptilla, Thornn, and Vakume were later re-animated as some of [[Arnim Zola]]'s proto-husks. These were all introduced and then promptly slain for humorous effect by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

All members of the Salem's Seven were resurrected when the Scarlet Witch's [[mental breakdown]] and manipulation of magic restored them to life.{{issue|date=May 2014}} Their father Nicholas Scratch manipulated them into releasing [[Shuma-Gorath]], but then aided the Fantastic Four, [[Diablo (comics)|Diablo]], and [[Doctor Strange]] in defeating Scratch and Shuma-Gorath.{{issue|date=May 2014}} The seven were subsequently living with Doctor Strange and are friends of the Fantastic Four.{{issue|date=May 2014}}

In the pages of the 2014 ''[[New Warriors]]'' series, the Salem's Seven have been seen living again in New Salem, which has become a haven for all people "born of magic" with Salem's Seven acting as the town's resident protectors.<ref>''New Warriors'' Vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Through the advice of a [[Quiet Man (comics)|mysterious benefactor]], [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] enlisted Gazelle, Reptilla, and Vertigo of the Salem's Seven to join his [[Frightful Four]]. They attacked Mister Fantastic in Chicago until Scarlet Witch arrived to help Mister Fantastic.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 5 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]" storyline, Gazelle was among the animal-themed superhumans captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] for [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s Great Hunt sponsored by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s company Arcade Industries. In the ensuing chaos when the hunt begins, Gazelle is stabbed by a Hunter-Bot controlled by one of the participants.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Appearing in [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] operating out of Salem, Oregon, the Seven (as they are called) are a new Super Hero team. Although they are saving many people, they are just as quick to fight the Fantastic Four to get the chance to do so first. Members Include:

* '''Alpha Dog''' - Leader of the Seven. He is able to alter density of objects allowing for the appearance of super-strength and invulnerability.
* '''Ghostware''' - Member of the Seven with the ability to phase others and self through solid matter.
* '''Neuropath''' - Member of the Seven with emotional induction which allows for control of others' emotions.

In issue #56, it is revealed that the group are one being, a creature known as the Dragon-of-Seven which can separate into multiple forms. As a single entity, the Dragon takes the form of [[Agatha Harkness]]. The Dragon posed as Harkness to get the Fantastic Four to doubt how they work as a team, and as the Seven so that they would doubt even further, as part of a plot to kidnap the Human Torch, force him to explode, and give birth to more just like it. The Dragon was killed when the Invisible Woman found a way to reverse the heat waves, so that the Dragon, in the form of the Seven, would explode instead.

==In other media==
The Salem's Seven appeared in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' episode "The Sorceress Apprentice". Alongside [[Nicholas Scratch]], they kidnapped Agatha Harkness. Scarlet Witch and Vision fought them while the other Avengers were busy fighting [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]].
