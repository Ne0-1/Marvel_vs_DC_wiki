'''Skullbuster ''' is the name of three [[comic book]] [[super villain]]s all of which exist in [[Marvel Comics]]' main [[Shared universe|shared]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The original Skullbuster first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #229 (May 1988) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].

==Original Skullbuster==
The cyborg Skullbuster was a member of the original [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], a gang of cyborgs living in a ghost town in Australia, who perpetrated robberies across the globe. Skullbuster, as well as Pretty Boy and Bonebreaker, avoided being sent through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] along with the other Reavers after being defeated by the [[X-Men]].<ref name="Uncanny229">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Penciller = [[Marc Silvestri]] | Inker = [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]] | Story = Down Under  | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 229 | Date = May 1988 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> Under the leadership of [[Donald Pierce]], the remaining Reavers allied themselves with [[Lady Deathstrike]] and her minions and began training to defeat the X-Men.

==Cylla Markham Skullbuster==
Formerly a pilot, Cylla agreed to help [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Forge in finding their missing teammates, but the plane was shot down by [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]].

She agreed to become a [[cyborg]], joining Pierce's [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]].<ref name="Uncanny261"/>  Though she was replacing the original Skullbuster, Cylla mainly went by her real name.  Her first mission brought her into contact with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and she was defeated through the combined efforts of [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]].  After the supposed deaths of the other Reavers, Cylla and [[Lady Deathstrike]] fled.<ref name="Uncanny281">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Jim Lee]], [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], and [[While Portacio]] | Penciller = [[While Portacio]] | Inker = [[Art Thibert]] | Story = Fresh Upstart| Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 281 | Date = October 1991| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>  Cylla later resurfaced, allying herself with [[Bloodscream]] in an attempt to murder Wolverine.
