:''For the [[Brooklyn, NY]] [[Hip hop music|rapper]], see [[X-Clan]]''.

'''Professor Charles Francis Xavier''', also known as '''Professor X''', is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] and founder of the [[X-Men]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. Created by co-writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963#September|September 1963]]).

Throughout most of his [[comic book]] history, Xavier is [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], although his body houses one of the world's most powerful [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] minds. A high-level [[telepath]], Xavier can read, control and influence human minds. A [[science|scientific]] [[genius]], he is also a leading authority on [[genetics]], [[mutation]] and [[psionics|psionic powers]].

In the ''X-Men'' Comics, Xavier founds Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (now called the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]), which he designed to teach mutants to explore and control their powers. His mission is to promote the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights, to mediate the co-existence of mutants and humans, and to protect society from dangerous mutants, including his friend [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Xavier's students consider him a visionary and often refer to their mission as being dedicated to "Xavier's dream". However, he also has a manipulative streak which results in several significant falling-outs with allies and students.

In the comics' history, the X-Men rarely operate without Xavier. He also appears in both X-Men animated series and in many [[video game]]s, although usually as a [[non-playable character]] due to his physical limitations. [[Patrick Stewart]] plays him in the [[2000s]] [[X-Men (film)|film series]], as well as providing his voice in some of the X-Men videogames (including some not connected to the movie series).

==Character biography==
Professor Xavier is a mutant and is the one of world's most powerful [[telepath]]s. As a young man, he was rendered a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] in an accident caused by an alien called [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]]. In addition to his mutant gifts, Xavier possesses a world-class scientific intellect and is a graduate of [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] Universities.   

===Early life===
Charles Xavier was born to the wealthy Brian Xavier, a well-respected [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] scientist, and Sharon Xavier. After Brian dies in an accident, his science partner Kurt Marko comforts and marries the grieving Sharon. When Xavier's telepathic mutant powers emerge, he discovers Kurt cares only about Sharon's money.
[[Image:Profxy.PNG|A young Charles Xavier. Art by Jack Kirby.|thumb|left]]

After the wedding, Kurt moves in with the Xaviers, bringing with him his son [[Juggernaut (comics)|Cain]]. Kurt quickly grows neglectful of Sharon, driving her to alcoholism, and abuses Charles and Cain. Cain takes out his frustrations and insecurities on his step-brother. Charles once uses his telepathic powers to read Cain's mind and explore the extent of his psychological damage, which only leads to Cain becoming more aggressive toward him. Sharon dies soon after, and a fight erupts between Cain and Charles that causes some of Kurt's lab equipment to explode. Mortally wounded, Kurt drags the two children out before dying.

With help from his powers and his natural genius, Xavier becomes an excellent student and athlete, though he gives up the latter, believing his powers give him an unfair advantage. At [[graduate school]], he meets a [[Scotland|Scottish]] girl named [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Kinross]], a fellow genetics student with whom he falls in love. The two agree to get married, but soon, Xavier is drafted into the [[Korean War]].{{Citation needed}} During the war, he receives a letter from Moira telling him that she is breaking up with him. He later discovers that Moira married her old boyfriend Joseph MacTaggert, who abuses her.

After the war, Xavier travels around the world. In [[Cairo]], he meets the [[Shadow King]], a powerful mutant who is posing as an Arabian crime lord. Xavier defeats the Shadow King, barely escaping with his life. This encounter leads to Xavier's decision to devote his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent mutants from human oppression.

[[Image:Xavmags.png|170px|thumb|Xavier and Magneto part ways due to the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]] 
Xavier visits his friend Daniel Shomron, who runs a clinic for traumatized [[Holocaust]] victims in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]. There, he meets the man who becomes [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], a Holocaust survivor who works as a volunteer in the clinic, and [[Gabrielle Haller]], a woman driven into a catatonic coma by the trauma she experienced. Xavier uses his mental powers to break her out of her catatonia and the two fall in love. Xavier and Magneto become good friends, although neither immediately reveals to the other that he is a mutant. The two hold lengthy debates hypothesizing what will happen if humanity is faced with a new super-powered race of humans. While Xavier is optimistic, Magneto's experiences in the Holocaust lead him to believe that humanity will ultimately oppress the new race of humans as they have done with other minorities. The two friends reveal their powers to each other when they fight Nazi [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] and his [[HYDRA]] agents, who kidnaps Gabrielle because she knows the location of their secret cache of gold. Magneto attempts to kill Strucker but Xavier stops him. Realizing that his and Xavier's views on mutant-human relations are incompatible, Magneto leaves with the gold. Charles stays in Israel for some time, but he and Gabrielle separate on good terms, neither knowing that she is pregnant with his son, who grows up to become the mutant, [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]].

Xavier encounters the alien [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], foiling his plans for an invasion. The alien retaliates by dropping a boulder on Xavier's legs, crippling him. After Lucifer leaves, a young woman named [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] hears Xavier's telepathic cries for help and rescues him, bringing him to safety, beginning a long alliance between the two.

===The X-Men===
[[Image:Xavxmen.PNG|220px|Xavier with the original X-Men team; Beast, Iceman, Cyclops, Angel, and Marvel Girl. Art by Jack Kirby.|thumb]]
In the ''X-Men'' comic book series, Xavier founds Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, which provides a safe haven for mutants and teaches them to master their abilities. In addition, he seeks to foster mutant-human relations by providing his superhero team, the X-Men, as an example of mutants acting in good faith. Among the obstacles Xavier faces is his old friend, Magneto, who has grown into an advocate of mutant superiority since their last encounter and who believes the only solution to mutant persecution is the domination of humanity. Xavier's first five students are [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Angel (comics)|Angel]], who become the original X-Men.

Throughout most of his time with the team, Xavier uses his telepathic powers to keep in constant contact with his students and provides instructions and advice when needed. In addition, he uses a special machine called [[Cerebro]], which enhances his ability to detect mutants and to allow the team to find new students in need of the school. At one point, Xavier seemingly dies during the X-Men's battle with the sub-human Grotesk, but it is later revealed that Xavier arranged for a reformed former villain named [[Changeling (Marvel Comics)|Changeling]] to impersonate him while he went into hiding to plan a defense against an invasion by the extraterrestrial [[Z'Nox]], imparting a portion of his telepathic abilities to the Changeling to complete the disguise.

When the X-Men are captured by the [[sentient]] island [[Krakoa]], Xavier assembles a new team to rescue them. After the mission, the older team of X-Men, except for Cyclops, leave the school, believing they no longer belong there, and Xavier mentors the new X-Men. He meets and falls in love with the alien Princess [[Lilandra]] from the [[Shi'ar]] Empire and takes a sabbatical on her world for a time.
[[Image:Xavierwalk.png|Xavier walks again. Art by [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]].|200px|thumb]]

Xavier returns and shortly thereafter battles his pupil, Jean Grey, after she becomes '''Dark Phoenix''' and destroys a populated planet in the Shi'ar Empire. Xavier would have lost against the greater power of the [[Dark Phoenix]], but thanks to the help Jean Grey gives him (fighting her Phoenix persona), Xavier emerges victorious; she later commits suicide in order to prevent herself from endangering more innocent lives. (''See [[Dark Phoenix Saga]]''.)

During a storyline in which the X-Men fought members of the extraterrestrial race known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], Xavier was captured by them, and implanted with a Brood egg, which placed Xavier under the Brood’s control.  During this time, Xavier assembled a team of younger mutants called [[The New Mutants]], secretly intended to be prime hosts for reproduction of the aliens. The X-Men discover this and return to free Xavier, but they are too late to prevent him from being transformed into a Brood Queen. The X-Men and [[Starjammers]] subdue him in this monstrous form, but the only way to restore him is to clone a new body using tissue samples he donated to the Starjammers. This new body possessed functional legs, though the [[psychosomatic]] pain Xavier experienced after living so long as a paraplegic took some time to subside. Subsequently, he even joins the X-Men in the field, but later decides not to continue this practice after realizing that his place is at the school.

After taking a teaching position at another school, Xavier is severely injured and left for dead as the victim of a [[hate crime]]. [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and her [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], a group of underground-dwelling mutants, get him to safety. One of the Morlocks partially restores Xavier's health, but Callisto warns Xavier that he isn't fully healed and that he must spend more time recuperating and restrain himself from exerting his full strength or powers, or his health might fail again. Xavier hides his injuries from the others and resumes his life.

A reformed Magneto is arrested and put on trial. Xavier attends the trial to defend his friend. Andrea and Andreas Strucker, the children of presumed dead Baron Von Strucker, crash the courtroom to attack Magneto and Xavier. Xavier is seriously injured. Dying, he asks a shocked Magneto to look after the X-Men for him.  Lilandra, who has a psychic bond with Xavier, feels that he is in great danger and heads to Earth. There, she takes Xavier with her and the [[Shi'ar]] so their advanced technology can heal him. Xavier leaves Magneto in charge of the school, but some of the X-Men are unwilling to forgive their former enemy, and the original five X-Men form a team called [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. Magneto works with the X-Men, and after they are believed dead in the 1987 storyline “[[The Fall of the Mutants]]”, mentors the New Mutants. During the 1989 “[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]” storyline, in which the school is destroyed, Magneto parts company with the New Mutants, who feel that he has returned to his terrorist path. A healthy Xavier returns from the Shi'ar Empire and resumes his responsibilities. In a battle with his old foe, the [[Shadow King]], in the "[[Muir Island Saga]]", Xavier’s back is broken, returning him to his former paraplegic state.

In the mid-1990s ''X-Men'' titles, Professor X is for a time the unknowing host of the evil psionic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], the result of a previous battle with Magneto. In that battle, Magneto uses his powers to rip out the [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] bonded to [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton, and a furious Xavier wipes Magneto's mind, leaving him in a coma. From the psychic trauma of Xavier's using his powers so violently and the mixing of Magneto's and Xavier's repressed anger, Onslaught is born. Onslaught wreaks havoc, destroying much of [[Manhattan]], until many of Marvel's superheroes&mdash;including the Avengers, the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]&mdash;destroy him.  Xavier is left without his telepathy and, overcome with guilt, leaves the X-Men and is incarcerated for his actions. He later returns to the X-Men after a clash with the sentient Cerebro and a team of [[Cerebro's X-Men|imposter X-Men]].
[[Image:Nx121.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Cassandra Nova. Cover art for ''New X-Men'' #121, by Frank Quitely.]]

In writer [[Grant Morrison]]’s 2001&ndash;2004 run on ''New X-Men'', Xavier's [[evil twin]] [[Cassandra Nova]], whom Xavier attempted to kill while they were both in their mother's womb, orders a group of rogue sentinels to destroy the independent mutant nation of [[Genosha]]. Magneto, who is Genosha's leader, appears to die along with the vast majority of the nation's inhabitants. Nova then takes over Xavier's body. Posing as Xavier, she reveals his mutation to the world, something he needed to do but did not want to sully his reputation over,<ref> {{cite web| title = Marvel - Professor X History| publisher = Marvel Store| url = http://www.marvelstore.co.uk/professor_x/history/|accessdate = 2006-11-05}}</ref> before going into space and crippling the Shi'ar Empire. The X-Men restore Xavier, but Lilandra, believing that too much disaster has come from the Shi'ar's involvement with the X-Men, annuls her marriage to Xavier. During this period, a mutant named [[Xorn]] joins the X-Men. Xorn uses his healing power to restore Xavier's use of his legs.

Now outed as a mutant, Xavier makes speeches to the public about mutant tolerance. He also founds the X-Corporation, or X-Corp (not to be confused with the [[X-Corps]]), with offices all over the world. The purpose of the X-Corp is to watch over mutant rights and help mutants in need. As a result of being outed, the school no longer hides the fact that it is a school for mutants and it opens its doors for more mutant (and even human) students to come in. A student named Quentin Quire and members of his gang start a riot at the Xavier Institute during an open house at the school. As a result, Quire and two other students are killed. Uncertain about his dream's validity, Xavier announces that he will step down as headmaster and be succeeded by Jean Grey. Xorn cripples Xavier and destroys New York. The X-Men kill Xorn, but not before he kills Jean by giving her an electromagnetic stroke.

=== Retirement ===
With Jean dead, Xavier leaves the school to [[Scott Summers|Cyclops]] and [[Emma Frost]]. Xavier travels to Genosha, where he meets with the real Magneto. The two resolve their differences and attempt to restore their friendship while they work together to rebuild and restore order to the destroyed island nation. At the mansion, the [[Danger Room]], the X-Men’s [[simulated reality]] training chamber, gains [[sentience]], christens itself "Danger", assumes a humanoid form, and attacks the X-Men before leaving to kill Xavier. With Magneto's help, Xavier holds off Danger until the X-Men arrive. Danger flees, but not before revealing to [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] that Xavier has known it is sentient ever since he upgraded it. Colossus is especially offended by this because he had been held captive and experimented upon. Ashamed, Xavier tries to explain to them that by the time he realized what was happening, he could see no other course. The disgusted X-Men leave.

Magneto's daughter the [[Scarlet Witch]] suffers a mental breakdown and [[Avengers Disassembled|causes the death of several Avengers]]. Magneto brings her to Xavier and asks him to use his mental powers to help her.  Although aided by [[Dr. Strange]] and the appearance of [[Cassandra Nova]], Xavier is unsuccessful. In the ''[[House of M]]'' [[limited series]], Xavier orders a meeting of the X-Men and Avengers to decide Wanda's fate. Her brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], believing the heroes plan to kill her, speeds off to Genosha and convinces Wanda that she could right the wrongs she inflicted by using her powers to alter reality. Wanda uses her powers to make the world a place where mutants are the majority, humans the minority, and Magneto their ruler. In this reality, Xavier is believed to have died years before while helping to free Genosha.

After mutant [[Layla Miller]] restores the memories of some of the X-Men and Avengers, they head to Genosha where they discover that Magneto has erected a memorial garden for Xavier commemorating his death. They are horrified until [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] fades into the grave and discovers there is no body inside. After a battle, Scarlet Witch again uses her powers to restore reality and, as a slight against her father, causes 91.4 percent of mutants to [[Decimation (comics)|lose their powers]], leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction. With reality restored, Xavier is still missing and the X-Men are unable to detect him with Cerebro. 

In the limited series ''[[Deadly Genesis]]'', it is revealed that prior to sending the new team of X-Men to rescue the others on Krakoa, he had sent another team comprised of Moira's students; one of whom was Cyclops' long-lost brother [[Vulcan (comics)|Vulcan]]. After the team freed Cyclops and Vulcan revealed their connection, the team was killed. Cyclops escaped, but when he made it back to Xavier, Xavier wiped the traumatizing knowledge that his newfound brother had died saving him from Cyclops' brain. He then assembled another new team of X-Men to rescue the others on Krakoa, and no one else knew anything about Moira's students. In the present, the energy-mass comprised of all the mutants' powers revives Vulcan, and in a rage he attacked the X-Men, causing Xavier to come out of hiding; his legs had been restored to him after the House of M, though he was no longer a mutant. Vulcan got Xavier to tell the X-Men what he had done. After Vulcan was defeated and flew off into space, Cyclops tells Xavier that he is no longer wanted at the [[X-Mansion]] for what he did, though some of the other students are more forgiving.

{{spoiler}}
In spite of Cyclops' feelings, Xavier nevertheless forms a new team in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #475 to confront [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] before he can enact his vengeance against the [[Shi'ar]] empire.  While en route to the Shi'ar homeworld, he is abducted by agents of the Shi'ar Vice Chancellor K'Tor.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Cerebropicture.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cerebro, as seen in the ''X-Men'' films.]]
Charles Xavier is a telepath of the highest order, capable of all of the standard telepathic abilities. He is able to read thoughts, communicate with others psionically on a global (and sometimes galactic) level. Professor Xavier can erase, create, and manipulate thoughts and memories, control the actions of others, mentally induce pain, paralysis, unconsciousness, and even death in other people. He can completely shut down the mind and body of others. He can learn foreign languages by reading the language centers of the brain of someone who speaks that language, then "teach" it to someone else. He can project his astral form and enter the astral plane, control the astral plane, and even control and destroy the astral forms of others. In the ''[[X-Men:Deadly Genesis]]'' [[limited series]], Xavier trains a new group of mutants mentally, and they experience months of training together, although only hours pass in the real world.

He is left depowered after the events of the 2005 ''[[House of M]]'' and ''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]'' storylines, in which the [[Scarlet Witch]] strips most of the world's mutants of their powers.  At the same time, she restores his ability to walk.

Charles is a genius by whatever criteria one would care to apply.<ref>{{cite book | author = Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen | year = 2004 | month = February | title = Science of the X-Men | publisher = I Books/Marvel | id = ISBN 0-7434-8725-7}}</ref> He is a world-renowned geneticist and an expert on mutation, and possesses considerable knowledge of the [[life science]]s and psionics. Xavier is the [[inventor]] of the [[Cerebro]] [[supercomputer]] (which Magneto helped design in the ''X-Men'' film series). He holds multiple [[doctorate]]s (see [[Professor X#Education|Education]]).

In his travels in the east, Xavier learned [[martial arts]], acquiring "refined" combat skills as Magneto would say. When these skills are coordinated in tandem with his [[precognition|precognitive]] abilities, Xavier becomes a proficient warrior capable of sensing incoming attacks and countering them efficiently. He has great knowledge of [[pressure points]]. When Charles served in the military, he specialized in search and rescue missions.

==Dark side==
In a number of comics, Xavier is shown to have a dark side, a part of himself that he struggles to suppress. Perhaps the most notable appearance of this character element is the "Onslaught" storyline, in which the [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] event's antagonist is a physical manifestation of that dark side. Also, Onslaught is created in the most violent act Xavier claims to have done: Erasing the mind of Magneto. In ''X-Men'' (first series) #106 (August 1977), the new X-Men fight images of the original team, which have been created by what Xavier says is his "evil self ... who would use his powers for personal gain and conquest," which he says he is normally able to keep in check. In Grant Morrison's ''New X-Men'' (first series) #121 (February 2002), Jean Grey and Emma Frost discover that Xavier killed his twin sister Cassandra Nova in the womb.

In other instances, Xavier is shown to be secretive and manipulative. During the "Onslaught" storyline, the X-Men find Xavier's files, the "[[Xavier Protocols]]", which detail how to kill many of the characters should the need ever arise.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Scott Lobdell]] | Penciller = [[Joe Madureira]] | Inker = [[Tim Townsend]] | Story = "Onslaught, Phase 1: Apocalypse Lives" | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Volume =  | Issue = 335 | Date = August 1996|Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' (third series) #12 (August 2005) reveals that when Xavier realized that the [[Danger Room]] had become sentient, he kept it trapped and  experimented on it for years, an act that Cyclops calls "the oppression of a new life" and equates to human's treatment of mutants. In ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'' #6, a de-powered Xavier is forced to admit that he had sent a group of hastily trained young mutants to [[Krakoa]] to save the original X-Men, resulting in their deaths. Because one of the mutants is [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' brother [[Vulcan (comics)|Vulcan]], Xavier erased Cyclops' memory of the event. He further manipulated the rescue team of new X-Men by making them think the meaningless noises the island made were intelligible speech&mdash;evidence that the island was alive&mdash;to match the new memories he had given Cyclops.

In the ''[[Mutant X]]'' comic book series, set outside the Marvel Universe continuity, Xavier travels the world capturing telepaths for the purpose of stealing their mental energy. Xavier takes control of S.H.I.E.L.D., captures Gambit's daughter, and attempts to kill the X-Men with a nuclear strike. An alternate-reality version of Xavier is the enemy in the first story arc of the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' series. In ''Ultimate X-Men'', Xavier frequently lies to other characters, including the X-Men, or even manipulates them when he feels it is necessary. Xavier tells the American president that he has killed Magneto, but instead he has blocked Magneto's memories and created a new personality and memories for him, along with a new life working with mentally challenged children. In issue #65, unbeknownst to the rest of the team, he directs Angel to become his mole in Emma Frost's Academy of Tomorrow in the guise of expelling the student. In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #58, he defuses a hostage situation by hiring the mutant bank robbers for a mission in which the X-Men cannot be implicated, and making the police believe they had killed them.

{{spoiler}}
In the film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', Wolverine questions Xavier's [[ethics]] when he discovers that the professor instituted mental blocks in the mind of Jean Grey to subdue her alternate personality. Xavier states that he does not have to answer to him and that he chose the lesser of two evils, as the [[Dark Phoenix|Phoenix persona]] is dangerous. After his death, he transfers his essence into a comatose man, committing himself to another nebulous moral front.

==Education==
'''Undergraduate studies''' 
*Charles Xavier graduated with [[Latin honors|honors]] at the age of 16 from [[Harvard University]].
'''Graduate studies''' 
*[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s in [[Genetics]], [[Biophysics]], and [[Psychology]]; two year residence at [[Oxford University]]
'''Other'''
*Appointed [[Professor]] [[Emeritus]] at [[Columbia University]]

==Romantic interests==
*[[Gabrielle Haller]]: [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]'s mother.
*[[Moira MacTaggert]]: Charles' ex-fiancée, Moira turns up as a lifetime friend who interacts with the X-Men often.
*[[Amelia Voght]]
*[[Lilandra]]: Lilandra forms an intense psychic bond with Xavier across the vast distance that separates their two planets, which leads her to him after she flees her Empire, in search of help against her villainous brother. They are wed until Lilandra annuls their marriage on the grounds that involvement with Xavier had caused trouble for the Shiar empire. No child has resulted from the union.
*[[Jean Grey]]: In one instance in the start of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' (issue #3), Professor X privately reflects upon his love for Jean Grey, but does not pursue it due to his feeling inadequate about being in a wheelchair, and the age difference and sacredness of the teacher-student relationship.<ref>X-Men [1st series]: 1&ndash;6, 11</ref> Although Xavier never again displays a romantic interest in Jean, the idea that he once entertained this thought becomes one of his "dark secrets" and is revisited when the Professor's dark side manifests in the form of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and reveals it to Jean. There is debate however that it is more a loving father figure relationship as Professor X has known Jean from the age of 11.

==Inspirations==
Professor Xavier's character is inspired by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]], and may also be a derivative of [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]], or Charles Xavier from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s 1962 book ''[[Pale Fire]].''  Writer [[Scott Lobdell]] established Xavier's middle name to be Francis in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #328 (January 1996).

==Alternate versions==
===Ultimate Charles Xavier===
[[Image:Ultimateprofx.JPG|150px|left|thumb|Ultimate Xavier. Art by [[Adam Kubert]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Professor Charles Xavier is the world's most powerful telepath, the founder and patron of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] and a world-famous lecturer for [[pacifism]] and mutant [[political emancipation|emancipation]]. In contrast to his mainstream version, he also has limited [[telekinetic]] abilities. He leaves his wife [[Moira MacTaggert]] with their sick son [[Legion (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|David]] to pursue [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] dream of a mutant society, but Magneto turns on him, crippling him with a spear. Xavier also repeatedly tampers with other people's minds to reach his goals, but he recognizes his flaws. He generally believes that reading minds without permission is unacceptable. In this timeline, his former love interests include [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Emma Frost]]. In Ultimate X-Men #77, he told [[Scott Summers #Ultimate Marvel|Cyclops]] that he is in love with [[Jean Grey|Jean]].

===Shadow Xavier===
In the first arc of [[New Excalibur]] the team is brought together partly as a response to a clash between [[Dazzler]] and a group of homocidal mutants bearing a resemblance to the Original X-Men. It turns out that these are the X-Men of an alternate universe where Charles Xavier was possessed by the [[Shadow King]] and had gone on to use his mind-controlled and thoroughly corrupted X-Men to wipe out all the other superhumans. This version of Xavier could walk, and insisted that his followers refer to him as 'Master'. He was eventually brain-fried for good during an abortive escape/hijack attempt by the mysterious black-ops splinter group [[Black Air]], though his 'Shadow X-Men' were successfully spirited away and so remain at liberty.

===Marvel 1602===
Professor X is Carlos Javier in the miniseries [[Marvel 1602]], set at the end of the [[Elizabethan Era]] in an alternate universe. He is the founder of a school for "witchbreed," and his students are the Marvel 1602 versions of the original X-Men. He relies on Hal McCoy (Beast) to carry him, as he is paralyzed from the waist down; his paralysis is not explained.

===Earth X===
In the [[Earth X]] reality, Professor X is killed when the new Red Skull's powers manifest themselves. All telepaths, including Professor X, are killed. Scott Summers aka [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] takes over the role of leader, recruiting a new team, who calls him Mr. S.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
Xavier has appeared in three different X-Men cartoons. The first is the 1989 pilot ''[[Pryde of the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]. Xaiver next appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]]'', which ran on [[Fox Kids]] from 1992&ndash;1997. Voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]], he appears in 20 episodes as a core member of the regular character lineup. Later, he appeared as a regular cast member in the [[Kids WB]] animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. Here, he is voiced by [[David Kaye]], who doubled as the voice for [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]].

Additionally, Xavier made frequent guest appearances on the animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' (voiced by [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]]).

===Films===
[[Image:Xaviermovie.jpg|225px|[[Patrick Stewart]] as Professor Xavier in ''X-Men: The Last Stand''.|thumb]]
Xavier appears in the three live-action feature film adaptations ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. He is played by [[Patrick Stewart]]. Stewart, who like Xavier is bald, and who gained fame among [[science fiction]] fans for his portrayal of [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Jean-Luc Picard]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', was a long-time fan favorite choice to play Xavier, before the movie was even announced. A Star Trek/X-Men crossover novel by [[Michael Jan Friedman]] called ''Planet X'' references this notion: When a group of [[time travel|time-traveling]] X-Men help the crew of the [[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise-E]] deal with a crisis, a hologram of Professor X briefly meets Picard, and the two characters are amused by their mutual resemblance. In [[Peter David]]'s ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'' novel Stone and Anvil, Picard remarks "I couldn't exactly see myself running a school for gifted youngsters"; this is believed to be a reference to Xavier.
{{spoilers}}
In the films, it is implied that Xavier is the most powerful mutant in the world. In the first ''X-Men'' film he was able to control both Sabretooth and Toad at the same time and speak through them, in an attempt to talk Magneto out of his plans against humans. In ''X2'', he can "freeze" crowds of people casually without the aid of Cerebro. When his powers were magnified by Cerebro he can locate ANY mutant in the world&mdash; and if he concentrates hard enough he can kill all mutants or humans and possibly everyone in the world.

In ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', released May 26, 2006, Xavier tries to help Jean Grey regain control of her seemingly unlimited powers but Phoenix completely takes over Jean and escapes the mansion. When Xavier follows her, Magneto has also located her and rather than starting a huge fight right there, Xavier lets Magneto come with him. Xavier tries to calmly talk Jean into returning to the mansion but Magneto foolishly turns the unstable Jean against the Professor. This causes Xavier to panic and speak to Jean in a less calm manner, now flatly telling her that she's a danger to everyone--even to herself. 
He uses the fact that Jean killed Scott to try to bring her back to the mansion, but it has the exact opposite effect he was hoping for, further angering the Phoenix instead of stunning her into realizing her evil potential.

After much argument, the Phoenix manifests its great powers as she tries to keep Xavier from re-establishing the psychic blocks in order to imprison it again. She pins Magneto on the ground, levitates the entire Grey manor (along with Wolverine, Storm, the Juggernaut, and Callisto), and holds Xavier afloat above his wheelchair as she and Xavier struggle (telepathically) for control of Jean's mind. It should be noted that although she disintegrates the Professor, [[Post-credits scene|after the credits]], it is revealed that he has transferred his mind into another body. On the DVD Commentary, it is revealed that the body on Muir Island was a "P. Xavier". One of the writers noted that this is an original twin brother, written for the scene, who was born braindead (due to Prof X's amount of power). This brother can apparently walk. This is an example of a [[comic book death]]; this scene was not in the script but was secretly added during filming.<ref> {{cite web| last = Douglas| first = Edward| title = That X-Men secret ending!| publisher = SuperHeroHype.com| date = 2006-05-29| url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/x-mennews.php?id=4307 | accessdate = 2006-10-14}}</ref>
Additionally, there is nothing in the film to suggest that the Juggernaut is related to Xavier.

===Video games===
Professor X appears in most of the X-Men video games. He is almost always an [[non-playable character|NPC]] and advises the X-Men on various missions in the role playing games. In the case of the fighting games, he appears in some of the characters' endings. He appears in the ''[[X-Men: Mutant Academy 2]]'' game for the Sony [[PlayStation]], as an unlockable playable character.

Xavier is also a playable character in the game ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', and its sequel ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' (in the first game, he is playable in one level; in the second, he is playable once all the Danger Room missions are completed. He also appears as a major NPC in both games). Patrick Stewart voices Xavier in both ''Legends'' games.

He has appeared as a NPC in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kane]].

==Notes==
There have been other characters in the [[Marvel Universe]] that have used the mantle of both '''Onslaught''' and '''Entity''', however Charles has been the only Professor X.

*In the [[Microverse]], a living planetoid that hatched multitude of eggs and then seeded them throughout space at [[tachyon speed]] was known as '''Entity'''.  It first appeared in ''Micronauts'' vol. 2 #1-2
*In 1870, an extraterrestrial creature known as '''Entity''', exposed humans to advanced weaponry but was convinced by the [[Rawhide Kid]] not to kill the Wizard of the West after he abused his weapons first appeared in ''Marvel Holiday Special 1996''
*A star-like being known as '''Entity''' was created by the merging of the Nest in ''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #1
*[[Protector (comics)|Protector]] was called '''Entity''' in ''Nova'' vol. 1 #8
*[[Ralphie Hutchins]]'s final evolution was known as '''Entity'''.  He was the embodiment of [[compassion]] and first appeared in ''She-Hulk'' vol. 1 #25. 
*The sentience of the Resurrection Stone, was known as '''Entity''' and first appeared in ''Defenders'' vol. 1 #104 and ''Avengers'' vol. 1 #209
*When [[Silver (comics)|Silver]] and [[Auric (comics)|Auric]] merged following their apparent deaths, they were known as '''Entity''' and the absorption of energy released from the implosion of the Sphinx appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 1 #121.  It initially sought to kill the [[Brass Bishop]] for attempting to auction off their bodies but was dissuaded by [[Vindicator|Heather Hudson]] and disappeared.
*A being that formerly dwelled within the Void dimension and possessed [[Mikhail Rasputin]] was known as '''Entity'''.  It drove him insane, causing him to create Gene Nation and first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #374, however was retcon to have possessed him in ''X-Men'' vol. 1 #28.
*A being known as '''Entity''' saved [[Beta Ray Bill]] from death while he was on [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] in ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #6
*In the [[Ultraverse]], there was a being known as the '''Entity "from the Moon"''' which first appeared in ''Break-Thru'' #1 but was mentioned in ''Strangers'' #1
*One of the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guardsmen]] is known as '''[[Onslaught (Imperial Guard)|Onslaught]]'''.  He was active during [[Kree/Shi'ar war]] and first appeared in ''Quasar'' #32.

==See also==
*[[Chief (comics)|Niles Caulder]] is the paraplegic leader of the original [[Doom Patrol]]. Like Professor X, Caulder recruits a group of reluctant outcasts to fight crime. Much has been made in the striking similarities between these two characters, as well as their respective series. For example, the X-Men fight the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], while the Doom Patrol fight the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. However, because of their close proximity to release (roughly a month), there is little merit to the argument that one is a copy of the other, and can be marked up as a coincidence, akin to the similarities between [[Swamp Thing]] and [[Man-Thing]].
