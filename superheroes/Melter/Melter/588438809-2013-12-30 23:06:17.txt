The '''Melter''' ('''Bruno Horgan''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The character first appears in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #47 (Nov. 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Sam Rosen (comics)|Sam Rosen]].

==Publication history==
The character debuted in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #47 (Nov. 1963) as an [[industrialist]] who specializes in providing [[munition]]s to the [[United States government]]. After an initial encounter with hero [[Iron Man]], the character reappears in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #6 (Jul. 1964) as part of supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]]. A version of the Masters of Evil return in ''Avengers'' #15 - 16 (Apr. - May 1965), with the Melter being jailed.

The Melter reappears to battle Iron Man in ''Tales of Suspense'' 89 - 90 (May - Jun. 1967), and then ''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (Jul. - Aug. 1968) as part of the next version of the Masters of Evil (formed without the villains knowledge by the [[robot]]  [[Ultron]]) and again in ''Avengers'' #83 (Dec. 1970). The character becomes a perennial villain in the title ''Iron Man'', appearing in issues #72 (Jan. 1974); #92 (Nov. 1976) and #123 - 124 (Jun. - Jul. 1979) and #127 (Oct. 1979).

After another attempt to [[sabotage]] the company [[Stark International]] in ''Iron Man'' #166 (Jan. 1983), the character reappears in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #96 (Feb. 1983) before being [[assassinated]] during the ''[[Scourge of the Underworld]]'' storyline in ''Avengers'' #263 (Jan. 1986). As writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated "Bruno Horgan was one of those villains who suited simpler times...Times moved on, though, and Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's creation didn't. Despite numerous upgrades to his weaponry, the Melter was never a major player."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

Long-time Marvel writer [[Roger Stern]] recalled:

{{cquote|...Mark Gruenwald had compiled a list of villains who were either less than inspired or had outlived their welcome. I picked the Melter because he was such a doof. There had been maybe one good Melter story...which had been repeated over and over again by various writers. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with the name.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

The character also made several posthumous appearances in the titles ''[[Fantastic Four]]'';<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #405 (Oct. 1995)</ref> ''X-O Manowar/Iron Man: Heavy Metal'';<ref>''X-O Manowar/Iron Man: Heavy Metal'' #1 (Sep. 1996)</ref> and ''Avengers''.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #8 - 9 (June - July 1997)</ref>

Another character using the name "Melter" debuted during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline in the limited series ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1 - 5 (July - Dec. 2009).

==Fictional character biography==
===Bruno Horgan===
Bruno Horgan is driven into [[bankruptcy]] when a government safety inspection team proves that he is using inferior materials, with the defense contracts awarded to his competitor, [[Tony Stark]] (the [[alter ego]] of hero [[Iron Man]]).  Discovering that one of his faulty devices is capable of generating a beam capable of "melting" anything composed of [[iron]], Horgan redesigns the device so that it can be strapped to his chest, and after donning a costume adopts the alias the Melter. As the Melter, Horgan becomes a professional criminal and embarks on a campaign of industrial sabotage against Stark, hoping to ruin him, eventually encountering Iron Man after Stark is told he could lose his government contracts, though when he first met Stark he succeeded in knocking him out. Despite damaging the hero's armor and forcing Iron Man back, the Melter is defeated when Stark builds a temporary duplicate armor composed of [[aluminium]], but leaps into the sewer, though Stark is unaware whether he was killed or not.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #47 (Nov. 1963)</ref>

The Melter reappears as an employee of master villain [[Baron Zemo]] (who has upgraded the melting beam to affect all metals) as part of supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]]. He helps spray Adhesive X over the city. The Melter meets Iron Man as the Avengers first meet the Masters, but Iron Man knocks him away using his magnetic repulsor. The Masters were defeated with the Melter being jailed after Iron Man drenches him with water, preventing his beam from working.<ref>''Avengers'' #6 (Jul. 1964)</ref> The Radioactive Man was [[deport]]ed back to China, while the Black Knight and Melter are placed in a cell with bars chemically treated so they cannot be melted. The Masters of Evil have a second encounter with the Avengers after the Black Knight and Melter are broken out of jail by the Enchantress and Executioner. The Melter nearly finishes Iron Man after welding his boots to a roof, but he is stopped by Thor using his uru hammer, which the Melter cannot melt. The Masters of Evil are eventually defeated after Thor transported them and the Avengers to another dimension, with different scientific laws which meant their weapons rebounded. The villains are bound and returned to Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #15 - 16 (Apr. - May 1965)</ref> The character upgrades his weaponry and battles Iron Man once again,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' 89 - 90 (May - Jun. 1967)</ref> before reappearing as part of the next version of the Masters of Evil, although the villains are defeated when betrayed by the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (Jul. - Aug. 1968)</ref> The Masters of Evil - with the Melter - also accidentally encounter the Avengers during a [[parade]] and during the battle are defeated when surprised by the superheroines the [[Lady Liberators]].<ref>''Avengers'' #83 (Dec. 1970)</ref>

The Melter has several battles with Iron Man: at the direction of other-dimensional villain the [[Black Lama]], the Melter joins fellow villains [[Blacklash|Whiplash]] and the [[Man-Bull]] to form the team the [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] and attempt to kill the hero;<ref>''Iron Man'' #72 (Jan. 1974)</ref> upgrades once again and attack before being defeated;<ref>''Iron Man'' #92 (Nov. 1976)</ref> and reappears, with many other villains, as an employee of criminal mastermind [[Justin Hammer]]. At Hammer's direction the Melter and fellow villains have a series of encounters with Iron Man in an unsuccessful attempt to neutralize the hero.<ref>''Iron Man'' #123 - 124 (Jun. - Jul. 1979); #127 (Oct. 1979)</ref> After another attempt to [[sabotage]] the company [[Stark International]]<ref>''Iron Man'' #166 (Jan. 1983)</ref> the character makes a brief appearance with other villains in an unsuccessful attempt to kill [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #96 (Feb. 1983)</ref>

Eventually, the Melter manages to augment his melting ray's power to its peak, but before he can employ it, he is surprised and murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who is disguised as the villain's [[laboratory]] assistant. The Scourge destroys the latest melting ray right afterwards.<ref>''Avengers'' #263 (Jan. 1986)</ref>

The second '''Melter''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The character first appears in ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'': Young Avengers'' #1 (July 2009) and was created by [[Paul Cornell]] and [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]].

Christopher Colchiss later adopts the Melter name and is recruited to lead the "Young Masters", a teenage super team opposing the [[Young Avengers]]. This Melter has inherent melting super powers and does not require artificial aids. Unlike the original Melter, his abilities also extend to humans.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1 - 5 (July - Dec. 2009)</ref>

Melter has serious doubts about the moral conviction of most his teammates, and twice he has made mistakes with his powers that killed people - his parents when he was young and more recently an old lady who maced him in the face thinking he was a mugger. Melter also caused a subway station to collapse by melting its supports by accident, though without causing any serious casualties. These incidents have resulted in making him extremely hesitant to use his powers in combat. Melter desires to be a hero, but is unsure just what he needs to do in order to be one.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #4</ref>

Colchiss was later recruited by [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] and [[Zeke Stane]] to assist the other Iron Man villains in taking down Iron Man. Colchiss received an upgraded suit from Mandarin and Zeke Stane.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bruno Horgan invents a device which projected a form of energy that loosened the bonding forces between the [[molecule]]s of substances, causing these substances to change from solid form to liquid form, thereby melting. The Melter's first melting beam could affect [[iron]], while a later version could affect almost any substance. The melting effect did not appear to involve heat, but when used on a human being, the beam inflicts burns as opposed to truly melting. The Melter uses several of these devices, including hand-held pistol versions and a device worn on his torso in a harness. Horgan possesses extensive knowledge of weapons and munitions.

The second Melter can mentally agitate the molecules in solid matter so that it loses cohesion, thereby melting the object in question. Christopher has not been shown to be able to produce actual fire. He has melted bullets while they're in the air, and can even melt people with fatal effects.

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
In the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe created by [[Franklin Richards]], Bruno Horgan/Melter appeared as a member of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 2 #8</ref>

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
The Melter appears in ''Iron Man: Coming of the Melter'', a one-shot set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] between the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 3]]''. In the comic, Bruno Hogan was a former inventor who failed to pitch his armor to the United States military. He later modified his design and used it to attack Iron Man and [[War Machine]], hoping to use the publicity to sell his suit to the highest bidder. The plan backfired when the two heroes defeated Melter and destroyed his armor.<ref>''Iron Man: Coming of the Melter'' #1</ref>
