The '''Melter''' ('''Bruno Horgan''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  The character first appears in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #47 (Nov. 1963) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Sam Rosen (comics)|Sam Rosen]].

==Publication history==
The character debuted in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #47 (Nov. 1963) as an [[industrialist]] who specializes in providing [[munition]]s to the [[United States government]]. After an initial encounter with hero [[Iron Man]], the character reappears in [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #6 (Jul. 1964) as part of supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]]. A version of the Masters of Evil return in ''Avengers'' #15 - 16 (Apr. - May 1965), with the Melter being jailed.

The Melter reappears to battle Iron Man in ''Tales of Suspense'' 89 - 90 (May - Jun. 1967), and then ''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (Jul. - Aug. 1968) as part of the next version of the Masters of Evil (formed without the villains knowledge by the [[robot]]  [[Ultron]]) and again in ''Avengers'' #83 (Dec. 1970). The character becomes a perennial villain in the title ''Iron Man'', appearing in issues #72 (Jan. 1974); #92 (Nov. 1976) and #123 - 124 (Jun. - Jul. 1979) and #127 (Oct. 1979). 

After another attempt to [[sabotage]] the company [[Stark International]] in ''Iron Man'' #166 (Jan. 1983), the character reappears in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #96 (Feb. 1983) before being [[assassinated]] during the ''[[Scourge of the Underworld]]'' storyline in ''Avengers'' #263 (Jan. 1986). As writer [[Mike Conroy]] stated "Bruno Horgan was one of those villains who suited simpler times...Times moved on, though, and Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's creation didn't. Despite numerous upgrades to his weaponry, the Melter was never a major player."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

Long-time Marvel writer [[Roger Stern]] recalled:

{{cquote|...Mark Gruenwald had complied a list of villains who were either less than inspired or had outlived their welcome. I picked the Melter because he was such a doof. There had been maybe one good Melter story...which had been repeated over and over again by various writers. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with the name.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

The character also made several posthumous appearances in the titles ''[[Fantastic Four]]'';<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #405 (Oct. 1995)</ref> ''X-O Manowar/Iron Man: Heavy Metal'';<ref>''X-O Manowar/Iron Man: Heavy Metal'' #1 (Sep. 1996)</ref> and ''Avengers''.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #8 - 9 (June - July 1997)</ref>

==Biography==
Bruno Horgan is driven into [[bankruptcy]] when a government safety inspection team proves that he is using inferior materials, with the defense contracts awarded to his competitor, [[Tony Stark]] (the [[alter ego]] of hero [[Iron Man]]).  Discovering that one of his faulty devices is capable of generating a beam capable of "melting" anything composed of [[iron]], Horgan redesigns the device so that it can be strapped to his chest, and after donning a costume adopts the alias the Melter. As the Melter, Horgan becomes a professional criminal and embarks on a campaign of industrial sabotage, eventually encountering Iron Man. Despite damaging the hero's armor, the Melter is defeated when Stark builds a temporary duplicate armor composed of [[aluminium]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #47 (Nov. 1963)</ref>

The character reappears as an employee of master villain [[Baron Zemo]] (who has upgraded the melting beam to effect all metals) as part of supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>''Avengers'' #6 (Jul. 1964)</ref> The Masters of Evil have a second encounter with the Avengers, and are eventually defeated, with the Melter being jailed.<ref>''Avengers'' #15 - 16 (Apr. - May 1965)</ref> The character upgrades his weaponry and battles Iron Man once again,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' 89 - 90 (May - Jun. 1967)</ref> before reappearing as part of the next version of the Masters of Evil, although the villains are defeated when betrayed by the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]].<ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (Jul. - Aug. 1968)</ref> The Masters of Evil - with the Melter - also accidentally encounter the Avengers during a [[parade]] and during the battle are defeated when surprised by the superheroines the [[Lady Liberators]].<ref>''Avengers'' #83 (Dec. 1970)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Bruno Horgan invents a device which projected a form of energy that loosened the bonding forces between the [[molecule]]s of substances, causing these substances to change from solid form to liquid form, thereby melting. The Melter's first melting beam could affect [[iron]], while a later version could affect almost any substance. The melting effect did not appear to involve heat, but when used on a human being, the beam inflicts burns as opposed to truly melting. The Melter uses several of these devices, including hand-held pistol versions and a device worn on his torso in a harness. Horgan possesses extensive knowledge of weapons and munitions.

== Melter II ==
Another character using the name "Melter" debuts during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline in the title ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers''. The second Melter is a teenage boy, recruited to lead the "Young Masters," a teenage super power team opposing the [[Young Avengers]]."  This version has inherent melting super powers and does not require artificial aids.  Unlike the original Melter, his abilities also extend to humans, and are fatal (capable of fatally melting as opposed to burning).<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1 - 5 (July - Dec. 2009)</ref>

==In other media==
The Melter appears in the Iron Man segment of the [[animated]] [[television series]] ''[[The Marvel Superheroes]]'' (1966) voiced by [[Bernard Cowan]], and the ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Charlie Adler]] (2009).

The character also appears in the [[arcade]] game ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]'' (1991) and the [[video game]] ''[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) voiced by Gavin Hammon.
