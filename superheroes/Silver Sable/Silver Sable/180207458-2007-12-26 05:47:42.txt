'''Silver Sable''' ('''Silver Sablinova''') is a fictional character from [[Marvel Comics]], a female [[mercenary]], hunter of war criminals, the leader of the [[Wild Pack]], and CEO of Silver Sable International. Though a legitimate mercenary, her methods and motives have sometimes brought her into conflict with other [[superheroes]].

==Publication history==
Silver Sable first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #265 (June 1985). After that she made occasional appearances in various Spider-Man titles, often (but not always) as an ally. On June 1992 [[Marvel Comics]] began to publish the series ''Silver Sable And The Wild Pack'', written by [[Gregory Wright]] and penciled by [[Steven Butler]]. This series lasted for 35 issues, until it was cancelled along with many other Marvel series in 1995.

After the cancellation, Silver made occasional guest appearances in various comics until early 2006. At that point a [[limited series]] began featuring Silver Sable and [[Dominic Fortune]] titled ''Sable and Fortune''. Originally solicited as a six issue series, ''Sable and Fortune'' was shortened to four issues after the release of issue one.

==Fictional character biography==
The operations of Wild Pack and Silver Sable International drive the national economy of the fictional small European state of Symkaria. The name 'Wild Pack' had been used by the mercenary squad led by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] for some time, until a legal notice forced them to change it to 'Six Pack'.

The State of [[Symkaria]] is adjacent to [[Latveria]], the nation that is ruled by [[Doctor Doom]]. Silver Sable and Victor Von Doom have an annual diplomatic dinner at Castle Doom, situated in Doomstadt. Apparently the friendship between these two states is deep-rooted and dates back to World War II. 

The family of Silver Sable is composed of her father, Ernst Sablinova, her uncle Morty, and a young cousin, Anna (orphaned daughter of another, unnamed uncle or aunt). Silver's mother was killed by enemies of her father, who ran a Nazi-hunting group. Silver was married to the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]], an international assassin and the head of the 1400 Club, but they “divorced” when she discovered his real work. Their relation today isn't completely clear, sometimes they treat one another as friends, sometimes they tolerate the presence of the other, sometimes they try to kill each other.

Uncle Morty functions as Sable's assistant. He organizes the missions, keeps track of the accounting part and many times tries to remind Sable to retain her focus and sense of judgement.

Silver supports Anna's boarding school education and seemingly nothing more. Her feelings were betrayed when [[HYDRA]] agents took over the school and killed Anna's best friend. Sable infiltrated the school, rescuing the survivors with the unwanted aid of [[Spider-Man]] and the aid of some of her troops, against orders.

Silver has collaborated with various superheroes, including the aforementioned Spider-Man, [[Punisher|the Punisher]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], [[Captain America]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], and many others. [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], a reformed Spider-Man villain, was a mercenary for the Silver Sable International for a long time, heading the Intruders, the squad of superpowered mercenaries in the employ of the Silver Sable International. Other heroes and reformed minor villains work for Silver Sable International on occasion.

Like her father, Sable's squad focuses on bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, though they have taken on many other types of missions. Her group is loyal to a fault, often flagrantly disobeying orders if they believe it is for the greater good.

Sable's relationship with Doctor Doom would prove almost-fatal as the annual dinner happened to fall on the time when Doctor Doom's castle had been over-taken by an alien impersonator during the [[Infinity War]] crisis. The double did look different, something Sable put down to Doom's desires to change his look. During the dinner, Sable's driver is killed by Doom's robots and a human butler is killed by the Doom double. Sable protests the brutality and is attacked herself, leading to a chase throughout the castle. Again defying her, her soldiers came to rescue her, despite Sandman himself also having been replaced.

Later, Sable was hired to protect Professor Wolfgang Von Hessler, who was holed up in the Symkarian monastery of St. Eboars. Wolfgang knew of a powerful genetic weapon and, attacked by guilt, was working on a neutralizing agent was planning to give to the world so the weapon would be useless. 

Most of Sable's Wild Pack were out on assignments, so she hired a new team. The Cat, a martial artist, [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] and what she thought was Nomad but turned out to be [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]. The group fought the [[Heroes for Hire]], who had been hired to take the Professor. Sable's team had the upper hand until [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] freed his Heroes allies and Power Man turned traitor, sending the professor off to the villain [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Silver Sable===

In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Silver Sable is a mercenary from Symkaria. This version of the character made her original appearance in the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man game]] but later appeared as the central villain in an Ultimate Spider-Man story arc titled after her. She leads a mercenary organization known as the Wild Pack, and is skilled enough to best Peter Parker in hand to hand combat. She had a troubled childhood, apparently ignored by her father and abused by her [[alcoholic]] mother. In reality, her father [[Nazi hunter|hunted]] [[Nazism|Nazis]], and she forgave him at his deathbed and decided to follow in his footsteps.  While she has, so far, only appeared as an antagonist to Spider-Man, she is not actually a villain so much as a bounty hunter, and she holds no particular ill-will towards Spider-Man. She isn't necessarily a good person either, though, as in the Spider-Man game she threatened Peter Parker's family as a means of getting Peter to work with her to control [[Venom (comics)#Ultimate Venom|Venom]]. Never having been told her real name, Spider-Man jokingly calls her "Crazy Lady" and, in the game, "Crazy Silver Hottie".

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Sixforgottenwarriorspt2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Silver Sable and her Wild Pack in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 animated series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']]
In other media, she has appeared in the Six Forgotten Warriors saga of the animated Spider-Man series on Fox, voiced by [[Mira Furlan]]. The Wild Pack accompanied her, and she served as both an ally and enemy to Spider-Man against both the Kingpin and the Red Skull. 

Silver Sable and her Wild Pack appeared during Spider-Man The Animated Series [[1994]], first fighting against, and then alongside [[Spider-Man]].

Silver Sable also appeared in two episodes of MTV's [[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]] in [[2003]] and was voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]]. In "Spider-Man Dis-Sabled," Spider-Man encounters Sable attempting to assassinate the mayor of [[New York City]] and a European Union Guest. As it turns out, the European Union Guest is really an undercover assassin planning to kill the president when he gets the chance. When Silver Sable discovers that Peter Parker (Spider-Man) had caught her on surveillance when she had attempted to kill the European, she attacks Peter's apartment and kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]], Harry Osborn and Indy. Peter later discovers that Silver Sable is also posing as the mayor's assistant, but before he can stop her from kidnapping the mayor and The European, he first has to save his friends, which gives her time to get away. Spider-Man eventually catches up to her, though, and the two have a final showdown on top of the mayor's limo. It ends with the limo crashing off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. Spider-Man saves the limo before it hits the water, but Silver Sable falls off and (apparently) drowns.

Sable later made her last appearance in Mind Games: Part One in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series.  She joined [[Kraven the Hunter]] who wanted to kill Spider-Man when the super hero put the criminal in a [[Gulag]].  Sable was then caught by Spider-Man in a confrontation between Spider-Man and Kraven and Sable and she was taken to jail.  But in the process, she told Kraven "There are other ways to get revenge on Spider-Man."  Kraven used this information and killed Mary Jane Watson.  However, this appearance of Sable was fake as it was merely a  false scheme by the Gaines Twins when they hypnotized Spider-Man into thinking Kraven killed Mary Jane so Spider-Man can kill Kraven (they have grudge against Kraven when he killed their parents in the past).

===Video games===
====[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]====
Silver Sable appeared in the [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] game in [[2005]] as an assassin trying to hunt down both [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ultimate Venom|Venom]].  Apparently, in the game, Sable knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man, whereas in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' comics she does not.  This hints that this game is not canon to these comics but in the game. In the portable version, she kidnaps Spider-Man, firing on him with a tranquilizer, however Spider-Man escapes and bests her in hand to hand without using his spider powers.  However, after several more tranquilizer shots, Venom shows up and knocks her unconscious, and Spider-Man changes into the red-and-blue costume and must defend her from Venom.  After Venom is defeated, Spider-Man falls unconscious due to the tranquilizer. She is later seen before the final battle against Venom, saying that her contract with Bolivar Trask expired and that he doesn't know how to fly the helicopter that he is trying to escape from Venom with.

====[[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]====
Silver Sable appeared in [[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]], a video game loosely based on the [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] universe. In it, she is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to deal with his 'unpleasant business affairs'. She is a boss battle for [[Spider-Man]] and [[Green Goblin]] in the game.

====[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]====
Silver Sable appeared as an unlockable character in the game. This is her first playable appearance in a video game.
