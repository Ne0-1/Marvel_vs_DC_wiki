'''Silver Sable''' ('''Silver Sablinova''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a [[mercenary]], hunter of war criminals, leader of the [[Wild Pack]], and owner of Silver Sable International. Although sometimes a legitimate mercenary, her methods and motives have sometimes brought her into conflict with other [[superhero]]es. Occasionally, she is seen as an ally of [[Spider-Man]] and other heroes.

==Publication history==
[[File:SilverSable3.gif|left|upright|thumb|Silver Sable on the cover of ''Silver Sable'' #3]]

Created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]], Silver Sable first appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #265 (June 1985). The inspiration for the character comes from safari cards bought by DeFalco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/13/comic-book-legends-revealed-313/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #313|editor=[[Comic Book Resources]]|author=Brian Cronin|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> After her debut, she made occasional appearances in various Spider-Man titles, often (but not always) as an ally. [[Marvel Comics]] began to publish the series ''Silver Sable & The Wild Pack'' in June 1992, written by [[Gregory Wright (comics)|Gregory Wright]] and penciled by [[Steven Butler]]. This series lasted for 35 issues, until it was canceled along with many other Marvel series in 1995.

After the cancellation, Silver made occasional guest appearances in various comics until early 2006. At that point a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] began featuring Silver Sable and [[Dominic Fortune]] titled ''Sable and Fortune''. Originally solicited as a six issue series, ''Sable and Fortune'' was shortened to four issues after the release of issue one.

==Fictional character biography==
The operations of Wild Pack and Silver Sable International drive the national economy of the fictional small European state of Symkaria. The name ''Wild Pack'' had been used by the mercenary squad led by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] for some time, until a legal notice forced them to change it to ''Six Pack''.<ref>''Cable Blood and Metal'' #1</ref>

The State of [[Symkaria]] is adjacent to [[Latveria]], the nation ruled by [[Doctor Doom]]. Silver Sable and Victor Von Doom have an annual diplomatic dinner at Castle Doom, situated in Doomstadt. Apparently the friendship between these two states is deep-rooted and dates back to World War II.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #4</ref>

The family of Silver Sable is composed of her father Ernst Sablinov, her uncle Morty, and the young cousin Anna (orphaned daughter of an unnamed uncle or aunt). Silver's mother was killed in front of her by enemies of her father, who ran a Nazi-hunting group. Due to this traumatic event and her Father's subsequent harsh training and treatment of her, Silver Sable has dedicated herself to being both as emotionless and as effective as possible in her professional life. Silver has been known only to let one emotion—rage—overcome her reason, almost uniformly when facing Nazi opponents or those who threaten her family. Other subsequent mistakes involving emotion have only added to her self-imposed need to control herself and affect an "ice queen" persona. Most notably, Silver fell in love with and was married to the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]],{{issue|date=September 2014}} an international assassin and the head of the 1400 Club, but they "divorced" when she discovered his real work. Their relation today varies between friendship, mere mutual tolerance, and attempts to kill each other.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #16</ref>

Uncle Morty functions as Sable's assistant. Morty organizes the missions, keeps track of the accounting part, and many times tries to remind Sable to retain her focus and sense of judgment (as Silver's iron-clad emotional control and occasional fits of temper are often only softened by feelings for her family).

Silver supports Anna's boarding school education and seemingly nothing more. Her feelings are betrayed when [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] agents take over the school and kill Anna's best friend. Sable infiltrates the school, rescuing the survivors with the unwanted aid of Spider-Man and the aid of some of her troops, against orders.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #1</ref>

Silver once hunts the international criminal the [[Black Fox (Raul Chalmers)|Black Fox]] to recover valuable gems stolen by the thief, but is inadvertently thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #265</ref> She is hired by a South African republic to neutralize the international terrorist [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. She enlists Spider-Man's aid against the [[Sinister Syndicate]], and first forms an alliance with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #279-281</ref> Some time later, she joins forces with Spider-Man, [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]], and [[Captain America]] to track down [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and the [[Red Skull]], who mastermind a plot to put the United States against Symkaria.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #320-325</ref> The group is hired to clear up a decade's old conspiracy resulting from a failed terrorist attack on New York City.<ref>''Daredevil'' #320 (November 1993)</ref>

She later hired Spider-Man to steal incriminating documents from a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] money launderer, and then first encountered the Outlaws.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #50</ref> An intelligence mission in Iraq resulted in the death of a Wild Pack member, and she denied compensation to the slain man's family due to his negligence.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #5</ref> She devised an initiation test for the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] to join the Outlaws, and taught a lesson in humility.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> She hired the Outlaws to retrieve a Symkarian nuclear device in England.<ref>''Excalibur'' #36</ref> She hired the Outlaws to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a Canadian official.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #25; ''The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #11; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #7</ref> With the help of Spider-Man, Sandman, and the Wild Pack, she rescued her niece from a kidnapping by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]].<ref>''Silver Sable'' #1</ref> She then encountered a Doctor Doom doppelganger.<ref>''Silver Sable'' #4-5</ref>

Silver has collaborated with various superheroes, including the aforementioned Spider-Man, the [[Punisher]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], Captain America, [[Deadpool]] and many others. [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] was a mercenary for Silver Sable International for a long time, heading the Intruders, the squad of superpowered mercenaries in the employ of Silver Sable International. Other heroes and reformed minor villains work for Silver Sable International on occasion.

Like her father, Sable's squad focuses on bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, though they have taken on many other types of missions. Her group often flagrantly disobeys orders if they believe it is for the greater good.

Sable's surprisingly cordial diplomatic relationship with Doctor Doom would prove almost-fatal as the annual dinner happened to fall on the time when Doctor Doom's castle had been overtaken by an alien impersonator during the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]] crisis. The double did look different, something Sable put down to Doom's desires to change his look. During the dinner, Sable's driver is killed by Doom's robots and a human butler is killed by the Doom double. Sable protests the brutality and is attacked herself, leading to a chase throughout the castle. Again defying her, her soldiers came to rescue her, despite Sandman himself also having been replaced.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Later, Sable was hired to protect Professor Wolfgang Von Hessler holed up in the Symkarian monastery of St. Eboars. Wolfgang knew of a powerful genetic weapon and, attacked by guilt, was working on a neutralizing agent to give to the world so the weapon would be useless.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Most of Sable's Wild Pack were out on assignments, so she hired a new team. The Cat, a martial artist, [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], and what she thought was [[Jack Monroe (comics)|Nomad]] but turned out to be [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]]. The group fought the [[Heroes for Hire]], who had been hired to take the Professor. Sable's team had the upper hand until Deadpool freed his Heroes allies and Power Man turned traitor, sending the professor off to the villain [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Silver Sable ends up paired up with [[Misty Knight]], [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], and [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] when [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] Ninjas end up secretly targeting members of the mafia.<ref>''Shadowland: Blood on the Streets'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline involving one of [[Doctor Octopus]]' schemes, Silver Sable recovers Spider-Man and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] after the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are defeated by the [[Sinister Six]]—Spider-Man because of experience with the Six and Widow simply because she was the Avenger closest to Sable's cloaked plane. She joins them in an attack on a Sahara facility controlled by Doctor Octopus, with the three successfully defeating Sandman after Spider-Man's allies at Horizon Labs helped determine a means of identifying the one particle of sand containing Sandman's consciousness.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #684</ref> She is apparently drowned by the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in the final battle when Rhino pins her to the ground in a flooding corridor in Doctor Octopus' base, Rhino preferring to die after the loss of his own wife and knowing that Spider-Man will blame himself for the death even if Doctor Octopus' plan is stopped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687</ref>

[[Julia Carpenter|Madame Web]] later claims to Spider-Man that Silver Sable did not perish in the fight within Doctor Octopus' underwater base.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #690</ref>

She is later seen with other dead people in a post-mortem experience by Peter Parker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700</ref>

She has since returned alive,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol.4 #25</ref> to request Spider-Man's help in thwarting a recent coup of Symkaria organized by Norman Osborn.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol.4 #26</ref> Sable explains that she survived her confrontation with the Rhino by using her suit to cloak herself, distracting him long enough for her to escape, using her 'official' death to discreetly hunt down most of her enemies.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol.4 #27</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Silver Sable is an athletic woman with no superhuman powers. She is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and skilled in various martial arts, and she is an expert marksman, swordsman, and gymnast. She also possesses strong leadership capabilities.

Silver Sable wears synthetic stretch fabric lined with Kevlar throughout the torso. She often carries a saber or rapier (dueling sword), chai (three-pronged half-moon throwing projectiles), a 9mm pistol and derringer.

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] iteration of Silver Sable is the mercenary leader of the Wild Pack.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #86</ref> A mercenary from Symkaria, she had a troubled childhood, apparently ignored by her father and abused by her [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother. In reality, her father [[Nazi hunter|hunted]] [[Nazism|Nazis]] and she forgave him at his deathbed and decided to follow in his footsteps. While an antagonist to Spider-Man, she is not actually a villain so much as a [[bounty hunter]], and she holds no particular ill-will towards Spider-Man.<ref name="USM89">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #89</ref>

As the central antagonist in the "Silver Sable" story arc, Silver Sable is hired by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Donald Roxxon]] to capture [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] for questioning.  After weeks of tracking, Sable's mercenaries mistakenly capture [[Flash Thompson]]. As they discussed whether to murder Thompson to prevent from identifying them, Flash escaped. Sable's Wild Pack later captured and brought Spider-Man to Roxxon, who wants to know why Spider-Man has been defending his company from supervillain attacks. Not believing Spider-Man's explanation that he was only in a position to defend the company through sheer chance, Sable and Roxxon run a background check on him, but this causes a high level [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] alert. While listening to Roxxon's argument for protection, Sable's Wild Pack are attacked by the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref name="USM89"/> After escaping the chaos, Sable threateningly demands Roxxon in paying the reward money and swears she will kill Roxxon if their names are told to the authorities.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #90</ref>

However, Sable spares Spider-Man from being taken by the Wild Pack as a "bonus" and "thanks" for subduing Venom.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #124</ref> After delivering Venom to Trask, Sable's Wild Pack provide security for Trask's experiment to remove the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote. However, the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] breached the facility, paralyzing Sable with knockout gas.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #125</ref> Sable's Wild Pack later fights with the Venom symbiote after organism abandoned Brock and possessed Spider-Man. Sable's Wild Pack tries to subdue Venom, but were unable to until the [[Ultimates]] arrive. Despite trying to escape and talk their way, the Ultimates take into custody the Wild Pack with Sable being tranquilized by the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. Sable and the Pack were then imprisoned by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #126</ref>

Sable is first seen hired by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Rheinholt Kragor]] in order to gather information about the Doomsday device, capture two scientists in order to help operate it, and to keep it from falling into the hands of Kingpin. Sable later kidnaps Spider-Man, Kingpin and the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] for Rheinholt.

* Silver Sable appears in two episodes of ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In the episode "Spider-Man Dis-Sabled", Spider-Man encounters Silver Sable, apparently attempting to assassinate the mayor of [[New York City]] and European Union Guest Harlan Tremain. As it turns out, Tremain is really the Piranha, an undercover terrorist planning to kill the President. When Silver Sable discovers that Peter Parker had caught her on surveillance when she had attempted to kill him, she attacks Peter's apartment and kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Harry Osborn]] and [[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series#Recurring characters|Indy]]. Peter later discovers that Sable is also posing as the mayor's assistant Jane Perkins but before Spider-Man can stop her from kidnapping the mayor and Tremaine, Spider-Man first has to save Peter's friends, which gives her time to get away. Spider-Man eventually catches up to her, though, and the two have a final showdown on top of the mayor's limo. It ends with the limo crashing off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. Spider-Man saves the limo before it hits the water, but Silver Sable falls off and she swims away shown by her air bubbles in the water. In the episode "Mind Games" (Part One), Silver Sable joins with [[Kraven the Hunter]] wanting to kill Spider-Man as revenge. Sable was then caught by Spider-Man and taken to jail. In the process, she told Kraven "There are other ways to get revenge on Spider-Man.". Kraven was thus inspired to kill Mary Jane. However, Sable's appearance was an illusion and part of a scheme by the Gaines twins to manipulate Spider-Man into thinking Kraven killed Mary Jane in the hopes that Spider-Man would kill Kraven. The Gaines twins sought vengeance for Kraven's murder of their father. Information on a computer screen indicates that Silver Sable comes from Russia instead of the fictional country of Symkaria.

Afterwards, she and the Wild Pack invade Horizon High to steal the Neuro Cortex where they outfight Spider-Man. When Spider-Man trails them outside of Manhattan, Silver Sable gave Spider-Man the option to pay them off to give up the Neuro Cortex. When Doctor Octopus arrives, Spider-Man receives his help in fighting the Wild Pack. Spider-Man fights Silver Sable on her jet and defeats her.

===Film===
In March 2017, it was reported that [[Sony Pictures]] was developing a [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and Silver Sable-centered film with writer [[Christopher Yost]]. It is intended to be a part of a [[shared universe]] called [[Sony's Marvel Universe]], centered on characters from the ''Spider-Man'' mythology, beginning with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' in 2018. The films will be more adult-oriented and though they take place in the "same reality" as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], they will not crossover with each other.<ref>http://screenrant.com/sony-venom-movie-mcu-connections/</ref> In May 2017, it was announced that [[Gina Prince-Bythewood]] would direct the film, now titled ''Silver & Black''.<ref>{{cite news|title='Spider-Man' Spinoff: Silver Sable, Black Cat Movie Finds Director with 'Secret Life of Bees' Filmmaker (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-spinoff-silver-sable-black-cat-movie-finds-director-secret-life-bees-filmmaker-1007556|accessdate=May 25, 2017|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 25, 2017}}</ref> Production was to begin in March 2018, but has been delayed "indefinitely".
