'''Silver Sable''' (real name '''Silver Sablinova''') is a female [[mercenary]], hunter of war criminals, the leader of the [[Wild Pack]] and CEO of Silver Sable International. Though usually regarded as a [[superhero]], her methods and motives have sometimes brought her into conflict with other superheroes.

The operations of Wild Pack and Silver Sable International drive the national economy of the fictional small European state of Symkaria. The State of [[Symkaria]] is adjacent to [[Latveria]], the nation that is ruled by [[Doctor Doom]]. Silver Sable and Victor Von Doom have an annual diplomatic dinner at Castle Doom, situated in Doomstadt. Apparently the friendship between these two states is deep-rooted and dates back to World War II.

The family of Silver Sable is composed of her father, Ernst Sablinova, her uncle Morty, and a young cousin, Anna (orphaned daughter of another, unnamed uncle or aunt). Silver was married to the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]], an international assassin and the head of the 1400 Club, but they “divorced” when she discovered his real work. Their relation today isn't completely clear, sometimes they treat one another as friends, sometimes they tolerate the presence of the other, sometimes they try to kill each other.

Silver has collaborated with various superheroes, including [[Spider-Man]], [[the Punisher]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], [[Captain America]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], and many others. [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], a reformed Spider-Man villain, was a mercenary for the Silver Sable International for a long time, heading the Intruders, the squad of superpowered mercenaries in the employ of the Silver Sable International. Other heroes and reformed minor villains work for Silver Sable International on occasion.

==Publication history==
Silver Sable first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #265 (June 1985). After that she made occasional appearances in various Spider-Man titles, often (but not always) as an ally. On June 1992 [[Marvel Comics]] began to publish the series ''Silver Sable And The Wild Pack'', written by [[Gregory Wright]] and penciled by [[Steven Butler]]. This series lasted for 35 issues, until it was cancelled along with many other Marvel series in 1995.

After the cancellation, Silver made occasional guest appearances in various comics until early 2006. At that point a [[limited series]] began featuring Silver Sable and [[Dominic Fortune]] titled ''Sable and Fortune''. Originally solicited as a six issue series, ''Sable and Fortune'' was shortened to four issues after the release of issue one. Rumors are circulating that she will be a member of the newest incarnation of [[Heroes For Hire]].

==Ultimate Silver Sable==

In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Silver Sable is a mercenary from Symkaria. Although she made her original appearance in the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man game]], she has appeared as the central villain a recent story arc. She leades a mercenary organization known as the Wild Pack, and is skilled enough to best Peter in hand to hand combat. She had a troubled childhood, apparently ignored by her father and abused by her [[alcoholic]] mother. In reality, her father hunted [[Nazism|Nazis]], and she forgave him at his deathbed and decided to follow in his footsteps.  While she has, so far, only appeared as an antagonist to Spider-Man, she is not actually a villain so much as a bounty hunter, and she holds no particular ill-will towards Spidey. She isn't necessarily a good person either, though, as in the Spider-Man game she threatened Peter Parker's family as a means of getting Peter to work with her to control [[Venom (comics)#Ultimate Venom|Venom]]. Never having been told her real name, Spider-Man jokingly calls her "Crazy Lady" and, in the game, "Crazy Silver Hottie".

==Other media==

In other media, she has appeared in the Six Forgotten Warriors saga of the animated Spider-Man series on Fox, voiced by [[Mira Furlan]]. The Wild Pack accompanied her, and she served as both an ally and enemy to Spider-Man against both the Kingpin and the Red Skull. 

Silver Sable and her Wild Pack appeared during Spider-Man The Animated Series [[1994]], first fighting against, and then alongside [[Spider-Man]].

Silver Sable also appeared in two episodes of MTV's [[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]] in [[2003]] and was voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]]. In "Spider-Man Dis-Sabled," Spider-Man encounters Sable attempting to assassinate the mayor of [[New York City]] and a European Union Guest. As it turns out, the European Union Guest is really an undercover assassin planning to kill the president when he gets the chance. When Silver Sable discovers that Peter Parker (Spider-Man) had caught her on surveillance when she had atempted to kill the European, she attacks Peter's apartment and kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]], Harry Osbourn and Indy. Peter later discovers that Silver Sable is also posing as the mayor's assistant, but before he can stop her from kidnapping the mayor and The European, he first has to save his friends, which gives her time to get away. Spider-Man eventually catches up to her, though, and the two have a final showdown on top of the mayor's limo. It ends with the limo crashing off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. Spider-Man saves the limo before it hits the water, but Silver Sable falls off and (apparently) drowns.

Sable later made her last appearance in Mind Games: Part One in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series.  She joined [[Kraven the Hunter]] who wanted to kill Spider-Man when the super hero put the criminal in a [[Gulag]].  Sable was then caught by Spider-Man in a confrontation between Spider-Man and Kraven and Sable and she was taken to jail.  But in the process, she told Kraven "There are other ways to get revenge on Spider-Man."  Kraven used this information and killed Mary Jane Watson.  However, this appearance of Sable was fake as it was merely a  false scheme by the Gaines Twins when they hypnotized Spider-Man into thinking Kraven killed Mary Jane so Spider-Man can kill Kraven (they have grudge against Kraven when he killed their parents in the past).

Silver Sable appeared in the [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] game in [[2005]] as an assassin trying to hunt down both [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ultimate Venom|Venom]].  Apparently, in the game, Sable knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man, where as in the ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' comics, she does not.  This hints this game is not canon to these comics but in the game, when Sable was last seen, Venom whacked her across a bridge to halfway towards Central Park, knocking her unconscious.  She did not die but certainly, this would be a big enough trauma to have Sable lose half her memories, therefore, this may mean that she forgot who Spider-Man was.
