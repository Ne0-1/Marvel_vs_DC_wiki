In [[Marvel Comics]], '''Silver Sable''' (real name '''Silver Sablinovia''') is a female [[mercenary]], hunter of war criminals, the leader of the [[Wild Pack]] and CEO of Silver Sable International. Though usually regarded as a [[superhero]], her methods and motives have sometimes brought her into conflict with other superheroes.

The operations of Wild Pack and Silver Sable International drive the national economy of the fictional small European state of Symkaria. The State of [[Symkaria]] is adjacent to [[Latveria]], the nation that is ruled by [[Doctor Doom]]. Silver Sable and Victor Von Doom have an annual diplomatic dinner at Castle Doom, situated in Doomstadt. Apparently the friendship between this two states is deep-rooted and dates back to World War II.

The family of Silver Sable is composed of her father, Ernst Sablinova, her uncle Morty, and a young cousin, Anna (orphaned daughter of another, unnamed uncle or aunt). Silver was married to the Foreigner, an international assassin and the head of the 1400 Club, but they “divorced” when she discovered  his real work. Their relation today isn't completely clear, sometimes they treat one another as friends, sometimes they tolerate the presence of the other, sometimes they try to kill each other.

Silver has collaborated with various superheroes, including [[Spider-Man]], [[the Punisher]], [[Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Venom]], [[Captain America]], [[Deadpool]], and many others. [[Sandman]], a reformed Spider-Man villain was a mercenary for the Silver Sable International for a long time, heading the Intruders, the squad of superpowered mercenaries in the employ of the Silver Sable International. Other heroes and reformed minor villains work for Silver Sable International on occasion.


== '''Publication history''' ==


Silver Sable first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #265 (June 1985). After that she made occasional appearances in various Spider-Man titles, often (but not always) as an ally. On June 1992 [[Marvel Comics]] began to publish the series "Silver Sable And The Wild Pack", written by Gregory Wright and penciled by Steven Butler. This series lasted for 35 issues, until it was cancelled along with many other Marvel series in 1995. Since the series' cancellation, Silver has made occasional guest appearances in various comics.

== '''Other Media''' ==


In other media, she has appeared in several episodes of the animated Spider-Man series on Fox, voiced by [[Mira Furlan]]. The Wild Pack accompanied her, and she served as both an ally and enemy to Spider-Man against both the Kingpin and the Red Skull. 

Silver Sable also appeared in an episode of MTV's [[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]] in [[2003]] and was voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]]. In "Spider-Man Dis-Sabled," Spider-Man encounters Sable attempting to assassinate the mayor of [[New York City]] and a European Union Guest. In the end, Silver Sable fell into the ocean. Her body was never recovered.

More recently, Silver Sable has appeared in the [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] game in [[2005]] as an assassin trying to hunt down both [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom]], and will also appear in the USM comic series, taking on the same role.
