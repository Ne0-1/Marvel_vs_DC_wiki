The '''Beetle''' is the name used by multiple fictional [[character (arts)|characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is also the name of three versions of high tech armor used by seven separate characters.

==Publication history==

The Beetle debuted in the "Human Torch" segment of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) with the original incarnation [[Abner Jenkins]] using the first armor.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=22-23}}</ref> This version was beaten by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]]. The Human Torch had another tussle with the Beetle in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #21 (Jan 1965), aided by Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=28}}</ref>

This version would be used until the character switched to the second armor in ''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #59 (October 1981) (which is most associated with the name) and would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Jenkins's alter ego was changed to MACH-1. A new version debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and the second incarnation [[Leila Davis]]. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis who was still inside at the time. After Davis's death, the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. The individual names of these characters were not revealed in this initial appearance.

==Fictional character biography==

===Abner Jenkins===
[[File:Strange Tales 123.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cover to ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 which showed [[Abner Jenkins]]'s original Beetle armor (in the left). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
{{main|Abner Jenkins}}

An ex-master [[mechanic]], Abner Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the Beetle name. A defeat at the [[Fantastic Four]]'s hands sent Beetle into the direction of a life of crime where he was even a member of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Years later, Jenkins joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.

===Leila Davis===
[[Image:Thunderbolts35.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Leila Davis]]'s Beetle armor on the cover of ''Thunderbolts'' #35. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
The widow of minor [[supervillain]] [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], Leila Davis began her criminal career as a driver for the super villain [[Sinister Syndicate]] team. After Ringer's death, Leila would go on to have her own costumed career, first as Hardshell and finally as the Beetle. She was killed when [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] crushed the Beetle armor with her still inside.

Leila is introduced as the widow of the [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] (Anthony Davis). After Anthony is manipulated by [[Abner Jenkins]] into a life of crime that included multiple conflicts with [[Spider-Man]], he was shot by the anti-hero [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]]. Leila vows revenge on all three. She joins the [[Sinister Syndicate]] team led by Jenkins, in order to get close to him. She also serves as the group's [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #56 (2001)</ref>

Once Boomerang is captured by Spider-Man on the group's first mission, she began dating [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]]. Eventually, the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] engineers a breakout for Boomerang and the team fractures, with Boomerang, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and Leila (using her husband's old weapons) battling the Beetle, Speed Demon and [[Hydro-Man]] in the middle of [[New York City]].{{issue|date=November 2019}}

After attempting to kill Beetle, Leila is disarmed by Spider-Man and arrested along with Jenkins and Boomerang.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4</ref>

Sometime later, she is paroled from prison and immediately returns to her old ways. Donning a new red and black suit of weaponized armor and referring to herself as "Hardshell", she allies with Boomerang, Rhino and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. The group becomes involved in a massive fight that also involves [[Stegron]], [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], Jenkins and Spider-Man, with each party trying to gain control of an experimental gun. Spider-Man eventually stood victorious and most of the costumed criminals are taken into custody. Leila is teleported away by her husband Anthony, who had survived being shot by Scourge and had been turned into the cyborg Strikeback by the criminal organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]].<ref>''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4</ref>

She reappears years later taking on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] team (which a reformed Jenkins helped found), ironically now referring to herself as the "Beetle". She is wearing a tank-like exoskeleton painted in the same paint scheme as both of Jenkins' previous Beetle costumes—a new iteration of the Beetle armor that Jenkins himself had designed while working for the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #48</ref>

As the second Beetle, Leila eventually joins the group known as the Redeemers, which includes former members of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #50</ref> When her true identity is revealed to the rest of her teammates, she tells them that her husband Anthony died some time earlier, his body breaking down due to his cyborg enhancements.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #54</ref>

The group soon encounters the powerful super villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], and quickly into the fight he nonchalantly uses his gravity powers to crush the Beetle armor - with Leila inside - into a small cube, killing her instantly.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol.1 #56</ref>

====Powers and abilities====
As Hardshell, Leila wore a powered suit which granted her superhuman strength and durability, and a variety of weapons.

As the second Beetle, her suit possessed artificial wings which allowed her to fly while also giving her superhuman strength and durability and different weapons.

===The three Beetles===
Three college students stole the previous incarnations of the Beetle armor during Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War event]].<ref>{{Cite comic
