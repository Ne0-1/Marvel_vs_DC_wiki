The '''Beetle''' is the name used by multiple [[comic book]] [[character (arts)|characters]] owned by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is also the name of the three versions of high tech armor used by five separate characters.

==Publication history==
[[File:Strange Tales 123.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cover to ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123.<br/>Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]

The Beetle debuted in the "Human Torch" segment of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) with the original incarnation [[Abner Jenkins]] using the first armor. This version was beaten by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]]. This version would only be used for a few years before the character switched to the second armor (which is most associated with the name) and would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Jenkins's alter ego was changed to MACH-1. 

A new version debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and the second incarnation [[Leila Davis]]. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis still inside at the time.

After Davis's death, the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. How, why and exactly when the third version of the armor was rebuilt was not made clear. The individual names of these characters were not revealed.

==Fictional character biography==

===Abner Jenkins===

Years later, Jenkins joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle appeared in the 1980s Saturday morning animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', voiced by [[Christopher Collins]].

* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle made a brief appearance in the ''[[Iron Man (animated series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[John Reilly (soap opera actor)|John Reilly]] with a [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] accent that evokes the [[Beatles|similarly named band]].

* The Ultimate incarnation of Beetle appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. This version's notable trademark is the unusually large amount of fold-out rocket launchers hidden all over the surface of his armor and depicted as a highly capable criminal mercenary. In the episode "Beetle Mania", he targets [[J. Jonah Jameson]] for a campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains (form springing [[MODOK]] from prison to dealings with [[Doctor Doom]]) to which [[Spider-Man]]'s team enter the Daily Bugle to stop Beetle's assassination attempts and is eventually defeated by Spider-Man's team (although Jameson wasn't in the office but on monitor renderings the whole time unlike [[Mary Jane Watson]]). In the episode "The Attack of the Beetle", Beetle is shown having a penchant for holding grudges against Spider-Man for their pervious encounter as well as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] as they're 'sparring partners'. During his first fight with the two, Beetle decides to use [[Aunt May|May Parker]] as a hostage. While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode "Hawkeye", Beetle went to destroy the new S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] but is defeated and captured by Spider-Man and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. In the episode "The Sinister Six", Beetle appeared as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] alongside [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Along with the group, he fought Spider-Man. Beetle then fought [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] but is defeated by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] after Spider-Man's teammates switched opponents and is later detained in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. In the episode "Ultimate Venom", Beetle is hired by [[Taskmaster]] to obtain the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] symbiote, resulting in the mercenary fighting Spider-Man and then gets defeated by [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]].
