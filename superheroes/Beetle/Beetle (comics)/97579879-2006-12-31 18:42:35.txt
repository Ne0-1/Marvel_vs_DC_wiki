'''The Beetle''' is the name of two [[comic book]] characters owned by [[Marvel Comics]] and existing within the [[Marvel Universe]], as well as the name of the high tech armour worn by both characters.

There is also a group of three college students, each of whom wears one of the three versions of the Beetle armour. Their individual names have so far been unrevealed.

==Abe Jenkins==
{{main|Abner Jenkins}}
An ex-master [[mechanic]], Abe Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the name, the Beetle. A defeat at the hands of the [[Fantastic Four]] sent him into the direction of a life of crime. Years later he joined a group named the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and began a more heroic pathway in life.

==Leila Davis==
{{main|Leila Davis}}
The widow of the minor [[supervillain]] the [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], Leila began her criminal career as a henchwoman for her husband. After the Ringer's death Leila would go on to have her own costumed career, first as Hardshell, and finally as the Beetle. She was killed when [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] crushed the Beetle armour with her still inside.
 
==Depictions in other media==
The Beetle has made numerous appearances outside of comic books. Most of these happened when Abe Jenkins was the only character using the name and it is assumed that he is the character in the armor.

===Television===
The Beetle appeared in the [[1980s]] Saturday morning animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Collins]]. The Beetle stole a crime-detection computer and the Power Booster invented by Tony Stark to increase his power. He was the first villain that the Spider-Friends faced together in that origin episode.

The Beetle made a brief appearance in the ''[[Iron Man (animated series)|Iron Man]]'' [[animated series]] of the mid-[[1990s]], during the "Armor Wars" two-parter, in which he was attacked by Iron Man and had his armor - based on stolen Stark designs - deactivated. He is voiced by [[John Reilly (soap opera actor)|John Reilly]] with a [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] accent that evokes the [[Beatles|similarly-named band]].

===Video games===

* The Beetle played a minor role in the sequel to the ''[[Spider-Man (video game)|Spider-Man]]'' game for the [[PlayStation]], ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]''. He only appeared in cutscenes and did not appear as a boss character.

* In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game (released [[September 23]], [[2005]]), the Beetle makes his Ultimate continuity debut, acting as an agent for the [[Latveria]]ns, collecting genetic information from superhumans to allow them to genetically engineer super-soldiers.  The notable actions he took in the game were stealing a vial of sand from which it is implied the Ultimate [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] has a connection, freeing Norman Osborn (also known as the [[Green Goblin]]) and capturing [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] who later defeats him. He also battled Spider-Man shortly after freeing the Green Goblin, but escaped by ducking into the nearby Latverian Embassy. It is unknown whether or not there are plans to include him in the ongoing ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' comics series. He was voiced by [[Tucker Smallwood]].
