==Publication history==
[[Image:StrangeTales123.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Cover to ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123<br/>Art by [[Jack Kirby]]]]
The first version of the Beetle armor debuted in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) as the creation of [[Abner Jenkins]]. This version would only be used for a few years before the character switched to the second version, which is the armor most associated with the name. This version would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Abe Jenkins alter ego was changed to MACH-1. 

A new version of the Beetle armor debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and [[Leila Davis]], the second person to use the Beetle identity. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis, who was still inside at the time.

After Leila Davis' death the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. How, why and exactly when the third version of the armor was rebuilt was not made clear. The individual names of these characters were not revealed.

==In other media==
The Beetle has made numerous appearances outside of comic books. Most of these happened when Abe Jenkins was the only character using the name and it is assumed that he is the character in the armor.

===Television===
The Beetle appeared in the [[1980s]] Saturday morning animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Collins]]. The Beetle stole a crime-detection computer and the Power Booster invented by Tony Stark to increase his power. He was the first villain that the Spider-Friends faced together in that origin episode.

The Beetle made a brief appearance in the ''[[Iron Man (animated series)|Iron Man]]'' [[animated series]] of the mid-[[1990s]], during the "[[Armor Wars]]" two-parter, in which he was attacked by Iron Man and had his armor - based on stolen Stark designs - deactivated. He is voiced by [[John Reilly (soap opera actor)|John Reilly]] with a [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] accent that evokes the [[Beatles|similarly-named band]].

Beetle will soon appear in [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]], he will be voiced by [[Dave Wittenberg]].
