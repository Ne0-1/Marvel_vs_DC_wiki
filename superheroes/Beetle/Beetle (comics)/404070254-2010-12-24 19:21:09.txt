'''The Beetle''' is the name of two [[comic book]] characters owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who exist within the [[fiction]]al [[Marvel Universe]]. It is also the name of the three versions of high tech armor used by five separate characters.

==Publication history==
[[File:Strange Tales 123.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cover to ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123.<br/>Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]

The first version of the Beetle armor debuted in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) as the creation of [[Abner Jenkins]]. This version would only be used for a few years before the character switched to the second version, which is the armor most associated with the name. This version would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Abe Jenkins alter ego was changed to MACH-1. 

A new version of the Beetle armor debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and [[Leila Davis]], the second person to use the Beetle identity. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis, who was still inside at the time.

After Leila Davis' death the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. How, why and exactly when the third version of the armor was rebuilt was not made clear. The individual names of these characters were not revealed.

==Fictional character biography==
===Abner Jenkins===
{{main|Abner Jenkins}}

An ex-master [[mechanic]], Abe Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the name, the Beetle. A defeat at the hands of the [[Fantastic Four]] sent him into the direction of a life of crime. Years later he joined a group named the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.

===Leila Davis===

The widow of the minor [[supervillain]] the [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], Leila began her criminal career as a driver for the super villain team the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. After the Ringer's death Leila would go on to have her own costumed career, first as Hardshell, and finally as the Beetle. She was killed when [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] crushed the Beetle armor with her still inside.

===Ultimate Beetle===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Beetle debuts in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #124. Spider-Man first finds him robbing a sample of the Venom symbiote from the Roxxon company.

Upon cornering Beetle, Venom is attacked by Spider-Man. When Venom seizes Beetle with his tentacles, Spider-Man saves Beetle who escapes. After Eddie Brock becomes Venom again, Beetle captures him and ships him to Latveria.<ref>{{Cite comic

==In other media==
The Beetle has made numerous appearances outside of comic books. Most of these happened when [[Abner Jenkins]] was the only character using the name and it is assumed that he is the character in the armor.

===Television===
* The Beetle appeared in the 1980s Saturday morning animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Collins]]. The Beetle stole a crime-detection computer and the Power Booster invented by Tony Stark to increase his power. He was the first villain that the Spider-Friends faced together in that origin episode.

* The Beetle made a brief appearance in the ''[[Iron Man (animated series)|Iron Man]]'' [[animated series]] of the mid-1990s, during the "[[Armor Wars]]" two-parter, in which he was attacked by Iron Man and had his armor - based on stolen Stark designs - deactivated. He is voiced by [[John Reilly (soap opera actor)|John Reilly]] with a [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] accent that evokes the [[Beatles|similarly-named band]].

===Video games===
[[File:Ultimate Beetle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Beetle in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game]]
* Beetle appears in both the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] games based on the animated series.

* The Beetle was the first boss in the 1995 Super Nintendo game ''[[Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'', a game only released in Japan.

* The Beetle played a minor role in the sequel to the ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' game for the [[PlayStation]], ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]''. He only appeared in cut-scenes and did not appear as a boss character.

* In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man video game]]'' the Beetle (voiced by [[Tucker Smallwood]]) makes his Ultimate continuity debut, acting as an agent for the [[Latveria]]ns, collecting genetic information from superhumans to allow them to genetically engineer super-soldiers. The notable actions he took in the game were stealing a vial of sand (which it is implied the Ultimate [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] has a connection) and freeing Norman Osborn (also known as the [[Green Goblin]]). He also battled Spider-Man shortly after freeing the Green Goblin, but escaped by ducking into the nearby Latverian Embassy. Concept art in the special edition of the game shows Beetle giving the Sandman vial to Doctor Doom. Beetle is later sent to capture a sample of the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]. Venom eventually chases and defeats the Beetle.
