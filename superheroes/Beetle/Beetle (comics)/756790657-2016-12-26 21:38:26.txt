The '''Beetle''' is the name used by multiple fictional [[character (arts)|characters]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is also the name of the three versions of high tech armor used by seven separate characters.

==Publication history==
[[File:Strange Tales 123.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cover to ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123.<br/>Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]

The Beetle debuted in the "Human Torch" segment of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #123 (August 1964) with the original incarnation [[Abner Jenkins]] using the first armor. This version was beaten by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]]. This version would only be used for a few years before the character switched to the second armor (which is most associated with the name) and would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Jenkins's alter ego was changed to MACH-1. A new version debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and the second incarnation [[Leila Davis]]. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis who was still inside at the time. After Davis's death, the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. How, why and exactly when the third version of the armor was rebuilt was not made clear. The individual names of these characters were not revealed.

==Fictional character biography==

===Abner Jenkins===
{{main|Abner Jenkins}}

An ex-master [[mechanic]], Abner Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the Beetle name. A defeat at the [[Fantastic Four]]'s hands sent Beetle into the direction of a life of crime where he was even a member of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Years later, Jenkins joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.

===Leila Davis===

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle appeared in the 1980s Saturday morning animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', voiced by [[Christopher Collins]].
* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle made a brief appearance in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[John Reilly (actor)|John Reilly]] with a [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] accent that evokes the [[Beatles|similarly named band]]. Beetle attempts to steal a gold statue only for Iron Man to crush Beetle under a giant shoe sculpture and short circuit Beetle's armor with a negative inhibitor pack.
* The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of Beetle appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. This version is depicted as a highly capable criminal mercenary that rarely says anything and his notable trademark is the unusually large amount of fold-out rocket launchers hidden all over the surface of his armor. In the episode "Beetle Mania", he targets the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' for [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains (i.e. springing [[MODOK]] from prison and dealings with Doctor Doom). When he fights the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees]], Beetle's assassination attempt is stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and is knocked out by [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], however, Jameson was on monitor renderings the whole time unlike [[Mary Jane Watson]] actually being in the office. In the episode "The Attack of the Beetle", Beetle is shown having a penchant for holding grudges against Spider-Man for their previous encounter as well as [[Phil Coulson]] for being 'sparring partners'. During his first fight with the two, Beetle decides to use [[Aunt May|May Parker]] as a hostage. While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode "Hawkeye", Beetle went to destroy the new [[Helicarrier|S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier]] but is defeated and captured by Spider-Man and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. In the episode "The Sinister Six", Beetle appeared as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] alongside [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Kraven the Hunter]] and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Along with the group, he fought Spider-Man. When the trainees arrive, Beetle fights with [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] but is defeated by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] after Spider-Man's teammates switch opponents and is later detained in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. In the episode "Agent Venom", Beetle is hired by [[Taskmaster]] to obtain a sample of the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] symbiote. Failing with the Venomized Scorpion, he chases after [[Flash Thompson]], ignoring [[Harry Osborn]] and Mary Jane in the process. Beetle subsequently had to fight with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom. While Spider-Man deals with Taskmaster, Beetle is eventually defeated by Agent Venom. In the episode "New Warriors", Beetle is among the escaped supervillains along with Doctor Octopus, the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and the Green Goblin during a showdown between Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] and the [[New Warriors]]. Along with his fellow supervillains, Beetle is eventually defeated by the New Warriors. In the episode "Contest of Champions" [Pt. 1], Beetle - alongside the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] - are sent by [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to obtain Spider-Man for the contest against the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. In the episode "Anti-Venom", Beetle attempts to steal a truck only to be attacked by Spider-Man and Agent Venom, who had been previously defeating possible recruits of Doctor Octopus's New Sinister Six. However, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] agents had previously upgraded Beetle's armor, allowing him to beat the duo until the Patrioteer hacks Beetle's armor and sends Beetle crashing into the pavement.
