'''Star-Lord''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s that appear in publications published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

The first Star-Lord to chronologically appear is '''Peter Quill''', first appears in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan. 1976), and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and Steve Gan. The second version, '''Jason of Spartax''', is in fact the father of Peter Quill and appears in a [[flashback]] tale in the [[limited series]] titled ''[[Inhumans]]'' vol. 3, #1 - 3 (June - Aug. 2000) and #4 (Oct. 2000) and was created by [[Carlos Pacheco]] and [[Jose Ladronn]]. The third and final version is '''Sinjin Quarrell''', and first appears in the limited series ''Starlord'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1996 - Feb. 1997), being created by [[Timothy Zahn]] and various artists. 

== Publication history ==
The character first appears in the [[magazine]] publication ''[[Marvel Preview]]'', with creator [[Steve Englehart]] stating on his [[website]]: 

{{blockquote|I conceived something very large. My hero would go from being an unpleasant, introverted jerk to the most cosmic being in the universe, and I would tie it into my then-new interest in [[astrology]]. After his earthbound beginning, his mind would be opened step by step, with a fast-action story on Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war story on Mars, and so on out to the edge of the solar system, and then beyond.

But — after his earthbound beginning, where I established him as an unpleasant, introverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one ever saw what he was to become.<ref>[http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html Star-Lord]</ref>}}

The title establishes that Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical [[phenomenon]] when many of the [[planet]]s  align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's father angrily accused his wife Meredith of [[infidelity]] and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden [[heart attack]]. Quill is raised by his single mother until she is killed by an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. The character is placed in an [[orphanage]] but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. An alien entity called the ''Master of the Sun'' eventually visits the [[space station]] that Quill and other astronauts are currently inhabiting, and offers the mantle of ''Star Lord'' (an interplanetary [[policeman]]) to a worthy candidate, Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favour of a colleague he once treated badly. 

Quill is outraged, and NASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. The character, however, steals a scoutship, and on returning to the space station takes his colleague's place. Quill is then chosen to become Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an [[illusion]] in which the character is able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called "Ship", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #4 (Jan. 1976)</ref>

Star-Lord reappeared in ''Marvel Preview'', with writer [[Chris Claremont]] revamping the character and using science fiction adventure stories like the [[Heinlein juveniles]] for inspiration.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #11 (Summer 1977)</ref> Heinlein's [[lawyer]]s threatened legal action over the cover, which featured a blurb that described the content as "a novel-length science fiction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein," leading to the issue being pulled and reprinted.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/02/12/comic-book-legends-revealed-194/ ''Comic Book Legends Revealed'' #194], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 12, 2009</ref> Star-Lord continued to make sporadic appearances in the titles ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'';<ref>''Marvel Super Special'' #10 (Winter 1979)</ref> ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]''<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' vol. 2, #6 - 7 (May - July 1980)</ref> and ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'';<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #61 (Aug. 1981)</ref> eventually featuring in a self-titled limited series, that featured another character - Sinjin Quarrell - taking on the identity.<ref>''Star-Lord'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1996 – Feb. 1997)</ref> 

The third ''[[Inhumans]]'' limited series reveals that Peter Quill's father is '''Jason of Spartax''', the second son of the galactic [[Emperor]] who acted as Star-Lord before him.<ref>''Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1 - 3 (June - Aug. 2000) and #4 (Oct. 2000)</ref>

Peter Quill is used by writer [[Keith Giffen]] in a storyline for the title in the shortlived ''[[Thanos]]'' series. The character encounters the former [[Herald of Galactus]] the [[Fallen One]] and is almost killed defeating the entity (Star-Lord's vessel "Ship" is destroyed in the conflict). The pair are subsequently imprisoned in the intergalactic prison the [[Kyln]].<ref>''Thanos'' #8 - 12 (May - Sep. 2004)</ref> Star-Lord is freed by the hero ''[[Nova (comics)|Nova]]' during the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' storyline and aids in the war against villain ''[[Annihilus]].<ref>''Annihilation'' #1 - 6 (Oct. 2006 - Mar. 2007)</ref> The character also features in the sequel ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'', acting as military adviser to the [[Kree]] [[general]] [[Ronan the Accuser]] against the invading alien race the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].<ref>''Annihilation Conquest'' #1 - 6 (Jan. - June 2008)</ref> 
When the Kree homeworld of [[Hala]] is conquered by the Phalanx, a related self-titled limited series details Star-Lord's efforts to lead a band of rebels against the invaders until the war is over.<ref>''Annihilation Conquest: Starlord'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2007)</ref> In the second volume of a self-titled series, Star-Lord becomes the leader of a new version of the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', deciding to be "proactive" and end emerging galactic threats.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #1 (July 2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. The character also uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the [[four elements]] (air, earth, fire and water). Star-Lord also shares a [[psychic]] link with his [[sentient]] space vessel, "Ship".
