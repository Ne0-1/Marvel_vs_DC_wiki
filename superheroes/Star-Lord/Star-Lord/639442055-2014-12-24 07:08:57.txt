{{Cosmic Marvel}}
'''Star-Lord''' ('''Peter Jason Quill''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Steve Englehart]] and Steve Gan, the character first appeared in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan. 1976). The son of a human mother and alien father, Quill assumes the mantle of Star-Lord, an interplanetary policeman.

The character played a role in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] comic book events ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' (2006) and ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' (2007), and became the leader of the [[outer space|space]]-based superhero team [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the 2008 relaunch of the comic of the same name. He has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, and [[trading card]]s. [[Chris Pratt]] portrays Peter Quill as the lead character in the 2014 live-action film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.

== Publication history ==
The character first appeared in the black-and-white magazine publication ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan 1976). Creator [[Steve Englehart]] had plans for the character that went unrealized. He later reflected on his website:

{{blockquote|I conceived something very large. My hero would go from being an unpleasant, introverted jerk to the most cosmic being in the universe, and I would tie it into my then-new interest in [[astrology]]. After his earthbound beginning, his mind would be opened step by step, with a fast-action story on Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war story on Mars, and so on out to the edge of the solar system, and then beyond.

But – after his earthbound beginning, where I established him as an unpleasant, introverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one ever saw what he was to become.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html|title= Star-Lord|first= Steve|last= Englehart|authorlink= Steve Englehart|date= n.d.|publisher= SteveEnglehart.com|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6S3yl1d9A|archivedate= August 24, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= December 26, 2010}}</ref>}}

Star-Lord continued to appear in ''Marvel Preview'', with writer [[Chris Claremont]] revamping the character and using science fiction adventure stories like the [[Heinlein juveniles]] for inspiration.<ref name="MP11">{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]|penciller= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|inker= [[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]]|story= Star-Lord|title= [[Marvel Preview]]|issue= 11|date= Summer 1977}}</ref> Heinlein's lawyers threatened legal action over the cover to ''Marvel Preview'' #11, which featured a blurb that described the content as "a novel-length science fiction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A.

The character returned in ''[[Thanos]]'' #8–12 (May–Sept. 2004) and ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (2006). The following year, he received a four issue eponymous title (''Annihilation: Conquest{{spaced ndash}}Star-Lord'') leading into the "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]" crossover storyline, in which he played a central role. Spinning out of "Annihilation: Conquest", a second volume of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' featured a team of characters from the crossover who were led by Star-Lord for the duration of the title's 25-issue run. Plot lines from that series were concluded in the ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' mini-series.

Star-Lord returned, along with other members of the Guardians, in ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'' #4-8 (June–Oct. 2012). He stars in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3, a part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|title= NYCC: Bendis, McNiven & Wacker Relaunch the ''Guardians of the Galaxy''|last= Richards|first= Dave|date= October 14, 2012 |publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131606180500/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|archivedate= December 6, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate =October 15, 2012}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical phenomenon when many of the planets align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's father accuses his wife Meredith of infidelity and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden heart attack. Quill is raised by his single mother until she is killed by an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] when he is eleven.<ref name="MP4" /> Quill is placed in an orphanage but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee NASA astronaut. An alien entity called the Master of the Sun later visits the space station that Quill and other astronauts are inhabiting, and offers the mantle of Star-Lord (an interplanetary policeman) to a worthy candidate. Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favor of a colleague he once treated badly. Quill is outraged, and NASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. Instead, he steals a scout ship, returns to the space station, and takes his colleague's place. Quill becomes Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which the character is able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called "Ship", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord.<ref name="MP4" /><ref name="AHMU">{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starlor1.htm|title= Star-Lord (Peter Quill)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= March 7, 2014|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6S409BOlX|archivedate= August 24, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref>

Years later, Star-Lord becomes involved in stopping a group of slavers who are destroying worlds. His efforts led him to discover a conspiracy to replace the emperor of the Spartoi Empire with his uncle, Prince Gareth. In order to thwart the takeover, Star-Lord travels to the imperial throneworld Sparta where he encounters and kills the alien who killed his mother. Star-Lord then meets Emperor Jason who reveals that he is Peter's father. Jason explains that he had crashed on Earth decades earlier and been rescued by Meredith Quill. During the year that he had spent repairing his ship, Jason and Meredith fell in love. When it came time to leave, Jason, for Meredith's safety, had placed a mindlock on her memories of him, causing her to remember their year together as only a dream.<ref name="MP11" /><ref name="AHMU" />

This origin was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] and the astronomical phenomena and murderous not-father were removed. Instead, [[J'son of Spartax]] - an alien with a human appearance - crashes on Earth and strikes up a relationship with Meredith. A short time later, he leaves Meredith pregnant with his child and with his gun for safekeeping. Ten years later, Meredith is killed by members of the alien race known as the [[Badoon]]. Peter kills both assassins with a single shotgun blast, then finds the alien gun in his mother's closet. Realizing that the alien ship is about to attack, Peter gets out of the house just before it is destroyed. Believing that they have killed their target, the alien ship leaves. After being found by the authorities, who believe the Quill house was destroyed by a gas leak explosion, Peter is taken to a hospital where a nurse brings him the only thing that survived the explosion, his "space toy", which is J'son's gun.<ref name="GotGPointOne" />

The character encounters the former [[Herald of Galactus]], the [[Fallen One]], and is almost killed defeating the entity, and in addition Star-Lord's vessel "Ship" is destroyed in the conflict. The pair are subsequently imprisoned in the intergalactic prison the [[Kyln]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|penciller= [[Ron Lim|Lim, Ron]]|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= Dark Alliances|title= [[Thanos]]|issue= 8|date= May 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Divine Madness|title= Thanos|issue= 9|date= June 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|title= Thanos|issue= 10|date= July 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= The Fallen|title= Thanos|issue= 11|date= August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Lim, Ron|inker= Milgrom, Al|story= Crescendo|title= Thanos|issue= 12|date= September 2004}}</ref>  Star-Lord is freed by the hero [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] during the "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]]" storyline and aids in the war against villain [[Annihilus]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Andrea Di Vito|Di Vito, Andrea]]|inker= Di Vito, Andrea|story= Blood and Thunder|title= [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]|issue= 1|date= October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Di Vito, Andrea|inker= Di Vito, Andrea|story= Nice Try, Drax|title= Annihilation|issue= 2|date= November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Di Vito, Andrea|inker= Di Vito, Andrea|story= Desperate Measures|title= Annihilation|issue= 3|date= December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Di Vito, Andrea|inker= Di Vito, Andrea|story= Revelation|title= Annihilation|issue= 4|date= January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Di Vito, Andrea|inker= Di Vito, Andrea|story= Ascension|title= Annihilation|issue= 5|date= February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Di Vito, Andrea|inker= Di Vito, Andrea|story= Finale|title= Annihilation|issue= 6|date= March 2007}}</ref> Quill later acts as military adviser to the [[Kree]] [[general]] [[Ronan the Accuser]].

=== Thanos and the Cancerverse ===

"They Will Not Be Forgotten"
Once again in Project PEGASUS, Nova was faced with a doppelganger Quasar from a twisted reality dubbed the Cancerverse within the Fault who attempted to assist his brethren in invading the "prime reality" through a gateway found in the institution. Nova shut down the gateway and pursued the fake Quasar into space where a massive war was already in progress between the forces of the "prime reality" and that of the Cancerverse. The mad titan Thanos had been previously resurrected and was thought to be the only hope to defeat the Cancerverse, so he and the Guardians of the Galaxy went into the Fault to find a way to defeat the invading reality. Nova soon followed after rescuing a kidnapped Namorita from the Revengers – a distorted version of the Avengers. He assisted Star-Lord in detaining an enraged Thanos from escaping back into the "prime reality" with the intention of destroying everything after Mistress Death again rejected him, even after Thanos eradicated an entire reality for her. Nova remained with Star-Lord until the Cancerverse imploded and the Fault was sealed in the process, seemingly killing them all.

Despite this, he later reappears with a new Guardians line-up on Earth to aid the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] against the returned Thanos.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Mark Bagley|Bagley, Mark]]|inker= Miki, Danny|story= Hear me, Zodiac|title= [[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]|issue= 3|date= July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Miki, Danny|story= Thanos, I am Thor, son of Odin, prince of Asgard|title= Avengers Assemble|issue= 4|date= August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Miki, Danny|story= Great job, Quill!|title= Avengers Assemble|issue= 5|date= September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Miki, Danny|story= Uh, excuse me, Avengers?|title= Avengers Assemble|issue= 6|date= October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Miki, Danny|story= I know your type hates surprises, so you'll forgive the intrusion...|title= Avengers Assemble|issue= 7|date= November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Bagley, Mark|inker= Miki, Danny|story= Okay...

==Powers and abilities==
Star-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert in close-quarter combat, various human and alien firearms, and battle techniques. He has extensive knowledge of various alien customs, societies, and cultures, and considerable knowledge about cosmic abstracts, such as [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]].

As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. The character uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the [[Classical element|four elements]] (air, earth, fire and water). Star-Lord shares a [[psychic]] link with his [[sentient]] space vessel, "Ship".

"Ship" is actually a sentient energy form. She most often exists in the form of a starship, but can alter her structure at will. She can travel through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional starship accessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced [[sensors]], replicators (able to form any kind of food, drink, etc.), and [[hologram projectors]]. She has proven capable of creating a human form, which she can then animate and use as a host. Even if completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her true form is her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct for those she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including love for her partners.

"Ship" can create Widgets—small, mobile droids able to scout out situations, gather information, and then return to her. The full extent of "Ship's" abilities are unknown.

During Star-Lord's battle with The Fallen One, his Element Gun, suit and "Ship" were destroyed. Due to severe injury he was grafted with cybernetic implants by doctors on the Kyln, where he was sentenced. The eye implant allows him to see all energy spectra and the memory chip in his brain gives him 100% total recall.

On the Kree world of Aladon Prime, Star-Lord's cybernetic implants were removed. Star-Lord was outfitted with a Kree-issued heat-dampening espionage battle-suit, which became the hallmark look for the Guardians of the Galaxy, a battle helmet, and a universal translator, all of which he still uses. His battle helmet can analyze strategy data, improve vision, and regulate oxygen in space.

Star-Lord's chosen weapons are two Kree sub-machine guns with various types of ammunition, including explosives.

==Other characters named Star-Lord==
A three-issue limited series, titled ''Starlord'', featured a man named Sinjin Quarrel adopting the identity 12 years after the disappearance of the original Star-Lord (Quill).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starlor2.htm|title= Starlord (Sinjin Quarrel)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= September 18, 2002|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130308195843/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starlor2.htm|archivedate= March 8, 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> The series, published from December 1996 to February 1997, was written by [[Timothy Zahn]], with art by Dan Lawlis.<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 13430|title= ''Starlord''}}</ref> Where the events depicted in this miniseries fit into Peter Quill's chronology has never been revealed.
