'''Star-Lord''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comics]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first Star-Lord (Peter Quill) debuted in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (January [[1976 in comics|1976]]) and was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist [[Steve Gan]]. 

== Publication history ==
The character's origin is related in ''Marvel Preview'' #4 Jan. 1976 and ''Marvel Preview'' #11, Summer 1977, with later appearances in ''Marvel Super Special'' #10 (Winter 1979); ''Marvel Spotlight'' #6-7 (May - July 1980), and ''Starlord Special Edition'' (Feb. 1982).  In 1996 - 1997, the character makes a brief appearance in the three-part (Dec. - Feb) ''Star-Lord'' limited series. Starlord has a major role in the 2006-2007 ''Annihilation'' series, and becomes leader of the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], which began in April 2008.

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Quill was born during an unusual astronomical phenomenon when many of the planets aligned. On the night of his birth, the man who thought he was Peter's father angrily accused his wife of infidelity, claiming the baby resembled neither of them (although [[Steve Gan]]'s artwork included a strong facial resemblance between this man and the adult Peter).  He attempted to kill the infant, but died of a sudden heart attack. Quill was then raised by his single mother until the age of eleven, when she was killed by an alien. He was then placed in an orphanage but ran away and eventually became a trainee [[astronaut]]. 

Quill's conduct towards a colleague he saved in an accident, however, hindered his progress. When an alien force contacted Earth and offered the mantle of Star-Lord to a worthy candidate, Quill volunteered, but the role was assigned to the same colleague Quill had once saved. This angered Quill who stunned his colleague and attempted to take the role for himself. Quill is then teleported away by an alien entity called the Master of the Sun, who via an illusion allows him to take vengeance on the alien that killed his mother. Quill is then able to truly become Star-Lord. <ref>''Marvel Preview'' #4 Jan. 1976</ref>

It is later revealed (by a completely different creative team who ignored the art of the first story, as well as writer [[Steve Englehart]]'s astrological elements) that Quill's true father is Jason of Spartax, the young son of the galactic Emperor who acted as Star-Lord before him.  Years before, his father had crash-landed on Earth and loved Peter's mother, subsequently wiping her mind of the encounter afterwards. Peter's mother then married her childhood sweetheart. As Star-Lord, Quill later discovers the alien that killed his mother was sent by his father's brother, who intended to [[usurp]] the throne. Star-Lord finds and kills both the alien murderer and his uncle, and then reunites briefly with his father, now the Emperor. Star-Lord acquires a sentient spacecraft called "Ship" and then leaves to explore the universe. <ref>''Marvel Preview'' #11, Summer 1977</ref>

Years later, Star-Lord does battle with the [[Fallen One]], the rogue [[Herald of Galactus]]. He is almost killed in the encounter, and eventually recovers and uses the residual energies from recently deceased souls to defeat the Fallen One, at the cost of Ship. After the battle, both Star-Lord and the Fallen One are taken to the [[Kyln]], an intergalactic maximum security prison. <ref>''Annihilation: Star-Lord'' #1 - 4 (2007)</ref> During the events of the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]], Star-Lord serves as the second-in-command to the superhero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]], who leads the resistance group the United Front against the forces of the villain [[Annihilus]]. <ref>''Annihilation'' #1 - 6 (2006); ''Annihilation: Star-Lord'' #1 - 4 (2007)and ''Annihilation:Conquest'' #1 - 6 (2007 - 2008)</ref>

Starlord later becomes the leader of the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. <ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156349 Greeting the Guardians: Star-Lord], [[Newsarama]], May 8, 2008</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. He also uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the four elements (air, earth, fire and water). Star-Lord was also psychically linked to his vessel, Ship.
