'''Star-Lord''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s that appear in publications from by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

The first Star-Lord was '''Peter Quill''', who first appeared in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan. 1976), and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and Steve Gan. The second version, '''Jason of Spartax''', was the father of Peter Quill and appeared in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] tale in the [[limited series]] titled ''[[Inhumans]]'' vol. 3, #1 - 3 (June - Aug. 2000) and #4 (Oct. 2000). He was created by [[Carlos Pacheco]] and [[Jose Ladronn]]. The third version, '''Sinjin Quarrell''', was created by [[Timothy Zahn]] and debuted in the limited series ''Star-Lord'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1996 - Feb. 1997). 

== Publication history ==
The character first appeared in the [[magazine]] publication ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan 1976).  Creator [[Steve Englehart]] had plans for the character that went unrealized, however, later reflecting on his [[website]]: 

{{blockquote|I conceived something very large. My hero would go from being an unpleasant, introverted jerk to the most cosmic being in the universe, and I would tie it into my then-new interest in [[astrology]]. After his earthbound beginning, his mind would be opened step by step, with a fast-action story on Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war story on Mars, and so on out to the edge of the solar system, and then beyond.

But — after his earthbound beginning, where I established him as an unpleasant, introverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one ever saw what he was to become.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html |title=Star-Lord |publisher=Steveenglehart.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref>}}

Star-Lord reappeared in ''Marvel Preview'', with writer [[Chris Claremont]] revamping the character and using science fiction adventure stories like the [[Heinlein juveniles]] for inspiration.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #11 (Summer 1977)</ref> Heinlein's lawyers threatened legal action over the cover, which featured a blurb that described the content as "a novel-length science fiction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein," leading to the issue being pulled and reprinted.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/02/12/comic-book-legends-revealed-194/ ''Comic Book Legends Revealed'' #194], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 12, 2009</ref> Star-Lord made sporadic appearances over the next few years in the titles ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'' <ref>''Marvel Super Special'' #10 (Winter 1979)</ref>, ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]''<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' vol. 2, #6 - 7 (May - July 1980)</ref>, and ''[[Marvel Premiere]]''<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #61 (Aug. 1981)</ref>.

Much later, a self-titled limited series was set in the future and featured another character - Sinjin Quarrell - taking on the identity.<ref>''Star-Lord'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1996 – Feb. 1997)</ref>  ''Inhumans'' vol. 3 (2000) introduced a third version of the character, in flashbacks featuring Peter Quill's father, who also used the name "Star-Lord."

The original Star-Lord returned in ''[[Thanos]]'' #8-12 (May - Sept 2004) and ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (2006).  The following year, he received a four issue eponymous title (''Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord'') leading into the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' crossover event, in which he played a central role.  Spinning out of ''Annihilation: Conquest'', a second volume of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' featured a team of characters from the crossover who were led by Star-Lord for the duration of the title's 25-issue run.  Plot lines from that series were concluded in the ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' mini-series.

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical phenomenon when many of the planets  align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's father accuses his wife Meredith of infidelity and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden heart attack. Quill is raised by his single mother until she is killed by an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. Quill is placed in an orphanage but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee NASA astronaut. An alien entity called the ''Master of the Sun'' eventually visits the space station that Quill and other astronauts are inhabiting, and offers the mantle of ''Star-Lord'' (an interplanetary policeman) to a worthy candidate. Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favor of a colleague he once treated badly. 

Quill is outraged, and NASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. Instead, he steals a scoutship, returns to the space station, and takes his colleague's place. Quill becomes Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which the character is able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called "Ship", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #4 (Jan. 1976)</ref>

The character encounters the former [[Herald of Galactus]] the [[Fallen One]] and is almost killed defeating the entity (Star-Lord's vessel "Ship" is destroyed in the conflict). The pair are subsequently imprisoned in the intergalactic prison the [[Kyln]].<ref>''Thanos'' #8 - 12 (May - Sep. 2004)</ref> Star-Lord is freed by the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] during the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]]'' and aids in the war against villain [[Annihilus]].<ref>''Annihilation'' #1 - 6 (Oct. 2006 - Mar. 2007)</ref> Quill later acts as military adviser to the [[Kree]] [[general]] [[Ronan the Accuser]] against the invading alien race the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].<ref>''Annihilation Conquest'' #1 - 6 (Jan. - June 2008)</ref> 

When the Kree homeworld of [[Hala (comics)|Hala]] is conquered by the Phalanx, Star-Lord leads a band of rebels against the invaders until the war is over.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2007)</ref> In an effort to prevent another interstellar war, Star-Lord forms a new version of the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. They are "proactive" and try to end emerging galactic threats early.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #1 (July 2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Star-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert in CQC (Closed Quarter Combat), various human and alien firearms, battle techniques and has an has extensive knowledge on various alien customs, societies and cultures, as well as various knowledge about cosmic abstracts such as [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]].

As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. The character also uses an "Element Gun", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the [[Classical element|four elements]] (air, earth, fire and water). Star-Lord also shares a [[psychic]] link with his [[sentient]] space vessel, "[[Ship]]".

The Ship is actually a Sentient energy form. She most often exists in the form of a starship, but can alter her structure at will. She can travel through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional starship accessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced [[sensors]], replicators (able to form any kind of food, drink, etc.), and [[hologram projectors]]. She has proven capable of creating a human form, which she can then animate and use as a host. Even if completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her true form is her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct for those she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including love for her partners.

Ship can create Widgets--small, mobile droids able to scout out situations, gather information, and then return to her. The full extent of Ship's abilities are unknown.

During Star-Lord's battle with The Fallen One, his Elemental Gun, suit and Ship were destroyed. Due to severe injury he was grafted with cybernetic implants by doctors on the Kyln, where he was sentenced. The eye implant allows him to see all energy spectrums and the memory chip in his brain gives him 100% recall.

On the Kree world of Aladon Prime Star-Lord's cybernetic implants were removed. Star-lord was outfitted with a Kree issued heat-dampening-espionage-battle suit, which became the hallmark look for the Guardians of the Galaxy, battle helmet and a universal translator, all of which he still uses. His battle helmet analyses strategy data, can improve vision and regulate oxygen when in space. 

Star-Lord's chosen weapons are two Kree sub-machine guns with various types of ammunition, including explosives.
