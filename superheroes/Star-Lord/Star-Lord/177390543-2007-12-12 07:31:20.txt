'''Star-Lord''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Peter Quill, the first Star-Lord to appear, debuted in ''Marvel Preview'' #4 (January 1976). He was created by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and artist Steve Gan.  

Jason of Spartax, Peter's father, was first seen in ''Marvel Preview'' #11 (January 1977). He was created by writer [[Christopher Claremont|Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Byrne]]. Jason later re-appeared in Inhumans vol. 4 #2-4.  Though he was never called Star-Lord, he was seen to wear a similar uniform and was accompanied by the sentient craft called Ship.

Sinjin Quarrell, a third Star-Lord from an unnamed future, first appeared in ''Star-Lord'' #1 (December 1996).  He was created by [[Timothy Zahn]] and Dan Lawlis.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Starlordmu0.png|thumb|left|150px|Star Lord from Marvel Preview #4 (January 1976), artist [[Gray Morrow]]]] 
Peter Jason Quill was born [[February 4th]], [[1962]], during an unusual astronomical phenomenon where Jupiter, Mars, The Sun, Mercury, Venus and The Moon aligned in formation.  On the night of his birth, the man who thought he was Peter's father angrily accused his wife of infidelity, as the baby resembled neither of them.  He attempted to kill the infant Peter with an axe, but was struck down by a heart attack, leaving the child to stare for over an hour into a starry sky.  

With that imprinted on his consciousness, Peter was raised by his single mother until the age of eleven, when he found that local rumors of UFOs were, in fact, true.  Taking his disbelieving mother to the landing site, he was horrified to see her shot down by the aliens and vowed his eternal revenge.  The local authorities chalked his story up to trauma, and young Peter soon ran away from the orphanage in which they placed him.  

Growing up alone, Quill managed through force of will to become an astronaut candidate, but his complete and utter disdain for the universe kept him from making any close bonds, and turned potential friends into enemies.  When Harrelson, a fellow astronaut was trapped in a malfunctioning training device, Peter quickly saved him, only to berate the man for his stupidity in being trapped in the first place.

The introverted Quill was thus overlooked for a prestigious Martian mission, in favor of the astronaut he saved, who had better people skills.  Peter made a conscious attempt to better his people skills, and was able to secure shorter, less important missions for himself.  When a mysterious force contacted Earth, offering to pass the mantle of Star-Lord to a worthy candidate, Peter volunteered, but was shot down in favor of a more experienced candidate: his old adversary Harrelson.  Peter Quill reacted with anger and violence, and was dismissed from service, only to sneak back into the facility, shoot Harrelson with a stun ray and try to take the mission for himself.  As he was about to be incinerated by guards, he was teleported away by an alien called The Master of The Sun (who resembled the Christian deity).  Quill was offered power, and immediately used it to destroy the aliens who so long ago killed his mother.  The Master of Sun immediately reappeared, revealing that his vengeance was only an illusion, but Star-Lord's lust for vengeance was satisfied, and Peter Quill let go of his hatred and accepted his destiny. <ref>''Marvel Preview #4, January 1976</ref>

Later stories revealed that Peter's father was correct, as his true father was Jason of Spartax, the young son of the galactic Emperor who acted as Star-Lord before him.  Jason had crash-landed on Earth years before and fathered the child before repairing his ship and returning home to an urgent distress call.  He had wiped the woman's memory upon leaving, and returned to find her married to a childhood sweetheart, and chose not to interfere.  It was revealed that the alien who killed Meredith Quill was actually a bodyguard sent by Jason's uncle to wipe out young Peter, the heir to the Galactic Throne.  Peter killed both the alien and the uncle who had intended to overthrow his father, but chose not to stay with his newfound parent, instead wandering the stars with his sentient starcraft, Ship. <ref>''Marvel Preview #11, Summer 1977</ref>

It was recently revealed that Starlord attempted to engage the rogue [[Herald of Galactus]], the [[Fallen One]], but he was defeated and almost killed. After several months of recovery, Peter and Ship discovered the Fallen One had a particular weakness, the energy of the recently deceased. Sacrificing an entire planet, Starlord harvested these energies and focused them through Ship in an attack. The Fallen One was knocked unconscious at the cost of Ship's life. After this, Peter and the Fallen One were both sent to the [[Kyln]].
