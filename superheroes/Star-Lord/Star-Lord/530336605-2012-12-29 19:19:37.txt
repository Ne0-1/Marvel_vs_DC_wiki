'''Star-Lord''' ('''Peter Quill''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Steve Englehart]] and Steve Gan, the character first appeared in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan. 1976). The son of a human mother and alien father, Quill assumes the mantle of Star-Lord, an interplanetary policeman.

The character played a role in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] comic book events ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' (2006) and ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' (2007), and became the leader of the [[outer space|space]]-based superhero team [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the 2008 relaunch of the eponymous comic. He has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, and [[trading card]]s. He is set to appear in the 2014 live-action film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.

== Publication history ==
The character first appeared in the [[magazine]] publication ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #4 (Jan 1976).  Creator [[Steve Englehart]] had plans for the character that went unrealized, however, later reflecting on his [[website]]: 

{{blockquote|I conceived something very large. My hero would go from being an unpleasant, introverted jerk to the most cosmic being in the universe, and I would tie it into my then-new interest in [[astrology]]. After his earthbound beginning, his mind would be opened step by step, with a fast-action story on Mercury, a love story on Venus, a war story on Mars, and so on out to the edge of the solar system, and then beyond.

But — after his earthbound beginning, where I established him as an unpleasant, introverted jerk, I left Marvel, so no one ever saw what he was to become.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steveenglehart.com/Comics/Star-Lord.html |title=Star-Lord |publisher=Steveenglehart.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref>}}

Star-Lord continued to appear in ''Marvel Preview'', with writer [[Chris Claremont]] revamping the character and using science fiction adventure stories like the [[Heinlein juveniles]] for inspiration.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #11 (Summer 1977)</ref> Heinlein's lawyers threatened legal action over the cover, which featured a blurb that described the content as "a novel-length science fiction spectacular in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein," leading to the issue being pulled and reprinted.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/02/12/comic-book-legends-revealed-194/ ''Comic Book Legends Revealed'' #194], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 12, 2009</ref> The story in #11 was the first teaming of the celebrated ''X-Men'' creative trio of writer [[Chris Claremont]], penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]]. Star-Lord made sporadic appearances over the next few years in the titles ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'',<ref>''Marvel Super Special'' #10 (Winter 1979)</ref> ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'',<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' vol. 2, #6 - 7 (May - July 1980)</ref> and ''[[Marvel Premiere]]''.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #61 (Aug. 1981)</ref>

The character returned in ''[[Thanos]]'' #8-12 (May - Sept 2004) and ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (2006).  The following year, he received a four issue eponymous title (''Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord'') leading into the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' crossover event, in which he played a central role.  Spinning out of ''Annihilation: Conquest'', a second volume of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' featured a team of characters from the crossover who were led by Star-Lord for the duration of the title's 25-issue run.  Plot lines from that series were concluded in the ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' mini-series.

Star-Lord returned, along with other members of the Guardians, in ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'' #4-8 (June-October 2012). He will star in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3, a part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.<ref name="MarvelNOW">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610 |title=NYCC: Bendis, McNiven & Wacker Relaunch the "Guardians of the Galaxy" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 October 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical phenomenon when many of the planets  align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's father accuses his wife Meredith of infidelity and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden heart attack. Quill is raised by his single mother until she is killed by an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. Quill is placed in an orphanage but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee NASA astronaut. An alien entity called the ''Master of the Sun'' eventually visits the space station that Quill and other astronauts are inhabiting, and offers the mantle of ''Star-Lord'' (an interplanetary policeman) to a worthy candidate. Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favor of a colleague he once treated badly. 

Quill is outraged, and NASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. Instead, he steals a scoutship, returns to the space station, and takes his colleague's place. Quill becomes Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which the character is able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called "Ship", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord.<ref>''Marvel Preview'' #4 (Jan. 1976)</ref>

The character encounters the former [[Herald of Galactus]] the [[Fallen One]] and is almost killed defeating the entity (Star-Lord's vessel "Ship" is destroyed in the conflict). The pair are subsequently imprisoned in the intergalactic prison the [[Kyln]].<ref>''Thanos'' #8 - 12 (May - Sep. 2004)</ref> Star-Lord is freed by the hero [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] during the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]]'' and aids in the war against villain [[Annihilus]].<ref>''Annihilation'' #1 - 6 (Oct. 2006 - Mar. 2007)</ref> Quill later acts as military adviser to the [[Kree]] [[general]] [[Ronan the Accuser]]. 

When the Kree homeworld of [[Hala (comics)|Hala]] is conquered by the Phalanx, Star-Lord leads a band of rebels against the invaders until the war is over.<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2007)</ref> In an effort to prevent another interstellar war, Star-Lord forms a new version of the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. They are "proactive" and try to end emerging galactic threats early.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #1 (July 2008)</ref>

During the war with the [[The Thanos Imperative|Cancerverse]], Star-Lord appears to die.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #6 (December 2011)</ref> He reappears with the Guardians on Earth to aid the Avengers against Thanos.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' #3-8 (May–October 2012)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Star-Lord is a master strategist and problem solver who is an expert in close quarter combat, various human and alien firearms, battle techniques and has an extensive knowledge on various alien customs, societies and cultures, as well as various knowledge about cosmic abstracts such as [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]].

As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. The character also uses an "[[Classical element|Element Gun]]," a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the [[Classical element|four elements]] (air, earth, fire and water). Star-Lord also shares a [[psychic]] link with his [[sentient]] space vessel, "Ship."

The Ship is actually a sapient energy form. She most often exists in the form of a starship, but can alter her structure at will. She can travel through air, space and water. She possesses many of the conventional starship accessories, including shields, energy blasters, advanced [[sensors]], replicators (able to form any kind of food, drink, etc.), and [[hologram projectors]]. She has proven capable of creating a human form, which she can then animate and use as a host. Even if completely destroyed, she is capable of restoring herself, since her true form is her consciousness. In addition, she takes on a number of feminine characteristics, such as a mothering instinct for those she is partnered with. She has felt deeper attachments, including love for her partners.

Ship can create Widgets—small, mobile droids able to scout out situations, gather information, and then return to her. The full extent of Ship's abilities are unknown.

During Star-Lord's battle with The Fallen One, his Elemental Gun, suit and Ship were destroyed. Due to severe injury he was grafted with cybernetic implants by doctors on the Kyln, where he was sentenced. The eye implant allows him to see all energy spectrums and the memory chip in his brain gives him 100% recall.

On the Kree world of Aladon Prime Star-Lord's cybernetic implants were removed. Star-lord was outfitted with a Kree issued heat-dampening-espionage-battle suit, which became the hallmark look for the Guardians of the Galaxy, battle helmet and a universal translator, all of which he still uses. His battle helmet analyses strategy data, can improve vision and regulate oxygen when in space. 

Star-Lord's chosen weapons are two Kree sub-machine guns with various types of ammunition, including explosives.
