'''Sleepwalker''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character created by [[Bob Budiansky]], named after his race, and is the star of a self-titled comic book which ran for 33 issues from June, [[1991]] to February, [[1994]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Mindscape is a dimension that borders on the minds of all living things, inhabited by many strange creatures.  Some of them are very dangerous, seeking to invade the sleeping minds of humans.  The Sleepwalkers act to defend these minds, almost as a sort of "dream police", apprehending such evil creatures.  One such Sleepwalker was tricked by his archenemy Cobweb (who like Sleepwalker had a real name that is unpronounceable by humans) into entering the mind of a New York college student named Rick Sheridan and became trapped.

Rick himself is an ordinary human being, majoring in [[Film Studies]] as a college student.  He lived in a [[Brooklyn]] apartment with his dog Rambo, where he worked as a [[building superintendent]], doing maintenance work in exchange for living rent-free. He also earns a living as a part-time job teaching English to immigrants.  

After a few confrontations in Rick's dreams, Rick reacts by tearing off Sleepwalker's Imaginator (a badge like device worn by Sleepwalkers used to teleport around the Mindscape, and to banish and imprison monsters they captured). This causes the two to become bonded. When Rick sleeps, Sleepwalker could materialize in reality or he could stay in Rick's mind and converse with him via his dreams.  It was through a conversation in dreams that Sleepwalker is able to dispel Rick's initial fears that he was a malicious entity and work out agreeable terms to cohabitation.

Rick and Sleepwalker eventually worked out an understanding, allowing the alien to fight crime and various injustices. This was not easy, as Sleepwalker's appearance caused fear among regular people.

Sleepwalker is one of the few entities who remember the events of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]. Sleepwalker spent most of it fighting the villains called the Chain Gang and rescuing people from numerous natural disasters. However, the villain called [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] turned back time, neutralizing what he had gone through. He considers his vague memories to be just a dream.  

Sleepwalker played an important role in the ''[[Infinity War]]'', helping to defeat the forces of the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], by channeling mental powers from [[Professor X]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Psylocke]] and the woman known as [[Moondragon]] through Rick Sheridan's mind.  He also contributed to the battle against the evil clones of the superheroes, fighting the clones of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Firestar]] and [[Daredevil]], saving the lives of a number of innocent New York civilians. Part of the fight against the evil doubles involved Sleepwalker impersonating his own evil clone.  

In ''[[Infinity Crusade]]'', Sleepwalker is brainwashed by the Goddess and taken to a planet on the other side of the sun. He keeps Rick asleep by drugging the orange juice in his fridge. During the battle between the Goddess' forces and the rest of Earth's heroes, Sleepwalker subdues [[Darkhawk]] and the [[Human Torch]] by dragging them into the water with his shape-changing powers.

Later in the series, Cobweb put in motion a complicated plot to invade the Earth and disrupt Rick's relationship with Sleepwalker. This involves disguising his minions as members of Sleepwalker's race and framing his archenemy as their leader. The plot is only partially successful; Sleepwalker and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] thwart the initial attack, although Sleepwalker's reputation was ruined in the process. Many people still mistakenly believe that Sleepwalker's race planned to invade and conquer the Earth, and that Sleepwalker himself was an advanced scout for the invasion force, betraying his own people to protect humanity. 

Later, Sleepwalker thwarts Cobweb's second attack and banishes the monster once and for all, before seemingly dying to save Rick Sheridan's life. However, Sleepwalker would later turn up alive and still trapped in Rick's mind, 

Sleepwalker gains the abillity to interact with the real world again. He is seen in "Marvel Teamup" #10 (Sept. 2005) investigating the aftereffects of an explosion caused by the villainous [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]].

==Powers and abilities==
Sleepwalker possesses super strength, exceptional durability and resistance to injury, and floatation-like flight. His only offensive power was his "warp gaze".  With this vision-based power, Sleepwalker could alter the shape of physical objects and twist them to his purposes.  He could also modify the physical characteristics of the objects he affected-making them harder or softer, for example.  Sleepwalker initially demonstrated this power by using it to distort a sidewalk to capture a criminal.  He also used this ability once on air molecules to create a wind tunnel for faster aerial travel.  Owing to an oath sworn by all members of his race, Sleepwalker tried not to use his warp beams on living entities.  

The effects of the warp vision on living entities was demonstrated when Rick, trapped in Sleepwalker's body after an encounter with the Chain Gang, inadvertently used the beam on his former girlfriend Alyssa Conover, who was about to kill Sleepwalker in Rick's body.  Sleepwalker's vision causes living bodies to twist and contort, causing intense physical agony in the process, although this effect is only temporary.  The beam also has the side effect of breaking the mental control of any outside entity possessing the victim's mind, expelling the controller in the process.  As a result, Rick unintentionally freed Alyssa from the domination of the Chain Gang, a tactic Sleepwalker himself would later adopt when freeing other people from the mental enslavement of Cobweb's minions.  In exceptional circumstances, Sleepwalker's warp beams could also incapacitate and then banish demonic creatures, as he did to defeat Mr. Jyn.  

As an alien resident of the Mindscape, Sleepwalker had exceptional visual abilities, being able to see over a much farther distance than an average human, as well as being able to see and follow energy trails.  Instead of food, Sleepwalker fed on mental energy, needing to periodically return to Rick's mind to be able to regain his strength.  When Rick appeared to be dead, Sleepwalker formed a temporary bond with a homeless man named Pike to borrow some of his mental energy, although he did this only with Pike's express permission.  His training as a warrior of the Mindscape also gives him a certain amount of knowledge about various [[supernatural]] entities and the workings of the mind, a trait he put to good use in helping [[Professor X]] and other telepaths in channelling psychic energy through Rick's mind without harming his human host.  

Being a resident of the mental plane also gives Sleepwalker a resistance, but not an immunity, to various mental attacks.  When battling the monster Psyko, a creature that had the power to instil madness in his opponents, Sleepwalker briefly suffered from insanity, although he managed to resist and overcome Psyko's madness to finally defeat him.  It is unknown whether this resistance would apply to other types of psionic attacks used by various other telepathic heroes or villains.  

Sleepwalker had several notable weaknesses.  The first was his bond to Rick-whenever Rick awoke or regained consciousness, Sleepwalker would automatically disappear from the human world and return to Rick's mind.  At the same time, Sleepwalker's strength was related to his connection with the ground and the earth-the higher he levitated, the weaker he would get, although he gained his full strength when actually standing on the ground itself.  Similarly, Sleepwalker would weaken if he did not return to Rick's mind to rest and renew his supply of mental energy, which happened both when Rick was killed during the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] and when Rick seemed to be dead (actually a ruse by Sleepwalker to protect him from Cobweb's minions).  Finally, upon being exposed to a certain frequency of light, Sleepwalker initially experienced [[hallucinations]] and other pleasurable effects that distracted him from his frustration and anger at being hated and rejected by humans, despite his attempts to help them.  He became [[addicted]] to the light, using it to escape his problems in a way similar to [[drug abuse]] or [[alcoholism]].  Sleepwalker's obsession with the light had tragic consequences, including the creation of Spectra and putting Rick into a [[coma]].  Horrified at what he had done, Sleepwalker managed to overcome his addiction and saved Rick's mind from the invasion of the Thought Police.

==Enemies==
Sleepwalker possessed a colorful gallery of mostly original villains, with a new one introduced each issue during the title's beginnings.  Some of them include the billiard based [[8-Ball (comics)|8-Ball]], ultra nerdy [[Bookworm (Marvel Comics)|Bookworm]], prison escapees [[The Chain Gang (comics)|The Chain Gang]], light-manipulating [[Spectra (comics)|Spectra]], evil genie [[Mr. Jyn (comics)|Mr. Jyn]], extra-dimensional demon [[Cobweb (Marvel Comics)|Cobweb]], mutated serial killer [[Psyko(comics)|Psyko]], and hypnotic songstress [[Lullaby (comics)|Lullaby]].  Sleepwalker also faced non-powered foes like the would-be kingpin [[Crimewave (comics)|Crimewave]] and obsessed government agent [[Toliver Smith]], the founder of the [[Thought Police (comics)|Thought Police]].

Sleepwalker's original villains faded into obscurity faster than Sleepwalker himself and haven't been seen since the end of the series, save for 8-Ball who appeared briefly in the 2005 ''[[She-Hulk]]'' series and the ''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'' mini-series.

Sleepwalker also battled the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] and teamed up with Darkhawk and [[Spider-Man]] to battle the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] to rescue the mutant [[Portal (comics)|Portal]].

==Other versions==
===''Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers''===
Sleepwalker features in an arc of [[Robert Kirkman]]'s ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 3), featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed "The League of Losers". A group of heroes including Sleepwalker, [[Darkhawk]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], [[Araña]], [[X-23]], [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] and [[Terror Inc.|Terror]] (although Araña dies along the way) go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing [[Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]]' time machine, Chronok having come to the present and already having killed all of Marvel's major heroes. 

It is revealed Chronok is from the same time period as Kirkman's [[Mutant 2099]]; the group stays with him and his mentor Reed Richards to wait for Chronok. During this time, Sleepwalker experiences difficulties with being away from his host Rick Sheridan, but ultimately comes to terms with it. The team defeats Chronok, but at the end of the story, Richards reveals they can't go back to their present, due to time-travel and alternate timelines. The group decides to stay in the future, satisfied with the impact they made, however unnoticed. Mutant 2099 suggests reforming the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] or the "Fantastic Nine".

Note that due to the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|method for resolving time travel paradoxes]], this story occurred in an alternate universe.

==Background==
Budiansky's concept dates to the late [[1970s]]; however, he originally called the character ''Alien'' until the [[Alien (film)|Ridley Scott film]] of the same name was released, at which point he shelved the character.

The character finally saw release in reaction to the [[DC Comics]] character [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]], written by [[Neil Gaiman]].  Popular legend is that Marvel, at the time, announced in a press release that Sleepwalker was "Sandman done right"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, although it is not known if this is actually true.
 
A second '''Sleepwalker''' character was planned to receive a self-titled series by [[Robert Kirkman]] in 2004 but instead debuted in the 2004 ''[[Epic Anthology]]'', which was cancelled after one issue.  The original Sleepwalker's next appearance was in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #15 nearly a decade after his original cancellation.

==In other media==
===Film===
An issue of Sleepwalker is shown in the comic book scene of the movie, ''[[True Romance]]''. [[Christian Slater]]'s character is shown skimming through the pages but the description he gives of the story is not what is actually happening in the comic book.
