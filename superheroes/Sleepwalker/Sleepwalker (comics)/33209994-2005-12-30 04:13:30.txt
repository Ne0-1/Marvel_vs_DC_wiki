'''Sleepwalker''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character created by [[Bob Budiansky]], named after his race, and is the star of a self-titled comic book which ran for 33 issues from June, [[1991]] to February, [[1994]].

==History==
The sleepwalkers were dream police.  In that capacity, they apprehended any beings that invaded the sleeping minds of humans.  Sleepwalker was tricked by his long time foe known as Cob Web (who like Sleepwalker had a real name that is unpronnouncable by human language) into entering the mind of one individual (a New York college student named Rick Sheridan) and became trapped.

After a few confrontations in Ricks dreams, Rick reacted by tearing off Sleepwalkers Imaginator (a badge like device worn by sleepwalkers used to teleport around their home plane The Mind Scape). This resulted in an odd situation further tying the two together. When Rick slept, Sleepwalker could materialize in reality or he could stay in Ricks mind and converse with him via his dreams. It was through a conversation in dreams that Sleepwalker was able to dispell Rick's initial fears that he was a malicious enitity and work out agreeable terms to cohabitation.

==Powers==
He possesed super strength and flotation-like flight. Sleepwalker's only offensive power was his "warp gaze".  With this vision based power, Sleepwalker could alter the shape of physical objects and twist them to his purposes.  Sleepwalker initially demonstrated this power by using it to distort a sidewalk to capture a criminal. He also used this ability once on air molecules to create a wind tunnel for faster aerial travel.

He had three notable weaknesses. Firstly would be that he'd automatically disappear from the material plane at whatever point Rick would awaken from sleep. This would often lead to his current heroic endeavor being aborted before he could accomplish his given task. Second the further he floated from the ground the weaker he would get. The other weakness (which developed later in the series) was an addiction to certain types of light. This addiction became so overwhelming that Sleepwalker forced his way out of Rick's waking mind putting the young man into a temporary coma.

==Rogues Gallery==
Sleepwalker possesed a colorful gallery of mostly original villans. Some of them could be considred corny even by the standards of their day. Some of them include the billard based 8-Ball, ultra nerdy Bookworm, prison escapees The Chain Gang and hypnotic songstress Lullaby. These kooky crooks faded into obscurity faster than Sleepwalker himself and haven't been seen since the end of the series.

==Background==
The character was created in reaction to the [[DC Comics]] character [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]], written by [[Neil Gaiman]].  Marvel, at the time, announced in a press release that Sleepwalker was "Sandman done right".  Most consider this arrogant at best: Sandman has gone on to become one of the most highly-regarded works in the medium, while Sleepwalker has remained obscure. He only made a few appearances in other marvel comics when his own series was still running. After the cancellation of his ongoing series Sleepwalker faded into the large limbo of unused Marvel characters.

Budiansky's concept dates to the late [[1970s]]; however, he originally called the character ''Alien'' until the [[Ridley Scott]] [[film]] of the same name was released, at which point he shelved the character.

A second '''Sleepwalker''' character debuted in the 2004 [[Epic Anthology]].
Sleepwalker's next Appearance is in the League of Losers with Darkhawk and Speedball in Marvel Team Up #15
