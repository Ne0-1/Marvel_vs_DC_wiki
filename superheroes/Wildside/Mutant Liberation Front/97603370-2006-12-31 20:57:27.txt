'''The Mutant Liberation Front,''' or '''MLF,''' was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] group, primarily enemies of [[X-Force]]. Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist/co-writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the original MLF first fully appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #87 ([[1990#March|March 1990]]).

The Mutant Liberation group consisted of young [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutants]], formed under the mutant [[time travel]]ler [[Stryfe]]. After his apparent death, the group reformed under [[Sunspot (comics)#Reignfire Controversy|Reignfire]].

==History==
The Mutant Liberation Front first appeared in New Mutants #87 (the same time as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], they both had a cameo on the last page of #86). The MLF was primarily the antagonist of the [[New Mutants]], and their later incarnation, [[X-Force]]. They also fought the second incarnation of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and were eventually defeated by the [[X-Men]] during the [[X-Cutioner's Song]]. A second incarnation was assembled later by a villain known as Reignfire (see [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]).

The team seemed mainly organized of disillusioned, anarchaic [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] youths. Stryfe founded the group sometime after coming to the 20th century (from roughly 2,000 years in the future). They were likely assembled as a tool while Stryfe assembled his master plan which he executed in the [[X-Cutioner's Song]]. The exact size of the organization is unknown, but they were seen to have had several advanced bases around the world, and employed a number of presumably human guards.

When the team first appeared, it was during the debut of new New Mutants artists [[Rob Liefeld]], and the team was his creation (with [[Louise Simonson]]). Their first mission was to rescue [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], two New Mutants who had been captured by the Government. Rusty and Skids would not be seen for some time later, but when they were it was revealed that they stayed with the group due to mind control devices Stryfe implanted in them. It was never indicated that any of the others members had similar implants.

After the organization was dismantled in the X-Cutioner's Song, four of the imprisoned members (Wildside, Reaper, Forearm and Tempo) were liberated and recruited by a mysterious villain named Reignfire, who was believed to be a futuristic version of [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. Already among the ranks of the new MLF were former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]] member Moonstar (undercover on behalf of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]) and Locus. X-Force's Feral also defected to the MLF, and Tempo betrayed them and went her own way.  After a few minor missions, including a group that infiltrated [[Muir Island]] to obtain information on the [[Legacy Virus]], the group was captured by members of [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] and never reformed.
