'''The Mutant Liberation Front,''' or '''MLF,''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] group appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The group has been depicted as primarily enemies of [[X-Force]]. Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[Rob Liefeld]], the Mutant Liberation Front first appeared in ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'' #86 (February 1990).

The Mutant Liberation group consisted of young [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], formed under the mutant [[time travel|time-traveler]] [[Stryfe]]. After his apparent death, the group reforms under [[Reignfire]].

==History==
The Mutant Liberation Front first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #86. In this brief initial appearance only five of the original eight members can be seen clearly; [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]] and [[Stryfe]] appear in only one panel each, with their faces obscured, while all that can be seen of [[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]] is his two right arms in a single panel. The MLF was primarily the antagonist of the New Mutants and their successor group, [[X-Force]]. They are eventually defeated by a consortium of X-Force, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and the [[X-Men]] during the "[[X-Cutioner's Song]]" [[story arc]]. A second incarnation is assembled later by a villain known as [[Reignfire]].

The team seemed mainly organized of disillusioned, anarchic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] youths. Stryfe founded the group sometime after coming to the 20th century (from roughly 2,000 years in the future). They were likely assembled as a tool while Stryfe assembled his master plan which he executed in "X-Cutioner's Song". The exact size of the organization is unknown, but they were seen to have had several advanced bases around the world and employed a number of presumably human guards.

The team's first mission was to rescue [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], two New Mutants who had been captured by the government. Rusty and Skids would not be seen for some time, but when they were it was revealed that they stayed with the group due to mind control devices Stryfe implanted in them. It was never indicated that any of the other members had similar implants.

After the organization was dismantled in the "X-Cutioner's Song", four of the imprisoned members ([[Forearm (comics)|Forearm]] Reaper, [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]] and [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] ) were liberated and recruited by a mysterious villain named Reignfire, who was believed to be a futuristic version of [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. Already among the ranks of the new MLF were former New Mutant [[Dani Moonstar]] (undercover on behalf of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]) and Locus. X-Force's [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] also defected to the MLF, and Tempo betrayed them and went her own way.  After a few minor missions, including a group that infiltrated [[Muir Island]] to obtain information on the [[Legacy Virus]], the group was captured by members of [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] and disbanded.

Recently, the team was reformed and faced the X-Men, in the relaunched Uncanny X-Men series.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

Forearm lost his first match-up against [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], who snapped Forearm's neck. Inexplicably surviving this, Forearm was revealed to be one of the many mutants who lost their powers after Decimation. Under unknown circumstances, Forearm regained his powers and joined the latest version of the Mutant Liberation Front as they battled the X-Men once again.

During the ''[[Dawn of X]]'' storyline, Forearm was seen among the mutant villains invited to join the X-Men on the island of [[Krakoa]].

Reaper served with both the first and second incarnations of the team and briefly joined the [[Ultraverse]]'s [[Exiles (Malibu Comics)|Exiles]] alongside [[Siena Blaze]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. He was then seen as a member of [[Weapon X]], though a mission with that group left him comatose. After Decimation, Reaper lost his powers.

|-

||A mutant with multiple layers of elastic, fatty tissue which granted him superhuman strength, endurance, and resistance to physical injury.

|-
||[[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]]
||Heather Tucker
||''New Mutants'' #86 (February 1990)
||A mutant with the ability of flight and time manipulation. One of the most powerful members of the Mutant Liberation Front, Tempo joined the team on several missions, and continued with the group as Reignfire took over. She later betrayed the MLF, prompting an invitation to join X-Force by Cable. Tempo rejected the offer, opting instead to attend college. After Decimation, Tempo was one of the few mutants left on Earth. She joined the Acolytes, and later joined the X-Men in the ''[[Age of X]]'' storyline.

Thumbelina left the group after Reignfire took over as leader. After Decimation, Thumbelina retained her powers and joined [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s support group for mutants.
|-
||'''Wildside'''
||Richard Gill
||''New Mutants'' #86 (February 1990)
||A mutant with the ability to disrupt a person's sense of reality. Unrelated to his powers were his sharp clawed gloves he wore, as he preferred to torture and maim his opponents. Wildside participated in all of the MLF's missions and continued to work with the group as Reignfire took over. Later, alongside Reaper, Wildside joined Weapon X. A mission against Cable left the pair effectively brain dead, though Wildside managed to regain his health. After Decimation, Wildside lost his powers, though he regained his powers using the Mothervine. He later rejoined the latest incarnation of the Mutant Liberation Front.

During the ''[[Dawn of X]]'' storyline, Wildside was seen among the mutant villains invited to join the X-Men on the island of [[Krakoa]].
