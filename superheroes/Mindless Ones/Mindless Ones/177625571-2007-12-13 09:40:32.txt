'''The Mindless Ones''' are [[fiction]]al [[monster]]s appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe.]] Their first appearance was in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' [http://www.docstrange.com/profiles/mindless.asp #127]

They are extra-dimensional creatures summoned via magic to do the bidding of others. (They have no will of their own.)

A long time ago, the wizard king Olnar sat on the throne of the Dark Dimension. He was visited by Umar and [[Dormammu]], Faltine siblings. During this time, a realm was annexed by Olnar, which turned out to hold the Mindless Ones. They rampaged throughout the lands, killing many including Olnar and almost slaying the two Faltine. The siblings created a barrier to keep them contained. 

They appear to have a thick, roughly humanoid shape standing taller than most men and a hide that appears to be made of rock. They have no faces to speak of except a single glowing eye from which they can fire a blast of energy. As befits their appearance they are inhumanly strong and invulnerable. They have savage dispositions and minimal intelligence.
They are most often seen in the employ of '''Dormammu''', although they have also been utilized by others such as '''[[Doctor Doom]]''', '''Dr. Midas''' (in the pages of [[Noh-Varr|Marvel Boy]]) and a fellow Faltine named '''Rorkannu''' (in ''[[Nextwave|Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.]]'').

Dr. Doom uses them after gaining high levels of magical power via deal with demonic entities. The Mindless ones are utilized to beat on Ben Grimm, a member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. 

In another, separate incident, they invaded and destroyed much of [[New York City]]'s famed [[Times Square]]. A force that includes [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] and [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]] help stop them. During this adventure, a possible future was shown in which the Mindless Ones had devastated much of the surrounding country. [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane Watson-Parker]] was shown brutally being killed. The Mindless Ones were finally defeated when Mr. Fantastic creates a machine that manipulates their magical energies, drawing them back to where they came from. This, unfortunately, results in the temporary return of Dormammu, but thanks to a spell that went wrong, Spider-Man (Guided by an alternate version of Doctor Strange that apparently ceases to exist as a result of his actions) is able to travel back in time and stop Reed using the machine until Doctor Strange can arrive to solve the problem himself.

When Rorkannu uses them, they forgo their usual smashing, in place of very particular and careful murder, plus the impersonation of various civilian jobs. They are still slaughtered by Nextwave. Rorkannu is tracked down, his Mindless Ones summoning circle destroyed and he receives a severe beating in a public restroom.

The Mindless Ones appeared in an issue of [[Cable & Deadpool]] in which [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] and [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]] encounter them in their own dimension. They alternately attack and worship the two protagonists, evidently mistaking the light from a [[glowstick]] for some sort of magical power, and revering whoever it seemed to be emanating from.
