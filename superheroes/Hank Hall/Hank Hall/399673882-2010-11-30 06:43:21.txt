==Fictional character biography==
===Hawk and Dove===
{{main|Hawk and Dove}}
Hank Hall was originally the [[superhero]] Hawk, of [[Hawk and Dove]]. Hawk represented "chaos", while Dove represented "order". His brother, Don Hall, the original Dove, died during [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. Don was replaced with Dawn Granger, who mysteriously acquired her powers in [[London]].<ref name="dc-exta"/>

===''Armageddon 2001:'' Monarch===
{{main|Monarch (comics)}}
Monarch was an oppressive tyrant from a bleak, dystopian Earth fifty years in the future. The people were unhappy with his rule, particularly a scientist named [[Waverider (comics)|Matthew Ryder]], an expert on [[Time|temporal]] studies, who was convinced he could use his technology to travel back in time and prevent the maniacal ruler from ever coming to power. He learned that forty years ago, one of Earth's heroes would eventually turn evil and become Monarch, and ten years from that would conquer the world. During a time travel experiment, Matthew was transformed into a being called "Waverider", and began searching the timestream for the hero who would become Monarch, not knowing that Monarch was following him. When Monarch came into battle with the heroes of the present day, he killed Dove, and her enraged partner killed him for it. Removing the villain's mask, Hank discovered that he was Monarch, and donned the armor.<ref name="dc-exta"/>

===Armageddon: The Alien Agenda===
{{main|Armageddon: The Alien Agenda}}
When hostile aliens encounter Monarch and [[Captain Atom]] in the past (sometime between 230 and 65 million years ago), they attempt to enlist both (without either's knowledge) to assist them in creating a wormhole. The wormhole's creation would destroy the universe in which the primitive Earth existed, but would allow the aliens to travel freely.

===''Zero Hour:'' Extant===
{{main|Zero Hour (comics)}}
Shortly after returning to the present, Monarch confronted Waverider and used his power to see the past and future to become aware of the power within him. It is explained at this point, that when Monarch killed Dove, her powers went directly into Hawk. Realising this, Monarch unleashes his hidden powers to become Extant. Extant removes the Waveriders time-traveling device and joins forces with renegade [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]], now known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], in a plan to alter time as they saw fit (as seen in ''Zero Hour'').<ref name="dc-exta"/>

His first act was to alter the future so that he could have a [[metahuman]] army at his disposal, mostly consisting of members of the [[Teen Titans]]; his plan was to amass an army so powerful that no one could interfere with his efforts to control time itself.  Several heroes banded together to stop his plans before they began in the 30th century, and altered history so that his followers never came to exist in the future.

Down, but not out, Extant began to strike back at the heroes at Ground Zero, the beginning of time. Parallax had warped several metahumans from various time periods together for the ultimate assault, and Extant hit the Atom with a chronal blast, de-aging him into a teenager. Sensing defeat was imminent, he escaped the fight, only to engage the [[Justice Society]] on a later date as he sought to acquire the reality-warping power of the Worlogog, recently dismantled by [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]] because he feared its power. Although Extant succeeded in his goal with the aid of [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]'s stolen Mobius Chair, [[Hector Hall|Doctor Fate]] learned from the imprisoned [[Mordru]] that when Hourman had dismantled the Worlogog, he had retained a small fragment of it, thus creating infinitesimal flaw in the prime Worlogog that the JSA could exploit. 

After the resurrected Dove sacrificed herself to distract Extant, Hourman divided his Hour of Power amongst his teammates, thus granting them all immunity to his reality warping powers for four minutes, each of them attacking him on a different temporal plane until they were able to separate him from the Worlogog. Following this setback, Extant again attempted to escape. Instead, Extant was teleported by Hourman and Metron, at [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]]'s behest, into the seat of an airplane whose crash [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] had caused earlier (in his relative timestream). As a result of this, Atom Smasher's mother was saved (as she was on the plane when it crashed), but Atom Smasher replaced his mother with a weakened Extant, saving her life but murdering the supervillain.

Extant made an appearance in ''[[Booster Gold]]'' (vol. 2) #0 (2008), in a time travel adventure where Booster Gold crosses paths with Extant in the timestream during the events of ''Zero Hour''.

===''Blackest Night''===
[[Image:Hawk WhiteL-.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The resurrected [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]] Hawk from ''Birds of Prey'' #4. Art by [[Ryan Sook]].]]
In the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Hank Hall is reanimated as a member of the undead [[Black Lantern Corps]]. The [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power rings]] also try to reanimate his brother Don, but are denied, stating "Don Hall of Earth at Peace."<ref name="bn2">''Blackest Night'' #2 (August 2009)</ref> Hank then tracks down and attacks Dawn and the new Hawk, her sister Holly. After a short battle, Hank rams his hand into Holly's chest, ripping her heart out, and using it to charge his ring.<ref name="bnt1">''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1 (August 2009)</ref> Holly's body is then revived by a black ring, and the two attack Dawn together. Outmatched, Dawn retreats, with Hank and Holly giving chase.<ref name="bnt2">''Blackest Night: Titans'' #2 (September 2009)</ref> Hank and Holly follow Dawn to [[Titans Tower]], where more Black Lantern Titans are attacking the living heroes. The two eventually overwhelm Dawn, with Holly plunging her hand 
into Dawn's chest. Dawn suddenly radiates a white energy that completely destroys Holly's body and ring. The others Black Lanterns seeing Dawn as their greatest threat attack her, however she turns the light on them, destroying all but Hank, [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], and 
[[Terra (comics)|Terra]], who quickly retreat.<ref name="bnt3">''Blackest Night: Titans'' #3 (October 2009)</ref> While battling the Black Lanterns at [[Coast City]], Hank is later brought back to life by the power of the white light.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref> Dawn has a vision of Don Hall, who tells Dawn that she can save Hank, and to not give up on him.<ref name="bnt3"/>

===''Brightest Day/Birds of Prey''===
At the beginning of the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' event, Hank and Dawn begin working together again as a crime-fighting duo. Dawn expresses worries over Hank's increasingly violent demeanor, but he simply brushes off her concerns.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0</ref> While stopping a group of teenaged criminals in [[Gotham City]], Hank and Dawn are invited by [[Zinda Blake]] to join the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> The two are immediately called by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to help [[Black Canary]] and [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] during their battle with a dangerous villainess known as the White Canary. Hawk attempts to defeat her himself, but is surprised when White Canary is somehow able to dodge his attack and then draw blood from him.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #2</ref> Hank and Dawn later encounter [[Deadman]], who Hank asks to resurrect Don.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #4 (June 2010)</ref> At a crater in [[Silver City, New Mexico]], Deadman attempts to revive Don, only to be prevented from doing so by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #5-6 (July 2010)</ref> As a number of onlookers (including [[Aqualad#Jackson Hyde|Jackson Hyde]]) watch the Entity speak to the heroes, it instructs Hank to catch the boomerang that [[Captain Boomerang]] will throw at Dove.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref>

After being injured during an encounter with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], Hank is sent to a hospital while his teammates plan their next move. During his hospital stay, Hank has a vision of himself, clad in a White Lantern uniform and talking to Don. Just before the dream ends, Don assures his brother that he is at peace.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' (vol. 2) #5 (September 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Whether he is Monarch or Extant, Hank Hall possesses the same superpowers: enhanced strength, durability, speed, agility, vision, and a [[healing factor]].<ref>Brightest Day #0</ref> Without his partner Dove to suppress his violent nature, his rage is boundless. His armor, crafted using advanced technology, is highly durable. After absorbing the powers of Waverider, he became Extant, giving him the ability to travel through time and control time. After piecing together the Worlogog, Extant was elevated to a nigh-omnipotent, god-like status, only lacking a slight fraction of the power necessary to be truly omnipotent.

As a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Hank wielded a black power ring, which allowed him to fly and generate black energy constructs. He was also able to perceive [[Emotional spectrum|emotional auras]]. However, whilst he was able to perceive Holly's aura as red for rage, he saw Dawn's as a pure white that his ring could not identify.

==Monarch origin retcons==
{{Trivia|date=April 2010}}
*In order to explain why the irrational Hawk had become the evil but rational Monarch, some issues of ''Showcase'' revealed that a portion of Dove's ordered and rational soul had fused within Hank. This led to his change into Extant.
*A second retcon, shown in ''JSA'', revealed that Hall was possessed by [[Mordru]], but when Mordru left Hank's body, he had already been corrupted and become evil.

==Other versions==
*In the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' miniseries, and its sequel ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', a version of Hank Hall exists, alongside the original Dove.
*''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #26 features an alternate reality created by the trickster god [[Anansi]]. In this reality, an armored version of Hawk is seen.
