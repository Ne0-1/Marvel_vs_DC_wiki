'''Shalla-Bal''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the Empress of her [[utopian]] [[planet]], [[Zenn-La]], and was the lover of Norrin Radd. When the planet-eating [[Galactus]] came to their planet, Norrin Radd volunteered to become the herald of Galactus in exchange for sparing Zenn-La. Norrin Radd was given the Power Cosmic and became the [[Silver Surfer]], thus separating him from Shalla-Bal for a long time.

Eventually, the Surfer rebelled against Galactus, who trapped him on the planet [[Earth]] as a [[punishment]].  The [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] who desires to defeat the Surfer and steal his noble soul, sensed the anguish of this separation within him, and on numerous occasions used Shalla-Bal as a pawn in his conflicts with the Surfer.  As part of a conspiracy Mephisto replaced the consciousness of Shalla-Bal so that she believed herself to be a regular citizen of [[Latveria]] and [[Dr. Doom]] organized a false marriage celebration with her in order to make the Surfer fight the [[Fantastic Four]]. 

Meanwhile Galactus consumed the life energies of Zenn-La because of Silver Surfer's betrayal, but spared the lives of its people by warning them of his coming beforehand, allowing them to return to the lifeless husk afterwards. When [[Mister Fantastic]] freed the Surfer from his imprisonment, he returned to Zenn-La to find it in this state and learned that Shalla-Bal had been taken by the Mephisto. Finally understanding the conspiracy Surfer returned to Latveria to find Shalla-Bal meanwhile imprisoning himself once again on the [[Earth]].  The Surfer bestowed a portion of his [[Power Cosmic]] to Shalla-Bal while Mephisto was sending her back to her planet, and she was able to use this power to restore the life on Zenn-La thus being accepted as an Empress by her people.  However the responsibilities of her office made Shalla-Bal refuse marriage with the Surfer when he eventually broke free from Earth for good.

Shalla helped Norrin unravel a [[Skrull]] plot against the Kree Empire.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #30 (Nov 1989)</ref>

After years of rejection, Shalla-Bal once became romantically involved with Fennan Radd - a man who claimed to be the Silver Surfer's half-brother by his father. Fennan claimed to have been born after Norrin's mother Elmar committed suicide.
