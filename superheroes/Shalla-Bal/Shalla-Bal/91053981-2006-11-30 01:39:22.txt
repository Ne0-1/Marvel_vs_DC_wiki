'''Shalla-Bal''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  She is the Empress of her utopian planet, Zenn-La, and was the lover of Norrin Radd.  When the planet-eating [[Galactus]] came to their planet, Norrin Radd volunteered to become the herald of Galactus in exchange for sparing Zenn-La.  Norrin Radd was given the Power Cosmic and became the [[Silver Surfer]], thus separating him from Shalla-Bal for a long time.

The demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] sensed the anguish of this separation within the Surfer, and on numerous occasions used Shalla-Bal as a pawn in his conflicts with the Surfer.

Eventually, the Surfer rebelled against Galactus, who trapped him on the planet Earth as punishment.  Galactus consumed the life energies of Zenn-La, but spared the lives of its people by warning them of his coming beforehand, allowing them to return to the lifeless husk afterwards.  When [[Mister Fantastic]] freed the Surfer from his imprisonment, he returned to Zenn-La to find it in this state.  The Surfer bestowed a portion of his Power Cosmic to Shalla-Bal, and she was able to use this power to restore the life to Zenn-La.
