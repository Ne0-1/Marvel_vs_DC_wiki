'''Bucky''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941). Originally '''James Buchanan Barnes''', the alias of Bucky has been used by several individuals in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==History==
===Origins===
Barnes (named after [[James Buchanan]], the 15th [[President of the United States]]) was an orphan, the son of a soldier killed in training at Camp Lehigh just before the United States' entry into [[World War II]]. As a result, he was unofficially adopted by the camp as a mascot. Nicknamed "Bucky", he took to wearing a uniform and becoming savvy with the ins and outs of military life even though he was a teenager. It was at Lehigh that he met and befriended Private Steven Rogers, who by all appearances was the clumsiest soldier in the camp. This was at the same time that reports of the then-mysterious [[Captain America]] began to appear in news magazines, and Barnes eagerly devoured the accounts of this new hero.

One night, however, he looked into Rogers's tent and saw that his friend was changing into the uniform of Captain America. Barnes made a deal to keep the secret of Rogers' [[secret identity|dual identity]] if he could become his [[sidekick]]. Rogers agreed, and trained Barnes appropriately. Together, Captain America and Bucky fought [[Nazism|Nazis]] both at home and abroad, as a duo and as part of the superhero team known as the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Barnes also teamed up with the sidekicks of other heroes in a group called the [[Young Allies]].

In the closing days of World War II in 1945, Captain America and Bucky tried to stop the villainous [[Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]]. Zemo launched the plane with an armed explosive device on it, with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. They reached the plane just before it took off. Bucky unsuccessfully tried to defuse the bomb, and it exploded in mid-air. The young man was killed instantly, and Rogers was hurled into the freezing waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. Rogers' body, preserved in [[suspended animation]] in a block of ice, would only be found decades later by [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] (''Avengers'' #4, March 1964).

===The Bucky legacy===
Fearing that the deaths of Captain America and Bucky, if revealed, would be a blow to morale, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] asked William Naslund, the hero known as the Spirit of '76, to assume the identity of Captain America. Assisting him was '''Fred Davis''', a former bat-boy for the [[New York Yankees]], who had previously posed as Bucky in 1942. The new Captain America and Bucky finished the rest of the war and continued to fight crime with the [[All Winners Squad]] and the Liberty Legion. Naslund was killed in 1946 fighting the [[android]] Adam II, and Captain America's identity passed to Jeff Mace, the Patriot (''What If'' #4, August 1977).

Davis assisted Mace until 1948, when he was shot and wounded, forcing him to retire and leaving him with a permanent limp. In 1951, Davis joined the secret war-criminal hunting organization known as the V-Battalion, and eventually became one of its leaders on the Penance Council. He also ran for public office, eventually becoming a [[United States Senate|senator]]. (''Captain America Comics'' #66, 1948; ''Citizen V and the V-Battalion'' #1-#4, 2001).

In 1953, an orphan named '''Jack Monroe''', who idolized Captain America and Bucky, discovered that his history teacher also had a similar passion, to the extent of undergoing plastic surgery to make him look like Steve Rogers and assuming his name as well. In addition, "Rogers" had discovered, in some old Nazi files stored in a warehouse in [[Germany]], the lost formula for the Super-Soldier serum that had given Captain America his abilities. The two used the serum and began to fight [[Communism|Communists]] as Captain America and Bucky (''Young Men'' #24, December 1953).

Unfortunately, "Rogers" and Monroe were unaware of the stabilizing "Vita-Ray" process used on the original Captain America. As a result, despite their bodies being enhanced to peak human efficiency, they slowly grew [[paranoia|paranoid]] and dangerously insane. By the middle of 1954 they were irrationally attacking anyone they perceived to be a Communist. In 1955 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] managed to hunt them down and placed them in suspended animation. The 1950s Captain America and Bucky would be revived years later after the return of Steve Rogers, going on another rampage, and would be defeated by the man they had modeled themselves after. (''Captain America'' #153, September 1972).

Monroe was eventually cured of his insanity and took up the superhero identity of [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], an identity that Rogers himself had once taken, even teaming up with the original Captain America on a number of occasions. At one point during his solo career, Monroe was injured severely enough to need to be placed in stasis once again. He was revived and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] (who was in turn being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]). Monroe was then forced to become the new [[Scourge of the Underworld]] and sent to kill the reformed supervillain team known as the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Monroe eventually broke free of the conditioning, helped the Thunderbolts to defeat Gyrich, and then disappeared (''Thunderbolts'' #35-#50, 1999-2001). When last seen, he had been shot by an unknown assailant and dumped in the trunk of a car (''Captain America'' Vol. 5 #3, April 2005).

For a brief time after Rogers awakened in the modern age, perennial Marvel sidekick '''[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]''' also donned the Bucky costume in an attempt to make himself Captain America's partner. However, Rogers was still wracked with guilt over the original Bucky's death, and refused to make this a permanent arrangement although Jones was insistent that Rogers should finally put the tragedy behind him. When the role of Captain America was taken over by John Walker, he formed the Bold Urban Commandos (BUCkies) as a backup team. Walker's main partner was African-American '''Lemar Hoskins''', who used the name "Bucky" until he realized the racist connotations of the alias when applied to him. Other persons who have used the Bucky alias include an unnamed baby that Nomad looked after for a period and '''Rikki Barnes''', who was from the alternate Earth created by [[Franklin Richards]] in the wake of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] incident. Rikki Barnes is still a member of the [[Young Allies]] on Counter-Earth.

In the [[Young Avengers]], team leader [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] wears a Bucky costume.

==Winter Soldier==

In recent issues of ''Captain America'', it was revealed that Bucky may well be alive. 

During the story, certain revelations about Bucky were revealed.  For one, Bucky's official status as Captain America's sidekick was a cover up.  In reality, he was an operative trained to do things regular soldiers and Captain America could not do, like sneak behind enemy lines and assassinate certain officials.  Also, the night before the famous incident with Zemo, the madman and his troops tortured Bucky while Captain America was forced to watch.  During the plane bombing that "killed" Bucky, his arm was pinned to the plane, which goes against how Captain America remembered it, who thought Bucky simply chose not to jump off.  This is supposed to establish the reason for the Winter Soldier's biomechanical arm.  

According to the file on the Winter Soldier, after the plane exploded Bucky's body (minus an arm) was found by General Vasily Karpov and the crew of a Russian sub which was patrolling the waters at the time. Buckyâ€™s body was revived in Moscow, though as a result of the explosion he suffered from  brain damage and amnesia. 

Bucky was reprogrammed, indoctrinated in the ways of the USSR, and trained to be even more of a fighting machine than he was when before. Given the name the '''Winter Soldier''',  Bucky was sent on various missions, becoming ruthless and efficient, killing in the name of the state. The only sign of reluctance in Bucky was in America in the 70s; after killing his target, Bucky suffered a breakdown and went missing for days. 

Bucky was kept in stasis when he wasn't on missions, and a result, he has only aged a few years since Captain America last saw him in World War II. 

In the present he alerted the attention of [[Captain America]] when he killed the [[Red Skull]] and Jack Monroe (Nomad) under orders from former Soviet general Alexander Lukin (who Karpov had mentored).  His objective was to retrieve the [[Cosmic Cube]] for Lukin and to play mind games with his former American partner.  He followed both of these when he lauched a terrorist attack on [[Philadelphia, PA]] which killed hundreds of people and powered the Cube.

Bucky kidnapped [[Sharon Carter]], and when Captain America rescued her she told him that she caught a glimpse of the Soldier, and that he looked like Bucky. Captain America was in denial at first, even after [[Nick Fury]] confirmed it, though after reading the file he seems to believe it too.

==Powers and abilities==
The original Bucky Barnes was trained by Captain America in hand-to-hand fighting techniques as well as being skilled in the use of military weapons such as firearms and grenades. He also used throwing knives on occasion and was a gifted advance scout.

Of the various Buckys, only Monroe and Hoskins had augmented strength and reflexes. Fred Davis, Rick Jones and Rikki Barnes were merely highly skilled in acrobatic fighting techniques. The baby Bucky did not have any training to speak of.

==Bucky Barnes in [[Ultimates]]==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reboot, Captain America had a sidekick, Bucky Barnes. This Bucky was a childhood friend of Steve Rogers who accompanied him on his missions as an Army press photographer. Surviving the war and believing Rogers had died during his last mission, Bucky eventually married Rogers' fiancÃ©e Gail. Barnes and Gail both lived long enough to see Rogers' revival in the 21st century and renewed their friendship with him.

==Notability==
Bucky was notable as one of the few [[comic book deaths]] that stuck.  A frequent aphorism among comic book fans, known as the [[Bucky Clause]], is that "No one in comics stays dead except Bucky, [[Jason Todd]], and [[Uncle Ben]]." With Bucky's return in the pages of Captain America v5 #6 (June 2005) and Jason Todd also returning, this saying has been sarcastically amended to "Absolutely no one in comics stays dead."
Bucky's death is also the explanation used as to why the Marvel Universe has very few kid sidekicks, as no respectable hero wanted to endanger a minor in that way after he died.
