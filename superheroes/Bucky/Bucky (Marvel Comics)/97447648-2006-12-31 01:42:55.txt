'''Bucky''' is the name of several [[fictional character|fictional]] masked [[hero|heroes]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. The original, '''James Buchanan Barnes''', was created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] as a [[sidekick]] character in ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]].

==History==
===Origin and World War II===
Barnes (named after [[James Buchanan]], the 15th [[President of the United States]], and the only president to be an acrobat, hence the homage) was an orphan, the son of a soldier killed in training at Camp Lehigh just before the United States' entry into [[World War II]]. As a result, he was unofficially adopted by the camp as a mascot. Nicknamed "Bucky," he took to wearing a uniform and becoming savvy with the ins and outs of military life, even though he was a teenager. It was at Lehigh that he met and befriended Private Steven Rogers, who by all appearances was the clumsiest soldier in the camp. This was at the same time that reports of the then-mysterious [[Captain America]] began to appear in news magazines, and Barnes eagerly devoured the accounts of this new hero.

One night, however, he looked into Rogers' tent and saw that his friend was changing into the uniform of Captain America. Barnes made a deal to keep the secret of Rogers' [[secret identity|dual identity]] if he could become his [[sidekick]]. Rogers agreed and trained Barnes appropriately. Together, Captain America and Bucky fought [[Nazism|Nazis]] both at home and abroad, as a duo and as part of the superhero team known as the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Barnes also teamed up with the sidekicks of other heroes in a group called the [[Young Allies]]. Additionally, Bucky was [[retconned]] in 1976 as the organizer of the [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] [[World War II]] superteam  the [[Liberty Legion]], set between the formations of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and the post-war [[All-Winners Squad]].

In the closing days of World War II in 1945, Captain America and Bucky tried to stop the villainous [[Baron Zemo]] from destroying an experimental [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone plane]]. Zemo launched the plane with an armed explosive device on it, with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit. They reached the plane just before it took off. Bucky unsuccessfully tried to defuse the bomb, and it exploded in mid-air. The young man was apparently killed, and Rogers was hurled into the freezing waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. Rogers' body, preserved in [[suspended animation]] in a block of ice, would only be found decades later by [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] (''The Avengers'' #4, March 1964).

==Legacy==
===Late-WWII and post-war Bucky===
Fearing that the deaths of Captain America and Bucky, if revealed, would be a blow to morale, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] asked William Nasland, the hero known as the [[Spirit of '76 (comics)|Spirit of '76]] (a member of the [[Crusaders (comics)|Crusaders]]), to assume the identity of Captain America. Assisting him was '''Fred Davis''', a former bat-boy for the [[New York Yankees]], who had posed as Bucky in 1942. The new Captain America and Bucky finished the rest of the war and continued to fight crime with the [[All-Winners Squad]]. Nasland was killed in 1946 fighting the [[android]] Adam II, and Captain America's identity passed to Jeff Mace, the [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] (''What If'' #4, August 1977).

Davis assisted Mace until 1948, when he was shot and wounded, forcing him to retire and leaving him with a permanent limp. In 1951, Davis joined the [[V-Battalion]], a secret organization that hunted [[war crimes|war criminals]], and eventually became one of its leaders on the Penance Council. He served the V-Battalion in both a leadership role in the Penance Council, and as an engineer. (''Captain America Comics'' #66, 1948; ''Citizen V and the V-Battalion'' #1-#4, 2001).

===1950s Bucky===
In 1953, an orphan named '''Jack Monroe''', who idolized Captain America and Bucky, discovered that his history teacher also had a similar passion, to the extent of undergoing plastic surgery to make him look like Steve Rogers and assuming his name as well. In addition, [[Grand Director|"Rogers"]] had discovered, in some old Nazi files stored in a warehouse in [[Germany]], the lost formula for the Super-Soldier serum that had given Captain America his abilities. The two used the serum and began to fight [[Communism|Communists]] as Captain America and Bucky (''Young Men'' #24, Dec. 1953).

Unfortunately, "Rogers" and Monroe were unaware of the stabilizing "Vita-Ray" process used on the original Captain America. As a result, despite their bodies being enhanced to peak human efficiency, they slowly grew [[paranoia|paranoid]] and dangerously insane. By the middle of 1954 they were irrationally attacking anyone they perceived to be a Communist. In 1955 the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] managed to hunt them down and placed them in suspended animation. The 1950s Captain America and Bucky would be revived years later after the return of Steve Rogers, going on another rampage, and would be defeated by the man they had modeled themselves after (''Captain America'' #153, September 1972).

===Nomad===
{{Main|Nomad (comics)}}
Monroe was eventually cured of his insanity and took up the superhero identity of [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], an identity that Rogers himself had once taken in the 70s (when he discarded Cap's mantle as a consequence of the Marvel-version of the [[Watergate Scandal]], engineered by the [[Secret Empire]]), even teaming up with the original Captain America on a number of occasions. At one point during his solo career, Monroe was injured severely enough to need to be placed in stasis once again. He was revived and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] (who was in turn being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]]). Monroe was then forced to become the new [[Scourge of the Underworld]] and sent to kill the reformed supervillain team known as the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Monroe eventually broke free of the conditioning, helped the Thunderbolts to defeat Gyrich, and then disappeared (''Thunderbolts'' #35-#50, 1999-2001). When last seen, he had been shot by the Winter Soldier and dumped in the trunk of a car (''Captain America'' Vol. 5, #3, April 2005).

===Rick Jones===
For a brief time after Rogers awakened in the modern age, perennial Marvel sidekick '''[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]''' also donned the Bucky costume in an attempt to make himself Captain America's partner. However, Rogers was still wracked with guilt over the original Bucky's death, and refused to make this a permanent arrangement although Jones was insistent that Rogers should finally put the tragedy behind him.

===Others===
When the role of Captain America was taken over by [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]], he formed the Bold Urban Commandos (BUCkies) as a backup team. Walker's main partner was African-American '''Lemar Hoskins''', who used the name "Bucky" until he realized the racist connotations of the alias when applied to him, and assumed the name "[[Battle Star (comics)|Battlestar]]".  Other persons who have used the Bucky alias include an unnamed baby that Nomad looked after for a period and '''Rikki Barnes''', who was from the alternate Earth created by [[Franklin Richards]] in the wake of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] incident. Rikki Barnes is still a member of the [[Young Allies]] on Counter-Earth. In the [[Young Avengers]], team leader [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] wears a Bucky costume.

==Winter Soldier==
[[Image:CAPA011 covcol.jpg|The Winter Soldier in the cover to ''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #11 (Nov. 2005), by Steve Epting.|thumb|200px]]
{{spoilers}}

In 2005 issues of ''Captain America'', series writer [[Ed Brubaker]] returned Bucky from his seeming death near the end of World War II.  He additionally revealed that Barnes' official status as Captain America's sidekick was a cover-up.  In reality, Barnes began as a 16-year-old operative trained to do things regular soldiers and the 20- to 21-year-old Captain America normally would not do, such as conduct covert assassinations.  The night before the infamous incident with Zemo, the villain and his troops tortured Barnes while Captain America was forced to watch.  During the drone-plane explosion that had apparently killed Barnes, the young man's arm was pinned to the plane — at odds with Captain America's memory of Bucky choosing to stay with the drone and attempt to defuse it.  This is presented as a rationale for the Winter Soldier's biomechanical arm.  

According to the file on the Winter Soldier, after the plane exploded, a cold-preserved body (minus an arm) was found by General Vasily Karpov and the crew of a Russian patrol sub.  The recovered young man was revived in Moscow, though as a result of the explosion, he suffered brain damage and amnesia.

Programmed to be a Soviet assassin, he was given the code name the '''Winter Soldier''' and sent on covert missions through the years, becoming increasingly ruthless and efficient as he killed in the name of the state.  The Winter Soldier's only sign of reluctance was in America in the 1970s; after killing his target, he suffered a breakdown and went missing for days. 

The Winter Soldier was kept in stasis when not on missions, and as a result has aged only a few years since the closing days of World War II. 

In the present day, the Winter Soldier caught the attention of Captain America when the Soldier killed the [[Red Skull]] and Jack Monroe (Nomad) under orders from former Soviet general [[Aleksander Lukin]] (Karpov's former protege).  The Soldier's objectives were to retrieve the [[Cosmic Cube]] for Lukin and to play mind games with Captain America.  He followed both orders, launching a terrorist attack on [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The attack killed hundreds of people, charged the Cosmic Cube, and gave Captain America his first visual of the Winter Soldier.

The Winter Soldier kidnapped [[Sharon Carter]], and when Captain America rescued her, she told him she caught a glimpse of the Soldier and that he looked like Bucky. [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] confirmed the Winter Soldier's existence, but could not ascertain his identity.

When Lukin grew paranoid over the power of the Cosmic Cube, the Winter Soldier was ordered to bury the Cube in an underground facility in [[West Virginia]].  With help from [[Iron Man]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], Captain America tracked down both the Soldier and the Cube and prepared for a confrontation.

[[Image:Wsoldier9.jpg|Captain America with the Winter Soldier, after the latter has recovered his memories.|thumb|left|290px]]

Upon making it to the facility, Captain America fought the Winter Soldier, but urgently tried to make him remember his past as Bucky.  Eventually, Captain America was able to gain the Cosmic Cube and told him to "remember who you are".  Regaining all his memories, the Soldier became overcome with guilt over his actions, took back the Cosmic Cube, and teleported himself to his and Steve Rogers' old Army base, where he broke down and cried.

After the concluding issue was released, Brubaker confirmed in an interview that he intended no loophole involving Captain America using the Cosmic Cube to restore the Winter Soldier's memories: 

::'''''Newsarama''''': "But playing devil’s advocate — asking the Cosmic Cube to help you is very "monkey's paw" at best ... the Winter Soldier could have been, in reality, someone named Comrade Pitor Nikoli, created just to demoralize Cap, but with him wishing it to be so with the Cube, couldn't Cap just have willed the Winter Soldier to be Bucky, and so he was?"

::'''''Brubaker''''': "That wasn't how I looked at it.  Look at what he said — "Remember who you are".  He didn't say, "Become who I think you are".  Or, "Be Bucky".  It was very straightforward.  Which is more the tragedy, since Bucky immediately has this immense guilt for everything he did as the Winter Soldier."

In ''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'' #38 (March 2006), [[Silver Samurai]] revealed/suggested that he believed the Winter Soldier helped Wolverine escape from the [[Weapon X]] facility years before when Wolverine first had [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] grafted to his skeleton.  Later it was revealed that the Winter Soldier may have killed Wolverine's wife and unborn baby.

In Captain America #18, the Winter Soldier is seen in London, knocking out a mugger who stole a woman's purse, and reading a newspaper that mentions the arrival of Lukin in one week.  Captain America later says he's convinced The Winter Soldier is out to kill Lukin.

Giving his aid to Captain America to fend off a terrorist attack in [[London]] brought by the new [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]] and a Deathbot, the Winter Soldier badly damages his robotic appendage. Apparently retiring his vengeful intentions for a while, he asks Nick Fury for employment and new equipment. Winter Soldier infiltrates a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility and injects a ''nano-trojan'' into one of the [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Fury, allowing him to observe what happens inside S.H.I.E.L.D. He then learns from one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s computer that Lukin has visited the [[Latveria|Latverian]] embassy, but is stopped from acting instantly by Nick Fury promising that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s satellites aren't the only ones watching Lukin.

==Powers and abilities==
The original Bucky Barnes was trained by Captain America in hand-to-hand fighting techniques as well as being skilled in the use of military weapons such as firearms and grenades. He also used throwing knives on occasion and was a gifted advance scout.

As the Winter Soldier, Barnes has superhuman strength and reaction time in his cybernetic left arm. In issue #16, he used the arm to take down a spider machine that was terrorizing Pilsburg, Iowa.

Of the various Buckys, only Monroe and Hoskins had augmented strength and reflexes. Fred Davis, Rick Jones and Rikki Barnes were merely highly skilled in acrobatic fighting techniques. The baby Bucky obviously had no training.

==Alternate versions==
===U.S. War Machine (Marvel MAX)===
In the [[Marvel MAX]] series ''[[War Machine|U.S. War Machine]]'', Bucky was serving in the present as [[Captain America]], as the Captain had died in his stead in World War II.  Bucky was accompanied here by two assistants, [[Hawkeye]] and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], neither wearing a costume and both addressed by their real names.

===Ultimate Bucky===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Captain America had a sidekick, Bucky Barnes. This Bucky was a childhood friend of Steve Rogers who accompanied him on his missions as an Army press photographer. Surviving the war and believing Rogers had died during his last mission, Bucky eventually married Rogers's fiancée Gail. Barnes and Gail both lived long enough to see Rogers's revival in the 21st century and renewed their friendship with him.

===What If?===
For the 2005 ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' event, the Captain America story featured Steve Rogers' commanding officer, Major Buchanan, who the men called "Bucky".  His mercenary tendencies led to Rogers' desertion, and when he later intervened in Rogers' transformation into Captain America, his face was destroyed, turning him into an undead being known as the White Skull.

==In other media==
The Winter Soldier recently appeared in the video game [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]].

Ultimate Bucky appeared in the movie [[Ultimate Avengers]].

==Notability==
Bucky used to be notable as one of the few [[comic book deaths]] that stuck. A frequent aphorism among comic book fans, known as the Bucky Clause, was that "No one in comics stays dead except Bucky, [[Jason Todd]], and [[Uncle Ben]]."[http://www.passfailstudios.com/index.php?id=27] Ironically, all three have recently been brought back to life in their respective universes, though Uncle Ben lasted for only a short time.

Bucky's death has also been used to explain why the Marvel Universe has very few kid sidekicks, as no responsible hero wanted to endanger a minor in similar fashion. Stan Lee also harboured a well-known dislike for boy sidekicks in general.{{fact}}

[[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne]] also considered bringing Bucky back, before deciding against it.[http://byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#16]

During [[Peter David]]'s run of [[The Incredible Hulk]], he created a group of immortals called the Pantheon. Their leader, Agamemnon, was assumed by some fans to be Bucky, because of his simlar appearance, eternal youth, and the statement that he'd lost his memory in an explosion. However, this may have been merely an homage on David's part.
