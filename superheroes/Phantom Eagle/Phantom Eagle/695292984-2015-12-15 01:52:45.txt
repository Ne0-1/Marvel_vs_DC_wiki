The Phantom Eagle was teenager Mickey Malone, who, though forbidden by superior officer Sergeant Flogg at his military [[airbase]] in Great Britain, was determined to fight the [[World War II]] [[Axis powers]]. Donning an aviator-styled [[costume]] and building his own airplane, he takes the name Phantom Eagle and becomes a secret ace. He later forms the Phoenix Squadron, a group of fellow teen pilots. During the post-war period, Malone formed a charter airline and searched for the Golden Chalice, a lost artifact upon which is inscribed the "Formula for Peace".

===Publication history===
The second Phantom Eagle was an unrelated [[World War I]] hero created by writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #16 (Sept. 1968).<ref name=gcd /><ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 131|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Aviation buff Herb Trimpe, who flew his own biplane for many years, teamed up with writer Gary Friedrich to create flying ace the Phantom Eagle.}}</ref> As Trimpe described, Marvel production manager [[John Verpoorten]] "had been a classmate at [[School of Visual Arts|SVA]].

He said they were hiring freelance people, and I should come up to the office and show my work to [[Sol Brodsky]], who was [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]'s]] right-hand man at the time. I said, 'Okay'. Later, while I was in the [[photostat]] department, I did the Phantom Eagle freelance, the first book I penciled.

'''Note:''' Per the [[Grand Comics Database]], Trimpe had actually made his professional penciling debut with two [[Kid Colt]] Western stories, in ''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #134–135 (May & July 1967).</ref>

Trimpe in 2002 described the character's creation:
{{quote|[T]he Phantom Eagle was primarily Gary Friedrich's idea. He knew I was interested in airplanes and that kind of stuff, so he came up with this wacko idea that became the Phantom Eagle. However, I could not quite justify this Americanized version of some sort of WWI combat ace. ... There was too much of a superhero in the character. If you know anything of that time in history or the feel of that time, you would know that it was just so wrong. But it was fun and I got to make up some of the airplanes. ... [T]he Phantom Eagle airplanes were all made up, and not patterned after a real airplane, but an original design by me. ... It had a kind of corny design pattern painted on it, like wings and that kind of stuff, which was not that far from what the pilots painted on their planes. But that character was what [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Gene Autry]] were to the American [[Western fiction|Western]] – totally Hollywoodized.<ref name=tart>{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=1593 |title=Hulk-inued!

The character has made few appearances beyond his debut. The first was a [[time travel]] story in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #135 (Jan. 1971). Next came a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] appearance in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]''  #12 (June 1975), in which the Phantom Eagle, as the cover proclaimed, was a real phantom. ''[[The Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #7 (July 1976) [[retconned]] the character as a member of the [[Freedom's Five]], a newly created World War I team of costumed adventurers never subsequently seen. The Phantom Eagle also appeared for two panels in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Corps]]'' #3 (Nov. 1993), when the antagonist briefly alters reality.<ref name=gcd />

''Ghost Rider''  #50 (Nov. 1980) contains a page of pinup art by Trimpe that one historian speculates<ref>[http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=34844#4 ''Ghost Rider'' #50] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> may have been an unused cover of issue #12.

===Fictional character biography===
In 1914, Karl Kaufman was a skilled American pilot from [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]], Wisconsin, whose German parents had returned to their native country. Kaufman had become an expert stunt-pilot and co-owner of a flying circus, by 1917, when the United States entered [[World War I]], and desired to fight the [[Central Powers]]. Concealing his identity so as not to risk reprisals against his parents, he devised a stylized aviator uniform with darkened goggles and a cape, and joined the European conflict to become an ace on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] as a U.S. Army Air Corps test pilot. In his first mission as Phantom Eagle, he successfully led a U.S. fighter squadron against an experimental dirigible aircraft carrier with which German forces attempted to invade New York; however, he witnessed the death of his best friend, Rex Griffin, as a result.<ref>''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #16</ref> At one point the time-traveling dictator [[Kang the Conqueror]] sent the simpleminded brute the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] back to 1917 in an effort to secure a victory for Germany, by preventing the Phantom Eagle from destroying a key German super-weapon.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #135</ref> Another time, a brief altering of reality saw the Phantom Eagle's [[biplane]] pursued by modern [[jet fighter]]s.<ref>''Thor Corps'' #3 (Nov. 1993)</ref>

The Phantom Eagle went on to join the team of costumed adventurers known as [[Freedom's Five]], consisting of himself (the sole American), the [[Crimson Cavalier]], the [[Silver Squire]], [[Sir Steel]], and [[Union Jack (comics)#Union Jack (James Montgomery)|Union Jack]].<ref>recounted in ''Invaders'' #7</ref>

Kaufman and his parents were later killed together near the end of the war by German pilot Hermann von Reitberger, who strafed both the Phantom Eagle and the two civilians with his machine guns as they fled from Germany into Alsace, France. Swearing vengeance, the Phantom Eagle's spirit haunted and hunted von Reitberger through the years until, after a chance, modern-day encounter with the original [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], he battled the aged German in aerial combat. With von Reitberger's death, Kaufman's [[vengeful spirit]] was allowed to pass on.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #12 (June 1975)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The Phantom Eagle was a normal man with no superhuman powers. He possessed good hand-to-hand fighting skills, and was an expert stunt-flyer and combat pilot. He customized his own World War I vintage biplane.
