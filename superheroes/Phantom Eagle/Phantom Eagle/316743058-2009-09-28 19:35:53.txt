===Publication history===
The first Phantom Eagle was introduced by un-credited creators in Fawcett Comics' ''[[Wow Comics]]'' #6 (July 1942). Following his debut, the Golden Age Phantom Eagle appeared in every issue of ''Wow'' through the final issue, #69 (August 1948). His primary [[writer]]-[[artist]] was [[Marc Swayze]].

===Fictional character biography===
The Phantom Eagle was teenager Mickey Malone, who, though forbidden by superior officer Sergeant Flogg at his [[military]] [[airbase]] in [[Great Britain]], was determined to fight the [[World War II]] [[Axis powers]]. Donning an aviator-styled [[costume]] and building his own [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]], he takes the name Phantom Eagle and becomes a secret ace. He later forms the Phoenix Squadron, a group of fellow teen pilots.

===Publication history===
The second Phantom Eagle was an unrelated [[World War I]] hero created by writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #16 (Sept. 1968). As Trimpe described, Marvel production manger [[John Verpoorten]] "had been a classmate at [[School of Visual Arts|SVA]]. When I got out of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in October 1966, he worked in the production department at Marvel. He said they were hiring freelance people, and I should come up to the office and show my work to [[Sol Brodsky]], who was [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]'s]] right-hand man at the time. I said, 'Okay'. Later, while I was in the [[photostat]] department, I did the Phantom Eagle freelance, the first book I penciled. I think".<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/jonhulkholt/trimpe.interview.1.html Green Skin's Grab-Bag: "An Interview with Herb Trimpe" (no date)]. '''Note:''' Trimpe had actually made his professional penciling debut with two [[Kid Colt]] Western stories, in ''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #134-135 (May & July 1967).</ref>

The character has made few appearances beyond his debut. The first was a [[time travel]] story in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' #135 (Jan. 1971). Next came a [[flashback]] appearance in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]''  #12 (June 1975), in which the Phantom Eagle, as the cover proclaimed, was a real phantom. ''[[The Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #7 (July 1976) [[retconned]] the character as a member of the [[Freedom's Five]], a newly created WWI team of costumed adventurers never subsequently seen. The Phantom Eagle also appeared for two panels in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Corps]]'' #3 (Nov. 1993), when the antagonist briefly alters reality.

''Ghost Rider''  #50 (Nov. 1980) contains a page of pinup art by Trimpe that one historian speculates<ref>[http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=34844#4 Grand Comics Database: ''Ghost Rider'' #50]</ref> may have been an unused cover of issue #12.

===Fictional character biography===
In 1914, Karl Kaufman was a skilled American pilot from [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], whose [[Germany|German]] parents had returned to their native country. Kaufman had become an expert stunt-pilot and co-owner of a flying circus, by 1917, when the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]], and desired to fight the [[Central Powers]]. Concealing his identity so as not to risk reprisals against his parents, he devised a stylized aviator uniform with darkened goggles and a cape, and joined the European conflict to become an ace on the side of the [[Allies]] as a U.S. Army Air Corps test pilot. In his first mission as Phantom Eagle, he successfully led a U.S. fighter squadron against an experimental dirigible aircraft carrier with which German forces attempted to invade New York; however, he witnessed the death of his best friend, Rex Griffin, as a result.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 1 #16</ref> At one point the time-traveling dictator [[Kang the Conqueror]] sent the simpleminded brute the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] back to 1917 in an effort to secure a victory for Germany, by preventing the Phantom Eagle from destroying a key German super-weapon.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #135</ref> Another time, a brief altering of reality saw the Phantom Eagle's [[biplane]] pursued by modern [[jet fighter]]s.<ref>''Thor Corps'' #3 (Nov. 1993)</ref>

The Phantom Eagle went on to join the team of costumed adventurers known as [[Freedom's Five]], consisting of himself (the sole American), the [[Crimson Cavalier]], the [[Silver Squire]], [[Sir Steel]], and [[Union Jack (comics)#Union Jack (James Montgomery)|Union Jack]].<ref>recounted in ''Invaders'' #7</ref>

Kaufman and his parents were later killed together near the end of the war by German pilot Hermann von Reitberger, who strafed both the Phantom Eagle and the two civilians with his machine guns as they fled from Germany into Alsace, France. Swearing vengeance, the Phantom Eagle's spirit haunted and hunted von Reitberger through the years until, after a chance, modern-day encounter with the original [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], he battled the aged German in aerial combat. With von Reitberger's death, Kaufman's vengeful spirit was allowed to pass on.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #12 (June 1975)</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The Phantom Eagle was a normal man with no superhuman powers. He possessed good hand-to-hand fighting skills, and was an expert stunt-flyer and combat pilot. He customized his own World War I vintage biplane.

===Other versions===
====Counter-Earth Phantom Eagle====
An issue of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' revealed another Phantom Eagle existing in the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], located on the far side of the sun. He is the counterpart to our Earth's [[Nefarius|Lloyd Bloch]], a.k.a. Nefarius, and lost his Moonstone to [[Moonstone (comics)|Karla Sofen]], a.k.a. Moonstone, when the reformed-supervillain team the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] were stranded on Counter-Earth.

====MAX====
Writer [[Garth Ennis]] and penciller-inker [[Howard Chaykin]] produced an [[alternate-reality]] version of the character in a [[World War I]]-set miniseries, ''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War is Hell: The First Flight of the Phantom Eagle]]'' #1-5 (May-Sept. 2008), published under Marvel's mature-audience [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=142228 Nick Lowe on Marvel Max's ''War is Hell'' series], [[Newsarama]], January 7, 2008</ref> <ref name=PW021908>Laura Hudson, [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6533463.html Ennis Moves from Punisher to Phantom Eagle], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', February 19, 2008.</ref>
