'''Coldblood''' ('''Eric Savin''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]] who first appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' vol. 1 #26 (August 1989).

==Fictional character biography==
While still a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army at Camp Killian, '''Eric Savin''' was put in charge of Project: Ultra-Tech. There he met the love of his life, Lieutenant Gina Dyson. While on patrol, Savin stepped onto a freshly planted mine which blew him into pieces. He was dead for 2.3 minutes. Gina immediately performed cybernetic surgery on him. The surgery was successful â€” Savin was alive, but resurrected as a cyborg by [[Mako (comics)|Mako]]'s Project: Ultra-Tech. Dyson, his former lover, aided him in battling Mako and his robots, and apparently slew Mako in combat.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #26-35</ref> The "7" in Coldblood's original name was stated to be a mere wordplay on Coldblood's real name "Eric Savin", as his surname is pronounced in the same way.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Coldblood became an urban soldier cyborg, operating as a freelance mercenary. He evaded capture by [[Mechadoom]].<ref>''Deathlok'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> Coldblood hunted down and fought the third [[Deathlok#Michael Collins|Deathlok]] in Paris. He then joined forces with Deathlok and [[Siege (John Kelly)|Siege]] in defeating [[Harlan Ryker]] and his cyber-warriors.<ref>''Deathlok'' Vol. 2 #18-21</ref>

Coldblood gave in to his cyborg-form at one point but with the help of Gina was brought back to the human side in him.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

In later missions, Coldblood was hired by [[Roxxon Oil]] and had to get a stolen biochemical weapon back from the lab of Dr. Jonathan Cayre. Coldblood gained the help of the original [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] team and succeeded in his mission.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Again later, Savin worked together with fellow cyborg [[Deathlok]], [[Silver Sable]] and her [[Wildpack (comics)|Wildpack]] against the villain group [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
Eric Savin was converted into the cyborg Coldblood-7 by Dr. Gina Dyson and other Project: Ultra-Tech surgeons following designs by Mako. This gave him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability, and enhanced sensory systems. Coldblood also has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system, and, by mentally entering "cyberspace," to communicate with such systems. He has a wetware-grafted computer grafted to his organic brain, a plasti-steel-reinforced skeleton, an artificial heart, synthetic hemoglobin, and artificial right eye, and artificial limbs. The right half of his face is an armored cybernetic implant. The organic portion of Coldblood's body still requires food, drink, oxygen and sleep. His in-built computer requires a recharge of electricity every twelve months of active service. The portion of Coldblood's organic brain that controls personal memories was removed during surgery that made him into a cyborg.

Coldblood wears body armor and uses conventional firearms, including a .357 automatic gun implanted in his artificial left hand.  Mako and Project: Ultra-Tech also specially designed a high speed automobile for him, with built-in guns, which can be remote controlled by a device in Coldblood's left wrist.

Coldblood is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, highly trained in commando fighting, and is a superb marksman with conventional firearms.
