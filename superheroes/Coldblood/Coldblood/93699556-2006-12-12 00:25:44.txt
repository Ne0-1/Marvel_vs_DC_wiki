'''Coldblood (Eric Savin)''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]] who first appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' (1st series) #26 (August 1989).

==Fictional character biography==
While still a Colonel Lieutenant at Camp Killian, '''Eric Savin''' was put in charge of Project: Ultra-Tech. There he met the love of his life, Lieutenant Gina Dyson. While on patrol, Savin stepped onto a freshly planted mine which blew him into pieces. He was dead for 2.3 minutes. Gina immediately performed cybernetic surgery on him. The surgery was successful - Savin was alive, but a cyborg. He even gave into his cyborg-form but with the help of Gina was brought back to the human side in him.

In later missions, Coldblood was hired by [[Roxxon Oil]] and had to get a stolen biochemical weapon back from the lab of Dr. Jonathan Cayre. Coldblood gained the help of the original [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] team and succeeded in his mission. Again later, Savin worked together with fellow cyborg [[Deathlok]], [[Silver Sable]] and her [[Wildpack (comics)|Wildpack]] against the villain group Ultimatum.

===Civil War===

When next seen, Coldblood was one of the many super-heroes against the registration act forged during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event, and was arrested. He was transported to a super-prison called "Fantasy Island", built within the [[Negative Zone]].

==Trivia==
* The "7" in Coldblood's original name was stated to be a mere wordplay on Coldblood's real name "Eric Savin", as his surname is pronounced in the same way.
