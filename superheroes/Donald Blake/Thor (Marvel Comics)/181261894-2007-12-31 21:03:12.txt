'''Thor''' (often called '''The Mighty Thor''') is a [[superhero]] appearing in the {{Marvel Universe}}.  Based on the god of the [[Thor|same name]] from [[Nordic mythology]] and created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]''  #83 (Aug. 1962). The uncredited initial inker was [[Joe Sinnott]].<ref name="sinnot">Per [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/MTALES2.HTM#S2 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators], "On the letter page of ''Thor'' (I) #433, [[Ron Frenz]] claims that this story was inked by Joe Sinnott; confirmed by [Sinnot's son,] Mark Sinnott".</ref>

==Publication history==
Writer-editor Stan Lee described Thor's genesis as following the creation of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]: 
{{cquote|[H]ow do you make someone stronger than the strongest human? It finally came to me: Don't make him human &mdash; make him a god. I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods. It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends.... Besides, I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old, with the flowing beards, horned helmets, and battle clubs. &nbsp;...''Journey into Mystery'', needed a shot in the arm, so I picked Thor ... to headline the book. After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind, I asked my brother, Larry, to write the script because I didn't have time. ...[A]nd it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby....<ref name="excel">''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'' (Fireside, 2002; ISBN 0-684-87305-2), by Lee and George Mair}</ref>}}

Following Thor's debut in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', the 13-page feature "The Mighty Thor" continued to be plotted by Lee but scripted by Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] or [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (working under the pseudonym "R. Berns"). Penciling was by either Jack Kirby, [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Don Heck]], or, for a single issue, [[Al Hartley]]. Then with ''Journey into Mystery'' #101 (Feb. 1964), the series began a long and definitive run by Lee and Kirby that lasted until the by-then-retitled ''The Mighty Thor'' #179 (Aug. 1970). 

The five-page featurette "Tales of Asgard" was added in ''Journey into Mystery'' # 97 (Oct. 1963) followed by "The Mighty Thor"<!--not yet official title of comic, so not ital--> becoming the dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later. 
[[Image:Jim083.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 (Aug. 1962): Thor's debut. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].<ref name="sinnot" />]] 
''Journey into Mystery'' was retitled ''The Mighty Thor'' with issue #126 (March 1966). "Tales of Asgard" was replaced by a five-page featurette starring the "[[Inhumans|The Inhumans]]", from #146–152 (Nov. 1967 – May 1968), after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories reverted to Marvel's then-standard 20-page length.

Once Kirby left the book, [[John Buscema]] and [[Neal Adams]] each drew a few issues. Buscema became the regular artist with issue #182 (Nov. 1970) and continued to draw the book almost without interruption until #278 (Dec. 1978). 

Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left, and during Buscema's long stint on the book, the stories were mostly written by [[Gerry Conway]], [[Len Wein]] or [[Roy Thomas]]. Thomas continued to write the book after Buscema's departure, working much of the time with the artist [[Keith Pollard]], but for several years ''The Mighty Thor'' had a changing creative team. 

[[Walt Simonson]] took over both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). He introduced many popular characters, such as [[Beta Ray Bill]], in a popular and critically acclaimed run.<ref>[http://www.popimage.com/reviews/071001thorsimonsonrev.html Review of a trade paperback collecting some of Simonson's run at PopImage.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=2189 Essay on what makes certain stories definitive at Silver bullet Comics.]</ref>

After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, [[Tom DeFalco]], became the writer. Working primarily with artist [[Ron Frenz]], DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).

As a consequence of the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event of the 1990s, Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and, with many other Marvel characters, reimagined in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] for one year. His series' title reverted to ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' with issue #503 (Nov. 1996), and ran four different, sequential features ("The Lost Gods", "[[Shang Chi|Master of Kung Fu]]", "[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]", and "[[Hannibal King]]") before ceasing publication with #521 (June 1998).

When Thor and the other heroes returned to the [[Marvel Universe]], the 85-issue ''Thor'' vol. 2 was launched, premiering with #1 (July 1998). This series began using dual numbering, as if the original Thor series had continued unbroken, with issue #36 / #538 (June 2001). (At the time, the Marvel Comics series begun in the 1960s, such as ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', were given such dual numbering on the front cover, with the present-day volume's numbering alongside the numbering from the original series.) [[Dan Jurgens]] was writer for a majority of this series' run, leaving with issue #79 (July 2004). [[Scot G. Eaton]] joined him, as penciler, on #68-79. They were followed by co-writers [[Daniel Berman]] and [[Michael Avon Oeming]] and penciler-inker [[Andrea Di Vito]] for the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" crossover storyline through the final issue #85 / #587 (Dec. 2004)

A new Thor ongoing series, ''Thor'' vol. 3, written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[Olivier Coipel]], premiered with a first issue cover-dated Sept. 2007.

==Fictional character biography==
The Marvel version of Thor is noble and very self-assured, sometimes to the point of arrogance. Odin decides his son needs to be taught humility and consequently places Thor (without memories of godhood) into the body and memories of an existing, partially disabled human medical student, Donald Blake. After becoming a doctor and thoroughly believing himself to be the young surgeon Blake, he later discovers Thor's disguised hammer and learns to change back and forth into the Thunder God. The real Blake's persona remains elsewhere until many years later, after Odin becomes satisfied of Thor's humility and lifts the spell, thereby removing the need for a mortal alter ego. The mortal experience, however, shapes Thor into an honorable and courteous individual, who is loyal to all comrades.

===Protector of Midgard===
Being the son of the Elder Goddess [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]], Thor has a natural affinity for Earth and feels obliged to protect the mortals that occupy it. Thor's time on Earth is marked by battles against [[supervillain]]s, monsters, cosmic beings and even other gods. 

Thor's principal foe is his adopted brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who has hated Thor since childhood. While a master of magic with power that dwarfs even that of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]],<ref>''Strange Tales'' #123 (Aug. 1964)</ref> Loki prefers to employ the use of minions in his battle against Thor. Ever the schemer, Loki is cautious not to be seen to be directly involved for fear of angering [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]. To that end, Loki creates two ubiquitous foes of Thor — the [[Absorbing Man]] and the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]]. Loki also tricks others into fighting on his behalf, such as the Asgardian troll [[Ulik]], the [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris Wolf]], the dragon [[Fafnir (Marvel Comics)|Fafnir]] and the [[Silver Surfer]].

Sometimes, however, Loki overreaches himself and faces disaster. Guiding a mortal to the shrine of the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] — which then absorbs the mortal's essence and battles Thor — almost proves fatal for Loki, as Odin became aware of the conflict and promises that should Thor perish, the trickster god would quickly follow. On another occasion, Loki uses the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as a lure to draw Thor out; while this proved successful, it resulted in the formation of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], of which Thor is a founding and longstanding member.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963)</ref>

Thor's other mortal foes include the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]; [[Grey Gargoyle]] and [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], but among his most powerful foes are the Asgardian monsters as [[Mangog]], the Frost Giants, the [[Enchanters Three]], the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]] and the fire-demon [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]]. Thor's gallery of mystical/cosmic rogues extends to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Thanos]], the [[God Eater (comics)|God Eater]], the [[Dark Gods (comics)|Dark Gods]], the Sh'iar Praetor [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]], and the god-slayer [[Desak]]. Thor has even fought against the combined might of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], when their Fourth Host arrived to judge Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #300</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
Once again attempting to thwart Ragnarok, Odin attempted to trick the world-ash tree Yggdrasil into believing that Ragnarok had already happened. To do so, the Asgardians were to be transformed into mortals so that they would not be recognized as gods. Odin intended that Thor would restore the Asgardians to normal, but Seth accidentally prematurely activated the plan. Compounding the situation, Thor, along with other heroes, disappeared battling the powerful [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and wound up on the new Counter-Earth created by [[Franklin Richards]]. By the time Thor returned to Earth, the Asgardians had managed to regain their identities, but were then captured by the Dark Gods. Ultimately, Thor rescued his people from the Dark Gods with the aid of Hercules and the Destroyer. 

After a paramedic named Jake Olson was slain during a battle between the Avengers and the Destroyer, Marnot, a servant of Odin, gave Thor Olson's form as a new identity. Although Thor could assume Olson's form, he had none of Olson's memories and thus found this identity to be troublesome for him. He also re-encountered Jane Foster while in this identity, and brief sparks were rekindled between them. Odin finally separated Olson from Thor, and Olson was allowed to return to his own life. 

[[Image:Thor55.jpg|thumb|left|''Thor'' vol. 2, #55 (July 2000). Cover art by [[Tom Raney]].]]
===The Reigning=== 
Much of the second volume of the title deals with the consequences of Thor's decision to intervene in the affairs of Earth.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #41-85 (Nov. 2001 - Dec. 2004)</ref> After reluctantly assuming the throne of Asgard, Thor sees mortals at their worst and reshapes the world in his image. 

A nightmarish future follows as Thor and the Asgardians conquer Earth and slay or imprison those who oppose them, including a young religious mutant called Davis; [[Zarrko|Zarrko the Tomorrow Man]]; [[Perrikus]] of the Dark Gods; the U.S. Government, and even his fellow Avengers. He marries Amora, the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and has a son, [[Magni (comics)|Magni]]. 

Wracked with guilt, Thor is eventually drawn into a final battle with Tarene and a Desak-occupied Destroyer in a [[Time travel|time-travel]] bid to undo what he has done. As soon as the timeline is reset, Loki revives Surtur, who forges new uru hammers for Loki's Storm Giant followers and begins Ragnarok, a.k.a. Götterdämmerung or "the twilight of the gods".

Thor learns that the Ragnarok cycle is the result of self-styled "gods to the gods" known as Those Who Sit Above in Shadow, who feed on the cycle. Thor confronts the [[Norns (Marvel Comics)|Norns]] (Fates), breaking the Ragnarok cycle, and then enters a self-induced state of non-existence, sleeping "the sleep of the gods." With his fate unknown to the Avengers, he is believed to be missing in action.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 2004). Alternately number #587</ref>

===Civil War===
Two years later and just prior to the events of [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] is found on Earth and put under U.S. Army protection. Six months later, [[Doctor Doom]] - who escapes from Hell as Mjolnir falls through that dimensional plane - tries unsuccessfully to claim the hammer. The hammer is later claimed by a mysterious man carrying a bag with the initials "D.B".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' # 536</ref> During a battle between the two Civil War superhero factions, "Thor" appears and kills [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]].<ref>''Civil War'' #4 (October 2006)</ref> This version of Thor is later revealed to be a fusion of cloning technology and cybernetics created by [[Reed Richards]] and [[Henry Pym]]. Anti-registration heroes Storm and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] destroy the clone in a final battle between the factions. <ref>''Civil War'' #7 (2007)</ref> The remains of the clone are currently stored in the laboratories at [[Camp Hammond]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 (2007)</ref>

===New beginning===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:THORV2007POST VAR.jpg|thumb|Promotional art for ''Thor'' vol 3, #7 (scheduled for 2008), by [[Olivier Coipel]].]] -->
The mysterious man seen during the events of ''Civil War'' is Donald Blake. When Blake touches the hammer [[Mjolnir]], he is transported to the void where Thor has been in [[hibernation]]. Blake explains that when [[Odin]] originally removed the Donald Blake persona from Thor,<ref>''Thor'' #340 (Feb. 1984)</ref> Blake was transported to the void Thor now inhabits, and was returned to [[New York City]] when Thor broke the [[Ragnarok]] cycle. Blake convinces Thor to wield Mjolnir once more and return to Earth and renew the dual identity with Blake. Blake also reveals that Thor's fellow Asgardians are not dead but hidden on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

Thor rebuilds Asgard in [[Oklahoma]] and after paying for the land with Asgardian treasure, seeks his fellow Asgardians.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #2 (Oct. 2007)</ref> Thor learns of the events of the superhero-registration "Civil War" and is angered that Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]) waged war on the heroes who had been their friends, and is also angered that Stark and others used his DNA to create the Thor Clone without his knowledge or permission. Thor defeats Iron Man in a confrontation, and states he will respond with greater aggression unless left in peace. Seeking a compromise, Stark rationalizes that Asgard may be considered a foreign [[embassy]], with [[diplomatic immunity]] granted to its inhabitants. Thor deems this acceptable, and allows Stark to leave, but not before warning him that matters between them are far from settled. Soon after he finds the first of the lost Asgardians, [[Heimdall (Marvel Comics)|Heimdall]], in New Orleans, Louisiana and restores him to his true form.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #3 (Oct. 2007)</ref>

Donald Blake is then called to Africa to assist colleague Dr. Ernest Lereaux in treating local tribes. Blake becomes Thor and in addition to separating two warring tribes (by opening a chasm between the tribes) also restores the [[Warriors Three]] to their true forms.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #4 (Nov. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thor is the Norse god of thunder and lightning. Like all Asgardians, Thor is not truly immortal but relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of [[Idunn (comics)|Idun]] to sustain his lifespan, which to date has lasted many millennia. The strongest of the Norse gods, Thor has performed feats such as lifting a portion of the World Serpent,<ref>''Thor'' #379</ref> hurling the Odinsword, an enormous mystical blade, through a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]],<ref>''Thor'' #300</ref> and matching other beings of enormous strength, such as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] <ref>''Journey Into Mystery''  #112 (Jan. 1965)</ref> and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Thor Annual'' #1 (1965)</ref> If pressed in battle, Thor is capable of entering into a state known as the "Warrior's Madness", which will temporarily increase his strength tenfold.<ref>''Thor'' vol.1, #166; ''Thor'' vol.1, #502; ''Incredible Hulk'' vol.2, #440</ref> He also possesses virtually inexhaustible godly stamina, high resistance to physical injury (eg. rocketfire) <ref>''Thor'' vol.1, #309</ref> and superhuman speed and reflexes.

Thor is a superb hand-to-hand combatant and has mastered a number of weapons such as the war hammer, sword, and mace. He is also very cunning and intuitive in battle, with many centuries of experience. Thor possesses two items that assist him in combat: the Belt of Strength, and his mystical hammer Mjolnir. The former item doubles his strength,<ref>First mentioned in ''Journey Into Mystery''  #91 </ref> while the second is used for flight; weather control; energy projection and absorption; dimensional apertures; matter manipulation, as well as the most powerful of his offensives: the God Blast,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #12</ref> and the Anti-Force. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #25</ref>

After his resurrection, Thor has accepted his heritage as a child of the Elder Goddess Gaea, and has demonstrated the ability to create country-spanning chasms in the Earth itself. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #4 (Nov. 2007)</ref>

After Odin's death, Thor inherited his father's power, the Odinforce. Thor was then capable of feats such as reconstructing the Earth's Moon,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #57</ref> willing the Asgardian monster [[Mangog]] into nothingness <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84</ref> and by focusing his entire power into a hammer throw even decapitated a [[Desak]]-occupied [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, 47 - 50</ref> Thor later briefly acquired mastery of the Runes, and a level of enlightenment that allowed him to free Asgard from the eternal cycle of Ragnarok, becoming even more powerful than his father.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #83-#85</ref>
