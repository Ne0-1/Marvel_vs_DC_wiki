'''Thor''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] who appears in publications published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character [[First appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]''  #83 (Aug. 1962) and was created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller [[Jack Kirby]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character is based on the [[Thor]] of [[Norse mythology]]. He has starred in several ongoing series and [[limited series]], and has been a perennial member of the [[superhero]] team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], appearing in each of the four volumes. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[clothing]]; [[toy]]s; [[trading cards]] and [[video game]]s.

A [[Thor (film)|self-titled film]] based on the character and comic is scheduled to be released in May 2011, with [[Kenneth Branagh]] as director and [[Chris Hemsworth]] starring as Thor. Hemsworth is also contracted to reappear as Thor in the film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', set to be released in 2012.

==Publication history==
Writer-editor Stan Lee described Thor's genesis, following after the creation of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]:{{bquote|"[H]ow do you make someone stronger than the strongest person? It finally came to me: Don't make him human &mdash; make him a god. I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods. It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends... Besides, I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old, with the flowing beards, horned helmets, and battle clubs. &nbsp;...''Journey into Mystery'' needed a shot in the arm, so I picked Thor ... to headline the book. After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind, I asked my brother, Larry, to write the script because I didn't have time. ...and it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby..."<ref name="excel">''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'' (Fireside, 2002; ISBN 0-684-87305-2), by Lee and George Mair)</ref>}}

Following Thor's debut in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', the 13-page feature "The Mighty Thor" continued to be plotted by Lee but scripted by Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] or [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (working under the pseudonym "R. Berns"). Penciling was by various artists, including Jack Kirby; [[Joe Sinnott]]; [[Don Heck]] and [[Al Hartley]]. With ''Journey into Mystery'' #101 (Feb. 1964), the series began a long and definitive run by Lee and Kirby that lasted until the by-then-retitled ''Thor'' a.k.a. ''The Mighty Thor'' #179 (Aug. 1970).<ref name=uhmcc>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/thor.htm#S145 "Thor (I) • The Mighty Thor (I) (1966-1996)"] at the Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: "Series is named 'Thor' in the indicia, but most covers have the title 'The Mighty Thor'."</ref>

The five-page featurette "Tales of Asgard" was added in ''Journey into Mystery'' #97 (Oct. 1963) followed by "The Mighty Thor"<!--not yet official title of comic, so not ital--> becoming the dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later.

''Journey into Mystery'' was retitled ''Thor'' (per the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]]), a.k.a. ''The Mighty Thor'' (per most covers)<ref name=uhmcc /> with issue #126 (March 1966). "Tales of Asgard" was replaced by a five-page featurette starring "[[Inhumans|The Inhumans]]", from #146–152 (Nov. 1967 – May 1968), after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories reverted to Marvel's then-standard 20-page length.

After Kirby left the title, [[Neal Adams]] penciled issues #180-181 (Sept.-Oct. 1970) before [[John Buscema]] then became the regular artist the following issue. Buscema continued to draw the book almost without interruption until #278 (Dec. 1978). Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left, and during Buscema's long stint on the book, the stories were mostly written by [[Gerry Conway]], [[Len Wein]], or [[Roy Thomas]]. Thomas continued to write the book after Buscema's departure, working much of the time with the artist [[Keith Pollard]]; during this period Thomas integrated many elements of traditional Norse mythology into the title, with specific stories translated into comics form.<ref>Such as the [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of Nibelung]] saga, in ''Thor'' issues #293–297 (March–July 1980).</ref> Following Thomas's tenure, for several years ''Thor'' had a changing creative team.

[[Walt Simonson]] took over both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson was responsible for introducing the character [[Beta Ray Bill]], in what was regarded as a popular and critically acclaimed run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popimage.com/reviews/071001thorsimonsonrev.html |title=Review of a trade paperback collecting some of Simonson's run at |publisher=Popimage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=2189 |title=Essay on what makes certain stories definitive at Silver bullet Comics |publisher=Silverbulletcomics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>

After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, [[Tom DeFalco]], became the writer. Working primarily with artist [[Ron Frenz]], DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).

As a consequence of the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event of the 1990s, Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and with other Marvel characters re-imagined in an [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universe]] for one year. The ''Thor'' title reverted to ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' with issue #503 (Nov. 1996), and ran four different, sequential features ("The Lost Gods"; "[[Shang-Chi|Master of Kung Fu]]"; "[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]" and "[[Hannibal King]]") before ceasing publication with #521 (June 1998).

When the character was returned to the mainstream Marvel Universe, Thor was relaunched in a second volume, and debuted as ''Thor'' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998). As of issue #36, the title used dual numbering in a tribute to the original Thor series, and the caption box for said issue became #36 / #538 (June 2001). The title ran until issue #85/#587, dated December 2004. [[Dan Jurgens]] wrote the first 79 issues, with Daniel Berman and [[Michael Avon Oeming]] completing the series.

The third volume dedicated to Thor's adventures debuted as ''Thor'' #1 (Sept. 2007), initially written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[Olivier Coipel]].<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/thor6.htm#S7413 "''Thor'' (III) (2007-2009)"] at the Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref> In January 2009, beginning with what would have been issue vol. 3, #13 the third volume reverted to issue #600, reflecting the total number of published issues from all three volumes.<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/thor9.htm#S9185N600 "Thor (I) cont.

[[Image:Jim083.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 (Aug. 1962): the debut of ''Thor''. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
Thor's father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] decides his son needs to be taught humility and consequently places Thor (without memories of godhood) into the body and memories of an existing, partially disabled human medical student, Donald Blake.<ref>Revealed in flashback in ''Thor'' Annual #11 (Jan. 1983)</ref> After becoming a doctor and on holiday in [[Norway]], Blake witnesses the arrival of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] scouting party. Blake flees into a cave after they hear him and begin pursuing him, and after discovering Thor's disguised hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], and striking it against a rock, transforms into the thunder god.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #83 (Aug. 1962)</ref>

Defeating the aliens, Thor shares a double life with his [[alter ego]]: treating the ill in a private practice with nurse - and eventual love - [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] and defending humanity from evil. Thor's presence on Earth almost immediately attracts the attention of his stepbrother and arch-foe [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #85 (Oct. 1962)</ref> who returns repeatedly to Earth in a bid to destroy Thor.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #88 (Jan. 1963); #91-92 (April–May 1963)</ref> Loki is also responsible for the emergence of three of Thor's principal foes: the [[Absorbing Man]];<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]],<ref>''Thor'' #148 (Jan. 1968)</ref> and the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #118 (July 1965)</ref> On one occasion, Loki's tactics are accidentally beneficial - although successful in using an illusion of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to draw Thor into battle, it results in the formation of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], of which Thor is a founding and longstanding member.<ref>''Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963)</ref>

Falling in love with Jane Foster, Thor disobeys his father and refuses to return to Asgard, an act for which he is punished on several occasions.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #101 (Feb. 1964); #113 (Feb. 1965); #145 (Oct. 1967)</ref> Thor's natural affinity for Earth is also eventually revealed to be due to the fact that he is the son of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Goddess]] [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]].<ref name="Thor #300 October 1980">''Thor'' #300 (Oct. 1980)</ref> Although Thor initially regarded himself as a "superhero" like his teammates in the Avengers,<ref name="Thor #300 October 1980"/> Loki's machinations draw Thor into increasingly epic adventures, such as teaming with father Odin and [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] ally [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]] against fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] and Skagg the Storm Giant,<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #104 (May 1964)</ref> and defeating an increasingly powerful Absorbing Man and proving his innocence in the "Trial of the Gods".<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #114-123 (March-Dec. 1965)</ref> This necessitates an extended leave of absence from the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref>

[[File:Cover of Thor 3-1.jpg|thumb|right|Thor on the cover of the first issue of volume three showing his redesigned look by [[Oliver Coipel]].]]
When Odin dies in battle against Surtur, Thor becomes ruler of Asgard. The thunder god extends his rule to Earth, with major repercussions. Thor and the Asgardians slay or imprison those who oppose them, including a young religious mutant called Davis; Zarrko the Tomorrow Man; [[Perrikus]] of the Dark Gods; the [[U.S. Government]], and even his fellow Avengers. Thor marries Amora (the Enchantress), and has a son, [[Magni (Marvel Comics)|Magni]], who on reaching adulthood doubts his father's judgment. Wracked with guilt, Thor is drawn into battle with his former ally [[Thor Girl|Tarene]] and the Destroyer (occupied by former foe [[Desak]]), and undoes the timeline via [[time travel]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #41-79 (Nov. 2001 - July 2004)</ref>

When the timeline is reset, Loki revives Surtur, who forges new uru hammers for Loki's Storm Giant followers and begins Ragnarök. Thor learns that Ragnarok is the result of the self-styled "gods to the gods" known as '''Those Who Sit Above in Shadow''', who feed on the cycle. Thor confronts the [[Norns (Marvel Comics)|Norns]] (Fates), and severs the tapestry of Asgard's existence. After breaking the Ragnarok cycle and being advised by the Odinforce that this was his father's plan, Thor enters into [[hibernation]]. With his fate unknown to the Avengers, he is believed to be missing in action.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #80-85 (Aug.-Dec. 2004)</ref>

Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] is eventually found on Earth and put under [[U.S. Army]] protection. When the supervillain [[Doctor Doom]] escapes from Hell, Mjolnir falls through the dimensional plane, and Doom tries unsuccessfully to lift the hammer. Mjolnir then  comes into the possession of a man carrying a bag with the initials "D.B".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #536 (May 2006)</ref> Donald Blake, upon touching the hammer Mjolnir, is transported to the void of non-existence in which Thor now resides.

When Thor entered that void, Blake was suddenly restored to being in [[New York City]]. Blake convinces Thor to wield Mjolnir once more, return to Earth, and renew the dual identity with Blake. Blake also reveals that Thor's fellow Asgardians are actually not dead but hidden on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Asgardians, Thor is not truly immortal but relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of [[Idunn (Marvel Comics)|Idunn]] to sustain his extended lifespan, which to date has lasted many [[millennia]]. Being the son of Odin and the elder goddess Gaea, Thor is physically the strongest of the Asgardians, and has performed such feats as almost lifting the entire World Serpent<ref>''Thor'' #272 (June 1978)</ref> (stated to encircle the [[Earth]] multiple times)<ref>''Thor'' #379 (May 1987)</ref> knocking out the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] with a single blow,<ref>''Thor'' #178</ref> crumbling uru to dust,<ref name="Journey into Mystery #94">''Journey into Mystery'' #94</ref> breaking the Silver Surfer's force field with a single blow,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #4</ref> and hurling the [[Odinsword]], an enormous mystical blade of incalculable weight, through a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]].<ref name="Thor #300 October 1980"/> If pressed in battle, Thor is also capable of entering into a state known as the "[[berserker|Warrior's Madness]]" ("berserksgangr" in Norse), which will temporarily increase his strength and stamina tenfold, although in this state he attacks friend and foe alike.<ref>''Thor'' #166 (July 1969); ''Hulk''#440 (April 1996); ''Thor'' #502 (Sept. 1996)</ref> In the Warriors Madness he struck Beta Ray Bill with enough force to destroy the planet they were on.<ref>''Thor'' #468</ref> He has shown the power to telepathically communicate with Odin while in the form of Don Blake.<ref name="Journey into Mystery #89">''Journey into Mystery'' #89</ref>

Thor also possesses a very high resistance to physical injury that approaches invulnerability; (e.g. he can withstand rocket fire;<ref>''Thor'' #309 (July 1981)</ref> intense cold and heat;<ref>''Avengers'' #14</ref> falls from orbital heights<ref>''Thor'' #324 (Oct. 1982)</ref> and the gravity of a neutron star<ref>''Thor'' #282  (April 1979)</ref>) keen senses ("super-breath");<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #85 (Oct. 1962)</ref> the ability to travel through time;<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #86</ref><ref>Various.

However, exceptionally powerful magic , like [[Dormammu]]'s, can overwhelm the enchantment that transforms him between Asgardian and mortal forms.<ref>''Defenders'' vol.1 #11 (December 1973)</ref>

As the Norse god of Thunder, Thor can summon the elements of the storm (lightning; rain; wind; snow) and uses Mjolnir as a tool to focus this ability, although the hammer cannot command artificial weather, only natural. He can cause these weather effects all over the world and destroy entire buildings; by whirling his hammer he can also lift entire buildings with the wind.<ref name="Journey into Mystery #94"/> As the son of the Earth goddess Gaea, Thor has shown some [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Earth manipulation|control over the Earth]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #4 (Nov. 2007)</ref>

Thor is a superb hand-to-hand combatant, and also skilled in armed combat, excelling in the use of the [[war hammer]], [[sword]] and [[Mace (club)|mace]]. Thor possesses two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his mystical hammer Mjolnir. The first item doubles Thor's strength and endurance<ref>''Journey into Mystery''  #91 (April 1963)</ref> while the second is used to control his weather abilities; flight; energy projection and absorption; dimensional travel; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast (which taps into Thor's life force and has driven back a weakened [[Galactus]]),<ref>''Thor'' vol.1, #160-161 (Jan.-Feb. 1969; ''Thor'' #388 (Feb. 1988); ''Thor'' vol. 2, #25 (July 2003)</ref> the Thermo-blast (which has challenged [[Ego the Living Planet]]),<ref>''Thor'' #133</ref> and the Anti-Force (which counteracts another force).<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #12 (June 1999)</ref> Using Mjolnir, Thor can also travel at [[supersonic]] speeds in Earth's atmosphere and travel [[faster than light]] in space. Thor also uses a [[chariot]] drawn by two huge mystical goats called Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder.<ref>''Thor'' #364-366 (Feb.-April 1986)</ref> He can throw an object out of Earth's atmosphere using his strength,<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #90</ref> and throw his hammer to Asgard from where it will return.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #85</ref>

After Odin's death, Thor inherited his father's power, the Odinforce. Thor becomes capable of feats such as reconstructing the Earth's Moon,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #57 (Feb. 2003)</ref> willing the Asgardian monster [[Mangog]] into nothingness,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84 (Nov. 2004)</ref> and, by focusing his entire power into a hammer throw, decapitating a [[Desak]]-occupied [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #79 (July 2004)</ref> Thor also acquires mastery of the Runes, and a level of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] that allows him to free Asgard from the eternal cycle of Ragnarok.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #83-85 (Oct.-Dec. 2004)</ref>

When Mjolnir was damaged, the Odinforce was transferred by Doctor Strange from Thor to the hammer, as Strange claims the power is required to restore it. However, doing so has also bound Thor's own life force into Mjolnir, meaning that if the hammer were to be broken again, Thor may also die.<ref name="Thor602"/>

There are several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] versions of Thor.

In the limited series ''[[Earth X]]'', Thor and the other [[Asgardians]] are members of a shapeshifting alien race, with forms and identities determined by the imagination of "Odin", a human Norse storyteller. Due to Loki's trickery, Thor is female in this universe.<ref>''Earth X'' #0 (March 1999); #0.5 (Jan. 2000); #1-13 (April 1999 - June 2000)</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Chad |last=Nevett |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/18/the-reread-reviews-earth-x/ |title=The Reread Reviews — Earth X |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 18, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref>

The limited series ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' is set in the 17th century, and a version of Thor appears with an alter ego of an elderly Christian monk named [[Marvel 1602 (characters)#Heroes|Donal]] — an allusion to Thor's original secret identity Donald Blake. Donal fears and despises his alter-ego, believing that summoning a non-Christian deity will damn him.<ref>''Marvel: 1602'' #1 - 8 (Nov. 2003 - June 2004)</ref>

The [[Marvel 2099]] title ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' reveals the role of Thor is taken by Cecil MacAdam, who belongs to a class of priests known as "Thorites" and worship the original version of Thor.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #15 (Jan. 1994)</ref>

As a result of the temporary "[[Age of Apocalypse]]", the title ''X-Universe'' #1 (May 1995) features a version of Donald Blake that never discovers he is the reincarnation of Thor, and is instead an agent of the Human High Council and a doctor, traveling with [[Gwen Stacy]] to provide aid in human refugee camps.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #1 (May 1995)</ref>
