'''Dr. Kavita Rao''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], associated with the [[X-Men]].  Dr. [[Rao]] is a world-renowned geneticist from [[India]] who developed a serum called Hope which could "cure" [[mutants]], turning them into "normal" humans.  

While hundreds of mutants immediately signed up for the procedure at Benetech, the corporate backer of her research, the X-Men debated the societal meaning of someone comparing mutation to disease.  Still, the chance at being "normal" weighed heavily on Hank McCoy (aka [[Beast]]) and he considered taking the serum.  It was later revealed that Rao worked for the alien [[Ord]] of the Breakworld who also had in his custody [[Colossus (comics)| Colossus]] who was, at that time, thought to be dead. The  X-Men defeated Ord and Benetech, and Ord was delivered into the hands of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].  Dr. Rao's work was destroyed by [[Wolverine]], leaving Hank with the last sample of "Hope".

When [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] was announced as the lastest cast member of the upcoming movie [[X-Men 3]], it was reported she would be playing Rao. Many supported the idea considering Shohreh is Middle Eastern and reports that the movie would revolve around the mutant cure. However in a interview with [[Entertainment Weekly]] Shohreh revealed that she would actually be playing [[Cecilia Reyes|Dr. Cecilia Reyes]], a [[Puerto Rican]] mutant who is a doctor in [[New York]] not Rao as first reported. Raph Winter, producer of all three movies, stated in a recent interview that Shohreh will play Kavita Rao.
