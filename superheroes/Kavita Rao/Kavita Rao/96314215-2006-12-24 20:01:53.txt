'''Dr. Kavita Rao''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in and featured prominently in the first story arc of [[Astonishing X-Men]] in 2005.

=="Hope" in Astonishing X-Men==
{{spoiler}}
Dr. [[Rao]] is a world-renowned geneticist from [[India]] who developed a serum (later called "Hope") which could "cure" [[mutant (fictional)|mutants]], turning them into normal humans.

Hundreds of mutants immediately signed up for the procedure at Benetech (the corporate backer of her research). The X-Men debated the merits of the cure and the significance of labelling the mutant condition a disease.  The chance at shedding his "beastly" appearance and avoiding any further secondary mutations held significant appeal for Hank McCoy (aka [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]) and he considered taking the serum.

It was later revealed that Rao had been working for the alien [[Ord (comics)|Ord]] of the Breakworld who also had in his custody [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] who was, at that time, thought to be dead. The X-Men defeated Ord and Benetech, and Ord was delivered into the hands of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Dr. Rao's work was destroyed by [[Wolverine]], leaving Hank with the last sample of "Hope".

{{spoiler}}
In the [[2006]] movie ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', Kavita Rao was played by Iranian-American actress [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]. This is despite claims made by Aghdashloo in an interview with [[Entertainment Weekly]] that she would be playing [[Cecilia Reyes|Dr. Cecilia Reyes]]. Raph Winter, producer of all three movies, subsequently stated that Aghdashloo would be playing Rao.

In the film (as in the comic), Rao is the inventor of the mutant cure, which she created with the [[DNA]] of [[Leech (comics)|Leech]].  Towards the end of the movie, she is killed by [[Quill (comics)|Quill]]
