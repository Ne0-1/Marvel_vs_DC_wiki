'''Shortpack''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[telepath]]ic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. His first appearance was in ''Mystique #3'', created by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and [[Jorge Lucas]].

==Biography==
Shortpack's mutation also came with a severe price: his body began shrinking at puberty. If not for the meditative exercises he learned from [[Professor X]], he likely would have shrunk to a microscopic size. Unfortunately for him, he cannot control his power to grow and shrink further, and so he remains about 8&nbsp;inches tall. Shortpack was recruited by Professor Charles Xavier to be a field handler for the clandestine operatives in his employ. Shortpack's first agent was [[Prudence Leighton]] (Agent 16), who was seemingly killed by the arms dealer [[Prudence Leighton|Steinbeck]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The next agent to be assigned to him was the former mutant terrorist/freedom fighter, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], but when the two met in [[Cuba]] for the first time, Shortpack did not know about her terrorist background. After handling Mystique on a few missions, Shortpack was contacted by the Quiet Man, who offered him a way to exact vengeance on Steinbeck for killing Prudence. He tried to get [[Fantomex]] to kill Steinbeck for him, but was refused, though Fantomex brought him to what he thought was Steinbeck's lair. Instead, Shortpack found that his target was his benefactor â€” the Quiet Man was Prudence's mind in Steinbeck's body, and the exchange had driven her mad. S/he captured Shortpack and used him as bait for Mystique, who had replaced her. Shortpack was eventually rescued by Mystique and presumably still works for Xavier.{{issue|date=December 2012}} It is unknown if Shortpack lost or retained his mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities==
Shortpack possesses short-range [[telepathy]]. Additionally, he is very small, about 8&nbsp;inches tall.
