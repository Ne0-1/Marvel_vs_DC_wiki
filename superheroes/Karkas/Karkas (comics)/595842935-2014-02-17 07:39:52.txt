Karkas was born in [[Lemuria (comics)#Deviant Lemuria|Deviant Lemuria]], too monstrous in appearance even by Deviant standards. He was made a slave, pitted in gladiatorial contests against others considered grotesque.  Another gladiator was [[Ransak the Reject]], who was considered hideous by the Deviants due to his normal human appearance (also interpretable as because he looked too much like an [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]]).  Karkas and the Reject were pitted against each other, in a bout viewed by the Eternal [[Thena]], in which Ransak bested Karkas. When [[Eson the Searcher|Eson]] the Celestial attacked, Karkas begged Thena for sanctuary with the Deviants' enemies, the Eternals.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #8</ref> Thena teleported both Karkas and Ransak away to [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #11-12</ref> With Thena and Ransak, Karkas battled Zakka and [[Tutinax]].<ref>''Eternals Annual'' #1</ref> Since then the two have become friends and reside primarily with the Eternals.
