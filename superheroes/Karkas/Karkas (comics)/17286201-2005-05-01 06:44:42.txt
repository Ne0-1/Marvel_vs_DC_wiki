'''Karkas''' is a character from the [[Marvel Universe]], a member of the [[Deviants]], a fictional off-shoot of humanity specific characterized by somewhat monstrous appearances. Karkas was too monstrous in appearance even by Deviant standards however, and was pitted in gladiatorial contests against others considered grotesque, including the individual known as the [[Reject (comics)|Reject]], who ironically has a fully human appearance.  Karkas and the Reject were pitted against each other, but have since become friends and been freed, joining the Deviants' enemies, the [[Eternals]], another off-shoot of Humanity that was, like the Deviants, created by the [[Celestials]].  Karkas is quite intelligent and artistic despite his appearance, and possesses a red hide that is exceptionally thick, making him highly resistant to injury.  He has only three fingers on each hand, pointed teeth and an oversized head.  

Karkas was created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]], in 1977.
