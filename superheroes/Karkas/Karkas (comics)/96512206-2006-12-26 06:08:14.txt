'''Karkas''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhuman]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Karkas is a member of the [[Deviants (comics)|Deviants]], a monstrous off-shoot of humanity created by the [[Celestials]]. Karkas was created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]], in 1977.

==Character biography==
Karkas was born too monstrous in appearance even by Deviant standards, and was pitted in gladiatorial contests against others considered grotesque.  Another gladiator was [[Ransak the Reject]], who ironically was considered hideous by the Deviants due to his normal human appearance (also interpretable as because he looked too much like an [[Eternals|Eternal]]).  Karkas and the Reject were pitted against each other, in a bout viewed by the Eternal [[Thena]]. When Eson the Celestial attacked, Karkas begged Thena for sanctuary with the Deviants' enemies, the [[Eternals]]. Thena teleported both Karkas and Ransak away.  Since then the two have become friends and reside primarily with the Eternals

==Powers and abilities==
Karkas is quite intelligent and artistic despite his appearance.  He has been described as having an [[eidetic memory]].  Karkas possesses a wrinkled red hide that is exceptionally thick, making him highly resistant to injury.  He has claw-like fingers on each hand, pointed teeth and an oversized head.  Karkas has been described as having six digits on each limb, but has been depicted with four [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/k/karkas.htm] or five [http://www.immortalthor.net/bio-karkas.html].
