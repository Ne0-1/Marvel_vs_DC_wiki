'''Hush''' (presumably a.k.a. '''Dr. Thomas Elliot''') is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]and ally of The Riddler who fights [[Batman]]. Created by writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and artist [[Jim Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman]]'' #608 (December 2002). Follwing his 12-issue debut arc, Hush resurfaced in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'', where he has appeared as a recurring villain since issue #50 (April 2004).

==Origin==
'''Thomas "Tommy" Elliot''' was a childhood friend of [[Bruce Wayne]].

Like Wayne, Elliot was born into a tremendously wealthy family. Unlike Wayne, though, Elliot had no loving relationship with his parents, whom he grew to resent while still a boy. Driven by his desire for independence, he cut the brakes on his parents' car, causing a crash that killed his father. His mother was saved by [[Dr. Thomas Wayne]], which secretly enraged young Elliot. His anger was fueled further by the murder of the Waynes, which put [[Bruce Wayne]] in just the situation Elliot had hoped to create for himself.

Although Elliot's mother later succumbed to [[cancer]], while he went on to become a successful surgeon, Elliot continued to hold his irrational grudge.  

At some point in his career, Elliot happened across Edward Nigma (a.k.a. the [[Riddler]]), who had managed to uncover that [[Batman]] was in fact [[Bruce Wayne]]. Discovering that they had a common foe, Elliot and Nigma decided to pool resources to bring down that foe. 

To this end, Elliot created for himself the persona of '''Hush'''.

==Inaugural Brawl==

In their attempt to destroy the [[Batman]], Hush and the [[Riddler]] manipulated several other villains to do their bidding. These included [[The Joker (comics)|The Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], Harvey "[[Two-Face]]" Dent, [[Poison Ivy]], [[Scarecrow (comics)|The Scarecrow]], [[Killer Croc]] and [[Clayface]]. [[Jason Todd]] (formerly Robin II), who was presumed dead at this point in time, apparently also joined up.

With these villains as their pawns, Hush and the [[Riddler]] set up an elaborate plot against the [[Batman]], which included Elliot faking his own death (''[[Batman]]'' #613) and making [[Batman]] believe Jason Todd had returned to destroy him (''[[Batman]]'' #617/18).

[[Catwoman]] came to Batman's aid during this period, and the two finally gave in to their mutual attraction. 

When Hush finally revealed himself to a worn-out [[Batman]], the Dark Knight was saved only by the intervention of Harvey "[[Two-Face]]" Dent, who had secretly returned to the side of the law and alerted former police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to the going-ons. Dent wound up shooting Hush twice, knocking him off a bridge and into the raging current below. 

Although [[Batman]] felt certain that Hush indeed was Thomas Elliot, the Dark Knight regretted the fact that he'd never had the chance to actually unmask the villain.

==Hush Returns==

When Hush resurfaced, he did so with a vengeance. Still out to destroy [[Batman]] and determined not to let the rest of the villains get in his way, Hush quickly began to carve out a niche for himself, beating his former accomplice, the [[Riddler]], to a bloody pulp and even driving [[The Joker]] out of town. Hush also ended up killing [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] in a fruitless attempt to recruit her.

Following a short-lived alliance with JLA nemesis [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]], Hush has now begun to torment [[Bruce Wayne]] with the aid of an all-new [[Clayface]]. Exploiting the latter's shape-shifting abilities, Hush was briefly able to shed doubt on his true identity and apparently also had [[Bruce Wayne]]'s butler [[Alfred (comics)|Alfred]] framed for murder.
