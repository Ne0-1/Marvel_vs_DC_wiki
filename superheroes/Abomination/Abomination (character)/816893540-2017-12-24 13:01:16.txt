==Publication history==
[[Stan Lee]] chose the name "the Abomination", which he realized belonged to no other character, before conceiving the character's background and appearance. Lee recalled that he simply told the artist [[Gil Kane]] to "make him bigger and stronger than the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and we'll have a lot of fun with him."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Tim Lammers |title=Stan Lee Pumped Over Return Of 'Incredible Hulk' |work=[[KCRA-TV]] |date=2008-06-11 |url=http://www.kcra.com/entertainment/16574962/detail.html |accessdate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013230843/http://www.kcra.com/entertainment/16574962/detail.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}</ref>

Emil Blonsky first appeared in the title ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', and was introduced as a [[KGB]] agent and spy<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=8}}</ref> who became the Abomination after deliberately exposing himself to a greater quantity of the same [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] that transformed Bruce Banner into his [[alter ego]] the Hulk, using a machine Banner was planning on using to commit suicide. In his first appearance, Blonsky became a large scaly humanoid even stronger than the Hulk. In accordance with Lee's wishes, the character defeated the Hulk in their first battle.<ref name="Astonish' 1967">''Tales to Astonish'' #90 - 91 (April - May 1967)</ref>

The character has been featured in a number of Marvel titles, gradually shifting from unthinking savage brute,<ref name="Astonish' 1967"/> to master schemer,<ref name="Thor #178 July 1970">''Thor'' #178 (July 1970)</ref> to tortured soul,<ref name="Hulk' 1991">''Hulk'' #382 - 384 (June - Aug. 1991)</ref> and finally repentant villain and occasional defender of the weak<ref>''Hulk'' #431 -432 (July - Aug. 1995)</ref> before being killed in battle.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #1 - 2 (Feb. - March 2008)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Emil Blonsky was born in [[Zagreb]] (then part of Yugoslavia) and became a KGB agent who was sent to an Air Force Base in New Mexico to photograph equipment when he bombarded himself with a much higher dose of gamma radiation and transforms for the first time when Bruce Banner walks in and is nearly killed. The Hulk is revived by [[General officer|General]] [[Thunderbolt Ross]] using radioactive rays. The Hulk eventually reverts to Banner, who lures the Abomination into a trap and drains off the Abomination's excess power, allowing the Hulk to defeat him. The entire encounter is observed by the cosmic entity the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], who encountered the Hulk in the previous storyline when he planned to control his mind and use him to wipe out most of humanity so the survivors could build a better civilization, but was dissuaded from destroying the Earth by Banner's noble actions.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #89 (Apr. 1967)</ref> He takes the Abomination - judged to be evil - off world for further study.<ref name="Astonish' 1967"/>

The Abomination reappears when summoned by a [[coven]] of [[witchcraft|witches]] to briefly battle the cosmic hero the [[Silver Surfer]]<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #12 (Jan. 1970)</ref> and summons [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] (via an absent Stranger's technology) to aid him in escaping the Stranger's laboratory world. Thor frees the Abomination and the other captives, but, on discovering they are all evil, uses his mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] to [[time travel]] several hours into the past to undo his mistake. After defeating the Abomination and placing the Abomination in prison, Thor departs.<ref name="Thor  #178 July 1970"/> When the Hulk is defeated by the alien Xeron the Star Slayer (who is in [[New York City]] hunting a giant creature called [[Klaatu (comics)|Klaatu]]) and brought aboard a space vessel, the Abomination is revealed to be [[Chief Mate|first mate]] of the alien crew. When the captain of the vessel directs Xeron and the crew to battle Klaatu in space, the Hulk and the Abomination are thrown from the vessel and battle until the pair are drawn into Earth's [[orbit]] and separated.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #136 - 137 (Mar. - Apr. 1971)</ref>

It is revealed in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that the Abomination entered into a [[coma]] on impacting with the Earth and is buried for two years. Revived by an off-course [[missile]] fired from [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] Base (under Ross' jurisdiction), the Abomination joins forces with General Ross to defeat the Hulk, but is battered into submission by an angered Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' #159 (Jan. 1973)</ref> The Abomination reappears with fellow Hulk foe the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], and the pair activates a gamma bomb at the Hulkbuster base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. The Hulk's companion of the time, [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]], deactivates the bomb and the Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk''  #171 (Jan. 1974)</ref> A comatose Abomination is eventually found by soldiers at Ross' direction and has a miniature bomb implanted in his [[Human skull|skull]], being told to fight and defeat the Hulk or be killed. The Abomination tricks the Hulk into an alliance and betrays Ross by attempting to [[ransom]] the captured [[Kennedy Space Center]]. The plan fails when the Hulk turns on the Abomination and the pair fight, with the Abomination being caught on a [[rocket]] when it explodes.<ref>''Incredible Hulk''  #194 - 196 (Dec. 1975 - Feb. 1976)</ref>

An [[illusion]] of the Abomination also appears with other Hulk foes when the Hulk (at the time possessing the intelligence of Banner) enters the [[brain]] of [[Colonel]] [[Glenn Talbot]] at [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] size to [[:wikt:excision|excise]] a [[tumor]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #200 (June 1976)</ref>

The Abomination eventually reappears as a servant of the entity the [[Galaxy Master]], having been empowered with even greater strength. After another extended battle with the Hulk, the Hulk attacks and destroys the Galaxy Master, causing the villain to weaken and apparently become lost in [[outer space|space]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #270 (Apr. 1982)</ref> When Hulk foe [[MODOK]] invades the Hulkbuster base, he colludes with General Ross to revive the Abomination, who was found in a block of ice above Earth and kept in [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] storage for further study. MODOK intends to use the Abomination against his superiors at [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM)]], while Ross hopes the villain will destroy the Hulk. The Abomination, however, has become afraid of the Hulk and has to be mentally forced by MODOK to fight. MODOK, however, is ousted by AIM, and a hesitant Abomination is beaten by the Hulk when he intervenes to save Banner's laboratory assistant. The Abomination refuses to rejoin the fight, and is [[wikt:disintegrate|disintegrate]]d by MODOK.<ref>''Incredible  Hulk'' #287 - 290 (Sep. - Nov. 1983)</ref>

The Abomination is restored by the demonic entity [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who directs the Abomination and other villains against the [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #1 - 9 (July 1985 - Mar. 1986)</ref> The restoration is temporary as a still disembodied Abomination's particles mingle with the mind of the villain [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]], who reintegrates the Abomination under his control. Tyrannus as the Abomination then comes into conflict with the Gray Hulk, and quickly defeats the weaker version of the Hulk. When the Hulk reverts to Banner, Tyrannus forces him to create a procedure that will separate Blonsky, who is mentally fighting Tyrannus for control of the Abomination. The process is successful and Blonksy is restored to a human form, free of Tyrannus, still occupying the form of the Abomination. An enraged Gray Hulk defeats Tyrannus, who is placed into custody by the organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Annual #15 (Jan. 1986)</ref>

After encounters against [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[Wonder Man]]<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #25 (Oct. 1987)</ref> and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]],<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #12 (Nov. 1988)</ref> the Tyrannus-controlled Abomination reappears during the "[[Atlantis Attacks]]" storyline with [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Ghaur]] freeing Tyrannus from the body of the Abomination and placing Blonsky's mind within the creature once more. The process drives Blonksy insane, and he battles heroes [[Spider-Man]] and [[She-Hulk]], managing to knock both unconscious. The Abomination is eventually driven off when placed on fire by She-Hulk.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #23 (1989)</ref> The Abomination's mental faculties eventually return and the Abomination reappears in the "Countdown" storyline as a pawn of another Hulk foe, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. The Abomination is sent to a [[toxic waste]] site to collect samples, and encounters the gray version of the Hulk, who is outmatched and also weak due to being [[poison]]ed. The Hulk, however, throws the Abomination into toxic waste that partially dissolves the Abomination.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #364 - 367 (Dec. 1989 - Mar. 1990)</ref>

The Abomination temporarily teams with villains [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]] and [[Gargantua (comics)|Gargantua]]<ref>''Hulk'' Annual #19 (Jan. 1991)</ref> and finds and stalks his former wife, Nadia (a famous [[ballet]] dancer). The Abomination captures her and after taking her into the New York City sewers, reveals his true identity. After a brief skirmish, the Hulk persuades the Abomination to free his wife.<ref name="Hulk' 1991"/>
The Abomination is also captured by the [[robot]] [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] but eventually freed by the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[X-Men]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2, #6 - 8 (July; Oct & Dec. 1991)</ref>

After befriending a woman who finds her way into the sewers,<ref>''Hulk'' Annual #20 (Jan. 1994)</ref> the Abomination battles [[Namor]] during an attempt to save his kidnapped former wife.<ref>''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #58 - 59 (Jan. - Feb. 1995)</ref> The Abomination retaliates against the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] when the [[police commissioner]] orders the sewers be cleared of all homeless.

When [[Betty Ross]] dies in the title ''Hulk'', Banner mistakenly thinks her proximity to the Hulk has induced a fatal case of [[radiation poisoning]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #468 (Sep. 1998)</ref> Using a gamma device, a vindictive General Ross tracks what he believes to be the Hulk to a destroyed town, where the Abomination reveals he was the true culprit. Despite baiting a newly arrived Hulk, the Abomination is unable to force the Hulk to fight and departs.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #472 - 474 (Jan. - Mar. 1999)</ref>

The circumstances of Betty's death are eventually revealed: Blonksy's transformation into the Abomination apparently alienates his former wife Nadia, driving his hatred of Banner; Blonsky, deciding to deprive Banner of Betty in return, secretly [[poison]]s her with his radioactive blood. After hearing the Abomination's admission, Banner eventually discovers the truth and the Hulk defeats the Abomination in combat. Taken into custody by the military, Blonsky is forced to watch old [[home movies]] of him and his wife together (prior to his transformation) as punishment.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #24 - 25 (Mar. - Apr. 2001)</ref> Operatives from a secret organization "Home Base" eventually release the Abomination to battle the Hulk, and although able to taunt the Hulk about Betty's murder,  he is defeated once again.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #50 - 54 (Mar. - July 2003)</ref> This encounter is revealed to be a [[dream]] generated by longtime [[Doctor Strange]] foe [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in an effort to torture the Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3, #81 (July 2005)</ref>

[[Iron Man]] uses technology taken from Order of the Shield agents to teleport the Abomination into interplanetary space estimated to be "somewhere in the vicinity of [[Jupiter]]".<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 3 #3-4, June–July 2014)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Abomination is similar to the Hulk in terms of strength, stamina, speed and durability, and the ability to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]]. In contrast with the Hulk, he retains his intellect after transforming, and cannot change back into human form. He also possesses [[gill]]s, enabling underwater breathing; and, he can enter a state of [[suspended animation]] when bereft of [[oxygen]] for long periods. Originally, the Abomination is twice as strong as the Hulk, but unlike the Hulk his strength does not increase/decrease in proportion to level of anger, with the result that the Hulk is able to gain an advantage over Blonsky if the fight takes a sufficient amount of time for his anger to increase.

After being further empowered by Amatsu-Mikaboshi, the Abomination is considerably larger than before, can project hellfire and is strong enough to rip off the shell of his successor [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]] (something which the Red Hulk had previously been unable to do).<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #618; ''Incredible Hulk'' #619</ref> After his second resurrection by the Illuminati dubbed Order of the Shield, the cloned Abomination gains further augmentation through Banner's biological grafts. Abomination gains the ability to track the Hulk anywhere in the world at will.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 3 #2, May 2014</ref> Another feature is his ability to control his gamma radiation output in such a way that he can make it toxic to even the most resilient of individuals including energy absorbers such as Hulk, Captain Marvel and Sunspot.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 3 #4, July 2014</ref>
