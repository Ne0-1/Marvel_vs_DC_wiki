'''The Abomination (Emil Blonsky)''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]] and is a perennial foe of the [[Incredible Hulk]]. 

==Fictional character biography==

'''Emil Blonsky''' is a [[KGB]] agent who becomes the Abomination after deliberately exposing himself to the same [[gamma radiation]] (but in a greater quantity) that transforms [[Bruce Banner]] into the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Blonsky survives the radiation, as like Bruce Banner, he belongs to a small minority born with a genetic factor that caused them to mutate instead of die horribly. As a result, Blonsky is transformed into a massive green-skinned monster with physical strength exceeding even that of the Hulk.  In his first appearance, the Abomination is more than twice as powerful as a calm Hulk. While able to retain his mental faculties, Blonsky soon discovered that he is unable to return to human form.

Blaming his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk, Blonsky returns to attack his arch foe time and again. Although stronger than the Hulk in a calm state, the Abomination is almost always been beaten by the Hulk's sheer savagery. In later issues, it is revealed that Blonsky's transformation alienates his ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this drives Blonksy insane with hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grows incensed upon learning that Banner has married [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], the daughter of General [[Thunderbolt Ross]]. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky decides that Banner should also lose his spouse. The Abomination subsequently poisons Betty with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk has given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposes the Abomination's role in Betty's false death, and as the Hulk defeats him in combat. Banner then forgives the Abomination, who cannot accept this act. Blonsky finally realizes that he has been living a lie - it is he who is the monster, not the Hulk. 

Months later, the still-grieving General Ross manipulates the Hulk into attacking and almost killing the Abomination. The Abomination is then taken into custody by the military, and as punishment is forced to watch a film loop of himself and his wife prior to his transformation, making his incarceration a constant reminder of what he has lost.

Eventually, operatives from the secret organization Home Base release the Abomination in order to fight the Hulk. The Abomination has become even more vicious as a result of his incarceration, and reminds Banner of the loss of Betty to goad him into a violent response. The plan backfires as the Abomination faces an enraged Hulk, who utterly defeats him.

==Powers and abilities==

Blonsky's transformation into The Abomination substantially increases his strength and durability. The Abomination differs from the Hulk in three ways:

* He is unable to transform into human form. <ref>''Tales To Astonish'' vol. 1, #90</ref>

* While twice as strong as the Hulk in "calm" state, his strength does not increase. <ref>''Tales To Astonish'' vol. 1, #90</ref>

* He is also capable of regenerating from damage, but at a slower rate <ref>''The Incredible Hulk '' vol. 1, #288</ref>.

The Abomination is still very resistant to damage and can hold his breath for extended periods of time. The Abomination can also go into a state of suspended animation if in a climate lacking air or heat. He can also bound like the Hulk, and travel many miles with one hop.

== Other versions ==

'''Ultimate Abomination'''

This version of the Abomination appears in the series ''[[Ultimates|Ultimates 2]]''. Now a Chinese scientist, he discovers a means of becoming an Asian version of the Hulk. Unlike the Hulk, the Ultimate Abomination retained his mental faculties. He resembled a yellowish combination of gorilla and reptile, and was at last 25 feet tall. The Ultimate Abomination was a member of the [[The Liberators (comics)|Liberators]], and in a final battle with the Hulk is decapitated.

==Appearances in other media==

===Video games===

* The Abomination is the central villain of ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'' video game (2005), in which he is voiced, both as Emil Blonsky and the Abomination, by [[Ron Perlman]]. The game retells a definitive origin of the Abomination character, and ties directly into [[Peter David]]'s Abomination focused sister-story entitled "Hulk: Destruction". Combined, the two redefine Abomination's origin in one consistent story.  

* The Abomination also appears in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.

===Film===

[[Avi Arad]] of Marvel has confirmed that the Abomination will be a villain in the upcoming film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', the sequel to ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]''.
