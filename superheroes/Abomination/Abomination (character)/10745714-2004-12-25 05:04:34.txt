[[Image:Abom-l.jpg|thumb]]'''Abomination''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #90.

Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a [[spy]] of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] origin in the [[KGB]], the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of [[gamma radiation]] similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into [[The Incredible Hulk]].  As a result he gained substantial bone/muscle mass and height (he stands 6 feet, 8 inches tall) and as such possesses [[superhuman]] strength equivalent to, if not greater than, that of the Hulk.  While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] after this transformation, he cannot revert to human form.  He is extraordinarily resistant to physical impact and extremes of [[temperature]], and has powerful [[regeneration|regenerative]] abilities.

In recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia.  Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty]].  He [[poison]]ed her with his radioactve blood, causing Banner and his associates to believed that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning.  Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat.
