The '''Abomination''' ('''Emil Blonsky''')  is a [[fictional character]] <!--DO NOT ADD ARCHENEMY OF THE HULK, USE THE TALK PAGE--> that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #90 (April 1967), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gil Kane]].

==Publication History==
[[Stan Lee]] chose the name "the Abomination", which he realized belonged to no other character, before conceiving the character's background and appearance. Lee recalled that he simply told the artist [[Gil Kane]] to "make him bigger and stronger than the Hulk and we'll have a lot of fun with him".<ref>{{cite news | author = Tim Lammers | title = Stan Lee Pumped Over Return Of 'Incredible Hulk' | work = [[KCRA-TV]] | date = 2008-06-11 | url = http://www.kcra.com/entertainment/16574962/detail.html | accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Zagreb]], [[Yugoslavia]],<!--DO NOT CHANGE TO CROATIA. WAS YUGOSLAVIA WHEN CHARACTER INTRODUCED--><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Abomination Abomination - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> '''Emil Blonsky''' is a [[KGB]] agent and spy who becomes the Abomination after deliberately exposing himself to a greater quantity of the same [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] that transformed [[Bruce Banner]] into the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Blonsky is transformed into a massive green-skinned monster with physical strength exceeding that of the Hulk; in his first appearance, he is more than twice as powerful as the Hulk. Although he retains his mental faculties, Blonsky soon discovers his inability to return to human form.  

The Abomination has repeatedly joined forces with General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] to fight the Hulk,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #159 (Jan. 1973)</ref> but always betrays Ross, first teaming with the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in an attempt to take over [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base,<ref>''Hulk'' #171 (Jan. 1974)</ref> and later tricking the Hulk into an alliance and attempting to ransom the captured [[Kennedy Space Center]].<ref>''Hulk'' #195-196 (Jan. - Feb. 1976)</ref>

The Abomination is later briefly lost in space,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #270 (Apr. 1981)</ref> but is rescued by the U.S. military and revived by [[MODOK]] and General Ross. In this third association with Ross, the Abomination is forced to battle the Hulk, but turns against MODOK, who atomizes him.<ref>''Hulk'' #287-290 (Sep. - Nov. 1983)</ref> His atomized body reconstitutes itself with the disembodied mind of [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]]. This amalgamated being forces Banner to try to cure this condition, but the procedure fails, leaving Tyrannus in the Abomination body and returning Blonsky to human form.<ref>''Hulk'' Annual #15 (1986)</ref>  Tyrannus briefly operates as the Abomination and attacks [[Wonder Man]],<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #25 (Oct. 1987)</ref> until [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]] restore Tyrannus to normal.  Blonsky again becomes the Abomination, but as a mindless beast, and battles [[She-Hulk]] and [[Spider-Man]] in New York.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #23 (1989))</ref>  He later recovers his mental faculties and is hired to steal toxic waste from the Yucca Flats research center, but is caught off guard and doused in toxic waste by the Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' #364 (Dec. 1989)</ref>

Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and returns to attack his archenemy time and again. Although stronger than the Hulk in a calm state, the Abomination has almost always been beaten by the Hulk's sheer ferocity.  

In later issues, it is revealed that Blonsky's transformation alienates his ballet-dancer ex-wife, Nadia. Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, Blonsky is driven insane with hatred for Banner.  The Abomination also grows incensed upon learning that Banner has married [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], the daughter of Thunderbolt Ross.

With the loss of his wife, Blonsky decides that Banner should also lose his spouse.  The Abomination subsequently poisons Betty with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her proximity to the Hulk has given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Banner later exposes the Abomination's role in Betty's false death, and the Hulk defeats him in combat. Banner then forgives the Abomination, who cannot accept this act. Blonsky finally realizes that he has been living a lie — it is he who is the monster, not the Hulk. 

Months later, the still-grieving General Ross manipulates the Hulk into attacking and almost killing the Abomination. The Abomination is then taken into custody by the military, and as punishment is forced to watch a film loop of him and his wife prior to his transformation, making his incarceration a constant reminder of what he has lost.

Eventually, operatives from the secret organization Home Base release the Abomination in order to fight the Hulk. The Abomination has become even more vicious as a result of his incarceration, and reminds Banner of the loss of Betty to goad him into a violent response. The plan backfires as the Abomination faces an enraged Hulk, who utterly defeats him. 

These events are later revealed to have been a hallucination created by the entity [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]],<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 3, #81</ref> which is confirmed when Blonsky shows no knowledge of the relationship, and also declares that he's had two different wives named Nadia, about which Abomination states, "It happens. Hey, [[Johnny Carson]]'s been married to Joan, Joanna and Joanne," to explain the difference in personality. Blonsky is then employed as a U.S. government [[contract killing|hitman]] against hostile foreign interests.<ref>''Hulk: Destruction'' #4 (2007)</ref> 

The Abomination later realizes the Hulk is missing, and rampages through the city of Reno, in [[Nevada]], but is stopped by [[She-Hulk]]. An apparently fully human Blonsky is later identified among the subjects of a program code-named "Project Achilles", whose mandate is to create a super-power nullifying system in [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] form.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 3, #15</ref><ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 4, #18</ref>

The Abomination is later shown to have fought a new enemy named [[Red Hulk]]. Upon being defeated, he is shot multiple times and presumably killed.<ref name="hulknew1"> ''Hulk'' #1 (2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Blonsky's transformation into the Abomination substantially increases his strength and durability, giving him many of the same powers as the Hulk. Like the Hulk, the Abomination is still very resistant to damage, can hold his breath for extended periods of time, and can breathe underwater for extended periods of time. The Abomination is also capable of regenerating from severe damage, but at a slower rate than the Hulk, and can also go into a state of suspended animation if in a climate lacking air or heat. Like the Hulk, he can travel many miles by simply jumping.

Though similar to the Hulk, the Abomination also differs from the Hulk in several ways. First and foremost, Blonsky's transformation is permanent, unlike the Hulk's rage-induced transformations. In addition, while the Abomination was originally shown to be stronger than a calm Hulk, his strength does not increase with anger as the Hulk's does. Finally, he retains his intelligence in his new gamma induced form, unlike the Hulk, who becomes a raging monster.

*Abomination is a recurring villain in [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' 1996 animated series]], voiced by [[Kevin Schon]] and later by [[Richard Moll]].

===Film===
[[Image:MovieAbomination.jpg|thumb|200px|The Abomination as he appears in the 2008 film, ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.]]
*[[Tim Roth]] portrays Emil Blonsky in the 2008 film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and also supplied [[motion capture]] for his alter-ego, as well as his voice, which was digitally enhanced. In the film, Blonsky is a captain, Russian-born, [[Royal Marines|British Royal Marine]] on loan to the US Armed Forces in its efforts to recapture Bruce Banner. He is offered a [[Captain America|super-soldier serum]] that makes him an effective [[supersoldier]] but is not enough to render him a match for the Hulk. He soon grows obsessed with defeating the Hulk, getting even more super-soldier serum in his system. Later combined with Banner's blood, it creates a mutation more extreme than the Hulk. His skin, muscles and bones become exaggerated, and he can use his spine and bones sticking out of his elbows and heels as weapons. After the battle, the Hulk chokes him into submission with a giant chain and he is  then imprisoned in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. The project's original screenwriter [[Zak Penn]] said the character would not be called 'The Abomination', since the codename sounded "silly", and that he would simply be referred to as Blonsky onscreen. However, the name was referenced when [[Leader (comics)|Dr. Samuel Sterns]] tells Blonsky that further mutating Blonsky's already altered DNA could make him into "an abomination".<ref name=AbomBlonsky>>{{cite news | author = Scott Collura | title = Hulk Villain Talk | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-05-03]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/785/785584p1.html | accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> In the film, he maintains many of his comic book abilities, mainly showcasing his strength. After his second encounter with the Hulk, he is very badly injured, and a doctor stated his bones appeared to be "crushed gravel". Blonksy recovered in mere days, displaying the healing abilities that came with the super-soldier serum  .{{Fact|date=November 2008}}
