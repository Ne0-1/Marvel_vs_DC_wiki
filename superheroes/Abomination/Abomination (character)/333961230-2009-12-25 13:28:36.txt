The character first appears in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #90 (April 1967), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Gil Kane]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character of the Abomination has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as arcade and [[video game]]s, [[animation|animated]] [[television program|television series]], merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s, and the 2008 film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.

== Publication history ==
=== Origin ===
[[Stan Lee]] chose the name "the Abomination", which he realized belonged to no other character, before conceiving the character's background and appearance. Lee recalled that he simply told the artist [[Gil Kane]] to "make him bigger and stronger than the Hulk and we'll have a lot of fun with him." <ref>{{cite news | author = Tim Lammers | title = Stan Lee Pumped Over Return Of 'Incredible Hulk' | work = [[KCRA-TV]] | date = 2008-06-11 | url = http://www.kcra.com/entertainment/16574962/detail.html | accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

Emil Blonsky first appeared in the title ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', and is introduced as a [[KGB]] agent and spy who became the Abomination after deliberately exposing himself to a greater quantity of the same [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] that transformed Bruce Banner into his [[alter ego]] the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. In his first appearance, Blonsky became a large scaly humanoid with twice the strength of the Hulk. In accordance with Lee's wishes, the character defeated the Hulk in their first battle.<ref name="Astonish' 1967">''Tales to Astonish'' #90 - 91 (April - May 1967)</ref>

== Biography ==
=== 1960s ===
Although killed in a first battle with the Abomination, the Hulk is revived by [[General]] [[Thunderbolt Ross]]. The Hulk eventually reverts to Banner, who lures the Abomination into a trap and drains off the character's excess power, allowing the Hulk to defeat him. The entire encounter is observed by the cosmic entity the ''[[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'', who encountered the Hulk in the previous storyline and was dissuaded from destroying the Earth by Banner.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #89 (Apr. 1967)</ref> The Stranger decides that the Hulk's actions were valorous and takes the Abomination - judged to be evil - off world for further study.<ref name="Astonish' 1967"/>

=== 1970s ===
The Abomination reappears when summoned by a [[coven]] of [[witch]]es to briefly battle the cosmic hero the [[Silver Surfer]]<ref>''Silver Surfer'' #12 (Jan. 1970)</ref> and summons the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] (via an absent Stranger's technology) to aid him in escaping the Stranger's laboratory world. Thor frees the Abomination and the other captives, but on discovering they are all evil uses his mystic hammer ''[[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]'' to [[time travel]] several hours into the past, thereby undoing this. After defeating the Abomination and placing the character in prison, Thor departs.<ref name="Thor vol. 2, #178 July 1970"/> When the Hulk is defeated by the alien ''Xeron the Star Slayer'' (who is in [[New York City]] hunting a giant creature called ''[[Klaatu (comics)|Klaatu]]'') and brought aboard a space vessel, the Abomination is revealed to be [[first mate]] of the alien crew. When the captain of the vessel directs Xeron and the crew to battle Klaatu in space, the Hulk and the Abomination are thrown from the vessel and battle until the pair are drawn into Earth's [[orbit]] and separated.<ref> ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #136 - 137 (Mar. - Apr. 1971)</ref> 

It is revealed in [[flashback]] that the Abomination entered into a [[coma]] on impacting with the Earth and is buried for two years. Revived by an off-course [[missile]] fired from [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] Base (under Ross' jurisdiction), the Abomination joins forces with General Ross to defeat the Hulk, but is battered into submission by an angered Hulk.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #159 (Jan. 1973)</ref> The character reappears with fellow Hulk foe the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], and the pair activate a gamma bomb at the Hulkbuster base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. The Hulk's companion of the time, [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]], deactivates the bomb and the Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #171 (Jan. 1974)</ref> A comatose Abomination is eventually found by soldiers at Ross' direction and has a miniature bomb implanted in his [[skull]], being told to fight and defeat the Hulk or be killed. The Abomination manages to trick the Hulk into an alliance and betrays Ross by attempting to [[ransom]] the captured [[Kennedy Space Center]]. The plan fails when the Hulk turns on the Abomination and the pair fight, with the Abomination being caught on a [[rocket]] when it explodes.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #194 - 196 (Dec. 1975 - Feb. 1976)</ref>

An [[illusion]] of the Abomination also appears with other Hulk foes when the Hulk (at the time possessing the intelligence of Banner) enters the [[brain]] of [[Colonel]] [[Glenn Talbot]] at [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] size to [[excise]] a [[tumor]].<ref>''Hulk'' #200 (June 1976)</ref>

=== 1980s ===
The Abomination eventually reappears as a servant of the entity the [[Galaxy Master]], having been empowered with even greater strength. After another extended battle with the Hulk, the Hulk attacks and destroys the Galaxy Master, causing the villain to weaken and apparently become lost in [[outer space|space]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #270 (Apr. 1982)</ref> When Hulk foe [[MODOK]] invades the Hulkbuster base, he colludes with General Ross to revive the Abomination, who was found in a block of ice above Earth and kept in [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] storage for further study. MODOK intends to use the Abomination against his superiors at [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM)]], while Ross hopes the villain will destroy the Hulk. The Abomination, however, has become afraid of the Hulk and has to be mentally forced by MODOK to fight.

Tyrannus as the Abomination then comes into conflict with the ''Gray Hulk'', and quickly defeats the weaker version of the Hulk. When the Hulk reverts back to Banner, Tyrannus forces him to create a procedure that will separate Blonsky, who is mentally fighting Tyrannus for control of the Abomination. The process is successful and Blonksy is restored to a human form, free of Tyrannus, still occupying the form of the Abomination.

The character also possesses [[gill]]s which enable him to breathe underwater, and can enter a state of [[suspended animation]] when bereft of [[oxygen]] for long periods. When originally created, the Abomination was approximately twice as strong as the Hulk's calm state, but his strength does not increase with anger.

== Other versions ==
An [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] of the Abomination features in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint title ''[[The Ultimates 2]]'', as part of an international group called the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]]. This version of the Abomination is a [[China|Chinese]] scientist named '''Chang Lam'''.<ref>''Ultimates'' 2 #1 - 6 (Feb. - July 2005); #7 (Sep. 2005); #8 (Nov. 2005); #9 (Jan. 2006); #10 (Mar. 2006); #11 - 12 (July - Aug. 2006); #13 (Feb. 2007)</ref>

The character also stars in the [[limited series]] ''Abominations'', which continues plot points from the ''Future Imperfect'' storyline.<ref>''Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect'' #1 - 2 (Dec. 1992 - Feb. 1993)</ref> A group of [[time travel]]ling [[assassination|assassins]] from the time of the villain the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] - sent by an alternate version of the Abomination called "Emil" -  arrive in the present, intent on killing ''Betty-6'', a futuristic version of Betty Ross who is [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with the Maestro's child. The Abomination provides shelter for Betty-6 and prevents the assassination.<ref>''Abominations'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1996 - Feb. 1997)</ref>

==In other media==
In television, the Abomination serves fellow Hulk villain the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] in [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' 1996 animated series]] voiced by [[Kevin Schon]] and later [[Richard Moll]], and features in the ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Steven Blum]] (2009).
[[Image:MovieAbomination.jpg|thumb|200px|The Abomination in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008).]] 
Emil Blonsky and the Abomination also stars in the 2008 film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. [[Tim Roth]] plays Blonksy and supplies [[motion capture]] and voice effects for the Abomination, which is digitally enhanced. In the film, Blonsky is a Russian-born [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[Royal Marines|British Royal Marine]]s on loan to the US Armed Forces in its' efforts to recapture Bruce Banner. A [[Captain America|super-soldier serum]] transforms Blonksy into a superior soldier, but in attempt to match the Hulk secretly receives an infusion of Banner's blood, which creates a mutation more extreme than the Hulk. 

The project's original screenwriter [[Zak Penn]] said the character would not be called 'The Abomination', since the codename sounded "silly", and that he would simply be referred to as Blonsky onscreen. The name, however, is referenced when scientist [[Leader (comics)|Dr. Samuel Sterns]] tells Blonsky that further mutating Blonsky's already altered DNA could turn him into "an abomination".<ref name=AbomBlonsky>>{{cite news | author = Scott Collura | title = Hulk Villain Talk | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2007-05-03 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/785/785584p1.html | accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref>

The Abomination also features in several [[video game]]s, including ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1994 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (1994) and ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'' (2005) voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]. [[Tim Roth]] reprises his role as Emil Blonsky in the [[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|video game adaptation]] of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008), with the Abomination voiced by Jon Curry (vocal effects provided by Jeffrey Parker). Steven Blum who voices Abomination in the [[The Super Hero Squad Show]], also provided his voice for the [[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|video game]] (2009). 

The Abomination is also a toy character, featuring in the first series of [[Hulk Classics]]; [[Marvel Legends]] Series 13 and an action figure of the Abomination based on the character in the 2008 film was released in May, 2008. The Abomination also appears in [[Heroscape]].
