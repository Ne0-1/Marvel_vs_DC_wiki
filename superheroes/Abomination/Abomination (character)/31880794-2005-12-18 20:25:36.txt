The '''Abomination''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gil Kane]] in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #90.

==Character biography==
Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a [[spy]] of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Yugoslavia]]n origin working for the [[KGB]], the Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of [[gamma radiation]] similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into [[The Incredible Hulk]].  As a result he was permanently transformed into a massive green-skinned monster whose physical power was equivalent to, if not greater than, that of the Hulk.  While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form.

Given his gamma-spawned origins, Blonsky blames his condition on Banner and his alter ego, the Hulk. Both the Abomination and the Hulk have clashed on numerous occasions, with Blonsky perpetually playing the role of the aggressor. Although Blonsky occasionally gains the upper hand in their battles, the Hulk manages to triumph in the end. But not always; the Abomination is one of the few who can lay claim to victory over the green-skinned goliath.

In recent years, it was revealed that his hideous new visage had served to alienate Blonsky from his ex-wife, Nadia.  Coupled with constant defeats at the hands of the Hulk, this has driven Blonsky nearly insane in his hatred for Banner. The Abomination also grew incensed upon learning that Banner had married Betty Ross, the daughter of General Thunderbolt Ross. With the loss of his wife, Blonsky figured it is only fair to him that Banner should lose Betty. Out of jealousy, he caused the apparent death of Bruce Banner's wife [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty]].  While she was recovering from radiation sickness caused by exposure to the gamma radiation within Banner, he [[poison]]ed her with his radioactive blood, causing Banner and his associates to believe that her close proximity to the Hulk had given her a fatal case of radiation poisoning.  Banner later exposed the Abomination's role in Betty's seeming death, and defeated him in combat.

Not only his grand scheme failed, Banner also forgave Blonsky. The Abomination could not comprehend and endure his enemy's absolution, and his moment of triumph was twisted into crushing defeat. Blonsky realized he had become what he abhored the most - he was the rampaging, inhuman monster, not the Hulk he religiously believed all these years.

Months later, the still-grieving General Ross manipulated the Hulk into attacking and almost killing Blonsky. The Abomination was taken into custody by the military; as punishment, he was forced to watch a film loop of himself and his wife prior to his transformation, making his incarceration a constant reminder of what he has lost.

==Powers and abilities==

Blonsky's transformation into the Abomination substantially increased his bone/muscle mass and height (he stands 6 feet, 8 inches tall).  The resultant levels of [[superhuman]] strength, endurance and durability surpass those of the Hulk when the Hulk is not angered; the upward limit of what the Abomination can press is over 150 tons and as high as 200 tons but not incalculably high. However, unlike the Hulk in most of his incarnations, the Abomination's strength does not increase as he becomes angry (the Abomination's strength does not nearly approach that of the enraged Hulk).  Like the Hulk, the Abomination can use his superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances, covering up to two miles in a single bound. 

Unlike the Hulk, the Abomination's transformation has proved stable: he cannot change back and forth between his human state and his superhuman state, despite his wishes to the contrary.  Though the Abomination has proven able to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] lost eyes and recover from other forms of massive cellular damage, his ability to regenerate tissue is much slower than that of the Hulk. The Abomination is resistant to extremes of [[temperature]], and can hold his breath for extended periods of time; in the case of lack of air or heat, he may enter a coma-like state of suspended animation.

==Other Media==

The Abomination is the central villain of 2005's [[Hulk (comics)#Video games|Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]] videogame, in which he is voiced by [[Ron Perlman]].  The game retells a definitive origin of the Abomination character, and ties directly into [[Peter David]]'s Abomination focused sister-story entitled "Hulk: Destruction".  Combined, the two redefine Abomination's origin in one consistent story.

Abomination reaches new levels of power in the game.  He initially appears as approximately 12' tall as with his classic manifestation - and the ability to intermittently transform back into human form.  Due to the instability of his condition he later appears in much larger and more visibly mutated version of the Abomination, standing approximately 20-25' tall, with appropriately increased levels of physical power.  

It has been suggested that the Abomination will be the main, or at least one of the main, villains in the loosely-expected sequel to the ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', ''[[Hulk 2]]''.
