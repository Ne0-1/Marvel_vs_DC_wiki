'''Flamingo''' is the name of a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[Batman]].

==Publication history==
Flamingo first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #666 (July 2007) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Eduardo Flamingo''' is an emotionless, unfeeling killer that has a tendency to eat his victim's faces after he's murdered them. According to Gabriel Santo, Flamingo has an impeccable kill record. [[Jason Todd]] (who was the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and is now [[Red Hood]]) has rallied a defense against Flamingo, but wound up with a bullet wound to the face and knee-cap. Flamingo then turns his attentions to Red Hood's partner Scarlet. Flamingo then tugs at the seams of Scarlet's mask before she gashes him with one of her blades. Feeling responsible for the girl and her condition, [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] jumps into the fray to help, but receives four bullets to his cape-protected spine for his troubles, paralyzing him from the waist down. [[Dick Grayson]] (who was operating as [[Batman]] at the time) delivers a much-deserved boot to Flamingo's face. It is ultimately Jason Todd who finishes things up. When Dick is nearly tossed over the side of the building, Jason uses a construction digger to scoop Flamingo up along with other assorted rocks and debris and deposit him over the edge plummeting to the Earth below. [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]] later tells Batman that Flamingo's body was never found.<ref>''Batman and Robin #6</ref>

===The New 52===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Flamingo was among the villains seen as an inmate at [[Arkham Asylum]]. He is among the inmates seen attacking the Batman before [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] (who was actually Nightwing in disguise) appears to come to Batman's aide and the pair work together to beat back the group of rampaging inmates.<ref>''Batman'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Flamingo appears as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]'s incarnation of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref>

During the ''Gothtopia'' storyline, Flamingo was later seen among those who have taken over Arkham Asylum. He and [[Nocturna]] later get knocked out by Batman.<ref>''Detective Comics'' Vol. 2 #28</ref>

While Batman is teased by Julia about his romantic failure with [[Catwoman]], he gets distracted when Flamingo's motorcycle skids past him. Batman makes a hurried u-turn and catches up to his prey, running him down, and sending the assassin flying from his bike.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #27</ref> Batman has taken down Flamingo and allows the man to wake in a cemetery. Batman watches Flamingo get up and leave, in order that he can follow him back to his employer. En route, Flamingo receives an invitation to Catwoman's impending murder. Batman follows Flamingo to the Moffat Building, where he discovers the aftermath of the shooting. Dragos Ibanescu lies dead, and both Catwoman and [[Killer Croc]] are traumatized by Jade McKillen's death.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #28</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Flamingo doesn't have any powers, but he is a skilled hit man, in excellent physical condition. He wields a variety of weapons, from chain whips to sub-machine guns. He also drives a variety of vehicles, though the most common is a bright pink motorcycle.
