'''Black Crow''' ('''Jesse Black Crow''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the United States|Native American]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Jesse Black Crow, a member of the Navajo nation, left the [[New Mexico]] reservation to become a construction worker on skyscrapers in New York City. One day, while working 20 stories up, scaffolding gave way and Jesse plunged to the ground. He survived the fall, but was permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Comatose in the hospital, Jesse received a vision from the spirit of the Earth showing him the plight of the Native American people. When needed, the spirit transformed Jesse into, '''Black Crow''', a mystical warrior and protector of his people.

The Earth spirit first sent Black Crow to challenge [[Captain America]] to a trial by combat because, as a symbol of modern America, Captain America must perish to appease the spirit. After a well-fought battle, Captain America made a gesture of appeasement to the Earth spirit. This ended the conflict and created a spiritual bond between the two American heroes.

==Powers==
Black Crow has numerous mystical powers given to him by the spirit of the Earth. Known powers include the ability to change into a crow or bolt of lightning. Although Jesse is paralyzed from the waist down, when he transforms into his mystical warrior form he has superhuman agility and is a gifted combatant. Some weeks later, Black Crow appeared at Captain America's bedside. The Captain had been poisoned by the [[Red Skull]] and was on the brink of death. Black Crow enhanced Captain America's will to live and the poison burned out of his system. Months later, the Earth spirit sent Black Crow to observe [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] who was to meet with a mysterious danger that never materialized.

Much later, Black Crow battled the malevolent Native American spirit, the Cat, in Yosemite National Park, but neither could defeat the other. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], travelled to Yosemite to train, but was unable due to the Cat's influence. Black Crow told the Avenger that he was chosen to defeat the Cat. At first, Hawkeye disagreed, but finally agreed and defeated the Cat with Black Crow's help.

Black Crow later assisted [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]] and [[Dr. Strange]] rescue Red Wolf's mentor, [[Owayodata]], who had been taken hostage by a trio of other Native American gods, [[Calumet]], [[Nanabozho]] and [[Hotamitanio]].

Some time later, Black Crow interceded into a conflict between [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]. He put Spider-Man and Puma through a mystical experience to resolve their differences, and then removed Puma's knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity. Soon after this, Black Crow is attacked by the demon [[D'Spayre]]. But, Black Crow finally reveals himself as real to Jesse and with their combined strength defeat D'Spayre.

In his last known appearance, Black Crow appeared to Captain America telling him that he was going to die within 24 hours.
