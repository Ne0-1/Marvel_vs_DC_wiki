'''The Hate-Monger''' is a [[supervillain]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, a fictional representation of [[Adolf Hitler]].

==Biography==

Hitler's life and accomplishments in the [[Earth 616]] dimension are very similar to his life in the real world, up to his death on [[April 30]], [[1945]].  However, there are several deviations from history, notably Hitler's use of several supervillains to further his goals (like the [[Red Skull]] and [[Baron Zemo]]), and his subsequent opposition by several [[superhero]]es (like the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Original Human Torch]], [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and especially [[Captain America]]). There were other deviations, such as Hitler [[Faust|selling his soul to the Devil]], and being in possession of a cursed coin that had previously belonged to [[Judas Iscariot]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Attila the Hun]] and [[Napoleon]], granting each success and then destruction.

As in real life, Hitler [[Hitler's death|died]] on April 30, 1945, although the story of his [[suicide]] was a coverup, as Hitler was actually killed in an encounter with the Human Torch. Unlike in real life, however, Hitler was not finished with his dreams of conquest yet.

==The Rise of the Hate-Monger==

After the end of [[World War II]], Hitler revealed that while his body was destroyed, his mind lived on. Working with the renegade Nazi scientist Arnim Zola, Hitler had discovered a way to transfer his consciousness into a new body, cloned from Hitler's original body. Several of these clones had been created, allowing Hitler to live on even if one of his new bodies were destroyed. Donning a costume that resembled a cross between the robes of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[Spanish Inquisition]], Hitler dubbed himself the Hate-Monger.

Exactly what the Hate-Monger was up to from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is unrevealed, but presumably he was biding his time, gathering resources and making his plans to strike. One invention Zola and his scientists had developed during this interim was the "H-Ray", a hand-held device that could cause nearly anybody to feel uncontrollable fear and hatred. Finally the Hate-Monger revealed himself to the world, using his H-Ray to incite riots in the small nation of San Gusto, taking it over with his [[stormtroopers]]. The H-Ray proved its power when the [[Fantastic Four]] arrived to investigate and were promptly turned on each other by the weapon's influence. However, [[Nick Fury]], at the time a [[CIA]] agent, was able to restore the Fantastic Four to normal, and together they infiltrated the Hate-Monger's headquarters. When the Hate-Monger was shot dead by one of his own stormtroopers (who had been shot by the H-Ray by mistake), the assembled heroes were shocked when they removed the Hate-Monger's mask and saw the face of Adolf Hitler. However, by now Hitler had transferred his consciousness into one of his reserve clones.

The Hate-Monger made many more schemes over the years, clashing with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], [[Man-Wolf]] and his old enemy Captain America, among others. He eventually allied himself with his old servant Red Skull. Despite their mutual personal histories, the two allies plotted against each other when they gained possession of the [[Cosmic Cube]], which could only be weilded by one person. Hitler decided to use his mind-transference powers to gain control of the Cube itself, rather than another clone. It was only after he had transferred his mind into the Cube that he realized that the Cube was not complete, and was only an empty shell. His mind trapped within a featureless void, Hitler screamed in panic until he gradually faded into nothingness.

==Cosmic Cube Rebirth==

Later, while being seemingly disintegrated by an anti-matter beam, the Red Skull used the now-functioning Cube to teleport himself to safety, and to bring the Hate-Monger back to physical reality. Although he had no more clones, the Hate-Monger no longer needed them - he now existed as a being of pure energy, and the H-Ray was now a part of his inherent abilities.

With his new abilities, Hitler was able to pursue much loftier goals, attempting to single-handedly starting World War III and causing discord in the [[United States]], inciting strikes and revolts in [[New York]] under the guise of union representative Adam Hauser. Finally he stole a mind-amplification device from S.H.I.E.L.D. and used it to increase his powers to cataclysmic levels, causing violence and destruction all over the United States.

The Hate-Monger captured his old foes Captain America, Nick Fury and Namor, and boasted that they were powerless to stop him. While Fury and Namor suscepted to the H-Ray, Captain America refused to surrender to his hatred. This failure infuriated the Hate-Monger so much the mind-amplifier exploded, destroying him for once and for all.

==Other Hate-Mongers==

Aside from Hitler, there were several other Hate-Mongers, but none were as notorious nor as long-lived. 

The second Hate-Monger was the [[Man-Beast]]. The third was an [[android]] created by [[Psycho-Man]]. The fourth Hate-Monger is an energy vampire who spreads and feeds off hate, who later went by the name [[Animus]].

In addition, Zora created Nazi X, a super-powered [[cyborg]] containing what he claimed was Hitler's original brain. However, this monstrosity and its creator were destroyed in a fire after a single battle with Captain America. 

==Powers and Weapons==

Initially, the Hate-Monger was an ordinary man with no superhuman powers: the H-Ray and other contrivances were weapons manufactured for him. Hitler could transfer his consciousness to his reserve clones upon suffering a fatal injury, but the exact mechanics of this were unclear.

After his resurrection by the Cosmic Cube, the Hate-Monger was now a being of pure energy that could take on any form he wished, and his H-Ray powers were now his own. He was able to regenerate from most wounds and could fire laser-like beams from his eyes.

In addition, Hitler was also a cunning strategist and a charismatic leader, able to incite fanatical loyalty to him through his rhetoric and persuasive personality.

==Trivia==

[[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', a character with many parallels to Hitler, also was able to survive beyond his apparent death (in the movie ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'') by transferring his consciousness into a series of cloned bodies, until his spirit was ultimately destroyed. Whether this was a deliberate homage or a coincidence is unrevealed.
