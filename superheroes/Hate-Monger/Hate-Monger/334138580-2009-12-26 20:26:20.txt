'''The Hate-Monger''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #21 (December, 1962) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Hate-Monger first appeared in the small fictional nation of San Gusto in South America, and came to the attention of authorities when he took over with the use of storm troopers. The [[Fantastic Four]] went to stop a hate rally in New York City, but were caught off guard by Hate-Monger's weapon — the Hate-Ray — which instilled hate for others. As a result, the team disbanded and went their separate ways. [[Nick Fury]], at the time a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, then managed to trick [[Mister Fantastic]] into traveling to San Gusto with him to fight the Hate-Monger, knowing the other members would follow. Fury and Reed infiltrated the Hate-Monger's headquarters, followed by the rest of the Fantastic Four. Fury managed to cure Mister Fantastic, who in turn cured the rest of the team. In the final confrontation, the Hate-Monger was shot and killed by one of his own storm-troopers when an H-Ray beam struck the soldier by mistake. When Mr. Fantastic removed the Hate-Monger's mask, it was revealed that Hate-Monger was [[Adolf Hitler]] — who apparently survived [[World War II]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #21</ref>

It was discovered later that the scientist [[Arnim Zola]] had perfected a means of transferring the mind to the body of a clone, thereby allowing Hitler to live on in the event of the death of his body. The Hate-Monger suffered a succession of defeats by Nick Fury, who wrecked the Hate-Monger's attempt to blackmail the nations of Earth with the "hate-ray" from an orbiting space station.  The Hate-Monger was killed again.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' #9 - 11</ref> The Hate Monger returned and planned to use a spacecraft to recapture his space station from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] He fought the [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]], but his base was invaded by S.H.I.E.L.D. and he was killed again.<ref>''Creatures On The Loose'' #34 - 35</ref> 

His consciousness then resided within a cloned brain mounted on an android.  Zola and the [[Red Skull]] unsuccessfully attempted to transplant the brain into the body of his old enemy, [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1, #211-212</ref> He later battled Captain America again.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1, #227 - 228</ref> The Hate-Monger eventually allied himself with his old pupil the Red Skull, and the two villains began plotting against each other when they gained possession of the [[Cosmic Cube]], which could only be wielded by one person. The Hate-Monger decided to use his mind-transference powers to gain control of the Cube itself, rather than another clone. It was only after he had transferred his mind into the Cube that he realized that the Cube was not complete and nothing more than an empty shell. With the Hate-Monger's mind trapped within the featureless void of the incomplete Cube's matrix, he eventually went mad until fading into nothingness.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #16 - 17</ref>

===Rebirth by the Cosmic Cube===
Years later the Hate-Monger was brought back to physical reality by the Red Skull. The Hate-Monger now existed as a being of pure energy, and was able to project the H-Ray at will. Using his new abilities, the Hate-Monger caused strikes and revolts in [[New York]] under the guise of union representative Adam Hauser. The Hate-Monger then stole a mind-amplification device from S.H.I.E.L.D. which allowed him to incite violence and destruction all over the United States. The Hate-Monger then captured his old foes Captain America, Nick Fury, and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], and boasted that they were powerless to stop him. While Fury and Namor succumbed to the H-Ray, Captain America refused to surrender to his hatred. This failure infuriated the Hate-Monger to such a degree that the mind-amplifier exploded, apparently destroying him for once and for all.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3, #45 - 48</ref>

== New Hate-Monger ==
A new Hate-Monger appeared wearing a version of Captain America's uniform, and is seen murdering illegal immigrants, claiming "America belongs to Americans." This Hate-Monger and his organization were all wiped out by the [[Punisher]], who wore his own version of the Captain America uniform for the occasion.<ref>''Punisher: War Journal'' #6</ref>

==Other versions==
* The [[Man-Beast]] impersonated the Hate-Monger.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'', vol. 1 #13 - 15</ref>

* [[Psycho-Man]] created an android he called the Hate-Monger until it was destroyed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

* An energy vampire who fed off hate adopted the name of the Hate-Monger for a time, before changing his name to [[Animus (Hate-Monger)|Animus]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #342</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Hate-Monger was an ordinary man with no superhuman powers, created as the result of cloning and genetic engineering. The Hate-Monger's brain has been "energized" by Arnim Zola's techniques, enabling him to project his consciousness into the brain of a body cloned from his own if his current body is dying. He used several such bodies, including one which possessed super-human strength, but was mute.

The Hate-Monger wears chain-mail body armor under his hood, tunic, and boots.  He has sometimes worn an armored battle-suit containing an exoskeleton that amplifies his strength to superhuman levels.  Scientists and technicians in the Hate-Monger's employ, including Arnim Zola, have manufactured and supplied him with a number of other paraphernalia and contrivances.  He is often armed with his handgun projecting the "Hate-ray" or "H-ray," high frequency microwave radiation that affects the centers of the human brain controlling emotions so as to stimulate and magnify the victims' feelings of dread, fear, and anger to unreasonable levels, including repressed or subconscious sentiments of this kind. The hate-ray can also transform feelings of love into equally strong or perhaps even stronger hatreds. He also had access to large-scale "Hate-ray" projectors, missiles armed with nuclear warheads, disease-carrying bacilli, and various advanced aircraft and spacecraft.

After his resurrection by the Cosmic Cube, the Hate-Monger was now a being of pure energy that could take on any form he wished, and his H-Ray powers were now his own. He was able to regenerate from most wounds and could fire laser-like beams from his eyes.

As Hitler, the Hate-Monger was also a cunning strategist and a charismatic leader, and able to incite fanatical loyalty to him through his rhetoric and persuasive personality. He is a good hand-to-hand combatant, and has apparently received some training in physical combat. He also had some talent in painting.
