'''The Hate-Monger''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #21 (December, 1962) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Hate-Monger first appeared in the small fictional nation of San Gusto in South America, and came to the attention of authorities when he took over with the use of storm troopers. The [[Fantastic Four]] went to stop a hate rally, but were caught off guard by Hate-Monger's weapon - the Hate-Ray - which instilled hate for others. As a result, the team disbanded and went their separate ways. [[Nick Fury]], at the time a [[CIA]] agent, then managed to trick Mr. Fantastic into traveling to San Gusto with him to fight the Hate-Monger, knowing the other members would follow. Fury and Reed infiltrated the Hate-Monger's headquarters, followed by the rest of the Fantastic Four. Fury managed to cure Mr. Fantastic, who in turn cured the rest of the team. In the final confrontation, the Hate-Monger was shot and killed by one of his own storm-troopers when a H-Ray beam struck the soldier by mistake. When Mr. Fantastic removed the Hate-Monger's mask, it was revealed that Hate-Monger was [[Adolf Hitler]] - who apparently survived [[World War II]]. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #21</ref>

It was discovered later that the scientist [[Arnim Zola]] had perfected a means of transferring the mind to the body of a clone, thereby allowing Hitler to live on in the event of the death of his body. <ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' #9 - 11</ref> The Hate Monger returned to battle [[S.H.I.E.L.D]],  [[Man-Wolf]]  <ref>''Creatures On The Loose'' #34 - 35</ref> and his old enemy [[Captain America]]. <ref>''Captain America'' vol. 1, #227 - 228</ref> The Hate Monger eventually allied himself with his old pupil the Red Skull, who began plotting against each other when they gained possession of the [[Cosmic Cube]], which could only be wielded by one person. The Hate Monger decided to use his mind-transference powers to gain control of the Cube itself, rather than another clone. It was only after he had transferred his mind into the Cube that he realized that the Cube was not complete and nothing more than an empty shell. With the Hate Monger's mind trapped within a featureless void, he eventually went mad until fading into nothingness. <ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #16 - 17</ref>

==Rebirth by the Cosmic Cube==
Years later the Hate-Monger was brought back to physical reality by the Red Skull. The Hate Monger now existed as a being of pure energy, and was able to project the H-Ray at will. Using his new abilities, the Hate Monger caused strikes and revolts in [[New York]] under the guise of union representative Adam Hauser. The Hate Monger then stole a mind-amplification device from S.H.I.E.L.D. which allowed him to incite violence and destruction all over the United States. The Hate-Monger then captured his old foes Captain America, Nick Fury and the [[Sub-Mariner]], and boasted that they were powerless to stop him. While Fury and Namor succumbed to the H-Ray, Captain America refused to surrender to his hatred. This failure infuriated the Hate-Monger to such a degree that the mind-amplifier exploded, apparently destroying him for once and for all. <ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3, #45 - 48</ref>

== New Hate-Monger ==
A new Hate-Monger has recently appeared wearing a version of Captain America's uniform, and is seen murdering illegal immigrants, claiming "America belongs to Americans." <ref>''Punisher: War Journal'' #6</ref>

==Other versions==
* The [[Man-Beast]] impersonated the Hate Monger. <ref>''spectacular spiderman'', vol. 1 #13 - 15</ref>

* [[Psycho-Man]] created an android he called the Hate Monger until it was destroyed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

* An energy vampire who fed off hate adopted the name of the Hate Monger for a time, before changing his name to Animus. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #342</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Hate-Monger was an ordinary man with no superhuman powers, with the H-Ray and other contrivances being manufactured by Arnim Zola. Courtesy of Zola's techniques, Hitler could transfer his consciousness to his reserve clones upon suffering a fatal injury.

After his resurrection by the Cosmic Cube, the Hate-Monger was now a being of pure energy that could take on any form he wished, and his H-Ray powers were now his own. He was able to regenerate from most wounds and could fire laser-like beams from his eyes.

As Hitler, the Hate Monger was also a cunning strategist and a charismatic leader, and able to incite fanatical loyalty to him through his rhetoric and persuasive personality.
