'''Negative Man''' is a fictional [[superhero]] from the [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared on ''My Greatest Adventures #80.'' 

Originally named Larry Trainor, his exposure to a [[radioactive]] belt while piloting a test rocket gave him the ability to release his soul out of his body, leaving his body defenseless in the process.

While Negative Man appears to be a costumed [[mummy]], his bandages cover his entire body to protect innocent bystanders from his hazardous body condition and bind his soul and body together. He joined the [[Doom Patrol]] along with [[Elasti-Girl]], [[Steve Dayton|Mento]], [[Robotman (DC Comics)|Robotman]], and [[Chief (comics)|The Chief]].

After being seriously injured and (apparently) striken of his powers, Trainor was hospitalized. The Negative Spirit came back and merged Trainor to Dr. Eleanor Poole, a black woman. Together they formed '''Rebis''', a divine [[hermaphrodite]]. Rebis anticipated [[hir]] mating ceremony, the Aenigma Regis, where [[s/he]] would impregnate hirself. Rebis left temporarily Doom Patrol to do this. At some point during hir departure, Rebis had intercourse with [[Coagula]], giving her superpowers. Upon returning, Rebis was killed by [[the Candlemaker]]. Rebis's egg hatched revealing a fully grown new Rebis. According to the ''[[DC Comics Encyclopedia]]'', this Rebis is currently involved with [[Checkmate]].

==Other Media==
On the 5th season of ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'', Negative Man appeared along with the other Doom Patrol, performed by [[Judge Reinhold]].
