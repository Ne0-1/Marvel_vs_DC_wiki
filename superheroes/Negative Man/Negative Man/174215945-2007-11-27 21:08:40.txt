'''Negative Man''' is a fictional [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[My Greatest Adventure]]'' #80. 

== Fictional character biography ==
===Larry Trainor===
The original Negative Man, '''Larry Trainor''', was exposed to a [[radioactive]] belt while piloting a test rocket. This experience left him radioactive himself but gave him the ability to release his soul out of his body, which can fly at high speed and pass through solid materials when desired, and control it. Unfortunately, Trainor found that he was barely conscious while the being is released leaving his body defenseless in the process. Furthermore, he could only risk sending it out for 60 seconds at a time or face certain death.

While Negative Man appears to be a costumed [[mummy]], his specially-treated bandages cover his entire body to protect innocent bystanders from his hazardous body condition and bind his soul and body together. He was a founding member of the [[Doom Patrol]] along with [[Elasti-Girl]], [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], [[Robotman (comics)#Cliff Steele|Robotman]], and [[Chief (comics)|The Chief]].

After being seriously injured and (apparently) stricken of his powers, Trainor was hospitalized. The Negative Spirit possessed a Russian cosmonaut, Colonel '''Valentina Vostok''', who became the [[Negative Woman]]. The Spirit later left her and merged Trainor to Dr. Eleanor Poole, a black woman. Together they formed '''Rebis''', a divine [[hermaphrodite]]. Rebis anticipated their mating ceremony, the Aenigma Regis, where they would impregnate themself. Rebis temporarily left the Doom Patrol due to this. At some point during this absence, Rebis had intercourse with [[Coagula]], giving her superpowers. Upon returning, Rebis was killed by the [[The Candlemaker|Candlemaker]]. Rebis's egg hatched revealing a fully grown new Rebis. According to the ''DC Comics Encyclopedia'', this Rebis is currently involved with [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]].

In 2004, the ''Doom Patrol'' was [[reboot (continuity)|rebooted]] in a ''[[Justice League|JLA]]'' storyline and new ''Doom Patrol'' series, both written and illustrated by [[John Byrne]].  In this version of the Doom Patrol, which ignored previous continuity, Larry Trainor was once again Negative Man (although his negative-energy form now had the appearance of a black skeleton instead of a shadowy humanoid shape).  After this series was cancelled, the miniseries ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' explained that [[Continuity changes during Infinite Crisis|this alteration]] had been caused by [[Superboy-Prime]]'s attempts to escape from the extradimensional "haven" he shared with [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] and the [[Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]] of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]].  When the Doom Patrol joined other heroes in fighting Superboy-Prime, Negative Man and the other Doom Patrol members (including former member [[Beast Boy]]) began recalling their previous lives; all previous incarnations of the Doom Patrol are now in continuity, although the exact details of what this means are not yet clear.

{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
Larry Trainor is once again a member of the [[Doom Patrol#Infinite Crisis and One Year Later|sixth and current incarnation]] of the Doom Patrol.  It is not clear what relationship he has to Negative Man's history as the joined entity Rebis; however, the negative energy can now exist apart from Trainor's body for much longer than 60 seconds. But it looks like Trainor becomes unconscious whenever the negative-energy being leaves his body.

===Ted Bruder===
The fourth incarnation of the Doom Patrol included '''Ted Bruder''', a character with the ability to see sixty seconds into the future. He took the codename '''Fast Forward''', but his incessantly pessimistic outlook led to him being nicknamed '''Negative Man II''' by his team-mates.

==Other media==
On the fifth season of ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', Negative Man appeared along with the other Doom Patrol members. He has a sarcastic matter-of-fact attitude similar to [[Raven (comics)|Raven's]]. His 60 second "soul separation" time limit is absent in the series. He did state that he shouldn't spend too much time separated from his body, but didn't give a specific time limit. However, it is implied that his soul has spent time, caged, outside his body for five months. His voice is performed by [[Judge Reinhold]].

Though it was not specifically stated how long the Negative Spirit could remain separated from his body in this appearance, Negative Man's comment upon being released, "You could have at least thawed me out first.", implies that his physical body may have been frozen, or in some sort of suspended animation. This may explain how he was able to stay separated for so long without ill effect, especially since this method was occasionally employed during other incarnations of Doom Patrol when, for whatever reason, the Negative Spirit was unable to return to Larry Trainor's body.
