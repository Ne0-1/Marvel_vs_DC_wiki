The '''Elders of the Universe''' are a group of [[fictional characters]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. They are the last survivors of the first intelligent [[humanoid]] races that developed after the [[Big Bang]]. As such they have achieved virtual [[immortality]] as well as mastered advanced technologies.

The Elders, because of their links to the first era of the [[Marvel Universe|universe]] history, have come to regard each other as brothers at least figuratively. It is not known how many Elders still remain.

During the ''[[Contest of Champions]]'' miniseries, the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] challenged [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] to a game of strategy, and won; this led to Death becoming angered with the Elders, preventing them from ever entering her realm - in other words, making them effectively [[immortality|immortal]].
