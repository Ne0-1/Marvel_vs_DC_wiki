The '''Elders of the Universe''' are a group of [[fictional]] [[Fictional character|characters]] that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] was the first Elder to appear, and featured in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #28 (May 1966). The character was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Publication history==
The Elders of the Universe are the last survivors of otherwise [[extinct]] races, and are known for their personal obsessions, such as collecting, gaming and fighting, which are pursued fanatically. While the characters are not truly [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]], all have achieved some cosmic level of power and knowledge. The first encounter with the heroes of Earth occurs when the Collector came to Earth seeking to expand his collection. <ref>''Avengers'' #28 (May 1966)</ref> Later, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] created the supervillain team the [[Squadron Sinister]] as pawns to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang the Conqueror]], the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. <ref>''Avengers'' #69 - 71 (Oct. - Dec. 1969)</ref>  

Although thwarted, the Grandmaster and his fellow Elders take an interest in Earth, and the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] has two separate encounters with the Avengers, the second ending with his murder by the entity [[Korvac]].<ref>''Avengers'' #119 (Jan. 1974) + 173 - 174 (July - Aug. 1978)</ref> The Grandmaster also tricks the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] into playing a contest - again involving many of Earth's heroes - that he deliberately loses to resurrect the Collector. <ref>''Contest of Champions'' #1 - 3 (June - Aug. 1982)</ref> The Grandmaster usurps control of Death's realm, and after a battle between the Avengers and the Grandmaster's champions - the [[Legion of the Unliving]] - is tricked by the Avengers. An angered Death then prevents the Elders from ever entering her realm, which effectively makes them immortal and is the Grandmaster's true goal. <ref>''Avengers'' Annual #16 (Dec. 1987)</ref>

The Elder known as the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]] has a brief encounter with many of Earth's strongest heroes. After defeating [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Sasquatch]], [[Wonderman]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Thor]] in hand-to-hand combat,by knockout or DQ, he faces [[Thing (comics)|Benjamin Grimm]] of the [[Fantastic Four]].  Eventually realizing that the outmatched Grimm will never submit under any circumstances, the Champion concedes the match and offers Grimm his respect.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #7 (Jan. 1982)</ref>

The entire group of Elders later join forces (and meet on [[Ego the Living Planet]] who is also regarded as an Elder) in an effort to kill the cosmic entity [[Galactus]], which would cause the concepts [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] to become unbalanced and end the universe. The Elders believe since they are now immortal they would be the only beings in the universe to survive and would be supreme beings in the new universe. The plan, however is thwarted by Galactus' Heralds the [[Silver Surfer]] and [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]] and several of the Elders are consumed by Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 - 10 (July 1987 - Apr. 1988)</ref> Although the Elders escape, three - the [[Astronomer (comics)|Astronomer]], [[Possessor (comics)|Possessor]] and [[Trader (comics)|Trader]] - are permanently erased by an angered Death. <ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #16 - 17 (Oct. - Nov. 1988)</ref> Another Elder, the [[Contemplator]], allies with the space-pirate Captain [[Reptyl]] against the Silver Surfer, but is betrayed and apparently killed.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #12 (June 1988)</ref> The Contemplator is revealed to have survived - as a disembodied head - and goes on to attempt to rule the [[Kree]] Empire, but is seemingly destroyed by the peace-loving alien [[Cotati_(comics)|Cotati]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #20 (Feb. 1989); 25 - 27 (July - Sep. 1989) + 29 - 31 (Nov. - Dec. 1989)</ref> 

Several Elders are targeted by the Titan [[Thanos]], as they possess the [[Infinity Gems]]. The character humiliates each in turn (the Garderner is murdered) and captures the Gems.<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1 - 2 (Sep. - Oct. 1990)</ref> The Elder the Runner has an encounter with the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #17 (Dec. 1990)</ref> Quasar also confronts the Obliterator and Possessor and previously-unknown Elders the Explorer, the Judicator and the Caregiver. It is also revealed that the Contemplator killed by Reptyl was in fact a [[Skrull]], and not the true Contemplator.<ref>''Quasar'' #47 - 48 (Jun.- Jul. 1989)</ref>

The Grandmaster reappears and creates a new version of the Squadron Sinister. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the Wellspring of Power - an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities - the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they battle the superhero team the New Thunderbolts. The Grandmaster is defeated by [[Baron Zemo]], and the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15 - 16 (Jan. - Feb. 2006)+ ''Thunderbolts'' #102 - 108 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> Champion has an encounter with the heroine [[She-Hulk]] and aids her foe [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] by giving her the Power Gem currently in his possession. <ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 3, #7 - 12 (Nov. 2004 - Apr. 2005)</ref>

==The Power Primordial==
Each Elder of the Universe possesses a fraction of what is referred to as the '''Power Primordial''', remnants of the primordial energies of the [[Big Bang]] that still permeate the universe. <ref> ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #5 (Nov. 1987)</ref> [[The Power Primordial]] can be used to produce a wide range of effects, including augmentation of physical attributes (strength, durability, speed); molecular restructuring; creation of force fields; teleportation and numerous other abilities.
