[[Image:Elders of the Universe.jpg|frame|right|Left to right, down from the top: The Runner, The Gardener, The Collector, The Champion and The Grandmaster.]]The '''Elders of the Universe''' are a group of fictional characters in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Each is the last survivor of one of the first intelligent races that developed after the [[Big Bang]]. As such they have achieved virtual [[immortality]] as well as mastered advanced technologies. Every Elder has a different specialization, which they follow fanatically, apparently as a way to endure their eternal existence (one of them, The Collector's wife, eventually allowed herself to die because of it.) It must be noted that the Elders are not truly [[Cosmic Beings]] though some have achieved cosmic levels of power and knowledge. The heroes of Earth have encountered them in several occasions, sometimes as enemies and sometimes as allies.

The Elders, because of their links to the first era of the universe's history, have come to regard each other as brothers at least figuratively. Usually, they act independently but some have come together for certain schemes. It is not known how many Elders still remain; below is a list of the ones revealed so far.

Several of the Elders possessed some of the [[Infinity Gems]], though even they were unaware of their full power. All of them were stolen from them by [[Thanos]].

During the ''[[Contest of Champions]]'' miniseries, the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] challenged [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] to a game of strategy, that involved many of Earth's heroes, in order to resurrect his 'brother' Elder, The [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] (who had been recently killed by [[Korvac]]) and won; however he had to die for this to happen, which he agreed to. Later, however, the Grandmaster usurped control of Death's realm, but was stopped by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; this led to Death becoming angered with the Elders, preventing them from ever entering her realm - in other words, making them truly immortal- which had been the Grandmaster's true goal all along! 

Later, some of the Elders joined forces to try to kill [[Galactus]] and take his place and power as the balancing force of the Universe, but were thwarted by the [[Silver Surfer]] and his allies. The superhero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] later encountered several new Elders during his adventures in space.
