'''Vertigo''' is the name of a [[Mutant (fictional)|fictional mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  The character's first appearance was in ''Marvel Fanfare'' #1.

==Character biography==
Vertigo is a native of the [[Savage Land]] and obtained superhuman powers at a young age by [[genetic engineering]]. Her powers enable her to render a person  severely [[dizziness|dizzy]] and even [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]. She became a member of a group of mutants known as the [[Savage Land Mutates]], and in this group she first battled the [[X-Men]].

Later, she joined the [[Marauders]], a group of mutants working as assassins for a [[mad scientist]] named [[Mr. Sinister]]. The scientist wanted his assassins to destroy a large community of mutants, known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lived under [[New York City]]. They did succeed in annihilating a large number of the underground mutants. While the Marauders were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men, [[Thor (comics)|Thor]], [[X-Factor]], and [[Power Pack]].

Soon after this, Sinister sent Vertigo along with the other Marauders to fight the X-Men in New York City just before the extradimensional incursion known as the "Inferno".

Recently, Vertigo encountered the Avengers in the Savage Land. Vertigo used her powers to render them all unconscious and they were all taken captive briefly. This appearance was notable because her powers appeared to have been amplified considerably since her last appearance in the pages of the X-Men books. She also appeared to have blue skin now and red hair, although this could have been a trick of the light or even her powers disorienting the Avenger's senses.

====Powers and abilities====
The mutagenic process Vertigo has undergone has endowed her with the ability to effect those in her close vicinity with extreme disorientation or even unconsciousness. This may not seem like a very impressive ability, but with it she managed to single handedly subdue all of the Avengers.
