==History==
Vertigo is a native of the [[Savage Land]] who obtained superhuman powers at a young age by [[genetic engineering]]. Her powers enable her to render a person severely [[dizziness|dizzy]] and even [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]. She was initially a member of the [[Savage Land Mutates]], with whom she first battled the [[X-Men]] and [[Spider-Man]].

Later, she joined the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a group of mutants working as assassins for the enigmatic [[geneticist]] known as [[Mr. Sinister]]. Sinister wanted his assassins to destroy a large community of mutants, known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lived under [[New York City]], as he had deemed them genetically useless. The Marauders did succeed in annihilating a large number of the underground mutants. While the Marauders were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and [[Power Pack]]

Soon after this, Sinister sent Vertigo along with the other Marauders to fight the X-Men in New York City just before the extradimensional incursion known as the "Inferno". 
Her alliance with Sinister was short lived, as she soon rejoined her Mutate allies. Vertigo has been active with her original team, the Savage Land Mutates, with no explanation as to why she has left the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. 

Recently, Vertigo encountered the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in the Savage Land. Vertigo used her powers to render them all unconscious and they were all taken captive briefly. This appearance was notable because her powers appeared to have been amplified considerably since her last appearance in the pages of the [[X-Men]] books. She also appeared to have blue skin now and red hair, although this could have been a trick of the light or even her powers disorienting the Avengers' senses.

==Powers and abilities==
Vertigo is an artificially enhanced mutate who possesses the superhuman power to project waves of psionic energy into her environment which affect the nervous systems of other living beings, distorting their physical perceptions. This power induces effects ranging from mild disorientation and vertigo to unconsciousness. Vertigo can focus her power on one or more individuals or project it outward from herself in all directions, affecting everyone within her range of influence (the limit of which has never been defined).

==Other media==
Vertigo also appeared in the [[X-Men Animated Series]]. She was one of the followers of Mr. Sinister in the Savage Land. In the series, her powers were amplified after Mr. Sinister genetically modified her with Magneto's DNA. Later in the [[X-Men Animated Series]] she joins The [[Nasty Boys]] who were working for [[Mr. Sinister]] too.

==Notes==
* A character similar to Vertigo named [[Hypnotia]] appeared in the Marvel Action Hour Iron Man animated series.
* Vertigo, along with most of the other [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], is perpetually cloneable by Mr. Sinister, which explains how several of the Marauders have returned from the dead on numerous occasions. This has lead to speculation that there may actually be more than one Vertigo, which would explain her appearances with both the Marauders and the Savage Land Mutates.
