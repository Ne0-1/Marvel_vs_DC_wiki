===Fictional character biography===
Vertigo is a native of the [[Savage Land]] who obtained superhuman powers at a young age by [[genetic engineering]]. Her powers enable her to render a person severely [[dizziness|dizzy]] and even [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]. She was initially a member of the [[Savage Land Mutates]], with whom she first battled the [[X-Men]] and [[Spider-Man]].

====Marauders====
Later, she joined the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a group of mutants working as assassins for the enigmatic [[geneticist]] known as [[Mister Sinister]]. Sinister wanted his assassins to destroy a large community of mutants, known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lived under [[New York City]], as he had deemed them genetically useless. The Marauders did succeed in annihilating a large number of the underground mutants. While the Marauders were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and [[Power Pack]]

Soon after this, Sinister sent Vertigo along with the other Marauders to fight the X-Men in New York City just before the extradimensional incursion known as the "Inferno". 
Her alliance with Sinister was short-lived at that time, as she soon rejoined her Savage Land Mutate allies.

Vertigo encountered the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in the Savage Land. Vertigo used her powers to render them all unconscious and they were all taken captive briefly.

====Marauders/Cloned====
Vertigo is a member of Mr. Sinisterâ€™s Marauders as well as living in the Savage Land. As a Marauder, she has been killed and cloned various times. It is unclear whether the Vertigo that appears in the [[Savage Land]] is another clone or indeed the original Vertigo. It appears the Savage land Vertigo never left the savage Land and doesn't have any ties with the Marauders. Also the Marauder Vertigo clones are much more cruel.

====[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]] and Death====
Vertigo later reappears as a member of the reformed Marauders.  Whether this is the original or a clone has yet to be explored<ref>''X-Men'' #200</ref>. 

During [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], she aids the Marauders in search of the new mutant baby. After coming into a confrontation with [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and finally getting her hands on the baby, she joins the others in the final fight between the X-Men and X-Factor and the Marauders and the Acolytes, only to be eaten by [[Predator X]], who was teleported in by the mutant [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]]<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #46</ref>.

===Powers and abilities===
Vertigo is an artificially enhanced mutate who possesses the superhuman power to project waves of psionic energy into her environment which affect the nervous systems of other living beings, distorting their physical perceptions. This power induces effects ranging from mild disorientation and vertigo to unconsciousness. Vertigo can focus her power on one or more individuals, or project it outward from herself in all directions, affecting everyone within her range of influence (the limit of which has never been defined).
