== ''' Abraham Whistler''' ==

'''Abraham Whistler (More commonly known as just Whistler) is the mentor of the [[buddhist]] [[martial artist]] and [[vampire]] killer Blade.''' 


== '''His Story''' ==

'''WHISTLER:''' (EMOTIONLESS) "I had a family once...a wife and two daughters...then one night a drifter came by...a vampire. He toyed with them at first...tried to make me decide in which order they'd die...."


Whistler's wife and two daughters were killed by a [[vampire]] and ever since then he has made it his mission to hunt and kill as many vampires as he possibly can. Whistler is a cunning, determined and highly intelligent warrior. His sarcastic nature hides the pain and fills the hole left in his heart. In the 1998 film 'Blade' ([[Wesley Snipes]]) Whistler (Played by Kris Kristoffen) is portrayed as a sarcastic master of heavy weaponary, he is shown to have no mercy for vampires and ''familiars''

== '''How did he meet Blade?''' ==

As we know, Blade's mother was attacked by a Vamp, whilst she was carrying him, she was bitten minutes before delivering her son, Eric (He changed his name to Blade) 

Blade's genetically created thirst for blood took over him at puberty. By age thirteen he was living on the streets, feeding off the homeless. Whistler mistook him for a vampire and nearly killed him...until he realised what he was....a daywalker. He had the power of an immortal, their speed and strength - the ability to regenerate - and none of the vampire weaknesses. He had the soul of a human. Whistler created a serum, to control Blade's animal urgers for blood and began to train him. Blade found peace in the buddhist religion. The two became comrades...like "''father and son'' in arms" they share a strong, but unreadable bond. 

'''BLADE:''' (HIS EMOTION UNREADABLE, HIS EYES COVERD BY DARK SHADES) "We have a good arrangement....he makes the weapons...I use 'em!"
