The daughter of Kenjiro Fujikawa, the man who had taken over Stark's company during his stay in the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, she begins to date Stark largely as an act of rebellion to a father who disapproved of Stark.

Rumiko's romance with Stark enjoys many highs and lows.  She enjoys his jet-set lifestyle but finds he is often too boring and obsessed with his work.  At one point she engages in an infidelity with Stark's business rival and enemy, Tiberius Stone.  When Stark catches them together, the relationship ends.  In her remorse, Rumiko arranges for Stark to acquire sufficient stock in his old company that he can reclaim control of it.

Rumiko dies in ''[[Iron Man]]'' (3rd series) #87 when she is attacked by an impostor, Clarence Ward, wearing the Iron Man armor.
