Rumiko's romance with Stark enjoys many highs and lows. She enjoys his jet-set lifestyle but finds he is often too obsessed with his work and does not pay enough attention to her. This fact is made even worse due to all the problems facing Stark in his career as Iron Man at this point, such as his armor temporarily becoming [[Sentience|sentient]] and attempting to kill him, or the arrival of the [[Sons of Yinsen]], a group dedicated to the memory of the scientist who helped Stark develop the original Iron Man armor.

In remorse, Rumiko arranges for Stark to acquire sufficient stock in his old company that he can reclaim control of it.<ref>iron Man vol. 3 #37</ref> Tony and Rumiko get back together and are very stable for a while, until Tony takes the job as Secretary of Defense and becomes so busy that he neglects her and their relationship. <ref> Iron Man vol. 3</ref>{{Issue|date=December 2010}}
