'''Patriot''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], a [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] hero Jeffrey Mace, and the modern character Elijah Bradley.

==Jeffrey Mace==
{{mainarticle|Jeffrey Mace}}
The first Patriot, Jeffrey Mace, debuted in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #21 (July 1941).  He was a [[reporter]] who decided to become a superhero after seeing [[Captain America]] in action.

==Elijah Bradley==
{{spoiler}}
The second Patriot, who debuted in [[Young Avengers]] #1 (April 2005), is Elijah Bradley, grandson of [[Isaiah Bradley]], the first Captain America who, as introduced in ''Truth: Red, White and Black'' was part of the early Super Soldier Serum experiment which tested the serum on [[African American]] men before risking it on white men.  Elijah could not have inherited his grandfather's powers genetically because his mother was conceived before Isaiah's involvement with the experiment.  

When [[Iron Lad]] began his search for the next generation of Avengers, he came to the Bradley household searching for Isaiah's son Josiah ("Josiah X" of ''The Crew'').  However, Josiah had been missing for several months, and Iron Lad met Elijah instead.  Elijah claimed to have gained superpowers through an emergency [[blood transfusion]] from his grandfather, but this was a lie.  He was actually gaining powers artificially with MGH ([[Mutant Growth Hormone]]), an illegal street drug that causes brief periods of super-human abilities.  MGH has been demonstrated to promote irascibility in individuals.

Patriot became a founding member of the [[Young Avengers]], and his costume resembles that of [[Captain America|Captain America's]] deceased [[sidekick]], [[Bucky]].  He has an adversarial relationship with the team's ally [[Kate Bishop]].  Whether their verbal sparring is a result of unrealized attraction, a side effect of the drug or simple rudeness, remains to be seen.  Elijah was, however, happily surprised when Kate gifted him with Captain America's original, star-spangled, triangular [[shield]].

When the truth about Patriot's lack of superpowers was revealed, he quit the Young Avengers team.  Whether he will return is as yet unrevealed.

Afterwards, the Young Avengers gathered to convince Eli that he should return, arguing that he was the only person capable of leading them, even without his powers.
