'''Patriot''' is the name of two [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]:  the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] hero '''Jeffrey Mace''' and the modern-day character '''Elijah Bradley'''.

==Jeffrey Mace==
{{main|Jeffrey Mace}}
The first Patriot, Jeffrey Mace, created by [[writer]] [[Ray Gill]] and [[artist]] [[Bill Everett]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Human Torch (Golden Age)|The Human Torch]]'' #4 (Spring 1941; misnumbered #3 on cover). He was a [[reporter]] who became a costumed adventurer after seeing [[Captain America]] in action, and was a member of the [[World War II]] superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]]. The Patriot himself became the [[Captain America#Late 1940s.E2.80.931950s.E2.80.94After Steve Rogers|third '''Captain America''']].

==Elijah Bradley==
{{Spoiler}}
The second Marvel Universe character to use the name Patriot debuted in ''[[Young Avengers]]'' #1 (April 2005): Elijah Bradley, grandson of [[Isaiah Bradley]], the black Captain America. Isaiah had received his powers (in the [[miniseries]] ''[[Truth: Red, White and Black]]'') as part of an early [[Super Soldier]] Serum experiment tested on [[African-American]] men in an attempt to reproduce the formula lost after the experiments on Steve Rogers. Elijah's  mother was conceived before her father Isaiah's involvement with the experiment, however, so Elijah could not have inherited his grandfather's powers genetically. 

===Recruitment===
When [[Iron Lad]] began his search for the next generation of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], he came to the Bradley household in search of Isaiah's son Josiah ([[Josiah X]] of ''The Crew''). However, Josiah had been missing for several months, and Iron Lad met Elijah instead. Elijah claimed to have gained superpowers through an emergency [[blood transfusion]] from his grandfather, but this was untrue. He later gained his powers artificially with [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] (MGH), an illegal street drug that causes brief periods of superhuman abilities. MGH has been demonstrated to promote irascibility in individuals.

===Young Avengers===
Patriot became a founding member of the Young Avengers. His costume resembles that of [[Captain America]]'s 1940s [[sidekick]], [[Bucky]]. He has an adversarial relationship with fellow teammate [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)]], who nonetheless gave him Captain America's original, star-spangled, triangular [[Captain America's shield|shield]].

When the truth about Elijah's lack of superpowers was revealed, Elijah quit the team. He returned after [[Hulkling]] was kidnapped by the [[Super-Skrull]], and the other Young Avengers convinced him he was the only one of them capable of leading the team, even without his powers. In ''Young Avengers'' #11-12, Patriot was gravely wounded by a [[Kree]] warrior when he jumped in front of a blast meant for Captain America, and received a [[blood transfusion]] from his grandfather, Isaiah, which transmitted the Super-Soldier abilities to him in earnest.

==Powers and abilities==
While secretly using his specially concocted MGH formula, Elijah possessed agility, strength, speed, endurance, and reaction-time superior to that of normal Super Soldiers like his grandfather and Captain America, but at a heavy physical and mental cost. After receiving a blood transfusion from his grandfather, Elijah developed genuine Super Soldier abilities, including super strength and super hearing.

In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2, Elijah appears to possess the full physical abilities of a Super Soldier. He is able to outrun a helicopter, shrug off a hail of tranquilizer darts, jump several hundred feet through the air, and survive a massive explosion.

===Equipment===
Patriot carries a replica of [[Captain America's shield|Captain America's original, star-spangled, triangular shield]], similar to the unpainted one originally carried into battle by his grandfather Isaiah. He also carries white metallic [[Shuriken#Hira shuriken|throwing stars]] patterned after those on the [[American flag]].

==Drug use==
Writer Allan Heinberg has stated that Bradley's drug usage is based on his own history, stating [http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=328]
{{cquote|Since I had personally had a recent (and regrettable) experience with [[steroid]]s, steroid use was something I wanted to write about. For better or worse, Eli’s race was never a factor in those storytelling decisions, and I hope that by the end of this arc, Eli’s story will be an inspiring one to all our readers.}}
