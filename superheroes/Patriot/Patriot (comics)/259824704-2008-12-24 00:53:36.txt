The second Marvel Universe character to use the name Patriot debuted in ''[[Young Avengers]]'' #1 (April 2005): Elijah Bradley, grandson of [[Isaiah Bradley]], the black Captain America. Isaiah had received his powers (in the [[limited series]] ''[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]'') as part of an early [[Super Soldier]] Serum experiment tested on [[African-American]] men in an attempt reproduce the formula lost after being used to turn Steve Rogers into Captain America. Elijah's mother was conceived before her father Isaiah's involvement with the experiment, however, so Elijah could not have inherited his grandfather's powers genetically. 

===Fictional character biography===
When [[Iron Lad]] began his search for the next generation of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], he came to the Bradley household in search of Isaiah's son Josiah ([[Josiah X]] of [[The Crew (comics)|The Crew]]). However, Josiah had been missing for several months, and Iron Lad met Elijah instead. Elijah claimed to have gained superpowers through an emergency [[blood transfusion]] from his grandfather, but this was untrue. He later gained his powers artificially with [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] (MGH), an illegal street drug that causes brief periods of superhuman abilities. MGH has been demonstrated to promote irascibility in individuals.

Patriot became a founding member of the Young Avengers. The public believed his costume resembled that of [[Captain America]]'s 1940s [[sidekick]], [[Bucky]], but he revealed that his costume is a redesign of his grandfather's. He has an adversarial relationship with fellow teammate [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)]], who nonetheless gave him Captain America's original, star-spangled, triangular [[Captain America's shield|shield]].

When the truth about Elijah's lack of superpowers was revealed, Elijah quit the team. He returned after [[Hulkling]] was kidnapped by the [[Super-Skrull]], and the other Young Avengers convinced him he was the only one of them capable of leading the team, even without his powers. Patriot was later gravely wounded by a [[Kree]] warrior when he jumped in front of a blast meant for Captain America, and received a [[blood transfusion]] from his grandfather, Isaiah, which granted him the abilities afforded by the Super Soldier serum.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #11-12</ref>

===Civil War===
Eli joined Captain America's Secret Avengers during the Civil War. Patriot led his team to assist the Runaways after they were attacked by the government. The Young Avengers and the Runaways worked together when two of their members were captured, and the Runaways decided to stay out of the mix in the war. Patriot managed to keep most of his team together, but Stature decided to join Iron Man's side.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Patriot_%28Elijah_Bradley%29 Elijah Bradley's profile (marvel.com/universe)]</ref>

Eli later seeks out the [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]] (who he had earlier met during the Civil War<ref>''Winter Soldier: Winter Kills #1''</ref>) to discuss the meaning of being a patriot at a time when he disagrees with registration and much of the way America is being run, and the two have a heartfelt chat about America as an idea and the original Patriot, Jeffrey Mace.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents'' #1</ref>
===Secret Invasion===
Eli and the other Young Avengers were the first team to respond to the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] of [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]]. Despite their valiant efforts, and the aid of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] cadets, they are all beaten.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
While secretly using his specially concocted MGH formula, Elijah possessed agility, strength, speed, endurance, and reaction-time superior to that of normal Super Soldiers like his grandfather and Captain America, but at a heavy physical and mental cost. After receiving a blood transfusion from his grandfather, Elijah developed genuine Super Soldier abilities where his strength, stamina, speed, reflexes, agility, durability, and senses are at the pinnacle of human ability.

In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2, Elijah appears to possess the full physical abilities of a Super Soldier. He is able to outrun a helicopter, shrug off a hail of tranquilizer darts, jump a hundred feet through the air, and survive a massive explosion <ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>.

Patriot carries a replica of [[Captain America's shield|Captain America's original, star-spangled, triangular shield]], similar to the unpainted one originally carried into battle by his grandfather Isaiah. He also carries white metallic [[Shuriken#Hira shuriken|throwing stars]] patterned after those on the [[American flag]].

==Drug use==
Writer Allan Heinberg has stated that Bradley's drug usage is based on his own history<ref>[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=328 brokenfrontier.com]</ref>, stating 
{{cquote|Since I had personally had a recent (and regrettable) experience with [[steroid]]s, steroid use was something I wanted to write about. For better or worse, Eli’s race was never a factor in those storytelling decisions, and I hope that by the end of this arc, Eli’s story will be an inspiring one to all our readers.}}

==Other versions==
====Exiles: Days of Then and Now====
Patriot was seen as a member of [[Quentin Quire]]'s surviving team of heroes, who were against the [[Annihilation Wave]], in which their leader was a banished [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].
