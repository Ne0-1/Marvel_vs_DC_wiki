'''X-Statix''' was the name of a [[fiction]]al team of [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]]es in [[Marvel Comics]], specifically designed to be [[irony|ironic]] [[mass media|media]] superstars. The team, created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Mike Allred]], first appeared in ''[[X-Force]]'' #116, and originally went by the name '''X-Force'''.

==About the series==
In [[2001]], the [[X-Men]] family of titles were being revamped by the newly apointed [[Marvel Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]], with the aim to make the titles more critically and commercially successful.
Quesada appointed writer [[Peter Milligan]], best know for his [[surreal]], [[post-modernist]] comics such as ''[[Rogan Gosh]]'' and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'', and ''[[Madman (comics)|Madman]]'' artist [[Mike Allred]], as the new creative team for ''[[X-Force]]'' from issue 116.
''[[X-Force]]'' prior to Millgan and Allred's first issue was a formulaic superhero title, which sold well but had rarely been the critical success Quesada wanted.

From their first issue of ''X-Force'' things were changed right away, gone was the previous team and replacing them were characters more like [[popstar|popstars]] or [[reality tv]] contestants than traditional superheroes. The title was laced with Milligan's [[satirical]] take on the superhero team as well as being [[cynical]] of the genre generally. Milligan and Allred would regularly play with killing of the titles characters, in their first issue they wiped out all the team with only two exceptions.

This dramatic revision of the series was not universally accepted, many readers wanted "their" X-Force back, a comment Milligan later [[parodied]] in the pages of the title. However sales had increased, and the titles was recieving mainstream media coverage in the likes of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. 

''X-Force'' was cancelled with issue 129 so it could become ''X-Statix'' and it restarted from issue 1. ''X-Statix'' carried on with the same themes and tone to ''X-Force'' but grew increasingly satirical in it's targets. 
In issue 13 Milligan had planned to use [[Princess Diana]] in a storyline in ''X-Statix'' which featured her returning from the dead as a mutant superhero. News of this leaked out to the media and there followed a series of objections, most notably from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[tabloid newspaper]] ''[[The Daily Mail]]''.
Quesada and Marvel announced that they would alter the character of Princess Diana, replacing her with a fictional pop star, [[Henrietta Hunter]]. 
Whether Marvel and Milligan intended to do this from the start is unknown but the effect worked and sales peaked during this time.
However this was not to last long; after a story arc pitting X-Statix against [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], low sales prompted cancellation with issue 26 published in [[2004]]. In this last issue Milligan and Allred kill the entire team in one last parody of the superhero genre while tieing up the remaining plot threads of the title.

In January of [[2006]], [[Marvel Comics]] is set to release a new series ''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'', where she is paired with [[Doctor Strange]] to combat a series of villians that have returned from the dead. '''Mister Sensitive''' is also said to make a reappearance in the [[limited series]] albeit in an [[zombie |undead]] form.

==Detailed Roster==
The team was a group of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants put together and marketed to be superstars first by the mysterious "Coach" and later by media mogul Spike Freeman. Some of the members included:
[[image:Xforce116.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[X-Force]]''#116, by Mike Allred.]]
*'''[[Orphan (comics)|Orphan]]''', aka '''Mister Sensitive''', the team's ''de facto'' leader, a suicidal mutant with purple skin and two [[antenna]]e protruding from his forehead who possessed heightened senses, superhuman speed, and the ability to levitate.
*'''[[Anarchist (comics)|Anarchist]]''', the team's self-proclaimed "token" [[African American]], whose [[acid]]-like [[sweat]] enabled him to fire energy bolts.
*'''[[U-Go Girl]]''', a blue-skinned, redhead, [[narcoleptic]] teleporter
*'''[[Phat (comics)|Phat]]''', an openly gay [[Eminem]] pastiche who could harden, soften and increase the size of any part of his body by expanding his [[subcutaneous]] fat layer.
*'''[[Vivisector]]''', a bookish scholar who could transform into a [[wolf]]-like creature with enhanced senses, speed, agility, and razor sharp fangs and claws, and who briefly became Phat's lover.
*'''[[Dead Girl]]''', a literal dead girl who could reform her body and control its parts when dismembered, and could "read" the memories of dead bodies.
*'''[[Venus Dee Milo]]''', whose body was made entirely of crackling red energy that allowed her to teleport, project concussive blasts of energy, and heal minor wounds.
*'''[[El Guapo (comics)|El Guapo]]''', a sexy male mutant with a flying skateboard that seemed to have a mind of its own.
*'''[[Doop (comics)|Doop]]''', a green, floating spheroid creature of unknown origins who spoke in a "language" all his own (respresented in text by a special [[font]]), and who served as X-Force's [[cameraman]].  It was hinted many times that he might have been manipulating the team or that he was trying to control them in some clandestine way but nothing was ever resolved or proven.
*'''[[Bloke (comics)|Bloke]]''', a mutant with the ability to change the color of his skin, like a [[chameleon]]; certain color changes would enhance his strength.  He revealed himself to be gay shortly before his death.
*'''[[Saint Anna (comics)|Saint Anna]]''', an Irish-Argentinian mutant with the ability to levitate and control the motion of objects as well as physically and mentally heal others
*'''[[Henrietta Hunter]]''', an inexplicably reanimated woman with enhanced physical abilities
*'''[[Spike (comics)|Spike]]''', a controversial African American character who made fun of Anarchist for being white inside, even though his skin is black.  He is capable of extending then spikes from his body or launching them as projectiles.
*'''[[Fan Boy]]''', the self-proclaimed greatest fan of X-statix, he basically blackmailed his way into gaining team membership. When Orphan had had enough of him, he conscripted long-time ally Lacuna to inject him with a serum that would stop his heart.  He had limited reality warping powers and some of the acts he performed were: illusion casting, animating dead bodies, rearranging items on a molecular level, creating explosions, and healing injuries.

*[[Lacuna (comics)|Lacuna]], a young girl named Woodstock who set out to prove that she was worthy of membership into the then X-force by playing pranks on the members with the help of her powers. Even though she was more than capable, Orphan rejected her but on occasion would call upon her for help.  When Orphan finally came to her to offer her membership, she declined, prefering instead to take up a spot as a [[talk show]] host where she would expose the secrets of the stars.  Her powers allow her to walk between the moments of time while everything else remains still.
===X-Force===
In Milligan and Allred's first issue of ''X-Force'', nearly the entire team was killed off in an incident called the Boyz R Us massacre.  This precursory team, of which only '''U-Go Girl''' and '''Anarchist''' survived, also included:

*'''Battering Ram''', who had superhuman strength, and durability as well as a thick skull which sported two ram-like horns and purple skin
*'''Gin Genie''', who could direct [[seismic]] energy from her body but only when she had consumed alcohol
*'''La Nuit''', a Frenchman who could generate a cloak of dark energy around him that would disperse light and control objects
*'''Plazm''', a living, lighter than air liquid man who could control metabolic functions upon contact with another or through a spray from his hands
*'''Zeitgeist''', who could vomit an acidic ooze from his mouth and was the leader of the team
*'''Sluk''', who has a face composed of tentacles
