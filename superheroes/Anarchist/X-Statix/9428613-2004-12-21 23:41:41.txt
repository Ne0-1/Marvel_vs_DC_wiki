'''X-Statix''' was the name of a [[fiction]]al team of [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]]es in [[Marvel Comics]], specifically designed to be [[irony|ironic]] [[mass media|media]] superstars. The team, created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Mike Allred]], first appeared in ''[[X-Force]]'' #116, and originally went by the name '''X-Force'''.

The team was a group of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants put together and marketed to be superstars first by the mysterious "Coach" and later by media mogul Spike Freeman. Milligan and Alfred routinely killed off characters as a running gag (nearly the entire team was killed in the first issue), but some of the longer-running members included:

*'''Orphan''', aka '''Mister Sensitive''', the team's ''de facto'' leader, a suicidal mutant with purple skin and two [[antenna]]e protruding from his forehead who possessed heightened senses, superhuman speed, and the ability to levitate.
*'''Anarchist''', the team's self-proclaimed "token" [[African American]], whose [[acid]]-like [[sweat]] enabled him to fire energy bolts.
*'''U-Go Girl''', a blue-skinned redhead who could teleport but was weakened after doing so.
*'''Phat''', an openly gay [[Eminem]] pastiche who could harden, soften and increase the size of any part of his body
*'''Vivisector''', a bookish scholar who could transform into a [[wolf]]-like creature, and who briefly became Phat&#8217;s lover
*'''Dead Girl''', a literal dead girl who could reform her body and control its parts when dismembered, and could "read" the memories of dead bodies.
*'''Venus Dee Milo''', whose body was made entirely of crackling red energy that allowed her to teleport.
*'''Doop''', a green, floating spheroid creature of unknown origins who spoke in a "language" all his own (respresented in text by a special [[font]]), and who served as X-Force&#8217;s [[cameraman]]

This dramatic revision of the series was not universally accepted, but many readers applauded the book for its black humor and its daring. ''X-Force'' ended with issue #129 ([[2002]]), when the team was renamed X-Statix, and the series restarted under that title with ''X-Statix'' #1. ''X-Statix'' lasted until issue #26 ([[2004]]); low sales prompted cancellation, and the cancellation of the series prompted the death of the entire team.
