==Fictional character biography==
Damon Dran is a munitions magnate.  Terrified of a nuclear war, he had himself transformed into a superhuman "Indestructible Man". He has fought both [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].  He has employed the [[Blue Talon]] and hired the Zulu warrior N'Kama to capture the Black Widow.

[[Americop]]'s investigations led him to the New Orleans mansion of Damon Dran. Although initially subdued by a gas grenade attack and imprisoned alongside [[Captain America]], the determined Americop broke free and killed several of Dran's mercenaries. He shot down Dran's retreating helicopter before escaping. He mistakenly believed that he had killed Damon.<ref>''Captain America'' (1st series) #430</ref>
