'''Master Pandemonium''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He was an [[actor]] who lost an arm in a car crash, and made a pact with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to regain his limb; Mephisto instead took the man's other three limbs, then replaced them all with [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]]ic grafts.  Master Pandemonium could shed his limbs and have them turn into demons, as well as summon demons through the [[pentagram]]-shaped hole in his chest, and breathe out hellfire.  He has come into conflict with [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], the [[West Coast Avengers]], and the [[Fantastic Four]].
