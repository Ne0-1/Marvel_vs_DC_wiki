'''Carnage''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}, a [[supervillain]] and adversary of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].  Created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #361 ([[1992#April|April 1992]]).

Carnage is the result of a [[spawning]] of a separate [[Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture|extraterrestrial]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] worn by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].  This symbiote bonded with [[serial killer]] Cletus Kasady, creating one of Spider-Manâ€™s most murderous adversaries.
{{spoiler}}
==Fictional character history==
Carnage was once [[serial killer]] Cletus Kasady, and became Carnage after merging with the offspring of the [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] called [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] during a prison breakout.  He was originally conceived as a purely villainous counterpart to Venom, who was being reenvisioned as an [[anti-hero]].

His past is uncertain and information given by Kasady himself is often contradictory. Kasady claims his mother tried to kill him after she caught him torturing her dog. She was apparently beaten to death by Kasady's father, who received no defence from his son during his trial. ''Venom; Carnage Unleashed #1''. Kasady however seemed to care for his mother, causing him to dig up her grave in ''Maximum Carnage'', totally contradicting his prior account in which he took glee in her death.  He also claims he killed his grandmother when he was younger, pushing her down a flight of stairs. By his early twenties, he had been convicted of 11 murders, although he bragged about committing dozens.  

Kasady, albeit having a stronger bond to his symbiote than Eddie Brock did, has been separated from and re-bonded with the symbiote several times.  The Carnage symbiote, attracted to stronger hosts, has attempted to bond with [[Ben Reilly]] (Spider-Man at the time) to become [[Spider-Carnage]], and the [[Silver Surfer]] (Creating the insane and vastly powerful [[Carnage Cosmic]]).  Later, Venom decided to reabsorb the Carnage symbiote "for good."  Without the symbiote, Kasady retained the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees (albeit as a powerless human).  Soon after, Kasady found an exact replica of the symbiote in the [[Negative Zone]].  How this symbiote is an identical copy, or where it came from, has yet to be explained.  However, the issues in which Kasady discovered the replica had references to the ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' TV series which had been airing at the time and which featured the Carnage Symbiote as one of its villains.  In this same issue, Spider-Man himself briefly gained the costume the animated version of him from that series wore.

Perhaps the most famous storyline in which Carnage appears is the 1993 Spider-Man event '''''[[Maximum Carnage]]'''''.  Carnage, and a cadre of psychotic super-villains (consisting of [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]]) overtook New York, but were driven back by Spider-Man, Venom, the Black Cat, and several other heroes.

In the 1996 "Web of Carnage" storyline, the Carnage symbiote escapes from the [[Ravencroft]] Institute where Cletus Kasady is incarcerated, seeking a stronger host.  It takes over [[Ben Reilly]], who had recently replaced Peter Parker as Spider-Man. Reilly has little previous experience with symbiotes, and is unprepared for an enemy that is immune to his spider-sense.  Together, they become Spider-Carnage, and the symbiote attempts to force him, both mentally and physically, to kill Peter Parker (then powerless), and other innocent people. Reilly barely escapes the symbiote's control with help from [[Dr. Ashley Kafka]] and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], the administrators of Ravencroft.

Carnage starred in the miniseries ''Venom vs. Carnage'' in [[2005]].  The Carnage symbiote [[asexual reproduction|spawned]] a "child" symbiote, which he tried to kill without success.  The "child" later bonded with police officer Patrick Mulligan.  Carnage felt nothing but hate for the young creature and attempted to kill it, while [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] defended it (feeling protective of his "grandchild").  Venom named the new symbiote [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]. Mulligan has since attempted to steer the symbiote towards heroism instead of murder.

Carnage was one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from The Raft in ''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1-2.  The [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] flew Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere and ripped him apart.

==Ultimate Carnage== 

{{spoiler}}

[[Image:usm62.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Carnage on the Cover of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #62. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

The [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] version of Carnage is very different from the [[Marvel Universe]] version, although both characters were designed by [[Mark Bagley]].  The title of the arc, ''Carnage'', referred only to the path of murder the creature embarked upon; the creature is never named.

[[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Connors]] had created a rejuvenating symbiotic suit using the work of Spider-Man's late father [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]: the  [[Venom (Ultimate)|Venom "suit"]].  After a series of mishaps, the suit went missing, and Connors worried that years of work had been destroyed.  But a new opportunity presented itself.  After an injury, Peter Parker sought out Connors' help in treating his wounds, and Connors ended up with a sample of Spider-Man's genetically altered blood.  He used the blood to create a new organism based partly on the Venom project.  Using DNA from himself, the Venom project, and Peter, Connors developed a unique, self-regenerating form of life.  This blood-red creature grew from a few inches long to the size of a child very rapidly, and quickly escaped.  The creature drained the fluids from several victims, rapidly increasing its mass and strength.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Carnage_Gwen.jpg|left|thumb|Carnage kills Gwen Stacy.]] -->Remembering memories from Peter, the Carnage creature went to the Parker residence. It surprised and killed Gwen Stacy. Soon afterwards, it found itself in combat with Peter Parker. Reasoning that the creature was not actually alive (and alarmed at its gradual resemblance to his own father), Peter threw it into a smokestack, where the Carnage creature apparently met its end.

In the [[video game]] ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', another Carnage creature was created when hostile scientists activated the dormant Venom particles in Peter's body.  The particles overtook him, and he battled Venom.  The Carnage suit is quickly absorbed by Venom, whose [[host (biology)|host]], ([[Eddie Brock]]) gains full control of the Venom suit.

Recently, someone claiming to be [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy]] returned.  She retained no memory of her death, only remembering waking up in a hospital room.  When a small army of S.H.I.E.L.D. Spider Slayers arrived to take Peter into custody, the new 'Gwen' became agitated and transformed into Carnage, or a creature similar to it.  She (or ''it'') then attacked the gathered Spider Slayers.  After a prolonged and destructive rampage through the Slayers, the AI on the Slayer drones manage to adapt to Carnage's biological data, and neutralize the creature by changing it back into 'Gwen' with a series of power energy blasts.  Notably, this 'Gwen' version appeared to have white teeth in a similar manner to the 616 Venom rather than Carnage's traditional black, red or yellow fangs.

Solicitations for the Epilogue of The Ultimate Clone Saga - issue #105 - state that the fate of 'Gwen Stacy' will be decided by Nick Fury.

==Powers and abilities==
{{main|Symbiote (comics)}}
[[Image:Spiderman037.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Cover to ''Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #37.  Carnage using his costume as a blade.]]

The alien symbiote suit is made of tough, flexible fibers of organic polymer which have the ability to mimic any type of clothing whatsoever (typically colored black or red in Kasady's case).  It also makes him undetectable (like Venom) to Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]].  Similarly, Venom's ability to "detect" Kasady's presence can be blocked by the suit.

In addition, the suit gives Carnage the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet, a power which the symbiote inherited, via Venom, from Spider-Man.  Also adapted from Spider-Man is the ability to project a web-like substance from his body.  Unlike Venom, Kasady can also separate parts of the symbiote costume from himself and use them as weapons, but they crumble to dust after about ten seconds.  Carnage's symbiote originally had the power to "see" from any part of itself and relay the visual information to Kasady, although he appears to have lost this power.

The living costume endows Carnage with superhuman strength, superior to that of both Spider-Man and Venom.  Originally, he was stronger than Spider-Man and equal to Venom.  Carnage also possesses levels of superhuman agility and reaction time comparable to those of Spider-Man.

Cletus Kasady is also a formidable hand-to-hand combatant and a merciless killer.

==Contradictions==
Various stories often contradict one another as to whether the symbiote is permanently bonded with Kasady's [[DNA]], due most likely to the symbiote's apparent death after its first appearance.  In ''Maximum Carnage'', Kasady himself indicated that the symbiote had mutated his blood to allow Kasady to produce a copy of the suit, but the suit was trapped in Kasady's body until he could release it from his bloodstream.  During the Spider-Carnage arc, the symbiote independenly chooses to leave Kasady and bond with Ben Reilly.  Kasady rapidly ages and his body quickly deteriorates. In this state, Kasady was barely able to function, let alone be a threat.  The symbiote bonded with him again in time to save his life.  However, in the story arc where Venom ate the symbiote, Kasady did not deteriorate, but this was left unexplained.  He was later to gain another symbiote in the Negative Zone, but this story was quickly forgotten.  It is generally presumed that Kasady simply regenerated the biomass of the original symbiote while in the Negative Zone and that Kassady and the Carnage symbiote are merely one organism on a genetic level.  The symbiote that spawned Toxin was clearly the original Carnage symbiote, due to Venom referring to the Toxin symbiote as his 'grandson'.

Carnage was once sealed in what the Silver Surfer described "an unbreakable shell." In later issues Cassady is seen in prison along with his symbiote in a prison cell without any sign of a shell.

==Appearances in other media==
'''Television'''<br>

In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Carnage's creation was orchestrated by the evil [[demon]] [[Dormammu]].  The Venom symbiote had previously been launched into space aboard a probe by Spider-Man, but, learning that it was on the verge of [[asexual reproduction|asexually reproducing]], Dormammu had his agent, [[Baron Mordo]], bring the probe back to Earth.  When the recently arrested Cletus Kasady witnessed Brock's reunion with his symbiote, he was soon offered the chance to merge with the symbiote's spawn.  Becoming Carnage, he was sent out to capture enough "life energy" from human beings to provide Dormammu the strength to enter our world.  This version of Carnage was quite noticeably tamer and less violent than his appearances in the comics, merely draining life from his victims, which was later restored, rather than killing them outright (although he still took a perverse pleasure in the action, and referred to it as if it were feeding).  He was eventually defeated by Spider-Man and Venom, as he, Venom and Dormammu were sent hurling through a dimensional vortex.  He was voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]].

In the series finale of the show, a Carnage symbiote - perhaps the original, perhaps not, or maybe a combination of Carnage and Venom or not - emerged from a dimensional portal into an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]], and bonded with the extremely emotionally unstable Peter Parker of that world.  The joining of the two created the insane Spider-Carnage, who was threatening to destroy all reality and thus all existence using an invention mixing the dimensional warp generator and a huge bomb to destroy every dimension consecutively.  The real Peter Parker, assisted by several other Spider-Men from other universes, were able to convince Spider-Carnage to fight the symbiote off. 

[[Image:carng1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carnage in [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]].]]

This was done by bringing in Peter's [[Uncle Ben]] from a reality where he was not murdered.  Peter knew the symbiote was influencing Spider-Carnage to commit this genocide, since they were in fact the same person and Peter could never kill another human being.  Uncle Ben was able to convince Spider-Carnage he could still be a hero as long as he had the courage to reject the symbiote.  However, the Carnage symbiote was too powerfully bonded and despite Spider-Carnage's best efforts, he could not get rid of it, so he threw himself into a dangerously unstable warp hole where he was killed.

The Carnage that took over the Spider-Man in the Scarlet Spider's reality was likely a different symbiote, as he never made any mentioning about Venom, and Carnage appears in [[Spider-Man Unlimited]], the show that would be a spin-off to the previous Spider-Man show.  

One of the show's makers in ''Spider-Man: The Animated Series'' confirmed if the show were to have a sixth season before its finale, Carnage would have been Jack the Ripper in a Colonial England as Spider-Man finds Mary Jane, after she fell into a dimensional portal in the third season finale.[http://members.aol.com/drg4/semper.html]

===Carnage in Film===
Carnage is consistently a name that appears on rumor lists for the Spider-Man movie franchise. He could possibly be the fourth villain in [[Spider-man 3]], though there has yet to be any evidence to suggest this. It has also been rumoured that May Parker, the aunt of Peter Parker, would take on the role of carnage after the IMDB listed Rosemary Harris, who plays the aunt, as having the dual role of Aunt May/Carnage (though this appears to have been a case of vandalism).[http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/2747.asp]


An aborted ''Venom'' film, written by [[David Goyer]] for New Line Pictures, would have featured Carnage as the primary antagonist, but the script was never produced and the rights for the Venom character reverted to [[Sony]].[http://www.comics2film.com/ProjectFrame.php?f_id=217]

'''Video games'''<br>

* Carnage is an unbeatable foe in ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' for the [[Game Boy]].  He cannot be killed or defeated, but must be avoided at all costs.
* Carnage appears with [[The Rhino]] as a boss in ''Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge'' for the [[Super Nintendo]] & the [[Sega Genesis]].  He awaits Spider-Man at the end of the second level and has attacks identical to Spider-Man's.
* Carnage appeared in both ''[[Spider-Man & Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'' (for the [[Sega Genesis]] and the Super Nintendo) and its sequel, ''[[Spider-Man & Venom: Separation Anxiety]]'' as the final boss.
* In the [[PlayStation]]/[[Nintendo 64]]/[[Sega Dreamcast]] ''Spider-Man'' video game, Carnage was again one of the final bosses.  He functioned as a subordinate of [[Doctor Octopus]] while Ock maintained the appearance of a reformed Dr. Otto Octavius.  Spider-Man deduced that Ock was lying and while he first took on Ock, Venom and Carnage squared off where Carnage gained the reputation of the winner, beating Venom and wounding him badly just after Spider-Man defeated Ock.  Venom, unable to speak clearly since he was brutally beaten by his symbiote "son", tried to warn Spider-Man that Carnage would attack, but Spider-Man couldn't understand him and he and Carnage battled near the conclusion of the game.  After defeating him, the Carnage symbiote slithered away from a knocked-out Cletus Kasady and joined with Ock, creating the hybrid of the two, aptly named "Monster-Ock".  Spider-Man fled from both Ock and the explosive destruction of Ock's base.  The fire was sufficient to disable the hybrid villain, having Ock knocked unconscious and Spider-Man took him to jail after both of them were saved from Ock's blowing lair by the Black Cat, Captain America and Venom and the symbiote slunk back to Kasady (presuming he managed to escape the explosion).
* In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, Ultimate Carnage is one of the final bosses for the Venom portion of the game.  Spider-Man is captured and injected with a serum that stimulated the inactive Venom-suit particles in his body, turning him into the Ultimate Spider-Carnage.  Venom and Spider-Carnage battle and Venom devours Spider-Carnage, assimilating the rest of the Venom suit and freeing Spider-Man.
*Carnage is the main villain in the SNES game titled Maximum Carnage. For various levels either Spider-Man or Venom battle against Carnage who becomes increasingly difficult after each battle. Plus after the credits you get to fight him one more time.
