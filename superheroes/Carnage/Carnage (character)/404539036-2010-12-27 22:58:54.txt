'''Carnage''' ('''Cletus Kasady''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #344 (March 1991), and was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]]. In 2009, Carnage was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html Carnage is number 90] [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.</ref>

==Publication history==
Writer [[David Michelinie]] created Carnage to be a darker version of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]<ref>''Spider-Man: Carnage''</ref> intending to have Venom's human alter ego, [[Eddie Brock]], be killed off in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom's popularity increased, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character; a total psychopath who unlike Venom had no sense of honor. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45</ref> and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage."  Carnage's human component, Cletus Kasady was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]] who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774|title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread)|accessdate=2007-06-24|author=Erik Larsen|date=2007-03-27|publisher=Image Comics Community}}</ref> [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote.

Cletus Kasady was introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344 and first appears as Carnage in issue #360. He is the main villain in the 1993  "''[[Maximum Carnage]]''" crossover, a 14-part storyline crossover that spanned through all the ''Spider-Man'' titles. In 1996, two one-shot comics centered entirely around Carnage were released, entitled ''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' and ''Carnage: It's A Wonderful Life'', both of which expand on his character.

After an appearance early in ''New Avengers'', the character was presumed killed and went through a nearly six year absence from comics. However, a new limited series titled ''Carnage'' features the symbiote's return, where it will find a new female host to replace the deceased Kasady.<ref>http://comics.ign.com/articles/110/1108393p1.html</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Cletus Kasady had a troubled childhood: he killed his grandmother by pushing her down a flight of stairs, and [[cruelty to animals|tortured]] his mother's dog. His mother then tried to kill Cletus, and was apparently beaten to the brink of death by Kasady's father, who received no defense from Kasady during his trial. As an [[orphan]], Kasady was sent to the St. Estes Home for Boys, where his [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] behavior made him the target of abuse from both the other orphans and the staff. Kasady gained revenge by murdering the disciplinarian administrator, pushing a girl who refused to date him in front of a moving bus, and burning down the orphanage.

===Finding the symbiote===
Kasady becomes a [[serial killer]]. He is captured and sent to [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ryker's Island|Ryker's Island]] prison where he shares a [[prison cell|cell]] with [[Eddie Brock]], who had lost the [[Symbiote (comics)|alien symbiote]] that transformed him into the supervillain [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. Brock's symbiote soon returns and bonds with him again, and unwittingly leaves behind the symbiote's offspring; the symbiotes reproduce asexually, once per generation; the children are then of no consequence to the parent, hence Brock's symbiote felt no need to inform Brock of the existence of its offspring. The new symbiote enters Kasady's bloodstream through a cut and bonds with his blood, transforming him into Carnage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344-345</ref>  He escapes prison,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #359</ref> and begins a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, writes "Carnage Rules" on the walls with his own blood. He is found by [[Spider-Man]], though the hero proves to be no match for Carnage's powers. In desperation, Spider-Man makes a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #360-363</ref> Carnage is defeated with [[sonic weapon]]ry, but the symbiote lives on because it is merged with Kasady's [[blood]]stream.

===Maximum Carnage===
Carnage goes on to recruit an army of [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] supervillains including [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] to overtake [[New York City]]. They are driven back by Spider-Man, Venom, and a number of other superheroes.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1-2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101-103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378-380; ''Spider-Man'' #35-37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201-203</ref> The Carnage symbiote was supposedly destroyed in the conflict, and Kasady was sent back to Ryker's Island, where he unexpectedly transformed during transfer and rampaged through the prison. Shriek, who was still in league with Carnage, aided Carnage in taking over the island and recruiting villains like the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Mysterio]], [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]], and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. In the end, Carnage was thwarted once again by Spider-Man.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

Venom eventually reabsorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good." Without the symbiote, Kasady retains the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees, but does so as a normal human, only for Spider-Man to easily defeat him in a fight. Kasady finds a replica of the Carnage symbiote in the [[Negative Zone]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

===Death===
In ''New Avengers'' #2, Carnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1-2</ref> [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] finishes him off, flying Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] and ripping him apart. According to [[Iron Man]]'s computer, Kasady may not have been inside the symbiote when the Sentry ripped it apart.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #8</ref> However, it is later discovered that while Kasady did in fact die in the incident, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth. The Doppelganger and Shriek return, hoping to repair the symbiote.<ref>''Carnage'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)}}

The alien symbiote endows Cletus Kasady with enhanced physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] combined<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #362</ref> and shapeshifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]].<ref>''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' one-shot</ref> Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has his own twisted version of Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]], as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to "see" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats. He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. He is able to rapidly regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human. It isn't known, however, if he can fully regenerate severed limbs or missing internal organs. Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound, and is undetectable to Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]]. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of weapons such as spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #360</ref> Though  not originally seen, the Carnage symbiote has become [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by mere touch.<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #2</ref>

==Character==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2010}}
Carnage is a [[psychopath]] and justifies his acts of murder with an [[Absurdism|absurdist]] philosophy, based on the idea that the [[universe]] is essentially [[chaos|chaotic]] and that [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] are a perversion. He believes that even the average person can be like him, provided he has "guts". According to Kasady, all human beings are basically [[evil]]; most just won't admit it. His ultimate goal is for a society based on [[murder]]ous [[hedonism]] and [[nihilism]], with no law or [[Morality|moral]] order, and for people to have the freedom to do whatever they want.<ref>"''Savage Alliance!''" ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #362 (May 1992):{{quote|I mean, order's just a lie, right? Built on fantasies... like law, an' morals!  I remember when I first realized that! How without those illusions, I could do anything!  Up to an' includin' murder! Man, I never felt so free! An' once I help the rest o' this planet catch on... oh wow. Blood an' glory!|Carnage}}''</ref> Carnage seems to have little interest in such typical supervillain desires as wealth and [[Hegemony|world domination]]. He kills mainly for his own pleasure, but also sees it as a form of "art". Kasady takes pride when his actions gain media attention, saying "I'm not inspired by the media... I inspire the media."<ref>''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' (1996)</ref> He once told [[Demogoblin]], in response to the demon's assertion that the universe is made of patterns and plans, that "Life is '''meaningless!''' '''Chaos!''' The universe has '''no center!''' Its creator is a drooling '''idiot!'''"<ref>''Spectacular Spideman'' #201</ref>

[[Image:Spider-carnage-1-.png|200px|right|thumb|Ben Reilly as Spider-Carnage.<br>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #410.<br>Cover art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]
Aside from Cletus Kasady, the Carnage symbiote bonds with [[Ben Reilly]], creating '''[[Spider-Carnage]]''',<ref>''Web of Carnage''</ref> and later the [[Silver Surfer]] to become '''Cosmic Carnage'''.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430 (January 1998)</ref>

===Exiles===
The Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the "'''Spider'''", and becomes a member of [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref>''Exiles'' #12</ref>

===Intercompany crossover===
Carnage teams up with and later turns against the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] during ''Spider-Man And Batman'' #1, the two's mutual psychosis leading them into a brief alliance before their differing methods of murder cause a clash, Carnage favouring numbers in his murder sprees while the Joker prefers the artistry of his usual traps and tricks. Carnage is defeated by [[Batman]] in the subsequent fight when he loses control of his symbiote while panicking after the Joker threatens to set off a bomb to destroy [[Gotham City|Gotham]] - himself and Carnage included - rather than see Carnage kill Batman, Batman reflecting that many serial killers kill so many to try and escape death themselves by 'appeasing' the Grim Reaper with their own sacrifices.<ref>''Spider-Man and Batman'' #1</ref>

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage bonds with [[Spider-Girl]]'s friend, Moose Mansfied.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl's little brother, [[Benjamin Richard Parker|Ben]], turning him into a miniature version of himself.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #11</ref> Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #12</ref>

In a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create "Biopreds", living weapons that the government use to try and stop '''Mayhem''', Spider-Girl's part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and it's defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred<ref>''Spider-Girl: The End''</ref>

===Spider-Man Unlimited===
The ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' version of Carnage has the additional power to "see" from any part of itself and relay the visual information to Kasady.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref>

===Ultimate Carnage===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] series, Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism based on the symbiotic suit research of [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Richard Parker|Richard Parker]], created by [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Conners]] and consists of his own DNA and that of Peter Parker, which at the time contained samples of the Venom symbiote. When Carnage was first introduced, he was a monster of instinct, with no intelligence or self awareness, with his only aim to feed on the DNA of others to stabilize himself. After killing [[Gwen Stacey#Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy]], this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her "essence" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy. Ultimate Carnage's appearance is based on Venom, Peter Parker, Curt Conners,  and Gwen Stacy. In its monster form, Carnage resembles his original incarnation, such as its large eyes and fangs, as well as the Lizard's claws. In addition, the center of its body glows yellow, although after assuming the form of Gwen Stacy, Carnage loses this glow in its monster form. In its 'human form', Carnage resembles Peter's father Richard Parker in its first appearance, and Gwen in its second. The Carnage symbiote was absorbed by [[Alternate versions of Venom#Ultimate Spider-Man|Eddie Brock]], leaving Gwen and returning her to a healthy duplicate of the original.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128</ref><ref>[http://uk.comics.ign.com/dor/objects/739976/ultimate-spider-man/images/ultimate-spider-man-20081016061615870.html?page=mediaFull ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127]</ref> In one ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comic book, Cletus Kasady is seen on a list of known cat burglars.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53</ref>

===Television===
[[Image:Carnage.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Carnage in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Carnage appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]]. Due to being a [[Saturday morning cartoon]], Carnage is depicted as a madman rather than a serial killer, and is never shown actually killing anyone. Cletus Kasady first appeared in the third season episode "Sins of Fathers" where he is captured by the police in his home after planning to explode a bomb over New York. In prison he shared a cell with Eddie Brock (who had recently lost the symbiote) who finds Cletus very frustrating. In the episode "Venom Returns" the symbiote finds Eddie in prison and rebonds with him and escapes; Cletus then becomes jealous of Eddie's powers as he sees Venom flee the prison, saying he wants the power for himself. [[Baron Mordo]], servant of the demon [[Dormammu]], appears in front of Cletus with the Carnage symbiote and explains that it has the same power as Venom. He makes a deal with Cletus to have the symbiote power in exchange for serving Dormammu; Cletus accepts the offer and bonds with the symbiote, turning into Carnage, and then escapes the prison. Carnage and Venom team up with each other and steal the portal device so Dormammu can travel to earth and consume souls. In the next episode, "Carnage", after Venom betrays Dormammu, Carnage is offered the ability to absorb the [[wikt:life force|life force]] out of people so Dormammu can have enough energy to escape his dimension. Carnage accepts, eager to witness the destruction Dormammu would wreck on the world. Carnage also kidnaps Eddie's girlfriend Ashley. Spider-Man calls for Iron Man's help in order to stop Carnage and send Dormammu back to his own reality. Venom also joins forces with Spider-Man to help save Ashley. A final showdown results in a fight between Spider-Man, Carnage, Dormammu, Iron Man and Venom in an underground cave where Carnage has released Dormammu. Iron Man discovers Carnage must be sent into the portal as well in order for it to close. As Carnage is sucked into the portal, he grabs Ashley saying that he will not leave unless someone goes with him. Venom then pounces on Carnage, releasing Ashley as Carnage and Venom are sucked into the portal as it closes. In the series finale, the Carnage symbiote is seen arriving on an alternate Earth through a portal, merging with that reality's Spider-Man who possesses Cletus Kassady's psychopathic personality- although evidence suggested that the Spider-Man it merged with may have been a clone- and driving him insane. The resulting 'Spider-Carnage' begins developing a weapon that can destroy all reality out of his anger at the torment he has suffered since acquiring his powers, his plans only being thwarted by a team of alternate Spider-Men assembled by the [[Beyonder]] and [[Madame Web]]. The "original" Spider-Man follows Spider-Carnage to yet another alternate dimension, but being no match for the symbiote in a fight, instead locates [[Uncle Ben]], who in this reality is still alive. Ben convinces the alternate Peter Parker to try and separate from the Carnage symbiote, but the bond is too strong, and he ultimately commits suicide by leaping into a blank dimension, thus saving all of reality.

* Carnage appears semi-regularly in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' voiced by [[Michael Donovan]].<ref>[http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html TV.com:] Michael Donovan Credits</ref>

* Cletus Kasady makes a non-speaking [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' episode "Reinforcement." He is shown as a patient wearing a [[Santa Claus]] hat in Ravencroft, during a [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]] session with [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] when [[Kraven the Hunter]] attacks to break out the two villains.

===Video games===
* Carnage is a [[boss (video games)|boss character]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'' and its sequel ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]''.
* Carnage is a boss in the 2000 ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. He assists [[Doctor Octopus]] in a plot to establish a symbiote invasion. After Spider-Man defeats Carnage, the symbiote attaches itself to Doctor Octopus turning him into the Monster-Ock. It destroys much of the underwater base when chasing Spider-Man. When the base exploded, the symbiote had protected Doctor Octopus from harm. The Carnage symbiote then detaches itself from Doctor Octopus and heads back into the underwater base, presumably to rebond with Cletus Kasady. In this game he is given teeth rather than jagged lips.
* Carnage appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game. This version is Peter Parker who was injected with micro-symbiotes by [[Vulture (comics)|Adrian Toomes]]. It breaks free and fights Venom. After being defeated, Venom absorbs the Carnage symbiote into himself, giving him complete control over the suit.
* Carnage is a playable character in the PSP version of ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. At the end of the game, [[Nick Fury]] dubs the research of the meteor shards "Project: Carnage."
* Carnage is a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced again by Fred Tatasciore. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} He is only available for download, and is the first downloadable content character outside of the six characters to be featured in an updated version for the PS3 and Xbox.<ref>[http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/14233938/marvel-ultimate-alliance-2/videos/mua2_trl_carnagevignette_100809.html;jsessionid=37u21mq716o89 Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 Xbox 360 Trailer - Carnage Vignette]</ref> The DLC pack was at first removed but recently became available once more until December 2010.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The DLC also includes an extra mission where the player fights Carnage after fighting several other bosses from the game.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Carnage has been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and brought to the Triskelion as well as a fragment from the Tablet of Order and Chaos. S.H.I.E.L.D. was doing experiments on both and foolishly put Carnage and the fragment together to study the resulting combination. With the power of the fragment, Carnage gains the power to reanimate those he drained the life from as mindless zombies, which eventually mutate into creatures like himself. Spider-Man pursues Carnage throughout the burning ruins of the Triskelion and eventually defeats him with the help of a small amount of reprogrammed [[Spider-Slayer]]s armed with flamethrowers and retrieves the final fragment, leaving the creature pinned under rubble. In-game, it is stated that the name "Carnage" was given to him by the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

===Attractions===
The [[Universal Orlando Resort]]'s [[Halloween Horror Nights#XII: Islands of Fear (2002)|2002 Halloween Horror Nights]] featured a haunted maze entitled "Maximum Carnage". The maze was designed to be a trip through Carnage's hideout and contained all his henchmen and the remains of various superheroes. The house was located in "Island under Siege", formerly Marvel's superhero island. Carnage also was the icon chosen to represent that specific island for the event. The event's main icon, "The Caretaker," chose him based on his disregard for life and desire to see total chaos.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20021001073503/themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html Hallowen Horror Nights]</ref><ref>[http://www.hhnvault.com/haunts/hhn12_houses.htm Open the Vault.
