'''Carnage''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Writer [[David Michelinie]] created Carnage to be a darker version of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]<ref>''Spider-Man: Carnage''</ref> intending to have Venom's human alter ego, [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Eddie Brock]], be killed off in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom's popularity grew, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character; a total psychopath who unlike Venom had no sense of honor. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"<ref> ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45 </ref> and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage."  Carnage's human component, '''Cletus Kasady''' was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]] who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774|title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread)|accessdate=2007-06-24|author=Erik Larsen|date=2007-03-27|publisher=Image Comics Community}}</ref> [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote. 

Cletus Kasady was introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344 and first appears as Carnage in issue #360. He is the main villain in the 1993  "''[[Maximum Carnage]]''" crossover a 14-part storyline crossover that spanned through all the ''Spider-Man'' titles. While highly popular, some fans contend that the storyline dragged on for too long and was nothing but a complete gore-fest with little value story-wise.<ref>[http://www.spideykicksbutt.com/Top10s/10WorstSpideyStories.html 10 Worst Spider-man Stories]</ref>

In 1996, two one-shot comics centered entirely around Carnage were released, entitled ''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' and ''Carnage: It's A Wonderful Life'', both of which expand on his character.

==Fictional character biography==
Cletus Kasady has a troubled childhood, killing his grandmother by pushing her down a flight of stairs, and [[cruelty to animals|torturing]] his mother's dog who afterwards tries to kill him and is apparently beaten to death by his father, who receives no defense from Kasady during his trial. As an [[orphan]], Kasady is sent to the St. Estes Home for Boys, where his [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] behavior makes him the target of abuse from both the other orphans and the staff. Kasady vindicates himself by murdering the disciplinarian administrator and burning down the orphanage.

Kasady becomes a [[serial killer]]. He is captured and sent to [[Ryker's Island]] prison where he shares a [[prison cell|cell]] with [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Eddie Brock]], who had lost his [[Symbiote (comics)|alien symbiote]]. Brock's symbiote soon returns and bonds with him again, and unwittingly leaves behind the symbiote's offspring (The symbiotes reproduce asexually, once per generation. The children are then of no consequence to the parent. Thusly, the Venom symbiote felt no need to inform Brock of the existence of the new symbiote.) which gets into a cut and bonds with Kasady's bloodstream, transforming him into Carnage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344-345</ref>  He escapes prison,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #359</ref> and begins a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, writes "Carnage Rules" on the walls with his own blood. He is found by [[Spider-Man]], though the hero proves to be no match for Carnage's powers. In desperation, Spider-Man makes a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #360-363</ref> Carnage is defeated with [[sonic weaponry]], but the symbiote lives on because he is merged with Kasady's [[blood]]stream.

Carnage goes on to recruit an army of [[psychosis|psychotic]] supervillains including [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] to overtake [[New York City]]. They are driven back by Spider-Man, Venom, and number of other superheroes.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1-2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101-103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378-380; ''Spider-Man'' #35-37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201-203</ref> 

Aside from Cletus Kasady, the Carnage symbiote bonds with [[Ben Reilly]]<ref>''Web of Carnage'' </ref> and later the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430 (January 1998)</ref>

Venom eventually re-absorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good." Without the symbiote, Kasady retains the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees, but does so as a normal human, only for Spider-Man to easily defeat him in a fight. Kasady finds a replica of the Carnage symbiote in the [[Negative Zone]]. 

The Carnage symbiote later [[asexual reproduction|spawns]] a "child" symbiote, named [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]].<ref>''Venom vs. Carnage'' (2004)</ref>

Carnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1-2</ref> [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] finishes him off, flying Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] and ripping him apart. According to [[Iron Man]]'s computer, Kasady may not have been inside the symbiote when the Sentry ripped it apart.<ref>Mighty Avengers #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{main|Symbiote (comics)}}

The alien symbiote endows Cletus Kasady with enhanced physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]] combined.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #362</ref> and shape-shifting abilities; project a web-like substance from any part of his body including form a variety of weapons; and plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]]. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to intense sounds and heat, and is undetectable to Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]]. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of weapons such as spears, knives, axes, etc.{{issue}} Venom's costume cannot replenish itself and is a definite mass while Carnage is constantly forming new molecules.{{issue}} Carnage's symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by mere touch,<ref>''[[New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]]'' #2</ref> and also has the power to "see" from any part of itself and relay the visual information to Kasady.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref> During the 'Maximum Carnage' storyline, Carnage reveals that his symbiote has developed an immunity to sonic attacks. It still retains a vulnerability to heat.{{issue}}

==Character==
Carnage justifies his acts of murder with an [[Absurdism|absurdist]] philosophy, based on the idea that the [[universe]] is essentially [[chaos|chaotic]] and that [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] are a perversion. He believes that even the average person can be like him, provided he has "guts". According to Kasady, all human beings are basically [[evil]]; most just won't admit it. His ultimate goal is for a society based on [[murder]]ous [[hedonism]] and [[nihilism]], with no law or [[Morality|moral]] order, and for people to have the freedom to do whatever they want.<ref>{{quotation|I mean, order's just a lie, right? Built on fantasies... like law, an' morals!  I remember when I first realized that! How without those illusions, I could do anything!  Up to an' includin' murder! Man, I never felt so free! An' once I help the rest o' this planet catch on... oh wow. Blood an' glory!|Carnage}}''"''Savage Alliance!''" ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #362 (May 1992)</ref> Carnage seems to have little interest in such typical supervillain desires as wealth and [[world domination]]. He kills mainly for his own pleasure, but also sees it as form of "art". Kasady takes pride when his actions gain media attention, saying "I'm not inspired by the media... I inspire the media."<ref>''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' (1996)</ref> He once told [[Demogoblin]], in response to the demon's assertion that the universe is part of an [[intelligent design]], that "Life is '''meaningless!''' '''Chaos!''' The universe has '''no center!''' Its creator is a drooling '''idiot!'''"<ref>''Spectacular Spideman'' #201</ref>
Like Venom, Carnage has threatened to devour some of his victims, such as threatening to tear Spider-Man's arms off and eat them in the novel ''Carnage in New York''.<ref> "I'm going to tear your arms off and eat them, Spider-Man." -Carnage ''Carnage in New York'' - David Michelinie and Dean Wesley Smith</ref>

===MC2===

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] series, Carnage is self-regenerating form of life based on the symbiotic suit research of [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Richard Parker|Richard Parker]], created by [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Conners]] and consists of his own DNA and that of Peter Parker. When Carnage was first introduced, he was a monster of instinct, with no intelligence or self awareness, with his only aim to devour the DNA of others to sustain himself. After "devouring" ultimate Gwen Stacey, this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her "essence" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacey. Ultimate Carnage's appearance is based on Venom, Peter Parker, Curt Conners and Gwen Stacey. In its monster form, Carnage copies Venom's general appearance, such as its large eyes and fangs, as well as the Lizard's claws. In its 'human form', Carnage resembles Peter in its first appearance, and Gwen in its second. The Carnage symbiote was absorbed by [[Venom (comics)#Ultimate Venom|Eddie Brock]], leaving Gwen and returning her to an healthy duplicate of the original.<ref>Ultimate Spider-man 128</ref><ref>http://uk.comics.ign.com/dor/objects/739976/ultimate-spider-man/images/ultimate-spider-man-20081016061615870.html?page=mediaFull</ref>
