'''Carnage''' ('''Cletus Kasady''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #344 (March 1991), and was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]].

==Publication history==
Writer [[David Michelinie]] created Carnage to be a darker version of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]<ref>''Spider-Man: Carnage''</ref> intending to have Venom's human alter ego, [[Eddie Brock]], be killed off in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom's popularity increased, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character; a total psychopath who unlike Venom had no sense of honor. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"<ref> ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45 </ref> and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage."  Carnage's human component, Cletus Kasady was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]] who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774|title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread)|accessdate=2007-06-24|author=Erik Larsen|date=2007-03-27|publisher=Image Comics Community}}</ref> [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote. 

Cletus Kasady was introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344 and first appears as Carnage in issue #360. He is the main villain in the 1993  "''[[Maximum Carnage]]''" crossover, a 14-part storyline crossover that spanned through all the ''Spider-Man'' titles. In 1996, two one-shot comics centered entirely around Carnage were released, entitled ''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' and ''Carnage: It's A Wonderful Life'', both of which expand on his character.

==Fictional character biography==
Cletus Kasady has a troubled childhood, killing his grandmother by pushing her down a flight of stairs, and [[cruelty to animals|torturing]] his mother's dog who afterwards tries to kill him and is apparently beaten to the brink of death by his father, who receives no defense from Kasady during his trial. As an [[orphan]], Kasady is sent to the St. Estes Home for Boys, where his [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] behavior makes him the target of abuse from both the other orphans and the staff. Kasady gains revenge by murdering the disciplinarian administrator, pushing a girl, who refused a date with him, in front of a moving bus, and burning down the orphanage.

Kasady becomes a [[serial killer]]. He is captured and sent to [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ryker's Island|Ryker's Island]] prison where he shares a [[prison cell|cell]] with [[Eddie Brock]], who had lost the [[Symbiote (comics)|alien symbiote]] that transformed him into the supervillain [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. Brock's symbiote soon returns and bonds with him again, and unwittingly leaves behind the symbiote's offspring; the symbiotes reproduce asexually, once per generation; the children are then of no consequence to the parent, hence Brock's symbiote felt no need to inform Brock of the existence of its offspring. The new symbiote enters Kasady's bloodstream through a cut and bonds with his blood, transforming him into Carnage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344-345</ref>  He escapes prison,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #359</ref> and begins a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, writes "Carnage Rules" on the walls with his own blood. He is found by [[Spider-Man]], though the hero proves to be no match for Carnage's powers. In desperation, Spider-Man makes a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #360-363</ref> Carnage is defeated with [[sonic weapon]]ry, but the symbiote lives on because it is merged with Kasady's [[blood]]stream.

Carnage goes on to recruit an army of [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] supervillains including [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] to overtake [[New York City]]. They are driven back by Spider-Man, Venom, and a number of other superheroes.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1-2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101-103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378-380; ''Spider-Man'' #35-37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201-203</ref> 

Aside from Cletus Kasady, the Carnage symbiote bonds with [[Ben Reilly]], creating Spider-Carnage,<ref>''Web of Carnage'' </ref> and later the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430 (January 1998)</ref>

Venom eventually reabsorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good." Without the symbiote, Kasady retains the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees, but does so as a normal human, only for Spider-Man to easily defeat him in a fight. Kasady finds a replica of the Carnage symbiote in the [[Negative Zone]]. 

The Carnage symbiote later [[asexual reproduction|spawns]] a "child" symbiote, named [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]].<ref>''Venom vs. Carnage'' (2004)</ref>

Carnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].<ref>''[[New Avengers]]'' #1-2</ref> [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] finishes him off, flying Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] and ripping him apart. According to [[Iron Man]]'s computer, Kasady may not have been inside the symbiote when the Sentry ripped it apart.<ref>Mighty Avengers #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)}}

The alien symbiote endows Cletus Kasady with enhanced physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] combined<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #362</ref> and shapeshifting abilities, project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of a variety of weapons, and plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]]. Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface. He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. He is able to rapidly regenerate damaged bodily tissues much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human. It isn't known, however, if he can fully regenerate severed limbs or missing internal organs. Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. For instance, Kasady's body itself is riddled with cancer, yet the presence of the symbiote negates any effects the cancer would normally have. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to intense sounds and heat, and is undetectable to Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]]. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of weapons such as spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #360</ref> Though  not originally seen, the Carnage symbiote has become [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by mere touch.<ref>''[[New Avengers]]'' #2</ref> It also has the power to "see" from any part of itself and relay the visual information to Kasady.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref>

==Character==
Carnage justifies his acts of murder with an [[Absurdism|absurdist]] philosophy, based on the idea that the [[universe]] is essentially [[chaos|chaotic]] and that [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] are a perversion. He believes that even the average person can be like him, provided he has "guts". According to Kasady, all human beings are basically [[evil]]; most just won't admit it. His ultimate goal is for a society based on [[murder]]ous [[hedonism]] and [[nihilism]], with no law or [[Morality|moral]] order, and for people to have the freedom to do whatever they want.<ref>"''Savage Alliance!''" ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #362 (May 1992):{{quote|I mean, order's just a lie, right? Built on fantasies... like law, an' morals!  I remember when I first realized that! How without those illusions, I could do anything!  Up to an' includin' murder! Man, I never felt so free! An' once I help the rest o' this planet catch on... oh wow. Blood an' glory!|Carnage}}''</ref> Carnage seems to have little interest in such typical supervillain desires as wealth and [[Hegemony|world domination]]. He kills mainly for his own pleasure, but also sees it as a form of "art". Kasady takes pride when his actions gain media attention, saying "I'm not inspired by the media... I inspire the media."<ref>''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' (1996)</ref> He once told [[Demogoblin]], in response to the demon's assertion that the universe is made of patterns and plans, that "Life is '''meaningless!''' '''Chaos!''' The universe has '''no center!''' Its creator is a drooling '''idiot!'''"<ref>''Spectacular Spideman'' #201</ref>

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
The Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the "Spider", and becomes a member of [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref> ''Exiles'' #12 </ref>

===Intercompany crossover===
Carnage teams up with and later turns against the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] during ''Spider-Man And Batman'' #1.

===MC2===
In [[MC2|this]] future timeline, Carnage bonds with [[Spider-Girl]]'s friend, Moose Mansfied.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl's little brother, [[Benjamin Richard Parker|Ben]], turning him into a miniature version of himself.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #11</ref> Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #12</ref>

===Ultimate Carnage===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] series, Carnage is a self-regenerating form of life based on the symbiotic suit research of [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Richard Parker|Richard Parker]], created by [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Lizard|Curt Conners]] and consists of his own DNA and that of Peter Parker, which at the time contained samples of the Venom symbiote. When Carnage was first introduced, he was a monster of instinct, with no intelligence or self awareness, with his only aim to leech the blood of others to sustain himself. After killing [[Gwen Stacey#Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy]], this incarnation of Carnage has gone on to mimic her "essence" and now believes itself to be Gwen Stacy. Ultimate Carnage's appearance is based on Venom, Peter Parker, Curt Conners,  and Gwen Stacy. In its monster form, Carnage resembles his original incarnation, such as its large eyes and fangs, as well as the Lizard's claws. In its 'human form', Carnage resembles Peter's father Richard Parker in its first appearance, and Gwen in its second. The Carnage symbiote was absorbed by [[Eddie Brock#Alternate versions|Eddie Brock]], leaving Gwen and returning her to a healthy duplicate of the original.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128</ref><ref>[http://uk.comics.ign.com/dor/objects/739976/ultimate-spider-man/images/ultimate-spider-man-20081016061615870.html?page=mediaFull ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127]</ref> In one ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comic book, Cletus Kasady is seen on a list of known cat burglars.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53 </ref>
