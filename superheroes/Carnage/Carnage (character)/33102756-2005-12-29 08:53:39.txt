'''Carnage''' (Cletus Kasady) is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by comicbook writer [[David Michelinie]].

Cletus Kasady first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 1 #344. As Carnage, he made a [[cameo role|cameo]] in #360 before making his first full apearance in #361.

==Character History==

Carnage was once a [[serial killer]] known as Cletus Kasady, and became Carnage after merging with the offspring of the [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[symbiote]] called [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] during a prison breakout at which Eddie Brock/Venom and Kasady were both present. The symbiote not only made Kasady more dangerous physically, it amplified his psychotic nature making him even less mentally stable than he had been previously, and therefore even more dangerous to innocent people.  An interesting note is that, unlike Venom, Carnage considers himself to be a singular entity, referring to himself as "I" instead of "We," despite the fact that Kasady and the symbiote can be considered separate entities. [[Spider-Man]] has at one point hypothesized that this is because the Carnage symbiote is more strongly bonded to Kasady than the Venom symbiote is to Brock, but it could also be a result of Kasady's self-serving personality.  Carnage is also the "father" of [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]. A note on his childhood, Cletus believes that he killed his father, who apparently killed the boy's mother when she tried to attack him, though he is a bit unclear on the exact details. He also revealed that he killed his grandmother when he was younger, pushing her down a flight of stairs.

Kasady has been separated and re-attached to the symbiote multiple times.  The Carnage symbiote has occasionally attached itself to other hosts, including [[The Silver Surfer]] and the [[Ben Reilly]] version of Spider-Man.  At one point the Silver Surfer encapsulated the symbiote in space, during which Kasady retained the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees (albeit as a powerless human). After the symbiote was freed and once again rebonded to Kasady, Venom decided to absorb the Carnage symbiote "for good."  This was short lived, however, as Kasady coincidentally found an exact replica of the symbiote in the [[Negative Zone]].

===Maximum Carnage===
[[Image:Web103.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Carnage battles Spider-Man and Venom. Cover to ''Web of Spider-Man'' #103.Alex Saviuk, artist.]]

The most famous storyline in which he appears is ''Maximum Carnage'' in which Venom and Spider-Man had to team up to stop Carnage. Although Spider-Man has successfully thwarted Venom a number of times, Venom is technically more powerful than Spider-Man and has used this advantage to win an upper hand on occasion. Carnage, however, is actually more powerful than Venom, and it took both him and Spider-Man to stop Carnage during the "Maximum Carnage" series.

During Maximum Carnage it is revealed that the Symbiote has become a part of Kasady's blood and is unremovable from him, Kasady only needed to be cut for the symbiote to flood out to become Carnage once again(though recent stories have retconned this ability). Unlike Venom, Carnage had become less vulnerable to the high pitch sounds which would normally stop Venom, however he was still vulnerable to intense heat.

===Death?===
[[Image:Sentrycarnage.jpg|right|255px|thumb|Art from ''New Avengers'' #2. Drawn by [[David Finch]].]]

Recently, in the pages of ''New Avengers'', Carnage was one of many supervillains trying to escape from The Raft. The [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]] flew Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere, where he then ripped Carnage apart.

Oddly enough, when the Sentry ripped Carnage apart, there did not seem to be a human inside, but simply the symbiote. Given that characters earlier in the story referred to Carnage possessing traits only possessed by the hostless "Ultimate" version, some fans have suggested that perhaps [[Brian Michael Bendis]], the story's writer, got the two confused and directed the artist accordingly. However, it should be noted that during Maximum Carnage, Carnage was able to fake his death by creating a decoy of himself made out of symbiote tissue.  

There is the possibility that the guards at the vault separated Carnage and Kasady and put them in different places

It is therefore possible that, as when the symbiote briefly abandoned Kasady for [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], [[Ben Reilly]] and the [[Silver Surfer]], it had taken another host at the time, and thus Kasady survives on Earth, while the symbiote may be capable of surviving in orbit.

However, there was no indication in the comic books as to the possibility of Carnage's survival and no reference to his death in later issues of the storyline.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Spiderman037.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Cover to Spider-Man #37. Carnage using his costume as a blade.]]

The alien symbiote suit is made of tough, flexible fibers of organic polymers which have the ability to mimic any type of clothing whatsoever and provide the wearer with nearly limitless pocket-storage. It also has a limited capability to change the wearer's appearance and it dampens Spider-Man's "spider-sense", making Carnage (as well as Venom) nearly undetectable to Spider-Man until they are in his direct sight. Similarly, Venom's ability to "detect" Kasady's presence is hindered by the suit's abilities.

In addition to the above abilities, the suit gives Carnage the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet, a power which the symbiote adopted from its first victim/user, Spider-Man. Also adopted from Spider-Man is the ability to project a web-like substance from the body. However in the form of Carnage, the web substance can be projected from any part of the costume/body, not just the hands/wrists. Kasady can also separate parts of the symbiote costume from himself and use them as weapons, but they dissipate after a very short time, again similar to the artificial webbing Spider-Man uses, which dissolves after a period of time. Carnage's symbiote originally had the power to "see" from any part of itself and relay the visual information to Kasady. However, when the symbiote mutated and gained new powers during ''Maximum Carnage'' this ability was lost.

The living costume has endowed Carnage with superhuman physical strength sufficient to lift roughly 50 tons.  Carnage also possesses levels of superhuman agility and reaction time comparable to that of Spider-Man.

Aside from this, as an inmate in various prisons and mental asylums, Kasady had to be a formidable hand-to-hand combatant just to survive. When that talent is combined with the alien symbiote, Kasady becomes one of the most lethal of all Marvel [[supervillains]].

==Ultimate Carnage==

The [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] version of Carnage is almost completely unlike the [[Marvel Universe]] version, although coincidentally both incarnations were first drawn by [[Mark Bagley]].

[[Lizard (comics)|"Ultimate" Curt Connors]] created a rejuvenating organism using his [[DNA]], Peter's DNA, and work stolen from Peter's late father, who was an expert in cellular reconstruction, and involved in the creation of [[Venom (comics)|"Ultimate" Venom]]. The creature possessed its own shape-shifting ability, capable to alter its shape and proportions.  The creature escaped and started to absorb other people's vitality, and their DNA, to survive, leaving the victims dead. The victims also assume a mummified form.  One of the victims is [[Gwen Stacy#Gwen Stacy in Ultimate Marvel|"Ultimate" Gwen Stacy]].

Unlike the original Carnage, the Ultimate version does not bond with anyone. Also, despite the title of the arc being "Carnage", the creature is not called Carnage in the story. In addition, while the original Carnage is a homicidal maniac, the Ultimate one is a mindless creature that kills to sustain itself.

In the Ultimate Spider-Man Video Game, another Carnage is formed when the small amount of Venom that was not removed from Spider-Man takes over his body with the help of a serum made by Trask Industries. This Carnage is later absorbed by Venom, whose host then gains full control of the Venom suit.

==Carnage in other media==
===Carnage in Television===
[[Image:carng1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carnage in [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]].]]

In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Carnage worked for the evil [[demon]] [[Dormammu]] and was sent out to capture enough "life energy" from human beings to provide Dormammu the strength to enter our world.  This version of Carnage was much tamer and less violent than his appearances in the comics, most likely because a serial killer murdering people does not often appear on Saturday morning cartoon shows. He was eventually defeated by Spider-Man and Venom, sending the symbiote and Dormammu hurling through a dimensional vortex.

In the series finale of the show, it is revealed that the Carnage symbiote was sent to another reality where it bonded with an extremely emotionally unstable Peter Parker. The joining of the two created the insane Spider-Carnage, who was threatening to destroy all reality and thus all existence. The real Peter Parker, assisted by several other Spider-Men from other universes, were able to convince Spider-Carnage to fight the symbiote off. This was done by bringing in Peter's [[Uncle Ben]] from a reality where he was not murdered. Spider-Carnage saw the error of his ways, but could not reject the symbiote, and cast himself into a dimensional vortex, destroying himself.

Carnage has also appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]''.

===Carnage in video games===
In the [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', as in the comics, Carnage seems to be sane enough to actually enlist aid from other Spider-Man villains, [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]], the [[Demogoblin]], and [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]].  The game allowed the player to control Spider-Man and/or Venom in multiple levels ranging from fighting punks on the streets of [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]] to battling security droids in the [[Fantastic Four]] headquarters.  It also featured the ability to summon various Marvel heroes (such as [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]) to aid the player by appearing to perform one or two special attacks.

In the [[video game]] [[Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety]], Spider-man and Venom team up to fight the Jury and other symbiotes, and eventually Carnage at the end. Carnage also appeared as a boss in Spider-man & X-Men: Arcade's Revenge; however, he turned out to be merely an android created by Arcade. Carnage also appeared in Spider-Man for Sony Playstation, Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Color.  He was also the final boss in the Japanese-only game [[Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]].

In the video game Ultimate Spiderman he made a small apperance as a boss for venom. Here Carnage was Peter Parker who was given a injection similar to the Venom suit. Venom chased Carnage through a labratory and after fighting throughout the entire lab Venom "fed" on Carnage. Afterwards Venom reached into his body and threw out Carnage who had turned back into Peter Parker.(since Venom had absorbed the ingection)
