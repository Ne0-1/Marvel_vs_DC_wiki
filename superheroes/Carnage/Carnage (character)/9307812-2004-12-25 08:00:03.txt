'''Carnage''' is the name of a [[supervillain]] in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was once a [[serial killer]] known as Cletus Kassidy, and became Carnage after merging with the offspring of the [[alien]] [[symbiote]] called [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] during a prison riot at which Eddie Brock/Venom and Kassidy were both present. The symbiote not only made Kassidy more dangerous physically, it amplified his psychotic nature making him even less mentally stable than he had been previously, making him even more dangerous to innocent people.

The alien symbiote suit is made of tough, flexible fibers of organic polymers which have the ability to mimic any type of clothing whatsoever and provide the wearer with nearly limitless pocket-storage. It also has a limited capability to change the wearer's appearance and it dampens Spider-Man's "spider-sense", making Carnage (as well as Venom) nearly undetectable to Spider-Man until they are in his direct sight. Similarly, Venom's ability to "detect" Kassidy's presence is hindered by the suit's abilities.

In addition to the above abilities, the suit gives Carnage the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet, a power which the symbiote adopted from it's first victim/user, Spider-Man. Also adopted from Spider-Man is the ability to project a web-like substance from the body. However in the form of Carnage, the web substance can be projected from any part of the costume/body, not just the hands/wrists. Kassidy can also separate parts of the symbiote costume from himself and use them as weapons, but they dissipate after a very short time, again similar to the artificial webbing Spider-Man uses, which dissolves after a period of time.

The most famous storyline in which he appears is ''Maximum Carnage'' in which Venom and Spider-Man had to team up to stop Carnage. Although Spider-Man has succesfully thwarted Venom a number of times, Venom is technically more powerful than Spider-Man and has used this advantage to win an upper hand on occasion. Carnage, however, is actually more powerful than Venom, and it took both he and Spider-Man to stop Carnage during the "Maximum Carnage" series.

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Carnage has a somewhat different origin (combining the origin of Ultimate Venom with elements of the [[Scarlet Spider]]), and murders [[Gwen Stacy]].
