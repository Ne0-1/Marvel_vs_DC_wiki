'''Carnage''' ('''Cletus Kasady''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. The character first appeared as Cletus Kasady in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #344 (March 1991) and as Carnage in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #360.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #360">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_1_360|title=Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 360|work=Marvel Wiki}}</ref> Carnage was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artists [[Erik Larsen]] and [[Mark Bagley]], based on elements of the precursor character [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. Along with Venom, the character belongs to a race of [[Amorphous creature|amorphous]] [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]. In 2009, Carnage was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|title=Carnage is number 90|work=Comics|publisher=[[IGN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715065142/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|archivedate=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Writer [[David Michelinie]] created Carnage to be a darker version of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]],<ref name="SM: Carnage">''Spider-Man: Carnage''</ref> intending to have Venom's human alter ego, [[Eddie Brock]], be killed off in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom's popularity increased, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character: a total psychopath who, unlike Venom, had no sense of morality. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"<ref name="Wizard">''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45</ref> and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage". Carnage's human component, Cletus Kasady, was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]], who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]].<ref name="Cletus Kasady question">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread) |accessdate=2007-06-24 |author=Erik Larsen |date=2007-03-27 |publisher=Image Comics Community |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210624/http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref> [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote.

In 1996, two one-shot comics centered entirely around Carnage were released, entitled ''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' and ''Carnage: It's A Wonderful Life'', both of which expand on his character.

After a 2004 appearance in ''[[List of New Avengers story arcs#Breakout (Issues #1-6)|New Avengers]]'' the character was presumed dead and was absent from comics for nearly six years. A 2010-2011 [[limited series]] titled ''Carnage'' featured the return of the symbiote, where it temporarily found a new female host before reuniting with Kasady.<ref name="Carnage Female Host">{{cite web|last=George|first=Richard|title=SDCC 10: The Return of Carnage|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/07/25/sdcc-10-the-return-of-carnage|publisher=IGN}}</ref> The comic was released as a tie-in to the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/25/spider-man-big-time/|title=Spider-Man: Big Time Begins, 'Spider-Girl,' 'Osborn' and 'Carnage' Comics Announced|accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref> This was followed by another five-issue limited series titled ''Carnage U.S.A.'' and published 2011-2012.

He is set to return in the ''Superior Carnage'' storyline.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Cletus Kasady is a psychopath and a homicidal sadist. He is a deeply disturbed individual with a dark past: as a child, he killed his grandmother by pushing her down a flight of stairs, tried to murder his mother by throwing a hair dryer into her bathtub, and [[cruelty to animals|tortured]] and killed his mother's dog. After the latter, his mother then tried to kill Cletus, and was apparently beaten to the brink of death by Kasady's father, who received no defense from Kasady during the trial. As an [[orphan]], Kasady was sent to the St. Estes Home for Boys, where his [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] behavior made him the target of abuse from both the other orphans and the staff. Kasady gained revenge by murdering the disciplinarian administrator, pushing a girl (who laughed at him for asking to date her) in front of a moving bus, and burning down the orphanage. It was during his brutal years at St. Estes that Kasady acquired his philosophy that life was essentially meaningless and futile, that "laws are only words",<ref name="ASM 362">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #362</ref> and came to see the spreading of chaos through random, unpatterned bloodshed as "the ultimate freedom".<ref name="ASM 379">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #379</ref>

===Rebirth===
Cletus Kasady became a [[serial killer]]. He was then captured and sent to [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ryker's Island|Ryker's Island]] prison for 11 murders—though he bragged about killing a dozen more<ref name="ASM 361">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361</ref>—where he shared a [[prison cell|cell]] with [[Eddie Brock]], the host of the [[Venom (comics)|alien symbiote]] that turns into the supervillain Venom. When Brock's symbiote soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote unknowingly left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Kasady, transforming him into Carnage.<ref name="ASM 344-345">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344-345</ref>  He escaped prison,<ref name="ASM 359">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #359</ref> and began a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, wrote "Carnage" on the walls with his own blood. He was found by [[Spider-Man]], though the hero proved to be no match for Carnage's powers. In desperation, Spider-Man made a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.<ref name="ASM 361" /> Carnage was defeated with [[sonic weapon]]ry, but the symbiote lived on because it had become merged with Kasady's [[blood]]stream through a cut incurred during the fight.<ref name="Max Carnage">'''''Maximum Carnage''''': ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1-2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101-103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378-380; ''Spider-Man'' #35-37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201-203</ref>

===''Maximum Carnage''===
{{See also|Maximum Carnage}}
Cletus Kasady is taken to [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]], a prison for super-villains—then [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ravencroft|Ravencroft Institute]], a facility for the super-human criminally insane. A doctor at the facility, hoping to find a "cure" for his madness, draws blood from him—unwittingly enabling Kasady to transform into Carnage—who goes on to recruit an army of [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] supervillains including [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] to take over [[New York City]]. Using Shriek's "psychic channel" powers, he also drives ordinary New Yorkers to attack one another. Carnage and his "family" are ultimately driven back by Spider-Man, Venom and a number of other superheroes and super-[[antihero]]es, with Carnage and Shriek being remanded to Ravencroft.<ref name="Max Carnage"/>

===Web of Carnage===
During a subsequent jailbreak, he made it his mission to kill his only childhood friend Billy Bentime—hoping to refute the notion that friendship should be paid in kind. Carnage nearly defeated Spider-Man until Bentime tricked Carnage into reverting to human form, enabling Spider-Man to knock out Kasady with a simple punch.<ref name="ASM Annual 28">''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #28</ref>

Though bonded to Cletus Kasady's bloodstream, the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the institute's water pipes, overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson, and using him to commit further murders. It eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man—[[Ben Reilly]] at the time—when Ben bonded with it in order to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from him.<ref name="Spider-Carnage">''Sensational Spider-Man'' #3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #410, ''Spider-Man'' #67, and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233</ref>

===Cosmic Carnage===
During a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the [[Silver Surfer]] while visiting Earth at the time to welcome the [[Fantastic Four]] after their return to life following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Silver Surfer and Spider-Man were able to return the symbiote to Kasady, and Silver Surfer then sealed Kasady in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.<ref name="ASM 430-431">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430-431</ref>

===Death and resurrection===
Having tracked Cletus Kasady to a prison specially designed to hold him—how he escaped Silver Surfer's prison has yet to be established—Venom eventually reabsorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good". Without the symbiote, Kasady attempts to re-assume the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees, claiming that he still possesses at least some of Carnage's strength and convinced that he only needs to kill Spider-Man and Venom to regain his symbiote, but Spider-Man nevertheless easily defeats him in a fight.<ref name="PP: SM Vol2 13">''Peter Parker: Spider-Man, Vol. 2'' #13</ref> Kasady, however, eventually finds another symbiote who had been kept sealed in the [[Negative Zone]], and bonded with it to form the second Carnage.<ref name="Web-Spinners 14">''Web-Spinners'' #14</ref>

===Toxin===
Eventually, the Carnage symbiote reproduces, with Cletus Kasady implanting a spawn of it into Patrick "Paddy" Mulligan, an Irish-American police officer who was recently married and expecting a child. Mulligan became [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]—who single-handedly overpowered both Venom and Carnage. Nevertheless, Mulligan remained determined to use ''his'' new-found powers for good—learning as much as he can from Spider-Man—while leaving behind his wife and newborn son in order to protect them from danger.<ref name="Venom v Carnage 1-4">''Venom vs. Carnage'' #1-4</ref>

===Breakout===
Carnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].<ref name="The Avengers 1-2">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #1-2</ref> [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] flies Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] and rips him in two.

===Family Feud===
It is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth. The [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] return, hoping to repair the symbiote.<ref name= "Carnage">''Carnage'' #1-5</ref> Using the properties of the symbiote, Michael Hall, a competitor of Tony Stark, creates prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the Doppelganger. When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage.<ref name="Carnage" /> After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Cletus Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics.<ref name="Carnage"/> Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then bonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage for Spider-Man and Iron Man. Carnage, however, escapes with the Doppleganger and swears to make a bloody comeback.<ref name="Carnage" />

===Carnage USA===
In the aftermath of his return, Carnage sets off west to Doverton, Colorado.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa #1.</ref> He bonds most of the town to copies of his symbiote. [[Captain America]], Spider-Man, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempt to defeat him but all except Spider-Man are bonded to copies. With the Avengers team compromised and Spider-Man out of communication, they send in another team consisted of symbiote-enhanced special forces. Dr. Tanis Nieves as Scorn goes along with the separated parts of Hybrid which make up Agony, Phage, Riot, and Lasher, but they are heavily outnumbered since Carnage controls the entire town. Captain America breaks free of his hold long enough to make an emergency call for back up to none other than Venom. [[Flash Thompson]] in the Venom symbiote  sets off to Colorado to kill Carnage. The enhanced special forces keep fighting but Carnage sends the controlled Avengers after them, then was when Spider-Man comes with the unaffected residence of the town. The melee is particularly fierce when Venom intervenes with sonic rounds. Venom is about to kill Carnage with a gun in the mouth but Spider-Man stops him. Before Venom or Carnage can recover, Scorn uses a construction vehicle to carry the two to a device she built. She reveals that her device is meant to permanently remove the bonds from Carnage and Venom, but the hosts are still in there, leaving Cletus alone with a legless Flash Thompson. After the symbiotes fighting with themselves and the Avengers team, Venom finds its way back to Flash Thompson while Scorn is able to capture and contain the Carnage symbiote. The series ends with Cletus being captured and dragged into the back of a prison vehicle.<ref>''Carnage USA'' #1-5</ref>

===Minimum Carnage===
Carnage escapes prison yet again with the help of microns. Agent Venom is sent to the prison and discovers Kasady has escaped. Carnage flees to Houston, Texas and causes havoc, attracting the attention of the [[Scarlet Spider]]. Carnage takes the scientist Dr. Ketola, an expert in inter-dimensional transportation, as a hostage and escapes into the Microverse.<ref>''Minimum Carnage Alpha''</ref> He is defeated by Venom and Scarlet Spider, who use a sonic bomb from the Microverse to temporarily separate Kasady from the symbiote. Scarlet Spider then impales Kasady through the eye, lobotomizing him. Carnage goes into a catatonic state: The symbiote is keeping his body alive, similar to a life-support system, but Kasady's brain and mind are believed to be irreparably damaged, leaving the symbiote in control.<ref>''Minimum Carnage Omega''</ref>

===Superior Carnage===
Cletus Kasady, now lobotomized, later broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. Carnage breaks free from Wizard's control and nearly kills him, but is subdued by Klaw. Taking Carnage into their hideout, Wizard tries to take control of Cletus' mind, but fails due to it being too damaged. Wizard then transfers the Symbiote to Dr. Karl Malus. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influences of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renames him "Superior Carnage" and equips him with weapons.<ref name = "SupCar">''Superior Carnage'' #1-5</ref>

Malus tells Klaw not to be fooled as while he is forced to obey the Wizard, if his control slips the Symbiote will take control and turn against them. After taking all the weapons and starting to move to the city hall, Wizard blows up the hideout with Kasady still inside, seemingly killing him. While storming the city hall, Superior Carnage states that Kasady was a fool who wasted so much time on chaos while there was much more to be accomplished with a little focus. However, when Wizard's control slips for a moment Carnage begins to revert to his original form until Wizard regains himself.<ref name = "SupCar"/>

The trio are confronted by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] and during their battle the Wizard lose his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again, but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard. Ultimately, Spider-Man brings out Cletus' body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw focusses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Cletus' brain damage, followed by Kasady writing "CARNAGE RULES" on his cell wall.<ref name = "SupCar"/>

A piece of the symbiote (which had died in captivity) escapes containment and sets out in search of Cletus, who is bedridden due to having been stabbed by a fellow prison inmate. A doctor, anticipating that the symbiote will come seeking Cletus, smothers the killer in the infirmary, wanting the alien for himself. When the symbiote breaks into the facility, the doctor offers himself to the creature, but it rejects him, and returns to Cletus after resuscitating him. Carnage proceeds to asphyxiate the doctor, rampage through the prison, and escape.<ref name = "SCA">{{Cite comic| writer = [[Cullen Bunn]]| penciller = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| inker = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| story = | title = Superior Carnage Annual| volume = 1| issue = #1| date = 5 February 2014| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = United States| page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

===Deadpool vs. Carnage===
Much later, Carnage clashed with [[Deadpool]] believing it was his own destiny to hunt Carnage.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> When Carnage tore Deadpool to pieces, Deadpool bonded with the four symbiotes Phage, Riot, Lasher, and Agony.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #3</ref> Bonded with the four symbiotes, Deadpool tricked Shriek into thinking she killed Carnage. After that, Deadpool tricked Carnage by forcing Shriek to impersonate Deadpool and Carnage wounded Shriek in the process. Afterwards, Carnage, now broken that he almost killed Shriek, allows himself to be arrested by authorities and placed in an unlocked cell, waiting to be his own man. As he waited to be his own man, Carnage vowed revenge against Deadpool for tricking him.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #4</ref>

===AXIS===
During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] starts to recruit villains in order to combat the [[Red Skull|Red Onslaught]]. He manages to convince Carnage by saying he'll cause more chaos by becoming a savior and so Carnage agrees. When he sees Deadpool he tells him that they are "going to have words after this".<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref>

During the battle with Red Onslaught, [[Doctor Doom]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] cast a spell which alters the moralities of almost everyone present, Carnage included. Filled with the irresistible urge to be a hero, Carnage returns to New York and goes around "saving" people, largely oblivious to the fact that he is causing more harm than good.<ref name = "AxisC1">{{Cite comic

Faced with the threat of the morally-inverted [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] seeking to enforce their power and the inverted [[X-Men (comics)|X-Men]] working with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to take control of Manhattan, Spider-Man and the aged Steve Rogers are forced to work with Magneto and the "Astonishing Avengers" of Carnage and the other inverted villains.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #6</ref> Although unable to destroy the X-Men's gene-bomb, which would have killed all humans in the blast radius, Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast with his own symbiote, Spider-Man describing Kasady's sacrifice as the worst man he ever knew doing the most noble thing he'd ever seen.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #8</ref> With the crisis concluded, Peter Parker sets out to create a gold-and-rhinestone memorial to Carnage as he promised Cletus he would before his sacrifice.

===Post-AXIS===

However, Cletus Kasady was somehow able to cheat death again, though he lost the lower half of his body in the process, and went to Carefree, Arizona, to pay a visit to a new friend he made during the time he was inverted,<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #24</ref> a friend he was willing to "help", Sam Alexander aka [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]. Cletus left a message signaling his return in the form of murdering a random bystander who he had asked where to find the boy as proof that he was reverted to his more natural moral axis.<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #25</ref>

After learning that Sam's mother works at a local diner, Cletus took her hostage there in order to get his attention, but, tired of waiting, Cletus decided to kill her. Nova arrived before he could do so and took him away from the diner to an empty area in order not to hurt anyone. While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn't Sam Alexander, but the maniac didn't believe him. After being wounded by the Nova Force, Cletus fled in order to let his symbiote heal him as the police arrived. In the next day, already healed from his burns, Cletus attacked Sam again, this time at his school.<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #26</ref>

While attacking Sam at school, Carnage saw Nova flying around the area, thus making it impossible for the boy to be Nova (unbeknownst to him, that was Sam's mother wearing his helmet). Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try to get Nova's attention, which he got. A new battle ensued between them both. Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched him into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars' alarms, dizzying Cletus and his symbiote. Cletus was then thrown by Nova, who had already realized Carnage's weakness to high sounds, into [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] (a heavy metal band which Cletus was a fan of) show nearby. As the symbiote screamed in pain, Cletus fled from there to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Nova, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. Ready to finish off his opponent, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Nova and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds, from the time he had his moral axis inverted, from anyone who remembered it. He was left by Sam in Ryker's Island.<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #27</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main article|Symbiote (comics)}}
As Eddie Brock explained,<ref name="ASM 362" /> the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor—due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it—[[Earth]]. The alien symbiote endows Cletus Kasady with enhanced physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] combined<ref name="ASM 362" /> and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]].<ref name="Carnage: Mind Bomb">''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' one-shot</ref> Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]], as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to "see" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.<ref name="ASM 361" /><ref name="SMU 2">''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref> He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. The Carnage symbiote has similar abilities of that of Spider-Man's as a direct result of the Venom symbiote's first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.

He is able to rapidly regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human. It is not known, however, if he can fully regenerate severed limbs or missing internal organs; he was fitted with artificial legs after being torn apart by the Sentry, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote.<ref name="Carnage"/> Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom),<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004</ref> and is undetectable to Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]]. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.<ref name="ASM 361" /> Carnage also has the unique ability to warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords.

Kasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make his symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as "camouflage". With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can "regenerate" his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. His symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent's ([[Venom (comics)|Venom]]'s) ability to sense and track it.<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004" /> The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments; when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry,<ref name="New Avengers 1-2">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1-2</ref> the Carnage symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.<ref name="Carnage" />

In some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by only a mere touch.<ref name="New Avengers 1-2" />  The symbiote has also shown the ability to call back parts of itself back to the main symbiote, adding it to the parts that already make up the symbiote. It can also send commands that cannot be resisted to parts of itself that are in technology, used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, and consequently grew to an enormous size and assumed the color blue.<ref name="Carnage" />

Finally, Carnage's powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Cletus Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old onward.<ref name="SM 36">''Spider-Man'' #36</ref> Kasady sees "chaos" and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers "order" and virtue to be illusions.<ref name="ASM 361-363">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361-363</ref> He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem,<ref name="ASM 430-431" /> likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase "Carnage Rules" written in his own blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful of opponents and victims.<ref name="ASM 361-363" /> On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals in order to serve as witnesses for others—for instance, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]]'s wife Martha during ''Savage Rebirth''.<ref name="ASM 430">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430</ref> Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torment—both real and imagined—of his childhood.<ref name="SM 36" /><ref name="SM & B 1">''Spider-Man and Batman'' #1</ref>

==Other hosts==

Aside from Cletus Kasady, the Carnage symbiote bonds briefly with [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]],{{issue|date=January 2016}} before bonding with Ben Reilly, creating '''[[Ben Reilly|Spider-Carnage]]''',<ref name="Spider-Carnage" /> and later with the [[Silver Surfer]] to become '''[[Silver Surfer|Carnage Cosmic]]'''.<ref name="ASM 430-431" /> Later the suit forcefully bonds itself to [[Scorn (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Tanis Nieves]] after the apparent death of Cletus, in the process becoming the third Carnage.<ref name="Carnage" /><ref name="Zeb Wells: Carnage 2">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Zeb Wells]]|artist=[[Clayton Crain]]|title=Carnage #2|date=December 2010|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> In every case, however, the symbiote eventually returns to Kasady; one storyline saw a doctor deliberately trying to claim the symbiote for himself by killing Kasady while he was separated from the symbiote, but the symbiote bypassed him to restore Kasady.<ref name = "SCA"/>

==Other versions==

===Exiles===
The Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the "'''Spider'''", and becomes a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref name="Exiles 13">''Exiles'' #12</ref>

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage bonds with [[Spider-Girl]]'s friend, [[Moose Mansfied]].<ref name="ASG 9">''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9-12</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|little brother]], turning him into a miniature version of himself. Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.

In a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create "Biopreds", living weapons that the government use to try to stop '''Mayhem''', Spider-Girl's part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred.<ref name="SG: The End">''Spider-Girl: The End''</ref>

===Marvel 1602===
Following the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' crisis and the deaths of various Spider-Men, the new 'Web Warriors' - Spider-Men who travelled the parallel worlds to help realities that had lost their Spider-Men - visited the ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' universe, where they encountered a [[Sinister Six|Sinister Sextet]] led by '''Canice Cassidy''', who claimed to be possessed by a demon, although he was swiftly defeated by an acid that Pavitr Prabhakar had created to neutralise symbiotes.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol.4 #1</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created from DNA samples of both [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], and combined with samples from [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s [[Venom (comics)|symbiotic suit research]]. When first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including [[Gwen Stacy]], to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen's form.<ref name="USM 128">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128</ref><ref name="USM Images">{{cite web|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/dor/objects/739976/ultimate-spider-man/images/ultimate-spider-man-20081016061615870.html?page=mediaFull |title=Video Games, Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News & Videos - IGN |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Intercompany crossover===
Carnage teams up with and later turns against the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] during ''[[Spider-Man and Batman: Disordered Minds]]'' #1, the two men meeting when behavioral psychiatrist Cassandra Briar attempts to use the two men—regarded as humanity's most twisted minds—as tests for a chip she has developed that will allegedly 'lobotomise' their homicidal instincts. However, the Carnage symbiote neutralizes Kasady's chip after it is implanted, with Kasady simply pretending that the chip had worked so that he could meet the Joker. After Carnage removes Joker's chip, the two psychotics briefly enter into an alliance before their differing methods of murder cause a clash; Carnage favors numbers and actually seeing the death of his victims close-up in his murder sprees while the Joker prefers the artistry of his usual traps and tricks, Carnage dismissing the Joker's methods as slow while Joker sees Carnage as an amateur as anyone can just go out and kill people. Carnage responds by ambushing and threatening to kill [[Batman]] in order to be "theatrical". Carnage is defeated by Batman in the subsequent fight when he loses control of his symbiote while panicking after the Joker threatens to set off a bomb to destroy [[Gotham City|Gotham]]— himself and Carnage included— rather than see Carnage kill Batman. While defeating the shaken Kasady after his panic causes him to lose control of the symbiote, Batman reflects that many serial killers kill so many to try to escape death themselves by "appeasing" the Grim Reaper with their own sacrifices, and that Carnage—far from being a monster or even a "common street punk"— is little more than an overgrown "little boy", albeit with lethal powers.<ref name="SM & B 1" />

Carnage was also used in DC and Marvel's [[Amalgam Comics]], where he was amalgamated with [[Bizarro]] into ''Bizarnage'', an adversary of Spider-Boy who appeared in his only issue.<ref>''Spider-Boy'' #1''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.comicvine.com/bizarnage/4005-50812/issues-cover/ |title = Bizarnage |publisher = Comic Vine |website = Comic Vine |accessdate= 13 February 2014}}</ref>

===Television===
[[File:Carnage in Spider-Man The Animated Series.jpg|thumb|right|Carnage in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Carnage / Cletus Kasady appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]]. This version of Cletus Kasady was never shown killing anyone but still a deranged psychopath with a heavy criminal record. He appeared in the episodes "Venom Returns" and "Carnage". Cletus is captured by the police after planning to explode a bomb over New York. In prison, he shares a cell with [[Eddie Brock]]. After the original symbiote goes in their prison and rebonds with Brock and escapes, [[Baron Mordo]] appears in front of Cletus and explains that another symbiote has the same symbiotic powers. When Mordo makes a deal with this symbiote power in exchange for servitude to [[Dormammu]], Cletus accepts the offer and bonds with the new symbiote, turning into Carnage and escapes the prison. Carnage and Venom are given vampiric powers to steal life energy so that Dormammu can escape into this dimension and consume. Carnage mockingly refers to Venom as 'Dad'. Carnage abducts [[Ashley Kafka]], resulting in Venom teaming up with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Iron Man]]. After the final showdown, Carnage tried to drag Ashley into Dormammu's realm with him, but Eddie sacrificed himself to save Ashley and falls through the portal with Carnage. Carnage, Venom and Dormammu are ultimately imprisoned in Dormammu's dimension. In the episode "The Haunting of Mary Jane Watson", a robotic version of Carnage can be seen in [[Mysterio]]'s underground hideout. In the series finale, the Carnage symbiote bonds with an alternate version of Spider-Man to become [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Carnage]], thus Spider-Men from different dimensions undertake a mission to stop the [[Omnicide|omnicidal]] supervillain.
* Carnage / Cletus Kasady appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Michael Donovan]].<ref name="Michael Donovan">[http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html TV.com:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220125312/http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html |date=February 20, 2008 }} Michael Donovan Credits</ref> In this version, the symbiote is in complete control of it host, and works well with Venom. They traveled to Counter Earth to join the Symnoptic, a hive mind of symbiotes. In the series finale, the [[High Evolutionary]] separates Carnage and Venom from their respective hosts; Kasady is last seen as the Synoptic emerge on Counter-Earth.
* Cletus Kasady has a non-voiced [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. He is seen in the episode "Reinforcement" as a patient wearing a [[Santa Claus]] hat in [[list of correctional facilities in comics#Ravencroft|Ravencroft]] during a [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]] session with [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] when [[Kraven the Hunter]] attacks to break out the two villains. Carnage was originally slated to appear if the series had been renewed for a third season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/wordpress/2009/10/01/podcast-82-second-hour-of-spectacular-spider-man-interview/ |title=Podcast 82 September 2009 Second hour of Spectacular Spider-Man Interview |publisher=Spidermancrawlspace.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2011-02-08}}</ref>

In the episode "Carnage", the original form is created when the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] injects Peter Parker with a symbiote sample to become a perfect Venom but Peter's spider cells makes the organism unstable and imperfect. With Peter as his host, Carnage is sent by the Goblin to eliminate Spider-Man; the Goblin, while approving of this new 'son', didn't know Spider-Man and Peter are the same individual. Carnage attacks [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]]. Carnage fights through Spider-Man's allies but stops when [[Harry Osborn]] absorbs the symbiote to free Peter while Venom's form returns, leaving Carnage inactive. The second iteration later appears in ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'' as a completely different creature (otherwise known as '''[[Doctor Octopus|Carnage-Ock]]''' and '''[[Hulk (comics)|Carnage-Hulk]]''').<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=13|airdate=July 3, 2016}}</ref> The organism is the main focus in the three-part "Symbiote Saga" as a weaponized armor for [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. The new version is created by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] from a symbiote sample forcibly taken from Agent Venom. After being injected with Doctor Octopus's vampire bat DNA serum, Morbius retaliates by throwing the new symbiote on Doc Ock. Spider-Man and [[Flash Thompson]] then fight Carnage-Ock until Spider-Man uses a sound device, resulting in separation which also neutralized its host's nanites. Carnage then turns into its familiar form with a red-and-black hybrid look with black teeth, speaking and acting on its own, no longer needing a host to cause chaos. Carnage fights with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom, tricking the two young heroes into exploding himself so that the civilians below can become infected by the symbiote's fragments. The fragmented Carnage symbiote possess every civilian in Manhattan (including [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]). Spider-Man works with [[Captain America]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy to fight Carnage-Hulk and Carnage's various other hosts as the Carnage-possessed civilians causes [[Anti-Venom (comics)|Anti-Venom]]'s reawakening from [[Oscorp]]. While [[Mary Jane Watson]] (via Midtown High) uses [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]]' network to help innocent civilians, Spider-Man manages to gets Anti-Venom atop Carnage's 'heart' where Harry sacrifices the Anti-Venom symbiote to undo Carnage's control over everyone. However, Carnage reassembles into one giant creature that Spider-Man and Agent Venom fight, resulting in the creature enveloping Midtown High. Now a hive in Midtown High, Carnage's forms consists of miniature versions, Spider-like creatures and wasps-like creatures that Spider-Man, Agent Venom and Patrioteer fight before having a deadly encounter the '''[[Mary Jane Watson|Carnage Queen]]''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=15|airdate=July 17, 2016}}</ref>). Morbius and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] planned to use deactivated HYDRA missiles confiscated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] below Midtown High to send Carnage drones to every city in the world. After Crossbones' escape and Morbius' defeat, Mary Jane overcomes the Carnage Queen's control and Flash deactivates the Carnage-laces missiles. Eventually, Mary Jane embraces her Carnage Symbiote inside her and assumes the identity of Spider-Woman (referenced as Spider-MJ), thanks to Dr. Connor's experiment which help her control the symbiote completely.

S.H.I.E.L.D. began experimenting on Carnage and the fragment, combining them in hopes of creating a new kind of energy. Carnage absorbs the fragment and escapes containment, draining everyone coming across of energy and using the power of the tablet to reanimate them as mindless zombies (which slowly mutate into symbiote creatures like himself). Spider-Man pursues Carnage throughout the burning ruins of the Triskelion, dealing with the villain's spawn and [[Spider-Slayer]]s armed with flamethrowers (which identify Spider-Man as a threat due to his use of the symbiote-based Black Suit). Cornering his target on the highest floor of the Triskelion and gaining the assistance of some reprogrammed Spider-Slayers, Spider-Man defeats Carnage and retrieves the final fragment, leaving the creature pinned under rubble. During the credits, Carnage is shown posing for pictures in prison.
