'''Carnage''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #360.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #360">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_1_360|title=Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 360|work=Marvel Wiki}}</ref> Carnage was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]]. The character belongs to a race of amorphous [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]. He is usually depicted as an adversary to [[Spider-Man]], as well as serving as the archenemy of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. The symbiote has taken many hosts. The original and most notable host from [[Earth-616]] is '''[[Cletus Kasady]]''', a serial killer from the Marvel Universe. [[Norman Osborn]] and his grandson [[Normie Osborn]] have also used the symbiote and have been referred to as the '''Red Goblin'''.

In 2009, Carnage was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|title=Carnage is number 90|work=Comics|publisher=[[IGN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715065142/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|archivedate=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Writer [[David Michelinie]] created Carnage because he wanted to make a darker version of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]],<ref name="SM: Carnage">''Spider-Man: Carnage''</ref> intending to have Venom's human alter ego, [[Eddie Brock]], be killed off in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom's popularity increased, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character: a total psychopath who, unlike Venom, had no sense of morality. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"<ref name="Wizard">''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45</ref> and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage". Carnage's human component, Cletus Kasady, was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]], who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (character)|the Joker]].<ref name="Cletus Kasady question">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread) |accessdate=2007-06-24 |author=Erik Larsen |date=2007-03-27 |publisher=Image Comics Community |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210624/http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref> [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote.

In 1996, two one-shot comics entirely about Carnage were released, entitled ''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' and ''Carnage: It's A Wonderful Life'', both of which expand on his character.

After a 2004 appearance in ''[[List of New Avengers story arcs#Breakout (Issues #1-6)|New Avengers]]'' the character was presumed dead and was absent from comics for nearly six years. A 2010–2011 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''Carnage'' featured the return of the symbiote, where it temporarily found a new female host before reuniting with Kasady.<ref name="Carnage Female Host">{{cite web|last=George|first=Richard|title=SDCC 10: The Return of Carnage|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/07/25/sdcc-10-the-return-of-carnage|publisher=IGN}}</ref> The comic was released as a tie-in to the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/25/spider-man-big-time/ |title=Spider-Man: Big Time Begins, 'Spider-Girl,' 'Osborn' and 'Carnage' Comics Announced |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811014829/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/25/spider-man-big-time |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}</ref> This was followed by another five-issue limited series titled ''Carnage U.S.A.'' and published 2011–2012.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
When [[Eddie Brock]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Brock's cellmate [[Cletus Kasady]], transforming him into Carnage.<ref name="ASM 344-345">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #344–345</ref>  The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> He escaped prison,<ref name="ASM 359">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #359</ref> and began a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, wrote "Carnage" on the walls with his own blood. He was found by [[Spider-Man]] in Kasady's old orphanage, but Spider-Man proved to be no match for Carnage's powers and uncontrollable rage. In desperation, Spider-Man made a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.<ref name="ASM 361">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361</ref> The Carnage symbiote was defeated and apparently destroyed with [[sonic weapon]]ry, but unbeknownst to them the symbiote's deeper equilibrium with its host helped to save it. After entering Kasady's body through a small cut, it bonded to his blood (which caused its red coloration).<ref name="Max Carnage">'''''Maximum Carnage''''': ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #1–2; ''Web of Spider-Man'' #101–103; ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #378–380; ''Spider-Man'' #35–37; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #201–203</ref>

===''Maximum Carnage''===
{{See also|Maximum Carnage}}
Kasady is taken to [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]], a prison for super-villains—then Ravencroft Institute, a facility for the super-human criminally insane. A doctor at the facility, hoping to find a "cure" for his madness, draws blood from him—unwittingly enabling Kasady to transform into Carnage—who goes on to recruit an army of [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] supervillains including [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] to take over [[New York City]]. Using Shriek's "psychic channel" powers, he also drives ordinary New Yorkers to attack one another. Carnage and his "family" are ultimately driven back by Spider-Man, Venom and a number of other superheroes and super-[[antihero]]es, with Carnage and Shriek being remanded to Ravencroft.<ref name="Max Carnage"/>

===Venom vs. Carnage===
When a videogame is created starring Carnage, the symbiote breaks out of confinement by somehow going through the computer monitor. After causing havok at Ravencroft he attacks Venom, who manages to defeat him and return him to Ravencroft Institute.<ref name="Venom #1-4">Venom #1-4</ref>

===Bonding with John Jameson===
{{Main|John Jameson (comics)}} 
Though bonded to Kasady's bloodstream the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute's water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft's chief, John Jameson. Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-man, who was Ben Reilly at the time.<ref name="Spider-Carnage"/>

===Spider-Carnage===
{{Main|Ben Reilly}} 
It eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man—[[Ben Reilly]] at the time—when Ben bonded with it in order to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben's willpower held out against the symbiote's murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from him.<ref name="Spider-Carnage">''Sensational Spider-Man'' #3, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #410, ''Spider-Man'' #67, and ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #233</ref>

===Carnage Cosmic===
{{Main|Silver Surfer}} 
During a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the [[Silver Surfer]], who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the [[Fantastic Four]] after their return to life following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. As it turned out, [[Galactus]] had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus's herald at the time. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic. Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.<ref name="ASM 430-431">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430–431</ref>

===Venom Victorious===
Having tracked Kasady to a prison specially designed to hold him, Venom eventually reabsorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good" by eating it.

===Symbiotic Resurrection===
Kasady escaped from prison and was chased by Spider-Man before the two were sucked into the [[Negative Zone]]. Spider-Man teams up with a Negative Zone hero named [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]] while Kasady teamed up with a villain named [[Blastaar]] who was bent on destroying the world. While in the Negative Zone, Kasady found another Symbiote who he bonded with, which allowed the few remains of the Carnage symbiote inside of Cletus to absorb it and resurrect itself in the process to once again become Carnage.<ref name="Web-Spinners 14">''Web-Spinners'' #14</ref>

===Toxin===
{{Main|Toxin (comics)}} 
Eventually, the Carnage symbiote reproduces, with Kasady implanting a spawn of it into Patrick "Paddy" Mulligan, an Irish-American police officer who was recently married and expecting a child. Mulligan became [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]—who single-handedly overpowered both Venom and Carnage. Nevertheless, Mulligan remained determined to use ''his'' new-found powers for good—learning as much as he can from Spider-Man—while leaving behind his wife and newborn son in order to protect them from danger.<ref name="Venom v Carnage 1-4">''Venom vs. Carnage'' #1–4</ref>

===Breakout===
Carnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from The Raft.<ref name="The Avengers 1-2">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #1–2</ref> [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] flies Carnage outside the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] and rips him in two.

===Family Feud===
It is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth. The [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] return, hoping to repair the symbiote.<ref name= "Carnage">''Carnage'' #1–5</ref> Using the properties of the symbiote, Michael Hall, a competitor of Tony Stark, creates prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the Doppelganger. When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage.<ref name="Carnage" /> After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall's prosthetics.<ref name="Carnage"/> Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit's spawn briefly bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek's malice, the symbiote arm then bonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage for Spider-Man and Iron Man. Carnage, however, escapes with the Doppelganger and swears to make a bloody comeback.<ref name="Carnage" />

===Carnage USA===
In the aftermath of his return, Carnage sets off west to Doverton, Colorado.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712033608/http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa# |date=2012-07-12 }} #1.</ref> He bonds most of the town to copies of his symbiote. [[Captain America]], Spider-Man, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempt to defeat him but all except Spider-Man are bonded to copies. With the Avengers team compromised and Spider-Man out of communication, they send in another team consisted of symbiote-enhanced special forces. Dr. Tanis Nieves as Scorn goes along with the separated parts of Hybrid which make up Agony, Phage, Riot, and Lasher, but they are heavily outnumbered since Carnage controls the entire town. Captain America breaks free of his hold long enough to make an emergency call for back up to none other than Venom. [[Flash Thompson]] in the Venom symbiote  sets off to Colorado to kill Carnage. The enhanced special forces keep fighting but Carnage sends the controlled Avengers after them, that was when Spider-Man comes with the unaffected residents of the town. The melee is particularly fierce when Venom intervenes with sonic rounds. Venom is about to kill Carnage with a gun in the mouth but Spider-Man stops him. Before Venom or Carnage can recover, Scorn uses a construction vehicle to carry the two to a device she built. She reveals that her device is meant to permanently remove the bonds from Carnage and Venom, but the hosts are still in there, leaving Kasady alone with a legless Flash Thompson. After the symbiotes fighting with themselves and the Avengers team, Venom finds its way back to Flash Thompson while Scorn is able to capture and contain the Carnage symbiote. The series ends with Kasady being captured and dragged into the back of a prison vehicle.<ref>''Carnage USA'' #1–5</ref>

===Minimum Carnage===
Carnage escapes prison yet again with the help of microns. Agent Venom is sent to the prison and discovers Kasady has escaped. Carnage flees to Houston, Texas and causes havoc, attracting the attention of the [[Scarlet Spider]]. Carnage takes the scientist Dr. Ketola, an expert in inter-dimensional transportation, as a hostage and escapes into the Microverse.<ref>''Minimum Carnage Alpha''</ref> He is defeated by Venom and Scarlet Spider, who use a sonic bomb from the Microverse to temporarily separate Kasady from the symbiote. Scarlet Spider then impales Kasady through the eye, lobotomizing him. Carnage goes into a catatonic state: The symbiote is keeping his body alive, similar to a life-support system, but Kasady's brain and mind are believed to be irreparably damaged, leaving the symbiote in control.<ref>''Minimum Carnage Omega''</ref>

===Superior Carnage===
{{Main|Karl Malus}} 
Kasady, now lobotomized, later broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. Carnage breaks free from Wizard's control and nearly kills him, but is subdued by Klaw. Taking Carnage into their hideout, Wizard tries to take control of Kasady's mind, but fails due to it being too damaged. Wizard then transfers the Symbiote to Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influences of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renames him "Superior Carnage" and equips him with weapons.<ref name = "SupCar">''Superior Carnage'' #1–5</ref>

Malus tells Klaw not to be fooled as while he is forced to obey the Wizard, if his control slips the Symbiote will take control and turn against them. After taking all the weapons and starting to move to the city hall, Wizard blows up the hideout with Kasady still inside, seemingly killing him. While storming the city hall, Superior Carnage states that Kasady was a fool who wasted so much time on chaos while there was much more to be accomplished with a little focus. However, when Wizard's control slips for a moment Carnage begins to revert to his original form until Wizard regains himself.<ref name = "SupCar"/>

The trio are confronted by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] and during their battle the Wizard loses his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured once Spider-Man accidentally drops him due to the shock of finding out Wizard read his mind and knows about Otto Octvaius. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again, but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard. Ultimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady's body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard's and Kasady's brain damage, followed by Kasady writing "CARNAGE RULES" on his cell wall.<ref name = "SupCar"/>

A piece of the symbiote (which had died in captivity) escapes containment and sets out in search of Kasady, who is bedridden due to having been stabbed by a fellow prison inmate. A doctor, anticipating that the symbiote will come seeking Kasady, smothers the killer in the infirmary, wanting the alien for himself. When the symbiote breaks into the facility, the doctor offers himself to the creature, but it rejects him, and returns to Kasady after resuscitating him. Carnage proceeds to asphyxiate the doctor, rampage through the prison, and escape.<ref name = "SCA">{{Cite comic| writer = [[Cullen Bunn]]| penciller = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| inker = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| story = | title = Superior Carnage Annual| volume = 1| issue = #1| date = 5 February 2014| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = United States| page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

===Deadpool vs. Carnage===
Much later, Carnage clashed with [[Deadpool]] believing it was his own destiny to hunt Carnage.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> When Carnage tore Deadpool to pieces, Deadpool bonded with the four symbiotes Phage, Riot, Lasher, and Agony.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #3</ref> Bonded with the four symbiotes, Deadpool tricked Shriek into thinking she killed Carnage. After that, Deadpool tricked Carnage by forcing Shriek to impersonate Deadpool and Carnage wounded Shriek in the process. Afterwards, Carnage, now broken that he almost killed Shriek, allows himself to be arrested by authorities and placed in an unlocked cell,  Carnage vowed revenge against Deadpool for tricking him.<ref>''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #4</ref> After all this is over, Deadpool transfers the four symbiotes over to a dog.

===AXIS===
During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] starts to recruit villains in order to combat the [[Red Skull|Red Onslaught]]. He manages to convince Carnage by saying he'll cause more chaos by becoming a savior and so Carnage agrees. When he sees Deadpool he tells him that they are "going to have words after this".<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref>

During the battle with Red Onslaught, [[Doctor Doom]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] cast a spell which alters the moralities of almost everyone present, Carnage included. Filled with the irresistible urge to be a hero, Carnage returns to New York and goes around "saving" people, largely oblivious to the fact that he is causing more harm than good.<ref name = "AxisC1">{{Cite comic

Faced with the threat of the morally-inverted [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] seeking to enforce their power and the inverted [[X-Men (comics)|X-Men]] working with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to take control of Manhattan, Spider-Man and the aged Steve Rogers are forced to work with Magneto and the "Astonishing Avengers" of Carnage and the other inverted villains.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #6</ref> Although unable to destroy the X-Men's gene-bomb, which would have killed all humans in the blast radius, Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast with his own symbiote, Spider-Man describing Kasady's sacrifice as the worst man he ever knew doing the most noble thing he'd ever seen.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #8</ref> With the crisis concluded, Peter Parker sets out to create a gold-and-rhinestone memorial to Carnage as he promised Kasady he would before his sacrifice.

===Post-AXIS===

However, Kasady was somehow able to cheat death again, though he lost the lower half of his body in the process, and went to Carefree, Arizona, to pay a visit to a new friend he made during the time he was inverted,<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #24</ref> a friend he was willing to "help", Sam Alexander aka [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]. Kasady left a message signaling his return in the form of murdering a random bystander whom he had asked where to find the boy as proof that he was reverted to his more natural moral axis.<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #25</ref>

After learning that Sam's mother works at a local diner, Kasady took her hostage there in order to get his attention, but, tired of waiting, Kasady decided to kill her. Nova arrived before he could do so and took him away from the diner to an empty area in order not to hurt anyone. While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn't Sam Alexander, but the maniac didn't believe him. After being wounded by the Nova Force, Kasady fled in order to let his symbiote heal him as the police arrived. In the next day, already healed from his burns, Kasady attacked Sam again, this time at his school.<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #26</ref>

While attacking Sam at school, Carnage saw Nova flying around the area, thus making it impossible for the boy to be Nova (unbeknownst to him, that was Sam's mother wearing his helmet). Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try to get Nova's attention, which he got. A new battle ensued between them both. Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched him into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars' alarms, dizzying Kasady and his symbiote. Kasady was then thrown by Nova, who had already realized Carnage's weakness to high sounds, into an [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] (a heavy metal band which Kasady was a fan of) show nearby. As the symbiote screamed in pain, Kasady fled from there to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Nova, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. Ready to finish off his opponent, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Nova and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds, from the time he had his moral axis inverted, from anyone who remembered it. He was left by Sam in Ryker's Island.<ref>''Nova'' (vol 5) #27</ref>

=== Carnage Solo series ===
When Cletus escaped as usual, he found out that one woman had survived one of his first slaughters. Enraged, he went after her only to find out that it was a trap orchestrated by FBI agent Claire Dixon, John Jameson as Man-Wolf and Eddie Brock as Toxin. They started to battle, but the mine they were in started to crumble. He suddenly met a cultist who worships [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] and told him that he is part of the [[Darkhold]] prophesy and spilled his blood on the book giving Carnage new supernatural powers.<ref>''Carnage The One Who Got Away.''

After that, Carnage hijacked a boat in order to resurrect Chthon and be rewarded. When Claire's team got to the boat, she was abducted by Carnage and he bonded her to his third offspring, Raze. Next, the team tried to kill Carnage by exploding the boat. Cletus was rescued by a young girl named Jubil, not knowing who he was. He tried to infect her with his symbiote, but she proved to be immune to him. She exploded her boat in an effort to get rid of Carnage.<ref>''Carnage World Tour'' Vol. 2 Marvel Comics.</ref>

Carnage survived and went to the island where he could resurrect Chthon. The team, along with Jubil, went to the island and found countless dead bodies. Carnage finally resurrects Chthon, only to pushed aside by him. Since Jubil had a piece of the power from Carnage, Eddie Brock gave his Toxin symbiote to her and she with the symbiote took the form of an Angelic Knight and defeated Chthon, resulting in the apparent death of Toxin. Carnage now furious, tried to kill the team, until Claire (who got rid of her symbiote) sacrificed herself to save the others. Then the team used the Darkhold against Carnage by separating the symbiote from Cletus.<ref>''Carnage What Dwells Beneath'' Vol 3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Red Goblin===
{{Main|Norman Osborn|Normie Osborn}}
Following [[Secret Empire (comics)|Hydra's coup of America]], the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless [[Norman Osborn]].<ref name="ASM 794">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #794</ref> He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote's desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #795</ref> but he has been able to 'persuade' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage's powers to show it something other than 'boring' mindless slaughter.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #796</ref> Using this combination of powers during the "Go Down Swinging" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through Human Torch, [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], and Agent Anti-Venom, with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #799</ref> The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe's mind. Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it's revealed that Norman's mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is actually Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady. It's not clear whether or not he's faking it or if he had actually lost his mind. Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie. Not all of it has gone.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #800</ref>

===Carnage Born===
Cletus's body had only been partially consumed by the Poison, enabling the Carnage symbiote to regenerate and destroy it. The symbiote then steered Cletus's body back to Earth and despite its Darkhold-augmentations, Cletus' body was badly damaged and leaving him badly burnt but alive. After the cult dedicated to worshipping Knull, led by a corrupted Scorn, retrieved Cletus's body and stole a sample of the Grendel symbiote from the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]]'s laboratory, they wanted to bond the Grendel symbiote to Cletus, so he could be psychically connected to Knull through the codex, trace remnants of Knull's left over on the dragon's body. Cletus was then revived when they successfully implanted the Grendel symbiote, and escaped from the chamber resembling at first the Ancient Venom (Venom possessed by Knull), but this only lasted temporarily with Cletus ripping out Scorn's spine in order to consumed the trace remnants of the Carnage symbiote left over from her time as its host. Amalgamating the Grendel and Carnage symbiotes, Cletus decided to help free Knull and set out to hunt down and consume the codexes of the other symbiote hosts, living and deceased.<ref>''Web of Venom Carnage Born''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)}}
As Eddie Brock explained,<ref name="ASM 362" >The Amazing Spider-Man #362</ref> the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor—due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it—[[Earth]]. The alien symbiote endows Kasady with physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] combined<ref name="ASM 362" /> and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person's head using a symbiote [[tendril]].<ref name="Carnage: Mind Bomb">''Carnage: Mind Bomb'' one-shot</ref> Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man's spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to "see" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.<ref name="ASM 361" /><ref name="SMU 2">''Spider-Man Unlimited #2''</ref> He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. The Carnage symbiote has abilities similar to that of Spider-Man as a direct result of the Venom symbiote's first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man's power into the symbiote.

He is able to regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than that of an ordinary human. This has been shown as powerful enough to allow him to regenerate from decapitation.<ref name="Venom Vol 2 #27">''Venom Vol 2 #27''</ref><ref name="AXIS: Carnage #3">''AXIS:Carnage #3''</ref> However, after being torn in half by the Sentry, he was fitted with artificial legs, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote.<ref name="Carnage"/> Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom),<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004">''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man'', 2004</ref> and is undetectable to Spider-Man's spider-sense. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage's body.<ref name="ASM 361" /> Carnage also has the unique ability to warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords.

Kasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make his symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as "camouflage". With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can "regenerate" his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. His symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent's ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]'s) ability to sense and track it.<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004" /> The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments: when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry,<ref name="New Avengers 1-2">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1–2</ref> the Carnage symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.<ref name="Carnage" />

In some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by only a mere touch.<ref name="New Avengers 1-2" />  The symbiote has also shown the ability to call parts of itself back to the main symbiote, reintegrating them. It can also send irresistible commands to parts of itself that are in technology; these were used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, grew to an enormous size, and became blue.<ref name="Carnage" />

Finally, Carnage's powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old.<ref name="SM 36">''Spider-Man'' #36</ref> Kasady sees chaos and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers order and virtue to be illusions.<ref name="ASM 361-363">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #361–363</ref> He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem,<ref name="ASM 430-431" /> likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase "Carnage Rules" written in his own blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful opponents and victims.<ref name="ASM 361-363" /> On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals to serve as witnesses for others: for instance, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]]'s wife Martha during ''Savage Rebirth''.<ref name="ASM 430">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430</ref> Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torments, both real and imagined, of his childhood.<ref name="SM 36" /><ref name="SM & B 1">''Spider-Man and Batman'' #1</ref>

When the Carnage symbiote was joined with Norman Osborn, the resulting combination was immune to traditional symbiote weaknesses of sound and fire, although Anti-Venom's touch was still dangerous.

==Other versions==

===Exiles===
The Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the "'''Spider'''", and becomes a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.<ref name="Exiles 13">''Exiles'' #12</ref>

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage bonds with [[Spider-Girl]]'s friend, [[Moose Mansfied]].<ref name="ASG 9">''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #9–12</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl's [[Benjamin Richard Parker|little brother]], turning him into a miniature version of himself. Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.

In a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create "Biopreds", living weapons that the government use to try to stop '''Mayhem''', Spider-Girl's part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds' creation never occurred.<ref name="SG: The End">''Spider-Girl: The End''</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created from DNA samples of both [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], and combined with samples from [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|symbiotic suit research]]. When first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including [[Gwen Stacy]], to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen's form.<ref name="USM 128">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128</ref><ref name="USM Images">{{cite web|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/dor/objects/739976/ultimate-spider-man/images/ultimate-spider-man-20081016061615870.html?page=mediaFull |title=Video Games, Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News & Videos – IGN |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Venomverse===
When Venom and Eddie Brock from Prime Earth were recruited into a war between lethal protectors from across the multiverse and the symbiote-eating Poisons, the Venoms from the multiverse were on the ropes until Eddie had the bright idea to recruit the psychopath Carnage to their side. They summoned a Carnage that hailed from a world where he had succeeded in killing Venom, and while he was volatile at first, engaging in battle with the Resistance, when he realized he had the opportunity to fight "a buncha messed-up super-heroes" he decided to join the Venoms.<ref>''Venomverse'' #3</ref> For some reason, Carnage was immune to the Poisons, and he helped tip the scales in their favor as one last ditch suicide run and was left for dead alongside Poison Deadpool, and was seemingly killed when the Hive's ship was destroyed, after the heroes were sent back to their respective dimensions.<ref>''Venomverse'' #5</ref>

===Television===
[[File:Carnage in Spider-Man The Animated Series.jpg|thumb|right|Cletus Kasady as Carnage in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* The Carnage symbiote appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', with [[Cletus Kasady]] voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]] and [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Carnage]] voiced by [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]]. This original depiction appeared in the episodes "Venom Returns", "Carnage" and "The Haunting of Mary Jane Watson". In the series finale, the Carnage symbiote bonds with an alternate version of Spider-Man to be Spider-Carnage, thus Spider-Men from different dimensions undertake a mission to stop the [[Omnicide|omnicidal]] supervillain.
* The Cletus Kasady version of Carnage appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Michael Donovan]].<ref name="Michael Donovan">[http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html TV.com:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220125312/http://www.tv.com/michael-donovan/person/10761/appearances.html |date=February 20, 2008 }} Michael Donovan Credits</ref>

In its self-titled episode "Carnage", the original version is created when the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] injects Peter Parker with a symbiote sample to be a perfect Venom but Peter's spider cells makes the organism unstable and imperfect. With Peter as its host, Carnage is sent by the Goblin to eliminate Spider-Man; the Goblin, while approving of this new 'son', didn't know Spider-Man and Peter are the same individual. Carnage attacks [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]], fighting through Spider-Man's allies but stops when [[Harry Osborn]] absorbs the Carnage symbiote to free Peter while Venom's form returns which leaves Carnage inactive. The second iteration later appears in ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'' as a completely different creature.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=13|airdate=July 3, 2016}}</ref> This version is the main focus in "The Symbiote Saga" three-parter as a weaponized symbiote for [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. Created by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] from a symbiote sample forcibly taken from Agent Venom, Morbius throws the Carnage symbiote on Doc Ock after being injected with Doc Ock's vampire bat serum. Spider-Man and [[Flash Thompson]] then fight '''[[Doctor Octopus|Carnage-Ock]]''' until Spider-Man uses a sound device, resulting in separation which also neutralized its host's nanites. Carnage then turns into his familiar form with a red-and-black hybrid look with black teeth, speaking and acting on its own, no longer needing a host to cause chaos. Carnage fights with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom, tricking the two young heroes into exploding itself so that the civilians below can become infected by its fragments. The fragmented Carnage symbiote possesses every civilian in Manhattan (including [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]). Spider-Man works with [[Captain America]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy to fight '''[[Hulk (comics)|Carnage-Hulk]]''' and various other civilian hosts, resulting in the [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] symbiote's reawakening from [[Oscorp]]. While [[Mary Jane Watson]] (via Midtown High) uses [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]]' network to help innocent civilians, Spider-Man manages to gets Anti-Venom atop Carnage's 'heart' where the Anti-Venom symbiote is sacrificed to undo Carnage's control over everyone. However, the Carnage symbiote reassembles into a giant creature that Spider-Man and Agent Venom fight, resulting in the creature enveloping Midtown High. Now a hive in Midtown High, Carnage's forms (miniature versions, Spider-like creatures and wasps-like creatures) are fought by Spider-Man, Agent Venom and the Patrioteer fight before having a deadly encounter with the '''[[Mary Jane Watson|Carnage Queen]]''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=15|airdate=July 17, 2016}}</ref>). The Living Vampire and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] plan to use deactivated HYDRA missiles confiscated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] below Midtown High to send drones equipped with the Carnage symbiote to every city in the world. After Crossbones's escape and the Living Vampire's defeat, Mary Jane overcomes the Carnage symbiote and Flash deactivates the missiles. "The Spider-Slayers" revealed Mary Jane embraces the Carnage symbiote within and assumes the Spider-Woman identity (referenced as Spider-MJ) thanks to Dr. Curt Connors's experiment which help control the organism completely.
*The Carnage symbiote appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' animated series.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Back in the New York Groove|series=Guardians of the Galaxy|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=1|airdate=March 18, 2018}}</ref> This version is created by [[Thanos]] during an experiment with the symbiotes, genetically modified to be obedient to the Titan and enabled to control all other symbiotes and their hosts. In the episodes "Back in the New York Groove" and "Drive My Carnage", the Carnage symbiote freed Thanos after Thanos gets buried under Manhattan and bonded with the Titan to commence spreading itself across the city before Carnage is destroyed by the Guardians of the Galaxy and Spider-Man.

===Attractions===
During the 2002 [[Halloween Horror Nights]], [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] featured a haunted maze entitled "Maximum Carnage". The maze was designed to be a trip through Carnage's hideout and contained all his henchmen and the bloody remains of various Marvel superheroes. The house was located at [[Marvel Super Hero Island]] under the scarezone "Island Under Siege". Carnage also was the icon chosen to represent that specific island for the event, as he killed all of the superheroes and took over the "island", allowing criminals, gangbangers, and villains to roam free with no regards to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The event's main icon, "The Caretaker", chose him based on his disregard for life and desire to see total chaos.<ref name="Horror Nights">{{cite web|url=http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001073503/http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 October 2002|title=Hallowen Horror Nights|date=1 October 2002|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="Open The Vault">[http://www.hhnvault.com/haunts/hhn12_houses.htm Open the Vault.
