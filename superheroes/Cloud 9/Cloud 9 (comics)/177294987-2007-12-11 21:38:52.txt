'''Cloud 9''' ('''Abigail''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[teenage]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She was created by writer [[Dan Slott]] and artist [[Stefano Caselli]], and first appeared in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1 (June 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
She first demonstrated her powers while flying on the cloud in [[Evanston]], [[Illinois]]. She was spotted by the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program and was recruited into it by [[War Machine]], who told Abi that if she wanted to keep on flying, she needed a license. Once at the base, Abi was discovered to actually be a very shy girl and self-conscious about her body, comparing it to the other girls' bodies there who she felt looked like they came right out of [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] magazine. During a uniform exchange, Abi accidentally slipped into the boys' showers and was found by fellow new hero [[MVP (comics)|MVP]]. He took a liking to Abi and watched her train. However, when the training with another new hero, [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], went wrong, MVP was shot by one of Armory's blasts while he was trying to protect Abi from harm. Armory was grounded from superhero-ing and expelled out of the base. In the second issue, Abi is one of the cadets sent on an emergency mission to protect the President from an assassination attempt by [[HYDRA]]. It is revealed that she is the top marksman among the Initiative cadets, and she shoots down a Hydra fighter with a pulse rifle.

She has stated that she has no intention of superhuman heroics. As she puts it, "I'm only here because I want to fly. Man, this blows."

==Powers and abilities==
Abi apparently has the ability to create a unidentified cloud-like gas form on which she can fly. She can also use this gas in an offensive manner, asphyxiating [[Elloe Kaifi (comics)|Elloe Kaifi]], one of the Hulk's [[Warbound]] by filling her lungs with it.

Gauntlet has stated that Abi is one of the better marksmen in the Initiative.
