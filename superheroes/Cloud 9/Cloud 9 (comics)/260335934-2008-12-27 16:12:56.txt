'''Cloud 9''' ('''Abigail "Abby" Boylen'''<ref>Last name revealed in ''Avengers: The Initiative #11</ref>) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[teenage]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She was created by writer [[Dan Slott]] and artist [[Stefano Caselli]], and first appeared in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1 (June 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
She first demonstrated her powers while flying on the cloud in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. She was spotted by the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program and was recruited into it by [[War Machine]], who told Abby that if she wanted to keep on flying, she needed a license. Once at the base, Abby was discovered to actually be a very shy girl and self-conscious about her body, comparing it to the other girls' bodies there who she felt looked like they came right out of [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] magazine. During a uniform exchange, Abby accidentally slipped into the boys' showers and was found by fellow new hero [[MVP (comics)|MVP]]. He took a liking to Abby and watched her train. However, when the training with another new hero, [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], went wrong, MVP was shot by one of Armory's blasts while he was trying to protect Abby from harm. Armory was grounded from superhero-ing and expelled out of the base.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1</ref> Abby is one of the cadets sent on an emergency mission to protect the President from an assassination attempt by [[HYDRA]]. It is revealed that she is the top marksman among the Initiative cadets, and she shoots down a HYDRA fighter with a pulse rifle.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2</ref>

She has stated that she has no intention of superhuman heroics. As she puts it, "I'm only here because I want to fly. Man, this blows."

During the "Killed In Action" story arc, Abby learns that the Initiative had secretly made clones of MVP, and that one of one, who dubs himself [[KIA (comics)|KIA]], has gone on a rampage. She and a group of fellow Initiative members travel to the Van Patrick home, attempting to convince the first MVP clone to download his memories into a device that will transmit them into KIA's brain, essentially reprogramming KIA, but possibly leaving the first clone mindless. Cloud 9 manages to distract KIA by playing on the latent memories of the original MVP, and kissing him, allowing her to fill his lungs with her vapor. The MVP clone, rather than wipe his own mind, instead places the helmet on KIA, leaving him an empty shell. Abby and the clone decide to start things over, with Abby acknowledging that the clone is not the MVP she knew.

When Cloud 9 completed her Initiative training, she was assigned to [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]; the [[Montana]] team. She is then seen in action alongside [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], Think Tank, [[Equinox (comics)|Equinox]], and Spinner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> When Equinox is revealed to be a Skrull infiltrator, it is Cloud 9 who kills Equinox.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Abigail apparently has the ability to create an unidentified cloud-like gas form on which she can fly. She can also use this gas in an offensive manner, asphyxiating [[Elloe Kaifi]], one of the Hulk's [[Warbound]] by filling her lungs with it.

Cloud 9 has a rating of below class 50. However, Abigail is one of the better marksmen in the Initiative with [[War Machine]] stating she had the highest cadet score on the shooting range.<ref>Avengers: The Initiative #2</ref>
