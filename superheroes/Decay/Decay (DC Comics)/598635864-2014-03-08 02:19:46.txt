'''Decay''' is a [[fictional character]] owned by [[DC Comics]]. She appears as a villain in the ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' [[comic book]] series.

==Fictional character biography==
To win the approval of his father [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the minor god [[Children of Ares (comics)|Phobos]] (god of fear) journeyed to the Cavern of the [[Gorgons]] where he molded a statuette from malevolent matter scoured from [[Medusa]]'s heart.  He then arranged for the item to be delivered to the [[Julia Kapatelis|Kapatelis]] residence, a friend of Wonder Woman. It was here that Wonder Woman, also known as Diana, was rooming as she oriented herself to life off of her island home [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #3</ref>

As Phobos arranged, once the statuette (named '''Decay''') was delivered, it came to life in the hands of [[Vanessa Kapatelis]]. Decay then forcibly aged Vanessa after she had touched her. Decay then destroyed the Kapatelis home in her first attempt to kill Diana.  Failing that, Decay gleefully went on the destructive rampage in the city of [[Boston]] with Diana in pursuit.  After a dangerous battle which resulted in Wonder Woman being aged as well, Diana realized the proper way to defeat the monster.  She snared Decay in her [[Lasso of Truth]], which is also tied to the renewing power of [[Gaea (mythology)|Gaia]], Goddess of the Earth.  Bombarded with this power, Decay was reduced to dust while Diana's youth was restored.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #4</ref> A short time later, Diana obtained a magic ointment to restore Vanessa's youth as well.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #7</ref>

Decay was resurrected by Dr. Julian Lazarus's Virtual Reanimator, which brought the demon of destruction back to life with its experimental proto-matrix material, Wonder Woman missing the resurrection because she was occupied fighting a duplicate of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] that Lazarus's machine had unintentionally created earlier. While Decay's body was merely an artificial effigy, the demon's spirit possessed the copy of her former self as her own.  But before Decay could secure the power source needed to maintain her imitation of life, Diana shattered the virtual clone into a million pieces.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #112-113</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Decay is a skilled fighter possessing the powers of flight and invulnerability. Her touch causes any living thing she comes in contact with to rapidly age, eventually causing death. Decay's breath is equally deadly, and can crumble a target to dust.

==Daniel Pendergast==
A delusional researcher at the Institute for Higher Psychokinetic Study, Daniel Pendergast observed modern society as "decay" and manipulated psionic Gayle Marsh into becoming the super-villainess Psi to help him destroy civilization under the ambiguous definition of wiping out "decay." Psi would trade blows with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and be defeated, returning to Pendergast. He attempted to kill her for her failure and she instinctively lashed out, turning him into a hulking monster of decay. He set himself upon [[Chicago]] and began to melt and consume matter, battling Supergirl, before Psi would appear and revert him back to his human form. Introduced in ''Daring New Adventures of Supergirl'' #1 (November 1982).
