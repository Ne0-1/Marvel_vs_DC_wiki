'''Johnny Sorrow''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[publications]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999) and was created by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[David Goyer]] and artist [[Phil Winslade]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=277}}</ref> though he was first mentioned in passing in ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'' #8 (June 1995) in a story written by James Robinson.

==Publication history==
First mentioned in the storyline "A Knight in the Circus" in ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'' #8 (June 1995), Johnny Sorrow debuted in ''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999), and was, according to writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]], "...a continuity implant. While purportedly a Golden Age villain...around since the 1940s, Sorrow didn't make his first appearance until more than 50 years later".<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

After an initial defeat, a greatly changed Sorrow reappeared with a new version of the [[Injustice Society]] in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #9 - 10 (April - May 2000), and makes a brief appearance in ''Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E'' #13 (Aug. 2000). The character returned in a storyline that detailed the origin of his new powers in ''JSA'' #16 - 20 (Nov. 2000 - March 2001), and then the [[graphic novel]] ''Virtue and Vice'' (Jan. 2002), battling both the Justice Society and the ''[[Justice League of America|JLA]]'' with ally [[Despero]]. Johnny Sorrow and another version of the Injustice Society appeared in ''[[JSA All-Stars]]'' #1 (Feb. 2010).

==Fictional character biography==
First mentioned by a demonic opponent of the maverick [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]],<ref>''Starman (comics)|Starman'' #7-8 (May–June 1995). DC Comics.</ref> Sorrow appears as an unnamed intruder in the prison facility the "Slab", killing two prison guards simply by taking a mask off that reveals his true face. Sorrow then frees the [[supervillain]] the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], telling the criminal that he once saved his father—the first Icicle—when he was forced to flee from the original [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]].<ref>''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999). DC Comics.</ref>

Sorrow reappears as the leader of the new [[Injustice Society]] (consisting of the Icicle, [[Blackbriar Thorn]], [[Count Vertigo]], [[Geomancer (comics)|Geomancer]], [[Killer Wasp]], and the [[Artemis Crock|Tigress]]). Together they storm the headquarters of the [[superhero]] team, the [[Justice Society of America]], although JSA member [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] defeats them all (destroying Blackbriar Thorn) despite still recovering from a broken arm and the attack initially being launched while he was in the bath, with the exception of Sorrow, who uses the diversion to steal an unknown [[magic item|artifact]].<ref>''JSA'' #9 - 10 (April - May 2000). DC Comics.</ref>

Sorrow returns with a larger version of the Injustice Society (having also recruited [[Black Adam]] after removing a brain tumour, [[Shiv (comics)|Shiv]], [[Reverse-Flash|Rival]], and the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]) and finally reveals his origin:

Formerly a [[silent film]] actor, Sorrow was forced into retirement by the new "[[Sound film|talkies]]", and turned to a life of crime. Sorrow stole a "Subspace Prototype" that enabled him to become intangible by warping through another dimension. During an encounter with the Justice Society of America, [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandy the Golden Boy]] destroyed the Subspace Prototype, which unexpectedly tore Sorrow apart and hurled his remains into what Sorrow described as another "fractional dimension" and one of the "Subtle Realms". Sorrow's remains were found by a huge [[Lovecraftian]] entity called the "King of Tears", who revived him and bestowed on the villain a golden mask to contain his new form and allow him to manifest in the material world. Sorrow's face, warped beyond description, was now instantly fatal to all who see it.

Sorrow was returned to Earth on the condition that he find a way to allow the King of Tears to manifest. On his return to Earth, Sorrow killed his wife by accident in his haste to remove his mask so she could see that it was him, and kidnaps Sandy, blaming him for his disfigurement and taking him to a theatre. Newly formed superhero team the "Seven Shadows"—consisting of Dr. Nowhere, Jake Justice, the Shard, Man-At-Arms, Lodestar, the [[Scarab (Vertigo)|Scarab]], and the Veil—attempted to stop Sorrow but, with the exception of the Scarab, they were all killed by Sorrow's gaze. The Scarab requested the aid of the Justice Society, who arrived as the King of Tears was materializing. The entity the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] reduced the monster to actual tears, which were contained and stored by the [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]]. Defeated, Sorrow fled. Later he helped remove a tumour from [[Black Adam]]'s brain, causing him to join Sorrow to repay the debt. Sorrow somehow gained access to the [[Rock of Eternity]] and turns the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] to stone with his gaze. In the present, the Justice Society defeat their evil counterparts in another rematch, but Sorrow then reveals that the artifact he stole was in fact the liquid form of the King of Tears, who materializes once freed. Although the Spectre is summoned to deal with the entity, the King of Tears on this occasion disables the Spectre. The Flash solicits the aid of Black Adam (who has had a change of heart) and uses their combined speed—the Flash borrowing Black Adam's speed by tapping into the [[Speed Force]]—to punch Sorrow just as [[Doctor Mid-Nite (Pieter Cross)|Doctor Mid-Nite]]—his goggles having recorded Sorrow's face when Sorrow tried to attack the blind Mid-Nite earlier but only knocked him out briefly—shows Sorrow his own face, rendering Sorrow solid long enough for Garrick to strike him with such force that it apparently destroys both Sorrow and the King of Tears.<ref>''JSA'' #16 - 20 (Nov. 2000 - March 2001). DC Comics.</ref>

Reforming in an alternate dimension, Sorrow eventually encounters the consciousness of former [[Justice League of America]] villain [[Despero]], and together the pair plan to take revenge on both the JLA and the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]]. After Sorrow turns the [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] to stone with his deadly stare, the pair free the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] from the Rock of Eternity. Despero takes control of [[Lex Luthor]]'s form while seven members of the combined super teams are possessed by the Sins. The heroes are freed from the influence of the Sins by their team mates, and battle Sorrow and Despero, defeating them with teamwork.<ref>''Virtue and Vice'' (Jan. 2002)</ref> Banished once again, Sorrow is retrieved when a new version of the Injustice Society, led by the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]], forms. Sorrow immediately takes control of the group, intent on revenge.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #1 (Feb. 2010)''. DC Comics.</ref>

Sorrow appears in the "[[DC Rebirth]]" series as a former member of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Suicide Squad]], now in a far more secret cell, who is 'recruited' by [[Maxwell Lord]] as part of his plan to destroy Waller.<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> When Lord's team confront Waller, they are confronted by the Squad and the Justice League,<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #3. DC Comics.</ref> but Sorrow helps turn the tables by revealing that he has spent his time in captivity meditating to unleash the monstrous minions of the King of Tears. While Flash and [[Captain Boomerang]] face his monsters, Sorrow is defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Harley Quinn]], Harley's insanity rendering her immune to his gaze while Wonder Woman uses her bracelet to hit Sorrow with his own reflection.<ref>''Justice League VS Suicide Squad'' #4. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Johnny Sorrow was a normal human until an accident with a teleportational device shredded his body and transported his remains to another dimension. An entity called the King of Tears restores Sorrow's consciousness, which now inhabits a floating suit and mask. The character can become solid (and vulnerable) by removing the mask, although this also reveals Sorrow's altered face.

Seeing Sorrow's face is instantly fatal to almost all living creatures, while in other cases it can cause catastrophic madness; there are only two people depicted who've survived gazing upon him. The first is Doctor Mid-Nite who does not perceive Sorrow's face the normal way. There also appears to be a psychological element to the effect of his face, as [[Harley Quinn]] looked at him directly and simply called him cute. In the aftermath, Quinn claimed that she has already gazed into the abyss once, plus she was already insane.

Sorrow himself is apparently also vulnerable to his own gaze, due to a recorded image of his face causing temporary paralysis and the reflection of his face in Wonder Woman's bracelets causing him to 'disperse'. The character can also teleport, [[levitate]], and has vast energy manipulation capabilities as he is able to bend both the physical and mystical energies of any opposing parties at will.

In his most recent appearance, Sorrow has shown to be a leader of his benefactor's legions, as clashing his fists together over his mask calls forth a horde of eldritch demons through flaming portals which serve at his beck and call. If he's otherwise indisposed, his hordes are banished back to the inbetween dimension they hail from. He's also shown to have some minor matter altering abilities as he was able to readjust his mask back to its proper shape after Firestorm morphed it into tar.

==Other versions==
In the pages of ''Earth 2: Society'', the [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]] version of Johnny Sorrow is an ally of [[Jimmy Olsen#Earth 2|Doctor Impossible]].<ref>''Earth 2: Society'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>
