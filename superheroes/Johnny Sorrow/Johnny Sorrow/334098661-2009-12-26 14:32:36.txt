'''Johnny Sorrow''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[publications]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999) and was created by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[David Goyer]] and artist [[Phil Winslade]]. 

[[Debut]]ing in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], the character has appeared in both [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s, and other DC Comics-related products such as [[trading card]]s and [[toy]]s.

== Publication history ==
Johnny Sorrow [[debut]]ed in ''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999), and was, according to writer [[Mike Conroy]], "...a continuity implant. While purportedly a Golden Age villain...around since the 1940's, Sorrow didn't make his first appearance until more than 50 years later."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

After an initial defeat, a greatly changed Sorrow reappeared with a new version of the [[Injustice Society]] in ''[[JSA]]'' #9 - 10 (April - May 2000), and makes a brief appearance in ''Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E'' #13 (Aug. 2000). The character returned in a storyline that detailed the origin of his new powers in ''JSA'' #16 - 20 (Nov. 2000 - March 2001),  and then the [[graphic novel]] ''Virtue and Vice'' (Jan. 2002), battling both the Justice Society and the ''[[JLA]]'' with ally [[Despero]]. Johnny Sorrow and another version of the Injustice Society appeared in ''[[JSA All-Stars]]'' #1 (Feb. 2010).

== Biography ==
Johnny Sorrow first appears as an unnamed intruder in the prison facility the "Slab", killing two prison guards simply by taking a mask off that reveals his true face. Sorrow then frees the [[supervillain]] the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], telling the criminal that he once saved his father - the first Icicle - when he was forced to flee from the original [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]].<ref>''Secret Origins of Super-Villains 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Dec. 1999)</ref> Sorrow reappears as the leader of the new [[Injustice Society]] (consisting of the Icicle; [[Blackbriar Thorn]]; [[Count Vertigo]]; [[Geomancer]]; [[Killer Wasp]] and the [[Artemis Crock|Tigress]]). Together they storm the headquarters of [[superhero]] team  [[Justice Society of America]], although JSA member [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] defeats them all (destroying Blackbriar Thorn), with the exception of Sorrow, who uses the diversion to steal an unknown [[magic item|artefact]].<ref>''JSA'' #9 - 10 (April - May 2000)</ref>

Sorrow returns with a larger version of the Injustice Society (having also recruited [[Black Adam]]; Shiv; Rival and the [[Thinker (comics)|Thinker]]) and finally reveals his origin: formerly a [[silent film]] actor, Sorrow is forced into retirement by the new "[[Sound film|talkies]]," and turns to a life of crime. Sorrow steals a "Subspace Prototype", that enables him to become [[intangible]]. During an encounter with the Justice Society of America, [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandy the Golden Boy]] destroys the Subspace Prototype, which tears Sorrow apart and hurls his remains into what Sorrow another describes as a "fractional dimension" and one of the "Subtle Realms". Sorrow's remains are found by a huge [[Lovecraftian]] entity called the "King of Tears", who revives him and bestows on the villain a golden mask that will contain his new form and allow him to manifest in the material world. Sorrow's face, warped beyond description, is now instantly fatal to all who see it. Sorrow is returned to Earth on the condition he finds a way to allow the King of Tears to manifest. On his return to Earth, Sorrow immediately kills his wife for abandoning him and [[kidnap]]s Sandy, blaming him for his disfigurement and intent on killing him. Sorrow also encounters newly-formed super team the "Seven Shadows" - consisting of Dr. Nowhere; Jake Justice; the Shard; Man-At-Arms; Lodestar; the [[Scarab (Vertigo)|Scarab]] and the Veil - and with the exception of the Scarab kills the heroes with his gaze. The Scarab requests the aid of the Justice Society, who arrive as the King of Tears is materializing. The entity the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], however, reduces the monster to actual tears, which are contained and stored by the [[Jay Garrick|Flash]].

Although the Justice Society defeat the Injustice Socety; Sorrow reveals that the artefact he stole was in fact the liquid form of the King of Tears, who materializes once freed. Although the Spectre is summoned to deal the entity, the King of Tears on this occasion disables the Spectre. The Flash solicits the aid of Black Adam, who has had a change of heart, and uses their combined speed to manipulate the [[Speed Force]], which apparently destroys both Sorrow and the King of Tears.<ref>''JSA'' #16 - 20 (Nov. 2000 - March 2001)</ref>

Reforming in an alternate dimension, Sorrow eventually encounters the consciousness of former [[Justice League of America]] villain [[Despero]], and together the pair plan to take revenge on both the JLA and the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]]. The pair free the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] from the Rock of Eternity, and Sorrow turns the [[wizard]] [[Shazam]] to stone with his deadly stare. Despero takes control of [[Lex Luthor]]'s form while seven members of the combined super teams are possessed by the Sins. The heroes are freed from the influence of the Sins by their team mates, and battle Sorrow and Despero, defeating them with teamwork.<ref>''Virtue and Vice'' (Jan. 2002)</ref> Banished once again, Sorrow is retrieved when a new version of the Injustice Society, led by the [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]], forms. Sorrow immediately takes control of the group, intent on revenge.<ref>''JSA All-Stars'' #1 (Feb. 2010)''</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Johnny Sorrow was a normal human until an accident with a [[teleportation]]al device shredded his body and transported his remains to another dimension. An entity called the King of Tears restores Sorrow's consciousness, which now inhabits a floating suit and mask. The character can become solid (and vulnerable) if removing the mask, although this also reveals Sorrow's altered face. Seeing Sorrow's face is instantly fatal to almost all living creatures. Sorrow himself is apparently also vulnerable to his own gaze, a recorded image of his face causing temporary paralysis. The character can also teleport; [[levitate]] and manipulate energy.

==In other media==
[[HeroClix]] produced a Johnny Sorrow figure as part of the [[Arkham Asylum]] set.
