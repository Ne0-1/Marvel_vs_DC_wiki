'''Wonder Boy''' is the name of two fictional characters who have appeared as [[superhero]]es in comics published by [[Quality Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The original was an alien who appeared in ''[[National Comics]]''. The second was a time-traveler from an alternate future who appeared in ''[[Team Titans]]''.

'''Wonder Boy''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Quality Comics]] character and [[superhero]] who first appeared in ''[[National Comics]]'' #1 (July 1940): "The Boy From the Meteor".  The character lapsed into public domain prior to [[DC Comics]]'s purchase of Quality Comics. 

Wonder Boy was an alien who came from "the depths of outer space" to Earth in the form of a young boy. He decided to use his superhuman abilities to fight the Nazis and crime in general. He had "the strength of a thousand men" and a girlfriend named Sally Benson.

Wonder Boy was last seen in ''National Comics'' #26 (November 1942): "…The long bloody hands of America’s enemies…" and his subsequent whereabouts are unknown.

The second '''Wonder Boy''' debuted in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #19 (April 1994) published by [[DC Comics]]. 

He appeared in the past along with several other Titans from an alternate future. They assisted the Team Titans on a mission, and afterwards the group decided to remain in the past.  Shortly after the mission, [[Donna Troy]] addressed the [[Justice League]] assembly (led by [[Wonder Woman]]) and announced the United States government made a deal to allow the future Titans to remain in the past and act as paranormal operatives led by a government-appointed supervisor.

During his next mission with the Titans, Wonder Boy teamed with [[Aqualad]], [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Mirage (comics)|Mirage]], and other Titans for an undersea mission.<ref>''Team Titans'' #19-22, 24</ref>

During the [[1994]] ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' storyline, the alternate future where the Team Titans originated from is erased from continuity, and all the characters from the alternate future are erased from existence.

In ''Wonder Woman'' #188, writer [[Phil Jiminez]] introduces a character named Bobby Barnes (nephew of Princess Diana's then-love interest Trevor Barnes). In the story, Bobby meets Wonder Woman and follows her for a day. At the end of the story, Wonder Woman presents him with a "Wonder Boy" t-shirt and invites him to [[Themyscira]] for a celebration.
