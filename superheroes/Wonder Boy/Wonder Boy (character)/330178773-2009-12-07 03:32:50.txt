'''Wonder Boy''' is the name of two fictional characters who have appeared as [[superhero]]es in comics published by [[Quality Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The original was an alien who appeared in ''[[National Comics]]''. The second was a time-traveler from an alternate future who appeared in ''[[Team Titans]]''.

==Quality Comics==
'''Wonder Boy''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Quality Comics]] character and [[superhero]] who first appeared in ''[[National Comics (series)|National Comics]]'' #1 (July 1940): "The Boy From the Meteor".  The character lapsed into public domain prior to [[DC Comics]]'s purchase of Quality Comics. 

Wonder Boy was an alien who came from "the depths of outer space" to Earth in the form of a young boy. He decided to use his superhuman abilities to fight the Nazis and crime in general. He had "the strength of a thousand men" and a girlfriend named Sally Benson.

Wonder Boy last appeared under Quality Comics banner in ''National Comics'' #26 (November): "...The long bloody hands of Americaâ€™s enemies..." The character reappeared two years later in Elliot Publishing Co's ''Bomber Comics'' (along with several other characters that originally appeared in ''National Comics''). The circumstances behind the move are unclear. In 1955, he was one of the characters to be used by Ajex-Farrell Comics in ''Terrific Comics'' #16 and ''Wonder Boy'' #17 and 18. The character has not reappeared outside reprints since.

==DC Comics==
===Team Titans===
The second '''Wonder Boy''' debuted in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #19 (April 1994) published by [[DC Comics]]. 

He appeared in the past along with several other Titans from an alternate future. They assisted the Team Titans on a mission, and afterwards the group decided to remain in the past.  Shortly after the mission, [[Donna Troy]] addressed the [[Justice League]] assembly (led by [[Wonder Woman]]) and announced the United States government made a deal to allow the future Titans to remain in the past and act as paranormal operatives led by a government-appointed supervisor.

During his next mission with the Titans, Wonder Boy teamed with [[Aqualad]], [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Mirage (comics)|Mirage]], and other Titans for an undersea mission.<ref>''Team Titans'' #19-22, 24</ref>

During the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' storyline, the alternate future where the Team Titans originated from is erased from continuity, and all the characters from the alternate future are erased from existence.

===Bobby Barnes===
In ''Wonder Woman'' #188, writer [[Phil Jiminez]] introduces a non-super powered character named Bobby Barnes (nephew of Princess Diana's then-love interest Trevor Barnes). In the story, Bobby is a fan of Wonder Woman and follows her around for a day. At the end of the story, Wonder Woman presents him with a "Wonder Boy" t-shirt and invites him to [[Themyscira]] for a celebration.
