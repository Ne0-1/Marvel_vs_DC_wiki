'''Wonder Boy''' is the name of two fictional characters who have appeared as [[superhero]]es in comics published by [[Quality Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The original was an alien who appeared in ''[[National Comics (series)|National Comics]]''. The second was a time-traveler from an alternate future who appeared in ''[[Team Titans]]''.

==Quality Comics==
'''Wonder Boy''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Quality Comics]] character and [[superhero]] who first appeared in ''[[National Comics (series)|National Comics]]'' #1 (July 1940), in the story "The Boy From the Meteor". The character was created by writer [[Toni Blum]] and artist [[John Celardo]].<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/wondrboy.htm Wonder Boy] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]</ref>

With "the strength of a hundred full grown men", the nameless Wonder ''Boy'' fell to Earth from the planet Viro, destroyed when it "collided" with a star. Finding himself in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], he joined forces with Sgt. Crane of the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] and began using his superhuman abilities to fight the [[Nazis]], [[Axis powers|Axis]] spies and big-city crime. Cheering him on from the sidelines was sweetheart Sally Benson, an earth girl.

Wonder Boy last appeared under the Quality Comics banner in ''National Comics'' #26 (Nov. 1942), in an untitled story beginning "...The long bloody hands of America's enemies..." The character reappeared two years later in Elliot Publishing Co's ''Bomber Comics'' (along with several other characters that originally appeared in ''National Comics''). The circumstances behind the move are unclear. In 1955, he was one of the characters to be used by [[Ajax-Farrell Publications|Ajax-Farrell Comics]] in ''Terrific Comics'' #16 and ''Wonder Boy'' #17 and 18.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terrific Comics (Ajax)|url=http://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/titledetail.aspx?TitleID=14141|work=AtomicAvenue.com|accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref>  The character has not reappeared outside reprints since.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/wonder%20boy/sort/chrono/ Wonder Boy] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> Another refugee from the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] to turn up in ''Wonder Boy'' #17 was [[Phantom Lady]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Phantom Lady in Wonder Boy #17 grabbed, tied up|url=http://www.sleepycomics.com/show.php?id=5748|work=Sleepy Comics|accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref>

==DC Comics==
===Team Titans===
The second '''Wonder Boy''' debuted in ''[[Team Titans]]'' #19 (April 1994) published by [[DC Comics]]. He appeared in the past along with several other Titans from an alternate future. They assisted the Team Titans on a mission, and afterwards the group decided to remain in the past.  Shortly after the mission, [[Donna Troy]] addressed the [[Justice League]] assembly (led by [[Wonder Woman]]) and announced the United States government made a deal to allow the future Titans to remain in the past and act as paranormal operatives led by a government-appointed supervisor. During his next mission with the Titans, Wonder Boy teamed with [[Aqualad]], [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Mirage (comics)|Mirage]], and other Titans for an undersea mission.<ref>''Team Titans'' #19-22, 24</ref>

During the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' storyline, the alternate future where the Team Titans originated from is erased from continuity, and all the characters from the alternate future are erased from existence.

===Bobby Barnes===
In ''Wonder Woman'' #188, writer [[Phil Jiminez]] introduces a non-super powered character named Bobby Barnes (nephew of Princess Diana's then-love interest Trevor Barnes). In the story, Bobby is a fan of Wonder Woman and follows her around for a day. At the end of the story, Wonder Woman presents him with a "Wonder Boy" t-shirt and invites him to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] for a celebration.
