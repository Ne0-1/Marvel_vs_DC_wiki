'''Cerise''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Cerise is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] from the planet Shaskofrugnon in the Shi'ar Empire. She was accidentally transported to Earth after deserting the empire's brutal army, the Ghrand Jhar, refusing to fire upon innocents and as a result causing the death of her crew.  She became a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] upon encountering them,<ref>''Excalibur'' #46-47</ref> and later became romantically involved with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].

Alongside Excalibur, she battled the [[Anti-Phoenix]]'s rock creatures.<ref>''Excalibur'' #48</ref> She also fought [[Necrom]] alongside Excalibur.<ref>''Excalibur'' #49-50</ref> She later encountered the [[Crazy Gang (Marvel Comics)|Crazy Gang]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #54</ref> Alongside Excalibur, she was struck down by [[Jamie Braddock]] and [[Sat-Yr-9]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #55-56</ref> She next aided Excalibur and the [[X-Men]] against [[Troll Associates]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #57-58</ref> Cerise and Nightcrawler then encountered the [[Knight Errant (comics)|Knight Errant]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #59-60</ref> She was then attacked by the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and captured by [[Nigel Orpington-Smythe]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #62</ref> She then met [[Khaos (comics)|Khaos]], and alongside Khaos and Excalibur she battled his foe Ghath on their planet Irth, and invited Khaos to join Excalibur.<ref>''Excalibur Annual'' #1</ref> 

During the Warpies Saga, wherein superhuman children were being manipulated, Cerise was baffled with the concept of "children". Shadowcat tried to explain to her how infants are born and grows up to become adults. But Cerise reveals that she "emerged from the source" as she is, hinting that she may have been engineered rather than born.<ref>''Excalibur'' #63</ref> As she has revealed in her first appearance, she is the gene stock of Subruki, Zarstock, and Kuli Ka.

Eventually, Cerise was taken into custody by the [[Starjammers]] for her crimes against the Shi'ar Empire.<ref>''Excalibur'' #68</ref> She was sent to the pan-dimensional prison Krag, where she was revealed to have destroyed the Shi'ar recruitment vehicle (Ghrand Jhar) to prevent it from carrying out further acts of genocide.<ref>''Excalibur'' #69</ref> She was forced to kill the second [[Fang (Imperial Guard)|Fang]] in personal combat. The Shi'ar empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] pardoned Cerise for her crimes, given their circumstances, and allowed her to serve out her prison sentence as a personal aide. Cerise's role in the Shi'ar Empire is to investigate reports of brutality and violence among Shi'ar officials.<ref>''Excalibur'' #70</ref> 

During 2000's "Maximum Security" crossover, Nightcrawler professed at one point that he still loves her, but at the time he was planning to become a priest, and thus could not rekindle their relationship.<ref>''X-Men 107'' (2000)</ref>

===Annihilation===
Cerise appeared in [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] as a member of the Graces, a group of female warriors, led by [[Gamora]].<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #2-4 (2006)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Cerise is a member of the alien Shi'ar race, making her physical abilities somewhat more powerful than an Earth human.  

She also has the ability to generate and psionically manipulate energy fields of coherent red spectrum light force. She can project the light as simple brightness, or as concussive blasts, or use it to form "solid" objects such as swords, force fields, shields, funnels, and more. She was even able to make a light armor covering Nightcrawler as he trained with Captain Britain.<ref>''Excalibur'' #61</ref>  Cerise can create a bubble of coherent light around herself which she can levitate through the air. She once even used this energy to fly a whole broken [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] holding her friends within, across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as a means of disguise. She can also fly naturally (without use of her energy fields), and hold her breath for six or seven minutes. 

Cerise wears gloves that contain broad-band sensor arrays which allow her to search for specific life-forms, energy, and temporal/dimensional abnormalities in a surrounding area. She also wore a "transit suit" permitting travel through hyperspace. Her equipment was designed by Shi'ar scientists and craftsmen.

Cerise is a superb warrior, having received intensive combat training in the Shi'ar military, and is a trained starship navigator.

==Other versions==
In ''[[X-Men: The End]]'',  Cerise is an undercover member of the Imperial Guard, but accidentally thwarts the plans of Empress Lilandra.{{issue|date=June 2013}}  She is then betrayed and killed by Sinister's Marauders.{{issue|date=June 2013}}
