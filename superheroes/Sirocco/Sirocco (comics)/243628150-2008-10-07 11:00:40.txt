'''Sirocco''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''New Mutants Annual #7''.

==Fictional character biography==
Sirocco was part of the [[Iraqi]] mercenary team called [[Desert Sword]] when they fought [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], led by [[Crimson Commando]]. Desert Sword was to prevent Freedom Force from liberating a [[Germans|German]] scientist named Reinhold Kurtzmann in [[Kuwait]]. Desert Sword ambushed them and Aminedi decapitated [[Super Sabre]] and cut off Crimson Commando's right arm. Kurtzmann was captured by Freedom force but then recaptured by Desert Sword. [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] still managed to kill Kurtzmann though. Sirocco and [[Aminedi]] trapped [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and Commando in a mine field and as Commando's condition worsened Avalanche trapped the two under a pile of rock, though they later escaped, and rode a wave of dirt to their designated extraction point and got him to safety, leaving both [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] and Pyro who were later captured by Desert Sword.

It is unknown if Sirocco retained his powers after [[M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities==
Sirocco can warp nearby weather patterns to create swirling air funnels that can strike with concussive impact or lift him into the air.
