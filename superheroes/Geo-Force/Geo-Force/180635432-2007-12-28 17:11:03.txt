'''Geo-Force''' is the [[superhero]] alias of '''Brion Markov''', a [[fictional character]] from [[DC Comics]]. Markov is Prince of [[Markovia (comics)|Markovia]] and the half-brother of [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]. Geo-Force is one of the founding members of the superhero group [[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' # 200 (July 1983). The character was created by [[Mike W. Barr]] and [[Jim Aparo]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Batman and the Outsiders===
Dr. Helga Jace uses a device to give Prince Brion Markov superpowers with which he could stop an insurrection mounted by the evil [[Baron Bedlam]]. At this time, five other superheroes converge in Markovia for various reasons of their own. Veteran heroes [[Batman]], [[Metamorpho]], and [[Black Lightning]] join forces with Geo-Force and two other new heroes, [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Halo (comics)|Halo]]. After stopping the insurrection, the heroes decide to stay together as [[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]], with Batman (who has resigned from the [[JLA]]) as team leader.

In one of their earliest missions, the Outsiders team up with the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], who were led at the time by Batman's sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].  It was during this adventure that Geo-Force was reunited with his half-sister Tara Markov, also known as [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] of the Titans. Tara was the product of an affair King Markov (Brion's father) had with an unnamed American woman. Fearing scandal, the king sent Tara to be raised in the United States. Unbeknownst to Geo-Force and her fellow Titans, Terra is secretly a spy working for [[Deathstroke]].  

In the climatic battle between the Titans and Deathstroke, Terra works herself into a frenzy, with her earth manipulation power seemingly going out of control. When the dust settled, Tara Markov was dead. At first, the Titans did not tell Geo-Force of her betrayal, letting him think that she died a hero. At a later date, however, Batman reveals the truth to Geo-Force, which left him even more heartbroken than before. In his depression, Geo-Force could not bring himself to continue wearing his "earthtone" costume, as it reminded him of Tara, who wore a similar uniform. His teammates presented him with a new green and gold costume to lift his spirits. It works well, and Geo-Force has worn those colors ever since. The colors have dual importance to Geo-Force as both the colors of his native Markovia's flag, and symbolically representing the Earth, from which his powers are derived (green), while reminding him how precious his gifts truly are (gold).

===The Outsiders===
After the Outsiders split with [[Batman]], they are privately funded by Markovia. During this time, Geo-Force is the unofficial new leader of the team. However, this information eventually comes out and [[Major Disaster]] destroys their base.

Around this time, the sovereignty of Markovia again comes under threat. Investigating the mysterious new Prime Minister, Geo-Force leads a team of Outsiders and [[Infinity Inc.]] members back to his homeland. Having grown up in the main castle, it is easy for Geo-Force to lead the team in. He soon discovers that the [[Psycho-Pirate]], in the disguise of long term Outsiders enemy, Baron Bedlam, is attempting to conquer the country. 

The United States government withdraws any foreign aid from Markovia until that nation releases the true names of the Outsiders. Before King Gregor, Brion's older brother could make a decision, he is murdered. Brion becomes king, but he is forced to abdicate and was imprisoned when his sister-in-law, Iona (Gregor's wife), reveals she is pregnant. His teammate [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] reveals to Brion that the murderer of his brother is Dr. Jace. She has betrayed the team for the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]], because she admires their dedication to knowledge. The battle concludes with the death of Jace and her unwilling slave [[Metamorpho]]. The Outsiders disband.

The second incarnation of the Outsiders was born when, appropriately enough, a number of heroes again met up in Markovia. Former Outsiders Geo-Force, Katana, Halo and Looker are joined by new heroes [[Sebastian Faust|Faust]], [[Technocrat (comics)|Technocrat]] and [[Wylde (comics)|Wylde]]. The latter two were on hand to sell a new battlesuit to Markovia. Queen Iona has teamed up with Roderick, a vampire, in order to kill Geo-Force, though the first attempt made it seem as if Technocrat was under attack. Using a vampire's inabillity to be recorded, Roderick frames Geo-Force for Iona's on-air murder.

Geo-Force and the Outsiders go on the run for some time, hiding out mostly in America. They eventually clear their names and destroy Roderick and his vampric legions.

During this time, another Terra has appeared, seemingly tossed from time, along with a group known as the [[Team Titans]]. Geo-Force's first attempt to talk to her meets with failure when he accidentally gets swept up in a rock column she has created during a loud party. He finds her again at the Titans headquarters. After a brief fight with her friends, he manages to sit down with her. The new Terra convinces him she is not her sister. Unfortunately, rogue Markovian scientists attack with the intention of forcibly duplicating Terra's powers. Geo-Force and the other Titans rescue her.

Further revelations revealed that this Terra was in fact from their time, and that the 'original' Terra's body is missing from her coffin.

Brion invites Terra to live in Markovia, which she accepts, as her group of Titans were disbanding. In Markovia, scienctists conduct a [[DNA testing|DNA test]] to discover if Terra was in fact the original Terra. She herself was in fear of the results, afraid that she might in fact be a villainous traitor. Although Brion mercifully told her the results were negative, they were in fact positive, and he remains the only person to have this knowledge.

Around this time, as part of the [[Day of Judgement (comics)|Day of Judgement]] incident, a portal to hell threatens to swallow the country of Markovia. A small team of Outsiders, including the newer Terra, are on hand to help combat it.

Brion soon marries his long-time girlfriend, Denise Howard, and currently serves as regent of Markovia until his nephew is of age.

Geo-Force briefly appears in "[[52 (comic book)|52]]" #35, assisting Metropolis citizens injured in a mass-murder incident caused by [[Lex Luthor]].

===Justice League of America===
Geo-Force has appeared in recent issues of the new [[Justice League of America]] series. After several unexplained incidents in his homeland, including the destruction of his pleasure yacht and frequent blackouts, he realizes he has somehow duplicated Terra's powers. He asks the JLA for help. He saves the life of [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] when a training exercise went very wrong. In issue #12 of Justice League of America it is revealed that it was actually Vixen (whose powers have been malfunctioning lately) that triggers Brion's Null Gravity powers in order to save Red Arrow.  

Brion's sister dies at the hands of a grief-maddened [[Black Adam]].

In "Batman And The Outsiders" #3 (second volume), Geo-Force is "transferred" from the Justice League of America to the new incarnation of the Outsiders, evidently as part of deal worked out between Batman and [[Black Canary]].  At first angry about his teammates going behind his back, Brion is happy with the move in the end.  

==Powers and abilities==
*The code name "Geo-Force" comes from the fact that Brion has the same "superpowers" as the earth itself. As the earth has a gravitational field, Geo-Force can manipulate gravity to make an object heavier ("plus-gravity") or lighter ("null-gravity"). As the earth can produce scorching [[lava]], Geo-Force can generate his own "lava blasts" of intense heat. By using his null-gravity power on himself coupled with lava blasts for propulsion, Geo-Force can fly at great speeds for short periods of time. (His teammate Black Lightning once remarked that Geo-Force weakens after flying 1,000 miles.) Geo-Force has the powers of earth and gravity control.
*Geo-Force also possesses impressive super strength. Geo-Force is also shown to possess a superhuman level of durability/invulnerability. When he was shot in the back by the [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of Baron Bedlam, the bullets staggered him, but they did not puncture his skin, albeit recently his durability was greatly diminished.
*Geo-Force gained his powers due in part to his heritage as a prince of Markovia, and the effects of the device designed for manifesting said powers. Only one with royal Markov blood can retain the geo-force powers permanently. The source of Geo-Force's powers is the Earth itself. During his first adventure, Geo-Force was apparently killed, and he was buried by soldiers. The Earth nurtured Geo-Force, healing his wounds and essentially "recharged" him. While Geo-Force is at his strongest when he is firmly on solid earth ground, his powers and health will deteriorate if he is taken off earth for a long period of time. In such instances, Geo-Force will die unless he returns to earth in time.
*Geo-Force also has the powers of Terra, apparently kicking in when wounded or in dire situations.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=July 2007}}
*Geo-Force has consistently been portrayed as a hothead who often lets his temper get the best of him.
*Geo-Force's [[catchphrase]] is "By my crown!". He frequently shouts this to express surprise and/or outrage. Of course, it is also a reference to the fact that he is prince of Markovia.  
*Geo-Force has killed villains, including Roderick and a clone of Baron Bedlam.
*It was not unusual for Geo-Force to get involved with a teammate. Prior to dating Denise, Geo-Force and Halo shared a brief courtship. Later, when the team found themselves stranded on an island, Geo-Force had a [[one night stand]] with Looker (who was married). Both felt remorse and vowed to stay "just friends."
