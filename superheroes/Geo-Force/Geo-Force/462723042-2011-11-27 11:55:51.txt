==Fictional character biography==
===Batman and the Outsiders===
Dr. Helga Jace used a device to give Prince Brion Markov superpowers with which he could stop an insurrection mounted by the evil [[Baron Bedlam]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> At this time, five other superheroes converged in Markovia for various reasons of their own. Veteran heroes [[Batman]], [[Metamorpho]], and [[Black Lightning]] joined forces with Geo-Force and two other new heroes, [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Halo (comics)|Halo]]. After stopping the insurrection, the heroes decided to stay together as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], with Batman (who had resigned from the [[Justice League|JLA]]) as team leader.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Brion got along with his teammates, though he occasionally butted heads with Batman and his teammates due to his short-tempered personality. When he was not active as a superhero, Brion attended college in the US and began dating fellow classmate Denise Howard.

In one of their earliest missions, the Outsiders teamed up with the [[Teen Titans]], who were led at the time by Batman's sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. It was revealed that Geo-Force was the brother of Tara Markov, also known as [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] of the Titans.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Tara was the product of an affair King Markov (Brion's father) had with an unnamed American woman. Fearing scandal, the king sent Tara to be raised in the United States. Unbeknownst to Geo-Force and her fellow Titans, Terra was secretly a spy working for [[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. Brion was happy to be reunited with his half-sister, though Terra was less happy due to fears that Brion would say the wrong thing and possibly expose the fictional backstory she told the Titans about herself and how she gained her powers.

Several weeks later, Terra would betray the Titans to Deathstroke. In the climactic battle between the Titans and Deathstroke and Terra, Terra's sociopathic personality broke down as she tried to kill both the Titans and Deathstroke, when Deathstroke's son, [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph]], intervened on behalf of the Titans to stop his father. In the end, Terra accidentally killed herself when she tried to bury the Titans alive in a massive rock storm. At first, the Titans did not tell Geo-Force of her betrayal, letting him think that she died a hero. At a later date, however, Batman revealed the truth to Geo-Force, which left him even more heartbroken than before. In his depression, Geo-Force could not bring himself to continue wearing his "earthtone" costume, as it reminded him of Tara, who wore a similar uniform. Designed and suggested by Batman, a new green and gold costume was presented to Brion by his teammates to lift his spirits. It worked well, and Geo-Force wore those colors for most of his career. The colors had dual importance to Geo-Force as both the colors of his native Markovia's flag, and symbolically representing the Earth, from which his powers are derived (green), while reminding him how precious his gifts truly are (gold). By the time he joined the [[Justice League]], however, Geo-Force had returned to another version of his old "earthtone" uniform.

===The Outsiders===
After the Outsiders split with [[Batman]], they were privately funded by Markovia. During this time, Geo-Force was the unofficial new leader of the team. However, this information eventually came out and [[Major Disaster]] destroyed their base.

Around this time, the sovereignty of Markovia again came under threat. Investigating the mysterious new Prime Minister, Geo-Force led a team of Outsiders and [[Infinity Inc.]] members back to his homeland. Having grown up in the main castle, it was easy for Geo-Force to lead the team in. He soon discovered that the [[Psycho-Pirate]] in the disguise of long term Outsiders enemy Baron Bedlam was attempting to conquer the country. The two teams joined forces to stop Psycho-Pirate and left on good terms.

Brion meanwhile would have a one-night stand with Looker when the team was stranded on a desert island. The move would strain the relationship between Brion and his girlfriend Denise as well as Looker's relationship with her husband. Brion and Looker agreed to remain platonic friends afterward.

The United States government withdrew any foreign aid from Markovia until that nation released the true names of the Outsiders. Before King Gregor, Brion's older brother, could make a decision, he was murdered. Brion became king, but he was forced to abdicate and was imprisoned when his sister-in-law, Iona (Gregor's wife), revealed she is pregnant. His teammate [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] revealed to Brion that the murderer of his brother was the team's trusted friend and scientist associate, Dr. Jace. Jace had betrayed the team for the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]], because she admired their dedication to knowledge. In the end, Jace would die along with a mind-controlled [[Metamorpho]]. This, along with a second battle with the descendants of teammate Looker which resulted in Looker being temporarily stripped of her powers and Halo left injured and comatose, caused the Outsiders to disband and Brion to retire as Geo-Force.

In the early 1990s, however, the Outsiders would be revived with former Outsiders Geo-Force, Katana, Halo, and Looker joined by new heroes [[Sebastian Faust|Faust]], [[Technocrat (comics)|Technocrat]], and [[Wylde (comics)|Wylde]]. The latter two were on hand to sell a new battlesuit to Markovia. Queen Iona has teamed up with Roderick, a vampire, in order to kill Geo-Force, though the first attempt made it seem as if Technocrat was under attack. Using a vampire's inability to be recorded, Roderick frames Geo-Force for Iona's on-air murder, forcing the team on the run.

Geo-Force and the Outsiders went on the run for some time, hiding out mostly in America. They eventually cleared their names and destroyed Roderick and his vampric legions. At the end of the second ''Outsiders'' series, Brion married his long-time girlfriend, Denise Howard.

[[Image:Terraresults.jpg|273px|thumb|right|Brion and the new Terra awaiting the results.]]
During this time, another Terra had appeared as part of a group known as the [[Team Titans]], who appear to have come from the future. This new Terra claims to have been a normal girl who was given Terra's appearance and powers as a result of a DNA virus. Geo-Force's first attempt to talk to her meets with failure when he accidentally got swept up in a rock column she has created during a loud party. He found her again at the Titans headquarters. After a brief fight with her friends, he managed to sit down with her. The new Terra convinced him she is not his sister. Unfortunately, rogue Markovian scientists attacked with the intention of forcibly duplicating Terra's powers. Geo-Force and the other Titans rescued her. Further revelations implied that this Terra was in fact from their time, when the original Terra's grave was dug up and her corpse was missing from her coffin.

Brion invited Terra to live in Markovia, which she accepted, as her group of Titans was disbanding. In Markovia, scientists conducted a [[DNA testing|DNA test]] in hope of discovering if Terra was in fact Geo-Force's sister. Terra herself was in fear of the results, afraid that she might in fact be a villainous traitor. When the test results came back positive, Brion lied to Terra telling her that the results were negative, in order to spare her further stress due to the inconclusive results.

Around this time, as part of the [[Day of Judgement (comics)|Day of Judgement]] incident, a portal to hell threatened to swallow the country of Markovia. A small team of Outsiders, including the newer Terra, Katana, and the original Halo were on hand to help combat it.

Geo-Force briefly appears in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #35, assisting Metropolis citizens injured in a mass-murder incident caused by [[Lex Luthor]]. He later was a part of the army of heroes gathered by the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] at the end of ''52'' to battle [[Black Adam]], who in his global killing spree after the death of his wife and brother-in-law, had murdered Terra II. Before the battle, Geo-Force told [[Beast Boy]] not to blame himself for Terra II's death.

===Justice League of America===
While sailing in his yacht off the coast of Greece, Geo-Force suddenly found himself losing control over his powers, which had suddenly changed to include his sister's earth manipulation powers. This sudden increase in power, which caused Geo-Force to black out, was ultimately caused by the villainous Deathstroke the Terminator through as of yet unrevealed means.

Geo-Force sought help from the newly reformed [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], becoming an unofficial member of the group. This would ultimately be revealed to be Deathstroke's overall plan, as he ultimately confronted Geo-Force in order to blackmail him into becoming a spy, just like Terra, in exchange for Deathstroke promising one day to remove the added powers he forced upon Geo-Force. Unfortunately for Deathstroke however, Geo-Force informed Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman of Deathstroke's scheme and agreed to become a double-agent: spying on Deathstroke for the League while spying on the League for Deathstroke.

Unfortunately, the scheme fell apart when [[Lex Luthor]] organized a new incarnation of the Injustice League and captured the Justice League. While a prisoner, Geo-Force was brutally tortured alongside Red Tornado, at the hands of [[Gorilla Grodd]]. While recovering from his injuries, Geo-Force is "traded" to Batman's latest incarnation of "The Outsiders" much to Geo-Force's dismay and ultimately, acceptance.

In ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament'', Geo-Force confronts Deathstroke in a battle. After contemplating murder he is persuaded otherwise by Black Lightning and [[Rocky Davis]] of the [[Challengers of the Unknown]]. He loses a lot of blood to Deathstroke in their fight, however he set their confrontation at the same alley/building complex where Deathstroke's second son Jericho was kidnapped to. Slashing his own throat in the same manner his son was cut lets Deathstroke's guard down, allowing Brion to impale Slade with his own sword and through his own body. Believing he has defeated Slade, while sacrificing his own life, he is surprised to wake up in the hospital. It is thought that he single handedly took down Deathstroke, but no one knows that Geo-Force was trying to commit suicide. Geo-Force becomes the field leader of the Outsiders and is seen to still be secretly living with the shame of his actions.

===Blackest Night===

Geo-Force turned Terra into a statue and her ring is destroyed by [[Halo (comics)|Halo]].<ref>''Outsiders'' vol. 4, #25</ref>

===Marriage/Divorce===
{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}
Geo-Force later married his long time girlfriend, Denise Howard.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} However, since she was not a Markovian, the marriage was annulled by Brion's choice.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} Unbeknownst to Brion, Denise later tried to undergo the experiment that give Geo-Force his powers, but because she did not have Markovian blood in her, she gained the same powers but with a changed appearance and with loss of sanity.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} She was locked up, but escaped recently to take revenge on Markovia by killing several innocent Markovians.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} At this time, Geo-Force is proclaiming his affections for Katana but before she could answer Geo's declaration of love, they are interrupted by Eradicator.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} Eradicator informs Brion of Geode's escape and her recent attack on Markovia.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}
  
Geo-Force and Eradicator go to intercept Geode.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} The battle with Brion's deranged wife seemed one sided as Geode smacked both heroes around like ragdolls.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} Eradicator pleaded with Geo-Force to use his powers to subdue Geode but Brion was conflicted with the idea of striking his wife.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} With Geo-Force unable to take the intiative, Eradicator decided to unleash the full extent of his power to knock Geode unconscious.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
As implied by his codename, all of Brion's powers are in some way related to the planet Earth. He can manipulate the Earth's gravitational field to make an object heavier ("plus-gravity") or lighter ("null-gravity"). He can also project scorching "lava blasts" in imitation of terrestrial volcanoes. By using his null-gravity power on himself coupled with lava blasts for propulsion, Geo-Force can fly at great speeds for short periods of time (his teammate Black Lightning once remarked that Geo-Force weakens after flying 1,000 miles). Geo-Force has also demonstrated the ability to manipulate the Earth itself, in a manner similar to [[Terra (comics)|Terra]].{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Geo-force has also been shown to have the ability to turn organic material to stone. This ability is not quite explained in the one instance he has turned the reanimated corpse of Terra to stone.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Geo-Force also possesses impressive superhuman strength and durability. When he was shot in the back by the [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of Baron Bedlam, the bullets staggered him, but they did not puncture his skin{{Issue|date=January 2010}}. With the addition to Terra's powers to his own, his durability seems diminished. He can now be at least slashed by sharp items,<ref>''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament''</ref> but usually deep wounds trigger an increase in his powers leading to earth-manipulation powers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Geo-Force gained his powers due in part to his heritage as a prince of Markovia, and the effects of the device designed for manifesting said powers. Only one with royal Markov blood can retain these powers permanently. The source of Geo-Force's powers is the Earth itself. During his first adventure, Geo-Force was apparently killed and buried by enemy soldiers. The Earth nurtured Geo-Force, healing his wounds and essentially "recharging" him.<ref>''Batman And The Outsiders'' #1-2 (August/September 1983)</ref>

Geo-Force is at his strongest when he is firmly planted on the ground; his powers and health will deteriorate if he is taken off of the Earth for a long period of time. In such instances, Geo-Force will die unless he returns to Earth in time.<ref>''Outsiders'' vol. 2, #24</ref>

==Other versions==
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Brion Markov is the king of Markovia. At some point he was contacted by [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] while trying to make an alliance with the Atlanteans due to the Amazonian Invasion of the [[UK]], and later captured by [[Aquaman]] who attached the young king to a machine constructed by Vulko in order to amplify Brion's powers of manipulation of the Earth's gravitational field. It was through Brion that Aquaman managed to cause Western Europe to sink into the sea.<ref>''Flashpoint: Emperor Aquaman'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Geo-Force appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!" voiced by [[Hunter Parrish]]. He is shown as one of the latest members of the Outsiders when they help Batman fight [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]].
