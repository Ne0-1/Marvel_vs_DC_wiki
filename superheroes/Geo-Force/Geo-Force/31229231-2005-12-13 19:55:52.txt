[[Geo-Force]] is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]].  Geo-Force was created by writer [[Mike W. Barr]] and artist [[Jim Aparo]].  His first appearance was in ''The Brave And The Bold #200'' (July, 1983).  Geo-Force (a.k.a. Prince Brion Markov of Markovia) is one of the founding members of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and the half-brother of [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]. 

==History==
Dr. Helga Jace used a device to give Prince Brion Markov superpowers with which he could stop an insurrection mounted by the evil Baron Bedlam.  At this time, five other superheroes converged in Markovia for various reasons of their own.  Veteran heroes [[Batman]], [[Metamorpho]], and [[Black Lightning]] joined forces with Geo-Force and two other new heroes,  [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Halo (comics)|Halo]].  After stopping the insurrection, the heroes decided to stay together as [[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]], with Batman (who had resigned from the [[JLA]]) as team leader.

In one of their earliest missions, the Outsiders teamed up with the [[Teen Titans]], who were led at the time by Batman's sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].  It was during this adventure that Geo-Force first met his half-sister Tara Markov, a.k.a. [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] of the Titans.  Tara was the product of an affair King Markov (Brion's father) had with an unnamed American woman.  Fearing scandal, the king sent Tara to be raised in the United States.  Unbeknownst to Geo-Force and her fellow Titans, Terra was secretly a spy working for [[Deathstroke]].  In the climatic battle between the Titans and Deathstroke, Terra worked herself into a frenzy, with her [[-kinesis#Terrakinesis|terrakinetic]] power seemingly going out of control.  When the dust settled, Tara Markov was dead.  At first, the Titans did not tell Geo-Force of her betrayal, letting him think that she died a hero.  At a later date, however, Batman told Geo-Force the truth about his sister, which left him even more heartbroken than before.  In his depression, Geo-Force couldn't bring himself to continue wearing his "earthtone" costume, for it reminded him of Tara, who wore a similar uniform.  His teammates presented him with a new green and gold costume to lift his spirits.  It worked well, and Geo-Force has worn those colors ever since.

After the Outsiders split with [[Batman]], they were privately funded by Markovia. During this time, Geo-Force was the unofficial new leader of the team.  However, the secret eventually came out and [[Major Disaster]] destroyed their base. The United States government withdrew any foreign aid from Markovia until that nation released the true names of the Outsiders. Before King Gregor (Brion's older brother) could take a decision, he was murdered. Brion became king, but he was forced to abdicate and was imprisoned when his sister-in-law, Iona (Gregor's wife), revealed she was pregnant. His teammate Looker revealed to Brion that the murderer of his brother was Dr. Jace, who was in fact working for the [[Manhunters]]. After fighting the Manhunters, the Outsiders disbanded and went their separate ways. 

The second incarnation of the Outsiders was born when, appropriately enough, a number of heroes again met up in Markovia.  Former Outsiders Geo-Force, Katana, Halo, and [[Looker (comics)/Temp|Looker]] were joined by new heroes [[Faust (comics)|Faust]], [[Technocrat]], and [[Wylde]].  Roderick, an evil vampire, killed Queen Iona and framed Geo-Force for her murder.  Geo-Force and the other Outsiders were wanted fugitives until they managed to clear their names and vanquish Roderick.

Brion married his long-time girlfriend, Denise Howard, and currently serves as regent of Markovia until his nephew is of age.

==Characteristics==
Geo-Force has consistently been portrayed as a hothead who often lets his temper get the best of him.

Geo-Force's [[catchphrase]] is "By my crown!"  He frequently shouts this to express surprise and/or outrage.  Of course, it's a reference to the fact that he is prince of Markovia.  You wouldn't think that such an exclamation would be conducive to his secret identity.

Geo-Force has killed villains.  Roderick and a clone of Baron Bedlam come to mind.

It was not unusual for Geo-Force to get involved with a teammate.  Prior to dating Denise, Geo-Force and Halo shared a brief courtship.  Later, when the team found themselves stranded on an island, Geo-Force had a one night stand with Looker (who was married).  Both felt remorse and vowed to stay "just friends."

==Powers & Abilities==
The code name "Geo-Force" comes from the fact that Brion has the same "superpowers" as the earth itself.  As the earth has a gravitational field, Geo-Force can manipulate gravity to make an object heavier ("plus-gravity") or lighter ("null-gravity").  As the earth can produce scorching lava, Geo-Force can generate his own "lava blasts" of intense heat.  By using his null-gravity power on himself coupled with lava blasts for propulsion, Geo-Force can fly at great speeds for short periods of time.  (His teammate Black Lightning once remarked that Geo-Force weakens after flying 1,000 miles.)

Geo-Force also possesses impressive super strength on a level with DC's heavy hitters.  Geo-Force once fought Superman toe-to-toe by using his gravity power to augment his already-formidable strength.  In the Elseworlds tale ''JLA: The Nail'', Black Canary said Geo-Force was the strongest man on earth (Superman had yet to surface).  Geo-Force is also shown to possess a superhuman level of durability/invulnerability.  When he was shot in the back by the clone of Baron Bedlam, the bullets staggered him, but did not break his skin.

Geo-Force gained his powers due in part to his heritage as a prince of Markovia, and the effects of the device designed for manifesting said powers.  Only one with royal Markov blood can retain the geo-force powers permanently.  The source of Geo-Force's powers is the earth itself.  During his first adventure, Geo-Force was apparently killed, and buried by soldiers.  The earth nurtured Geo-Force, healing his wounds and essentially, "recharging" him.  While Geo-Force is at his strongest when he is firmly on solid earth ground, his powers and health will deteriorate if he is taken off earth for a long period of time.  In such instances, Geo-Force will die unless he returns to earth in time.
