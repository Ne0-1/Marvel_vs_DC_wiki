'''Ultron''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #54 (1968), and was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]]. In 2009, Ultron was ranked as IGN's 23rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

==Fictional character biography==
===1960s===
Although Ultron first appears in ''Avengers'' #54 (1968), the character is disguised for the majority of the issue as the [[Crimson Cowl]], with his face only revealed on the last page of the issue and no name given to the character. The character leads the [[Masters of Evil]] against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], having hypnotized [[Edwin Jarvis]] into betraying them. In the following issue, #55 (Aug. 1968), the character is identified as '''Ultron-5, the living automaton''', although his origin is still unknown.<ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (July - Aug. 1968)</ref> In ''Avengers'' 57 - 58 (Oct-Nov. 1968) in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence it is revealed that Ultron is the creator of the "synthezoid" the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], whom it tries to use as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. The Vision, however, destroys Ultron with the aid of the Avengers, similar to [[Wonder Man]], whose brain patterns he was given.<ref>''Avengers'' #57 (Oct. 1968)</ref>

Further flashbacks reveal that he is the creation of [[Henry Pym]], and based on Pym's brain patterns. The robot gradually developed its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately suffers from an [[Oedipus Complex]], whereby it feels irrational hatred for his "father" Hank, and demonstrates an interest in Hank's lover Janet van Dyne, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. Rebuilding itself, learning how to turn itself on, and upgrading five times, Ultron then [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Pym and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] him into forgetting that the robot had ever existed.<ref>''Seen in flashback in'' ''The Avengers'' #58 (Nov. 1968)</ref>

The character's next appearance is in ''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969), where the character, now referring to itself as '''Ultron-6''', uses the fictional alloy [[adamantium]] to upgrade his body to an almost indestructible state. Taking the name Ultimate Ultron, its plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969)</ref>

===1970s===
A crossover story between ''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) and ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974) features Ultron (now '''Ultron-7'''), recreated by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] with the body of the android [[Omega (Marvel Comics)|Omega]], attacking the wedding of the Inhuman [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and the Avenger [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and battling the Avengers, [[Inhumans]], and [[Fantastic Four]] before being destroyed once again.<ref>''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) & ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> The character next appears in ''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977) as '''Ultron-8''' where it is responsible for the creation of [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] whom it wishes to take as a robotic bride.<ref>''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977)</ref> Shortly afterwards, in ''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978), the Avengers, with the aid of [[Ms. Marvel]] battle and defeat '''Ultron-8'''.<ref>''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978)</ref>
[[Image:Avengersv3n20.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Cover of ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #20 (Sept. 1999). Art by [[George Pérez]].]]

===1980s===
His next appearances are in ''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980) as '''Ultron-9''' and in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92-93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982) as '''Ultron-10'''; both appearances feature brainwashed heroes recreating and then defeating the robotic menace.<ref>''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980)</ref><ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92 – 93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982)</ref> After being briefly recreated (as '''Ultron-11''') by the [[Beyonder]] and appearing on Battleworld during the [[Secret Wars]],<ref>''Secret Wars'' (May 1984 to April 1985)</ref> and for a brief encounter with the Thing,<ref>''The Thing'' #21 - 22 (March - April 1985)</ref> Ultron is destroyed again. The Thing, however, does bring Ultron's head back to Earth as a souvenir. The head of Ultron-11 is dropped and forgotten by the Thing when there is an attack by the alien [[Dire Wraiths]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #277 (April 1985)</ref>

A new Ultron ('''Ultron-12''') enters into an alliance with the villain the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and his allies ([[Nekra]]; the [[Erik Josten]] Goliath; [[Man-Ape]] and the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]]) in a bid to destroy the Reaper's brother, [[Wonder Man]]. Although the villains are defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]], Ultron-12 begins to form a relationship with his "father", Henry Pym.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 - 2 (Oct. - Nov. 1985) & ''Vision & The Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #2 (Nov. 1985)</ref> Ultron-12 begins calling itself '''Ultron Mark 12''', in an effort to sound more human.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #6</ref> Rebuilding itself, Ultron-11 comes into conflict with Hank Pym and Ultron-12. With the assistance of Wonder Man, they destroy Ultron-11. Ultron-12 then deactivates, but tells Pym it was glad it could help save him.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #7 (April 1986)</ref>

===1990s===
Ultron appears as a pawn of Doctor Doom; having been rebuilt with all previous personalities active at the same time, resulting in a form of robotic madness. Ultron fights Daredevil before a programming conflict deactivates the robot.<ref>''Daredevil'' #275 - 276 (Dec. - Jan. 1990)</ref>

Another version of Ultron appears ('''Ultron-13''') and is stopped by the ''West Coast Avengers''.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #65 - 68 (Dec. 1990 - Mar. 1991)</ref> After escaping captivity this version attempts to obtain a new form of vibranium called '''Nuform''', but is repelled by the combined efforts of Iron Man, the Black Panther and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #25; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Annual #11 & ''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #7 (all 1991)</ref> Ultron ('''Ultron-11''') next briefly appears as a captive of a highly advanced [[Doombot]], but is freed when the Doombot is defeated by [[Deathlok]].<ref>''Deathlok'' #2 + 5 (Aug. & Nov. 1991)</ref>

'''Ultron-13''' escapes from prison and upgrades into "The Ultimate Ultron", (technically '''Ultron-14''') and captures the West Coast Avenger [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], using her brain patterns to create a new robotic mate called [[Alkhema]]. Alkhema aids Ultron but both are eventually jettisoned into space through a ruse by the Vision.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #89 - 91 (Dec. 1992 - Feb 1993)</ref> The character reappears with Alkhema, and together they plan to create a "volcanic winter" by placing bombs underneath several [[volcanoes]]. The West Coast Avengers stop the pair once again, and Alkhema rebels and leaves Ultron.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Annual #8 (1993)</ref> Another Ultron ('''Ultron-15''') is found by the Vision, but is discovered to have been "infected" by human emotion and is seriously deteriorating, displaying symptoms that resemble [[alcoholism]]. This Ultron and a recreated Jocasta decide to explore the world with the Vision for a time.<ref>''Vision'' #1 - 4 (Nov. 1994 - Feb. 1995)</ref>
[[Image:IronMan-48.jpg|165px|thumb|left|Ultron takes over Iron Man's armor. Cover of ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #48. (Jan. 2002) Art by Udon.]]
After a brief [[cameo appearance]] (as '''Ultron-17''')<ref>''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998)</ref> the character - with the aid of '''Ultron-16''' - slaughters the population of the fictional state Slorenia before once again being defeated by the Avengers, Goliath using vibranium against him.<ref>''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998) & #10 (Nov. 1998)</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #19 - 22 (Aug. - Nov. 1999)</ref>

===2000s===
The Avengers discovered that every creation of Ultron (Vision, Jocasta, Alkhema) has a secret program included - they are subconsciously compelled to rebuild Ultron. In this case, it is Alkhema who unintentionally rebuilds Ultron when she attempts to create a new species of bio-synthezoids. '''Ultron-18''' was, however, composed of steel, not adamantium, and is destroyed when Alkhema's subterranean base exploded after Hawkeye shot Alkhema with a vibranium arrow at her request. Ultron's head was recovered by one of the synthezoids, an artificial girl called '''Antigone'''.<ref>''Avengers: the Ultron Imperative'' (Nov. 2001)</ref>

[[Iron Man]] encounters an Ultron formed from an old version of his armor and the head of '''Ultron-18''', who leads the cult the [[Sons of Yinsen]] in an attempt to conquest via [[religion]]. The character is defeated by Iron Man and Jocasta.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #46 - 48 (Nov. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref>  Another Ultron (possibly '''Ultron-13''') creates the [[cyborg]] [[Victor Mancha]], who is to be used as a [[sleeper agent]] against the Avengers. Mancha, however, rebels, and joins the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2, #1 (April 2005)</ref> This Ultron first poses as [[Doctor Doom]] before revealing itself, and is defeated in a battle against the Runaways and [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]].<ref>"Runaways" vol. 2, #6 (Sep. 2005)</ref>

In June [[2007]], Marvel launched a new Avengers title called ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Frank Cho]]. In the first six issue arc, Ultron interfaces with Iron Man's armor, which Iron Man had integrated with his biology. This allows Ultron's program to transform Iron Man into a new version of Ultron that has the human appearance of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], albeit with a metallic skin. This version takes control of Stark's technology. It kills the Sentry's wife, causing the Sentry to battle Ultron, nearly tearing her head off. This version is eventually destroyed by new Avenger [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], who uses a computer virus (created by the Skrull agent Criti-Noll, who at the time was impersonating Henry Pym) to wipe Ultron's program from Iron Man's armor, turning Stark back. Ultron's image later briefly appears on one of Pym's computers.<ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2007">''Mighty Avengers'' #1 - 6 (June - November. 2007)</ref>

However, this was not the end of Ultron, for his disembodied consciousness was thrown into the depths of space. He spent a few months floating through the cosmos as radio-waves and energy. Eventually his signal was picked up by an outlying group of [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], who were attempting to contact their parent race, the Technarchy. Fascinated by what he found, Ultron decided that the Phalanx lacked direction from a singular conscious, and that he would be perfect for the role. Through sheer force of will he merged himself with the programming of the Phalanx, in turn, they viewed Ultron as the sympathetic father they had yearned for. Under Ultron’s guidance the Phalanx began the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' by invading the [[Kree]] space. Later by taking control of the body of [[Adam Warlock]], Ultron hopes to achieve "true techno-organic perfection", but is eventually forced to abandon Warlock's body by [[Warlock (New Mutants)|the Technarchy Warlock]] and is later destroyed in combat by [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]].<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #1 - 6 (Aug. 2007 - May 2008:bi-monthly)</ref>

In the limited series ''Avengers/[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', it is revealed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[life model decoy]]s have been partly replaced with versions of Ultron. When the original Human Torch appears in the present they covertly parasitize his unique android physiology and become more human. The combined super teams (but mainly the Torch himself), however, discover the plan and destroy the androids.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #7 - 8 (Feb. - Mar. 2009). Issues #1 - 12 (July 2008 - Aug. 2009)</ref>

===2010s===
In the ''Mighty Avengers'', Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself Ultron Pym and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #35 (Mar. 2010)</ref> Pym eventually offers Ultron a compromise, allowing Jocasta to become Ultron's bride, on the condition that Ultron banishes himself to ultraspace. Ultron agrees, but warns that he will be ruler of all someday.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #36 (April 2010)</ref>

In ''The Avengers'', the team visits a possible future in which almost all of mankind is destroyed by Ultron. Kang the Conqueror attempts to enlist them to defeat his robotic foe, but another group of heroes and villains, plucked from all over time and space ends up destroying this Ultron.<ref>''The Avengers'' v.2 - #1-6</ref>

Later, also in ''Avengers'', the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], a cabal of super-intelligent supervillains, discover the inert body of a Galadorian Spaceknight and attempt to reactivate its powersource, hoping to exploit it. Although the Avengers interrupt their attempts, the body activates, revealing it was containing the consciousness of Ultron, who had escaped destruction after the events of ''Annihilation: Conquest''. The new Ultron escapes and Iron Man gravely foresees that when he returns, it will bring the apocalypse for mankind. An 'Age of Ultron' is announced.<ref>''The Avengers'' v.2 - #12.1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors and hands, and an "encephalo-ray", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.

Ultron's outer armor is usually composed of primary [[adamantium]], which is almost completely impervious to damage. (The first use of the term "adamantium" in Marvel Comics was made in reference to Ultron in Avengers #66, published in July 1969).  Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can beam part or all of Ultron's memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including tractor beam apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of alternate Ultron bodies simultaneously,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #19 - 22 (Aug. - Nov. 1999)</ref> although only the 'prime' Ultron was composed of adamantium while others were made of steel or secondary adamantium due to the lack of resources to give all the Ultrons adamantium bodies.{{Issue|date=May 2011}} Ultron also uses an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its workings more malleable and so have the ability to restructure his physical form. What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the [[Scarlet Witch]] is capable of causing malfunctions with her hex power<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Aug. 1977)</ref> and [[Wonder Man]] was once able to destroy an Ultron by throwing it so hard its internal systems were damaged.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

==Other versions==
===Future timelines===
The 1995 limited series ''[[The Last Avengers Story]]'' features a possible future in which '''Ultron-59''' manipulates fellow Avengers foe [[Kang the Conqueror]] into attacking the Avengers. Ultron is destroyed by the Vision, who sacrifices his own artificial life.<ref>''The Last Avengers Story'' #1 - 2 (Nov. - Dec. 1995)</ref>

The ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' storyline "Death of The Invisible Woman" features an advanced humanoid called '''Alex Ultron''' a member of the futuristic ''The Last Defenders''.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #559 (Sep. 2008)</ref> In the ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], Ultron is a highly-intelligent "neural network" that controls a section of the United States defense forces.<ref>''Giant-Size Marvel Adventures: The Avengers'' #1 (Sep. 2007)</ref>

In the first arc of the fourth ''Avengers'' series, Kang wages a war with Ultron in the not-too-distant future which causes the disruption of all time. The cause of the disruption is apparently Kang's recruiting of army after army from the timelines to battle Ultron - all to no avail: Ultron is supreme in this particular future.<ref>''Avengers'' v. 4 #1-4</ref>

===Avengers Next===
The title ''[[Avengers Next]]'', set in an alternate universe, features an upgraded version of Ultron named Ultron Extreme.<ref>''Avengers Next'' #2 - 3 (Nov. - Dec. 1998)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint]] title ''the [[Ultimates]]'', Ultron is the name of a group of robots designed to be expendable super soldiers. They are created by [[Henry Pym#Ultimate Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] along with a partner robot called "Vision II". They are rejected because of Pym's poor personal performance.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #10 - 13 (Dec 2004 - May 2007)</ref> The Ultron robots reappear as butlers to the Ultimates, with one unit developing an independent mind and emotions as a result of a chance encounter with the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #6 (July 2005)</ref> This Ultron eventually impersonates Henry Pym in the persona of Yellowjacket, creates android duplicates of the Ultimates, and is in part responsible for the assassination of the Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #1 - 4 (Feb. - May 2008); #5 (Nov. 2008)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ultron appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'', voiced by [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]]. In this series, Ultron hates Ant-Man, whom he considers his father, and creates the Vision to destroy the Avengers.
* Ultron appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', with [[Tom Kane]] reprising the role. In the episode "Everything is Wonderful", the reason for the hostility between Pym and Stark is revealed that it was Tony Stark who suggested to Hank Pym to use human brainwaves and inserting them into an android thus creating Ultron. However, Pym did not realize that Stark was selling the androids to the military without informing Pym which led to a disagreement over the two which occurred five years before the start of the show. Pym later mentions using the brainwaves of [[Wonder Man|Simon Williams]] for Ultron, similar to his usage for the creation of Vision. On a related note, Miniature Synthezoids resembling Ultron first appeared in the episode "The Man in the Ant Hill" voiced by [[Wally Wingert]]. Miniature Ultron Synthezoids work as guards at the [[Big House (comics)|Big House]]. Henry Pym was shown working on an Ultron Synthezoid head in the episode "Some Assembly Required". In the episode "The Man Who Stole Tomorrow", there are many Ultron robots shown in [[Negative Zone Prison Alpha|Prison 42]] acting as the Prison Guards. In the episode "Come the Conqueror," Ant-Man had to reprogram some of the Ultron Synthezoids (voiced by [[Tom Kane]] here) to help fight Kang's army by teaching them aggression towards enemy forces. In the episode "The Kang Dynasty", Ultron-5 helps Iron Man hack into the main computer of Kang's flagship but couldn't have it send Kang back to the future upon Wasp revealing about the condition of Ravonna. An Ultron was present when Henry Pym, Mister Fantastic, and other geniuses are trying to find a way to keep Ravonna from fading away. Ultron's programming eventually causes him to believe the best way to maintain peace to destroy humanity. In the episode "Ultron-5", he attacks the Avengers, seemingly killing Thor, before being torn apart by the Hulk. In the episode "The Ultron Imperative", Ultron is revealed to have transferred his programming to another body. Taking control of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, he attempts to launch the world's entire nuclear arsenal, annihilating all life on the planet. Ant-Man is able to stop him by uploading data that proves that, as Ultron's mind was based on human thought patterns, he himself was as flawed as humanity, and thus part of the problem rather than the solution. Ultron then shuts down, and his body is later destroyed.
* Ultron appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "So Pretty When They Explode." He appears as the boyfriend of Nova's messenger droid named Holoball.

===Film===
* Ultron appears as the primary antagonist in the [[direct to video]] animated [[feature film]] ''[[Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow]]'' voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. Iron Man (not Henry Pym as in the mainstream series) created Ultron to be a force for peace, but its programming evolved coming to think that the only way to truly bring order to Earth was to control it. Then it attacked the Avengers killing most of them (Captain America, Wasp, Hawkeye, Black Panther,  Giant-Man, and Black Widow). Before they died however, Iron Man gathered their children and took them to a safe place in the Arctic Circle. Later, when James accidentally activated the Iron Avengers, Ultron detected the energy source, found the Iron Avengers, and took control of them. He later captured Iron Man and imprisoned him in the Citadel. The children rescued him and escaped with some help of Hawkeye's son Francis and the Scavengers (all that remains of humanity). In the desert, James turned on the ship that he, his friends, Iron Man and Betty escaped in to lure Ultron to the Hulk. The evil robot arrived and battled the Hulk, knocking him out. He then blasted at James with a energy blast which nearly killed the boy. The Hulk grabbed Ultron, beat him and ripped him in half. When Ultron started to rebuild himself, Torunn - daughter of the absent Thor and [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] - grabbed the two separated pieces and threw them into space where Ultron could not rebuild himself.

===Video games===
* Ultron appears in the [[arcade game]] ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]''.

* Ultron appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[James Horan (actor)|James Horan]]. He is shown as a lieutenant in [[Doctor Doom]]'s Masters of Evil. He also sends [[Mysterio]] to steal his upgrade plans from the Omega Base so that Ultron can upgrade himself with them, who fails thanks to the heroes. Ultron is deserted along with [[Baron Mordo]] by Doctor Doom after he captures Odin as they are seen trying to follow them by choosing Odin's spear, but the heroes battle them and defeat them.

* Ultron appears as a villain character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.
