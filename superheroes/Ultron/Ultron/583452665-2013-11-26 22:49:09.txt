==Fictional character biography==

===1960s===
Although Ultron first appears in ''Avengers'' #54 (1968), the character is disguised for the majority of the issue as the [[Crimson Cowl]], with his face only revealed on the last page of the issue and no name given to the character. The character leads the [[Masters of Evil]] against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], having hypnotized [[Edwin Jarvis]] into working for him. In the following issue, #55 (Aug. 1968), the character is identified as '''Ultron-5, the living automaton''', although his origin is still unknown.<ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (July - Aug. 1968)</ref> In ''Avengers'' 57 - 58 (Oct-Nov. 1968) in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence it is revealed that Ultron is the creator of the "synthezoid" the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], whom it tries to use as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. The Vision—similar to [[Wonder Man]], whose brain patterns he was given—however, destroys Ultron with the aid of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #57 (Oct. 1968)</ref>

Further flashbacks reveal that Ultron is the creation of [[Henry Pym]], and based on Pym's brain patterns. The robot gradually developed its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately develops an [[Oedipus Complex]], whereby it feels irrational hatred for his "father" Hank, and demonstrates an interest in Hank's lover Janet van Dyne, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. Rebuilding itself, learning how to turn itself on, and upgrading five times, Ultron then [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Pym and [[brainwashing|brainwashes]] him into forgetting that the robot had ever existed.<ref>''The Avengers'' #58 (Nov. 1968)</ref>

The character's next appearance is in ''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969), where the character, now referring to itself as '''Ultron-6''', uses the fictional alloy [[adamantium]] to upgrade his body to an almost indestructible state. Taking the name Ultimate Ultron, its plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969)</ref>

===1970s===
A crossover story between ''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) and ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974) features Ultron (now '''Ultron-7'''), recreated by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] with the body of the android [[Omega (Marvel Comics)|Omega]], attacking the wedding of the Inhuman [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and the Avenger [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and battling the Avengers, [[Inhumans]], and [[Fantastic Four]] before being destroyed once again.<ref>''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) & ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> The character next appears in ''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977) as '''Ultron-8''' where it is responsible for the creation of [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] whom it wishes to take as a robotic bride.<ref>''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977)</ref> Shortly afterwards, in ''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978), the Avengers, with the aid of [[Ms. Marvel]] battle and defeat '''Ultron-8'''.<ref>''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978)</ref>

===1980s===
His next appearances are in ''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980) as '''Ultron-9''' and in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92-93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982) as '''Ultron-10'''; both appearances feature brainwashed heroes recreating and then defeating the robotic menace.<ref>''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980)</ref><ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92 – 93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982)</ref> After being briefly recreated (as '''Ultron-11''') by the [[Beyonder]] and appearing on Battleworld during the [[Secret Wars]],<ref>''Secret Wars'' (May 1984 to April 1985)</ref> and for a brief encounter with the Thing,<ref>''The Thing'' #21 - 22 (March - April 1985)</ref> Ultron is destroyed again. The Thing, however, does bring Ultron's head back to Earth as a souvenir. The head of Ultron-11 is dropped and forgotten by the Thing when there is an attack by the alien [[Dire Wraiths]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #277 (April 1985)</ref>

A new Ultron ('''Ultron-12''') enters into an alliance with the villain the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and his allies ([[Nekra]]; the [[Erik Josten]] Goliath; [[Man-Ape]] and the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]]) in a bid to destroy the Reaper's brother, [[Wonder Man]]. Although the villains are defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]], Ultron-12 begins to form a relationship with his "father", Henry Pym.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #1-2 (Oct. - Nov. 1985) and ''Vision & The Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #2 (Nov. 1985)</ref> Ultron-12 begins calling itself '''Ultron Mark 12''', in an effort to sound more human.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref> Rebuilding itself, Ultron-11 comes into conflict with Hank Pym and Ultron-12. With the assistance of Wonder Man, they destroy Ultron-11. Ultron-12 then deactivates, but tells Pym it was glad it could help save him.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #7 (April 1986)</ref>

===1990s===
Ultron appears as a pawn of Doctor Doom; having been rebuilt with all previous personalities active at the same time, resulting in a form of robot madness. Ultron fights Daredevil before a programming conflict deactivates the robot.<ref>''Daredevil'' #275 - 276 (Dec. - Jan. 1990)</ref>

Another version of Ultron appears ('''Ultron-13''') and is stopped by the ''West Coast Avengers''.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #65 - 68 (Dec. 1990 - Mar. 1991)</ref> After escaping captivity this version attempts to obtain a new form of vibranium called '''Nuform''', but is repelled by the combined efforts of Iron Man, the Black Panther and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #25, ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Annual #11, and ''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #7 (1991)</ref> Ultron ('''Ultron-11''') next briefly appears as a captive of a highly advanced [[Doombot]], but is freed when the Doombot is defeated by [[Deathlok]].<ref>''Deathlok'' #2, 5 (Aug. and Nov. 1991)</ref>

'''Ultron-13''' escapes from prison and upgrades into "The Ultimate Ultron", (technically '''Ultron-14''') and captures the West Coast Avenger [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], using her brain patterns to create a new robotic mate called [[Alkhema]]. Alkhema aids Ultron but both are eventually jettisoned into space through a ruse by the Vision.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #89 - 91 (Dec. 1992 - Feb 1993)</ref> The character reappears with Alkhema, and together they plan to create a "volcanic winter" by placing bombs underneath several [[volcanoes]].

===2000s===
The Avengers discovered that every creation of Ultron (Vision, Jocasta, Alkhema) has a secret program included - they are subconsciously compelled to rebuild Ultron. In this case, it is Alkhema who unintentionally rebuilds Ultron when she attempts to create a new species of bio-synthezoids. '''Ultron-18''' was, however, composed of steel, not adamantium, and is destroyed when Alkhema's subterranean base exploded after Hawkeye shot Alkhema with a vibranium arrow at her request. Ultron's head was recovered by one of the synthezoids, an artificial girl called '''Antigone'''.<ref>''Avengers: the Ultron Imperative'' (Nov. 2001)</ref>

[[Iron Man]] encounters an Ultron formed from an old version of his armor and the head of '''Ultron-18''', who leads the cult the [[Sons of Yinsen]] in an attempt to conquest via [[religion]].

[[Image:Femaleultron.PNG|165px|thumb|right|The female '''Ultron''', as seen on the cover for ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' #2 (July 2007) Art by [[Frank Cho]].]]
In June 2007, Marvel launched a new Avengers title called ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Frank Cho]]. In the first six issue arc, Ultron interfaces with Iron Man's armor, which Iron Man had integrated with his biology. This allows Ultron's program to transform Iron Man into a new version of Ultron, that has the appearance of the human [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], albeit with a metallic skin. This version takes control of Stark's technology. He kills the Sentry's wife, causing the Sentry to battle Ultron, nearly tearing his head off. This version is eventually destroyed by new Avenger [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], who uses a computer virus (created by the Skrull agent Criti-Noll, who at the time was impersonating Henry Pym) to wipe Ultron's program from Iron Man's armor, changing Tony Stark back to normal. Ultron's image later briefly appears on one of Pym's computers.<ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2007">''Mighty Avengers'' #1 - 6 (June - November. 2007)</ref>

However, this was not the end of Ultron, for his disembodied consciousness was thrown into the depths of space. He spent a few months floating through the cosmos as radio-waves and energy. Eventually his signal was picked up by an outlying group of [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], who were attempting to contact their parent race, the Technarchy. Fascinated by what he found, Ultron decided that the Phalanx lacked direction from a singular conscious, and that he would be perfect for the role. Through sheer force of will he merged himself with the programming of the Phalanx, in turn, they viewed Ultron as the sympathetic father they had yearned for. Under Ultron’s guidance the Phalanx began the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' by invading the [[Kree]] space. Later by taking control of the body of [[Adam Warlock]], Ultron hopes to achieve "true techno-organic perfection", but is eventually forced to abandon Warlock's body by [[Warlock (New Mutants)|the Technarchy Warlock]] and is later destroyed in combat by [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]].<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #1 - 6 (Aug. 2007 - May 2008:bi-monthly)</ref>

In the limited series ''Avengers/[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', it is revealed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[life model decoy]]s have been partly replaced with versions of Ultron. When the original Human Torch appears in the present they covertly parasitize his unique android physiology and become more human. The combined super teams (but mainly the Torch himself), however, discover the plan and destroy the androids.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #7 - 8 (Feb. - Mar. 2009). Issues #1 - 12 (July 2008 - Aug. 2009)</ref>

===2010s===
In the ''Mighty Avengers'', Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself Ultron Pym and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #35 (Mar. 2010)</ref> Pym eventually offers Ultron a compromise, allowing Jocasta to become Ultron's bride, on the condition that Ultron banishes himself to ultraspace. Ultron agrees, but warns that he will be ruler of all someday.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #36 (April 2010)</ref>

In ''The Avengers'', the team visits a possible future in which almost all of mankind is destroyed by Ultron. Kang the Conqueror attempts to enlist them to defeat his robotic foe, but another group of heroes and villains, plucked from all over time and space ends up destroying this Ultron.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4, #1-6 (Jul. - Dec. 2010)</ref>

Later, also in ''Avengers'', the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], a cabal of super-intelligent supervillains, discover the inert body of a Galadorian Spaceknight and attempt to reactivate its powersource, hoping to exploit it. Although the Avengers interrupt their attempts, the body activates, revealing it contains the consciousness of Ultron, who had escaped destruction after the events of ''Annihilation: Conquest''. The new Ultron escapes and Iron Man gravely foresees that when he returns, it will bring the apocalypse for mankind.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4, #12.1 (Jun. 2011)</ref>

During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Ultron has returned and conquers the world while slowly remolding it into his image. His Ultron Sentinels are guarding the streets looking for any fugitives. Hawkeye runs into the Ultron Sentinels as he was rescuing the [[Doctor Octopus|Superior Spider-Man]] yet manages to destroy the Ultron Sentinels present.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Bryan Hitch|Hitch, Bryan]]|inker= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|title= Age of Ultron|issue= 1|date= May 2013}}</ref> It is later revealed that Ultron is actually in the future and has been using Vision as a conduit to punish humanity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Hitch, Bryan|inker= Neary, Paul|title= Age of Ultron|issue= 4|date= June 2013}}</ref> While one strike team travels into the future to fight Ultron, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Invisible Woman]] go back in time to kill Pym before he can create Ultron in the first place.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #6</ref> This results in a world where Tony Stark controls an army of robotic drones and that [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] has conquered half of the world.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #7</ref> Traveling back in time once more, Wolverine succeeds in stopping himself from killing Pym, and he, Pym and Susan Storm come up with a different plan. This plan results in a different outcome of the prior confrontation between the Avengers and the Intelligencia - a 'back door' installed into Ultron at his original creation allows Hank Pym and Iron Man to destroy the robot, instead, averting the events that led to the 'Age of Ultron'.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #8-10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors and hands, and an "encephalo-ray", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.

Ultron's outer armor is usually composed of primarily [[adamantium]], which is almost completely impervious to damage. (The first use of the term "adamantium" in Marvel Comics was made in reference to Ultron in Avengers #66, published in July 1969).  Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can beam part or all of Ultron's memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including tractor beam apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of other Ultron bodies simultaneously,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #19 - 22 (Aug. - Nov. 1999)</ref> although only the 'prime' Ultron was composed of adamantium while others were made of steel or secondary adamantium due to the lack of resources to give all the Ultrons adamantium bodies.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #22 (Nov. 1999)</ref> Ultron also uses an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its workings more malleable and so have the ability to restructure his physical form. What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the [[Scarlet Witch]] is capable of causing malfunctions with her hex power,<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Aug. 1977)</ref> [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], using his nova burst, managed to damage Ultron's internal circuits while his outer armor remained intact,<ref>''Secret Wars'' #12</ref> and [[Wonder Man]] was once able to destroy an Ultron by throwing it so hard its internal systems were damaged.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

==In other media==

===Television===
* Ultron is featured as a regular character in the animated series ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'', voiced by [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]].

* Ultron appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "So Pretty When They Explode". He appears as the boyfriend of Nova's messenger droid named Holoball.

* Ultron appears as a [[recurring character]] in the animated series ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kane]], reprising his role from ''Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow''. He was created by Henry Pym as guards for the [[Big House (comics)|Big House]] supervillain prison, and Pym had plans to use Ultron to help solve the world's chaos and violence. Tony Stark modified Ultron by adding weapons to it, hoping to sell it to the military, much to Pym's displeasure. When the forces of [[Kang the Conqueror]] invaded the world, Pym reluctantly reprogrammed Ultron to understand the concept of violence, and used the army of Ultron robots to fight back. While Ultron was invaluable in the battle against Kang, he had gained self-awareness, and was secretly conducting his own scheme to take his programmed logic to its extreme. He had been programmed to bring peace and order to the earth, and the only way he saw that to be possible was to completely wipe out all humans, as he saw the human race to be irredeemably flawed. He first made his move by manipulating the Avengers and various supervillains into situations that made it possible for him to upgrade himself without notice. He finally revealed his plan by knocking out his creator, Hank Pym, capturing Wasp (because he was programmed to not harm her), seemingly vaporizing Thor, and defeating the Avengers in combat, until the Hulk arrived and ripped apart Ultron's body. Pym and Stark then destroyed all remaining parts of Ultron, but he had already translocated his mind into another body stored in Stark Tower. Ultron later returned, taking over every computer system on the planet, including Iron Man's armors, and SHIELD. By mind probing Maria Hill, the Director of SHIELD, Ultron gained the access codes to launch every nuclear missile that SHIELD had control of; enough to wipe out the whole planet. Even with the return of Thor, the Avengers could not defeat Ultron, who had upgraded his weaponry to extremely powerful levels. Hank Pym finally devised a way to defeat him by shrinking down and entering Ultron's body to enter a new logical programming into him. This programming forced Ultron to shut himself down, because it revealed that Ultron's original mind-pattern was based up Pym's own brain waves, therefore making Ultron as flawed as the rest of humanity, and unable to live in his own orderly world. The nuclear missiles were stopped by Tony Stark, who hacked into the system and stopped them at the very last second. Ultron reappeared in Season Two, where he created his "son", the Vision, named such because he was the ultimate example of his "vision for the future"; to replace humanity with their flawed emotions and free wills with cold, emotionless, "perfect" robots. Vision began his master's new imperative by collecting adamantium from Weapon X and attempting to collect vibranium from Wakanda, namely the pieces of Captain America's shattered shield. Vision only retrieved the adamantium, and thus Ultron created a new and improved redesigned body made of pure adamantium. Ultron also created robotic dopplegangers of each of the Avengers, taking the real Avengers out one by one and keeping them locked in stasis while the information from their minds was fed to their bodies. He also planned to transfer Wasp's mind into a feminine robotic companion for himself: Jocasta. Captain America, however, managed to destroy his doppleganger and infiltrate Ultron's base by pretending to be the robot. While the other Robo-vengers were fooled, Ultron was not, and he ordered Vision to fight and kill Captain America to prove his loyalty. Vision, however, seeing Cap's selflessness and courage and being inspired by him, turned on Ultron and freed the Avengers, who proceeded to destroy their robot counterparts. Ultron himself, however, was too much for them, as his new adamantium body was completely invulnerable, even by a blow from Mjolnir. As Ultron proceeded to beat the Avengers, boasting that he would never tire and would defeat them all eventually, the Vision stopped him by phasing through his head and disconnecting it from his body. Ultron turned on him, but Thor proceeded to finish the job by knocking Ultron's head clean off his body with Mjolnir. Vision joined the Avengers soon after.

===Film===
* Ultron appears as the main antagonist in the [[direct-to-video]] animated film ''[[Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kane]], who also voiced Tony Stark, and the [[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]] version of Ultron. In this version, he was the one responsible for killing most of the Avengers (Thor is now ruling Asgard, Iron Man is taking care of the Avengers' kids, and Vision is keeping an eye on Ultron,) and taking over most of the world. He seeks to kill all those who pose a threat towards him and wipe out the humans to make the perfect world. Ultron was created by Tony Stark to be the replacement for the Avengers when they retire. But Ultron's Artificial Intelligence evolved over time, believing that in order to protect humanity, he had to conquer it. So he turned against the Avengers and killed Captain America, Giant-Man, Wasp, Black Panther, Black Widow, and eventually Hawkeye. Before Captain America was killed, he told Iron Man to take the children in a safe location where Ultron couldn't find them. For nearly 15 years, Ultron killed nearly every hero on Earth and placed what was left of the fallen heroes in a trophy room, took over half of the world, and searched endlessly for Tony Stark, eventually believing that to create the perfect world, he would need to destroy anyone and anything that was imperfect. After James (Son of Captain America, and Black Widow) accidentally awakened the Iron Avengers (Robotic Counterparts of the Avengers), Ultron found Tony Stark in the Arctic Circle. Ultron started by corrupting the Iron Avergers, and attacked the sanctuary, where he learned of the existence of the Avengers' offspring, a potential threat to Ultron. To protect the children from Ultron, Iron Man tried to fight Ultron, but Ultron easily defeated Iron Man. But instead of killing Tony, Ultron decided to keep him captive, as a trap for the children. When the Children decided to rescue Tony, Ultron was waiting for them. He was about to kill them, when Barton (the son of Hawkeye) interfered and rescued them. The Children realized that they were no match for Ultron, so they decided to go to the desert to find the Hulk, the strongest being in the world. When they found the Hulk (as Bruce Banner), Bruce refused to help. In order to destroy Ultron once and for all, James decided to bring Ultron towards the Hulk. When Ultron found the Children, he, along with the Iron Avengers flew towards the desert to kill off what remains of the Avengers. Pym (son of Giant-Man and Wasp) was able to make Bruce angry and bring forth the Hulk. When the Hulk destroyed the Iron Avengers, Ultron appeared and proceeded to fight the Hulk. Hulk tried to fight back, but was defeated and knocked out. The Children decided to fight Ultron, but they were quickly defeated. Pym revived Hulk by telling him that Ultron said that he was weak and Ultron was the strongest being alive. With that, Hulk grabbed Ultron and ripped him in half. Despite being ripped in half, Ultron slowly began to repair himself, so to stop him, Torunn (Daughter of Thor) grabbed Ultron, flew out of the atmosphere, and tossed both halves of him deep into outer space, ending Ultron once and for all.
