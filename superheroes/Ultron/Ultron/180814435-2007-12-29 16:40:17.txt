'''Ultron''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]]. Ultron is an [[android]] that believes in the superiority of mechanical entities over [[human]]s and organic life in general, and has often endeavored to either exterminate those "lesser" beings or convert them into mechanical forms. The character first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #54 (1968).

With few exceptions, Ultron's independent plans have predominately brought him into conflict with the Avengers, sometimes out of a deliberate desire of his to confront them where other villains would prefer to avoid such a fight. Ultron has many different links to the Avengers; most prominently, he regards [[Hank Pym]] and [[Janet van Dyne]], founding members of the team, as his 'parents', and has developed an [[Oedipus Complex]] in his relationship with them, attempting to kill Hank and once using Janet's brain patterns to try and create a bride for himself. Ultron's original 'bride', [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], also went on to become a member of the team, and his second 'wife', [[Alkhema]], became a significant threat to the group in her own right.

As a result of him being Ultron's creator, Hank Pym has often confessed to a strong sense of guilt about Ultron's actions, a fact that was explained when it was revealed that Ultron's brain patterns were based on his own, and he thus felt that Ultron's murderous attitude reflected how he felt deep inside. [[Iron Man]] has also admitted to some personal discomfort around Ultron, the robot reminding him of all the times his armour has been stolen and used to kill innocent people, a discomfort that doubtless only increased after his armour became sentient and attempted to kill him after unintentionally absorbing the programmed 'Ultron Imperative' when downloading Jocasta's intelligence to save her life.

==Fictional character biography==
===Creation===
Ultron was created by [[Henry Pym]], based on Pym's own brain patterns, and was intended to serve Pym in his superheroic identity of Goliath. Ultron became [[sentience|sentient]] and rebelled, seeming to instantly demonstrate an [[Oedipus Complex]] (As noted by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]), where he felt irrational hatred for his "father" Hank, and demonstrated a frightening interest in Hank's lover Janet van Dyne, aka [[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]]. He quickly [[hypnosis|hypnotized]] Pym and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] him into forgetting that Ultron had ever existed. He then went on to organize the [[Masters of Evil]] under the guise of the Crimson Cowl, and battled Pym and his teammates in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

==="Family"===
Ultron has since generally remained a solo operative, being too monomaniacally genocidal to willingly work alongside any human for any length of time. His most notable achievement may be the creation of the "synthezoid" called the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], whose body was a copy of the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] and whose mind was based on that of [[Wonder Man]]. Ironically, although the Vision fought the Avengers at first, he joined the team soon after, becoming one of their most prominent members and even leading the team at one point. Ultron also created a "mate", [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] (Regarded by Black Panther as one of the proofs of his 'Oedipus Complex), who also joined the Avengers. Ultron tried again with the creation of [[Alkhema]] the War Toy, whose mind was based on that of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. Like his other creations, Alkhema turned on him, although she alone shared his desire to replace humanity with machine life; their only fundamental difference was that Ultron wanted to destroy all of humanity at once while Alkhema preferred to enjoy herself by doing it one at a time. Ultron was also responsible for the creation of the cyborg [[Victor Mancha]]. When it was revealed that Ultron was the boy's "father", Victor promptly turned on him and joined the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].

===Incarnations===
[[Image:Ultronrebornevil.png|205px|left|thumb|Ultron returns in ''Avengers'' (v3) #19. Art by [[George PÃ©rez]].]]

Although Ultron has been destroyed many times, he has rebuilt himself anew each time, usually renumbering himself in the process. Ultron-1 was Pym's first creation; by the time he first met the Avengers, he had already improved himself to the iteration of Ultron-5. Several of his bodies, beginning with Ultron-6, have been composed of [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] or of a slightly weaker adamantium alloy called "secondary adamantium". Ultron-7 had the gigantic body of [[Omega (Marvel Comics)|Omega]], distinguishing him from the various other Ultrons, but this body was not composed of adamantium and was destroyed by the [[Fantastic Four]]. Using his 'father's' recent mental breakdown (Causing Hank to revert to his Ant-Man persona and forget that Ultron even existed), Ultron-8 tricked Hank Pym into helping him create Jocasta as a 'bride' after attacking the Avengers with his encephalo-ray, putting them into a death-like coma. However, [[Iron Man]], [[Wonder Man]], the Vision and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] were all left standing (Iron Man and the Black Panther were protected from the ray by their costumes, and Wonder Man's ionic nature and the Vision's android body rendered them immune to the ray's effects), and, with the aid of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] (Who had been away from the mansion at the time of the attack) managed to track down Ultron and save Jan. Although Ultron was forced to escape when Iron Man threatened Jocasta, he was later destroyed by the [[Scarlet Witch]], whose probability-manipulation powers let her disrupt his internal workings.

Ultron-11 was re-created by the [[Beyonder]] to battle alongside other villains during the [[Secret Wars]]; he only cooperated with his human "teammates" after being temporarily de-powered by [[Galactus]] and subsequently reprogrammed by [[Doctor Doom]]. Although he was taken out of the fight when the [[Johnny Storm|Human Torch]]'s nova flame melted some of his non-adamantium internal components when activated at practically point-blank range, he was resurrected by Doom and [[Klaw]] using the power of the Beyonder, only for the Wasp to yank wires out of his internal components after the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] managed to create a crack in his armour. The next incarnation, Ultron-12, initially joined the [[Lethal Legion]] to battle the Vision and his new family (his wife, the Scarlet Witch, and his mental "brother", [[Wonder Man]]), but came to reconsider his actions. He reconciled with his "father", Henry Pym, and renamed himself from "Ultron Mark 12" to "Mark" but was destroyed by Ultron-11. Ultron-11 was destroyed in retaliation by [[Wonder Man]], who threw him so hard that his non-adamantium internal components were damaged. 

Ultron-13 was rebuilt by Doctor Doom with all of its predecessors' memories, and as an unforeseen consequence had all thirteen personalities running in its mind at once. Attempting to battle itself, Ultron-13 tore itself apart, to the benefit of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who had been attempting to fight it with no success whatsoever. The next incarnation of Ultron created his "mate", Alkhema, but after several battles against various foes, as well as Alkhema's betrayal of him, his programming degenerated and he began acting like a drunken homeless person.

===Ultron Unlimited===
[[Image:Avengersv3n20.jpg|205px|right|thumb|Cover art for ''Avengers'' (v3) #20.<br>Art by [[George Perez]]. ]]
The next Ultron gave itself a body made of pure adamantium. It recreated all of the previous Ultrons and created hundreds of new Ultron bodies, several of whom had bodies made of secondary adamantium (Although the majority were only made of titanium due to the lack of adamantium to build that many Ultrons), and reprogrammed them all with fiercely loyal minds. The army of Ultrons completely obliterated the fictional Eastern European nation of Slorenia, and, to taunt the Avengers arranged the corpses so that, when viewed from space, a likeness of Ultron's "face" could be seen. 

Although Ultron attempted to transform his "family" (Pym, Vision, Wonder Man, the Scarlet Witch, Pym's ex-wife the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and Wonder Man's brother the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]) into androids- having realised that he needed to create other androids when he had created his new mechanical world or he would grow bored from living alone-, the process was interrupted by the remaining Avengers, consisting of [[Captain America]], Thor, Iron Man, and [[Firestar]], with the Black Panther aiding them after an attack on the [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakandan]] embassy and [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] out of action due to a broken leg. This team of Avengers managed to destroy the army of Ultrons thanks to the efforts of Thor, (who could destroy secondary adamantium if he put enough effort into his attacks) and Iron Man (who acquired a molecular rearranger- the only thing that stopped adamantium robots 'freezing'- from one of the fallen Ultrons and reprogrammed it to destroy all adamantium in its vicinity).

After the Vision and the Grim Reaper managed to shut down the systems holding Ultron's 'family' prisoner, the primary Ultron was destroyed by Pym, wielding a chunk of "anti-metal" (Antarctic [[vibranium]]) provided by Justice after he studied the records of previous fights with Ultron, which completely disintegrated the robot and thus deactivated all of its drone units. It is at that point that it is learned that Ultron was the source for all of Hank Pym's psychological problems; Pym had been troubled by the thought that Ultron's evil brain was based directly off of his own thought patterns, which led him to think that Ultron's horrible nature was what truly lay in Hank's mind.

===Ultron Imperative===
Alkhema used the data obtained during Ultron's human-to-android conversion process to create a small army of androids based on those who had been undergoing the process. Hidden programming to recreate Ultron - the "Ultron Imperative" - had been implanted in Alkhema by Ultron when he created her, and this programming caused her to copy the Imperative into her own creations. 

The Ultron Imperative caused them to unknowingly rebuild Ultron, who attempted to destroy both the Avengers and Alkhema's own android "children". Alkhema allowed [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] to kill her and her creations in order to destroy Ultron, although Ultron's decapitated head survived with his mind intact. His head was picked up by Antigone, an undeveloped, child-like creation of Alkhema's, who initially did not obey his commands.

===Sentient armor===
[[Image:Imv3no30.jpg|thumb|225px|left|''Iron Man'' Vol. 3,#30 (July 2000). The Sentient Armor. Art by [[Joe Quesada]].]]
Some time prior to this, when Ultron was thought dead following the Slorenia massacre, Jocasta, who had come into the 'employ' of Tony Stark by serving as his personal artificial psychologist, was compelled by the Ultron Imperative that also existed within her to reprogram the Iron Man armor to serve as a vessel for Ultron's rebirth. However, a lightning strike on the armor corrupted and accelerated the process, giving the armour a sentience that Jocasta outlandishly passed off as the effects of [[Y2K]]. However, although the armour's mind was based on Tony's, it lacked his restraint and morals, killing the villain [[Blacklash|Whiplash]] in retaliation for an earlier 'injury' despite Tony's insistence that it stop attacking him. Obsessed with Tony, and determined to become ''the'' 'Iron Man' with him, the armour took Tony to a desert island, hoping to coerce him into permanently joining with it and thus becoming "''so much more than Iron Man''". In the resulting struggle between the two, although Tony managed to do some damage by predicting what the armour was likely to do and setting up traps to accommodate it, he had a heart attack in the fight. After the armour sacrificed its life to save him, Tony buried it on the island, respecting that it had finally understood the true meaning of sacrifice by creating a 'grave' for it saying 'Here lies Iron Man, Avenger'; he had earlier said that the armour's lack of understanding about sacrifice would stop it ever being a true hero.

The armor was subsequently recovered by a cult that worshipped Iron Man's mentor, Ho Yinsen, with the intent of implanting Yinsen's brain into the suit. This was apparently accomplished, but then Ultron and Antigone struck. Ultron affixed his head to the armor and took control of it, battling Iron Man with the aid of the cult, who he had transformed using Tony Stark's SKIN technology. Ultron and Antigone subsequently vanished in an explosion, but reappeared later in a hospital; it was revealed Antigone's synthezoid-like body was now occupied by Jocasta's mind, and she ended up leaving on her own with Ultron's deactivated head.

===Victor Mancha===
{{main|Victor Mancha}}
Ultron returned in the pages of ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' as the "father" of [[Victor Mancha]], a teenage boy who is supposedly going to one day kill every hero in the Marvel Universe against his will. It was originally believed that [[Doctor Doom]] was the boy's father, but this incarnation of Doom turned out to be a Doombot, created by Ultron. Victor is a cybernetic/human hybrid. Victor turns on Ultron, which allows the Runaways to escape; Ultron is eventually defeated by the group [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]].

===Female Ultron===
[[Image:Femaleultron.PNG|200px|thumb|right|Female Ultron. Art by [[Frank Cho]].]]
''[[Mighty Avengers]]'' #1, [[Ms. Marvel]] found herself leading her team of Avengers into battle against the [[Mole Man]] and his monsters. Distraught over the destruction of his subterranean kingdom, the Mole Man once again declares war on the surface world. When the fighting subsides, the Mole Man learns that the surface world is not responsible for the destruction.

During this exchange, Tony Stark's Iron Man armor unexpectedly begins a metamorphosis, the end result being a new being all together. This new being is a naked woman of considerable power as she is able to lay waste to the surrounding horde of monsters as well as incapacitate both [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]. 

Fearful, [[Ms. Marvel]] orders a hasty retreat, but [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] goes against orders and begins to talk with the woman, whom bears a striking, reflection-like resemblance to Janet: only to discover that her [[doppelgÃ¤nger]] is a new version of Ultron. Ms. Marvel orders the Avengers to make a full retreat, however the Sentry stays behind to make sure they make it out in one piece. In the ensuing battle, the fleshy tone to the female Ultron's skin begins to disappear, and her entire body takes on a completely metallic sheen.

Ultron then takes over and crashes a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] carrier, which was saved at the last second by the Sentry (along with Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man) which gave Ultron the chance to escape. She then broadcasted a message into every electronic device on Earth, stating that the world would soon be destroyed by her hand, and not to worry because there was no way to stop it. Upon realization that Ultron was utilizing Tony Stark's weather changing satellites, which, according to the Starktech 9, were only in stage two of production, Wonder Man and Sentry flew into space and destroyed them. At which time Ultron put into action 'Plan B' of her plan, which thus far seems to consist of killing Sentry's wife. The Avengers have also noted that, so far, Ultron's plans are simply variations on plans that have been previously used by other villains. With time running out, as the Sentry and Ultron clash, the team decide to deliver a virus into Ultron's system, using [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]--whom Ultron has never encountered before--as the point man for the subsequent attack. Ultron is defeated, and Iron Man returned to normal, but an image of Ultron's head is later seen on Henry Pym's computer screen.

===Phalanx===
[[Image:Ultron conquest.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Ultron in [[Annihilation: Conquest|''Annihilation: Conquest'']].]]
One of Ultron's bodies is the leader of the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], as revealed in [[Annihilation: Conquest]] #1, and has overseen their development into a new form; he has overseen their conquest of [[Kree]] space. [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]] have stated "Ultronâs phenomenal drive and force of will has turned him into a the sympathetic father figure the Phalanx has always craved", and he has "vast" plans that will include Earth.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=135562 "SPOILER SPORT: ANNIHILATION: CONQUEST #1"] interview on newsarama.com forum</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ultron's abilities vary with each redesign, but typically include superhuman strength and durability, the power of flight, and various offensive weapons such as concussion blasters, radiation emitters and his "encephalo-ray", which plunges its victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and outright mind-control his victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron's outer shell is usually composed of pure Adamantium, rendering it almost totally impervious to damage; even a punch from the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] only caused a small crack through which the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] could enter and disable his internal mechanisms. (''Secret Wars'' #12) These are generally less durable, as demonstrated when Wonder Man managed to destroy Ultron by throwing him so hard that they shattered. Ultron's Adamantium forms have proven vulnerable to molecular rearrangement devices and the metal-destabilizing ore known as Savage Land Vibranium ("anti-metal"). Some Ultron models feature tractor beams and energy absorption capabilities.

Most Ultrons are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace, and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can beam part or all of Ultron's programming into remote locations such as computers or alternate robotic bodies. Ultron can often control other machines remotely even if he has not transplanted his consciousness into them. One recent Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing him to animate and control hundreds of alternate Ultron bodies at the same time, becoming a robotic one-man army. Ultron is one of the foremost robotics experts on Earth.

Ultron has one sole major weakness: an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of his internal workings more malleable, thus giving him a means to remodel or reconstruct his physical form. However, it has no effect on his outer armor, so it is virtually impossible to disable it from the inside. The chaos magic wielded by the [[Scarlet Witch]] have proven to be the sole exception thus far.

==Other versions==

===JLA/Avengers===
During a flashback in [[JLA/Avengers]] #3 (during the story, reality is altered making it appear that both teams have been crossing into each others universe previously), an adventure is mentioned about Ultron-4 and [[Amazo]] imprisoning both teams in their own headquarters.

===Marvel Adventures===
In the [[Marvel Adventures]] universe, Ultron is a highly-intelligent "neural network" that controls a section of the United States defence forces. It has made two appearances in the series, issues #1 and #4. In Marvel Adventures - The Avengers #1, Ultron is revealed as a long-term replacement for costumed heroes; it goes rogue, however, and plans to destroy all human life. In #4, it teams up with other villains the Avengers had fought in the books so far and attempts to wipe them out. The group of villains is manipulated to turn on itself, allowing the Avengers to escape.

===MC2===
In ''Avengers Next'' #2 and #3; an upgraded version of Ultron, named Ultron Extreme, was featured.

===Ultimate Ultron===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Ultron has been shown as a robot designed to be an expendable super soldier in issue #6 of ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates 2]]''. It was created by [[Henry Pym#Ultimate Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] along with a partner robot called Vision II. Pym allied himself with the foreign superhuman force known as the Liberators, and in ''The Ultimates'' #10, hundreds of Ultron robots are being used as a peace-keeping force in the invaded New York City. They look similar to the robots in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', except the Ultrons are green. In issue #12 they have shown some personality when Pym told them they were to attack the Liberators.

==In other media==
===Television===
Ultron appears as a recuring villain in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' animated series. He was voiced by [[John Stocker]]. He debuts in the premiere episodes '''Avengers Assemble''' Parts 1 and 2. He would appear briefly at the end of an episode. His origin is mentioned in the series premiere (created by Hank Pym to serve mankind), but is shown in more detail in the comic, '''Avengers: United They Stand''' #1. In a nod to the comic book version's habit of upgrading himself, Ultron would periodically appear with a new body from episode to episode.{{or|date=October 2007}}

===Movies===
Ultron is said to appear in ''[[Next Avengers]]'' voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. He is the main antagonist and he kills some of the Avengers early in the film.

===Video games===
* Ultron appears in [[Captain America and the Avengers]].
* Ultron himself appears as a boss in the RPG video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[James Horan (actor)|James Horan]]. He is one of the lieutenants in [[Doctor Doom]]'s Masters of Evil and has various mass-produced clones of himself which serve as foot soldiers during the attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier U.N.N. Alpha. He fights the heroes alongside [[Baron Mordo]] on Raven's Spire.
