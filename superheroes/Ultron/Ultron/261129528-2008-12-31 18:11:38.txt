'''Ultron''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #54 (1968), and was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]].

==Publication history==
===1960s===
Although Ultron first appears in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #54 (1968), the character is disguised for the majority of the issue as the [[Crimson Cowl]], with his face only revealed on the last page of the issue and no name given to the character. The following month, in #55 (Aug. 1968), the character is identified as '''Ultron-5, the living automaton''', although his origin is still unknown. <ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (July - Aug. 1968)</ref> In ''Avengers'' 57 - 58 (Oct-Nov. 1968) in a [[flashback]] sequence it is revealed that Ultron is the creator of the "synthezoid" the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], whom it tries to use as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. The Vision, however, destroys Ultron with the aid of the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' #57 (Oct. 1968)</ref>

Further flashbacks reveal that he is the creation of [[Henry Pym]], and based on Pym's brain patterns. The robot gradually develops its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately suffers from an [[Oedipus Complex]], whereby it feels irrational hatred for his "father" Hank, and demonstrates an interest in Hank's lover Janet van Dyne, [[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]]. Rebuilding itself and upgrading five times, Ultron then [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Pym and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] him into forgetting that the robot had ever existed. <ref>''Seen in flashback in'' ''The Avengers'' #58 (Nov. 1968)</ref>

The character's next appearance is in ''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969), where the character, now referring to itself as Ultron-6, uses the fictional alloy [[adamantium]] to upgrade his body to an an almost indestructible state. Taking the name Ultimate Ultron, its plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969) </ref>

===1970s===
A crossover story between ''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) and ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974) features Ultron (now '''Ultron-7''') attacking the wedding of the Inhuman [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and the Avenger [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] before being destroyed once again.  <ref>''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) & ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> The character next appears in ''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977) as '''Ultron-8''' where it is responsible for the creation of [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] who, it wishes to take as a robotic bride.  <ref>''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977)</ref> Shortly afterwards, in ''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978), the Avengers, with the aid of [[Ms. Marvel]] battle and defeat '''Ultron-9'''. <ref>''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978)</ref>

His next appearances in ''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980) as '''Ultron 10''' and in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92-93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982) as '''Ultron 11''' both feature brainwashed heroes recreating and then defeating the robotic menace. <ref>''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980)</ref> <ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92 – 93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982)</ref> After being briefly recreated (as '''Ultron-11''') by the [[Beyonder]] and appearing on [[Battleworld]] during the [[Secret Wars]]<ref>''Secret Wars'' (May 1984 to April 1985)</ref> and for a brief encounter with the Thing,<ref>''The Thing'' #21 - 22 (March - April 1985)</ref> Ultron is destroyed again. The Thing, however, does bring Ultron's head back to Earth as a souvenir. The head of Ultron-11 is dropped and forgotten by the Thing when there is an attack by the alien [[Dire Wraiths]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #277 (April 1985)</ref>

A new Ultron ('''Ultron-12''') enters into an alliance with the villain the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and his allies ([[Nekra]]; the [[Erik Josten]] Goliath; [[Man-Ape]] and the [[Black Talon]]) in a bid to destroy the Reaper's brother, [[Wonder Man]]. Although the villains are defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]], Ultron-12 begins to form a relationship with his "father", Henry Pym.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 - 2 (Oct. - Nov. 1985) & ''Vision & The Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #2 (Nov. 1985)</ref> Rebuilding itself, Ultron-11 comes into conflict with Hank Pym and Ultron 12. With the assistance of Wonder Man, they destroy Ultron-11. Ultron-12 then deactivates, but tells Pym it was glad it could help save him. <ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #7 (April 1986)</ref>

The next Ultron ('''Ultron-16''') captures the West Coast Avenger [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and using her brain patterns to create a new robotic mate called [[Alkhema]].

''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998) saw a brief cameo for the character as '''Ultron-19''', before appearing fully in ''Avengers'' #10 (Nov. 1998) where he slaughters the population of the fictional state Slorernia before once again being defeated by the Avengers in ''Avengers'' 22 (Nov. 1999).<ref>''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998) & #10 (Nov. 1998)</ref> <ref>''Avengers'' #19 - 22 (Aug. - Nov. 1999)</ref>

===2000s ===
''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #46 - 48 (Nov. 2001 - Jan. 2002) features an Ultron formed from an old version of Iron Man's armour, who leads the cult the [[Sons of Yinsen]] in an attempt to conquest via religion. He is defeated by Iron Man and Jocasta. <ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #46 - 48 (Nov. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref>  Another Ultron creates the [[cyborg]] [[Victor Mancha]], who is to be used as a [[sleeper agent]] against the Avengers. Mancha, however, rebels, and joins the young team the [[Runaways]].<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2, #1 (April 2005)</ref> This Ultron first poses as [[Doctor Doom]] before revealing itself, and is defeated in a battle against the Runaways and the super-team [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]], eventually being destroyed by [[Darkhawk]].<ref>"Runaways" vol. 2, #6 (September 2005)</ref>

In June [[2007]], Marvel launched a new Avengers title called ''[[Mighty Avengers]]''. In the first six issue arc, Ultron interfaces with Iron Man's armor, which Iron Man had integrated with his biology. This allows Ultron's program to transform Iron Man into a new version of Ultron that has the human appearance of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], albeit with a metallic skin. This version is eventually destroyed by new Avenger [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], who uses a computer virus to wipe Ultron's program from Iron Man's armor. Ultron's image later briefly appears on one of Pym's computers. <ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #1 - 5 (June - Oct. 2007)</ref><ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #1 - 5 (June - Oct. 2007)</ref> 

In the [[2008]] ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' crossover, one version of Ultron leads the alien race the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], who view Ultron as the sympathetic father they have yearned for.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=135562 "SPOILER SPORT: ANNIHILATION: CONQUEST #1"]</ref> Together, they invade [[Kree]] space. Taking control of the body of [[Adam Warlock]], Ultron hopes to achieve "true techno-organic perfection", but is evenutally  forced to abandon Warlock's body by [[Warlock (New Mutants)|the technarchy Warlock]]. It is destroyed in combat by  [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]].<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #5 - 6 (May - June 200)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied over his appearances. However, common powers include enhanced strength; flight, and various offensive weapons such as concussion blasters and an "encephalo-ray", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control his victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time.

Ultron's outer armour is unusual in that it is usually composed of primary [[adamantium]], which is almost completely impervious to damage. Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace, and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can beam part or all of Ultron's programming into other computers or alternate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. A recent Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing him to animate and control hundreds of alternate Ultron bodies simultaneously.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #19 - 22 (Aug. - Nov. 1999)</ref> Ultron also uses an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of his workings more malleable and so have the ability to remodel his physical form. What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the Avenger the [[Scarlet Witch]] is capable of causing malfunctions with her hex power.<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Aug. 1977)</ref>
