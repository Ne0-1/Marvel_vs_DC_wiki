'''Ultron''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #54 (1968), and was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]]. 

==Publication history==
===1960s===
Although Ultron first appears in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #54 (1968), the character is disguised for the majority of the issue as the [[Crimson Cowl]], with his face only revealed on the last page of the issue and no name given to the character. The character leads the [[Masters of Evil]] against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In the following issue, #55 (Aug. 1968), the character is identified as '''Ultron-5, the living automaton''', although his origin is still unknown.<ref>''Avengers'' #54 - 55 (July - Aug. 1968)</ref> In ''Avengers'' 57 - 58 (Oct-Nov. 1968) in a [[flashback]] sequence it is revealed that Ultron is the creator of the "synthezoid" the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], whom it tries to use as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. The Vision, however, destroys Ultron with the aid of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #57 (Oct. 1968)</ref>

Further flashbacks reveal that he is the creation of [[Henry Pym]], and based on Pym's brain patterns. The robot gradually developed its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately suffers from an [[Oedipus Complex]], whereby it feels irrational hatred for his "father" Hank, and demonstrates an interest in Hank's lover Janet van Dyne, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. Rebuilding itself and upgrading five times, Ultron then [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Pym and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] him into forgetting that the robot had ever existed. <ref>''Seen in flashback in'' ''The Avengers'' #58 (Nov. 1968)</ref>

The character's next appearance is in ''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969), where the character, now referring to itself as '''Ultron-6''', uses the fictional alloy [[adamantium]] to upgrade his body to an almost indestructible state. Taking the name Ultimate Ultron, its plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #66 – 68 (July – Sept. 1969) </ref>

===1970s===
A crossover story between ''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) and ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974) features Ultron (now '''Ultron-7'''), recreated by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] with the body of the android [[Omega (Marvel Comics)|Omega]], attacking the wedding of the Inhuman [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and the Avenger [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and battling the Avengers, [[Inhumans]], and [[Fantastic Four]] before being destroyed once again.<ref>''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) & ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> The character next appears in ''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977) as '''Ultron-8''' where it is responsible for the creation of [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] whom it wishes to take as a robotic bride.<ref>''Avengers'' #161 – 162 (July – Aug. 1977)</ref> Shortly afterwards, in ''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978), the Avengers, with the aid of [[Ms. Marvel]] battle and defeat '''Ultron-8'''.<ref>''Avengers'' #170 – 171 (April – May 1978)</ref>

===1980s===
His next appearances are in ''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980) as '''Ultron-9''' and in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92-93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982) as '''Ultron-10'''; both appearances feature brainwashed heroes recreating and then defeating the robotic menace.<ref>''Avengers'' #201 – 202 (Nov. – Dec 1980)</ref><ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92 – 93 (Oct. – Nov. 1982)</ref> After being briefly recreated (as '''Ultron-11''') by the [[Beyonder]] and appearing on [[Battleworld]] during the [[Secret Wars]],<ref>''Secret Wars'' (May 1984 to April 1985)</ref> and for a brief encounter with the Thing,<ref>''The Thing'' #21 - 22 (March - April 1985)</ref> Ultron is destroyed again. The Thing, however, does bring Ultron's head back to Earth as a souvenir. The head of Ultron-11 is dropped and forgotten by the Thing when there is an attack by the alien [[Dire Wraiths]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #277 (April 1985)</ref>

A new Ultron ('''Ultron-12''') enters into an alliance with the villain the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and his allies ([[Nekra]]; the [[Erik Josten]] Goliath; [[Man-Ape]] and the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]]) in a bid to destroy the Reaper's brother, [[Wonder Man]]. Although the villains are defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]], Ultron-12 begins to form a relationship with his "father", Henry Pym.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 - 2 (Oct. - Nov. 1985) & ''Vision & The Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #2 (Nov. 1985)</ref> Ultron-12 begins calling itself '''Ultron Mark 12''', in an effort to sound more human.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #6</ref> Rebuilding itself, Ultron-11 comes into conflict with Hank Pym and Ultron-12. With the assistance of Wonder Man, they destroy Ultron-11. Ultron-12 then deactivates, but tells Pym it was glad it could help save him.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #7 (April 1986)</ref>

===1990s===
Ultron appears as a pawn of Doctor Doom; having been rebuilt with all previous personalities active at the same time, resulting in a form of robotic madness. Ultron fights Daredevil before a programming conflict deactivates the robot.<ref>''Daredevil'' #275 - 276 (Dec. - Jan. 1990)</ref>

Another version of Ultron appears ('''Ultron-13''') and is stopped by the ''West Coast Avengers''.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #65 - 68 (Dec. 1990 - Mar. 1991)</ref> After escaping captivity this version attempts to obtain a new form of vibranium called '''Nuform''', but is repelled by the combined efforts of Iron Man, the Black Panther and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #25; ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Annual #11 & ''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #7 (all 1991)</ref> Ultron ('''Ultron-11''') next briefly appears as a captive of a highly advanced [[Doombot]], but is freed when the Doombot is defeated by [[Deathlok]].<ref>''Deathlok'' #2 + 5 (Aug. & Nov. 1991)</ref>

'''Ultron-13''' escapes from prison and upgrades into "The Ultimate Ultron", (technically '''Ultron-14''') and captures the West Coast Avenger [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], using her brain patterns to create a new robotic mate called [[Alkhema]]. Alkhema aids Ultron but both are eventually jettisoned into space through a ruse by the Vision.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #89 - 91 (Dec. 1992 - Feb 1993)</ref> The character reappears with Alkhema, and together they plan to create a "volcanic winter" by placing bombs underneath several [[volcanoes]]. The West Coast Avengers stop the pair once again, and Alkhema rebels and leaves Ultron.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Annual #8 (1993)</ref> Another Ultron ('''Ultron-15''') is found by the Vision, but is discovered to have been "infected" by human emotion and is seriously deteriorating, displaying symptoms that resemble [[alcoholism]]. This Ultron and a recreated Jocasta decide to explore the world with the Vision for a time.<ref>''Vision'' #1 - 4 (Nov. 1994 - Feb. 1995)</ref>
[[Image:IronMan-48.jpg|165px|thumb|left|Ultron takes over Iron Man's armor. Cover of ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #48. (Jan. 2002) Art by Udon.]]
After a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] appearance (as '''Ultron-17''')<ref>''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998)</ref> the character - with the aid of '''Ultron-16''' - slaughters the population of the fictional state Slorenia before once again being defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998) & #10 (Nov. 1998)</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #19 - 22 (Aug. - Nov. 1999)</ref>

===2000s ===
The Avengers discover that every creation of Ultron (Vision, Jocasta, Alkhema) has a secret program included - they are subconsciously compelled to rebuild Ultron. In this case, it is Alkhema who unintentionally rebuilds Ultron when she attempts to create a new species of bio-synthezoids. '''Ultron-18''' was, however, composed of steel, not adamantium, and is destroyed when Alkhema's subterranean base exploded. Ultron's head was recovered by one of the synthezoids, an artificial girl called '''Antigone'''.<ref>''Avengers: the Ultron Imperative'' (Nov. 2001)</ref>

[[Iron Man]] encounters an Ultron formed from an old version of his armor and the head of '''Ultron-18''', who leads the cult the [[Sons of Yinsen]] in an attempt to conquest via [[religion]]. The character is defeated by Iron Man and Jocasta.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #46 - 48 (Nov. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref>  Another Ultron (possibly '''Ultron-13''') creates the [[cyborg]] [[Victor Mancha]], who is to be used as a [[sleeper agent]] against the Avengers. Mancha, however, rebels, and joins the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2, #1 (April 2005)</ref> This Ultron first poses as [[Doctor Doom]] before revealing itself, and is defeated in a battle against the Runaways and [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]].<ref>"Runaways" vol. 2, #6 (Sep. 2005)</ref>

In June [[2007]], Marvel launched a new Avengers title called ''[[Mighty Avengers]]''. In the first six issue arc, Ultron interfaces with Iron Man's armor, which Iron Man had integrated with his biology. This allows Ultron's program to transform Iron Man into a new version of Ultron that has the human appearance of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], albeit with a metallic skin. This version is eventually destroyed by new Avenger [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], who uses a computer virus to wipe Ultron's program from Iron Man's armor. Ultron's image later briefly appears on one of Pym's computers.<ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2007">''Mighty Avengers'' #1 - 6 (June - November. 2007)</ref> 

The ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' limited series features a version of Ultron leading the alien race the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], who view Ultron as the sympathetic father they have yearned for. After invading [[Kree]] space and taking control of the body of [[Adam Warlock]], Ultron hopes to achieve "true techno-organic perfection", but is eventually forced to abandon Warlock's body by [[Warlock (New Mutants)|the Technarchy Warlock]]. It is destroyed in combat by [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]].<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #1 - 6 (Aug. 2007 - May 2008:bi-monthly)</ref>

In the limited series ''Avengers/[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', it is revealed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[life model decoy]]s have been partly replaced with versions of Ultron. When the original Human Torch appears in the present they covertly parasitize his unique android physiology and become more human. The combined super teams, however, discover the plan and destroy the androids.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #7 - 8 (Feb. - Mar. 2009). Issues #1 - 12 (July 2008 - Aug. 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors and hands, and an "encephalo-ray", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.

Ultron's outer armor is usually composed of primary [[adamantium]], which is almost completely impervious to damage. Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace, and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can beam part or all of Ultron's memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including tractor beam apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of alternate Ultron bodies simultaneously.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #19 - 22 (Aug. - Nov. 1999)</ref> Ultron also uses an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its' workings more malleable and so have the ability to restructure his physical form. What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the [[Scarlet Witch]] is capable of causing malfunctions with her hex power.<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Aug. 1977)</ref>

==Other versions==
The [[Fantastic Four]] storyline "Death of The Invisible Woman" features an advanced humanoid called '''Alex Ultron''' a member of the futuristic''The Last Defenders''.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #559 (Sep. 2008)</ref> In the [[Marvel Adventures]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] universe, Ultron is a highly-intelligent "neural network" that controls a section of the United States defense forces.<ref>''Giant-Size Marvel Adventures: The Avengers'' #1 (Sep. 2007)</ref> The title ''[[Avengers Next]]'', set in yet another alternate universe, features an upgraded version of Ultron named Ultron Extreme.<ref>''Avengers Next'' #2 - 3 (Nov. - Dec. 1998)</ref>

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint]] title the ''[[Ultimates]]'', Ultron is the name of a group of robots designed to be expendable super soldiers. They are created by [[Henry Pym#Ultimate Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] along with a partner robot called "Vision II''.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #10 - 13 (Dec 2004 - May 2007)</ref> The Ultron robots reappear as butlers to the Ultimates, with one unit developing an independent mind and emotions as a result of a chance encounter with the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #6 (July 2005)</ref> This Ultron eventually impersonates Henry Pym in the persona of Yellowjacket, creates android duplicates of the Ultimates, and is responsible for the assassination of the Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #1 - 4 (Feb. - May 2008); #5 (Nov. 2008)</ref>

The limited series ''[[The Last Avengers Story]]'' features a possible future in which '''Ultron-59''' manipulates fellow Avengers foe [[Kang the Conqueror]] into attacking the Avengers. Ultron is destroyed by the Vision, who sacrifices his own artificial life.<ref>''The Last Avengers Story'' #1 - 2 (Nov. - Dec. 1995)</ref>
