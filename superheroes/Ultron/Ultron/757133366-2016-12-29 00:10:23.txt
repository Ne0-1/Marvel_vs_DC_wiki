'''Ultron''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is most recognized as a foe of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and has a quasi-familial relationship with several of their members, especially his creator [[Hank Pym]]. He was the first Marvel Comics character to wield the fictitious metal alloy [[adamantium]].<ref name="Back38">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 23–30|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Ultron has appeared in several media adaptations, including animated television series, an animated film, and video games. The character is portrayed by actor [[James Spader]] in the 2015 film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name=AvengersAOU />

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=May 2014}}
The character initially appeared as an unnamed character in a cameo in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #54 (1968), with a first full appearance in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #55 (1968). Ultron was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]]. Thomas, who has acknowledged he finds naming characters difficult, said he liked the -tron suffix and went from there.<ref name="HollywoodReporter">[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/age-ultron-creator-roy-thomas-791320 The Hollywood Reporter: "Marvel Legend Reveals What Stan Lee Initially "Hated" About 'Age of Ultron' Breakout"]</ref>

Thomas said the idea of the character and his appearance were heavily based on Makino, an obscure robotic villain who appeared in an issue of the ''[[Captain Video]]'' comic book.<ref name="Back38"/> He liked the robot's malicious looking smile, and showed it to Buscema.<ref name="HollywoodReporter"/>

==Fictional character biography==

===1960s===
Although Ultron first appears in ''Avengers'' #54 (1968), the character is disguised for the majority of the issue as the "'''[[Crimson Cowl]]'''", with his face only revealed on the last page of the issue and no name given to the character. The character leads the [[Masters of Evil]] against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], having hypnotized [[Edwin Jarvis]] into working for him. In the following issue, ''Avengers'' #55 (August 1968), the character is identified as '''Ultron-5, The Living Automaton'''.<ref>''Avengers'' #54&ndash;55 (July&ndash;August 1968)</ref> In ''Avengers'' 57–58 (October–November 1968), a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence revealed that Ultron is the creator of the "synthezoid" [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. The Vision—having [[Wonder Man]]'s brain patterns—destroys Ultron with the aid of the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #57 (October 1968)</ref>

Further flashbacks reveal that Ultron is the creation of [[Hank Pym]], and is based on Pym's brain patterns. The robot gradually developed its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately develops an [[Oedipus Complex]], whereby it feels irrational hatred for his "father" Hank, and demonstrates an interest in the [[Janet van Dyne|Wasp]] (Janet van Dyne). Rebuilding itself, learning how to turn itself on, and upgrading five times, Ultron then [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] and [[brainwashing|brainwashes]] Pym into forgetting that the robot had ever existed.<ref>''The Avengers'' #58 (Nov. 1968)</ref>

The character's next appearance is in ''Avengers'' #66–68 (July–September 1969), where the character, now referring to itself as '''Ultron-6''', uses the fictional alloy [[adamantium]] to upgrade its body to an almost indestructible state and takes the new name '''Ultimate Ultron'''. Its plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #66&ndash;68 (July&ndash;September 1969)</ref>

===1970s===
A crossover story between ''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) and ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974) features Ultron (now '''Ultron-7'''), recreated by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] with the body of the android [[Omega (Marvel Comics)|Omega]], attacking the wedding of the Inhuman [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and the Avenger [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and battling the Avengers, [[Inhumans]], and [[Fantastic Four]] before being destroyed once again.<ref>''Avengers'' #127 (Sept. 1974) & ''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> The character next appears in ''Avengers'' #161&ndash;162 (July&ndash;Aug. 1977) as '''Ultron-8''' where it is responsible for the creation of [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] as a robotic bride.<ref>''Avengers'' #161&ndash;162 (July&ndash;Aug. 1977)</ref> Shortly afterwards, in ''Avengers'' #170&ndash;171 (April&ndash;May 1978), the Avengers, with the aid of [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] battle and defeat Ultron-8.<ref>''Avengers'' #170&ndash;171 (April&ndash;May 1978)</ref>

===1980s===
His next appearances are in ''Avengers'' #201–202 (Nov.–Dec 1980) as '''Ultron-9''' and in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92–93 (Oct.–Nov. 1982) as '''Ultron-10'''; both appearances feature brainwashed heroes re-creating and then defeating the robotic menace.<ref>''Avengers'' #201&ndash;202 (Nov.&ndash;Dec 1980)</ref><ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #92&ndash;93 (Oct.&ndash;Nov. 1982)</ref> After being briefly recreated (as '''Ultron-11''') by the [[Beyonder]] and appearing on Battleworld during the [[Secret Wars]],<ref>''Secret Wars'' (May 1984 to April 1985)</ref> and for a brief encounter with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]],<ref>''The Thing'' #21&ndash;22 (March&ndash;April 1985)</ref> Ultron is destroyed again. The Thing, however, does bring Ultron's head back to Earth as a souvenir. The head of Ultron-11 is dropped and forgotten by the Thing when there is an attack by the alien [[Dire Wraiths]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #277 (April 1985)</ref>

A new Ultron ('''Ultron-12''') enters into an alliance with the villain the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and his allies ([[Nekra]]; the [[Erik Josten]] Goliath; [[Man-Ape]] and the [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]]) in a bid to destroy the Grim Reaper's brother [[Wonder Man]]. Although the villains are defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]], Ultron-12 begins to form a relationship with his "father" Henry Pym.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2 #1&ndash;2 (Oct.&ndash;Nov. 1985) and ''Vision & The Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2, #2 (Nov. 1985)</ref> Ultron-12 begins calling itself '''Ultron Mark 12''', in an effort to sound more human.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #6</ref> Rebuilding itself, Ultron-11 comes into conflict with Hank and Ultron-12. With the assistance of Wonder Man, they destroy Ultron-11. Ultron-12 then deactivates, but tells Pym it was glad it could help save him.<ref name="West Coast Avengers' 1986">''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #7 (April 1986)</ref>

===1990s===
[[Doctor Doom]] rebuilds Ultron using a combination of all of Ultron's previous personalities with a particularly strong dose of Ultron-12, believing this mix will make Ultron subservient to him. Instead, all 12 Ultrons coexist as separate personalities, resulting in a form of madness which culminates with Ultron-12 [[self-mutilation|mutilating himself]] in an attempt to remove some of his other personalities. [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] destroy Ultron by severing his neck cables.<ref>''Daredevil'' #275&ndash;276 (Dec. &ndash; Jan. 1990)</ref>

Another version of Ultron ('''Ultron-13''') appears and is stopped by the West Coast Avengers.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #65 - 68 (Dec. 1990 &ndash; Mar. 1991)</ref> After escaping captivity, this version attempts to obtain a new form of [[vibranium]] called '''Nuform''', but is repelled by the combined efforts of [[Iron Man]], the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #25, ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' Annual #11, and ''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #7 (1991)</ref> Ultron (Ultron-11) next briefly appears as a captive of a highly advanced [[Doombot]], but is freed when the Doombot is defeated by [[Deathlok]].<ref>''Deathlok'' #2, 5 (Aug. and Nov. 1991)</ref>

Ultron-13 escapes from prison and upgrades into the '''Ultimate Ultron''' (technically '''Ultron-14'''), and captures the West Coast Avenger [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] to use Mockingbird's brain patterns to create the new robotic mate [[Alkhema]]. Alkhema aids Ultron but both are eventually jettisoned into space through a ruse by the Vision.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #89&ndash;91 (Dec. 1992 &ndash; Feb 1993)</ref> The character reappears with Alkhema, and together they plan to create a "volcanic winter" by placing bombs underneath several [[volcanoes]]. The West Coast Avengers stop the pair once again, and Alkhema rebels and leaves Ultron.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Annual #8 (1993)</ref> Another Ultron ('''Ultron-15''') is found by the Vision, but is discovered to have been "infected" by human emotion and is seriously deteriorating, displaying symptoms that resemble [[alcoholism]]. This Ultron and a recreated Jocasta decide to explore the world with the Vision for a time.<ref>''Vision'' #1&ndash;4 (Nov. 1994 &ndash; Feb. 1995)</ref>
[[Image:IronMan-48.jpg|165px|thumb|left|Ultron takes over Iron Man's armor. Cover of ''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #48. (Jan. 2002) Art by Udon.]]
After a brief [[cameo appearance]] (as '''Ultron-17''')<ref>''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998)</ref> the character - with the aid of '''Ultron-16''' - slaughters the population of the fictional state Slorenia before once again being defeated by the Avengers, Goliath using vibranium against him.<ref>''Avengers'' #0 (Feb. 1998) and #10 (Nov. 1998)</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #19&ndash;22 (Aug.&ndash;Nov. 1999)</ref>

===2000s===
The Avengers discovered that every creation of Ultron (Vision, Jocasta and Alkhema) has a secret program included - they are subconsciously compelled to rebuild Ultron. In this case, it is Alkhema who unintentionally rebuilds Ultron when she attempts to create a new species of bio-synthezoids. '''Ultron-18''' was, however, composed of steel, not adamantium, and is destroyed when Alkhema's subterranean base exploded after [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] shot Alkhema with a vibranium arrow at Alkhema's request. Ultron's head was recovered by one of the synthezoids, an artificial girl called '''Antigone'''.<ref>''Avengers: the Ultron Imperative'' (Nov. 2001)</ref>

Iron Man encounters an Ultron formed from an old version of his armor and the head of Ultron-18 that leads the cult the [[Sons of Yinsen]] in an attempt to conquest via [[religion]]. The character is defeated by Iron Man and Jocasta.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #46&ndash;48 (Nov. 2001 &ndash; Jan. 2002)</ref> Another Ultron (possibly Ultron-13) creates the [[cyborg]] [[Victor Mancha]] as a [[sleeper agent]] against the Avengers. Mancha, however, rebels, and joins the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]].<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #1 (April 2005)</ref> This Ultron first poses as "[[Doctor Doom]]" before revealing itself, and is defeated in a battle against the Runaways and [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]].<ref>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #6 (Sep. 2005)</ref>
[[Image:Femaleultron.PNG|165px|thumb|right|The female Ultron, as seen on the cover for ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' #2 (July 2007) Art by [[Frank Cho]].]]
In June 2007, Marvel launched a new Avengers title called ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Frank Cho]]. In the first six issue arc, Ultron interfaces with Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor|armor]], which had been integrated with Tony Stark's biology. This allows Ultron's program to transform Iron Man into a new version of Ultron who has the appearance of the human Wasp albeit with a metallic skin. This version takes control of Stark's technology. He kills the Sentry's wife, causing the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] to battle Ultron, nearly tearing his head off. This version is eventually destroyed by new Avenger [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] using a computer virus (created by the Skrull agent Criti-Noll impersonating Henry Pym) to wipe Ultron's program from Iron Man's armor, changing Stark back to normal. Ultron's image later briefly appears on one of Pym's computers.<ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2007">''Mighty Avengers'' #1&ndash;6 (June&ndash;November. 2007)</ref>

However, this was not the end of Ultron, for his disembodied consciousness was thrown into the depths of space. He spent a few months floating through the cosmos as radio-waves and energy. Eventually his signal was picked up by an outlying group of [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], who were attempting to contact their parent race, the Technarchy. Fascinated by what he found, Ultron decided that the Phalanx lacked direction from a singular consciousness, and that he would be perfect for the role. Through sheer force of will he merged himself with the programming of the Phalanx. In turn, they viewed Ultron as the sympathetic father they had yearned for. Under Ultron’s guidance the Phalanx began the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' by invading the [[Kree]] space. Later by taking control of the body of [[Adam Warlock]], Ultron hopes to achieve "true techno-organic perfection", but is eventually forced to abandon Warlock's body by the Technarchy [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] and is later destroyed in combat by [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]].<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #1&ndash;6 (Aug. 2007 &ndash; May 2008:bi-monthly)</ref>

In the limited series ''Avengers/[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', it is revealed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[life model decoy]]s have been partly replaced with versions of Ultron. When the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] appears in the present they covertly parasitize his unique android physiology and become more human. The combined super teams (but mainly the Human Torch himself), however, discover the plan and destroy the androids.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #7&ndash;8 (Feb.&ndash;Mar. 2009). Issues #1&ndash;12 (July 2008 &ndash; Aug. 2009)</ref>

===2010s===
In the ''Mighty Avengers'', Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself '''Ultron Pym''' and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #35 (Mar. 2010)</ref> Pym eventually offers Ultron a compromise, allowing Jocasta to become Ultron's bride, on the condition that Ultron banishes himself to ultraspace. Ultron agrees, but warns that he will be ruler of all someday.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #36 (April 2010)</ref>

In ''The Avengers'', the team visits a possible future in which almost all of humanity is destroyed by Ultron. [[Kang the Conqueror]] attempts to enlist them to defeat his robotic foe, but another group of heroes and villains, plucked from all over time and space ends up destroying this Ultron.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4, #1&ndash;6 (Jul.&ndash;Dec. 2010)</ref>

Later, also in ''Avengers'', the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]], a cabal of super-intelligent supervillains, discover the inert body of a Galadorian Spaceknight and attempt to reactivate its powersource, hoping to exploit it. Although the Avengers interrupt their attempts, the body activates, revealing it contains the consciousness of Ultron, who had escaped destruction after the events of ''Annihilation: Conquest''. The new Ultron escapes and Iron Man gravely foresees that when he returns, it will bring the apocalypse for humanity.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 4, #12.1 (Jun. 2011)</ref>

During the "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline, which takes place in an alternate universe, Ultron has returned and conquers the world while slowly remolding it into his image. His Ultron Sentinels are guarding the streets looking for any fugitives. Hawkeye runs into the Ultron Sentinels as he was rescuing the [[The Superior Spider-Man]] yet manages to destroy the Ultron Sentinels present.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Bryan Hitch|Hitch, Bryan]]|inker= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|title= Age of Ultron|issue= 1|date= May 2013}}</ref> It is later revealed that Ultron is actually in the future and has been using Vision as a conduit to punish humanity.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Hitch, Bryan|inker= Neary, Paul|title= Age of Ultron|issue= 4|date= June 2013}}</ref> While one strike team travels into the future to fight Ultron, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the [[Invisible Woman]] go back in time to kill Pym before he can create Ultron in the first place.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #6</ref> This results in a world where Tony Stark controls an army of robotic drones and [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] has conquered half of the world.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #7</ref> Traveling back in time once more, Wolverine succeeds in stopping himself from killing Pym, and he, Pym and Susan Storm come up with a different plan. This plan results in a different outcome of the prior confrontation between the Avengers and the Intelligencia - a 'back door' installed into Ultron at his original creation allows Hank Pym and Iron Man to destroy the robot, instead, averting the events that led to the 'Age of Ultron'.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #8&ndash;10</ref>

It is later revealed that years earlier, the Avengers had trapped an unidentified iteration of Ultron in deep space after sealing him inside a [[vibranium]] [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]]. In the present, the Quinjet crash lands on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], freeing Ultron. By hijacking the [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]] computer, he transforms Titan into Planet Ultron, and launches a plan to infect the entire universe with a [[nanite]] virus that transforms organic creatures into Ultron drones. The ensuing confrontation with the Avengers leads to Ultron inadvertently merging with Pym, transforming him into a human/machine hybrid, the resulting creation playing on Hank's self-loathing of his own human weakness to cause him to accept his new state. He is defeated when [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] uses his powers to force Ultron to love himself, causing the part of Ultron that is now Hank to accept his old weakness and flaws while the villain has a mental breakdown and flees into space.<ref>''Avengers: Rage of Ultron''</ref>

As part of the [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] branding, the Hank Pym/Ultron resurfaced. While on his way back to Earth, the Hank Pym/Ultron helped the crew of a spaceship that was being attacked by a hostile insectoid alien. After coming aboard the spaceship, Hank Pym introduced himself as well as his "friend" Ultron to the crew.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> He later returns to Earth, where Wasp and Captain America discover that Ultron has taken complete control and is using Hank Pym's face to fool his old friends.{{issue|date=July 2016}} After Ultron incapacitates Deadpool, Cable, and the Human Torch,  Wasp initiates the Icarus Protocol and Iron Man is called in to help stop Ultron with the aid of the Hulkbuster Armor.{{issue|date=July 2016}} The Avengers end up defeating him by plunging him into the sun, but both Hank and Ultron survive and continue to do battle with one another internally.{{issue|date=September 2016}}

==Powers and abilities==
The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors or hands and an "encephalo-ray", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.

Ultron's outer armor is usually composed primarily of adamantium, which is almost completely impervious to damage (the first use of the term "adamantium" in Marvel Comics was made in reference to Ultron in Avengers #66, published in July 1969). Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can beam part or all of Ultron's memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including tractor beam apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of other Ultron bodies simultaneously,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #19&ndash;22 (Aug.&ndash;Nov. 1999)</ref> although only the 'prime' Ultron was composed of adamantium while others were made of steel or secondary adamantium due to the lack of resources to give all the Ultrons adamantium bodies.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #22 (Nov. 1999)</ref> Ultron also uses an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its workings more malleable and so has the ability to restructure its physical form. What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the [[Scarlet Witch]] is capable of causing malfunctions with her hex power,<ref>''Avengers'' #162 (Aug. 1977)</ref> [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], using his nova burst, managed to damage Ultron's internal circuits while its outer armor remained intact,<ref>''Secret Wars'' #12</ref> and [[Wonder Man]] was once able to destroy an Ultron by throwing it so hard its internal systems were damaged.<ref name="West Coast Avengers' 1986"/>
