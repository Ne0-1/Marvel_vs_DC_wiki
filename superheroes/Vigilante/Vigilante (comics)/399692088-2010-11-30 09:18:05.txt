The original Vigilante was a western-themed hero who debuted in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #42 (November 1941). The origin of the Vigilante was straightforward, as was typical of 1940's mystery men. '''Greg Sanders'''' (the spelling was changed to "'''Saunders'''" in the 1990s) grandfather was an Indian fighter, and his father was a sheriff in Wyoming. As a young man, Saunders moved east to New York City and became a country singer, radio's "Prairie Troubadour". Greg returned to his home after his father was killed, bringing to justice the gang of bandits who killed the sheriff during a stagecoach hold-up. Afterwards Saunders devoted his life to battling criminals in the same manner, taking the Western-themed identity of the Vigilante. A slight revision to this came a few months later, when it was explained that the stagecoach was used to transport gold from a mine, and that the bandits were actually Easterners, since the idea of a stagecoach heist in modern times was improbable.

The Vigilante, like many heroes of the era, acquired a sidekick to aid him in his crime fighting. [[Stuff the Chinatown Kid]], was introduced in ''Action Comics'' #45. He assisted the Vigilante when a Japanese spy known as the Head framed Stuff's grandfather for provoking a [[Tong]] war. Stuff worked with the Vigilante until his apparent retirement.  

The majority of the Vigilante's solo adventures were against non-powered, costumed criminals. He was an excellent brawler, trick shooter, sharpshooter, horseman and motorcycle rider, and an expert with the lariat. These skills gave him advantage over his adversaries in his adventures, which centered primarily in New York City. 

The Vigilante fought few foes that could be considered real "super-villains". His arch-foes were the [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]], a brilliant weapons inventor and professional killer who resembled a ventriloquist's dummy in both size and facial features, and the Rainbow Man, who committed crimes with a color motif. The Vigilante also encountered The Rattler on several occasions, as well as The Fiddler and The Shade, though the latter two villains are not the same foes that battled the [[The Flash#Golden Age Flash .28Jay Garrick.29|Golden Age Flash]].

The Vigilante was also a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] (also known as the Law's Legionnaires), one of the earliest super-hero teams (appearing in ''Leading Comics''). In these adventures, his sidekick Stuff never appeared, being replaced by an old, somewhat crotchety man named Billy Gunn. The Vigilante was also one of the few super-hero features to survive the end of the "Golden Age" of super-hero comics, lasting as a solo feature until ''Action Comics'' #198 (1954), when he was permanently replaced by [[Tommy Tomorrow]].  

The Vigilante was revived in the seventies in the pages of [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], when the Seven Soldiers of Victory were brought back into active continuity.  Like Green Arrow, his Earth-2 counterpart was a lost member of the Seven Soldiers, but he did not participate in the JLA/JSA quest to rescue them.  The Earth-1 Vigilante's contact with the League was limited to a two-part story where he aided the JLA against aliens determined to over-pollute the Earth.  He remarks in his first appearance in ''Adventure Comics'' that the League did help him re-establish his career, even providing him with a new motorcycle.  ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #214 had him teaming up with, and saving the life, of [[Superman]] (his marksmanship allowed him to shoot a silver bullet at the shadow of a werewolf who, being a magical creature, was about to kill the Man of Steel).  He also received a periodic feature in the pages of ''Adventure Comics'', drawn by both [[Mike Sekowsky]] and [[Gray Morrow]], and also in ''World's Finest Comics''.  

The short-lived series in World's Finest culminated in the Vigilante coming to Gotham City to meet his old partner Stuff, only to find his friend murdered by his old enemy, the Dummy. At the end of this series, The Vigilante rode off with Stuff's son (who had been trained by [[Richard Dragon]]).

Vigilante continued to sporadically appear as a superhero in [[DC comics]] until recently, having been established as running a [[dude ranch]] in Mesa City (the former home of Western hero [[Johnny Thunder]]). 

===''Seven Soldiers''===
{{main|Seven Soldiers}}
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''Seven Soldiers'' # 0, the Vigilante establishes a new Seven Soldiers of Victory to battle the monstrous spider of Miracle Mesa. He is apparently killed alongside the rest of the team, only to re-appear as a ghost in ''[[Bulleteer]]'' # 3 (also part of the Seven Soldiers series). He attempts to recruit a new team of seven to further battle the threat of the Sheeda. He claims Bulleteer's actions will allow him to 'rest'.

===Return===
In ''[[Jimmy Olsen|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' (oneshot, Dec 2008) Greg Saunders appears, alive, as the sheriff of Warpath, a town on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border formerly known for supervillain activity. Olsen's narration notes that Saunders has been dead and came back to life, but does not go into detail. Olsen also notes that Saunders appears younger, though he clearly retains all of his past experience.

===Adrian Chase, Alan Welles, Dave Winston===
[[File:Vigilante17alanmoore.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Cover of ''Vigilante'' #17.]]
The character was revived and updated in 1983's ''[[Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]] Annual'' #2 by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Pérez]].

His identity this time was '''Adrian Chase''', a [[New York]] [[district attorney]] whose family was killed by mobsters. This caused Chase to seek justice in his own way as the Vigilante. The character was one of the first amoral characters in American comic books, influenced by the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] from [[Marvel Comics]] and [[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]] series of novels.

After his initial appearance he gained his own ongoing series, initially written by Wolfman, and later included writers such as [[Alan Moore]] and [[Paul Kupperberg]]. In the early issues of the series, it was shown that Adrian took pains to make sure he did not kill his enemies (unlike the Punisher) - he would regularly use non-lethal weaponry to disable his opponents. However, in issue 37, Vigilante allowed a police officer to die as a direct result of his actions. Vigilante then became more violent and cared less about who was caught in the crossfire.

Throughout the series Chase  was tormented over the justice of his actions and the pain it had brought to others. As early as the second issue of the series Chase flirted with abandoning his costumed identity after he savagely beat an ex-convict who turned out to be innocent. Eventually Chase abandoned his identity as Vigilante, believing that he could be both more effective and also happier as a judge. However, during his absence the identity of Vigilante was assumed, in succession, by two of his friends without his knowledge.

The first of these was fellow judge '''Alan Welles''', who operated in a much more violent manner, even executing petty thieves. Chase eventually tracked down and killed this incarnation of Vigilante, without realizing it was his friend. The incident led to increased guilt on Chase's part and also increased scrutiny from a law enforcement task force headed by [[Harry Stein (comics)|Harry Stein]], as he attempted to cover up Alan Welles' role as Vigilante.  

Shortly after this '''Dave Winston''', Adrian Chase's bailiff assumed the Vigilante identity.  Refusing to kill, Winston traded on the fierce reputation of Vigilante to intimidate information out of thugs. He was murdered by [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] while attempting to stop the hijacking of a plane which Chase was on. In the wake of Winston's death, Chase once again assumed the role of Vigilante, feeling that it was the only way to protect those he loved. Seeking revenge on Peacemaker, the out of shape Chase was beaten in a fight and unmasked on live TV, thereby ending his secret identity and forcing him even further into the role of Vigilante.  

As the series progressed Chase became ever more conflicted over his role as Vigilante, the violence he engaged in, and the harm he caused to those around him. He also became increasingly mentally unstable—alternating between bouts of enraged violence, paranoia, and terrible remorse for his actions. Near the end, he even resorted to murdering innocent police officers who got in his way. His mounting guilt culminated in the final issue of his series (#50) where, after contemplating the course of his life, Chase committed suicide.

Before his death, he frequently battled [[Cannon and Saber]] and [[Electrocutioner]].

Adrian makes an appearance in the [[Day of Judgement (comics)|Day of Judgement]] limited series, as one of the dead heroes in Purgatory. He and the others run interference, battling the guardians of the realm, so other living heroes can escape with the soul of Hal Jordan. As stated in issue #5 of the limited series, Adrian's rebellious battle against the guardians earns their 'cases' review by Heavenly.

===Pat Trayce===
The next Vigilante was '''Patricia Trayce''', a rogue [[Gotham City]] police detective who teams up with Deathstroke the Terminator in the ''[[Deathstroke the Terminator]]'' series written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Pérez]].  Trayce found the gear of the second Vigilante (Adrian Chase) and adapted the guise.  She was also Deathstroke's lover. She first appeared in ''Deathstroke the Terminator'' #6. In ''Deathstroke the Terminator'' #11, Pat Trayce takes up the uniform of the Vigilante. She was trained by Deathstroke, and soon started to work alone

===Justin Powell===
Late in 2005, DC published a Vigilante limited series by writer [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and artist [[Ben Oliver]].  The identity of the title character is initially left mysterious, but apparently this is a new incarnation of the character.

His name was '''Justin "Jay" Sutter'''. When he encountered a murderer as a child, he created a second personality in his mind, The Vigilante. Jay at some point changed his name to '''Justin Scott Powell''' and would become the Vigilante subconsciously. While Powell was unaware of the Vigilante personality, the Vigilante knew about Powell.  At the end of the miniseries, Powell was able to reconcile the two personalities.

This Vigilante was last seen, alongside [[Wild Dog (comics)|Wild Dog]] and the current [[Crimson Avenger]], on a rooftop in the great [[battle of Metropolis]], raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], the [[Madmen (DC Comics)|Madmen]], the second Spellbinder, and others in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7.

===Dorian Chase===
The most recent Vigilante appeared in ''[[Nightwing]]'' #133-137. While he wears a costume similar to Adrian Chase's, it is a new vigilante under the mask.  Note that Marv Wolfman has pointed out the "321 Days" arc was cut short by two issues due to [[Batman R.I.P.]] which required the ''Nightwing'' title to feature in it, so the final story as seen ended without any clear closure for any of the characters.

This Vigilante also appears in ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', set after his initial encounter with Nightwing. He is shown to be a formidable fighter, but is defeated easily by [[Batman]]. 

Following the events of Vigilante #1 (February, 2009), the new Vigilante is seen out of costume for the first time and is referred to by his ally JJ as "Dorian." He initially operates under the identity of Joe Flynn, a small time criminal with a rap sheet, but it is later revealed that the real Joe Flynn is dead.  Dorian has the technology to graft another person's face to his own and his assistant changes the police records so his fingerprint and DNA point back to his fake identity.  At the end of the first story arc, Dorian abandons the Joe Flynn identity and begins to make preparations to assume a new identity of a dead and forgotten criminal.  It is also revealed that Dorian is the brother of the late Adrian Chase in Vigilante #9.  Little is known about his past, but his wife is dead and he served time in prison for his work with the mob.

At one point, JJ warns Vigilante about the dangers of pushing himself to the point of destruction, commenting that he "saw it happen" with Adrian Chase. Vigilante describes his predecessor as a fool.

This Vigilante plays an important role in the "Deathtrap" crossover with the [[Teen Titans]] and the [[Teen Titans|Titans]]. He targets the unbalanced [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] for assassination, bringing him into conflict with the various heroes. Vigilante succeeds in tracking down Jericho but, having promised Rose Wilson not to kill him, instead gouges Jericho's eyes out to stop him from using his powers.

The Vigilante had been operating unseen in Europe for several years before moving back to the U.S. and going after local mobs and criminals.

==Other versions==
*Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], there were both an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-1 and an Earth-2]] Vigilante. Both were Greg Saunders from their respective Earths. Earth-1's Vigilante was shown for the first time in the pages (and cover) of the JLA issue where the superteam moved to their classic headquarters on an orbiting satellite (Justice League of America volume 1 # 78).
*In ''[[Detective Comics]] ''#493 it was revealed that Greg Saunders had a nephew, Michael Carter, who became a costumed crimefighter too, the [[Swashbuckler (comics)|Swashbuckler]].
*In the series [[Kingdom Come (comic book series)|''Kingdom Come'']], artist and writer [[Alex Ross]] portrays the cowboy version of the Vigilante fighting alongside the rogue metahumans as a  [[steampunk]]  [[cyborg]] with a [[pinwheel]]/[[steam engine]] arm with a [[gatling gun]] on the end.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:Vigilante.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Vigilante in the episode "Patriot Act" in ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]
*The original Vigilante, Greg Saunders, appears in the series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', in the traditional cowboy-style hat, costume and red neckscarf mask. He made several non-speaking appearances but made three speaking appearances in the episodes "Task Force X", "Hunter's Moon" and "Patriot Act." He was voiced by an uncredited [[Michael Rosenbaum]] in "Task Force X" and then was later voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]] in the following episodes. This version of Vigilante rides a motorcycle and appears to use a special pair of revolvers that never run out of ammo. There was a suggestion that he, like his comic book counterpart, is a country singer, as he claims to play the guitar in the episode "Patriot Act". He was usually paired with [[Shining Knight]], as they were close friends, despite the differences between their lone wolf and chivalrous attitudes. In "Hunter's Moon", Vigilante mentions that he was imprisoned by the [[Thanagar|Thanagarians]] during their invasion, which temporarily brought him at odds with [[Hawkgirl]], who was leading the mission in the episode. In "Patriot Act", Vigilante was apart of the team that paid a homage to [[Seven Soldiers of Victory|The Seven Soldiers of Victory]] when he and his other teammates, one of them including Shining Knight, were faced against [[General Wade Eiling]].

===Film===
*In [[1947 in film|1947]] [[Columbia Pictures]] released a 15-chapter serial loosely based on the original Greg Sanders character, called ''[[The Vigilante]]''. It starred [[Ralph Byrd]] in the title role but changed several aspects. In the serial, The Vigilante is a masked government agent undercover as a playboy actor starring in Westerns. His mission in the serial is to investigate the disappearance, and possible smuggling into America, of a string of rare blood red pearls. The costume has been slightly changed as well but The Vigilante still rides a motorcycle and wields a gun. This serial makes Vigilante one of the first DC Comics characters adapted to live action film (along with [[Congo Bill]], the same year). [[Batman (serial)|Batman]] was adapted into a serial in [[1943 in film|1943]] and [[Hop Harrigan]] in [[1946 in film|1946]], but ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' was not made until [[1948 in film|1948]]. The [[Fawcett Comics]] characters, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Spy Smasher (serial)|Spy Smasher]], which were later bought by DC, had serials in [[1941 in film|1941]] and [[1942 in film|1942]] respective.

*Vigilante makes a brief cameo appearance in the film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''.
