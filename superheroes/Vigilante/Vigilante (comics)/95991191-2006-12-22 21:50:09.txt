The original Vigilante was a western-themed hero who debuted in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #42 (November 1941). The origin of the Vigilante was fairly straightforward, as was typical of 1940's mystery men. '''Greg Sanders''' (the spelling was changed to "'''Saunders'''" in the 1990's) grandfather was an Indian fighter, and his father was a sheriff in Wyoming. As a young man, he moved east to New York City and became a country singer, radio's "Prairie Troubadour". Greg returned to his home after his father was killed, bringing to justice the gang of bandits that had killed the sheriff during a stagecoach hold-up, afterwards devoting his life to battling criminals in the same manner, taking the Western-themed identity of the Vigilante. One slight revision to this came a few months later, when it was explained that the stagecoach was used to transport gold from a mine, and that the bandits were actually Easterners, since the idea of a stagecoach heist in modern times was a little absurd.

The Vigilante, like many heroes of the era, acquired a sidekick to aid him in his crime fighting. [[Stuff the Chinatown Kid]], was introduced in ''Action Comics'' #45. He assisted the Vigilante when a Japanese spy known as the Head framed his grandfather for provoking a Tong war. Stuff worked with the Vigilante until his apparent retirement.  

For the most part, the Vigilante's solo adventures were pretty down-to-earth. He was an excellent brawler, trick shooter, sharpshooter, horseman and motorcycle rider, and an expert with the lariat, all skills that put him to great advantage over his adversaries in his entertaining, but often-mundane adventures, which centered primarily in New York City. 

The Vigilante fought few foes that could be considered real "super-villains". His arch-foes were the [[Dummy (DC Comics)|Dummy]], a brilliant weapons inventor and professional killer who resembled a ventriloquist's dummy in both size and facial features, and the Rainbow Man, who always committed crimes with some sort of a color motif. He also encountered The Rattler on several occasions, as well as The Fiddler and The Shade, though the latter two villains are not the same foes that battled the [[The Flash#Golden Age Flash .28Jay Garrick.29|Golden Age Flash]].

The Vigilante was also a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] (also known as the Law's Legionnaires), one of the earliest super-hero teams (appearing in ''Leading Comics''). In these adventures, his sidekick Stuff never appeared, being replaced by an old, somewhat crotchety man named Billy Gunn. The Vigilante was also one of the few super-hero features to survive the end of the "Golden Age" of super-hero comics, lasting as a solo feature until ''Action Comics'' #198 (1954), when he was permanently replaced by [[Tommy Tomorrow]].  

The Vigilante was revived in the seventies in the pages of [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], when the Seven Soldiers of Victory were brought back into active continuity.  ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #214 had him teaming up with, and saving the life, of [[Superman]].  He also got a periodic feature in the pages of ''Adventure Comics'', drawn by both [[Mike Sekowsky]] and [[Gray Morrow]], and also in ''World's Finest Comics''.  

The short-lived series in World's Finest culminated in the Vigilante coming to Gotham City to meet his old partner Stuff, only to find his friend murdered by his old enemy, the Dummy.  At the end of this series, our hero rode off with Stuff's son (who had been trained by [[Richard Dragon]]).

Vigilante continued to appear in the DCU until recently, having been established as running a [[dude ranch]] in Mesa City (the former home of Western hero [[Johnny Thunder]]). 
{{spoiler}}
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers]]'' # 0, the Vigilante establishes a new Seven Soldiers of Victory to battle the monstrous spider of Miracle Mesa. He is apparently killed alongside the rest of the team, only to mysteriously re-appear later in ''Bulleteer'' # 3.

Note: Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], there were both an [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-1 and an Earth-2]] Vigilante.  Both were Greg Saunders from their respective Earths.  Earth-1's Vigilante was revealed to exist in the pages (and cover) of the JLA issue where the superteam moved to their classic headquarters on an orbiting satellite.

==Other Vigilantes==
===Adrian Chase===
[[image:Vigilante17alanmoore.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Cover of ''Vigilante'' #17.]]
The character was revived and updated in [[1983]]'s ''[[Titans (comics)|New Teen Titans]] Annual'' #2 by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Perez]].

His identity this time was '''Adrian Chase''', a [[New York]] [[district attorney]] whose family was killed by mobsters. This caused Chase to seek justice in his own way as the Vigilante. The character was one of the first amoral comic characters and influenced by the [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]] from [[Marvel Comics]] and [[The Executioner]] series of novels.

After his initial appearance he gained his own ongoing series initially written by [[Marv Wolfman]] but later included writers such as [[Alan Moore]] and [[Paul Kupperberg]]. In the early issues of Vigilante, it was shown that Adrian took pains to make sure he didn't kill his enemies (unlike the Punisher) - he would regularly use non-lethal weaponry to disable his opponents. However, in issue 37, Vigilante allowed a police officer to die as a direct result of his actions. Vigilante then became more violent and cared less about who was caught in the crossfire.

Throughout the series Chase  was tormented over the justice of his actions and the pain it had brought to others. As early as the second issue of the series Chase flirted with abandoning his costumed identity after he savagely beat an ex-convict who turned out to be innocent. Eventually Chase abandoned his identity as Vigilante, believing that he could be both more effective and also more happy as a judge. However, during his absence the identity of Vigilante was assumed, in succession, by two of his friends without his knowledge.

The first of these was fellow judge Alan Welles, who operated in a much more violent manner, even executing petty thieves. Chase eventually tracked down and killed this incarnation of Vigilante, without realizing it was his friend. The incident led to increased guilt on Chase's part and also increased scrutiny from a law enforcement task force headed by [[Harry Stein]], as he attempted to cover up Alan Welles' role as Vigilante.  

Shortly after this Dave Winston, Adrian Chase's bailiff assumed the Vigilante identity.  Refusing to kill, Winston traded on the fierce reputation of Vigilante to intimidate information out of thugs. He was murdered by [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] while attempting to stop the hijacking of a plane which Chase was on. In the wake of Winston's death, Chase once again assumed the role of Vigilante, feeling that it was the only way to protect those he loved. Seeking revenge on Peacemaker, the out of shape Chase was beaten in a fight and unmasked on live TV, thereby ending his secret identity and forcing him even further into the role of Vigilante.  

As the series progressed Chase became ever more conflicted over his role as Vigilante, the violence he engaged in, and the harm he caused to those around him. He also became increasingly mentally unstable -- alternating between bouts of enraged violence, paranoia, and terrible remorse for his actions. His mounting guilt culminated in the final issue of his series (#50) where, after contemplating the course of his life, Chase committed suicide.

Before his death, he frequently battled [[Cannon and Saber]] and [[Electrocutioner]].

===Pat Trayce===
The next Vigilante was '''Patricia Trayce''', a rogue cop who teams up with Deathstroke the Terminator in the ''[[Deathstroke the Terminator]]'' series written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George Perez]].  Trayce found the gear of the second Vigilante (Adrian Chase) and adapted the guise.  She was also Deathstroke's lover. She first appeared in ''Deathstroke the Terminator'' #6. In ''Deathstroke the Terminator #11'', with covers by [[Mike Zeck]] at the time, Pat Trayce takes up the uniform of the Vigilante. She was trained by Deathstroke, and soon started to worked alone

===Vigilante IV===
Late in [[2005]], DC began to publish a Vigilante limited series written by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]].  The identity of the title character is initially left mysterious, but apparently this is a new incarnation of the character.

This Vigilante was last seen, alongside [[Wild Dog (comics)|Wild Dog]] and the current [[Crimson Avenger]], on a rooftop in the great [[battle of Metropolis]], raining bullets down on the [[Trigger Twins]], the Madmen and Spellbinder II and others in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7.

==Other versions==
In [[Kingdom Come (comic book series)|Kingdom Come]], [[Alex Ross ]] portrays the cowboy version of the Vigilante fighting alongside the rogue metahumans as a  [[steampunk]]  [[ cyborg]] with a [[pinwheel]]/[[steam engine]] arm with a [[gatling gun]] on the end.

==Other media==
In the 1940's there was a thirteen-chapter movie serial based on the vigilante called ''[[The Vigilante Fighting Hero of the West]]''.

The original Vigilante appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in the traditional style cowboy hat and costume, usually alongside [[Shining Knight]]. He mentioned that he was imprisoned by the [[Thanagar]]ians during the invasion during the episode "Hunter's Moon" and also appears in episodes like "Dark Heart" and "Task Force X". Vigilante was voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]] in the episodes "Hunter's Moon" and "Patriot Act". He rides a motorcycle and appears to use a pair of revolvers with special bullets that don't need to be reloaded.
