'''Azrael''' ('''Jean-Paul Valley''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe|DC Comics universe]]. He first appeared in the 1992–1993 four-issue [[limited series]] ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'', created by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Joe Quesada]], and later as a supporting character in various [[Batman Family]] titles, before gaining his own self-titled series (also by O'Neil). The character also adopted the alias '''[[Batman (set index)|Batman]]''' during the ''[[Knightfall]]'' storyline.

He is named after the traditional [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] and shares the name Azrael with a [[Teen Titans]] character introduced years earlier, making him the second Azrael in the DC Universe.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Azrael | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 33  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in the series ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'', released in 1992.

He then became a supporting character in the monthly Batman titles, eventually taking over the role of Batman through the Knightfall/Knightquest/KnightsEnd story arcs.

The subsequent ''Azrael'' series, chronicling Valley's battles against the Order of St. Dumas, ran for 100 issues between 1995 and 2003.  Starting with issue #47, it was retitled ''Azrael: Agent of the Bat'' in an attempt to boost sales by tying the series in with the rest of the Batman [[mythology|mythos]], including Azrael as part of the team of Batman, Robin, and the new [[Batgirl]] ([[Cassandra Cain]]).

Part of the [[Battle for the Cowl]] storyline involves an ''Azrael'' three-issue mini-series written by [[Fabian Nicieza]].<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/939/939673p1.html Batman: Battle for the Cowl - Enter Azrael], [[IGN]], December 18, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19314 Fabian Nicieza Unleashes Azrael], [[Comic Book Resources]], December 29, 2008</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===''The Sword of Azrael''===
Jean-Paul Valley, a university graduate student of [[computer science]] in [[Gotham City]], is unaware that he is the latest in a line of [[assassin]]-[[enforcer]]s for "[[The Sacred Order of Saint Dumas]]", a sinister religious [[secret society]], and had received training and mental conditioning to prepare him for his role since before he was born. For most of his life, he has been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] with "The System", a deep level of [[Operant conditioning|psychological conditioning]]. 

Valley only learns of this upon the death of his father, who was also his predecessor, at which time his conditioning is activated and he is called upon to take up the mantle of Azrael. When he is sent by the Order to kill a weapons dealer, a rogue member of the Order who had turned against the others and killed his father, he crosses paths with Batman, also investigating the death of Valley's father. He works with [[Alfred Pennyworth]] to find the weapons dealer after he has captured Bruce Wayne, using the Batman costume to kill the other Order members. He is shown the error of his ways and decides to fight alongside Batman against the criminals of Gotham, rejecting his "birthright" and seeking Batman's help in breaking his conditioning to forge his own [[destiny]]. 

His name is not revealed until the end of the story, at which point he claims it was his father's name too. However a later storyline in his solo series stated his father's name to be Ludovic Valley.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Batman comics===
Valley is given a job as a security guard at WayneTech headquarters, and also becomes an [[apprentice]] crimefighter alongisde Batman and Robin, learning basic detective work.

===''Knightfall''===

{{Main|Batman: Knightfall}}
Valley plays a pivotal role in the "Knightfall" [[story arc]] (1992–1994), in which he stands in as Batman after Bruce Wayne is defeated and [[paralysis|paralyzed]] at the hands of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]].  Against Bruce Wayne's orders, Valley fights and defeats Bane, wearing an enhanced battle-armour he designed and built under the influence of the System. His performance as Batman is influenced by his Azrael conditioning; he grows increasingly violent, allowing the mass murderer [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]] to fall to his death, thereby also allowing one of Abattoir's still-living victims to die. Valley also had control problems with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] as his partner and vice-versa, which reached its peak when he almost strangles him to death and bans him from the [[Batcave]]. He holes off the Batcave from Wayne Manor and the Drake property, and eschews working with Commissioner Gordon and the Gotham police.

Initially, Wayne is impressed enough to let him remain as Batman, but when Robin tells him of Abattoir's death, he resolves to reclaim the Batman mantle. With his back repaired, Wayne goes after Valley to reclaim his identity. After a prolonged battle in the Batcave, Valley is forced to remove his armour, subsequently departing Wayne Manor after acknowledging Bruce Wayne as the true Batman.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Valley lives among the homeless population of Gotham for several weeks, befriending an [[alcoholic]] former [[psychiatrist]] named Brian.

===Monthly Series===

[[Image:Blacklanternazrael.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Azrael as a [[Black Lantern]] from ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #4]]

Bruce Wayne seeks out Valley in order to grant him money and resources to explore his origins. Along with Brian, he discovers the evil conspiracies within the order of St. Dumas, and they help a nun named Sister Lilhy escape. With the help of [[Ra's al Ghul]] he discovers that he is a genetically engineered [[in vitro fertilisation|test tube baby]], and his [[gene]]s have been [[genetic engineering|spliced]] with those of animals.

He returns to Gotham for several crossover events, including [[Underworld Unleashed]], [[Batman: Contagion|Contagion]], [[Batman: Legacy|Legacy]], and [[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]. He also discovers that his father's killer, Carlton LeHah, is still alive.

He also changes his costume considerably for a time. Azrael returns to his original costume and battles supposed [[hallucination]]s that are supposed to represent both his father and St. Dumas himself. Toward the end of the series, Azrael is plagued by apparently [[supernatural]] occurrences in the form of possible [[miracle]]s.  

Azrael is seemingly killed in the series' final issue, shot with two specially-coated bullets while battling archenemies Scratch and Carlton Lehah. However, his body is never recovered.<ref name="dc-ency"/> His death went unconfirmed for several years. In ''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #10, a note can be seen written on time traveler Rip Hunter's [[chalk board]] reading "Jean Paul Valley Lives!". In the following issue, another note says "Azrael comes and goes." However, Jean-Paul's death is confirmed when he appears in ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #4 (October 2009) as an [[zombie|undead]] member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|title=[[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|date=October 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

Jean-Paul Valley makes a cameo at Batman's funeral service in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 2009 story, ''[[Batman: Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?]]'', a story which is [[metaphysical]] in nature.

===Michael Lane===
{{Main|Azrael (comic book)}}

In 2009, a mini-series titled ''Azrael: Death's Dark Knight''<ref name="09Miniseries">[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120810-DiDio-20.html Newsarama.com : Dan DiDio: 20 Answers, 1 Question - Batman and More], [[Newsarama]]</ref> was produced as a tie-in to the [[Battle for the Cowl]] crossover event, with a later regular series.

The new Azrael is [[Batman & Son#Lane/"Bat-Devil"|the Third "Ghost of Batman"]] to undergo Doctor Hurt's experiments; an [[African American]] ex-cop named '''Michael Washington Lane'''. He is approached by the Order of Purity to reclaim the mantle of Azrael after the Order of Dumas' latest Azrael went mad and killed an undercover police officer. On his first night as Azrael he fights [[Talia Al Ghul]] and a new team of mercenaries led by [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]] and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}} After convincing Nightwing that he was not responsible for the murdered police officer, Nightwing persuades Talia to allow Michael to keep the Suit of Sorrows. In ''Batman And The Outsiders'' (vol. 2) #14, the character is displayed as a charming, smooth black man who undergoes various purification rituals, overseen by the Order of Purity.<ref name="Batman And The Outsiders #14">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Frank Tieri|Tieri, Frank]] | penciller = [[Ryan Benjamin|Benjamin, Ryan]] | inker = [[Saleem Crawford|Crawford, Saleem]] | story = A Family Affair | title = Batman and the Outsiders | volume = 2 | issue = 14 | date = February 2009 | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id =}}</ref> The character is currently active in Gotham City.

==Other versions==
*Valley is not the only Azrael in the DC Universe. Valley's father was the previous Azrael. A Chinese man, supposedly given the same training as Valley, and an identical costume, is briefly under the control of the Order. Also, the position of the order's enforcer has been passed on since medieval times.

*Earlier on in the ''Azrael'' series, another man is supposedly selected and trained in the same way as Valley and the Chinese Azrael to be Valley's replacement. He is defeated by Valley and supposedly falls to his death, only to resurface in Gotham at one point wearing one of Valley's 'Batman' armors and engaging in underground fights.

==Powers and abilities==
The source of Azrael's abilities is a post-hypnotic training regimen known as The System. The details of The System are never fully explained, but it is understood that training begins before birth and includes genetic modification, prenatal electric shock, and the use of apes as surrogate mothers. The end result is a human being who is inhumanly strong and fast and has a raging split personality triggered by the donning of the Azrael costume. The split personality is apparently coached to believe it is an actual [[Bible|Biblical]] [[angel]] of vengeance. His weapons include wrist-mounted swords which ignite flames and can also be launched from the gauntlets. Azrael also dons a bullet- and flame-proof armor.

It is implied towards the middle of the series that all Azraels have been imparted with some form of The System, but that the training and genetic tampering have been updated and changed significantly in the Order's 500 year history. The System also somehow separates an Azrael's civilian identity from his powers, in that they are only super strong or super fast while in costume. However, towards the end of his life Jean-Paul was able to manifest these abilities while in his normal personality.

Azrael is also an expert with computers. When he was first introduced in ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'' #1, it was revealed that Jean-Paul was studying computer programming in college and during Knightquest he frequently dealt with Tim Drake's (then newly appointed as Robin) attempts to hack the Batcave's computer system successfully, once stating that Tim was overconfident in his abilities and that a far more experienced hacker now inhabited the cave.

Jean Paul also trained as a detective when he was with Batman's team.  

===Equipment===
Azrael's original costume consists of special red and gold armor. After becoming an "Agent of the Bat", he dons silver and black armor with a red cape and a stylized red bat symbol on the chest. Later on, he dons red armor with golden gauntlets, boots, shoulder pads and a blue cape. He sometimes carries a flaming sword, and also uses two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume. On page 71 of the updated edition of ''Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight'', Scott Beatty implied that Azrael's changing costumes were reflections of the changes in Azrael's life from an agent of St. Dumas to an agent of the Batman to his own man.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==In other media==
===Video games===
Azrael is a character that can be officially created after obtaining all the mini-kits for the hero chapters of the game in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' in the character customization feature. The [[Nintendo DS]] version also features him and can be unlocked and made available to purchase after all the levels have been completed and True Hero on Batboat Chase.

Azrael is set to appear in the upcoming [[MMORPG]] ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
