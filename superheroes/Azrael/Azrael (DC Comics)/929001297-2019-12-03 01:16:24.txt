'''Azrael''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe|DC Comics universe]]. Azrael is a member of a group of assassins who were created by [[The Sacred Order of Saint Dumas]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in the 1992 four-issue miniseries ''Batman: Sword of Azrael''<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 255 |quote = Azrael, one of the most important characters of the modern Batman mythos, was dropped right under the noses of an unsuspecting reading populace in the debut issue of ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'' by esteemed bat-scribe Denny O'Neil, talented young penciler Joe Quesada, and inker extraordinaire Kevin Nowlan. }}</ref> as Jean-Paul Valley.

He then became a supporting character in the monthly [[Batman]] titles, eventually taking over the role of Batman<ref>Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 260: "By ''Batman'' #500, the last chapter of the 'Knightfall' saga by writer Doug Moench and artist Jim Aparo and Mike Manley, Azrael was truly his own [version of] Batman."</ref> through the "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]", "Knightquest", and "KnightsEnd" story arcs. One of the creators, [[Denny O'Neil]], admitted to having difficulties with Azrael's transition from villain to hero: "If I'd known he was to become a monthly character, I might have set him up differently ... The problem is that I had to turn a bad guy into a real hero, not just an anti-hero or lead. It's possible to do that, but it's difficult to retain the original characterization. You almost have to change his personality."<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Villain Turned Hero: Azrael | magazine = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 39}}</ref>

The subsequent ''[[Azrael (comic book)|Azrael]]'' series, chronicling Valley's battles against the Order of St. Dumas, ran for 100 issues between 1995 and 2003. Starting with issue #47,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mikesamazingworld.com/mikes/features/series.php?seriesid=142 |title=Azrael |last=Voiles |first=Mike |website=Mike's Amazing World of Comics |access-date=February 4, 2018}}</ref> it was retitled to ''Azrael: Agent of the Bat'' in an attempt to boost sales by tying the series in with the rest of the Batman [[mythology|mythos]], including Azrael as part of the team of Batman, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and the new [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]].

Michael Lane was introduced as a character called ''Azrael'' as part of the [[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]], a storyline told in a three-issue miniseries format written by [[Fabian Nicieza]].<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/939/939673p1.html "Batman: Battle for the Cowl - Enter Azrael"], ''[[IGN]]'', December 18, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19314 "Fabian Nicieza Unleashes Azrael"], ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'', December 29, 2008</ref> This iteration of the character as a member of the Order of Purity has not been brought into the Rebirth era of DC.

==Fictional character biography==

===Jean-Paul Valley===
Jean-Paul Valley, a university graduate student of [[computer science]] in [[Gotham City]], is unaware that he is the latest in a line of [[assassination|assassin]]-[[Criminal|enforcers]] for "[[The Sacred Order of Saint Dumas]]", a sinister religious [[secret society]]. For most of his life, he has been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] with ''The System'', a deep level of [[Operant conditioning|psychological conditioning]].

Valley only learned of his new status upon the death of his father, who was also his predecessor, at which time his conditioning was activated and he was called upon to take up the mantle of Azrael.<ref>''Batman: Sword of Azrael'' #1</ref> When he was sent by the Order to kill weapons dealer Carlton LeHah, a rogue member of the Order who turned against the others and killed Valley's father, he crossed paths with Batman, who had been investigating the death. He worked with [[Alfred Pennyworth]] to find LeHah after he had captured Bruce Wayne, using the Batman costume to kill the other Order members. Valley worked with Alfred, demonstrating a detective's intuition in tracking LeHah's movements and later risking himself to rescue Bruce despite his traditional mission of vengeance. In doing so, he was shown the error of his ways and decided to fight alongside Batman against the criminals of Gotham, rejecting his "birthright" and seeking Batman's help in breaking his conditioning to forge his own destiny.

His name is not revealed to Alfred and Bruce until the end of the story, at which point he claims it also was his father's name (a later storyline in his solo series stated his father's name to be Ludovic Valley, however).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Azrael | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 33 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

Valley is given a job as a security guard at [[WayneTech]] headquarters, and also becomes an [[apprentice]] crimefighter alongside Batman and Robin, learning basic detective work.

[[File:AzBat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|{{Descript-cvr-art|Batman: Shadow of the Bat|1|#25|March, 1994|art=[[Brian Stelfreeze]]|pub=DC|¶ = y}}]]
Valley plays a pivotal role in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' [[story arc]] (1993–1994), in which he stands in as Batman after Bruce Wayne is defeated and [[paralysis|paralyzed]] at the hands of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. He decides that Bruce's tactics as Batman are obsolete and believes that he must fight criminals on their terms which makes him far more brutal and merciless, often even showing little regard for innocent bystanders. Against Bruce Wayne's orders, Valley fights and defeats Bane, wearing enhanced battle-armor he designed and built under the influence of the System after he was narrowly defeated by Bane in their first confrontation.<ref>''Batman'' #500</ref> His performance as Batman is influenced by his Azrael conditioning. He grows increasingly violent and delusional, allowing the mass murderer [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]] to fall to his death, thereby also allowing one of Abattoir's still-living hostages to die.<ref>''Batman'' #508</ref> Valley also has control problems with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]'s partnership, emphasized when Valley almost strangles him to death and bans him from the [[Batcave]]. He seals off the Batcave from [[Wayne Manor]] and the Drake property, and eschews working with [[Commissioner Gordon]] and the Gotham police. Valley also suffers from continuous hallucinations of both his father and St. Dumas who tell him that he is the real Batman and that he must avenge his father's death (having convinced himself that Lehah was just the man who instigated his father's death while one of the man's former henchmen actually pulled the trigger).

Initially, Wayne is impressed enough with Valley's results to let him remain as Batman, but when Drake tells Wayne of Abattoir's death, he resolves to reclaim the Batman mantle. With his back repaired thanks to the sacrifice of psychic healer Doctor [[Shondra Kinsolving]], and his fighting instincts rehabilitated after lessons with [[Lady Shiva]], Wayne goes after Valley to reclaim his identity. After a prolonged battle that stretches from a Gotham penthouse to a major bridge before culminating in a final showdown in the Batcave, Bruce tricks Valley into removing his armor, excluding his helmet (with night-vision lenses engaged), and exposes him to bright sunlight - the shock snaps Valley out of his delusional state. Acknowledging Bruce Wayne as the true Batman, Valley apologizes and asks for his forgiveness, which Bruce accepts, recognizing his own role in Valley's descent into madness during his time as Batman, but tells Valley to leave Wayne Manor immediately.<ref name="dc-ency" />

Valley lives among the [[homelessness|homeless]] population of Gotham for several weeks, befriending an [[alcoholic]] former [[psychiatrist]] named Brian Bryan.

Valley is then sought out by Bruce Wayne, who feels responsible for his mental breakdown after attaining and losing the mantle of Batman. Bruce grants him a small fortune in money, information on the Order of St. Dumas' whereabouts, and resources to explore his origins. Along with Bryan, he discovers the evil conspiracies within the order of St. Dumas, and they help a nun named Sister Lilhy escape. With the help of [[Ra's al Ghul]], Valley discovers that he is a genetically engineered [[in vitro fertilisation|test tube baby]], and his [[gene]]s have been [[genetic engineering|spliced]] with those of animals.

He returns to Gotham for several crossover events, including ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', ''[[Batman: Contagion|Contagion]]'', ''[[Batman: Legacy|Legacy]]'', and ''[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]''. He also discovers that his father's killer, Carlton LeHah, is still alive. Valley attempts to regain Batman's trust after the events of the ''KnightsEnd'' arc. Batman, who feels responsible for Valley, especially after realizing that he gave him very little training and support, decides to give Azrael missions to carry out as a test to prove himself. The first of these missions is to defeat a resurfaced Bane, but it is not until Azrael saves the lives of a group of [[U.S. Senator]]s (one of which tries to plead to [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the funds to rebuild Gotham City after its devastating earthquake) that Batman begins to fully trust him again. Prior to those events, Batman sent Azrael after Nicholas Scratch, who was planning to kill another Senator who also wanted federal money to save Gotham City. While pursuing Scratch, Azrael was framed for the Senator's murder after he was strangled to death moments before Azrael arrived to save him.

After being framed, Azrael is given a new costume designed by Batman and uses it for a time, especially during the ''No Man's Land'' story arc. Azrael helps Batman maintain a chaotic Gotham City, often with the assistance of the new Batgirl, and protects [[Leslie Thompkins]]' medical clinic inside of No Man's Land. After foiling Scratch's plan of framing him for murder, Azrael returns to his original costume and battles [[hallucination]]s that represent both his father and St. Dumas himself. Toward the end of the series, Azrael is plagued by [[supernatural]] occurrences in the form of possible [[miracle]]s.

Azrael is seemingly killed in the series' final issue, shot with two specially-coated bullets while battling Scratch and LeHah. Scratch is arrested, and LeHah falls into the river with Azrael. However, Azrael's body is never recovered,<ref name="dc-ency" /> and his death went unconfirmed for several years. In ''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #10, a note can be seen written on time traveler Rip Hunter's [[chalk board]] reading "Jean-Paul Valley Lives!" In the following issue, another note says, "Azrael comes and goes." Azrael appears in ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #4 as an [[zombie|undead]] member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]; although at first it had not been confirmed whether it was Jean-Paul Valley or another Azrael (such as Ludovic Valley, who died in Gotham City). The index section of the ''Blackest Night'' tabloid later indicated that it was in fact Jean-Paul.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|title=[[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|date=October 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>

Jean-Paul Valley makes a cameo at Batman's funeral service in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 2009 story ''[[Batman: Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?]]'' He is seen stepping up to deliver his own version of Batman's death as a background event, however his story is unseen and he has no lines. The story is [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] in nature, not affecting the overall status of the canon or Azrael's fate.

====The New 52====
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Jean-Paul Valley reappeared as Azrael in an arc of ''Batman & Robin: Eternal''. His design was updated, with his main weapon being his sword rather than gauntlets (although he was later shown to still possess the gauntlet blades). His character, however, was essentially the same, working as an enforcer for the Order of St. Dumas. In the comic, he defeated Bane and eventually turned on his handler and the Order to assist [[Red Hood (Jason Todd)|Red Hood]] and [[Tim Drake]]. This marked the first proper appearance of a living Jean-Paul Valley in the DCU in over a dozen years, with previous appearances relegated to either minimal cameos or the aforementioned Black Lantern revival of the character.<ref>''Batman and Robin: Eternal'' #9</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
{{Update|date=August 2017}}
In 2016, Jean Paul made his post Rebirth debut in the first issue of the ''Detective Comics'' line, starting with issue #934. Jean Paul made a few cameo appearances in the first two issues before joining the roster fully in issue #943.

After something was done to his suit by Ascalon, Luke Fox gave him a new suit inspired by [[Batman]] and after the fight Azrael went back to his old suit.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #962</ref> After [[Batwoman]] invited Azrael and [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Batwing]] to join her colony, they agree in hopes to reshape the colony.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #976</ref>

Azrael has been confirmed to join the new [[Justice League]] team [[Justice League Odyssey]] in 2018.

===Michael Washington Lane===
In 2009, a miniseries titled ''Azrael: Death's Dark Knight''<ref name="09Miniseries">[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/120810-DiDio-20.html Newsarama.com : Dan DiDio: 20 Answers, 1 Question - Batman and More], [[Newsarama]]</ref> was produced as a tie-in to the ''[[Battle for the Cowl]]'' crossover event, with a later regular series.

The new Azrael is [[Batman and Son#Aftermath|the Third "Ghost of Batman"]] to undergo [[Doctor Hurt]]'s experiments, an ex-cop named '''Michael Washington Lane'''. He is approached by the Order of Purity to reclaim the mantle of Azrael after the Order's latest Azrael went mad and killed an undercover police officer. On his first night as Azrael, Lane fights [[Talia al Ghul]] (and her team of mercenaries led by [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]]) and later encounters [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]].<ref>''Azrael: Death's Dark Knight'' #1-3 (May 2009 - July 2009)</ref> After convincing Nightwing that he was not responsible for the murdered police officer, Nightwing persuades Talia to allow Michael to keep the Suit of Sorrows. In ''Batman and the Outsiders'' (vol. 2) #14, the character is displayed as a charming man who undergoes various purification rituals overseen by the Order of Purity.<ref name="Batman And The Outsiders #14">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Tieri, Frank]] | penciller = [[Ryan Benjamin (comics)|Benjamin, Ryan]] | inker = [[Saleem Crawford|Crawford, Saleem]] | story = A Family Affair | title = Batman and the Outsiders | volume = 2 | issue = 14 | date = February 2009 | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

Ra's al Ghul later attempts to manipulate Lane into destroying Gotham by having him commit suicide and be subsequently resurrected by the Suit, which had been dipped in a Lazarus Pit. Lane worked with metahuman Crusader to 'judge' [[Dick Grayson|Batman]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] for their past 'sins' to determine if Gotham should be saved. These included the insane obsession of Selina's sister that Selina is 'possessed', Robin not showing due reverence when he destroyed a church window to save hostages, and a childhood incident where Dick let another circus performer get assaulted because he was jealous. Although Lane is manipulated into perceiving the Bat-Family as having failed his tests, Batman convinces Lane to use his swords to test himself, revealing Ra's' plan in time for Lane to stop the planned destruction of new metahuman [[Fireball (comics)|Fireball]]. Ra's intended for Azrael to detonate Fireball and make it appear as though Gotham had been destroyed by terrorists, inciting a wave of violence that would cleanse Earth and allow Ra's to take control.

Michael Lane has also appeared in ''[[The New 52]]''. Michael Lane was originally featured in ''[[Batwoman]]'' issue #2 as a cameo, which was written before the relaunch but published after, however the art was edited in order to remove him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rich|title=Batwoman #2 Deletes Azrael And Lady Blackhawk From The DC Universe|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/10/07/batwoman-2-deletes-azrael-and-lady-blackhawk-from-the-dc-universe/|publisher=Bleeding Cool}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Azrael, Jean-Paul has enhanced physical abilities. He has been shown to fight at heightened levels even when fatigued, a fact exemplified when Azrael was able to defeat Bane, despite suffering from both extreme exhaustion and Venom withdrawal.<ref>''Azrael'' #39</ref> He has also been shown to be able to resist an even more potent version of the Venom drug, having been able to break its vast addiction in only one night. Azrael is also a superior fighter; although he lacks technique and style in his fighting moves, he makes up for it with his inhuman speed, reflexes, and agility. Azrael has been able to match [[Deathstroke]] in a sword duel and has even defeated Batman in hand-to-hand combat.<ref>''Azrael'' #99</ref> This is not only due to his martial arts skills, but also due to his inhuman physical abilities.

===Equipment===
The original Azrael costume worn by Jean-Paul Valley consists of red and gold armor. After becoming an "Agent of the Bat", he dons silver and black armor with a red cape and a stylized red bat symbol on the chest. Later on, he dons red armor with golden gauntlets, boots, shoulder pads and a blue cape. He sometimes carries a flaming sword, and also uses two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume that can be charged with thermal energy to increase their destructive power. In ''Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight'', Scott Beatty implied that Azrael's changing costumes were reflections of the changes in Azrael's life from an agent of St. Dumas to an agent of the Batman to his own man.<ref name="dc-ency" /> The gauntlets were taken by Kate Spencer, the current [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter]], and are used in her outfit. The ''New 52'' version of Jean-Paul wears a similar costume, and his weapon is a flaming knight sword called Murasame. He also possesses the familiar gauntlet blades as well.

==Other versions==
Valley and Lane are not the only bearers of the name Azrael in the DC Universe:

* Valley's father (Jean-Paul/'''Ludovic Valley''') was the previous Azrael, as seen in ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'' (referenced by his son as having the same name) and, with more detail, in ''Azrael Annual #1'' (identified as just Ludovic Valley).
* A Chinese man, supposedly given the same training as Valley and an identical costume, is briefly under the control of the Order. Also, the position of the Order of St. Dumas' enforcer has been passed on since medieval times.
* Earlier on in the ''Azrael'' series, another man is supposedly selected and trained in the same way as Valley and the Chinese man to be Valley's replacement. He is defeated by Valley and supposedly falls to his death, only to resurface in Gotham early in the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event wearing one of Valley's 'Batman' armors and engaging in underground fights after having made a deal with [[Abra Kadabra]] (acting on behalf of [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]) for his soul in return for his life.
* In ''[[The Multiversity]]: The Just'', which takes place on the alternate Earth-16 (where the grown sidekicks and children of superheroes live on an Earth free of crime), [[Damian Wayne]], the new Batman, has a variation of Jean Paul's Azrael suit in a glass display in the Batcave.
* Jean-Paul Valley appears [[Sean Murphy (artist)|Sean Murphy]]'s ''Batman: Curse of the White Knight'' as a former [[United States Army]] veteran who has being diagnosed with terminal cancer, whom the Joker who claims that God has a mission for him.
* The one-shot "'''Dark Multiverse: Knightfall'''" depicts a world where Jean Paul as Batman defeates Bruce Wayne, kills Gotham's villains, and keeps Bruce Wayne alive as a head and torso in Wayne Tower linked to a life support system, constantly visiting him to receive his approval of Valley's methods. Bane's son and Lady Shiva rescue Wayne, providing him with a new nanotech body. Wayne kills his former successor, revealing that his years of isolation and torment have driven him to a point where he concludes that he can only rely on himself, then kills Shiva and strings Azrael up on a bat-sigil in the style of a crucifixion.

===Power Rangers/Justice League===
When [[Lord Zedd]] and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] form an alliance to steal the Power Rangers' Power Coins and attack their world, the League permit the Rangers to access their archives to provide them with equipment and resources to battle their enemies' forces until they can regain their powers. [[Jason Lee Scott]] uses Azrael's sword- Batman noting that the sword will only ignite into flame if wielded by one with a strong spirit- although he also uses the helmet of the [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]] for additional protection and to preserve his identity.<ref>''Power Rangers/Justice League'' #4</ref>

==In other media==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

===Television===
Azrael made his live-action debut in the [[Gotham (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by [[James Frain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/get-ready-for-azraels-gotham-debut-with-new-synopsis |title=Get Ready for Azrael's 'Gotham' Debut with New Synopsis |website=Comic Book Resources |date=2016-04-08 |accessdate=2016-04-08}}</ref> This version of the character is '''Theo Galavan''', a billionaire industrialist who is secretly the heir apparent of the Order of Saint Dumas, and uncle of [[Silver St. Cloud]]. Galavan is the power behind a group of insane criminals called "The Maniax" who terrorize Gotham, but betrays them by killing their leader, [[Joker in other media|Jerome Valeska]], making him a public hero. He is elected Mayor of Gotham with the reluctant help of [[Penguin (comics)|Oswald Cobblepot]], whom he blackmails into killing the other mayoral candidates by holding his mother, Gertrude, hostage. When Galavan's assassin sister, [[Tigress (comics)|Tabitha]] kills Gertrude anyway, Cobblepot swears revenge and enters a tenuous alliance with [[James Gordon (comics)|Detective Jim Gordon]] to bring Galavan down. The two of them eventually expose Galavan's corruption, destroy his criminal empire, and kill him. In "[[Wrath of the Villains: Pinewood]]", Galavan under the alias of "Patient 44" is revived by [[Hugo Strange]], who gives him enhanced physical abilities. Strange's experiments warp Galavan's mind, however; he has no memory of his past life, and believes himself to be Azrael, an ancient immortal warrior who vanquished the Order's enemies. Strange takes advantage of Galavan's delusions by ordering "Azrael" to kill Gordon, gifting him a sword, mask and medieval armor. Galavan attacks the Gotham City Police Department, killing several police officers and wounding its captain, Nathaniel Barnes. In "[[Wrath of the Villains: Unleashed]]", Galavan is poised to finally kill Gordon, Alfred and Bruce Wayne at [[Wayne Manor]], when Cobblepot and his henchman Butch Gilzean blow him up with a [[rocket-propelled grenade launcher]].<ref>[http://comicbook.com/2016/02/11/gotham-ep-promises-comics-accurate-azrael-in-second-half-of-seas/ Gotham EP Promises Comics-Accurate Azrael in Second Half of Season 2]</ref>

===Miscellaneous===
Azrael appears in issue #50 of ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' as a potential new member.

===Video games===
* Azrael is a character that can be officially created after obtaining all the mini-kits for the hero chapters in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]''. The [[Nintendo DS]] version also features him and can be unlocked and made available to purchase after all the levels have been completed and True Hero has been achieved on all of them.
* Azrael appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]''.
* Jean-Paul Valley, Michael Lane, and Azrael Batman are all playable characters in ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]''.

====''Batman: Arkham'' series====
The Michael Lane incarnation of Azrael appears in the ''[[Batman Arkham]]'' series, where he is voiced by [[Khary Payton]]:
* Azrael first appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' as part of the "Watcher in the Wings" side mission. After events in the game's story, he can be seen on the rooftops of certain buildings within Arkham City's districts, watching over Batman. When approached, Azrael will disappear in a cloud of smoke, leaving a symbol for Batman to scan. After scanning all the symbols and combining them to reveal a location, Batman meets Azrael, who tells him about the Order of St. Dumas and warns him of their prophecy of future events and the Dark Knight's end. Though Batman doubts this, Azrael tells him that, regardless of his belief, there are parts of it that are becoming true and they will meet again, disappearing into a cloud of smoke.
* The [[PlayStation 3]] edition of ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' features the ''Knightfall'' DLC pack containing an alternate Batman outfit based on Jean-Paul Valley's Batsuit as well as challenge maps based on ''Batman: Knightfall''.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sinan |last=Kubba |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/11/batman-arkham-origins-ps3-knightfall-content-detailed/ |title=Batman: Arkham Origins PS3 'Knightfall' content detailed |publisher=AOL |work=Joystiq |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613051946/http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/11/batman-arkham-origins-ps3-knightfall-content-detailed/ |archivedate=June 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* Azrael returns with a bigger role in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', where his outfit is primarily white with red patches. He is the protagonist of the "Heir to the Cowl" side quest. During [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s takeover of Gotham, the Order of St. Dumas sends Azrael to Gotham on a mission to become Batman's successor. Azrael meets up with Batman once again, who puts him through several trials to test his abilities and see if he is a worthy successor, during which Batman takes away his sword and Azrael is monitored by [[Alfred Pennyworth]], who then informs Batman that the vigilante uses the same fighting style as him, implying that Azrael has been watching Batman for years. After the final trial is completed, Azrael states that he is prepared to become Gotham's next protector, but Batman opts to wait until he says so, causing Azrael to depart. Afterwards, Alfred informs Batman of Azrael's secret identity as Michael Lane and that he has a microchip in his brain planted by that the Order of St. Dumas. Arriving at the hideout inside the old clock tower, Batman analyses the microchip and discovers that the Order have been subtly controlling Azrael's actions, as well as a secret encrypted message that reveals the Order's real plan: have Azrael kill Batman and replace him as Gotham's one and only protector, believing that him refusing to kill criminals stands in the way of true justice. Azrael, having followed Batman here, then confronts the Dark Knight and prepares to kill him and complete his mission, but Batman tells him how the Order have been in control of his actions all along, and then allows Azrael to take back his sword and do as he wishes with it. This leaves Azrael with three possible options, decided by the player: 
** If Azrael attempts to kill Batman with the sword, he is quickly subdued by the Dark Knight and subsequently incarcerated at the GCPD Headquarters, where Lane vows to escape and kill Batman one day. During this time, Azrael will begin arguing with [[Deacon Blackfire]] over who is the true champion of God.
** If Azrael picks up the sword and resists his orders, he breaks the sword in front of Batman to symbolize that the Order no longer have control over him and then leaves to exact revenge on the Order for their actions. Before leaving, Batman tells him that he  made the right choice and Azrael makes no further appearances in the story.
** If Azrael leaves without picking up the sword, the outcome will be the same, with Azrael bidding farewell to Batman and promising to make the Order pay for their actions, the only difference being that his sword will remain on display in the clock tower for the rest of the game. 
Azrael was later added as a playable character for the game's challenge maps, although he uses the same fighting style and gadgets as Batman (as Alfred mentions during the game that Azrael has been watching Batman for years and managed to mimic his every move).
