'''Azrael''' ('''Jean-Paul Valley''') is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe|DC Comics universe]]. He first appeared in the 1992–1993 four-issue [[limited series]] ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'', created by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Joe Quesada]], and later as a supporting character in various ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]''-related titles, before gaining his own self-titled series (also by O'Neil). He is named after the traditional [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] and shares the name Azrael with a [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] character introduced years earlier, making him the second Azrael in the DC Universe.

==Fictional character biography==
===''The Sword of Azrael''===
Jean-Paul Valley, a university student in [[Gotham City]], is unaware that he is the latest in a line of [[assassin]]-[[enforcer]]s for "[[The Sacred Order of Saint Dumas]]", a sinister [[secret society]], and had received training and mental conditioning to prepare him for his role since before he was born.  He is a [[in vitro fertilisation|test tube baby]], and his [[gene]]s have been [[genetic engineering|spliced]] with those of animals.  For most of his life, he has been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] with "The System", a deep level of [[Operant conditioning|psychological conditioning]].  Valley only learns of this upon the death of his father, who was also his predecessor, at which time his conditioning is activated and he is called upon to take up the mantle of Azrael. When he is sent by the Order to kill a weapons dealer, he crosses paths with Batman.  He is shown the error of his ways and he decides to fight with Batman against the criminals of Gotham, rejecting his "birthright" and seeking Batman's help in breaking his conditioning to forge his own [[destiny]]. His name isn't revealed until the end of the story, at which point he claims it was his father's name too.

===Knightfall===
{{main|Batman: Knightfall}}
Valley plays a pivotal role in the "[[Knightfall]]" [[story arc]] (1992–1994), in which he stands in as Batman after Bruce Wayne is defeated and [[paralysis|paralyzed]] at the hands of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]].  Against Bruce Wayne's orders, Valley fights and defeats Bane. His performance as Batman is influenced by his Azrael conditioning; he grows increasingly violent, allowing the criminal [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]] to fall to his death, thereby also allowing one of Abattoir's still-living victims to die. Valley also refuses to recognize [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] as his partner.

Although Valley disobeyed his orders, Wayne is impressed enough to let him remain as Batman but when Robin tells him of Abattoir's death, he resolves to reclaim the Batman mantle. He seeks training from his enemy, the deadly assassin [[Lady Shiva]]. As part of the training she unleashes one assassin after another on him until he is forced to break his vow never to kill. Wayne does actually appear to kill one of these assassins and Shiva, satisfied, calls off the attacks; the "killing" later turns out to be a bluff.

Wayne then goes after the technologically-enhanced Valley to reclaim his identity. After a prolonged battle on Gotham Bridge, when Azrael, using his own Batman suit, barely defeats [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], he is defeated when Wayne tricks him into removing his armor, forcing him to finally realize that Wayne is the true Batman. Valley, disgraced, leaves Gotham and becomes Azrael once more.

====Azrael====
As Azrael, Valley wears a red-and-gold costume.  He sometimes carries a flaming sword, and also uses two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume.  He unlocks his superhuman skills by tapping into "The System", which places a serious strain on his mind, and at times seems to be driving him [[insanity|insane]].

===Agent of the Bat===
The subsequent ''Azrael'' series, chronicling Valley's battles against the Order of St. Dumas, ran for 100 issues between 1995 and 2003.  Starting with issue #47, it was retitled ''Azrael: Agent of the Bat'' in an attempt to boost sales by tying the series in with the rest of the Batman [[mythology|mythos]], including Azrael as part of the team of Batman, Robin, and the new [[Batgirl]] ([[Cassandra Cain]]). He also changes his costume considerably for a time (see [[Azrael (comics)#Costumes|costumes]]). Azrael returns to his original costume and battles supposed [[hallucination]]s that are supposed to represent both his father and the creator of the order that spawned him, St. Dumas.

Toward the end of the series, Azrael is plagued by apparently [[supernatural]] occurrences, which sometimes seem to be [[miracle]]s.  

Azrael is seemingly killed in the series' final issue, shot with two specially-coated bullets while battling archenemies Scratch and Carlton Lehah. However, his body is never recovered.

==Powers and abilities==
The source of Azrael's abilities is a post-hypnotic training regimen known as The System.  The details of The System are never fully explained, but it is understood that training begins before birth and includes genetic modification, prenatal electric shock, and the use of gorillas as surrogate mothers. The end result is a human being who is inhumanly strong and fast and has a raging split personality triggered by the donning of the Azrael costume.  The split personality is apparently coached to believe it is an actual [[Bible|Biblical]] [[angel]] of vengeance.  His weapons include wrist-mounted swords which ignite flames and can also be launched from the gauntlets.  Azrael also dons a bullet- and flame-proof armor.

It is implied towards the middle of the series that all Azraels have been imparted with some form of The System, but that the training and genetic tampering have been updated and changed significantly in the Order's 500 year history.  The System also somehow separates an Azrael's civilian identity from his powers, in that they are only super strong or super fast while in costume. However, towards the end of his life Jean-Paul was able to manifest these abilities while in his normal personality.

Azrael is also an expert with computers.  When he was first introduced in ''Batman: Sword of Azrael #1'', it was revealed that Jean-Paul was studying computer programming in college.

==Costumes==
Azrael's original costume consists of special red and gold armor.  After becoming an "Agent of the Bat", he dons silver and black armor with a red cape and a stylized red bat symbol on the chest.  Later on, he dons red armor with golden gauntlets, boots, shoulder pads and a blue cape.  On page 71 of the updated edition of ''Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight'', Scott Beatty implied that Azrael's changing costumes were reflections of the changes in Azrael's life from an agent of St. Dumas to an agent of the Batman to his own man.  The Azrael entry in ''The DC Comics Encyclopedia'' confirms this.

==Previous Azraels==
Valley is not the only Azrael in the DC universe. A Chinese man, supposedly given the same training as Valley, and an identical costume, is briefly under the control of the Order.  Earlier on in the ''Azrael'' series, another man, is  supposedly selected and trained in the same way as Valley and the Chinese Azrael, to be Valley's replacement.  He is defeated by Valley, and supposedly falls to his death, only to resurface in Gotham at one point wearing one of Valley's 'Batman' armors and engaging in underground fights. Recently, Mark Shaw the former [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] was offered the mantle of Azrael.
