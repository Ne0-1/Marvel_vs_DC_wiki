'''Azrael''' ('''Jean-Paul Valley''') is a [[fictional character]] from [[DC Comics]]. He appeared originally in the 1992-1993 four-issue [[limited series]] ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'', created by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Joe Quesada]], and later as a supporting character in various ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]''-related titles, before gaining his own self-titled series (also by O'Neil). He shares the name [[Azrael]] with a [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] character introduced years earlier, making him the second Azrael in the [[DC Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
===''The Sword of Azrael''===
Jean-Paul Valley, a university student in [[Gotham City]], was unaware that he was the latest in a line of assassin-enforcers for "[[The Sacred Order of Saint Dumas]]", a sinister [[secret society]], and had received training and mental conditioning to prepare him for his role since before he was born. He was a [[test tube baby]], and his [[gene]]s had been [[genetic engineering|spliced]] with those of animals prior to birth.  Furthermore, for most of his pre-university life he had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] with "The System", a deep level of [[conditioning|psychological conditioning]].  Valley only learned of this upon the death of his father, who was also his predecessor, at which time his conditioning was activated and he was called upon to take up the mantle of Azrael (named for the [[Azrael|angel of death]]). When he was sent by the Order to kill a weapons dealer his path crossed with Batman, he was shown the error of his ways, and he decided to fight with Batman against the criminals of Gotham, rejecting his "birthright" and seeking Batman's help in breaking his conditioning to forge a new destiny of his own choice.

===Knightfall===
{{main|Knightfall}}
Valley played a pivotal role in the epic "Knightfall" [[story arc]] (1992 - 1994), in which he stood in as [[Batman]] after Bruce Wayne was defeated and [[paralysis|paralyzed]] at the hands of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. Against Bruce Wayne's orders, Valley fought and defeated Bane, but his performance as Batman was influenced by his Azrael conditioning; he grew increasingly violent, allowing the villain known as [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]] to fall to his death, thereby also allowing one of Abattoir's still-living victims to die.  Valley also refused to recognize [[Tim Drake|Robin]] as his partner.  Upon his return to fitness, Wayne was forced to fight the technologically-enhanced Valley to reclaim his identity. After a prolonged battle on Gotham Bridge, when Azrael nearly killed [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], he was defeated when Wayne tricked Valley into removing the bat-armour, forcing him to finally realise that Wayne was the true Batman. Valley, disgraced, left Gotham and became Azrael once more.

====Azrael====
As Azrael, Valley wore a costume in blood-red and gold coloring.  He sometimes carried a flaming sword, but also used two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume.  He unlocked his superhuman skills by tapping into "The System", which placed a serious strain on his mind, and at times seemed to be driving him [[insane]].

===Agent of the Bat===
The subsequent ''Azrael'' series, chronicling Valley's battles against the Order of St. Dumas, ran for 100 issues between 1995 and 2003. Starting with issue #47, it was retitled ''Azrael: Agent of the Bat'' in an attempt to boost sales by tying the series in with the rest of the Batman [[mythology|mythos]], including Azrael as part of the team of Batman, Robin, and the new [[Batgirl]] ([[Cassandra Cain]]), and also changed his costume considerably for a time, although this ploy ultimately failed.  Azrael returned to his original costume and battled supposed [[hallucination]]s that were supposed to represent both his father, and the creator of the order which spawned him, St. Dumas.

Toward the end of the series, Azrael was supposedly having supernatural occurrences somehow influencing his life, sometimes seeming to be miracles.  This however, was never legitimately explained.  He also seemed to be on the verge of physiological self-destruction and yet survived longer than it was presumed he should have been able to.  

Azrael was killed in the series' final issue, being riddled with bullets while battling archenemies Nicholas Scratch and Carlton Lehah.  However, his body was apparently never recovered. {{-}}

==Powers and abilities==
The source of Azrael's powers is a post-hypnotic training regimen known only as The System. The details of the system are unknown, but it is known that training begins before birth and includes genetic modification in addition to post-hypnotic suggestion. The end result is a human being who is superhumanly strong and fast and has a split personality triggered by the donning of the Azrael costume. The split personality is apparently coached to believe it is an actual biblical angel.

It is implied towards the middle of the series that all Azraels have been imparted with some form of The System, but that the training regimen and genetic modification has been updated and changed significantly in the Order's 500 year history. The System also somehow separates an Azrael's civilian identity from his powers, they are only super strong or super fast while in costume.

==Previous Azraels==
Valley was also not the only Azrael.  A Chinese man, supposedly given the same training as Valley, and an identical costume, was briefly under the control of a former member of the Order of St. Dumas.  Earlier on in the ''Azrael'' series, another man, presumably either American or European in ethnicity, was supposedly selected and trained in the same way as Valley and the Chinese Azrael, to be Valley's replacement.  He was defeated by Azrael, and supposedly fell to his death, only to resurface in Gotham at one point wearing one of Valley's 'Batman' armors and engaging in underground fights.  The exact whereabouts of this man are unknown.
