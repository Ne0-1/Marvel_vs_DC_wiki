'''Azrael''' ('''Jean-Paul Valley''') is a [[fictional character]] from [[DC Comics]].  He first appeared in the first issue of the [[miniseries]] ''Batman: Sword of Azrael'' ([[1992]], by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Joe Quesada]]), and appeared as a supporting character in various [[Batman]]-related titles, before gaining his own self-titled series (also by O'Neil).

Jean-Paul Valley, a university student in [[Gotham City]], was unaware that he was the latest in a line of assassin-enforcers for the Order of St. Dumas, a sinister [[secret society]], and had received training and mental conditioning to prepare him for his role since before he was born. He was a [[test tube baby]], and his [[gene]]s had been [[genetic engineering|spliced]] with those of animals prior to birth.  Furthermore, for most of his pre-university life he had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] with "The System", a deep level of [[conditioning|psychological conditioning]].  Valley only learned of this upon the death of his father, who was also his predecessor, at which time his conditioning was activated and he was called upon to take up the mantle of Azrael (named for the [[Azrael|angel of death]]).  He rejected this "birthright," and sought to overcome his conditioning and reclaim his life.

Valley played a pivotal role in the epic [[KnightSaga]] [[story arc]] ([[1993]] - [[1994]]), in which he stood in as Batman after Bruce Wayne was defeated and [[paralysis|paralyzed]] at the hands of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]].  Valley fought and defeated Bane, but his performance as Batman was influenced by his Azrael conditioning; he grew increasingly violent, allowing the villain known as [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]] to fall to his death, and refused to recognize [[Tim Drake|Robin]] as his partner.  Upon his return to fitness, Wayne was forced to fight the technologically-enhanced Valley to reclaim his identity.  Valley, disgraced, left Gotham and became Azrael once more.

During Jean Paul Valley's ([[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]) run as Batman, he started out wearing the original costume he was given by Wayne, which was the then current version of the suit (and is once again), and he decided to enhance it with clawed gauntlets of his own design, capable of firing Bat-shaped [[shuriken]].  However, he later created several updated versions of the suit which were essentially compact and highly flexible yet well designed and protective suits of armor and which went much better with the clawed gauntlets.  The first version of said armor, while a departure from the classic suit, is still the closest in appearance to the original costume.  It appeared in ''Batman'' not long after Jean Paul's first confrontation with Bane.  After he nearly died in conflict with Bane, Jean Paul designed the first armored version of the suit for the purposes of presenting greater offensive and defensive capabilities, as well as correcting certain flaws he percieved to exist in the suit.  It is unknown, but highly doubtful, that Wayne kept any of the improvements made to the suit, particularly the cape, which Valley redesigned to be able to use as either a parachute or glider.  Valley felt the excessive wind drag the cape produced was a hindrance (and to be fair, it was) and so redesigned it to be capable of using the wind for lift.  Wayne simply continued using the Batman costume he had been wearing up until Bane broke his back, and it is doubtful that he has incorporated or even studied any of the changes Valley had instituted on the grounds that he does not wish to make use of anything that directly references Valley's time as Batman.

As Azrael, Valley wore a costume in blood-red and gold coloring.  He sometimes carried a flaming sword, but also used two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume.  He unlocked his superhuman skills by tapping into "The System," which placed a serious strain on his mind, and at times seemed to be driving him [[insane]].  The subsequent ''Azrael'' series, chronicling Valley's battles against the Order of St. Dumas, ran for 100 issues between [[1995]] and [[2003]].  Towards the end of the series' run, it was retitled ''Azrael: Agent of the Bat'' in an attempt to boost sales by tying the series in with the rest of the Batman [[mythology|mythos]], including Azrael as part of the team of Batman, Robin, and the new Batgirl (Cassandra Cain), and also changed his costume considerably for a time, although this ploy ultimately failed.  Azrael returned to his original costume and battled supposed [[hallucination]]s that were supposed to represent both his father, and the creator of the order which spawned him, St. Dumas.

Towards the end of the series, Azrael was supposedly having supernatural occurances somehow influencing his life, sometimes seeming to be miracles.  This however, was never legitimately explained.  He also seemed to be on the verge of physiological self-destruction and yet survived longer than it was presumed he should have been able to.  Azrael was killed in the series' final issue.  However, his body was apparently never recovered, which could mean that at some point he may well return, as most characters in comic books are ''notorious'' for [[Comic book death|never staying 'dead']].

Valley was also not the only Azrael.  A Chinese man, supposedly given the same training as Valley, and an identical costume, was birefly under the control of a former member of the Order of St. Dumas.  Earlier on in the ''Azrael'' series, another man, presumably either American or European in ethnicity, was supposedly selected and trained in the same way as Valley and the Chinese Azrael, to be Valley's replacement.  He was defeated by Azrael, and supposedly fell to his death, only to resurface in Gotham at one point wearing one of Valley's 'Batman' armors and engaging in underground fights.  The exact whereabouts of this man are unknown.

The comic series '''Azrael''' was nominated for the [[Squiddy Award]] for Favorite Continuing Series in 1994.
