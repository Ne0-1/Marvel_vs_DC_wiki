The '''Ani-Mator''' ('''Dr. Frederick Animus''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
The Ani-Mator appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #59-60 (January-February 1988), and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Bret Blevins]].

The Ani-Mator received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
The Ani-Mator was a geneticist originally employed by [[Cameron Hodge]] to research a means of stopping the process that creates [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]].  Dr. Animus instead created a race of "Ani-Mates", which combined the characteristics of human beings and other animals, intending them to be a slave race for humanity.

One of the Ani-Mates, [[Bird-Brain]], escaped the Ani-Mator's island and ultimately befriends the [[New Mutants]]. The New Mutants returned to the island with Bird-Brain to stop the mad scientist's experiments.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #59</ref> They succeeded in defeating Animus' creations, but right afterwards they were captured by Hodge and agents of [[The Right (comics)|The Right]], who had become suspicious of the doctor's activities. Bird-Brain subsequently rallied the surviving Ani-Mates to help rescue his human friends.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #60</ref>

During the fight with the Right troopers, Animus broke free and procured a gun. He attempted to shoot and kill [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], whom - due to her shapeshifting power - he considered too valuable a specimen to be captured by the Right. But as he fired, he instead hit and killed [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], who had pushed Rahne out of the way. In retaliation, [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] exiled the Ani-Mator to the dimension of [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. Bird-Brain stayed on the island to help his animal friends.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #60</ref>
