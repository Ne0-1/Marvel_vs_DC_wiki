==Fictional character biography==
The Ani-Mator was a geneticist employed by [[Cameron Hodge]] to research a means of stopping the process that creates [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutants]].  Dr. Animus instead created a race of "Ani-Mates", which combined the characteristics of human beings and other animals, intending them to be a slave race for humanity.

One of the Ani-Mates, [[Bird-Brain]], escaped the Ani-Mator's island and ultimately befriends the [[New Mutants]]. The New Mutants return to the island with Bird-Brain to stop the mad scientist's experiments. They succeed in defeating Animus' creations, but right afterwards they are captured by Hodge and agents of [[The Right (comics)|The Right]], who had become suspicious of the doctor's activities. Bird-Brain rallies the surviving Ani-Mates to help rescue his human friends.

During the fight with the Right troopers, Animus breaks free and procures a gun. He attempts to shoot and kill [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], whom - due to her shapeshifting power - he considered too valuable a specimen to be captured by the Right. But as he fires, he instead hits and kills [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], who had pushed her out of the way. In retailiation [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] exiles the Ani-Mator to the dimension of [[Otherplace|Limbo]], where he has presumably perished. Bird-Brain stays on the island to help his animal friends.
