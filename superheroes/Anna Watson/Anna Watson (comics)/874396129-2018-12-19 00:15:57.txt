==Fictional character biography== 
Anna Watson is depicted as [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s aunt, an old friend of [[Aunt May]], and a recurring character in various [[Spider-Man]] titles. She is depicted as filling the same role of surrogate mother in Mary Jane's life as May does for [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. For a period of time when May was believed to be dead, she moved in with Peter and Mary Jane. While initially very supportive of her niece's husband, she becomes suspicious with Peter's long absences and unreliability occasionally.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spider-Man, Who??
