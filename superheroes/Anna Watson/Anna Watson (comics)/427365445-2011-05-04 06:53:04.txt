'''Anna Watson''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Universe]] and an supporting character of [[Spider-Man]]. She is  [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s aunt and [[Aunt May]]'s best friend. She was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
Anna Watson, the older sister of Mary Jane Watson's father, Philip Watson, always seemed to be an nice old lady and was best friend and always took care of Peter Parker's aunt [[Aunt May|May Parker]] She invited May to live with her so they could help each other out as they got older, she also set Peter up with Mary Jane, brought him some really good vegetable soup and comforted May when he left for college. Anna, unlike her friend May, tended to stay out of trouble when it came to New York's super criminals. That changed when she was kidnapped by the supervillain known as [[Alistair Smythe]], who thought he was taking [[Spider-Man]]'s aunt, to be used as bait. Mary Jane held on to her aunt as she was taken by Smythe's flying saucer, and later managed to convince Alistaire that she was actually Spider-Man. This managed to buy Peter enough time to find and rescue the Watsons. Aunt Anna stayed a close friend of the Parkers and moved in with Peter and MJ after May Parker "died." Living with Peter made Anna suspicious of his unusual comings and how he could be gone for days at a time. She also didn't trust his habit of making last minute changes in plans.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Anna kept confronting MJ with her concerns but Mary Jane was just glad that she hadn't discovered Peter's secret. Instead of accusing Peter of being Spider-Man, she believed that he was having an affair. Returning home that night after being under the control of [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], Peter was confronted by a furious Anna Watson. MJ, tired of her aunt's nonsense, told her that Peter was Spider-Man. Anna believed that Mary Jane made up the story of Peter being Spider-Man to show her how foolish she sounded for accusing him of having an affair. She apologized and confessed to Peter that she had been married to a man named Jacob Hilliard after moving out to California to become an actress. She was 19 years old and married Jacob, a radio writer, within a month of meeting him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Their romance quickly went stale and Anna soon met a singer named Johnny Dipalma while at an audition. He asked her to lunch and she soon convinced herself that she was in love. The guilt made her feel terrible. She stopped seeing Johnny and told Jacob the truth. She came back to New York and never told anyone that she had been married, not even May Parker.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She assumed that Peter hated her for accusing him of cheating on Mary Jane, but Peter said he loved her and he had nothing to forgive her for. She returned to [[Florida]] after May was revealed to be alive, though she still stops to visit May and have tea.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She took part with [[Madame Web]] to contact the comatose May after she was shot by a sniper hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Oddly, she didn't rush off to save May when Peter sensed that she was in danger from [[Eddie Brock]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}
