The '''Trapster''' ('''Peter Petruski'''), originally known as '''Paste Pot Pete''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]].

==Publication history==
The Trapster is one of the first supervillains who became active during the "Silver Age" of Marvel Comics.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2009}}
Peter Petruski was born in [[Gary, Indiana]].  Originally calling himself '''Paste-Pot-Pete''', the villain and professional criminal clashed with the [[Human Torch]] during his efforts to sell a new American missile to the Soviets.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #104</ref>

Following failed solo efforts against the Torch when trying to steal a missile though he escaped, Pete teamed with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in efforts to trump his youthful foe. They got the Torch to the Wizard's house and used compressed air to force him into a chamber of steel mirrors, planning to fill the place with a gas that would cut off the oxygen supply of the Torch. However the Torch melted through the paste that held him to the floor, created a flaming duplicate to fool the two, then increased his flame enabling him to burn through the mirrors. The villains only realized this deception when the fake Torch faded away due to the gas, by which time the Torch had regained his flame and captured the two in a flaming ring.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #110</ref> Pete later provided the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with a solvent to dissolve [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s Adhesive-X, and was paroled from prison.<ref>''Avengers'' #6</ref> He adopted a new costume and weaponry, and battled the Human Torch and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] using new paste types. He captured the Thing, then the Torch, but was still defeated.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #124</ref> The Wizard and Pete would eventually team with the criminal [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] as the [[Frightful Four]] to battle the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #36</ref> It was shortly after the formation of the Frightful Four that Pete abandoned his old alias and assumed the more intimidating Trapster (the "Spider-Man/Human Torch" miniseries depicts the catalyst of the name change to be Spider-Man being unable to stop laughing when Paste Pot Pete introduced himself). The Frightful Four would clash time and again with the Fantastic Four, often enjoying some measure of success in their efforts. Over the years, the membership of the Frightful Four would vary, but the man once known as Paste-Pot-Pete would serve in virtually every incarnation in which Wizard served as well, loyal to his longtime boss.

He changed his nom de crime to '''The Trapster''' and appeared with new weaponry in ''Fantastic Four'' #38, with the second appearance of the Frightful Four, in an attempt to make himself sound more formidable. In this encounter, the Frightful Four was able to defeat the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #38</ref>  Over the years, a running gag in Marvel comics involved heroes and villains alike reminding Trapster of his earlier name of "Paste-Pot-Pete" — which would inevitably send him flying into a rage.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} A chance encounter with [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]] once prevented the Frightful Four's takeover of Fantastic Four headquarters.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #116</ref> With the Frightful Four, he soon battled the Fantastic Four again,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #41-43</ref> and then battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #35-36</ref> He was hired by the [[Red Skull]] to acquire information from [[Sharon Carter]]., and battled [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #108</ref> Alongside the Wizard and Sandman, he later battled Medusa.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #15</ref> Together with the Wizard, Sandman, and Medusa as the Frightful Four again, they once again battled the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #94</ref>

Trapster has often sought independent recognition, battling virtually every "street-level" hero in the Marvel Universe either by design or by opposition to some criminal scheme.  Trapster once even defeated [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] in single combat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}  The victory proved short-lived, as [[Doctor Doom]] interrupted his fight in a campaign of his own against Daredevil, and shortly thereafter the hero would avenge his defeat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Trapster also attempted to raid the [[Baxter Building]] (just before it was destroyed by [[Kristoff Vernard|Doctor Doom II]]) while the Fantastic Four were away participating in the [[Secret Wars]], but embarrassingly fell victim to the security systems and the robot receptionist, thus becoming the first villain to be defeated by an empty building.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}  However, he had a moment appreciated by the heroes when he was convinced to free Captain America, who was snared by [[Baron Heinrich Zemo]]'s powerful Adhesive X, by inventing the first ever means to neutralize the previously uncounterable chemical.

Saddened by constant defeats, Trapster would seek out the [[Tinkerer]]'s aid in redesigning his arsenal. Adding wrist-pumps for his glue weaponry and a bandolier of various explosives and gimmicks, Trapster joined forces with the mutant villain [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] in a bid to defeat [[Captain America]]. Despite his improved arsenal, both villains were defeated.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

The Trapster found his moment of victory over [[Spider-Man]] when he teamed up with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] but before the duo could finish Spider-Man off, their employers said their payment would be doubled if they left Spider-Man alone and they complied. He would later defeat Spider-Man in one-on-one combat after being enlisted to battle the wall-crawler as part of the [[Acts of Vengeance]] conspiracy; it was only through merest quirk of fate that Spider-Man even survived the battle. However, when the Trapster learned of Spider-Man's survival and returned to finish the job, he would find the web-slinger now in possession of cosmic powers (eventually revealed to be a manifestation Uni-Power) with which Pete was easily defeated.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #158</ref>

Later on, during the ''[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' story, the Trapster would be hired by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to kill a man and make it seem like Spider-Man did it, and in order to cover this up Osborn put a price on Trapster's head, attracting assassins like the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] and his previous ally Shocker.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #91</ref> Trapster unknowingly teamed up with Spider-Man - who was using the alias of [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], reasoning that the currently-lone Trapster would need an ally and someone to talk to in his currently vulnerable state - in an attempt to get back at Osborn, and would eventually confess his murder to the police in order to remove Osborn's reason for wanting him dead (although he kept the identity of his employer secret in case he needed it later).<ref>''Spider-Man'' #92</ref>

During his tenure with a later Frightful Four incarnation (including [[Hydro-Man]] and the mysterious Salamandra), the Wizard, tired of Trapster's failures and his general sniveling, callously sealed the villain in a repeating time-loop, a trap from which he can "never escape." However, Petruski did indeed escape.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

During the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' storyline,  Trapster was enlisted by [[Lucia von Bardas]], the former prime minister of [[Latveria]] and placed in her secret army of technology-based villains. She sent the army against [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Spider-Man, [[Luke Cage]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]], the five heroes [[Nick Fury]] had sent to Latveria to stop Lucia’s secret criminal funding. When the battle started to turn in favor of the heroes, Lucia turned all the armor of her technology army into a bomb. Nick’s unknown agent Daisy defeated her and the armor army’s lives were saved. Pete escaped the heroes in the resulting battle between Nick Fury and Wolverine.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

He was among an army of supervillains organized by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] that was captured by [[Iron Man]] during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1</ref>

After the Civil War, Trapster appeared as a member of a new 'Frightful Five', along with Wizard, [[Hydro-Man]], [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #546</ref>

He appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar, and later fighting Spider-Man in the ''Brand New Day'' Extra one-shot.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Trapster later showed up in an alliance with the criminal named [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Zodiac'' #1-3</ref>

===Trapster II===
A different Trapster appeared in ''Iron Man Annual'' #12. Lawrence "Larry" Curtiss was known as "Trapster". He was the assistant head of security for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] and stole the costume and weapons of Petruski. He also had heat-seeking mini-missiles equipped with concussion charges and glue missiles (fired from paste-shooters). He used the Trapster's equipment to steal the inventions programs from [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and desired to replace his boss as the head of security at Roxxon. However, he was discovered by his boss and defeated by Iron Man.

==Powers and abilities==
The Trapster does not possess any superhuman powers, but relies on a variety of technological devices. He designed a costume of synthetic stretch fabric equipped with storage canisters for paste and lubricant, and adhesive-rigged boots and gloves to enable walking up walls. His primary weapon has always been projectile [[adhesive|glue]], initially delivered by a pistol connected by an armored tubing to a container on his person, then wrist paste-shooter cannons, and eventually shot straight from the tips of his gloves. He can shoot out a stream of liquid glue that immediately gels into a springy rope, allowing him to duplicate Spider-Man's web-shooters (to the point where he is the only person Spider-Man knows who can even create an approximate duplicate of his webbing). He was able to create a fire-proof paste.

Pete also has designed boots that allow him to walk up walls by sequentially releasing a powerful glue and then a solvent. Petruski has also created lubricants that can render a surface frictionless, and discovered a way to dissolve the extremely powerful "Adhesive X" created by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]].

Pete has also created a dust capable of rendering [[Mister Fantastic]]'s unstable molecules inert.

Trapster is an expert chemist, a skilled marksman, and a talented disguise artist.  He has used other devices such as anti-gravity discs, explosive caps, ultrasound transmitters, an anti-gravity platform, and various mechanical traps used to restrain or entangle opponents.

==Other versions==
===Marvel 1602===
A variation on the Trapster appears in ''[[Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four|1602: Fantastic Four]]'' as one of the members of the 1602 [[Frightful Four#1602|Frightful Four]]: "The Four who are Frightful". He is an expert huntsman, hence his name.
