The '''Trapster''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Character biography==

The Trapster is one of the first supervillains who became active during the "Silver Age" of Marvel Comics. Originally calling himself '''Paste-Pot-Pete''', the villain clashed with [[The Human Torch]] during his efforts to sell "Secrets to the Reds".  Many of the Silver Age villains were trying to cash in on the "Reds" unslakable thirst for "Secrets".

Following failed solo efforts against the Torch, Pete teamed with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in efforts to trump his youthful foe. The Wizard would eventually team Pete along with the criminal [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] as the [[Frightful Four]]. It was shortly before the formation of the Frightful Four that Pete abandoned his old alias and assumed the more intimidating Trapster. (The "Spider-Man/Human Torch" mini-series depicts the catalyst of the name change to be Spider-Man being unable to stop laughing when Paste Pot Pete introduced himself. This can most likely be considered canon, although the series was overall humorous) The Frightful Four would clash time and again with the [[Fantastic Four]], often enjoying some measure of success in their efforts. Over the years, the membership of the Frightful Four would vary, but Trapster would serve in every incarnation in which Wizard served as well, loyal to his longtime boss.

Trapster has often sought independent recognition, battling virtually every "street-level" hero in the Marvel Universe either by design or by opposition to some criminal scheme.  Trapster once even defeated [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] in single combat.  The victory proved short-lived, as [[Doctor Doom]] interrupted his fight in a campaign of his own against Daredevil, and shortly thereafter the hero would avenge his defeat. Trapster also attempted to raid the [[Baxter Building]] (just before it was destroyed by [[Kristoff Vernard|Doctor Doom II]]), but embarrassingly fell victim to the security systems and the robot receptionist, thus becoming the first villain to be defeated by an empty building.

Saddened by constant defeats, Trapster would seek out the [[Tinkerer]]'s aid in redesigning his arsenal. Adding wrist-pumps for his glue weaponry and a bandolier of various explosives and gimmicks, Trapster joined forces with the mutant villain Whirlwind in a bid to defeat [[Captain America]]. Despite his improved arsenal, both villains were defeated.

The Trapster found his moment of victory over [[Spider-Man]] when he teamed up with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] but before the villain duo could finish Spidey off, their employees said their payment would be doubled if they left Spider-Man alone and they complied. Later on, during the ''[[Spider-Man: Identity Crisis]]'' story, the Trapster would be hired by [[Norman Osborn]] to kill a man and make it seem like Spider-Man did it, and in order to cover this up Osborn put a price on Trapster's head, attracting assassins like the Hand and his previous ally Shocker. Trapster unknowingly teamed up with Spider-Man, who was using the alias of [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], in an attempt to get back at Osborn, and would eventually confess his murder to the police in order to remove Osborn's reason for wanting him dead.

During his tenure with the most recent Frightful Four incarnation (including [[Hydro-Man]] and the mysterious [[Salamandra]]), the Wizard tired of Trapster's failures and his general snivelling, and callously sealed the villain in a repeating time-loop, a trap from which he can "never escape." However, Petruski did indeed escape.

He was recently among an army of super-villains organized by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] that was captured by [[Iron Man]] during Marvel's Civil War storyline.

==Powers and abilities==
The Trapster does not possess any superhuman powers, but relies on a variety of technological devices. His primary weapon has always been projectile [[glue]], initially delivered by a gun, then wrist cannons, and most recently from the tips of his gloves. He can shoot out a stream of liquid glue that immediately gels into a springy rope, allowing him to duplicate Spider-Man's web-shooters.
Pete also has designed boots that allow him to walk up walls by sequentially releasing a powerful glue and then a solvent. Petruski has also created lubricants that can render a surface frictionless, and discovered a way to dissolve the extremely powerful "Adhesive X" created by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]].

Pete has also created a dust capable of rendering [[Mister Fantastic]]'s unstable molecules inert.

==Other Versions==
* A variation on the Trapster appears in [[1602: Fantastick Four]] as one of the members of the 1602 [[Frightful Four]]: "The Four who are Frightful". He is an expert huntsman, hence his name.
*A different Trapster appeared in ''Iron Man Annual'' #12. Lawrence "Larry" Curtiss was known as "Trapster". He was a [[Roxxon]] employee and stole the costume and weapons of Petruski.  He used them to steal the inventions programs from [[Tony Stark]] and desired to replace his boss as the head of security at Roxxon.  However he was discovered by his boss and defeated by Iron Man.
