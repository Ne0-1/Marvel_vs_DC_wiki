'''Fer-de-Lance''' ('''Teresa Vasquez''') is a fictional [[super villain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Fer-de-Lance first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #337 (January 1988) and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Tom Morgan (comics)|Tom Morgan]].

==Fictional character biography==
Teresa Vasquez was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Hired as a personal assassin for the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], Fer-de-Lance and her allies [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]], and [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], the fourth [[Serpent Squad]], pulled a number of bank heists in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Fer-de-Lance was trained in battle with razor-edged claws that retract from her gloves and boots. During one of their casino robberies, [[Captain America]] and his allies [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Jack Monroe (comics)|Nomad]], and [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition-Man]] intervened and defeated the group of professional criminals, placing them in jail.<ref>''Captain America'' #337</ref>  Soon after, Fer-de-Lance and the others were rescued by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]],<ref>''Captain America'' #338</ref> and initiated into the [[Serpent Society]]. However, she was secretly a double agent of the Viper, and enabled the Viper to teleport into Serpent Society headquarters.<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref>

Fer-de-Lance feigned a friendship with [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] during her first night with the Serpent Society, but quickly turned on her when Viper's scheme to overthrow Sidewinder as leader of the criminal organization succeeded. Betraying Sidewinder and Diamondback, Fer-de-Lance was the first to find the pair hiding in a control room. During the skirmish, Fer-de-Lance lunged at Diamondback, who promptly dodged her attack. Fer-de-Lance, pressing her retractable razors into a computer, suffered an electric shock and was defeated.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-342</ref>  After Viper abandoned the group of mercenaries, Fer-de-Lance continued to serve with the Serpent Society.

During one mission with the Serpent Society, Fer-de-Lance and her comrades Copperhead and Diamondback were ambushed by the mysterious [[Mister Jip]].  Later, at Diamondback's trial, Fer-de-Lance voted guilty.<ref>''Captain America'' #380</ref>  After Diamondback escaped, Fer-de-Lance and [[Cottonmouth (Burchell Clemens)|Cottonmouth]] were sent to spy on the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] headquarters.  They later returned to the Serpent Citadel, but were attacked by Captain America, who shattered Fer-de-Lance's razors. After the battle, she and Cottonmouth, along with the defeated Serpent Society members [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]], [[Bushmaster (comics)|Bushmaster]], [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]], and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]] were sent to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America'' #382</ref>

Subsequently, Fer-de-Lance has also appeared with the Serpent Society as they battled [[Jack Flag]], but was defeated by [[Force Works]].<ref>''Captain America'' #434-437</ref> Most recently, Fer-de-Lance was seen with the group as they attempted to exact revenge on Diamondback for her earlier betrayal, and auction Captain America off to several of his enemies. Captain America eventually escaped, and together with Diamondback defeated Fer-de-Lance and the Serpent Society.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 4 #30-31</ref>

She appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in The Bar With No Name.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #563</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Fer-de-Lance rejoined the Serpent Society. The Society held a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the [[American Midwest]] claiming they were protecting themselves from the [[Skrull]]s. However, they were easily defeated by [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and his new [[Nova Corps]].<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #19</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Fer-de-Lance appears as a member of [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]'s Serpent Society under its new name Serpent Solutions.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Fer-de-Lance was with Serpent Solutions at the time when they are recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join his Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16</ref>
