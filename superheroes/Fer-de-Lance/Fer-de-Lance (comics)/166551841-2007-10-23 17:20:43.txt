'''Fer-de-Lance''' ('''Teresa Vasquez''') is a [[super villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]] who first appeared in ''Captain America'' #337 (January 1988).  She was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Tom Morgan (comics)|Tom Morgan]] and is a member of the [[Serpent Society]].

==Fictional character biography==
Hired as a personal assassin for the [[Madame Hydra|Viper]], Fer-de-Lance and her allies [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Black Racer (comics)|Black Racer]], and [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], the fourth [[Serpent Squad]], pulled a number of bank heists in [[Las Vegas]].  Born in [[San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]], Fer-de-Lance was trained in battle with razor-edged claws that retract from her gloves and boots.  During one of their casino robberies, [[Captain America]] intervened and defeated the group of criminals, placing them in jail.  Soon after, Fer-de-Lance and the others were rescued by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] and initiated into the [[Serpent Society]].

Fer-de-Lance feigned a friendship with [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] during her first night with the Serpent Society, but quickly turned on her when Viper's scheme to overthrow Sidewinder as leader of the criminal organization succeeded.  Betraying Sidewinder and Diamondback, Fer-de-Lance was the first to find the pair hiding in a control room.  During the skirmish, Fer-de-Lance lunged at Diamondback, who promptly dodged her attack.  Fer-de-Lance, pressing her retractable razors into a computer, was quickly electrocuted and defeated.  After Viper abandoned the group of mercenaries, Fer-de-Lance continued to serve with the Serpent Society.

During one mission with the Serpent Society, Fer-de-Lance and her comrades Copperhead and Diamondback were ambushed by the mysterious [[Mr. Jip]].  Later, at Diamondback's trial, Fer-de-Lance voted guilty.  After Diamondback escaped, Fer-de-Lance and [[Cottonmouth (comics)|Cottonmouth]] were sent to spy on the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] headquarters.  They later returned to the Serpent Citadel, but were attacked by Captain America, who shattered Fer-de-Lance's razors.  After the battle, she and Cottonmouth, along with the defeated Serpent Society members [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], [[Bushmaster (comics)|Bushmaster]], [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], [[Black Racer (comics)|Black Racer]], and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]] were sent to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].

Subsequently, Fer-de-Lance has also appeared with the Serpent Society as they battled [[Jack Flag]], but was defeated by [[Force Works]].  Most recently, Fer-de-Lance was seen with the group as they attempted to exact revenge on Diamondback for her earlier betrayal, and auction Captain America off to several of his enemies.  Captain America eventually escaped, and together with Diamondback, defeated Fer-de-Lance and the Serpent Society.
