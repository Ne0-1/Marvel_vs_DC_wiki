'''Fer-de-Lance''' (real name '''Teresa Vasquez''') is a [[super villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]].

==Character Biography==
A member of the fourth [[Serpent Squad]] and the [[Serpent Society]], Fer-de-Lance, or Ferdy as she is so often called, is a professional assassin from [[Puerto Rico]].  A fierce woman with retractable razor-sharp "fangs" on each of her arms, she was chosen by [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] to infiltrate the Serpent Society which would allow her to take over leadership.

After robbing a casino in [[Las Vegas]], [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] quickly invited Fer-de-Lance and the others to join his group.  There, she feigned friendship with [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], but quickly turned on her once the plan was set in motion.  She found where Sidewinder and Diamondback were hiding, and attacked, but was electrocuted once her claw went into a computer machine.  However, after Viper's retreat, Fer-de-Lance continued on with the Serpent Society.  She, like fellow teammate [[Boomslang (comics)|Boomslang]], is notorious for failing to accomplish the majority of her tasks.  Presumably, she's currently still with the Society.
