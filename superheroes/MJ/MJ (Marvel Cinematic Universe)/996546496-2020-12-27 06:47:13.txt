'''Michelle''', also known as '''MJ''', is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] portrayed by [[Zendaya]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], an original character within the media franchise that pays homage to [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane "MJ" Watson]], a common love interest of Spider-Man in comic books and various media.<ref name="Zendaya1"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Cheeda |first1=Saim |title=Spider-Man: Mary Jane vs Michelle Jones: Who Is Better? |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-mary-jane-vs-michelle-jones-better/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=4 September 2020 |date=25 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Davison |first1=Josh |title=Spider-Man: 5 Ways MCU MJ Is Different From The Classic Version (& 5 How They're Exactly The Same) |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-mcu-mj-different-similar-classic-version/ |website= Comic Book Resources |accessdate=4 September 2020 |date=10 July 2020}}</ref>

She is depicted as a smart, snarky supporting character and classmate of [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', and serves as the main romantic interest for the titular superhero in ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', a unique aspect for original characters within the MCU franchise and upon [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' feature films]] preceding it.<ref name="Geek"/> Initially, Zendaya's role was the subject of controversy, due to the belief that an [[African American]] had been cast to portray Mary Jane Watson, though her portrayal of a revealed new character received favorable reviews after the first film's release as a strong female supporting cast member, additionally receiving the [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in the second film.

== Creation and concept ==
{{quote box|quote= She has a really cool wardrobe, really funny, lots of literary nods. I like the idea that she’s a real reader and bookish. She always has a big pile of books she’s carrying around, which I picked and obsessed over.|source=—[[Jon Watts]], director<ref name="\film"/> |width=33%}}
According to ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' co-screenwriter [[John Francis Daley]], MJ was intended as a reinvention of [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref name="yahoo!">{{cite news |last1=Alter |first1=Ethan |title=Your Complete Guide to the 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' Easter Eggs |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/explaining-spider-man-homecoming-easter-eggs-212204779.html |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] Entertainment |accessdate= September 3, 2020}}</ref> While her nickname reveal was an homage to the supporting character within the comic books and [[Spider-Man in other media|other Spider-Man media]], Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed she is an original [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |last1=Vejvoda |first1=Jim |title=Spider-Man: Homecoming Producers Say Twist to That Character Not What It Seems - IGN |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/spider-man-homecoming-producers-on-the-reveal-of-that-characters-nickname |accessdate=8 September 2020 |language=en
|quote= Well, we never even looked at it as a big reveal necessarily but more of just a fun homage to his past adventures and his past love. She's not Mary Jane Watson.

It wasn’t just Mary Jane Watson; it wasn’t just [[Gwen Stacy]]; it wasn’t just [[Harry Osborn]]. So we were very interested in the other characters, and that’s where [[Liz Allan|Liz]] came from and that’s where the version of the character Michelle came from."<ref name="DOG"/> [[Jon Watts]], director of  ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', likened the character to [[Ally Sheedy]]'s Allison Reynolds from ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' (1985) and [[Linda Cardellini]]'s Lindsay Weir from ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' (1999–2000).<ref name="\film"/>

[[File:Zendaya by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Zendaya portrays the character within the MCU.]]

MJ is portrayed by actress [[Zendaya]] within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as a student at [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown School of Science and Technology]], as one of [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]'s classmates and friends. Years after Liz Toomes' departure, she and Peter start a romantic relationship. MJ is snarky and coy, but also kind and friendly. She often acts as the voice of reason, and she provides Peter with comfort and advice.<ref name="Zendaya2"/><ref name="Vulture">{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Fair Warning: Zendaya Is Barely in Spider-Man: Homecoming |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/zendaya-is-barely-in-spider-man-homecoming.html |website=Vulture |accessdate=4 September 2020 |language=en-us |date=5 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="MEAWW">{{cite web|url=https://meaww.com/spider-man-far-from-home-mj-different-from-predecessors-perfect-zendaya-michele-jones |title=Spider-Man: Far from Home's MJ is vastly different from her predecessors and that's perfect|first1=Remus|last1=Noronha|website=Meaww.com|date=July 9, 2019}}</ref>

Her character is depicted as a brainy girl and a bookworm; Zendaya described her character as "very dry, awkward, intellectual", having an [[introvert]]ed personality because of her intelligence.<ref name="HR Zendaya Rumor"/> Unlike previous supporting female characters within [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' films]], such as [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]] from the [[Sam Raimi trilogy]] and [[Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Gwen Stacy]] from the [[The Amazing Spider-Man (film series)|''Amazing Spider-Man'' films]], MJ does not start off as a romantic interest. Instead, the character [[Liz Allan]] was created initially for the role of romantic interest to start off with until the [[Spider-Man: Far From Home|sequel]].<ref name="DS1"/><ref name="Geek">{{cite web |title=From Iron Man to Spider-Man — Ranking the Romances of the Marvel Cinematic Universe |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/marvel-cinematic-universe-romances-ranked-worst-best/ |website=Den of Geek |accessdate=4 September 2020 |date=11 February 2020}}</ref> MJ is not depicted as a [[damsel in distress]], unlike Mary Jane in the Raimi films, but like Gwen in the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' series, she is willing to aid Peter in his battles, putting herself in harm's way.<ref name="MEAWW" />

== Fictional character biography ==
Michelle, commonly known as MJ, is a student at [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown School of Science and Technology]] who initially enjoys mocking all of her fellow students there, including Peter Parker. Despite keeping her distance socially, MJ is eventually given the opportunity to take over from the departing [[Liz Allan|Liz Toomes]] as captain of the Academic Decathlon Team, and begins to open up more with her fellow teammates, which include [[Ned Leeds]] and Parker.

MJ, like Parker, is a victim of [[Avengers: Infinity War|the Snap]] by [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] in 2018, but along with all other victims, is resurrected in [[Avengers: Endgame|the Blip]] five years later. Her affections are sought out by Parker and Brad Davis during Midtown Tech's trip to Europe. When she deduces Parker's identity as Spider-Man, MJ helps discover [[Mysterio]]'s fraudulence, by exposing him as the one who staged the Elemental crisis. Shortly after their trip to Europe, MJ and Parker begin dating. After their first date, MJ is horrified when [[Daily Bugle|TheDailyBugle.net]]'s [[J. Jonah Jameson]] releases a [[fake news|doctored video]] of Mysterio and Spider-Man, claiming that Spider-Man is responsible for the casualties of the Battle of [[London]] while exposing Parker as Spider-Man.

== Reception ==
===Casting controversy===
According to news media, after the announcement of Zendaya being cast, there was much controversy and speculation sparked on the fact that [[Zendaya]], an [[African American]] actress, would be portraying [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref name="HR Zendaya Rumor"/><ref name="msnbc">{{cite web |last1=Howard |first1=Adam |title='Spider-Man' Zendaya casting controversy revives racial tensions |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/spider-man-casting-controversy-revives-racial-tensions-n637111 |website=NBC News |accessdate=4 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Media even came out on the defense of the issue, along with another [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] director [[James Gunn]] in [[social media]].<ref name="The daily beast">{{cite web |last1=Yamato |first1=Jen |title=Zendaya, ‘Spider-Man Homecoming,’ and the Beauty of A Black Mary Jane |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/zendaya-spider-man-homecoming-and-the-beauty-of-a-black-mary-jane |website=The Daily Beast |accessdate=4 September 2020 |language=en |date=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="msnbc"/> Zendaya responded to the rumors of her character as Mary Jane by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in an interview saying: <blockquote> Whenever we were on set, one of us gets some random character name [on the call sheet]. [Bloggers were] like, "Oh they must be so and so." And we just crack up about it, because it's like, 'Whatever you want to think. You'll find out.' It's funny to watch the guessing game. But of course there's going to be outrage over that because for some reason some people just aren't ready. I'm like, "I don't know what [[United States|America]] you live in, but from what I see when I walk outside my streets of [[New York City|New York]] right now, I see lots of diversity and I see the real world and it's beautiful, and that's what should be reflected and that's what is reflected so you're just going to have to get over it."<ref name="HR Zendaya Rumor"/> 
</blockquote>

She also confirmed that despite the  confusion, she is "100% Michelle" and not Mary Jane as many have speculated.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Crystal |title=Zendaya Says Her Spider-Man Character Is ‘100 Percent’ Michelle, Not Mary Jane |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/video/3010948/zendaya-spider-man-michelle-not-mary-jane/ |website=MTV News |accessdate=4 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

===Portrayal reaction ===
The character of MJ had a positive reception in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming|Homecoming]]'' by film critics, with Zendaya referred to as a "scene stealer" in her first major film role, despite her limited screen-time.<ref name="HR Defore">{{cite web |last1=DeFore |first1=John |title='Spider-Man: Homecoming': Film Review {{!}} Hollywood Reporter |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/spider-man-homecoming-review-1017796 |website=www.hollywoodreporter.com |accessdate=3 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web |last1=Collin |first1=Robbie |title=Spider-Man: Homecoming review: the web-slinger's gizmo-heavy John Hughes homage is too cobwebby for comfort |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/spider-man-homecoming-review-web-slingers-gizmo-heavy-john-hughes/ |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=3 September 2020 |date=30 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Duralde |first1=Alonso |title='Spider-Man: Far From Home' Film Review: Tom Holland Goes to Holland -- and Italy and Britain -- in Globe-trotting Marvel Romp |url=https://www.thewrap.com/spider-man-far-from-home-film-review-tom-holland-jake-gyllenhaal-2019/ |website=TheWrap |accessdate=3 September 2020 |date=2 July 2019}}</ref> Caitlin Busch of ''[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]''  felt thankful that the character was not Mary Jane Watson and opined that the original character works better for the film.<ref name="Inverse">{{cite web |last1=Busch |first1=Caitlin |title=Zendaya Isn't Mary Jane in 'Spider-Man: Homecoming', She's Better |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/34344-spider-man-homecoming-zendaya-michelle-mary-jane-watson-mj |website=Inverse |accessdate=4 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Karen Han of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt that the character was a positive representation of strong female characters while additionally ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' noted how MJ was not portrayed as a warrior like [[Hayley Atwell]]'s [[Peggy Carter]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]]'s [[Malice (comics)|Nakia]] or [[Evangeline Lilly]]'s [[Hope van Dyne]] but also not a damsel and declared her as the "MJ we both need and deserve".<ref name="Polygon">{{cite web |last1=Han |first1=Karen |title=Spider-Man: Far From Home’s deadpan take on MJ is the heroine we need |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/5/20683227/spider-man-far-from-home-mj-character-zendaya |website=Polygon |accessdate=4 September 2020 |language=en |date=5 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Joanna |title=Spider-Man: Far From Home: Zendaya, the Black Dahlia Murders, and the MJ We Deserve |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/07/spider-man-black-dahlia-murder-mj-michelle-zendaya |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=3 September 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> Her personality was reminiscent to as [[Daria Morgendorffer]] in ''[[Daria]]'' to some reporters.<ref name="Polygon"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Paige |first1=Rachel |title=Spider-Man, Zendaya, & The Mary Jane Of It All |url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/235902/is-zendaya-mj-mary-jane-in-spider-man-movies |website=[[Refinery29]] |accessdate=3 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Rachel Leishman of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' described the MCU version of MJ as extremely important in [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]'s life.<ref name="Mary Sue">{{cite web |last1=Leishman |first1=Rachel |title=The MCU Version of "MJ" Is Extremely Important |url=https://www.themarysue.com/the-mcu-mj/ |website=www.themarysue.com |accessdate=4 September 2020}}</ref>
