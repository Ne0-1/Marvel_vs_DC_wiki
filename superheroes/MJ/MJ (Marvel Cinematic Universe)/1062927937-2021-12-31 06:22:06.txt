'''Michelle Jones-Watson''', most commonly known as '''MJ''', is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[Zendaya]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], an original character within the media franchise that pays homage to [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane "MJ" Watson]], a recurring love interest of [[Spider-Man]] in comic books and various media.<ref name="Zendaya1"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Cheeda |first1=Saim |title=Spider-Man: Mary Jane vs Michelle Jones: Who Is Better? |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-mary-jane-vs-michelle-jones-better/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=September 4, 2020 |date=November 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Davison |first1=Josh |title=Spider-Man: 5 Ways MCU MJ Is Different From The Classic Version (& 5 How They're Exactly The Same) |url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-mcu-mj-different-similar-classic-version/ |website= Comic Book Resources |access-date=September 4, 2020 |date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>

She is depicted as a smart, snarky classmate of [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', and becomes his love interest in the sequel ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'', a unique aspect for original characters within the MCU franchise and upon [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' feature films]] preceding it.<ref name="Geek"/>  She returns in ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021), helping Peter, Ned and [[Doctor Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe character)|Doctor Strange]] to capture multiple villains that have entered their universe from the multiverse. Her romantic involvement in Peter's personal life would eventually be undone due to Strange's casting of the "Runes of Kauf-Kaul", a spell which permanently erased the world's memory of Parker's civilian persona, including the loss of his previous bonds he forged with his friends, loved ones, and allies.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 13, 2020|title=MCU Spider-Man 3: Zendaya Confirmed To Return As MJ|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-spiderman-3-cast-zendaya-mj-return/|access-date=April 21, 2021|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref> Initially, Zendaya's role was the subject of controversy, due to the belief that an [[African American]] had been cast to portray Mary Jane Watson, though her portrayal received positive reviews after ''Homecoming's'' release as a strong female supporting cast member, additionally receiving the [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''Far From Home''.

==Creation and concept==

According to ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' co-screenwriter [[John Francis Daley]], MJ was intended as a reinvention of [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref name="yahoo!">{{cite news |last1=Alter |first1=Ethan |title=Your Complete Guide to the 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' Easter Eggs |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/explaining-spider-man-homecoming-easter-eggs-212204779.html |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] Entertainment |access-date= September 3, 2020}}</ref> While her nickname reveal was an homage to the supporting character within the comic books and [[Spider-Man in other media|other Spider-Man media]], Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed she is an original [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] character.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |last1=Vejvoda |first1=Jim |title=Spider-Man: Homecoming Producers Say Twist to That Character Not What It Seems - IGN |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/spider-man-homecoming-producers-on-the-reveal-of-that-characters-nickname |access-date=September 8, 2020 |language=en

It wasn't just Mary Jane Watson; it wasn't just [[Gwen Stacy]]; it wasn’t just [[Harry Osborn]]. So we were very interested in the other characters, and that’s where [[Liz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Liz]] came from and that’s where the version of the character Michelle came from."<ref name="DOG"/> [[Jon Watts]], director of  ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'', likened the character to [[Ally Sheedy]]'s Allison Reynolds from ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' (1985) and [[Linda Cardellini]]'s Lindsay Weir from ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' (1999–2000).<ref name="\film"/>

The character's full name is Michelle Jones-Watson, which was first revealed in ''Spider-Man: No Way Home''. Until that point, she had been referred to once as Michelle and primarily known by the nickname MJ; although the name "Michelle Jones" had previously been reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' to be used internally by Marvel Studios for the character, the name was not used in any official media until ''No Way Home''.<ref name="FullName" />

== Portrayal and characterization ==
[[File:Zendaya by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Zendaya portrays the character within the MCU.]]

MJ is portrayed by actress [[Zendaya]] within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as a student at [[Midtown High School (comics)|Midtown School of Science and Technology]], as one of [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]'s classmates and friends. Years after Liz's departure (due to both MJ and Peter [and Ned} getting blipped), she and Peter start a romantic relationship. MJ is snarky and coy, but also kind and friendly. She often acts as the voice of reason, and she provides Peter with comfort and advice.<ref name="Zendaya2"/><ref name="Vulture">{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Fair Warning: Zendaya Is Barely in Spider-Man: Homecoming |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/zendaya-is-barely-in-spider-man-homecoming.html |website=Vulture |access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en-us |date=July 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name="MEAWW">{{cite web|url=https://meaww.com/spider-man-far-from-home-mj-different-from-predecessors-perfect-zendaya-michele-jones |title=Spider-Man: Far from Home's MJ is vastly different from her predecessors and that's perfect|first1=Remus|last1=Noronha|website=Meaww.com|date=July 9, 2019}}</ref>

Her character is depicted as an intelligent girl and a [[bookworm]]; Zendaya described her character as "very dry, awkward, intellectual", having an [[introvert]]ed personality because of her intelligence.<ref name="HR Zendaya Rumor"/> Unlike previous supporting female characters within [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' films]], such as [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]] from the [[Sam Raimi trilogy]] and [[Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Gwen Stacy]] from the [[The Amazing Spider-Man (film series)|''Amazing Spider-Man'' films]], MJ does not start off as a romantic interest. Instead, the character [[Liz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Liz]] was created initially for the role of romantic interest to start off with until the [[Spider-Man: Far From Home|sequel]].<ref name="DS1"/><ref name="Geek">{{cite web |title=From Iron Man to Spider-Man — Ranking the Romances of the Marvel Cinematic Universe |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/marvel-cinematic-universe-romances-ranked-worst-best/ |website=Den of Geek |access-date=September 4, 2020 |date=February 11, 2020}}</ref> Initially in the first two films, MJ is not depicted as a [[damsel in distress]], unlike [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|Mary Jane Watson]] in the Raimi films, but like [[Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Gwen Stacy]] in the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' series, she is willing to aid Peter in his battles, putting herself in harm's way and is also a brilliant student like the [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Mary Jane Watson.<ref name="MEAWW" /> In the third film, her portrayal was utilized as being rescued by [[Andrew Garfield]]'s [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|incarnation of Spider-Man]] being used as a dedication of a scene in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film series showing the attempted rescue and eventual demise of Gwen Stacy.<ref name="rescue">{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Evan |title=Everyone Has Been Wondering if a Certain Duo Appears in 'No Way Home' |url=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a38530752/spider-man-no-way-home-andrew-garfield-tobey-maguire/ |website=Men's Health |access-date=17 December 2021 |date=16 December 2021}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Captain of the Decathlon===
{{Further|Spider-Man: Homecoming}} 
In 2016, Michelle, commonly known as MJ, is introduced as a student at [[Midtown High School (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Midtown School of Science and Technology]] and enjoys mocking her classmates, including [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]. She is given the opportunity to take over from the departing [[Liz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Liz]] as captain of the Academic Decathlon Team, and begins to open up more with teammates, such as [[Ned Leeds (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ned Leeds]] and Parker.

In 2018, she falls victim to [[the Blip]], but later in 2023, she is restored to life.

===School vacation===
{{Further|Spider-Man: Far From Home}}
In 2024, MJ attends the school sponsored trip to Europe, where her affections are sought out by Parker and [[Brad Davis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brad Davis]]. When she deduces Parker's identity as Spider-Man, MJ helps discover [[Mysterio (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mysterio]]'s fraudulence, by exposing him to [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]] (actually the [[Skrull]]s [[Talos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Talos]] and [[Soren (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Soren]] in disguise) as the one who staged the [[Elementals (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Elemental]] invasion. Shortly after their trip to Europe, MJ and Parker begin a relationship, and have their first date by swinging in the city, when ''[[TheDailyBugle.net]]''{{'s}} [[J. Jonah Jameson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|J. Jonah Jameson]] releases a [[fake news|doctored video]] of Mysterio and Spider-Man sent to him by Mysterio's associates, claiming that Spider-Man is responsible for the Battle of London (during which Mysterio was killed) and exposing his identity as Parker.

===Multiverse invasion===
{{Further|Spider-Man: No Way Home}} 
After Parker is framed for the murder of Mysterio, MJ and Peter head back to Peter's aunt and caretaker [[May Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|May Parker]]'s house to escape the press. She is eventually interrogated and taken to custody by the [[Damage Control (comics)|Department of Damage Control]] along with May, Peter, and Ned. Attorney [[Matt Murdock (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Matt Murdock]] gets Peter's charges dropped, though MJ, Peter, and Ned become infamous, resulting in all their college applications being rejected. In response, Parker consults with [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] about a spell that would help people forget that he is Spider-Man, which Strange casts for him but goes awry and destabilizes due to many changing requirements, including keeping MJ's knowledge of her boyfriend's superhero identity. Peter is berated by Strange after revealing he did not attempt to contact [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] admissions before the spell was cast.

As Peter tracks down an MIT administrator to plead for her to accept Ned's and MJ's application, he discovers that the spell summoned several [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man foes]] from other realities who know Parker is Spider-Man. MJ and Ned help Parker track down the "visitors" of these universes. After they find out that Strange intends to send them straight back to their realities to certain death, Peter objects and after a struggle, takes the box containing the spell and placing it in MJ and Ned's care, as he opts to restore the villains to their human forms. In waiting for Peter to cure the villains, MJ and Ned accidentally create a portal from Strange's sling ring when they try to find Parker but instead find an [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|an alternate version]] of Peter (later code-named "Peter-Three") in one attempt and [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|another one]] (later code-named "Peter-Two") in another attempt. Ned and MJ find their own Parker on a rooftop and learn of May's death by the hands of [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|Norman Osborn]], which leads to MJ to comfort Parker. She introduces him to his alternate selves, who also provide advice.

In a standoff between the Spider-Men and their villains at the [[Statue of Liberty]], Ned and MJ protect the spell box as the Spider-Men battle their enemies together. MJ falls from the statue after a pumpkin bomb from Osborn detonates on the spell box, destabilizing the spell once more and threatening the fabric of reality. Parker from MJ's universe tries to save her but is whisked away by Osborn. She is then ultimately saved by Peter-Three, who had lost [[Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|his own girlfriend]] in a similar situation.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''}} Before long, Strange fixes the spell due to Peter requesting everyone forget his secret identity, sending the other Spider-Men and their villains back to their realities and preserving space-time. Peter and MJ confess their love for each other and kiss passionately before the spell is completed, but not before she and Ned make Peter promise to find them. Parker later tries to reintroduce himself to both MJ and Ned, but upon remembering the danger they would be in associating with him, finds himself unable to do so.

==Reception==
===Casting controversy===
[[File:Zendaya - 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Zendaya at the ''Spider-Man: Far From Home'' premiere in 2019]]
According to news media, after the announcement of Zendaya being cast, there was much controversy and speculation sparked on the fact that [[Zendaya]], an [[African American]] actress, would be portraying [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref name="HR Zendaya Rumor"/><ref name="msnbc">{{cite web |last1=Howard |first1=Adam |title='Spider-Man' Zendaya casting controversy revives racial tensions |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/spider-man-casting-controversy-revives-racial-tensions-n637111 |website=NBC News |access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Media outlets defended Zendaya over the issue, along with the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' film series director [[James Gunn]] on [[social media]].<ref name="The daily beast">{{cite web |last1=Yamato |first1=Jen |title=Zendaya, 'Spider-Man Homecoming,' and the Beauty of A Black Mary Jane |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/zendaya-spider-man-homecoming-and-the-beauty-of-a-black-mary-jane |website=The Daily Beast |access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en |date=August 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name="msnbc"/> Zendaya responded to the rumors of her character as Mary Jane by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in an interview saying: <blockquote> Whenever we were on set, one of us gets some random character name [on the call sheet]. [Bloggers were] like, "Oh they must be so and so." And we just crack up about it, because it's like, 'Whatever you want to think. You'll find out.' It's funny to watch the guessing game. But of course there's going to be outrage over that because for some reason some people just aren't ready. I'm like, "I don't know what America you live in, but from what I see when I walk outside my streets of New York right now, I see lots of diversity and I see the real world and it's beautiful, and that's what should be reflected and that's what is reflected so you're just going to have to get over it."<ref name="HR Zendaya Rumor"/> 
</blockquote>

Zendaya also confirmed that despite the confusion, she is "100% Michelle" and not Mary Jane as many had speculated.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Crystal |title=Zendaya Says Her Spider-Man Character Is '100 Percent' Michelle, Not Mary Jane |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/video/3010948/zendaya-spider-man-michelle-not-mary-jane/ |website=MTV News |access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> However Michelle is revealed to be nicknamed "MJ" in ''Homecoming'', by which she is known for the entirety of ''Far From Home'', while her full name is revealed to be Michelle Jones-Watson IN ''No Way Home'', with an [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|alternate Peter Parker]] referring to her as the counterpart to his [[Mary Jane Watson (Sam Raimi film series)|MJ (Mary Jane Watson)]], confirming her as an adaptation of the character.

===Portrayal reaction ===
The character of MJ had a positive reception in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming|Homecoming]]'' by film critics, with Zendaya referred to as a "scene stealer" in her first major film role, despite her limited screen-time.<ref name="HR Defore">{{cite web |last1=DeFore |first1=John |title='Spider-Man: Homecoming': Film Review {{!}} Hollywood Reporter |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/spider-man-homecoming-review-1017796 |website=www.hollywoodreporter.com |access-date=September 3, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web |last1=Collin |first1=Robbie |title=Spider-Man: Homecoming review: the web-slinger's gizmo-heavy John Hughes homage is too cobwebby for comfort |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/spider-man-homecoming-review-web-slingers-gizmo-heavy-john-hughes/ |website=The Telegraph |access-date=September 3, 2020 |date=June 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Duralde |first1=Alonso |title='Spider-Man: Far From Home' Film Review: Tom Holland Goes to Holland -- and Italy and Britain -- in Globe-trotting Marvel Romp |url=https://www.thewrap.com/spider-man-far-from-home-film-review-tom-holland-jake-gyllenhaal-2019/ |website=TheWrap |access-date=September 3, 2020 |date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> Caitlin Busch of ''[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]''  felt thankful that the character was not Mary Jane Watson and opined that the original character works better for the film.<ref name="Inverse">{{cite web |last1=Busch |first1=Caitlin |title=Zendaya Isn't Mary Jane in 'Spider-Man: Homecoming', She's Better |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/34344-spider-man-homecoming-zendaya-michelle-mary-jane-watson-mj |website=Inverse |access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Karen Han of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt that the character was a positive representation of strong female characters while additionally ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' noted how MJ was not portrayed as a warrior like [[Hayley Atwell]]'s [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peggy Carter]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]]'s [[Nakia (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nakia]] or [[Evangeline Lilly]]'s [[Hope van Dyne]] but also not a damsel and declared her as the "MJ we both need and deserve".<ref name="Polygon">{{cite web |last1=Han |first1=Karen |title=Spider-Man: Far From Home's deadpan take on MJ is the heroine we need |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/5/20683227/spider-man-far-from-home-mj-character-zendaya |website=Polygon |access-date=September 4, 2020 |language=en |date=July 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Joanna |title=Spider-Man: Far From Home: Zendaya, the Black Dahlia Murders, and the MJ We Deserve |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/07/spider-man-black-dahlia-murder-mj-michelle-zendaya |website=Vanity Fair |access-date=September 3, 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> Her personality was reminiscent to as [[Daria Morgendorffer]] in ''[[Daria]]'' to some reporters.<ref name="Polygon"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Paige |first1=Rachel |title=Spider-Man, Zendaya, & The Mary Jane Of It All |url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/235902/is-zendaya-mj-mary-jane-in-spider-man-movies |website=[[Refinery29]] |access-date=September 3, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Rachel Leishman of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' described the MCU version of MJ as extremely important in [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]'s life.<ref name="Mary Sue">{{cite web |last1=Leishman |first1=Rachel |title=The MCU Version of "MJ" Is Extremely Important |url=https://www.themarysue.com/the-mcu-mj/ |website=www.themarysue.com |access-date=September 4, 2020}}</ref>
