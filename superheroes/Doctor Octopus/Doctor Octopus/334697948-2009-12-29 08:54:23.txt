'''Doctor Octopus''' ('''Dr. Otto Gunther Octavius''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] since 1963. A highly intelligent [[mad scientist]], Doctor Octopus is one of the greatest enemies of [[Spider-Man]] who is portrayed as a stocky, [[myopic]] man who utilizes four powerful, mechanical appendages, and is obsessed with proving his own genius and destroying [[Spider-Man]]. In his first several appearances, Dr. Octopus' last name was spelled "'''Octavious.'''"  All stories since have spelled it Octavius. Spider-Man has also nicknamed Octopus as '''Doc Ock'''. Creator Stan Lee has said that Doctor Octopus is one of his favorite Spider-Man villains. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man cartoons and video games and was portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]] in the [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand|date=September 2008}}
The character of Doctor Octopus first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #3 ([[1963#July|July 1963]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York]], Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father, Torbert, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary, leading Otto to be shy and reclusive in school. Young Otto's shyness and good work in school got him targeted as a "teacher's pet" and a subject for [[bullying]]. Torbert Octavius did not appreciate having a bullied son, more for having to pay the bills for new pairs of eyeglasses than other things, and roared at Otto to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would defend her son from Torbert's [[tirade]]s, saying Otto was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. At his mother's insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in manual labor (clearly due to her abusive husband), Otto was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Otto's devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a [[university]] [[scholarship]]. During Otto's freshman year of college, his father's death due to an industrial accident pushed Otto towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science. After graduating from college, Otto Octavius found work in an engineering firm.

Otto became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], atomic research consultant, [[inventor]], and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced mechanical arms controlled via a [[brain-computer interface]] to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacle arms were resistant to [[radiation]] and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body. 

Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, a fellow researcher named Mary Alice Anders befriended him when Otto impressed her with a demonstration of his harness, explaining that he invented it for scientists to be able to handle dangerous chemicals from a safe distance, and the two began a courtship. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice, and joyfully announced to Mary that Dr. Anders is to become his bride. However, Otto's mother did not approve, believing that no woman was good enough for her son. To please her, he ended his engagement. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of Otto's mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work.

During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius' body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs<ref name="untoldtales">{{Citation | last = DeCandido   | first = Keith R.A. | authorlink = Keith R.A. DeCandido | editor = Stan Lee and Kurt Busiek | title = Untold Tales of Spider-Man | year = 1997 | publisher = Berkley Trade; Boulevard edition | chapter = Arms and the Man | isbn = 1572972947 }}</ref>), and the scientist turned to a life of crime.

Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is [[myopia|near-sighted]], with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man: in his first appearance he beat Spider-Man so badly that the wall-crawler considered giving up his heroic career,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #3</ref> until he was inspired to continue by the [[Human Torch]] at the time when the [[Fantastic Four]] were called in to fight Doctor Octopus.

Over the years Dr. Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of Spider-Man's rogues' gallery. He remains one of Spider-Man's most dangerous foes, having many legendary battles with him over the years. Doctor Octopus formed the original [[Sinister Six]] to fight Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups, and usually takes offense when some one else leads the team. Disguised as the Master Planner, he organized a theft of atomic equipment.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #31-32</ref>

Doctor Octopus later attempted to steal the Defense Department's Nullifier device, and set a trap for Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #53</ref> He became [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s tenant,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #54</ref> then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider-Man and rendered him amnesiac,<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #55</ref> and tricked Spider-Man into helping him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #56</ref>

Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely, and used them to free himself from prison.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #88</ref> His resulting battle with Spider-Man resulted in the death of Captain [[George Stacy]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #89-90</ref> Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #112-115</ref> He attempted to wed May Parker in order to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently unknowingly inherited.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131</ref> Doc Ock escaped death when the island was destroyed, and began a life as a homeless person never able to raise a gang again in fear of the ghost of Hammerhead.<ref>''Amazing Spiderman''#152, 154, 156</ref> He next battled the "ghost" of Hammerhead, and was able to return him to human form and defeat him after a temporary alliance with Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159</ref>

Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> He also attempted to poison New York City with printers' ink, and battled the [[Punisher]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #15</ref> He next battled the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]] and his gang.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #73, 75, 76</ref> He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #124</ref> He later displayed symptoms which [[Mister Fantastic]] diagnosed as multiple personality disorder.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #267</ref>  Doctor Octopus was taken to the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld, where he fought a horde of heroes.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12</ref>

His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of Spider-Man's then-partner, the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], who was placed in critical condition and led to Spider-Man beating "Doc Ock" to within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, and he needed to be treated for his acute arachnophobia.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #4-5</ref> Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save [[New York City]] from an exploding [[nuclear reactor]]; Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider-Man indirectly- as he currently turned catatonic with fear every time he saw Spider-Man, killing him in a straight fight was impractical at best-, but after his out-of-control arms beat Spider-Man seemingly senseless, Spider-Man convinced him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his 'great triumph, Octavius deciding to let Spider-Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #297</ref>

Doctor Octopus has worked with other super villains on several occasions, most notably as the leader of the original incarnation of the Sinister Six. He reformed the Sinister Six<ref>first in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #334</ref> more than once, and founded his own short-lived version of the [[Masters of Evil]] when his teammates from the Sinister Six proved too difficult to manipulate.

Despite the obvious obstacles, Octavius was for a time on good terms with Peter Parker's [[Aunt May]], whom he first met in ''The Amazing Spider-Man [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #1 (1964) when he abducted her and Peter's then-girlfriend [[Betty Brant]] to attract Spider-Man's attention. In fact, in later years May Parker and Otto Octavius were briefly engaged to be married as part of Octavius's attempts to gain control of a nuclear power facility May had unknowingly inherited control of, but their wedding was interrupted by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].

During the [[Clone Saga]], Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death due to a poison injected by [[Vulture (comics)|the Vulture]], although this was only because he desired to be the one to kill Spider-Man. During the healing process he discovered the identity of Spider-Man and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover [[Stunner (comics)|Stunner]]. But Stunner was knocked out and Doc Ock was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named [[Kaine]]. Octavius' student [[Lady Octopus|Carolyn Trainer]] took over as "Doctor Octopus" until the original was resurrected by a branch of the mystical [[ninja]] cult known as [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]]. Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he had no knowledge of Spider-Man's identity. The reason was that the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer with his recorded memories; that recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death.

In recent years, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed "[[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Spider-Woman]]", and was involved in a plot involving using [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] limbs as mind-control devices, to create an army of minions. He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of an arrogant young businessman and con artist named [[Carlyle (Marvel Comics)|Carlyle]], who pretended to employ Octavius at his company. This, however, proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius' harness. During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doc Ock ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle's suit with webbing.

Then, Dr. Octopus took the ambassador of the newly-formed Free Palestinian State hostage, demanding that in exchange for the ambassador's freedom, Spider-Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world. When Spider-Man went to Times Square, he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask, angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service. 

Dr. Octopus was taken into Ryker's Island and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the [[Green Goblin]]. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event.

He broke out of jail but was returned there after being defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Invincible (comics)|Invincible]].

Octavius unsuccessfully tries to form and lead another version of the [[Sinister Six]], because [[Captain America]]'s [[Civil War (comic book)|Secret Avengers]] managed to defeat the villainous group, although Ock himself eludes authorities. In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #28, Dr. Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Ock then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in one of their first encounters (at the time, Peter was severely weakened by a bad case of flu and Octavius assumed he was an impostor). He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Dr. Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius. He is then sent to [[Baron Zemo]]'s super-villain detention facility (as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #104 and ''[[Iron Man]]'' Vol IV #14). He is one of the ex-super villains trying to hunt down the renegade super heroes.

In "One More Day" Part 2, Octavius is one of the people Spider-Man contacted to see if he could help with Aunt May's condition; although no speech is given in each of the panels, he most likely did not have a clue, like the others, of what to do, and probably felt sorry for Peter's dilemma because of his near-marriage to May.

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Doctor Octopus has learned that after all his battles, and injuries suffered, his body is failing, giving him only months left to live. He has now modified himself, to be mentally connected to his own army of miniature octopus robots, and adding four more legs to his harness. His goal then became to use his abilities to take over the utilities of New York City, and turn it into a paradise under his control, though his mind's subconscious also targeted Spider-Man, and disrupted the wedding plans of his ex, Aunt May. Spider-Man and the Human Torch eventually track down his base, save the captive J. Jonah Jameson Sr. (May's fiancee), [[Carlie Cooper]], and [[Norah Winters]], and finally destroy Doctor Octopus' hold over the city. Doctor Octopus is then able to escape (still holding power over his mini-bots) and vows a "terrible revenge".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #600</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Octavius is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], and he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]] in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader.

Due to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has the mental ability to control his four, electrically powered, telescoping, [[Prehensility|prehensile]], titanium-steel, artificial, tentacle arms (even when they are not connected to him, he can also control them over vast distances), that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. These arms are capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages is enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like Spider-Man, or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine.

Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.

===Harnesses===
Dr. Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] harness, and the current harness, with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' miniseries. His current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense but light weight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the Hulk into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.

Eventually, Dr. Octopus' harness was surgically removed, but he was still able to control it mentally, even at a distance. This power was initially explained as having been caused by the initial accident; Octopus and his arms were fused together mentally, as well as physically. In fact, when the original harness was destroyed it caused Octavius excruciating pain.  He was seen sweating profusely and screaming.  Later stories suggest that Octavius possessed minor telepathic powers that gave him a direct mental link with his harness. These telepathic powers were also hinted at to have caused a brain [[aneurysm]] in his father when they first developed during puberty.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality created by the [[Scarlet Witch]], Otto Octavius makes an appearance as a researcher for the government, studying stem cells.

=== Marvel Zombies ===
On Earth-2149 (a world in which almost all heroes and villains are zombies) an undead Doctor Octopus first appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' series alongside several other zombie supervillains attempting to kill and devour the invading [[Galactus]]; this incarnation of Doctor Octopus is apparently destroyed piecemeal by several cosmically powered hero zombies after he got in the way of an attack they were aiming at Galactus.<ref> {{Cite comic

In the prequel series to ''Marvel Zombies'', ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' and ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'', the zombie Doctor Octopus makes few [[cameo appearance]]s, as a member of the undead Sinister Six.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] alternate [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|continuity]], it is revealed that Doctor Octopus attacked the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' shortly after the disappearance/retirement of Spider-Man, killing editor-in-chief [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]]. This motivates ''Bugle'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to initiate "Project: Human Fly", an attempt to create a government controlled superhero. Mercenaries (later revealed to be in the employ of Doctor Octopus) attempt to steal the Human Fly suit, but are thwarted when Jameson's grandson takes the suit (the controls of which bond to the first user) and becomes the superhero [[The Buzz (comics)|The Buzz]]. The Buzz and [[Spider-Girl]] eventually apprehend Doctor Octopus, who—now being struck with cancer—falls into a coma from which he is not expected to recover.

Later, the mantle of Doctor Octopus is taken up by [[Lady Octopus]].

===Noir Doctor Octopus===
In the ''[[Spider-Man Noir]]'' series, , his name however first appears in the ''Daily Bugle'' newspaper near the end of issue 4 as one of the scientists set to find the "Lost City of Atlatas'.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  He appears in person in issue one of the sequel series, "Eyes Without a Face".  Here, he is a doctor working in a facility on [[Ellis Island]].  His legs are crippled and withered, and he travels in a wheelchair with six long metal claw-like tentacles sticking out.  He is officially conducting experiments on primates, to study their brains in connection with evolution, and in the end, it is shown he is secretly taking in kidnapped black people for his own more secret experiments.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

===Spider-Man: India===
In ''[[Spider-Man: India]]'', Dr. Octopus is featured as a minion/meek doctor who is transformed by [[Green Goblin|Nalin Oberoi]] into a mystical version of Doc Ock. He is later killed by Oberoi, while trying to help Spider-Man rescue MJ and Aunt Meera from Oberoi.

===''Spider-Man: Reign''===
In the Alternate Universe as conceived by [[Kaare Andrews]], in which many Superheroes had grown old and retired, Octavius appeared to save Spider-Man from death at the hands of an older version of the [[Sinister Six]]. While he originally appeared to merely be world-weary, relying on his 'four sons' (his tentacles) to keep him alive, he revealed via monologue that he had in fact been dead for months, and had left the tentacles a program that would force them into action to find Spider-Man. Furthermore, the tentacles were used to play the tape on which his monologue is recorded, and take him to the graveyard where his loved ones lay. The hope is to use Spider-Man to reignite the age of the super powered beings, as both Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man were born from nuclear accidents.

===Ultimate Doctor Octopus===

[[Image:Panelultimateockdoc18.jpg|left|185px|thumb|Doctor Octopus as seen in the pages of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #18 (April 2002). Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', Doctor Octopus is no longer fat, but younger and very muscular. While the original Doctor Octopus wore sunglasses due to [[myopia]], the Ultimate Octavius wears them to disguise horrible wounds inflicted on his eyes during the accident that created him, that leave him very sensitive to light. His arms are also different: he modifies them so that their ends are made up of [[nanotechnology|nanobots]], and thus can have various lethal accessories, transforming the three-pronged 'claws' into flamethrowers, [[taser]]s, and machine guns. [[Ultimate Six]] revealed he had a psychic link with his arms and could control them remotely; #103 expanded on this, revealing Octavius also has the ability to manipulate metal. It has not yet been revealed how similar or dissimilar his power is to that of [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]].

Dr. Otto Octavius is introduced as a scientist at OsCorp and secretly a corporate spy for Norman Osborn's business rival, [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Justin Hammer|Justin Hammer]]. He is caught in a lab accident (the same one that turns Norman into the [[Green Goblin#Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]]), grafting his traditional metal arms onto his body. After this incident, he is able to communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Justin Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin Hammer perishes due to a heart attack caused by Doctor Octopus attacking him. Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Norman Osborn, form the [[Ultimate Six]], consisting of some of Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]] and an unwilling Spider-Man himself. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the White House lawn, Octopus is taken down by [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Wasp|Wasp]]. Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them. Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage, until he is once again stopped by Spider-Man. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Nick Fury melts Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwords to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the ''Ultimate Hobgoblin'' story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Norman Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen.

In the ''[[Clone saga#Ultimate Spider-Man Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]]'', Otto Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone of Peter believing itself to be [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Richard Parker|Richard Parker]], and a [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy]] clone that can transform into the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage creature]]. His experimentation and research was done for the [[FBI]]/[[CIA]] (both organizations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the [[U.S. Government]] wouldn't have to be reliant on Nick Fury's monopoly on the Ultimates. In #103, he smugly reveals he is now outside Fury's jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero's life. In issue #104 he creates a new set of arms out of metal scraps and battles both Spider-Man and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)#Ultimate Spider-Woman|Spider-Woman]], killing two other clones in the process, before being knocked out. 

Octavius makes a brief appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113 confronting Norman Osborn as the latter breaks out of the [[The Ultimates#Headquarters|Triskelion]]; Octavius attacks his former boss to prevent his escape, informing him that he betrayed him by giving the OZ formula to the FBI. Otto is beating Norman senseless until his other former ally, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Electro|Electro]], intervenes and shocks Ock with a bolt of electricity, knocking him out.

In his first episode "Doctor Octopus Armed and dangerous", Dr. Octopus used to be Otto Octavius, who was Peter Parker's science teacher at Science Camp. This relationship of former mentor and pupil made Dr Octopus fond of Peter even after his descent into villainy. One day, Octavius created a fusion experiment, using four metal tentacles. When the experiment exploded, Octavius' tentacles were permanently fused to his skeleton.

He is very timid and willing to apologize for every little thing, a direct contrast to his boss, Norman. He is one of OsCorp's most intelligent scientists and the creator of a four armed harness that makes him able to do dangerous experiments, playing a part in the creation of Sandman and Rhino, earning him the nickname "Doctor Octopus", which he considers demeaning. Eventually, as the result of a devastating accident, orchestrated by the Green Goblin, Octavius' harness becomes fused to his spinal cord. When found by Osborn and Spider-Man, the already paranoid doctor becomes deranged and megalomaniacal, blaming the two for his accident. He now has the nerve to attack both partieis, and takes "Doctor Octopus" as his new name. With his arms permanently fused, he then seeks to destroy all of those who have wronged him, but Spider-Man eventually defeated the menace at a Coney Island carnival. In the following days, Doc Ock sent letters to [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], who was going through therapy at [[Ravencroft]]. He convinced Electro to break him and the other members of the Sinister Six ([[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]) out of Ryker's Island to fight Spider-Man. Doc Ock showed an interest in Spider-Man's symbiote costume during the final battle at Central Park. Spider-Man's symbiote costume started to take control of Spider-Man and if it weren't for the intervention of Captain George Stacy, Doctor Octopus wouldn't have survived the battle. At the beginning of the second season, he is moved to Ravencroft where he is being treated by Dr. Kafka along with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Cletus Kasady]], and is apparently cured. He was offered a chance in the new Sinister Six, but Electro mentioned he isn't worth saving anymore, since he's no longer interested in villainy. At the end of the episode ''Reinforcement'', his tentacles break him out of Ravencroft, apparently by force. It's later revealed that he is the [[Master Planner]], and has been in preparation for a gang war between the criminal organizations of his, The Big Man's ([[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]), and Silvermane's. He is defeated by Spider-Man when a fight breaks out between the leaders.

* Director of the ''Spider-Man'' films, [[Sam Raimi]], has stated that Ock was intended to appear in [[Spider-Man (film)|the first film]], teaming up with [[Green Goblin]], but wasn't included because Raimi thought it "wouldn't do the movie justice to have a third origin in there."<ref>{{cite video | title = Making The Amazing | format = DVD | publisher = Sony |date = 2004}}</ref>

* Archive footage of Molina as Dr. Octopus appears in the opening scene of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and an old newspaper headline in J. Jonah Jameson's office states that Octopus is still at large.

===Video games===
Doctor Octopus appears in many Spider-Man [[computer games]] and [[video game]]s, some of which feature him as the game's primary [[Antagonist (literature)‎|antagonist]]:

*Doctor Octopus appears in the Spider-Man ''[[Questprobe]]'' game.
*Doctor Octopus was one of many Spider-Man villains to appear in the [[arcade game]] ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]''.
*Doc Ock is one of the [[boss (video games)|bosses]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (Game Boy)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' for the [[Game Boy]].
*Doctor Octopus is the final boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]''.
*Dr. Octopus is the first boss in the game ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]''.
*Doctor Octopus the first boss in both the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] and [[Sega Genesis]] games based on the animated series.
*Doctor Octopus appears as a boss in the Japanese only [[Super Famicon]] game ''[[Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]''.
*Efrem Zimbalist Jr. reprises his role of Doctor Octopus in the ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game for the [[PlayStation]], [[Dreamcast]], [[personal computer|PC]], [[Nintendo 64]], and [[Game Boy Color]]. Doctor Octopus works with [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] to turn everyone in New York into symbiotes but they are both defeated by [[Spider-Man]]. After being defeated, the Carnage symbiote bonds with Ock, turning him into Monster Ock (voiced by [[Marcus Shirock]]).
*Doctor Octopus appeared as the final boss in the [[Game Boy Color]] game ''[[Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six]]''.
*Doctor Octopus appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' game based on the movie ''Spider-Man 2'' voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]. He was the final boss in the game, in addition to being in other boss fights. He also is seen in the boss arena along with [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Shocker]], and [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], respectively, replacing [[Mysterio]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In the PC/Mac version of the ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' game, the prologue cutscene takes most of the cutscene from the main console version where Dr. Octavius' machine goes haywire and [[Spider-Man]] swings in to stop it. Taking from that, Doc Ock is responsible for nearly all of the game's events. It is possible that he was responsible for having several crooks cause a major riot at the New York Maximum Security Prison and free the supervillain known as the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], which was successful, though the Rhino failed to kill Spider-Man when he escaped. After the Rhino was defeated when he accidentally blew up a gas station and was sent several blocks away from the explosion, knocked unconscious, we see Ock's arms spiriting Rhino away. In the next level, Doc Ock pulls a heist on the bank, like he did in the movie and the main console version, and after Spider-Man defeats several of Ock's crooks and saves several security guards and civilians, he confronts Ock in the bank's basement. There, Ock is stealing much gold and money in a vault and after Spider-Man solves a puzzle that opens the large triple door that is separating them, they battle. Ock escapes, and Spider-Man is forced to let him go to save his [[Aunt May]] from three crooks whom have decided to kidnap her and place her in their van. Later, after Spider-Man defeats the supervillain [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] at a construction site, Puma reveals to Spider-Man he was merely a distraction for Spider-Man while Ock kidnapped his girlfriend, [[Mary Jane Watson]], which Ock did. Later, Ock was responsible for the hold-up at OsCorp with his thugs, the Rhino and the eight bombs Ock planted in the building. Spider-Man took care of all those, but Ock counted on [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]] to distract the vigilante with an illusion of New York literally torn up out of the ground. Mysterio failed, and Spider-Man lived. Later, Spider-Man fought through several of Ock's cronies at the subway station, and confronted him on top of a moving train where Ock constantly threw things at Spider-Man and dismantling the carts of the train. That is until it crashed, and both superhumans survived. Spider-Man tracked Doc Ock down in his compound, fighting through more thugs, destroying gun turrets Ock placed around and inside the compound, until Spider-Man finally found Mary Jane and Ock activated his machine. There, Ock confronted Spider-Man on a platform on top of a machine, throwing explosive barrels at Spider-Man, and the vigilante defeated him by shooting at four generators that caused explosions that temporarily stunned Ock and let Spider-Man pummel him several times. Once Spider-Man finally defeats Ock, he realizes the error of his ways like he did in the movie, and sacrifices himself by pulling his machine down into the river as Spider-Man saves Mary Jane.
*Doctor Octopus is a playable character in the ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'' video game voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]. He, alongside Green Goblin, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] are shown in the opening cutscene fighting Spider-Man and New Goblin until they are attacked by P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s and the villains end up abducted. Spider-Man encounters him in a secret lab within a Japanese industrial factory building another solar generator. Spider-Man defeats Doctor Octopus and frees him from the Control Amulet. After being freed, Doctor Octopus joins Spider-Man on his quest.

===Toys and collectibles===
*Doc Ock has been recreated in [[action figure]] form multiple times, first as part of [[Mattel]]'s [[Secret Wars]] line, then later many times by [[Toy Biz]] in their Spider-Man and [[Marvel Legends]] series, and finally by [[Hasbro]] as apart of their [[Spider-Man: Origin]] series. The movie figure will also be featured in Hasbro's Marvel Legends Spider-Man 3 wave. The action feature from this figure was removed. Hasbro released a Spectacular Spider-Man action figure later.
