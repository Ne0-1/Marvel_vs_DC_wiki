'''Doctor Octopus''' ('''Dr. Otto Gunther Octavius''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]] since 1963. A highly intelligent [[mad scientist]], Doctor Octopus is one of [[Spider-Man]]'s greatest foes.  He is typically portrayed as a stocky, [[myopic]] man who utilizes four powerful, mechanical appendages, and is obsessed with proving his own genius and destroying Spider-Man. In his first several appearances, Dr. Octopus' last name was spelled "Octavious."  All stories since have spelled it "Octavius". Spider-Man has also nicknamed Octopus as '''Doc Ock'''. The character has appeared in numerous Spider-Man cartoons and video games and is portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]] in the [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' as the film's main antagonist. In 2009, Doctor Octopus was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 28th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/28.html Doctor Octopus is number 28 ], [[IGN]].</ref> Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: "Created by [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Doc Ock, as he became known, has become one of the web slinger's most persistent and dangerous foes."<ref>[[Mike Conroy (writer)|Conroy, Mike]]. 500 Comicbook Villains, p.44-45, Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
The character of Doctor Octopus first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #3 ([[1963 in comics#July|July 1963]]), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].  The character soon appeared in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #11 and #12, and again in #31 - 33.

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York]], Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father, Torbert, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother Mary. Young Otto's shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a "teacher's pet" and targeted as a subject for [[bullying]]. Torbert Octavius did not appreciate having a bullied son, and roared at Otto to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would defend her son from Torbert's [[tirade]]s, saying Otto was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother's insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in manual labor, Otto was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Otto's devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a [[university]] [[scholarship]]. During Otto's freshman year of college, his father's death due to an industrial accident pushed Otto towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science. After graduating from college, Otto Octavius found work in an engineering firm.

Otto became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], atomic research consultant, [[inventor]], and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced [[waldos|mechanical arms]] controlled via a [[brain–computer interface]] to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacle arms were resistant to [[radiation]] and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body.{{issue|date=August 2012}} Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from [[The Vitruvian Man]], the famous pencil sketch by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], one of his idols.<ref>''Spider-Man/Dr. Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #1</ref>

Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, a fellow researcher named Mary Alice Anders befriended him when Otto impressed her with a demonstration of his harness, and the two began a courtship. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, Otto's mother did not approve, believing that no woman was good enough for her son. To please her, he ended his engagement. Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius' disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' vol. 1 #3</ref> His co-workers often called him "Dr. Octopus" behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #3</ref>

===Criminal career begins===

During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius' body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs<ref name="untoldtales">{{Cite book|last = DeCandido|first = Keith R.A.|authorlink = Keith R.A. DeCandido|editor = Stan Lee and Kurt Busiek|title = Untold Tales of Spider-Man|year = 1997|publisher = Berkley Trade; Boulevard edition|chapter = Arms and the Man|isbn = 1-57297-294-7|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself Dr. Octopus, the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/> Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is [[myopia|near-sighted]], with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very sensitive to light, requiring him to wear glasses with shaded lenses.<ref>''Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure'' #3</ref>  

In their first encounter, Octopus defeated Spider-Man, tossing him out of a window. Following this defeat, Spider-Man considered giving up his heroic career, but was inspired to continue his heroic career by the [[Human Torch]], and ultimately defeated Doctor Octopus.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #3"/>

Over the years, Dr. Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man's rogues gallery]]. Doctor Octopus formed the original [[Sinister Six]] to fight Spider-Man after taking [[Betty Brant]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]] hostage.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups, and usually takes offense when someone else leads the team. Disguised as the Master Planner, he organized a theft of atomic equipment. After he stole a formula that Spider-Man needed to cure his Aunt May, Spider-Man tracked Octopus' gang to their base. In the ensuing fight, Spider-Man became trapped underneath a collapsed building. Seemingly doomed, Spider-Man was ultimately able to draw upon sheer force of will to summon the strength to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31-32</ref> It is later revealed he used a scuba tank to escape.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Doctor Octopus later attempts to steal the Defense Department's Nullifier device, and sets a trap for Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #53</ref> He became [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s tenant,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #54</ref> then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider-Man; although he had hoped that it would merely nullify Spider-Man's web-shooters, the radiation in Spider-Man's blood resulted in the Nullifier's interaction with Spider-Man's unique biology rendering him amnesiac,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #55</ref> Doctor Octopus subsequently tricking Spider-Man into helping him before Spider-Man's own better nature resulted in him turning against his 'partner' despite his memory loss long enough for [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] to use the Nullifier to shut down his tentacles.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #56</ref>

Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely, and used them to free himself from prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #88</ref> His resulting battle with Spider-Man resulted in the death of Captain [[George Stacy]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #89-90</ref> Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #112-115</ref> He attempted to wed May Parker in order to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently unknowingly inherited.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #130-131</ref> Doc Ock escaped death when the island was destroyed, and began a life as a homeless person.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man''#152, 154, 156</ref> He next battled the "ghost" of Hammerhead, and was able to return him to human form and defeat him after a temporary alliance with Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #157-159</ref>

Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> He also attempted to poison New York City with printers' ink, and battled the [[Punisher]] and Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #15</ref> He next battled the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and his gang.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #73, 75, 76</ref> He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #124</ref> He later displayed symptoms which [[Mister Fantastic]] diagnosed as [[multiple personality disorder]].<ref name="Fantastic Four #267">''Fantastic Four'' #267</ref>  Doctor Octopus was taken to the [[Beyonder]]'s Battleworld, where he fought a horde of heroes and plotted against [[Doctor Doom]] for leadership of the group of villains.  He was able to defeat the [[X-Men]] until [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] came to the mutants' aid.<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1-12</ref>

===Arachnophobia===
His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of Spider-Man's then-partner, the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], which led to Spider-Man beating Doc Ock to within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, and he needed to be treated for his acute [[arachnophobia]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #4-5</ref> Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save [[New York City]] from an exploding [[nuclear reactor]]; Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider-Man indirectly, but after his out-of-control arms beat Spider-Man seemingly senseless, Spider-Man convinced him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his 'great triumph'. Octavius decided to let Spider-Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #297</ref>

===Death and resurrection===
During the [[Clone Saga]], Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death from a poison injected by [[Vulture (comics)|the Vulture]], although this was only because he desired to be the one to kill Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #220</ref> During the healing process he discovered the identity of Spider-Man and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover [[Stunner (comics)|Stunner]]. However, Stunner was knocked out and Doc Ock was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named [[Kaine]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #221</ref> Octavius' student [[Lady Octopus|Carolyn Trainer]] took over as "Doctor Octopus" until the original was resurrected by a branch of the mystical [[ninja]] cult known as the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #427</ref> Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he had no knowledge of Spider-Man's identity. The reason was that the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer; that recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #428</ref>

===Subsequent schemes===
In later years, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed "[[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Spider-Woman]]", and was involved in a plot involving using [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] limbs as mind-control devices, to create an army of minions. He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of an arrogant young businessman and con artist named [[Luke Carlyle|Carlyle]], who pretended to employ Octavius at his company.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #43</ref> This proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius' harness.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #44</ref> During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doc Ock ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle's suit with webbing, although Doc Ock informed his enemy that he only did this to hurt Carlyle rather than to help Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #45</ref>

Then, Dr. Octopus took the ambassador of the newly-formed Free Palestinian State hostage, demanding that in exchange for the ambassador's freedom, Spider-Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world. When Spider-Man went to Times Square, he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask, angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

Dr. Octopus was taken to [[Ryker's Island]] and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the [[Green Goblin]]. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

===Civil War===
Octavius unsuccessfully tried to form and lead another version of the [[Sinister Six]], because [[Captain America]]'s [[Civil War (comics)|Secret Avengers]] managed to defeat the villainous group, although Ock himself eluded authorities.{{issue|date=December 2010}} In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #28, Dr. Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Ock then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in one of their first encounters (at the time, Peter was severely weakened by a bad case of flu and Octavius assumed he was an impostor). He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Dr. Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius.{{issue|date=December 2010}} He is then sent to [[Baron Zemo]]'s supervillain detention facility (as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #104 and ''[[Iron Man]]'' Vol IV #14). [[Spider-Man: One More Day|Later]], Spider-Man contacts Octavius to see if he can help with Aunt May's condition.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24</ref>

===Dying===
In the post-Brand New Day continuity Doctor Octopus' story is largely unchanged, albeit he's now dying, suffering from the consequences of the punishment his body took in his whole villainous career. As such, he becomes increasily despondent and brazen in his plans against Spider-Man, enhancing his failing body with technology and trying to exert control over New York City by using his newly minted Octobots. He also targets aggressively Aunt May (guilty of being due to marry another man) and the allies of Spider-Man, vowing revenge when stopped.<ref name="ASM600">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600</ref>

In his desperate attempts to prolong his life, Octavius reforms the Sinister Six, wishing to acquire [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s unborn son, becoming able to syntetize a pure strain of the Goblin Serum,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> only to be thwarted again by the efforts of Spider-Man and the guilty conscience of the Lizard.,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646</ref> reigniting his bitterness towards his foe, but gaining a grudging aknowledgment of his abilities.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref> Octavius and Spider-Man cross keep crossing their ways during the following months, with the Avengers fighting a new iteration of the Sinister Six,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #648"/> Doctor Octopus sending a remote Octobot in John Jameson's shuttle,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #653</ref> and Octavius contacting Tony Stark to force him find a cure for his degenerative condition. However, when Tony Stark genuinely offers him to have the brightest minds in the Marvel Universe finding a viable cure, Octavius smugly refuses, basking in the knowledge of his superior intellect.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #502</ref>

His attempts to prolong his life however doesn't hinder a more vast, sinister plan, in which he has the Sinister Six fighting the [[Avengers Academy]] for a piece of Pym's technology,<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14</ref> the [[Future Fondation]] for a piece of Reed's tech <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #660</ref> and the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] for the ''Zero Cannon'', a powerful antigravity weapon.,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676</ref> later revealing to have gained something useful from his early foray in John Jameson's shuttle.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #681</ref> All this careful preparation came to fruition during the "[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]" storyline,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/121/1214698p1.html|title=IGN.com: Dan Slott discusses the next big Amazing Spider-Man storyline|date=13 December 2011}}</ref> where the apparently mismatched piece of technology stolen are used to build a satellite net, the ''Octavian Lens'', able to alter the world's climate by enhancing or smothering solar rays. 

Doctor Octopus at first claims to have a benevolent intent, wishing to halt the [[greenhouse effect]] in exchange from gratitude and recognition,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682</ref> but he's soon exposed by Spider-Man (enhanced himself with new Horizon Labs-built tech<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683</ref>), [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Silver Sable]], and his real plan (immolate a great part of entire population to prevent anyone from surviving his incumbing death, having the survivors remember him in perpetual fear and awe) is exposed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685</ref> Playing over his ego, Spider-Man manages to stall him, by reminding that, even if he managed to have anyone surviving a drastic heating of the entire Earth, the survivors would likely be brain-damaged, and such unable to remember his actions.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687</ref> He then roughly defeats him, in retailation for Silver Sable's death, openly mocking and berating his efforts by claiming that, because of the Octavian Lens' destruction and his declining health, he's now going to die alone, forgotten and without a legacy.<ref>''The Avenging Spider-Man'' #8</ref>

==="Death" and Rebirth===
However, even his captivity and incarceration prove to be minor setbacks in Octavius' villainy. Since Peter Parker, in the previous months, was forced to access the Octobots' hive mind several times,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #683"/><ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man #672''</ref> he unwillingly gave Octavius a full, unrestricted access to his mind, and as such he becomes able to program a lone Octobot to swap their mind pattern. While Peter Parker is now trapped in the failing body of Otto Octavius, Octavius is now in Peter's body, able to access the memories of his foe but with none of his restraints, just content of living his civilian life and planning for his future.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #698">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #698</ref>
 
Peter Parker, now as desperate as Octavius was, assembles a new, latest iteration of the Sinister Six, with [[Trapster]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and [[Hydro-Man]] (turning down Alistair Smythe, Morbius, the Living Vampire, and Lizard), giving them the task of keeping him alive and capturing "Spider-Man", thus becoming able to reverse the mind swap. However, while Trapster is able to build a portable life support for "Octavius", he bluntly states he can give him only 700 minutes to live.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699</ref> As such, "Octavius" openly antagonizes "Spider-Man". Octavius accepts the last challenge and while Peter Parker's attempt to reclaim his body fails, he's able to (before dying in the crippled body of Octavius)  imbue his foe with his very memories and values. A distraught Otto Octavius (in a sudden surge of empathy for his sworn nemesis) vows to steer himself away from villainy and accepts Peter's dying wish of having a Spider-Man protect New York. Otto Octavius claims that since he now holds the physical might and the good values embodied by Peter Parker, but also the boundless ambition and the scientific mindframe of Doctor Octopus, he will surpass the "Amazing Spider-Man" becoming a "[[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]]".<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700</ref> Within Peter Parker's body, Doctor Octopus as the Superior Spider-Man starts his new career as a hero by redesigning his gear and putting his past as a bumbling villainous buffoon behind himself.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' 15.1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Octavius is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], and he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]] in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] to offer his expertise when the [[Invisible Woman]] suffered from complications during her second pregnancy as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers.<ref name="Fantastic Four #267"/>

Due to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, [[prehensility|prehensile]], titanium-steel artificial tentacle "arms" (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages is enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like Spider-Man, or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant, as he has managed to force to fight on the defensive, opponents as dangerous as Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and [[Captain America]].<ref>[http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/7/18514151252-orig.jpg Spectacular Spider-Man #221]</ref>

Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.{{issue|date=November 2010}}

Doctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to a crippling illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to ''take'' damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of "Octobots" (small [[octopus]]-like drones).<ref name="ASM600"/>

===Harnesses===
Dr. Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium]] harness, and a carbonanium harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' miniseries.

His current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense but light weight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death.<ref>''Daredevil'' #165</ref>

The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting [[Iron Man]] in combat possible, tearing the hero's armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #22</ref> The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.

Eventually, Dr. Octopus' harness was surgically removed, but he was still able to control it mentally, even at a distance. This power was initially explained as having been caused by the initial accident; Octopus and his arms were fused together mentally as well as physically. In fact, when the original harness was destroyed, it caused Octavius excruciating pain. He was seen sweating profusely and screaming.{{issue|date=August 2012}} Later stories suggest that Octavius possessed minor telepathic powers that gave him a direct mental link with his harness. These telepathic powers were also hinted at to have caused a brain [[aneurysm]] in his father when they first developed during puberty.{{issue|date=August 2012}} However, the original controls for the harness remain on the first version, with Mister Fantastic managing to use these controls to shut down the tentacles when he needed Octavius's help, though it is obviously impractical to use this regularly, given Reed Richards's unique powers.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

===Powers as the Superior Spider-Man===

However, as a way to reaffirm his perceived superior mind, Octavius tinkered with the original Spider-Man costume, adding some [[carbonadium]] plating over his neck and skull,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #700"/> talons on his hands and feet, split-toed footwear fashioned as [[tabi|jika-tabi]] shoes, a slightly different, more imposing spider-motif on his back and enhanced lenses in his costume, with HUD and tracking abilities.<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man 15.1">''Avenging Spider-Man 15.1''</ref>

He also retains access to some of his former hideouts as the Doctor Octopus, coupling Horizon Tech-derived inventions with his own peculiar brand of technology.<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man 15.1"/>

In the prequel series to ''Marvel Zombies'', ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' and ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'', the zombie Doctor Octopus makes only a few [[cameo appearance]]s, as a member of the undead Sinister Six. He returns in ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'' along with a version of the Sinister Six. He was ripped in half and infected by the undead Spider-Man.

In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] alternate [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|continuity]], it is revealed that Doctor Octopus attacked the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' shortly after the disappearance/retirement of Spider-Man, killing editor-in-chief [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]]. This motivates ''Bugle'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to initiate "Project: Human Fly", an attempt to create a government controlled superhero. Mercenaries (later revealed to be in the employ of Doctor Octopus) attempt to steal the Human Fly suit, but are thwarted when Jameson's grandson takes the suit (the controls of which bond to the first user) and becomes the superhero [[Buzz (comics)|The Buzz]]. The Buzz and [[Spider-Girl]] eventually apprehend Doctor Octopus, who—now being struck with cancer—falls into a coma from which he is not expected to recover.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Later, the mantle of Doctor Octopus is taken up by [[Lady Octopus]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Here, he is a doctor working in a facility on [[Ellis Island]].  His legs are crippled and withered, and he travels in a wheelchair with six long metal claw-like tentacles sticking out.  He is officially conducting experiments on primates, to study their brains in connection with evolution, and in the end, it is shown he is secretly taking in kidnapped African-Americans for his own more secret experiments.  He is later revealed to in fact be working with the Nazis and their American proxies, "[[Friends of New Germany]]", with the plot of making all minorities into mindless slaves. However, his experiments are uncovered by Spider-Man, and although he is allowed to leave the country due to his past service to America, he is subsequently rejected by the Nazis as they believe his crippled body reflects a crippled mind that could produce nothing of value for them.<ref>''Spider-Man Noir: Eyes Without a Mask'' #1-4</ref>

===''Spider-Man: India''===
In ''[[Spider-Man: India]]'', Dr. Octopus is featured as a minion/meek doctor who is transformed by [[Green Goblin|Nalin Oberoi]] into a mystical version of Doctor Octopus to find and kill Pavitr Prabhaker, the Indian version of Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man: India'' #2</ref> He is later killed by Oberoi, while trying to help Spider-Man rescue MJ and Aunt Meera from Oberoi.<ref>''Spider-Man: India'' #4</ref>

===''Spider-Man: Reign''===

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Panelultimateockdoc18.jpg|left|185px|thumb|Doctor Octopus as seen in the pages of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #18 (April 2002). Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', Doctor Octopus is younger and very muscular. While the original Doctor Octopus wore sunglasses due to [[myopia]], the Ultimate Octavius wears them to disguise horrible wounds inflicted on his eyes during the accident that created him, that leave him very sensitive to light. His arms are also different: he modifies them so that their ends are made up of [[nanotechnology|nanobots]], and thus can have various lethal accessories, transforming the three-pronged 'claws' into flamethrowers, [[taser]]s, and machine guns. ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' revealed he had a psychic link with his arms and could control them remotely.{{issue|date=November 2012}} ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103 expanded on this, revealing Octavius also has the ability to manipulate metal.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #103</ref>

Dr. Otto Octavius is introduced as a scientist at OsCorp and secretly a corporate spy for Norman Osborn's business rival, [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Justin Hammer|Justin Hammer]]. He is caught in a lab accident (the same one that turns Norman into the [[Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]]), grafting his traditional metal arms onto his body. After this incident, he is able to communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Justin Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin Hammer perishes due to a heart attack caused by Doctor Octopus attacking him. Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Norman Osborn, form the [[Ultimate Six]], consisting of some of Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]]. There are only five villains to begin with, but Norman Osborn planned to bring Spider-Man into the group. The five attack S.H.I.E.L.D. and capture an unmasked Spider-Man. They tie him to a chair, and Osborn humiliates Peter by rcounting the accident that created him, and he and Otto's involvements. Osborn then blackmails Peter into joining them, threataning Mary Jane's life. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the White House lawn, Octopus is taken down by [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Wasp|Wasp]]. Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them. Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage. He manages to capture Spider-Man, and he brings him aboard an airplane, ties him to a chair, and unmasks him. From there, he inflicts humiliation and torture on to Peter, mocking him as a teenager, pulling a tooth out, and webbing his mouth. Peter escaped, and defeats Octavius. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] melts Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterwords to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the ''Ultimate Hobgoblin'' story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Norman Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen.

In the "[[Clone Saga#Ultimate Spider-Man Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]]", Otto Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone of Peter believing itself to be [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], and a [[Ultimate Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy]] clone that can transform into the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage creature]]. His experimentation and research was done for the [[FBI]]/[[CIA]] (both organizations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the [[U.S. Government]] wouldn't have to be reliant on Nick Fury's monopoly on the Ultimates. In #103, he smugly reveals he is now outside Fury's jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero's life. In issue #104 he creates a new set of arms out of metal scraps and battles both Spider-Man and [[Ultimate Spider-Woman|Spider-Woman]], killing two other clones in the process, before being knocked out.

Octavius makes a brief appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113 confronting Norman Osborn as the latter breaks out of the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]; Octavius attacks his former boss to prevent his escape, informing him that he betrayed him by giving the OZ formula to the FBI. Otto is beating Norman senseless until his other former ally, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Electro|Electro]], intervenes and shocks Ock with a bolt of electricity, knocking him out.

During the ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'', Doctor Octopus appears as a member of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s Brain Trust.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #3</ref>

Alongside the rest of the Ultimate Six, Octopus plays a role in the "Death of Spider-Man" storyline. Norman Osborn breaks him and the rest out of the Triskelion. After their escape, Norman Osborn informs them that God wishes for them to kill Peter Parker.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #156</ref> Doctor Octopus wanted to leave the group, because he wanted to live a normal life as a scientist and also said that he took enough pride in helping created Spider-Man. Osborn was outraged by the fact that Octavius tried to share credit for Spider-Man's existence, and attacked him. The two of them fought which ended with Osborn pummeling him to death.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #157</ref>

This version of Doctor Octopus is ranked as 179th greatest comic book character of [[Wizard Entertainment|Wizard]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
