'''[[Doctor of Philosophy|Dr.]] Otto Octavius''', better known as '''Doctor Octopus''' or '''Doc Ock''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], an archenemy of [[Spider-Man]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #3 ([[1963#July|July 1963]]). Stan Lee has cited that Doctor Octopus is one of his favorite Spider-Man villains. In his first several appearances, Dr. Octopus' last name was spelled "'''Octavious.'''"  All stories since have spelled it Octavius.

Despite his name, he is not an [[octopus]], but rather a [[human being]].  Octavius is a stocky, [[myopic]] man who utilizes four powerful, mechanical appendages. A highly intelligent [[mad scientist]], he is obsessed with proving his own genius and destroying Spider-Man. Doc Ock is considered by many to be Spider-Man's [[Archenemy|greatest adversary]] (rivaled only by the [[Green Goblin]]).

Doctor Octopus, like the Green Goblin, is one of Spider-Man's greatest and most enduring enemies. He has been featured in most Spider-Man [[animation|animated series]] and [[video games]] and was played by [[Alfred Molina]] in the 2004 movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]],'' as well as by [[Peter MacNicol]] in the new ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' which will premiere on [[The CW]] next year.

== Fictional character biography ==
Born in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York]], Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother, leading Otto to be shy and reclusive in school. However, at his mother's insistence, he was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. His father's death due to an industrial accident pushed him further towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science.

Otto became a brilliant and respected [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], [[inventor]], and [[lecturer]]. He designed a set of highly advanced mechanical arms to assist him with his research into [[atomic physics]]. The tentacled arms were resistant to [[radiation]] and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body. 

Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, a fellow researcher named Mary Alice Anders befriended him, and later agreed to marry him. His mother did not approve, and to please her, he ended his engagement.  Later, when he discovered that his mother had begun dating a librarian, he rebuked her causing her to have a fatal heart attack in the heat of their argument.

During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius' body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs{{Fact|date=February 2007}}), and the scientist turned to a life of crime.

Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is [[myopia|near-sighted]], with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man: in his first appearance he beat Spider-Man so badly that the wall-crawler considered giving up his heroic career, until he was inspired to continue by the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] at the time when the [[Fantastic Four]] were called in to fight Doctor Octopus.

Over the years Dr. Octopus has become one of, if not the, most identifiable member of Spider-Man's rogues' gallery. He remains one of Spider-Man's most dangerous foes, having many legendary battles with him over the years. His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of Spider-Man's then-partner, the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], who was placed in critical condition and led to Spider-Man beating "Doc Ock" to within an inch of his life.

The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, until Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow his nemesis to break free of his fears and recruit him to save [[New York City]] from an exploding [[nuclear reactor]].

Doctor Octopus has worked with other supervillains on several occasions, most notably as the leader of the original incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]]. He has been a member of other versions of the Sinister Six, and founded his own short-lived version of the [[Masters of Evil]] when his teammates from the Sinister Six proved too difficult to manipulate.

Despite the obvious obstacles, Octavius was for a time on good terms with Peter Parker's [[Aunt May]], whom he first met in ''The Amazing Spider-Man [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #1 (1964) when he abducted her and Peter's then-girlfriend [[Betty Brant]] to attract Spider-Man's attention. In fact, in later years May Parker and Otto Octavius were briefly engaged to be married. Their wedding was interrupted by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].

During the [[Clone Saga]], Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death due to a poison injected by [[Vulture (comics)|the Vulture]]. During the healing process he discovered the identity of Spider-Man and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover [[Stunner (comics)|Stunner]]. But Stunner was knocked out and Doc Ock was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named [[Kaine]]. Octavius' student [[Lady Octopus|Carolyn Trainer]] took over as "Doctor Octopus" until the original was resurrected by a branch of the mystical [[ninja]] cult known as [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]]. Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he had no knowledge of Spider-Man's identity. The reason was that the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer with his recorded memories; that recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death.

In recent years, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed "[[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Spider-Woman]]", and was involved in a plot involving using [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] limbs as mind-control devices, to create an army of minions. He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of an arrogant young  businessman and con artist named [[Carlyle (Marvel Comics)|Carlyle]], who pretended to employ Octavius at his company. This, however, proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius' harness. During a battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doc Ock ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle's suit with webbing.

Dr. Octopus was taken into Ryker's Island and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the Green Goblin. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event.

He broke out of jail but was returned there after being defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Invincible (comics)|Invincible]].

Octavius unsuccessfully tries to form and lead another version of the [[Sinister Six]], because [[Captain America]]'s [[Civil War (comic book)|Secret Avengers]] managed to defeat the villainous group, although Ock himself eludes authorities. In ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #28, Dr. Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Ock then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in one of their first encounters (at the time, Peter was severely weakened and Octavius assumed it was an impostor). He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Dr. Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius. He is then sent to [[Baron Zemo]]'s super-villain detention facility (as seen in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #104 and ''[[Iron Man]]'' Vol IV #14). He is one of the ex-super villains trying to hunt down the renegade super heroes.

In "One More Day" Part 2, Octavius is one of the people Spider-man contacted to see if he could help with Aunt May's condition, although no speech is given in each panels, he most likely did not have a clue like the others of what to do.

==Strengths and abilities==
Doctor Octopus has been hinted at being a low-level technopathic mutant{{Fact|date=February 2007}} being able to control his arms when they are not even connected to him, but no superpowers have been outrightly revealed. 

He is a genius in the field of [[atomic physics]], in which he holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy#United States|Ph. D.]]

His harness is attached to four mentally controlled, [[Prehensility|prehensile]] metallic appendages. These arms are capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages is enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like Spider-Man, or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine.

===Harnesses===
Dr. Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original [[titanium]] harness, a more powerful [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] harness, and the current harness, which was modified in 2004 to somewhat resemble the version seen in the movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif.  The original and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' miniseries.

While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move quickly about. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the Hulk into submission. The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily.

During the 1960s (now probably the early 1990s, due to [[Retcon|retroactive continuity]]), Dr. Octopus' original harness was surgically removed, but he was still able to control it mentally, even at a distance. This power was initially explained as having been caused by the initial accident; Octopus and his arms were fused together mentally, as well as physically. In fact when the original harness was destroyed it caused Octavius excruciating pain.  He was seen sweating profusely and screaming.  Later stories suggest that Octavius possessed minor telepathic powers that gave him a direct mental link with his harness, a link he has duplicated with their successors.

==Other versions==
=== House of M ===

In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality created by the [[Scarlet Witch]], Otto Octavius makes an appearance as a researcher for the government, studying stem cells.

=== Marvel Zombies ===

On Earth-2149 (a world in which almost all heroes and villains are zombies) an undead Doctor Octopus first appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' series alongside several other zombie supervillains attempting to kill and devour the invading [[Galactus]]; this incarnation of Doctor Octopus is apparently destroyed by several cosmically powered hero zombies after he got in the way of an attack they were aiming at Galactus. <ref> {{Cite comic

In the prequel series to ''Marvel Zombies'', ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' and ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'', the zombie Doctor Octopus makes few [[cameo appearance]]s, as a member of the undead Sinister Six.

===[[MC2]]===
In the [[MC2]] alternate [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|continuity]], it is revealed that Doctor Octopus attacked the [[Daily Bugle]] shortly after the disappearance/retirement of Spider-Man, killing editor-in-chief [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]]. This motivates Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson to initiate "Project: Human Fly", an attempt to create a government controlled superhero. Mercenaries (later revealed to be in the employ of Doctor Octopus) attempt to steal the Human Fly suit, but are thwarted when Jameson's grandson takes the suit (the controls of which bond to the first user) and becomes the superhero [[The Buzz (comics)|The Buzz]]. The Buzz and [[Spider-Girl]] eventually apprehend Doctor Octopus, who--now being struck with cancer--falls into a coma from which he is not expected to recover.

Later, the mantle of Doctor Octopus is taken up by [[Lady Octopus]].

===''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]''===
In the Alternate Universe as conceived by [[Kaare Andrews]], in which many Superheroes had grown old and retired, Octavius appeared to save Spider-Man from death at the hands of an older version of the [[Sinister Six]]. While he originally appeared to merely be world-weary, relying on his 'four sons' (his tentacles) to keep him alive, he revealed via monologue that he had in fact been dead for months, and had left the tentacles a program that would force them into action to find Spider-Man, play him the tape on which his monologue is recorded, and take him to the graveyard where his loved ones lay, hoping to use Spider-Man to reignite the age of the super powered beings, as both Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man were born from nuclear accidents.

===Ultimate Doctor Octopus===<!-- This section is linked from [[Green Goblin]] -->
[[Image:Ultimatedoctoroctopus.JPG|225px|thumb|Ultimate Doctor Octopus.]]
Visually, Ultimate Doc Ock is no longer fat and middle aged, but young and very muscular. While the original Doctor Octopus wore sunglasses due to myopia, the Ultimate Octavius wears them to disguise horrible wounds inflicted on his eyes during the accident that created him, that leave him very sensitive to light.

His arms are also different: he modifies them so that their ends are made up of [[nanotechnology|nanobots]], and thus can have various lethal accessories, transforming the three-pronged 'claws' into flamethrowers, [[taser]]s, and machine guns. [[Ultimate Six]] revealed he had a psychic link with his arms and could control them remotely; #103 expanded on this, revealing Octavius actually did not have a psychic link with his arms only, rather that he has the ability to manipulate metal. It has not yet been revealed how similar or dissimilar his power is to that of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].

In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', Dr. Otto Octavius is introduced as a lab assistant to Norman Osborn and secretly a spy for Osborn's business rival, Justin Hammer. He is caught in a lab accident (the same one that turns Norman into the [[Green Goblin]]), grafting his traditional metal arms onto his body. After this incident, he is able to communicate with these mechanical arms via telepathy. He modifies his arms to have the power to morph into different shapes, and then seeks revenge against Justin Hammer, but Spider-Man intervenes. Although Octavius is defeated by Spider-Man, Justin Hammer perishes due to a heart attack caused by Doctor Octopus attacking him.

Afterwards, Octavius is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he, along with Norman Osborn, form the [[Ultimate Six]], comprised of some of Spider-Man's [[rogues gallery]] and an unwilling Spider-Man himself. In a battle between the Six and the Ultimates on the White House lawn, Octopus is taken down by [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. Octavius is separated from his tentacles and held in a different prison far away from them.

Octavius later finds out that his ex-wife is giving the rights to use his likeness in the Spider-Man film. Outraged, he summons his tentacles from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and goes on a rampage, until he is once again stopped by Spider-Man. Back in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Nick Fury melts Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms in front of him and instructs the guards to watch the melting mechanism for at least an hour afterward to make sure the arms would not try to escape. However, in the "Ultimate Hobgoblin" story arc, it was revealed that a spare set of arms existed within a bunker belonging to Norman Osborn. Plans for these remain to be seen.

In the [[Clone Saga#Ultimate Clone Saga|Ultimate Clone Saga]], Otto Octavius was revealed to be responsible for all the Spider-Man clones, including an older clone of Peter believing itself to be [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]], and a [[Gwen Stacy]] clone that can transform into the [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Carnage|Carnage creature]]. His experimentation and research was done for the FBI/CIA (both organisations are said to be behind it in different issues) in order to find a way to create super soldiers so the U.S. Government wouldn't have to be reliant on Nick Fury's monopoly on the Ultimates. In #103, he smugly reveals he is now outside Fury's jurisdiction and takes pleasure in pointing out to Peter that his work perverts the hero's life. In issue #104 he creates a new set of arms out of metal scraps and battles both Spider-Man and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)#Ultimate Spider-Woman|Ultimate Spider-Woman]], killing two other clones in the process, before being knocked out. 

Octavius makes a brief appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #113 confronting Norman Osborn as the latter breaks out of the Triskelion; Octavius attacks his former boss to prevent his escape, informing him that he betrayed him by giving the OZ formula to the FBI. Ock is beating Norman senseless until his other former ally, [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], intervenes and shocks Ock with a bolt of electricity, knocking him out.

==In other media==
===Television===
==== Spider-Man (1967) ====

Doctor Octopus' first appearance outside of comics was in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' [[animated series]], where he appeared in two [[episode]]s, "The Power of Dr. Octopus" (the series premiere) and "The Terrible Triumph of Dr. Octopus".

==== Spider-Man (1981) ====

He also made one appearance in the 1980s animated series ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode “Bubble, Bubble, Oil and Trouble” (voiced by [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stanley Jones]]), in which he stole crystals in order to enhance the power of his extra arms.

==== The Incredible Hulk ====

Doctor Octopus was later a guest villain in the 1982 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' animated series, in the 1982 episode "Tomb of the Unknown Hulk", in which he had stolen a [[rocket]] ship in the [[military]] camp.

==== Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends ====

Finally, he appeared in a third-season episode of ''[[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends]]'' in 1983, "Spidey Meets the Girl of Tomorrow". In both of his later two 1980s animated appearances, he was voiced by [[Michael Bell]].

==== Spider-Man: The Animated Series ====

[[Image:doc ock23.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Doctor Octopus in 1990s ''Spider-Man animated series.'']]

Doctor Octopus made several appearances in the 1990s animated series ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. Dr. Octopus used to be Otto Octavius, who was Peter Parker's science teacher at Science Camp. This relationship of former mentor and pupil made Dr Octopus fond of Peter even after his descent into villainy. One day, Octavius created a fusion experiment, using four metal tentacles. When the experiment exploded, Octavius' tentacles were permanently stuck on his back. In [[Dr. Octopus: Armed and Dangerous|his first appearance]], Dr. Octopus kidnaps [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]] and J. Jonah Jameson for ransom from Felicia's mother, as Felicia's mom didn't have patience to fund Ock's experiments before he was a villain. When Peter calls him, Dr. Octopus decides to have Peter bring the ransom. But Ock reveals he wouldn't release Felicia and Jameson anyway but after he was defeated by Spider-Man, who Peter was secretly after Ock threw Peter off into another part of the abandoned space lab Ock hid out in, Dr. Octopus was captured, and was taken to jail.

Later, he became a member of The Insidious Six in the first two episodes of Season 2 and the five-part episode, "[[Six Forgotten Warriors]]" in Season 5, and one of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s enforcers after the first episodes of Season 2, helping him commit crimes. He even came far as unmasking Spider-Man with the Insidious Six but since Spider-Man didn't fight as well as he usually does because it was part of Spider-Man's lively evolution, Ock thought he was a fake. He also came to wiping out Spider-Man's memory and making him think the two were partners-in-crime. But thanks to Spider-Man's fangirl, Taina, and a cabbie named Mousie, he got his memory back and Octavius was sent back to jail.

He eventually became aware that Anastasia Hardy's husband, John Hardesky, was a [[cat burglar]] known as the Cat and used this information to blackmail Mrs. Hardy into giving him his money. But he was abducted by the Kingpin for Octavius to work for the crime lord again and his plans were not to reveal to the world that Mrs. Hardy's husband was a crook but merely use John Hardesky because he was jailed for knowing the super-soldier formula that created [[Captain America]] during [[World War II]].

After Hardesky was kidnapped, Ock was sent to kidnap Felicia to blackmail Hardesky if he didn't reveal the super-solider formula, she'll die. Hardesky revealed the formula and it was tested on Felicia, turning her into the Black Cat.

His final appearance in the show was in the three-part "[[Secret Wars (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|Secret Wars]]", in which he conquered part of the alien planet and renamed his section "Octavia".  When the heroes arrived, he took part not only in the battle against them (upgrading Smythe's robots) but also an inter-villain power struggle.  However, in the end, when Doom absorbed the [[Beyonder]]'s powers, he transported all the villains, including Ock, back to Earth with no memory of what transpired.

In [[Spider Wars|the series finale]] of this show, Doctor Octopus did not appear, but among the other Spider-Men from different realities was a Spider-Man with had metallic tentacles and sunglasses like Doc Ock's.  He explained it was a "souvenir from my last fight with Doc Ock". Exactly what transpired in that fight is unknown.

In all of these episodes, Doc Ock was voiced by [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]], who gave the character a thick Germanic accent. Efrem also voiced the character in the Playstation and N64 Spider-Man game, as well as for a ride at [[Universal Studios]] [[Islands of Adventure]], [[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]].

===Film===
[[Image:2826 DocOck.jpg|right|thumb|frame|Doctor Octopus portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]] in the 2004 film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'']]
The director of the films, [[Sam Raimi]], has stated that Ock was intended to appear in [[Spider-Man (film)|the first film]], teaming up with [[Green Goblin]] but wasn't included because Raimi thought it wouldn't "do the movie justice to have a third origin in there."<ref>{{cite video | title = Making The Amazing | format = DVD | publisher = Sony | year = 2004}}</ref> Doctor Octopus is portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]] in the [[film]] ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004).

Unlike the comic version, who is portrayed as arrogant, the movie version is portrayed as a sympathetic character, with a wife. He meets Peter and talks with him, first about his experiment using an experimental element to create endless energy, and then about love. Peter worries that Octavius might miscalculate, but Octavius brushes it aside, stating that he knows the risk. However, in a lab accident caused by his miscalculations, his wife is killed, and the arms he was using in the experiment become welded onto his body. Distraught over the loss of his wife, blaming Spider-Man, and "hearing" the tentacles speaking to him, he robs a bank, looking to get the money necessary to try his experiment again. Needing the element for his experiment, he goes to [[Harry Osborn]], who makes a deal with Octavius: bring Harry Spider-Man, and the element is his. He goes after Peter, being told that Peter can find Spider-Man, and kidnaps [[Mary-Jane Watson|Mary-Jane]], threatening to tear her flesh from her bones if Spider-Man isn't found. Spider-Man meets Ock atop a clock tower, and a fight ensues, leading to them fighting on an [[rapid transit|elevated subway train]]. Ock destroys the brakes on the train, forcing Spider-Man to stop the train, after which Ock knocks him out and delivers him to Harry. He goes to the docks to carry out his experiment with Mary-Jane, but Spider-Man, learning Ock's location from Harry, arrives and frees Mary-Jane, but Ock has started his experiment. Ock and Spider-Man fight, and Spider-Man unmasks, showing Ock who he is. He reminds Octavius of who he was, and Octavius, swearing that he "will not die a monster" uses his tentacles to drown the experiment, shutting it down, and himself drowning in the process.

He also appears briefly in the beginning of [[Spider-Man 3]], portrayed by [[Alfred Molina]], during the credits showing flashbacks from the old films.

Ock pretended he was reformed and hired Mysterio to frame Spider-Man by having him steal one of Dr. Otto Octavius' new devices. Afterwards, Ock and Carnage released a fog in New York. But Spider-Man destroyed the fog and realized Ock and Carnage framed him. After both are defeated, the Carnage symbiote attaches to Octavius to form the hybrid villain "Monster-Ock". Direct confrontation with this combined foe results in Spider-Man's death; after the player flees from him, his base explodes and the two villains are separated and subdued when they get in contact with the fire. Ock manages to survive, thanks to the symbiote and is knocked unconscious as the symbiote slithers away. He would be saved with Spider-Man from the complete destruction of his lair by the Black Cat, Captain America and Venom. Ock is last seen in the same prison cell with the Scorpion, Rhino and Mysterio, banging his head on one of the cell bars, feeling horrible that not only was he defeated once more by Spider-Man, but he is also in a cell full of idiots. The situation had not changed when he made a cameo appearance in the final cutscene of ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]''.
