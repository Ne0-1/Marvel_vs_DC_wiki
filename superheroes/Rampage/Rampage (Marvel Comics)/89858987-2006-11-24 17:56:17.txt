'''Rampage''' ('''Stuart Clarke''') is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] character, an armored [[supervillain]] who fought the short-lived [[The Champions (comics)|Champions]] team (beginning with Champions #5).

His armor was involved in a later Champions fight, and Clarke himself sought revenge on the Champions even after their disbanding, which eventually put him in conflict with [[Spider-Man]] as well.

Even later, he was freed from prison by [[Wonder Man]]'s enemy [[Lotus (comics)|Lotus]] and participated on the creation of the armored team ''Armed Response''.

As of late [[2006]] and [[The Punisher War Journal#Volume Two|Punisher War Journal]] #1, Stuart is working with the [[Punisher]] during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event. He is obsessed with [[Iron Man]] and is giving Punisher the means to track down high tech supervillians, after Frank took down [[Stilt-Man]] and [[Tinkerer]]. At least for the moment, Stuart seems to be serving in the capacity of Punisher's former weapons expert and information gatherer, [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]].
