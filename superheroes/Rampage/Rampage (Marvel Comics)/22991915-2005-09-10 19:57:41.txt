'''Rampage''' (Stuart Clarke) is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] character, an armored [[supervillain]] who fought the short-lived [[The Champions (comics)|Champions]] team (begining with Champions #5).

His armor was involved in a later Champions fight, and Clarke himself sought revenge on the Champions even after their disbanding, which eventually put him in conflict with [[Spider-Man]] as well.

Even later, he was freed from prison by [[Wonder Man]]'s enemy [[Lotus (character)|Lotus]] and participated on the creation of the armored team ''Armed Response''.
