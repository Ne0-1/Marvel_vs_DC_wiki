'''Clea''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She is the disciple and lover of [[Doctor Strange]]. Created by co-plotters [[Stan Lee]] (writer-editor) and [[Steve Ditko]] (artist), Clea [[first appeared]] in the Doctor Strange feature in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (Nov. 1964).

Clea is a human-appearing being and maternally related to the otherdimensional Faltine race of energy beings. The daughter of [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] and the niece of the demonic tyrant [[Dormammu]], the noble Clea has been, sporadically, ruler of the Dark Dimension, the mystical realm to which Dormammu had been banished and which he subsequently conquered.

==Early history==
The character was introduced during a [[story arc]] in which Doctor Strange confronted Dormammu for the first time. She became Strange's only ally in the Dark Dimension, and soon becomes a captive of her uncle. Clea remained nameless for several issues, referred to as the "captive female", or the "mysterious silver-haired girl". A caption in ''Strange Tales'' #132 noted her father is Dormammu's closest disciple. Her name was eventually revealed in ''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966), almost two years after her first appearance.

During the first Umar story arc (''Strange Tales'' #150-156) nothing indicates that Clea and Umar are related to or even know each other. Indeed, Dormammu's sister mimics her brother's tactics and goes after Clea as a way of hurting Strange. Later, it was revealed that Umar was her mother, and that her father was [[Orini]], a disciple of Dormammu and ruler of the Dark Dimension. After this revelation, Clea and Umar fought and Clea revealed to the inhabitants of the Dark Dimension that her mother didn't care for her subjects at all and was willing to endanger them to defeat Clea. The population became convinced that Clea should be the ruler and the "Flames of Regency" appeared on Clea's head. The Flames of Regency made Clea powerful enough to defeat and banish Umar and she took the throne of the Dark Dimension (''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2, #69-74).

Several months later, Dormammu returned to the Dark Dimension and claimed the throne again. Clea was held hostage to lure in Doctor Strange, but Strange and Clea managed to escape Dormammu and arrived near Umar. Umar tried to kill Strange, but found out that her spells hurt both Clea and Strange. Clea revealed to her mother that Strange and she had exchanged vows and had become one according to the laws of the Dark Dimension. Umar confessed that she didn't want to hurt her daughter and assisted Doctor Strange and Clea in defeating Dormammu. Umar and her new lover [[Baron Mordo]] claimed rulership over the Dark Dimension, but promised Clea that they would not abuse their powers. Clea reluctantly agreed and returned to Earth with Strange. (''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3, #22-24)

Some time later, the Faltinean Flyx appeared to her and told her that Umar and Mordo betrayed her trust. Clea and Flyx gathered an army to defeat Umar and Mordo, but Flyx revealed himself to be Dormammu in disguise. He absorbed the powers of Umar and Mordo and Clea remained in the Dark Dimension as leader of the resistance against Dormammu. (''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3, #48)

In the mid-2000s, Clea appeared in the ''Witches'' series along with [[Jennifer Kale]], [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]], and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]].

==Powers==
Clea is the Sorceress Supreme of the Dark Dimension, possessing vast magical powers. She has exhibited such abilities as forming and throwing magical bolts of energy, conjuring objects and energies, teleporting, telekinesis, controlling othersâ€™ minds, and casting illusions. Presumably, she is capable of replicating any spell performed by her former mentor, Doctor Strange. As she is descended from the Faltine race of beings, it is suggested that she can generate her own mystical energy, like Umar and Dormammu, and draw upon it to fuel her magic. She also possesses greater strength and body density than that of a normal Earth human. Her age is indeterminate, having lived for centuries, but having the form and demeanor of a twenty year-old woman, and the rate at which she ages is unknown.

==Alternate versions==
* In the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-reality]] series ''[[Earth X]]'', Clea is revealed to have betrayed Doctor Strange and to have killed him at the behest of her lover, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], becoming the Sorceress Supreme of that reality. Her treason is discovered by Bruce Banner, and she is quickly taken away by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and imprisoned in Asgard.

* In the alternate-reality [[miniseries]] ''[[Marvel 1602|1602]]'', set in American colonial days, the Clea of the Earth-311 is the wife of English court physician Dr. Stephen Strange.
* In ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' Clea appears as the former wife of Stephen Strange who tried to raise her son away from magic blaming it for the loss of her husband there appears to no be magical background of this Clea an it is unknown if this version related to any magical beings.
