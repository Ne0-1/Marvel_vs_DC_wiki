'''Clea''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She is the beloved of [[Doctor Strange]], and is his common law wife.  She originated from the [[Dark Dimension]], and is the daughter of [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], sister of the demonic [[Dormammu]].  Clea has been, at various points in time, the ruler of her home dimension.  She has powerful mystical powers of her own and was Dr. Strange's pupil early in her career.

==Early history==
The character, created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (November, 1964), where the Master of the Mystic Arts confronts Dormammu for the first time. There, and during several issues, she is Strange's only ally in the Dark Dimension, and quickly becomes a hostage of the Dread One.

She remains nameless for several issues, referred to as the "captive female", or the "mysterious silver-haired girl". A caption in ''Strange Tales'' #132 tells us that her father is Dormammu's closest disciple. Then her name is revealed  in issue #146 (July, 1966), almost two years after her first appearance.

During the first Umar [[story arc]] (''Strange Tales'' #150&mdash;156) nothing indicates that Clea and Umar are related or even know each other. Indeed, Dormammu's sister mimics her brother's tactics and goes after Clea as a way of hurting Strange. Later, it was revealed that Umar was her mother, and that her father was [[Orini]], a disciple of Dormammu and ruler of the Dark Dimension. Umar took control of the Dark Dimension and held Clea as hostage to lure Strange there. Eventually, Clea was freed and joined Strange on Earth as his disciple and lover.

Clea recently appeared in the ''Witches'' series along with [[Jennifer Kale]], [[Satanna]], and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]].

==Alternate realities==
In the graphic novel [[Earth X]], Clea is revealed to have betrayed Dr. Strange and killed him at the behest of her lover, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Her treason is discovered by Bruce Banner, and she is quickly killed by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who decides she is too dangerous to live.
