'''Clea''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She is the disciple and lover of [[Doctor Strange]]. Created by co-plotters [[Stan Lee]] (writer-editor) and [[Steve Ditko]] (artist), Clea [[first appeared]] in the Doctor Strange feature in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (Nov. 1964).

Clea is a human-appearing being and maternally related to the other-dimensional Faltine race of energy beings. The daughter of [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] and the niece of the demonic tyrant [[Dormammu]], the noble Clea has been, sporadically, ruler of the Dark Dimension, the mystical realm to which Dormammu had been banished and which he subsequently conquered.

==Publication history==
The character was introduced during a [[story arc]] in which Doctor Strange confronted Dormammu for the first time. Clea remained nameless for several issues, referred to as the "captive female", or the "mysterious silver-haired girl". It was later noted that her father is Dormammu's closest disciple.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #132</ref> However, it wasn't until two years later that her name was eventually revealed.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #146 (July 1966)</ref>

Initially, nothing indicates that Clea and Umar are related to or even know each other.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #150-156</ref> Indeed, Dormammu's sister mimics her brother's tactics and goes after Clea as a way of hurting Strange. Later, it was revealed that Umar was her mother, and that her father was [[Orini]], a disciple of Dormammu and ruler of the Dark Dimension.

In 2004, Clea appeared in the ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' series along with [[Jennifer Kale]], [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]], and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]].

==Fictional character biography==
Clea observed [[Doctor Strange]] in the Dark Dimension, impressed by his courage. She warned Strange against facing [[Dormammu]], and Dormammu punished her for her betrayal.  Strange forces him to release her, however.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #126-127</ref> She becomes Strange's only ally in the Dark Dimension, and soon becomes a captive of her uncle.

[[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] takes Clea hostage and nearly kills her.  The [[Ancient One]] sends Clea into a pocket dimension to save her from Umar.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #150-155</ref> Clea was found and freed by Doctor Strange, and went to live on Earth with him.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 1 #171-173</ref>

Clea was later captured by [[Silver Dagger (comics)|Silver Dagger]]. Doctor Strange's spirit cohabited in her body so that they could defeat Silver Dagger.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #1-2, 4-5</ref> Umar then attacked Clea on Earth, and Clea battled her.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #6, 9</ref>

Clea helped save herself from being sacrificed by Dormammu, and came to believe [[Morganna Blessing]] loved Strange more than she did.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #51</ref> Clea and Strange later helped lead a rebellion in the Dark Dimension. Clea discovered that Umar was her mother, and Clea defeated Umar in a mystic battle. Clea revealed to the inhabitants of the Dark Dimension that her mother didn't care for her subjects at all and was willing to endanger them to defeat Clea. The population became convinced that Clea should be the ruler and the "Flames of Regency" appeared on Clea's head. The Flames of Regency made Clea powerful enough to defeat and banish Umar and her father Orini from the Dark Dimension, and Clea took the throne of the Dark Dimension.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #69-74</ref>

Clea and Strange exchanged vows and became one according to the laws of the Dark Dimension.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #3</ref> Several months later, Dormammu returned to the Dark Dimension and claimed the throne again. Clea was held hostage to lure in Doctor Strange, but Strange and Clea managed to escape Dormammu and arrived near Umar. Umar tried to kill Strange, but found out that her spells hurt both Clea and Strange. Clea revealed to her mother that she had married Strange. Umar confessed that she didn't want to hurt her daughter and assisted Doctor Strange and Clea in defeating Dormammu. Umar and her new lover [[Baron Mordo]] claimed rulership over the Dark Dimension, but promised Clea that they would not abuse their powers. Clea reluctantly agreed and returned to Earth with Strange.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #21-25</ref>

Some time later, the Faltinean Flyx appeared to her and told her that Umar and Mordo betrayed her trust. Clea and Flyx gathered an army to defeat Umar and Mordo, but Flyx revealed himself to be Dormammu in disguise. He absorbed the powers of Umar and Mordo and Clea remained in the Dark Dimension as leader of the resistance against Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3, #48</ref>

Clea has not appeared herself in Marvel comics for years since this event, though mentioned several times, such as when Doctor Strange told the Illuminati of how she left him to lead the rebellion in Dark Dimension.<ref>''New Avengers" Illuminati'' #4</ref>

Marvel has implied that Clea shall make a return (as a potential candidate) in the search for the new [[Sorcerer Supreme]] in the ''[[Dark Reign]]'' after Strange's use of destructive dark magic cost him the station. Marvel ominously describes Clea as, "Though practically the perfect candidate for the job, one might wonder exactly where her loyalties lie..." and "the daughter of the powerful Umar, Clea's toiled to equal and perhaps even exceed her teacher, Stephen Strange."<ref>http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.7099.New_Avengers%7Ecolon%7E_Magic_Show</ref>

[[Brian Michael Bendis]] has also described Clea as: "Clea is the mistress of the Dark Dimension and she’s Strange’s ex-girlfriend/wife. She was trained by Strange, right there in his home. She was his prized pupil. She was to Strange what he was to the Ancient One [Strange’s instructor in the mystic arts]. But as Mistress of the Dark Dimension she hasn’t been on this plane of existence a lot lately. And who’s going to take her serious{{sic}} in those pants?" <ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20145</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Clea is the Sorceress Supreme of the Dark Dimension, possessing vast powers involving the manipulation of the forces of magic for a variety of effects. She has exhibited such abilities as transmutation, forming and throwing magical bolts of concussive energy, magically constructed animate beings, conjuring objects and energies, teleporting, telekinesis, levitation, mesmerism, thought-casting, controlling others' minds, casting illusions, and the tapping of extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. Presumably, she is capable of replicating any spell performed by her former mentor, Doctor Strange. As she is descended from the Faltine race of beings, it is suggested that she can generate her own mystical energy, like Umar and Dormammu, and draw upon it to fuel her magic. She also possesses greater strength and body density than that of a normal Earth human. Her age is indeterminate and the rate at which she ages is unknown, having lived for centuries but having the form and demeanor of a twenty year-old woman. Clea has defeated the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] in single magical combat, and armed with the Flames of Regency, at the peak of her magical abilities, even rivalled her mother [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] in raw power, thus exceeding that of Doctor Strange himself.

Clea possesses vast knowledge of magical lore through extensive studies of sorcery under Doctor Strange, who also trained her in hand-to-hand combat.
