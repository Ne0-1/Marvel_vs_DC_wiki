'''Ronin''' is a cover identity used by two different heroes in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The Ronin identity was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Joe Quesada]], though the characters who have adopted the identity were pre-existing characters created by other writers. 

The name "[[Ronin]]" refers to the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for a masterless [[samurai]], a lone warrior.

{{main article|Echo (comics)}}
'''Maya Lopez''' was the first person to don the Ronin identity. A [[deaf]] woman with [[List of comic book superpowers#Photographic Reflexes|photographic reflexes]], Maya became Ronin to investigate the [[Silver Samurai]] in Japan. 

Maya Lopez first appeared as Ronin in ''New Avengers'' #11 (November 2005), though the character appeared on the covers of several earlier issues.

[[New Avengers]] writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] revealed in the introduction to the ''New Avengers'' Vol. 1 Hardcover collection that his original intention was to make [[Matt Murdock]] the true identity of Ronin, but could not do so due to a conflict with the plans for the character in the ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' comic book title.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-159/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #159], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 12, 2008</ref>

===Clint Barton===
{{mainarticle|Hawkeye (comics)}}
'''Clint Barton''' is the second person to don the Ronin identity, becoming Ronin when he rejoined the New Avengers in the aftermath of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''. He attempted to hand the costume back to Echo after she was rescued from the Hand, but Echo declined and allowed him to keep it.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Ronin===
[[Image:Ultimateronin.PNG|thumb|right|Ultimate Ronin, from a preview image from ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #108]]

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Ronin first appeared ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #108.  Ronin is one of the [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] of [[Moon Knight#Ultimate Moon Knight|Moon Knight]], and was created to infiltrate the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin's]] ([[List_of_acronyms_and_initialisms:_A#AK|a.k.a]] Wilson Fisk) service. The Kingpin tells Ronin to prove himself by retrieving [[Alternate versions of Spider-Man#Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]].

Ronin drives a school bus into Midtown High School and starts firing a gun to get Spider-Man to fight. [[Alternate versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate_Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]], who has recently enrolled there as a student, confronts him, but is knocked unconscious shortly before Spider-Man arrives. The two engage in a brutal battle that is mirrored in a fight between Moon Knight and Ronin in his mind (since they are two different personalities within the same person); Ronin knocks Spider-Man unconscious in the end. (The Moon Knight personality is also apparently "killed.")  Ronin uses Spider-Man's own [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Web-shooters|web-shooters]] to leave the high school, and takes him to the Kingpin, who interrogates the hero at his hideout. 

Kingpin then defeats Ronin, revealing that he already knew his identity. Ronin is then taken to a river by two of the Kingpin's henchmen and shot in the head. Somehow he survives this and goes to the police to provide evidence about Wilson Fisk's attempt to murder him. He has to reveal his secret identity to do this, but it does lead to the arrest of the Kingpin and the media referring to him as a hero.
