The persona of Ronin was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Joe Quesada]].

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Ultimate Ronin.png|thumb|right|The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Ronin (left).]]The [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent of Ronin is an [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]  of [[Moon Knight|Marc Spector]].<ref name="ultimatespiderman108">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108 (June 2007)</ref> In order to infiltrate the services of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Ronin proves himself by retrieving [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]]. Ronin drives a school bus into Midtown High School and starts firing a gun to get Spider-Man to fight. [[Kitty Pryde]] confronts Ronin, but is knocked unconscious shortly before Spider-Man arrives. The two engage in a brutal battle that is mirrored in a fight between Moon Knight and Ronin in his mind (as the two different personalities within the same person); Ronin knocks Spider-Man unconscious in the end (as Moon Knight's personality is also apparently "killed"). Ronin uses Spider-Man's own web-shooters to leave the high school, and takes the youth to the Kingpin to interrogate at the Kingpin's hideout.<ref name="ultimatespiderman108"/> But the Kingpin then attacks Ronin, revealing that the Kingpin already knew of Ronin's true identity.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #109</ref> Ronin is then taken to a river by the Kingpin's two henchmen and shot in the head. However, he somehow survives this and goes to the police to provide evidence about the Kingpin's attempt to murder him, revealing his secret identity to do this but leads to the Kingpin's arrest and the media referring to him as a hero.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #110</ref>
