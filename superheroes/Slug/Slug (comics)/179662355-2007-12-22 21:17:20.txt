'''Slug''' ('''Ulysses X. Lugman''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Ulysses Lugman was born in [[Miami, Florida]]. He is a Miami-based drug dealer whose business was once toppled by the [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], with the assistance of [[Captain America]] and [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]]. He seems to have rebounded, as he was shown in a meeting between the United States' major criminal empires in order to divide the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s former territory. Later, he was seen bowing under the pressure and blackmail of [[Don Fortunato]], who wished to be the new kingpin. [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] help break up this meeting, seemingly leaving Ulysses free with his territory intact. He was recently seen imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]], a prison for superhuman criminals.

Someone that looks like Slug was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate <ref>New Avengers #35 (2007)</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
The Slug's only "power" is his immense fat: he may weigh more than one thousand pounds. Unlike the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], the Slug has no means of compensating for this mass, so he is almost immobile when not making use of a high-tech personal hovercraft. It has been suggested that the Slug is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], with his mutation allowing him to live and function (albeit in a limited fashion) with his massive girth. Offensively, the Slug is known to asphyxiate his victims (usually underlings who failed or displeased him) in the folds of his fat.
