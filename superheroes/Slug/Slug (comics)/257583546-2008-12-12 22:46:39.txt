'''Slug''' ('''Ulysses X. Lugman''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Ulysses Lugman was born in [[Miami, Florida]]. He is a Miami-based drug dealer whose business is toppled by the [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], with the assistance of [[Captain America]] and [[Vagabond (comics)|Vagabond]]. 

Lugman is one of the villains shown in the crossover event ''Dead Man's Hand''. A mysterious organization creates a meeting in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] in order to divide up the territory and related situations of the deposed criminal master mind the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Among the many criminal groups attended are the [[Secret Empire]], [[Werner Von Strucker]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead's]] group. The situation falls apart due to various factors, including infighting among the group leaders and the slightly successful infiltration of [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]]. 

Having been warned by Nomad's enemy the 'Favor Broker', Lugman attempts to flee the situation in a vehicle specially designed to accommodate his weight. The vigilantes [[Daredevil]], [[Punisher]] and Nomad track down the vehicle due to its unique size and the small number of ways out of town. It is Nomad who has a personal stake in the confrontation, hating Lugman especially. Circumstance saves Lugman's life as it is Nomad and not the criminal-murdering Punisher who gets to him first. After a moral quandary and the depressing realization that Lugman has simply forgotten Nomad, the vigilante hero knocks him out. Despite this, Punisher tries to kill Lugman, only to realize his weapon is empty.

Later, Lugman is seen bowing under the pressure and blackmail of [[Don Fortunato]], who wishes to be the new kingpin of crime. [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] help break up this meeting, seemingly leaving Ulysses free with his territory intact. He was recently seen imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]], a prison for superhuman criminals.

He is also a major opponent of [[Poison (comics)|Poison]].

=== Post-Civil War ===
Slug breaks out of the Raft and joins the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s criminal empire. He helps them fight the New Avengers, but is taken down by Dr. Strange.

=== Secret Invasion ===
As Hood's crime syndicate are questioning one of a group of Skrulls that had tried to take [[Madame Masque]], it is discovered that Slug is a Skrull in disguise. As a result, the Skrull posing as Slug is killed by the Hood. The others wonder when Slug had been replaced. <ref>New Avengers #46</ref> This can be traced back to ''New Avengers: Most Wanted Files'', where Spider-Man comments that Slug had lost nearly half of his body weight.

== Powers and abilities ==
The Slug's only "power" is his immense fat: he may weigh more than one thousand pounds. Unlike the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], the Slug has no means of compensating for this mass, so he is almost immobile when not making use of a high-tech personal hovercraft. It has been suggested{{Fact|date=December 2008}} that the Slug is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], with his mutation allowing him to live and function (albeit in a limited fashion) with his massive girth. The Slug is known to asphyxiate his victims (usually underlings who failed or displeased him) in the folds of his fat.

Because of his weight, Slug rides specially designed heavy-duty wheelchairs fitted with tank treads or heavy tires. His chairs appear to operate by remote control, and often feature built-in flotation devices or rocket boosters for air escape. For longer distances, the Slug rides in a custom semi-trailer.
