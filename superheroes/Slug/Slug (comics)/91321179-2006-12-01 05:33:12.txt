The '''Slug''' (real name: '''Ulysses X. Lugman''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a Miami-based drug dealer whose business was once toppled by the [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]]. He seems to have rebounded, as he was shown in a meeting between the United States' major criminal empires in order to divide the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s former territory. He was recently seen imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]], a prison for superhuman criminals.

The Slug's only "power" is his immense fat: he may weigh more than one thousand pounds. Unlike the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], the Slug has no means of compensating for this mass, so he is almost immobile when not making use of a high-tech personal hovercraft. It has been suggested that the Slug is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], with his mutation alloweing him to live and function (albeit in a limited fashion) with his massive girth. Offensively, the Slug is known to asphyxiate his victims (usually underlings who failed or displeased him) in the folds of his fat.
