'''The Blazing Skull''' ('''Mark Anthony Todd''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created during the 1930-'40s [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] for Marvel's predecessor, [[Timely Comics]]. He [[first appeared]] in ''[[Mystic (comics)|Mystic Comics]]'' # 5 (March 1941), though his writer and artist creators are unknown.

==Publication history==
The Blazing Skull debuted in "The Story of Mark Todd", a nine-page tale in the comic that also introduced cover character the [[Black Marvel]] and fellow superhero The Terror. He continued to appear in ''Mystic Comics'' through issue #9 (May 1941), with at least one story ("The Thing", in #8) confirmably penciled by Golden Age great [[Syd Shores]].

==Character biography==
===Golden Age===
[[Foreign correspondent]] Mark Todd, assigned by his newspaper to cover the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], was forced to take refuge in a cave during an [[artillery]] [[bombardment]] by the Japanese. There he met the Skull Men, a strange race with burning skulls for heads.  They informed him he had been chosen by the forces of destiny to be the champion of freedom, and they began his training, which included teaching him immunity to fire. Once his training was completed, he returned home, and, motivated by the horrors of [[Nazism]], donned a uniform with a flaming mask (in honor of the Skull Men) and became the Blazing Skull.

As time passed and he continued to master the Skull Men's teachings, he would gain the ability to turn his flesh invisible, mimicking his teachers appearance, and stopped using the mask.

Soon afterward, Todd came into contact with the [[World War II|WWII]] superhero team, the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], aiding them against a team of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] superhumans and saving the life of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].  He also fought alongside the team during a massed Allied superhuman airdrop into a Nazi stronghold.

As the war in [[Europe]] came to a close, the Blazing Skull teamed with [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] and the [[Destroyer (Golden Age)|Destroyer]] to break up an enemy spy-ring in [[England]].

A [[simulacrum]] of the Blazing Skull was temporarily created from the mind of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], and the Golden Age [[Angel (Golden Age)|Angel]] and [[Vision (Golden Age)|Vision]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]], in ''The Avengers'' Vol. 1, #97 (Mach 1972).

==Modern-day==
The Blazing Skull reappeared &mdash; unaged due to his healing factor <!--according to marvel.com's bio--> &mdash; in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' Vol. 2, #82 (July 2004), as a captive. He was recruited by the [[U.S. Agent]] into a new, present-day version of the Invaders, and co-starred in the 2004-05 series ''[[Invaders (comics)|The New Invaders]]''. He has mentioned that between the war and the present he has fought as a superhero at different times in different places, even using different names, including the '''Smoking Head''' during the 1960s.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to the training he received from the Skull Men, Blazing Skull is immune to fire.  He also possesses superhuman strength, a regenerative healing factor, and the ability to turn his flesh invisible, giving him the appearance of a walking skeleton. He later gained the ability to project and expel flame.
