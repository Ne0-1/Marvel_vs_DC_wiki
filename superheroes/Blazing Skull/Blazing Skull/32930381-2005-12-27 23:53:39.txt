'''Blazing Skull''' is a [[superhero]] from the fictional [[Marvel Universe]].

Mark Todd's journey into superherodom began when he was assigned to cover the [[Sino-Japanese War]] by his newspaper.  He was forced to take refuge in a nearby cave during an [[artillery]] [[bombardment]] by the Japanese and there he met the Skull Men.  The Skull Men were a strange race with burning skulls for heads.  They informed him he had been chosen by the forces of destiny to be the champion of freedom and they began his training, teaching him how to become immune to fire, amongst other things.  Once his training was completed, he returned to human civilization and motivated by the horrors wrought by the [[Nazi]], he donned a flaming mask (in honor of the Skull Men) and became Blazing Skull.  As time passed and he continued to master the Skull Men's teachings, he would gain the ability to turn his flesh invisible, mimicking his teachers appearance and stopped using the mask.

It was not long before Todd came into contact with the [[World War II|WWII]] superhero team, the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], aiding them against a team of Axis oriented superhumans and saving the life of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]].  He also joined them during a massed Allied superhuman airdrop into Nazi European stronghold.

As the war in [[Europe]] was coming to a close, Blazing Skull teamed with [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] and the [[Destroyer (comics)|Destroyer]] to break up an enemy spy-ring in [[England]].

==Powers and abilities==
Due to the training he received from the Skull Men, Blazing Skull is immune to fire.  He also possesses superhuman strength.  His most unique power though, is the ability to turn his flesh invisible, giving him the appearance of a walking skeleton.
