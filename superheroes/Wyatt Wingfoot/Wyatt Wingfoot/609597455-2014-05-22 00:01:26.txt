After the death of Wingfoot's grandfather, the Keewazi chief, the Council of Elders called on Wyatt to accept the position as tribal chieftain.  At the same time, the alien known as [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]] came to Oklahoma to devour Earth's resources, and the Fantastic Four arrive for battle.  Wyatt met the foursome's new member [[She-Hulk]], and he helped the team battle Terminus. Wingfoot postponed his investiture as chief of the Keewazi, and followed the Fantastic Four instead, returning to New York with [[Mister Fantastic]] and She-Hulk.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #269-270</ref>  Alongside the Fantastic Four, he journeyed to an alternate Earth, and helped battle the Warlord.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #271-273</ref> He soon began an intimate relationship with She-Hulk, and helped her confront magazine publisher T.J.

He was part of a group of innocent citizens kidnapped by a teleportation beam when [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] went after She-Hulk. He helps her to escape confinement by pressing the appropriate amount of weight onto the pressure-sensitive floor of the cell they were confined in. This was a difficult task as She-Hulk is much larger than his already tall form. It turns out this incident was part of an internal power struggle within S.H.I.E.L.D. and to further complicate things, one of the citizens was actually a sentient colony of cockroaches. They would go after the corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in charge, endangering everyone on board and anyone the [[helicarrier]] might crash in to. She-Hulk soon neutralizes the threat, and Wyatt survives the crash of the helicarrier.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18: ''She-Hulk''</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, Wyatt then battles [[Kristoff Vernard|Doctor Doom]] (actually Kristoff).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #278-279</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, Wyatt later investigated a temporal zone surrounding Central City, California.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #293-295</ref> Wyatt then attended the wedding of Johnny Storm and Alicia Masters (actually [[Lyja]] in disguise).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #300</ref> Wyatt later became engaged to She-Hulk; alongside She-Hulk, he battled Carlton Beatrice, and then broke off the engagement.<ref>''She-Hulk: Ceremony'' #1-2</ref> Wyatt later accompanies Ka-Zar and [[Shanna the She-Devil]] back to the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Guns of the Savage Land'' Graphic Novel</ref>
