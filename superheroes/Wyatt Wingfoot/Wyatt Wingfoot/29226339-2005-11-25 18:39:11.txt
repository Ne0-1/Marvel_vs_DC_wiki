'''Wyatt Wingfoot''' is a fictional [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  While having no superpowers of his own, Wingfoot spends much of his time in the company of the [[Fantastic Four]].  Even with his lack of powers, Wingfoot is an excellent athlete, marksman, hand-to-hand fighter, tracker and animal trainer and bails his friends out of numerous potentially devestating situations.  It should be noted that this [[Stan Lee]] creation is one of the few Native American characters in [[comic book]] history.  

Wyatt Wingfoot was born on the fictional Keewazi Reservation in Oklahoma.  He chose to leave the reservation to attain a college degree from a university in New York.  At the university, Wingfoot became roommates and friends with [[Johnny Storm]], better known as the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] of the Fantastic Four.  After some occasional adventures with the Fantastic Four, Wingfoot completed his degree and returned to the Keewazi Reservation.  

After the death of Wyatt Wingfoot's grandfather, the Keewazi chief, the Council of Elders called on Wingfoot to accept the position.  At the same time the alien known as [[Terminus]], the world killer, arrived in Oklahoma to devour the Earth's resources and the Fantastic Four showed up for battle.  Wingfoot turned down the position as chief and followed the foursome instead.  He eventually began an intimate relationship with the foursome's newest member, [[She-Hulk]].

Wyatt Wingfoot eventually returned to his tribe, which had just discovered large oil deposits under their land.  Wingfoot helped to set up a deal between the United States government and the Keewazi tribe.  Most of Wingfoot's recent appearances are at the side of She-Hulk.
