'''Wyatt Wingfoot''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic-book]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who [[first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #50 (May 1966). While having no superpowers, he has spent much time in the company of the [[Fantastic Four]] due to his friendship with [[Johnny Storm]], the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]].  Even with his lack of powers, Wingfoot is an excellent athlete, marksman, hand-to-hand fighter, tracker and animal trainer, and has been of timely help in numerous potentially devastating situations. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he is one of the relatively few modern [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] characters in comics. 

==Fictional character biography==
Wyatt, son of "Big Will Wingfoot — the greatest [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[decathlon]] star this country ever had!",<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #51 (June 1966): "This Man...This Monster!"  Description per Empire State University football coach Jim Thorpe — a sly reference to real-life Native American decathlete [[Jim Thorpe]].</ref> was born on the fictional Keewazi [[Indian reservation|Reservation]] in [[Oklahoma]]. He left to attend college at the equally fictional Empire State University in [[New York City]]. There, Wingfoot became roommates and friends with Johnny Storm. Wyatt has occasional adventures with Storm and the others. He assists in tracking down a 'threat' to frightened citizens, which simply turns out to be the lost canine of the [[Inhumans]], the teleporting [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]]. Wyatt soon completes his degree and returns to the reservation.

After the death of Wingfoot's grandfather, the Keewazi chief, the Council of Elders called on Wyatt to accept the position.  At the same time, the alien known as [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]] came to Oklahoma to devour Earth's resources, and the Fantastic Four arrive for battle.  Wingfoot turns down the position as chief and followed the FF instead.  He later began an intimate relationship with the foursome's member [[She-Hulk]]. He continued this relationship after she left the team (after the Thing's return) and ended up becoming involved in her adventures as well. He was part of a group of innocent citizens kidnapped by a teleportation beam when [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] went after She-Hulk. He helps her to escape confinement by pressing the appropriate amount of weight onto the pressure-sensitive floor of the cell they were confined in. This was a difficult task as She-Hulk is much larger then his already tall form. It turns out this incident was part of an internal power struggle within S.H.I.E.L.D. and to further complicate things, one of the citizens was actually a sentient colony of cockaroaches. They would go after the corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in charge, endangering everyone on board and anyone the [[helicarrier]] might crash in to. She-Hulk soon nuetralizes the threat. 

Wyatt would join She-Hulk for some adventures in her own series. There, like many of the cast members, he became aware of his own reality as a fictional being. 

Wingfoot eventually returnes to his tribe when they discovered large oil deposits under their land, and helped broker a deal between the [[United States government]] and the Keewazi.
