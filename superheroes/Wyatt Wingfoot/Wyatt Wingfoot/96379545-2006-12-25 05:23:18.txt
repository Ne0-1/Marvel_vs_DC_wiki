'''Wyatt Wingfoot''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic-book]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who [[first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #50 (May 1966). While having no superpowers, he has spent much time in the company of the [[Fantastic Four]] due to his friendship with [[Johnny Storm]], the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]].  Even with his lack of powers, Wingfoot is an excellent athlete, marksman, hand-to-hand fighter, tracker and animal trainer, and has been of timely help in numerous potentially devastating situations. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he is one of the relatively few modern [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] characters in comics. 

Wyatt, son of "Big Will Wingfoot — the greatest [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[decathlon]] star this country ever had!",<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #51 (June 1966): "This Man...This Monster!"  Description per Empire State University football coach Jim Thorpe — a sly reference to real-life Native American decathlete [[Jim Thorpe]].</ref> was born on the fictional Keewazi [[Indian reservation|Reservation]] in [[Oklahoma]]. He left to attend college at the equally fictional Empire State University in [[New York City]]. There, Wingfoot became roommates and friends with Johnny Storm.  After some occasional adventuring with Storm and with the team, Wingfoot completed his degree and returned to the reservation.  

After the death of Wingfoot's grandfather, the Keewazi chief, the Council of Elders called on Wyatt to accept the position.  At the same time, the alien known as [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]] came to Oklahoma to devour Earth's resources, and the Fantastic Four arrived for battle.  Wingfoot turned down the position as chief and followed the FF instead.  He later began an intimate relationship with the foursome's temporary member, [[She-Hulk]].

Wingfoot eventually returned to his tribe when they discovered large oil deposits under their land, and helped broker a deal between the [[United States government]] and the Keewazi.

==Alternate versions==
During the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" company-wide [[fictional crossover|crossover]], an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] analog of Wingfoot was a government agent assigned to monitor independent [[spaceflight]] and [[Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture|extraterrestrial]] meetings. In the course of his duties, he was kidnapped by the alien [[Skrulls]], but eventually escaped.

A "Lord Wingfoot" appears in the [[Marvel 1602]] miniseries ''1602: Fantastick Four'' as a rival to John Storm for the hand of Doris Evans. According to Storm the man is a "godless brute".
