'''Moondragon''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A powerful [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]], [[telepathy|telepath]], and [[martial arts|martial artist]], Moondragon's most notable characteristics are her shaved head and her arrogance. She has recently been confirmed to be a [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. She first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' vol. 1 #54 (January, 1973). The issue was scripted by [[Bill Everett]] and [[Mike Friedrich]] and drawn by Everett and [[George Tuska]].

Her real name is Heather Douglas, the daughter of Arthur Douglas, whose reanimated corpse was made into [[Drax the Destroyer]]. When Heather was still a girl, her father was driving her and her mother through the desert when they accidentally happened to see the spaceship of [[Thanos]] land; the space villain didn't want any witnesses so he blew their car up. Heather was thrown clear off and survived, but her parents were killed. She was found by Thanos' father, [[Mentor (Marvel Comics)|Mentor]], who took her to his home world, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], to be raised. While there, Heather studied the Titans' ways and gained her mental and physical powers. However, she came under the influence of a demon called The Dragon of the Moon; she believed she had resisted it, which filled her with pride, and she took the name Moondragon as a result. 

She first returned to Earth under the guise of "Madam McEvil" for the purpose of developing means to combat Thanos; this led to the creations of some villains, like [[Angar the Screamer]]. She then revealed her true identity and helped the [[Avengers (Comics)|Avengers]] in their first confrontation with Thanos. She met the heroine [[Hellcat]] and took her to Titan so she could train her.

Moondragon was one of the three candidates to be the "Celestial Madonna" who was prophesied to give birth to a universal savior, but she lost to [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]].

Moondragon was present when the Avengers confronted [[Korvac]]; her powers allowed her to see into his mind while they fought, and she decided that his goal of saving the universe by ruling it was noble; she stayed out of the battle until Korvac, dejected, committed suicide.

Afterwards, she left Earth with her father (who was now Drax) and found a planet immersed in war, so she decided to take mental control of all its inhabitants to force them to live in peace. This caused her to believe herself to be like a goddess. When Drax confronted her, she killed him with her mental powers. The Avengers intervened, and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] took her before a real god- his father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], to be judged. He condemned her to wear a magical headband that would reduce her mental powers until she had overcome her arrogance. He also assigned The [[Valkyrie (comics)|Valkyrie]] to be her guardian. 

When Valkyrie rejoined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], Moondragon was forced to come along. She soon discovered that the Dragon of the Moon had been influencing her all along. She managed to reject it fully, and for the first time, started to gain friends in the team; eventually the headband came loose by itself. Unfortunately, soon after she was infected with mutated spores and started to die; the Dragon appeared again and told her it could save her life, but only if she agreed to be its host. She accepted, and, now an evil being, battled the Defenders, until four of them sacrificed themselves to kill them both her and the Dragon.

Heather's soul managed to survive, and, now free from the Dragon again, contacted a cousin of hers; through her, she was able to obtain a new body for herself, a clone created on Titan. For a while, she and her cousin, who became the heroine [[Sundragon]], adventured together in space.

When [[Adam Warlock]] sought people to help him safeguard the [[Infinity Gems]], he chose Moondragon to keep the Mind Gem- but only after fixing it so Moondragon could not exploit the gem's full power. Still, she agreed to join his team, the [[Infinity Watch]]. She eventually lost the gem when it was stolen by [[Rune.]]

Moondragon later became an associate of Genis (the third [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]), determined to help him control his cosmic awareness. During this time, she fell in love with Marlo Chandler, the wife of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (whom Captain Marvel was bonded to). The two eloped on a lesbian relationship (rare for a mainstream comicbook, especailly with two established characters) to the reluctant understanding of Rick. Some time later, Marlo got over her feelings for Moondragon, and decided to return to Rick. Moondragon told her she must have accidentally prodded her telepathicly into the relationship, but this was a lie to make the break up easier, and in truth Moondragon was heartbroken, and she left shortly after with [[Phyla-Vell]]. She has not been seen since.
