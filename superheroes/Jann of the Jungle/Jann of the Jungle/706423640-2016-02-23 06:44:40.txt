==Publication history==

Jann of the Jungle is really Jane Hastings, a circus trapeze artist and animal trainer.  When she comes to the jungle as a stunt double for the female star of an adventure movie, the natives on the set acclaim her as 'Jann'.  Many years ago, a white woman was the friend and protector of the Africans but she met a white man who was a lion hunter and left with him.  This was Jane Hastings' grandmother.  Feeling at home in the verdure, Jane decides to stay on as the new 'Jann of the Jungle'.  Cinematographer/photographer Pat Mahoney stays too, to watch over the new Jann.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Writer - Don Rico, Artist - Art Peddy|title=Jungle Tales|date=September 1954|issue=# 1|publisher=Atlas Comics}} </ref>
