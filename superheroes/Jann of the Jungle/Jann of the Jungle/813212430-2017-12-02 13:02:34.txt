When she comes to the jungle as a stunt double for the female star of an adventure movie, the natives on the set acclaim her as "Jann". Many years ago, a white woman was the friend and protector of the Africans but she met a white man who was a lion hunter and left with him. This was Hastings' grandmother. Feeling at home in the verdure, Hastings stays on as the new Jann of the Jungle.
