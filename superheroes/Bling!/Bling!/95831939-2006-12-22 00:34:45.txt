'''Bling!''' ('''Roxanne "Roxy" Washington''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]].  Her first appearance was in ''X-Men'' (2nd series) #171.

==Fictional character biography==
Roxy Washington is daughter of [[hip-hop]] couple Roy "Daddy Libido" Washington and Angel "Sexy Mutha" Depres, both very popular hip hop artists. Having appeared in her parents' rap videos from a young age, Washington was often targeted by would-be kidnappers and assassins.

Destined to follow in her parents' footsteps, Washington rather turned her back on the music industry and enrolled as a student at the Xavier Institute under the tutelage of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].  At the Institute, Washington proved herself more interested in improving herself rather in the escalating human/mutant situation. Her school record shows her to be a good and attentive student with a strong sense of responsibility. 

As a member of Gambit's squad, Washington was forced to deal with the arrival of newcomer Foxx's infatuation with her teacher, despite being attracted to Foxx herself, until Foxx was revealed to be the shapeshifting [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Whether she considers herself [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] is not yet known. Bling retained her powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. She has been seen helping out with [[Havok]]'s squad during the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels']] arrival and [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] return due to lack of members, particularly [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]'s depowerment, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s frequent disappearances, and Gambit's betrayal.

As Washington alone has aided the X-Men on several risky missions, it seems the X-Men find her suited for missions.  Her official status, however, is unclear.

== Powers ==
Her bone marrow is able to produce diamond shards of varying quality, giving her skin a crystalline appearance, which allows her to expel shards from her body at high velocity and grants her enhanced durability.
