'''Bling''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]].  Her first appearance was in ''X-Men'' (2nd series) #171.

Roxy Washington was born into hip-hop "royalty" as the daughter of Roy "Daddy Libido" Washington and Angel "Sexy Mutha" Depres. Having appeared in her parents' rap videos from a young age, Washington was often targeted by would-be kidnappers and assassins.

Destined to follow in her parents' footsteps, Washington turned her back on that life and enrolled as a student at the Xavier Institute under the tutelage of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. It appears that Washington is more concerned with improving herself rather than the escalating human/mutant situation. Her school record shows her to be a good and attentive student with a strong sense of responsibility. 

As a member of Gambit's squad, Washington was forced to deal with the arrival of newcomer Foxx's infatuation with her teacher, despite being attracted to Foxx herself, until Foxx was revealed to be the shapeshifting [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Whether she considers herself [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] is not yet known.
