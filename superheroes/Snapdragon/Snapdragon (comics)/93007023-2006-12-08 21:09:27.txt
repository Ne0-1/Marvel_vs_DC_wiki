'''Snapdragon''' (real name '''Sheoke Sanada''') is a [[Japan]]ese [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]].

==History==
A skilled martial artist, Snapdragon was hired to defeat the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] in [[Japan]].  She succeeded on her mission, but Black Widow soon regained her composure and quickly dispatched Snapdragon.  Later, Snapdragon joined [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]] and became one of her lieutenants.  There, she found long-time enemy [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]].  The two were trained by [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] in [[Taskmaster]]'s Academy, but Diamondback had subsequently dishonored Snapdragon in some form.  While on the S.S. Superia cruise ship, Snapdragon apprehended Diamondback and threw her off, leaving her to drown.  Diamondback eventually recovered, and during their rematch, choked Snapdragon to death.  Her body was returned to Japan and cremated by her brother, Kono.
