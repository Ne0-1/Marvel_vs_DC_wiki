'''Blok''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the 30th century of the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He has a massive, stony body possessed of incredible strength and endurance.

==Origins==
Blok first appeared as a member of the [[League of Super-Assassins]], where he was manipulated by [[Tharok]] into attacking the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Blok, the last of his species, a silicon-based life form that were the original inhabitants of the planet [[Dryad]], had been convinced by Tharok that the Legion were seeking to destroy his home world, when in fact they were working to save it. When he learned that the Legionnaires were not his enemies, he turned on the Assassins and eventually joined the Legion.

Blok was relatively slow to acclimatize to life in the Legion, though he eventually forged a close bond with two of his teammates, [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]] and the [[White Witch (comics)|White Witch]], the latter with which he spend a great deal of his leisure time perusing the Legion's voluminous archives. He remained with the team for several years, eventually choosing to leave following the catastrophic [[Black Dawn]] affair and the increased scrutiny and suspicion of Earthgov towards all Legion activities. He eventually found his way to the Puppet Planetoid, where he spent a few years in isolated contemplation. Shortly thereafter [[Polar Boy]] officially disbanded the Legion of Super-Heroes.

==Death==
In 2994, Blok's former teammates [[Cosmic Boy|Rokk Krinn]] and [[Chameleon Boy|Reep Daggle]] began to reorganize the team, a move which immediately attracted the attention of the corrupt Earthgov. In order to discourage and demoralize the new effort, the alien [[Dominators]] who had been secretly controlling Earthgov for years hired [[Roxxas the Butcher]] to seek out and kill Blok as a warning to his other teammates. Roxxas tracked Blok down to the Puppet Planetoid and carried out his mission with ruthless efficiency, delivering Blok's dismembered corpse to the ranch home of [[Lightning Lad|Garth]] and [[Saturn Girl|Imra Ranzz]] on [[Winath]]. Far from demoralizing the other Legionnaires, however, Roxxas's act galvanized them into action, and it was directly following their discovery of Blok's murder than the Legion of Super-Heroes was officially refounded.

==Notes==
With Legion continuity rebooted, Blok never existed. However, another member of the Dryad race does exist in current continuity: Strata of [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]. It has yet to be seen if other Dryadians exist. Blok has yet to appear in the current 're-imagining' of the Legion.
