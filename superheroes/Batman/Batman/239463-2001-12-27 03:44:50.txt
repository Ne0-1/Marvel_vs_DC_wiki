'''Batman''' is a fictional [[comic book]] [[superhero]] created by [[Bob Kane]] and [[Bill Finger]] in [[1939]]. He first appeared in the title [[Detective Comics]], and is currently the lead character of a number of comic books published by [[DC Comics]] (in fact, "DC" was originally an acronym for ''Detective Comics''.) Batman and [[Superman]] are DC Comics' two most popular and recognizable characters.



In most versions of the Batman [[mythos]], Batman (also referred to as "the Batman") is the alter-ego of Bruce Wayne, a millionaire playboy industrialist. Bruce Wayne was driven to fight crime after his parents were murdered by a mugger when he was a child. He wears a bat-like costume to frighten his enemies. The details of the costume have changed with each new incarnation of the character, except for its most distinctive element: a cowl with a pair of pointed ears. He also wears a stylized bat emblem on his chest.



Batman operates in [[Gotham City]], a fictional city modelled after [[New York]]. He operates from the "Batcave", a cavern located beneath Bruce Wayne's manor.



Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superhuman abilities. Instead, he fights with [[martial arts]], high-tech gadgets, and esoteric weapons like the ''batarang'' (a boomarang shaped like a bat). He is also typically portrayed as a brilliant

tactician and detective.



Nicknames for the Batman include ''The Dark Knight'', ''The Caped Crusader'', and ''The World's Greatest Detective''.



=== Supporting Characters ===



Bruce Wayne has a butler, Alfred, who knows his [[secret identity]]. Alfred typically holds the fort at the Batcave, and does not accompany Batman on his cases.



Batman is aided by James ("Jim") Gordon, the police commissioner of Gotham City. Gordon provides Batman with information to help him solve cases; in return, Batman helps deliver criminals to the police. In most versions of the mythos, Gordon is ignorant of Batman's identity. 



The original Batman comic book introduced "[[Robin]], the Boy Wonder", a teenage [[sidekick]]. Robin's real name was Dick Grayson, an orphan who was Bruce Wayne's ward. In the current comic book [[continuity]], Grayson grew up and switched to the identity of "Nightwing", continuing as an assistant to Batman.



In late 1989, DC Comics polled Batman readers on whether or not to kill off the second Robin, Jason Todd. They voted "yes" by a small margin, and Todd was subsequently murdered by the [[Joker]] in the ''Death in the Family'' storyline. In 1991, Batman took in Timothy Drake as the third (and current) Robin.



Batman has one of the most distinctive rogues' galleries in comics, including supervillains such as the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman, Two-face, and the Riddler. However, some versions of the Batman mythos pit him against more ordinary enemies, such as [[Mafia|mobsters]].



=== Batman in Popular Culture ===



Since his introduction, Batman has been one of the most famous comic book characters, and is known even to people who do not read the comics. In addition to DC's comic books, he has appeared in movies, TV shows,

and novels; see below.



In [[1953]], the book [[Seduction of the Innocent]] by psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]] was published. Wertham used Batman and Robin to attack the comic book medium. He insinuated that Batman and Robin had a [[pedophilia|pedophilic]] relationship, and asserted that the bare legs in Robin's costume encouraged [[homosexuality]]. He succeeded in raising a public outcry, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. Nowadays, most comic book readers regard these accusations as utterly baseless, and a particularly amusing example of [[homophobia]].



Batman has always been an unusually (though not uniquely) grim superhero, particularly for a [[golden age of comics|Golden Age]] character. He is driven by vengeance, and wears a frightening costume; the contrast to characters like [[Superman]] is stark. The grimness is not a constant; in some incarnations of the character, it evaporates into camp and even comedy.



In [[1989]], writer [[Frank Miller]] grounded Batman firmly in his grim and gritty roots with the comic book miniseries [[/Batman - Year one|Batman: Year One]] and [[The Dark Knight Returns]]. In both, Batman's story runs parallel Gordon's; in ''Year One'', Gordon has not yet become the police commisioner, and is instead a middle-aged cop with a shady past working to redeem himself amidst Gotham's corrupt police force. In ''Dark Knight'', Gordon is forced to retire from his post as police commissioner.  These stories gave Gordon's character a depth he had seldom achieved before.



The Miller series have set the tone for the franchise, including [[Tim Burton|Tim Burton's]] Batman movies, the [[1990s]] animated series, and the ongoing comic book series.



=== Batman in other media ===



There was a [[1960s]] ''Batman'' [[television]] series, with [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as Robin. The series was marked for its high camp, and continues to be the version many associate with the Batman character.



In the [[1990s]], there was an [[Animation|animated]] series.



A number of Batman [[film|films]] have also been made:
