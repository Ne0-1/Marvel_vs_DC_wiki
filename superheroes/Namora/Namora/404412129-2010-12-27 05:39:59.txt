'''Namora''' ('''Aquaria Nautica Neptunia''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She is from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] and is the daughter of an Atlantean father and a human mother. She is the cousin of [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]].

==Publication history==
Namora first appeared in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #82 (May 1947), and was created by [[Ken Bald]] and [[Syd Shores]]. She had her own comic book series, ''Namora'' #1-3, which ran from August-December 1948. While this title lasted only three issues, she regularly appeared with Namor in [[Marvel Mystery Comics]] and [[Sub-Mariner]] (and in the latter until the series ended in the mid-fifties).

The character was not seen again for some time until her first modern appearance in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] ''Sub-Mariner'' series, in ''Sub-Mariner'' #33 (January 1971). She made an appearance in ''Marvel Feature'' #2 (March 1972), but was killed off in flashback in ''Sub-Mariner'' #50 (June 1972).

Over the next 30 years, Namora appeared in a number of flashbacks and alternate reality stories, including ''What If?'' #9 (June 1978), ''The New Warriors Annual'' #1 (1991), ''What If?'' #47 (March 1993), ''The New Warriors'' #44 (February 1994), ''Avengers: Forever'' #4-5 (March-April 1999), and ''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #3-2 (December 2000-January 2001).

Namora eventually reappears, alive, in the ''Agents of Atlas'' series, in issues #1-6 (October 2006-March 2007). She also appears in ''Incredible Hulk'' #107-112 (August-December 2007), ''Giant-Size Marvel Adventures: Avengers'' #1 (September 2007), ''World War Hulk'' #2 (September 2007), ''Spider-Man Family'' #4 (October 2007), and ''Incredible Hercules'' #121-122 (November-December 2008).

Namora received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Golden Age 2004 (2004).

==Fictional character biography==
Namora is a character that originated in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed "Namora" in honor of her cousin Namor. Like Namor, she is a hybrid mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for "Avenging Daughter", as Namor means "Avenging Son".  She was Namor's cousin (though not by blood), and became his companion for a period of several years.

Namora was ultimately shown to have been fatally poisoned by the Lemurian terrorist [[Llyra]].<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #50</ref>  She was survived by her [[cloning|clone]], [[Namorita]], whom she had passed off as her birth daughter because of Atlantian taboos against cloning.  ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' revealed that she had been a member of The [[Monster Hunters]] in 1956.

===Agents of Atlas===
{{main|Agents of Atlas}}
Some time later, the [[Agents of Atlas]] find a damaged coffin, which appears to contain the mummified corpse of Namora.<ref>''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #3</ref> Upon closer inspection, [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]] disables a holographic display creating the corpse image, revealing a well-preserved, alive Namora inside the coffin.
When awakened, Namora joins in a fight against underwater sea creatures and we are shown just how powerful she is. Probably the first time in her history she is shown to be equal in power to her cousin, [[Namor]].<ref>''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #4</ref>
 
[[Jimmy Woo]] offers her a spot, and Namora joins the [[Agents of Atlas]], where she leads [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] to recover all memories of her past life as a [[siren]], almost driving her mad in the process. It is then revealed by the enhanced bliss inducing powers of the naiad that Namora's innermost desire is to sleep with her cousin Namor.<ref>''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #5</ref>

Eventually the team manages to reach the [[Yellow Claw]], revealed as the mastermind behind the Atlas Foundation, and willing to give his leading role to Jimmy Woo. Woo accepts, and Namora, as the other Agents, are employed to travel the world in Marvel Boy's spaceship to shut down any rebellious cell still pursuing criminal objectives.<ref>''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #6</ref>

At some point in her career as an Agent of Atlas she takes an extended leave, or leaves the role altogether, to join [[Amadeus Cho]]'s group during the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' event.<ref name="ih107">''Incredible Hulk'' #107</ref>

===World War Hulk===
{{main|World War Hulk}}
Angry over the death and subsequent vilification of her daughter at the onset of the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] over government registration, Namora joins [[Amadeus Cho]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] to aid the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref name="ih107"/> During the crisis, Hercules ends up holding the entire locality of Manhattan on his shoulders.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

===Amazon-Atlantean War===
In the course of her membership in Cho's group, she shares a genuinely romantic kiss with Hercules.<ref>''Incredible Hulk #111</ref>  Some time later, following the [[Secret Invasion]], Hercules and Amadeus Cho vacation near an Atlantean city, and she and Hercules have a romantic fling.  This is interrupted by an [[Amazons|Amazon]] attack.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #121</ref> Namora aids Hercules in repelling the Amazons and rescuing Cho from their amorous and ultimately fatal attentions.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #124</ref>

===Dark Reign===
The Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of "supervillains", in order to form close ties to Osborn. After some time, the group becomes aware of Norman's [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] to find out that a member of the group is none other than Namora's cousin, [[Namor]]. Upon finding this out, the Agents confront Namor for his involvement in the group. Initially at odds with each other for their recent decisions, Namora and Namor end up kissing and beginning a relationship.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #6</ref> Namora contemplates staying with Namor until it is revealed that it was Atlantean elders that plotted for them to start a relationship and mate a long time ago as human/Atlantean hybrids are so powerful. Namor and Namora decide to part ways as they were unsure how much of their feelings for each other were genuine and how much was due to the secret plotting of the elders.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Namora possesses [[superhuman]] strength and can fly. She is nearly invulnerable as bullets and other missiles cannot penetrate her extremely tough skin. She can swim at superhuman speeds, breathe underwater, and is immune to the cold and pressures of the depths. She can also see better underwater than a normal human. Namora must periodically immerse herself in water to retain her powers and her health.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===

[[Image:EXILES 47image big.jpg|225px|thumb|Namora in ''Exiles''. {{deletable image-caption}}]]

The second Namora  first appeared in ''Exiles'' #46, and was created by [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Mizuki Sakakibara]], and was associated with the multiversal travelers called the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. She is an alternate-Earth counterpart of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], rather than of Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, the [[Earth-616]] Namora. She is a mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. Unlike the Marvel Universe Namor and Namora, she has the blue skin of most Atlanteans.

In Namora's universe, she became an early ally of [[Charles Xavier]] who convinced her to not attack the surface world. She would later do so, after anti-mutant hysteria led to the imprisonment of most mutants. Namora killed all of her Earth's superheroes, having the most difficulty with the [[Fantastic Four]], and she conquered the world and ruled it for decades, before becoming 'unhinged' in time and forced to join the Exiles, much to her chagrin.  Having a haughty attitude, she acted like she was superior to the other members. Still, she was shown that she did care for them, as evidenced when she thought that [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] had killed [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]]. She lashed out at Hyperion, breaking his neck. However, it was for naught. Hyperion recovered quickly and blasted Namora, killing her. The Exiles later sent her body back to her home reality ([[Marvel Multiverse#Known alternate universes|Earth-2189]]) for burial.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
Namora appeared in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] series. In the  story, "Eternity Twilight",  Namora rescued Bruce Banner, who suffered temporary amnesia and have fallen for him not before Banner regained his memory involving the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (who was tall like [[Godzilla]]).  Afterwards, Banner and Namora went back to the surface and helps Earth's heroes battle not only the giant-size Hulk, but also the demon-god, [[Dormammu]].

===Marvel Her-oes===
A teenaged version of Namora appears as one of the main protagonists in the all-ages ''Marvel Her-oes'' series. She attends the same high school as [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]] and [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], and hides her Atlantean heritage by claiming to be an exchange student from Greece under the name of "Namora Aquarius".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.12082.marvel_hotline~colon~_grace_randolph |title=Marvel Hotline: Grace Randolph &#124; Marvel Heroes &#124; Comic News &#124; News |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref>
